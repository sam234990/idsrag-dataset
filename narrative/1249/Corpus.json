{"ori_id":"608b8bcc44bdd6e1c03517468ebad835aa98ec28","title":"The Fatal Dowry","context":"The Fatal Dowry\n The play is set in Dijon in Burgundy in the later part of the fifteenth century, in the aftermath of the battles of Grandson, Morat (both 1476) and Nancy (1477), all mentioned in Act I, scene ii. The protagonist's father, the elder Charalois, was a general who had gone into debt to pay the expenses of his troops; unable to repay those charges, he died in debtor's prison, and his rapacious creditors refuse to release his body for a proper burial. The general's son has taken his cause to court, but his suit is rejected by the judges, led by the hostile Novall Senior, president of the Dijon parlement. The younger Charalois amazes everyone by offering to assume his father's debts and take his place in prison, thus freeing his father's corpse. A retiring judge named Rochmont is impressed by Charalois' courage, virtue, and self-sacrifice, and decides to pay the general's debts himself.\nRochmont has an only daughter named Beaumelle; she is the centre of a set of fashionable and foppish young people, featuring the aristocratic Novall Junior and his hangers-on. Beaumelle's waiting-woman, Bellapert, is a cynical sensualist who tempts her mistress with the idea of marrying to enjoy sexual indulgence with many illicit lovers. Beaumelle's father is so taken with Charalois that he arranges a marriage between the young man and his daughter.\nNovall Junior is irate about the marriage, since he has lost his chance of taking Beaumelle's virginity; but Bellapert assures him that the marriage will work to his advantage. Others, including Charalois' friend Romont, perceive the growing intimacy of Novall Junior and Beaumelle, and try to warn the parties involved\u00e2\u0080\u0094without success. Eventually, Beaumelle consummates her incipient affair with Novall Junior\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Charalois walks in upon them, catching them in the act. Charalois challenges his wife's lover; Novall Junior attempts to avoid the duel, but in the end he fights with Charalois, and is killed.\nCharalois stages a mock trial, with his father-in-law Rochmont as the judge. Rochmont, even in his emotional turmoil, hears Charalois' accusation and Beaumelle's confession, and sentences her to death. Charalois stabs her; Beaumelle dies. Novall Senior discovers his son's death, and has Charalois arrested and prosecuted. Charalois defends himself before the court, and wins an acquittal. One of Novall Junior's followers, however, is an ex-soldier named Pontalier who was redeemed from debtor's prison by the judge's son; repaying that favour, Pontalier stabs and kills Charalois in the court, and in turn is stabbed and killed by Romont.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Fatal Dowry, by Philip Massinger and Nathaniel Field\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It was compiled under the guidance and direction\nof Professor T.\u00c2\u00a0M. Parrott of that institution, and every page of\nit is indebted to him for suggestion, advice, and criticism. I can\nbut inadequately indicate the scope of his painstaking and scholarly\nsupervision, and can even less adequately express my appreciation of\nhis ever-patient aid, which alone made this work possible.\n\nI desire also to acknowledge my debt to Professor J. Duncan Spaeth\nof Princeton University, for his valuable suggestions in regard to\nthe presentation of my material, notably in the Introduction; also to\nProfessor T.\u00c2\u00a0W. Baldwin of Muskingum College and Mr. Henry Bowman,\nboth of them then fellow graduate students of mine at Princeton, for\nassistance on several occasions in matters of special inquiry; and to\nDr. M.\u00c2\u00a0W. Tyler of the Princeton Department of History for directing me\nin clearing up a lego-historical point; and finally to the libraries of\nYale and Columbia Universities for their kind loan of needed books.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nIn the Stationer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Register the following entry is recorded under the\ndate of \u00e2\u0080\u009c30\u00c2\u00ba Martij 1632:\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n  CONSTABLE Entred for his copy vnder the hands of Sir HENRY HERBERT\n    and master _SMITHWICKE_ warden a Tragedy called _the ffatall\n    Dowry_.    Vj d.\n\nIn the year 1632 was published a quarto volume whose title-page was\ninscribed: _The Fatall Dowry_: a Tragedy: As it hath been often Acted\nat the Private House in Blackfriars, by his Majesties Servants.\nWritten by P.\u00c2\u00a0M. and N.\u00c2\u00a0F. London, Printed by John Norton, for Francis\nConstable, and are to be sold at his shop at the Crane, in Pauls\nChurchyard. 1632.\n\nThat the initials by which the authors are designated stand for Philip\nMassinger and Nathaniel Field is undoubted.\n\n\nLATER TEXTS\n\nThere is no other seventeenth century edition of _The Fatal Dowry_. It\nwas included in various subsequent collections, as follows:\n\nI. _The Works of Philip Massinger_--edited by Thomas Coxeter,\n1759--re-issued in 1761, with an introduction by T. Davies.\n\nII. _The Dramatic Works of Philip Massinger_--edited by John Monck\nMason, 1779.\n\nIII. _The Plays of Philip Massinger_--edited by William Gifford, 1805.\nThere was a revised second edition in 1813, which is still regarded as\nthe Standard Massinger Text, and was followed in subsequent editions of\nGifford.\n\nIV. _Modern British Drama_--edited by Sir Walter Scott, 1811. The text\nof this reprint of _The Fatal Dowry_ is Gifford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\nV. _Dramatic Works of Massinger and Ford_--edited by Hartley Coleridge,\n1840 (_et seq._). This follows the text of Gifford.\n\nVI. _The Plays of Philip Massinger._ From the Text of William Gifford.\nWith the Addition of the Tragedy Believe as You List. Edited by Francis\nCunningham, 1867 (_et seq._). The Fatal Dowry in this edition, as in\nthe preceding, is a mere reprint of the Second Edition of Gifford.\n\nVII. _Philip Massinger._ Selected Plays. (Mermaid Series.) Edited by\nArthur Symons, 1887-9 (_et seq._).\n\nIn addition to the above, _The Fatal Dowry_ appeared in _The Plays of\nPhilip Massinger_, adapted for family reading and the use of young\npersons, by the omission of objectionable passages,--edited by Harness,\n1830-1; and another expurgated version was printed in the _Mirror of\nTaste and Dramatic Censor_, 1810. Both of these are based on the text\nof Gifford.\n\nThe edition of Coxeter is closest of all to the Quarto, following even\nmany of its most palpable mistakes, and adding some blunders on its\nown account. Mason accepts practically all of Coxeter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corrections,\nand supplies a great many more variants himself, not all of which are\nvery happy. Both these eighteenth century editors continually contract\nfor the sake of securing a perfectly regular metre (e.\u00c2\u00a0g.: _You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re_\nfor _You are_, I, i, 139; _th\u00e2\u0080\u0099 honours_ for _the honours_, I, ii, 35;\netc.), while Gifford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tendency is to give the full form for even the\ncontractions of the Quarto, changing its _\u00e2\u0080\u0099em\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ to _them\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_, etc.\nGifford can scarce find words sharp enough to express his scorn for his\npredecessors in their lack of observance of the text of the Quarto,\nyet he himself frequently repeats their gratuitous emendations when\nthe original was a perfectly sure guide, and he has almost a mania for\ntampering with the Quarto on his own account. Symons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 _Mermaid_ text,\nwhile based essentially on that of Gifford, in a number of instances\ndeparts from it, sometimes to make further emendations, but more often\nto go back from those of Gifford to the version of the original, so\nthat on the whole this is the best text yet published.\n\nThere has been a German translation by the Graf von Baudisson, under\nthe title of _Die Unselige Mitgift_, in his _Ben Jonson und seine\nSchule_, Leipsig, 1836; and a French translation, in prose, under\nthe title of _La dot fatale_ by E. Lafond in _Contemporains de\nShakespeare_, Paris, 1864.\n\n\nDATE\n\nThe date of the composition or original production of _The Fatal Dowry_\nis not known. The Quarto speaks of it as having been \u00e2\u0080\u009coften acted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so\nthere is nothing to prevent our supposing that it came into existence\nmany years before its publication. It does not seem to have been\nentered in Sir Henry Herbert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office Book.[1] This would indicate its\nappearance to have been prior to Herbert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assumption of the duties of\nhis office in August, 1623. In seeking a more precise date we can deal\nonly in probabilities.[2]\n\nThe play having been produced by the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Men, a company in which\nField acted, it was most probably written during his association\ntherewith. This was formed in 1616; the precise date of his retirement\nfrom the stage is not known. His name appears in the patent of March\n27, 1619, just after the death of Burbage, and again and for the last\ntime in a livery list for his Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Servants, dated May 19, 1619.\nIt is absent from the next grant for livery (1621) and from the actors\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nlists for various plays which are assigned to 1619 or 1620. We may\ntherefore assume safely that his connection with the stage ended before\nthe close of 1619. On the basis of probability, then, the field is\nnarrowed to 1616-19.[3]\n\nMore or less presumptive evidence may be adduced for a yet more\nspecific dating. During these years that Field acted with the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nMen, two plays appeared which bear strong internal evidence of being\nproducts of his collaboration with Massinger and Fletcher: _The Knight\nof Malta_ and _The Queen of Corinth_. While several parallels of\nphraseology are afforded for _The Fatal Dowry_ by these (as, indeed, by\nevery one of the works of Massinger) they are not nearly so numerous\nor so striking as similarities discoverable between it and certain\nother dramas of the Massinger _corpus_. With none does the connection\nseem so intimate as with _The Unnatural Combat_. Both plays open with\na scene in which a young suppliant for a father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cause is counseled,\nin passages irresistibly reminiscent of each other, to lay aside pride\nand modesty for the parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, because not otherwise can justice\nbe gained, and it is the custom of the age to sue for it shamelessly.\nMoreover, the offer by Beaufort and his associates to Malefort of any\nboon he may desire as a recompense for his service, and his acceptance\nof it, correspond strikingly in both conduct and language with the\nconferring of a like favor upon Rochfort by the Court (I, ii, 258\nff.); while the request which Malefort prefers, that his daughter be\nmarried to Beaufort Junior, and the language with which that young man\nacknowledges this meets his own dearest wish, bear a no less patent\nresemblance to the bestowal of Beaumelle upon Charalois (II, ii,\n284-297). Now this last parallel is significant, because _The Unnatural\nCombat_ is an unaided production of Massinger, while the analogue in\n_The Fatal Dowry_ occurs in a scene that is by the hand of Field. The\nsimilarity may, of course, be only an accident, but presumably it is\nnot. Then did Field borrow from Massinger, or did Massinger from Field?\nThe most plausible theory is that _The Unnatural Combat_ was written\nimmediately after _The Fatal Dowry_, when Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind was so\nsaturated with the contents of the tragedy just laid aside that he was\nliable to echo in the new drama the expressions and import of lines in\nthe old, whether by himself or his collaborator. That at any rate the\nchronological relationship of the two plays is one of juxtaposition is\nfurther attested by the fact that in minor parallelisms,[4] too, to\n_The Fatal Dowry_, _The Unnatural Combat_ is richer than any other work\nof Massinger.\n\nUnfortunately _The Unnatural Combat_ is itself another play of whose\ndate no more can be said with assurance than that it preceeds the entry\nof Sir Henry Herbert into office in 1623, though its crude horrors,\nits ghost, etc., suggest moreover that it is its author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial\nindependent venture in the field of tragedy, his _Titus Andronicus_, an\nill-advised attempt to produce something after the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrand manner\u00e2\u0080\u009d of\nhalf a generation back. Next in closeness to _The Fatal Dowry_ among\nthe works of Massinger as regards the number of its reminiscences of\nphraseology stands his share of _The Virgin Martyr_; next in closeness\nas regards the _strikingness_ of these parallels stands his share of\n_The Little French Lawyer_. These two plays can be dated _circa_ 1620.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo sum up:\n\n_The Fatal Dowry_ appears to antedate the installation of Sir Henry\nHerbert in 1623.\n\nIt was probably written while Field was with the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Men; with whom\nhe became associated in 1616, and whom he probably quitted in 1619.\n\nThe indications point to its composition during the latter part of this\nthree-year period (1616-19), for it yields more and closer parallels\nto _The Virgin Martyr_ and _The Little French Lawyer_, dated about\n1620, than to _The Knight of Malta_ and _The Queen of Corinth_, dated\n1617-8,--closer, indeed, than to any work of Massinger save one, _The\nUnnatural Combat_, itself an undated but evidently early play, with\nwhich its relationship is clearly of the most intimate variety.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe following (at best hazardously conjectural) scheme of sequence may\nbe advanced:\n\nFletcher and Massinger and Field together wrote _The Knight of Malta_\nand _The Queen of Corinth_--according to received theory, in 1617 or\n1618. Thereafter, the last two collaborators (desirous, perhaps, of\ntrying what they could do unaided and unshackled by the dominating\nassociation of the chief dramatist of the day) joined hands in the\nproduction of the tragedy which is the subject of our study. Then, upon\nField\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retirement, Massinger struck off, with _The Unnatural Combat_,\ninto unassisted composition; but we next find him, whether because he\nrecognized the short-comings of this turgid play or for other reasons,\nagain in double harness, at work upon _The Virgin Martyr_ and _The\nLittle French Lawyer_. On this hypothesis, _The Fatal Dowry_ would be\ndated 1618-9.\n\n\nSOURCES\n\nNo source is known for the main plot of _The Fatal Dowry_. A Spanish\noriginal has been suspected, but it has never come to light. The stress\nlaid throughout the action on that peculiarly Spanish conception of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe point of honor\u00e2\u0080\u009d (see under CRITICAL ESTIMATE, in consideration\nof the character of Charalois) is unquestionably suggestive of the\nland south of the Pyrenees, and we have an echo of _Don Quixote_\nin the exclamation of Charalois (III, i, 441): \u00e2\u0080\u009cAway, thou curious\nimpertinent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The identification, however, of the situation at Aymer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhouse in IV, ii with a scene in Cervantes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 _El viejo celoso_ (Obras\nCompletas De Cervantes, Tomo XII, p.\u00c2\u00a0277) is extremely fanciful. The\nonly similarity consists in the circumstance that in both, while the\nhusband is on the stage, the wife, who, unknown to him, entertains\na lover in the next room, is heard speaking within. But this is a\nspontaneous outcry on the part of Beaumelle, who does not suspect the\nproximity of her husband, and her discovery follows, and from this\nthe denouement of the play; whereas in Cervantes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 _entremes_ the wife\ndeliberately calls in bravado to her niece, who is also on-stage, and\nboasts of her lover,--and the husband thinks this is in jest, and\nnothing comes of it but comedy.\n\nThe theme of the son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s redemption of his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corpse by his own\ncaptivity is from the classical story of Cimon and Miltiades, as\nnarrated by Valerius Maximus, De dictis factisque memorabilibus, etc.\nLib. V, cap. III. De ingratis externorum: _Bene egissent Athenienses\ncum Miltiade, si eum post trecenta millia Persarum Marathone devicta,\nin exilium protinus misissent, ac non in carcere et vinculis mori\ncoegissent; sed, ut puto, hactenus saevire adversus optime meritum\nabunde duxerunt: immo ne corpus quidem eius, sic expirare coacti\nsepulturae primus mandari passi sunt, quam filius eius Cimon eisdem\nvinculis se constrigendum traderet. Hanc hereditatem paternam maximi\nducis filius, et futurus ipse aetatis suae dux maximus, solam se\ncrevisse, catenas et carcerem, gloriari potuit._\n\nIn the version of Cornelius Nepos (Vitae, Cimon I) Cimon is\nincarcerated against his will.\n\nThe action of the play is given the historical setting of the later\nfifteenth century wars of Louis XI of France and Charles the Bold of\nBurgundy, although this background is extremely hazy. The hero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name\nis the title which Charles bore while heir-apparent to the Duchy of\nBurgundy; mention is made of Charles himself (\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe warlike Charloyes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI, ii, 171), to Louis (\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe subtill Fox of France, The politique\nLewis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I, ii, 123-4), and to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe more desperate Swisse\u00e2\u0080\u009d (I, ii,\n124), against whom Charles lost his life and the power of Burgundy\nwas broken; while the three great defeats he suffered at their hands,\nGranson, Morat, Nancy, are named in I, ii, 170. Shortly after these\ndisasters the events which the play sets forth must be supposed to\noccur; the parliament by which in our drama Dijon is governed was\nestablished by Louis XI when he annexed Burgundy in 1477 and thereby\nabolished her ducal independence.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION\n\nIt is doubtful if Massinger ever collaborated with any author whose\nmanner harmonized as well with his own as did Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. In his\npartnership with Decker in _The Virgin Martyr_, the alternate hands\nof the two dramatists afford a weird contrast.[5] His union with\nFletcher was less incongruous, but Fletcher was too much inclined to\ntake the bit between his teeth to be a comfortable companion in double\nharness,[6] and at all times his volatile, prodigal genius paired ill\nwith the earnest, painstaking, not over-poetic moralist. But in Field\nMassinger found an associate whose connection with himself was not only\ncongenial, but even beneficial, to the end that together they could\nachieve certain results of which either was individually incapable;\njust as it has been established was the case in the Middleton-Rowley\ncollaboration. To a formal element of verse different, indeed, from\nMassinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, but not obtrusively so, a certain moral fibre of his\nown (perhaps derived from his clerical antecedents), and a like\nfamiliarity with stage technique, Field added qualities which Massinger\nnotably lacked, and thereby complemented him: a light and vigorous\n(if sometimes coarse) comic touch as opposed to Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cumbrous\nhumor; a freshness and first-hand acquaintance with life as opposed to\nMassinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bookishness; a capacity to visualize and individualize\ncharacter as opposed to Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weakness for drawing types rather\nthan people. The fruit of their joint endeavors testifies to a\nharmonious, conscientious, and mutually respecting partnership.\n\nIn consideration of the above, it is surprising how substantially in\naccord are most of the opinions that have been expressed concerning the\nshare of the play written by each author.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA critical reader,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Monck Mason, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill perceive that Rochfort\nand Charalois speak a different language in the Second and Third Acts,\nfrom that which they speak in the first and last, which are undoubtedly\nMassinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; as is also Part of the Fourth Act, but not the whole of\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDr. Ireland, in a postscript to the text of _The Fatal Dowry_ in\nGifford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edition, agrees with Mason in assigning the Second Act\nto Field and also the First Scene of the Fourth Act; the Third\nAct, however, he claims for Massinger, as well as that share of\nthe play with which Mason credits him. Fleay and Boyle, the chief\nmodern commentators who have taken up the question of the division\nof authorship with the aid of metrical tests and other criteria,\nagree fairly well with the speculations of their less scientific\npredecessors, and adopt an intermediate, reconciling position on the\ndisputed Third Act, dividing it between the two dramatists.[7]\n\nBoyle (_Englische Studien_, V, 94) assigns to Massinger Act I; Act III\nas far as line 316; Act IV, Scenes ii, iii, and iv; and the whole of\nAct V, with the exception of Scene ii, lines 80-120, which he considers\nan interpolation of Field, whom he also believes to have revised the\nlatter part of I, ii (from _Exeunt Officers with Romont_ to end).\n\nFleay (_Chron. Eng. Dra._, I, 208) exactly agrees with this division\nsave that the latter part of I, ii, which Boyle believes emended by\nField, he assigns to that author outright; and that he places the\ndivision in Act III twenty-seven lines later (Field after _Manent Char.\nRom._).\n\nIn my own investigation I have used for each Scene the following tests\nto distinguish the hands of the two authors:\n\n(_a_) Broad aesthetic considerations: the comparison of style and\nmethod of treatment with the known work of either dramatist.\n\n(_b_) The test of parallel phrases. Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s habit of repeating\nhimself is notorious. I have gone through the entire body of his\nwork, both that which appears under his name, and that which has been\nassigned to him by modern research in the Beaumont & Fletcher plays,\nand noted all expressions I found analogous to any which occur in\n_The Fatal Dowry_. I have done the same for Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, examining\nhis two comedies, _Woman is a Weathercock_ and _Amends for Ladies_,\nand Acts I and V of _The Knight of Malta_ and III and IV of _The\nQueen of Corinth_, which the consensus of critical opinion recognizes\n(in my judgment, correctly) as his. He is generally believed to have\ncollaborated also in _The Honest Man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fortune_, but the exact extent\nof his work therein is so uncertain that I have not deemed it a proper\nfield from which to adduce evidence. His hand has been asserted by one\nauthority or another to appear in various other plays of the period,\nhe having served, as it were, the role of a literary scapegoat on whom\nit was convenient to father any Scene not identified as belonging to\nBeaumont, Fletcher, or Massinger; but there is no convincing evidence\nfor his participation in the composition of any extant dramas save the\nabove named.\n\n(_c_) Metrical tests. I have computed the figures for _The Fatal Dowry_\nin regard to double or feminine endings and run-on lines. Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nverse displays high percentages (normally 30 per cent, to 45 per cent.)\nin the case of either. Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s verse varies considerably in the matter\nof run-on lines at various periods of his life, but the proportion of\nthem is always smaller than Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. His double endings average\nabout 18 per cent. I have also counted in each Scene the number\nof speeches that end within the line, and that end with the line,\nrespectively. (Speeches ending with fragmentary lines are considered to\nhave mid-line endings.) This is declared by Oliphant (_Eng. Studien_,\nXIV, 72) the surest test for the work of Massinger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis percentage of\nspeeches,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat end where the verses end is ordinarily as low\nas 15.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is a tremendous exaggeration, but it is true that the\nratio of mid-line endings is much higher in Massinger than in any of\nhis contemporaries--commonly 2:1, or higher.\n\nWe find the First Scene of Act I one of those skillful introductions\nto the action which the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstage-poet\u00e2\u0080\u009d knew so well how to handle, for\nwhich reason, probably, he was generally intrusted with the initial\nScene of the plays in which he collaborated. Thoroughly Massingerian\nare its satire upon the degenerate age and its grave, measured\nstyle, rhetorical where it strives to be passionate, and replete\nwith characteristic expressions. Especially striking examples of the\ndramatist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-known and never-failing _penchant_ for the recurrent\nuse of certain ideas and phrases are: _As I could run the hazard of a\ncheck for\u00e2\u0080\u0099t._ (l.\u00c2\u00a010)--cf. [8]C-G. 87 b, 156 b, 327 b; D. V, 328; XI,\n28;--_You shall o\u00e2\u0080\u0099ercome._ (l.\u00c2\u00a0101)--cf. C-G. 230 b, 248 b, 392 a;--and\nll.\u00c2\u00a0183-7--cf. C-G. 206 a, 63 a, 91 a, 134 b. The correspondence\nbetween ll.\u00c2\u00a081-99 and the opening of _The Unnatural Combat_ has already\nbeen remarked on, while further reminiscences of the same passage are\nto be found elsewhere in Massinger (C-G. 104 a, 195 b). Metrical tests\nshow for the Scene 33 per cent. double endings and 29 per cent. run-on\nlines, figures which substantiate the conclusions derivable from a\nscrutiny of its style and content.[9]\n\nIn I, ii Massinger appears in his element, an episode permitting\nopportunities for the forensic fervor which was his especial forte.\nSuch Scenes occur again and again in his plays: the conversion of\nthe daughters of Theophilus by the Virgin Martyr, the plea of the\nDuke of Milan to the Emperor, of old Malefort to his judges in _The\nUnnatural Combat_, of Antiochus to the Carthagenian senate in _Believe\nas You List_. From the speech with which Du Croy opens court (I, ii,\n1-3)--cf. the inauguration of the senate-house scene in _The Roman\nActor_, C-G. 197 b,\n\n  _Fathers conscript, may this our meeting be\n  Happy to Caesar and the commonwealth!_\n\n--to the very end, it abounds with Massingerisms: _Knowing judgment_;\n_Speak to the cause_; _I foresaw this_ (an especial favorite of the\npoet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s); _Strange boldness!_; the construction, _If that curses_,\netc;--also cf. l.\u00c2\u00a0117 ff. with\n\n  _To undervalue him whose least fam\u00e2\u0080\u0099d service\n  Scornes to be put in ballance with the best\n  Of all your Counsailes._\n\n      (_Sir John van Olden B._, Bullen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Old Plays_, II, 232.)\n\nWe have seen that the hand of Field has been asserted to appear in the\nlast half of this Scene. This is probably due to the presence here of\nseveral rhymed couplets, which are uncommon in Massinger save as tags\nat the end of Scenes or of impressive speeches, but not absolutely\nunknown in his work; whereas Field employs them frequently--in\nparticular to set off a gnomic utterance. If Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indeed, they\ncan scarcely represent more than his revising touch here and there;\neverything else in this part of the Scene bespeaks Massinger no less\nclearly than does the portion which preceeds it. There continues the\nsame stately declamation, punctuated at intervals by brief comments\nor replies, the same periodic sentence-structure, the same or even\ngreater frequency of characteristic diction. Massinger again and again\nrefers in his plays to the successive hardships of the summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heat\nand winter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frost (l.\u00c2\u00a0184--cf. C-G. 168 b, 205 a, 392 b, 488 b);\n_stand bound_ occurs literally scores of times upon his pages (three\ntimes on C-G. 77 a alone);--typical also are _in their dreadful ruins\nburied quick_ (l.\u00c2\u00a0178--cf. C-G. 603 a, 625 a, _Sir John van Olden B._,\nBullin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Old Plays_, II, 209), _Be constant in it_ (l.\u00c2\u00a0196--cf. C-G.\n2 a, 137 a, 237 a, 329 a), _Strange rashness!_, _It is my wonder_\n(l.\u00c2\u00a0293--cf. C-G. 26 b, 195 b; D. VIII, 438; XI, 34). Cf. also l.\u00c2\u00a0156,\n\n  _To quit the burthen of a hopeless life,_\n\nwith C-G. 615 b,\n\n  _To ease the burthen of a wretched life._\n\nAnd ll.\u00c2\u00a0284-6,\n\n                _But would you had\n  Made trial of my love in anything\n  But this,_\n\nwith C-G. 286 a,\n\n                _I could wish you had\n  Made trial of my love some other way._\n\nAnd again, ll.\u00c2\u00a0301-3,\n\n                  _and his goodness\n  Rising above his fortune, seems to me,\n  Princelike, to will, not ask, a courtesy._\n\nwith D. XI. 37,\n\n                    _in his face appears\n  A kind of majesty which should command,\n  Not sue for favour._\n\nand the general likeness of l.\u00c2\u00a0258 ff. with C-G. 44 b-45 a, as above\nnoted. Nor do the verse tests reveal any break in the continuity of\nthe Scene; the figures for the first part are: double endings, 45 per\ncent.; run-on lines, 33 per cent.--for the second part: double endings,\n36 per cent.; run-on lines, 36 per cent.\n\nPassing to the Second Act, we discover at once a new manner of\nexpression, in which the sentence has a looser structure, the verse\na quicker _tempo_, the poetry a striving now and again for a note of\nlyric beauty which, although satisfactorily achieved in but few lines,\nis by Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s verse not even attempted. A liberal sprinkling\nof rhymes appears. The Scene is a trifle more vividly conceived;\nthe emotions have a somewhat more genuine ring. Simultaneously,\nresemblances to the phraseology of Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other plays become\ninfrequent; _and, to increase the wonder_, is almost the only reminder\nof him in the whole of Scene i. On the other hand we must not expect\nto find in the work of Field the same large number of recognizable\nexpressions as mark that of Massinger; for he was not nearly so given\nto repeating himself, nor are there many of his plays extant from\nwhich to garner parallels. The figure of speech with which Charalois\nopens his funeral address [Field shows a great predilection for\n\u00e2\u0080\u009caqueous\u00e2\u0080\u009d similes and metaphors], the liberal use of oaths (_\u00e2\u0080\u0099Slid_,\n_\u00e2\u0080\u0099Slight_), a reference (l.\u00c2\u00a0137) to the Bermudas (also mentioned\nin _Amends for Ladies_: M. 427), and the comparison to the oak and\npine (ll.\u00c2\u00a0119-121--cf. a Field Scene of _The Queen of Corinth_: D. V,\n436-7) are the only specific minutia to which a finger can be pointed.\nThe verse analysis testifies similarly to a different author from\nthat of Act I, double endings being 20 per cent., run-on lines 15 per\ncent.--figures which are quite normal to Field.\n\nTo the actor-dramatist may be set down the prose of II, ii without\nquestion. Massinger practically never uses prose, which is liberally\nemployed by Field, as is the almost indistinguishable prose-or-verse by\nwhich a transition is made from one medium to the other. The dialogue\nbetween Beaumelle and her maids is strikingly like that between two\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cgentlewomen\u00e2\u0080\u009d in _The Knight of Malta_, I, ii--a Scene generally\nrecognized as by his hand; the visit of Novall Junior which follows\nis like a page out of his earlier comedies. Notable resemblances are\nll.\u00c2\u00a0177-8, _Uds-light! my lord, one of the purls of your band is,\nwithout all discipline, fallen out of his rank_, with _I have seen him\nsit discontented a whole play because one of the purls of his band was\nfallen out of his reach to order again_. (_Amends for Ladies_, M. 455);\nand l.\u00c2\u00a0104, _they skip into my lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cast skins some twice a year_,\nwith _and then my lord_ (_like a snake_) _casts a suite every quarter,\nwhich I slip into_: (_Woman is a Weathercock_, M. 374). The song, after\nl.\u00c2\u00a0131, recalls that in _Amends for Ladies_, M. 465.\n\nOf the verse which follows, most of the observations made in regard to\nthe preceeding Scene are applicable. The comic touch in the midst of\nRomont\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tirade (ll.\u00c2\u00a0174-206) against old Novall, when the vehemence\nof his indignation leads him to seek at every breath the epithet of\na different beast for his foe, is surely Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, not Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. A\nField scene of _The Queen of Corinth_, D. V, 438, parallels with its\n_Thou a gentleman! thou an ass_, the construction of l.\u00c2\u00a0276, while\nthere too is duplicated the _true-love knots_ of l.\u00c2\u00a0314, though in a\nrather grotesque connection. The verse tests are confirmative of Field:\n21 per cent. double endings; 19 per cent, run-on lines. While a few\nresemblances to phrases occurring somewhere in the works of Massinger\ncan be marked here and there in the 355 lines of the Scene, they are\nnot such as would demand consideration, nor are more numerous than\nsheer chance would yield in the case of a writer so prolific as the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cstage-poet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The parallel between ll.\u00c2\u00a0284-297 and a passage from _The\nUnnatural Combat_ is pointed out under the head of DATE, and one of\nseveral possible explanations for this coincidence is there offered.\nThese lines in _The Fatal Dowry_ are as unmistakably Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as any\nverse in the entire play; their short, abruptly broken periods and\ntheir rapid flow are as characteristic of him as the style of their\nanalogue in _The Unnatural Combat_ is patently Massingerian.\n\nAct III presents a more difficult problem. It will be noted that Fleay\nand Boyle alike declare that its single long Scene is divided between\nthe two authors, but are unable to agree as to the point of division.\nThe first 316 lines are beyond question the work of Massinger. The tilt\nbetween Romont and Beaumelle is conducted with that flood of rhetorical\nvituperation by which he customarily attempts to delineate passion;\nin no portion of the play is his diction and sentence-structure more\nmarked; and the parallels to passages elsewhere in his works reappear\nwith redoubled profusion. Indeed, they become too numerous for complete\ncitation; let it suffice to refer ll.\u00c2\u00a043-4 to D. III, 477; ll.\u00c2\u00a053-4 to\nC-G. 173 a; ll.\u00c2\u00a080-3 to D. III, 481; l.\u00c2\u00a0104 to C-G. 532 a; l.\u00c2\u00a0116 to\nC-G. 146 b; ll.\u00c2\u00a0117-8 to D. VI, 294 and D. VI, 410; ll.\u00c2\u00a0232-5 to C-G.\n307 a, also to 475 b, and to D. VIII, 406; while the phrase, _Meet with\nan ill construction_ (l.\u00c2\u00a0238) is a common one with Massinger (cf. C-G.\n76 a, 141 b, 193 b, 225 b, 339 b), as are such ironic observations as\nthe _Why, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis exceeding well_ of l. 293 (cf., e.\u00c2\u00a0g., 175 b). This part\nof the Scene contains 45 per cent. double endings and 36 per cent.\nrun-on lines.\n\nThe last 161 lines of the Act with scarcely less certainty can be\nestablished as Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, though on a first reading one might imagine,\nfrom the wordiness of the vehement dialogue and the rather high ratio\n(19:11) of speeches ending in mid-line, that the hand of Massinger\ncontinues throughout. But the closest examination no longer will reveal\ntraces of that playwright\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distinctive handiwork, while a ratio of 17\nper cent. for double endings and 28 per cent. for run-on lines, the\nintroduction of rhyme, the oaths, and the change from the previous\nfull-flowing declamation to shorter, more abrupt periods are vouchers\nthat this part of the Scene is from the pen of the actor-dramatist. We\ncan scarcely imagine the ponderous-styled Massinger writing anything\nso easy and rapid as\n\n                            _I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll die first.\n  Farewell; continue merry, and high heaven\n  Keep your wife chaste._\n\nSuch phrases as _So I not heard them_ (l.\u00c2\u00a0352) and _Like George\na-horseback_ (l.\u00c2\u00a0433) in the loose structure of the one and the slangy\nscurrility of the other, exhibit no kinship to his manner; l.\u00c2\u00a0373,\n_They are fools that judge me by my outward seeming_ recalls a Field\npassage in _The Queen of Corinth_ (D. V, 444) _They are fools that hold\nthem dignified by blood_. There is here and there, moreover, a certain\nviolence of expression, a compressed over-trenchancy of phrase, that\nbrings to mind the rant of the early Elizabethans, and is found among\nthe Jacobeans only in the work of Rowley, Beaumont, and Field. For the\nlast named, this is notably exemplified in the opening soliloquy of\n_The Knight of Malta_; we cannot but recognize the same touch here in\nll.\u00c2\u00a0386-8:\n\n                        _Thou dost strike\n  A deathful coldness to my heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high heat,\n  And shrink\u00e2\u0080\u0099st my liver like the calenture._\n\nThe _Something I must do_, which concludes the Act, is repeatedly\nparalleled in Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plays, but a similar indefinite resolve is\nexpressed in _Woman is a Weathercock_ (M. 363), and it consequently\ncannot be adduced as evidence of his hand. Immediately above, however\n(ll.\u00c2\u00a0494-6), we encounter, in the allusion to the Italian and Dutch\ntemperaments, a thought twice echoed by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstage-poet\u00e2\u0080\u009d in plays of\nnot greatly later date, _The Duke of Milan_ and _The Little French\nLawyer_ (C-G. 90 a; D. III, 505). It may represent an interpolation by\nMassinger; it may be merely that this rather striking conclusion to the\nclimatic speech of his collaborator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scene so fixed itself on his mind\nas to crop out afterwards in his own productions.\n\nIn the short disputed passage (ll.\u00c2\u00a0317-343) which separates what is\nundoubtedly Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s from what is undoubtedly Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, it would\nappear that both playwrights had a hand. The _\u00e2\u0080\u0099Sdeath and Gads me!_,\nthe play upon the word _currier_, and the phrase, _I shall be with\nyou suddenly_ (cf. _Q. of Cor._ D. V, 467) speak for Field; while\nMassinger, on the other hand, parallels\n\n                          _His back\n  Appears to me as it would tire a beadle;_\n\nwith\n\n  _A man of resolution, whose shoulders\n  Are of themselves armour of proof, against\n  A bastinado, and will tire ten beadles._--C-G. 186 b;\n\nand the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cto sit down with a disgrace\u00e2\u0080\u009d occurs something like a\ndozen times on his pages, especially frequently in the collaborated\nplays--that is to say, in the earlier period of his work, to which\n_The Fatal Dowry_ belongs. It is probable, and not unnatural, that\nthe labors of the partners in composition overlapped on this bit of\nthe Scene, but metrical analysis claims with as much certainty as\ncan attach to this test in the case of so short a passage that it is\nsubstantially Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and should go rather with what preceeds than\nwith what comes after it, the verse being all one piece with that of\nthe former section. It has 37 per cent. double endings and 41 per cent.\nrun-on lines.\n\nIV, i, opens with a prose passage for all the world like that of\n_Woman is a Weathercock_, I, ii, with its picture of the dandy, his\nparasites, and the pert page who forms a sort of chorus with his\ncaustic _asides_; and writes itself down indisputably as by the same\nauthor. Novall Junior and his coterie appear here as in their former\npresentation in II, ii. We have again the same racy comedy, the same\nfaltering of the vehicle between verse and prose (see ll.\u00c2\u00a061-8;\n137-153). After the clearing of the stage of all save Romont and young\nNovall, uninterrupted verse ensues, which, despite a rather notable\nparallel in _The Beggars\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Bush_, D. IX, 9 to l.\u00c2\u00a0174, is evidently\nField\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also. An analogue of ll. 180-1 is discoverable in _Amends\nfor Ladies_ (M. 421), as is of the reference (l.\u00c2\u00a0197) to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ntreasure\u00e2\u0080\u009d in _Woman is a Weathercock_ (M. 344). Novall\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exclamation\n(l.\u00c2\u00a0182), _Pox of this gun!_ and his retort (l.\u00c2\u00a0201), _Good devil to\nyour rogueship!_ are Fieldian, and the entire passage possesses a\nvigor and an easy naturalness which declare his authorship. It is not\nimprobable, however, that his contribution ends with the fragmentary\nl.\u00c2\u00a0207, and that the remaining four lines of the Scene are a Massinger\ntag. _The Maid of Honour_ (C-G. 28 a) furnishes a striking parallel\nfor ll.\u00c2\u00a0208-9, while for 210-1 cf. C-G. 192 a. The metrical tests for\nIV, i, confirm Field: 22 per cent. double endings; 22 per cent. run-on\nlines.\n\nWith the next Scene the hand of Massinger is once more in evidence with\nall its accustomed manifestations. One interested in his duplication of\ncharacteristic phrasing may refer for comparison ll.\u00c2\u00a013-4 to C-G. 299\nb; l.\u00c2\u00a017 to C-G. 241 a; ll.\u00c2\u00a024-6 to C-G. 547 b; ll.\u00c2\u00a029-30 to C-G. 425\nb; l.\u00c2\u00a057 to C-G. 41 b, 70 b; l.\u00c2\u00a094 to C-G. 182 b. The Scene contains 32\nper cent. double endings and 37 per cent. run-on lines. The authorship\nof its two songs is less certain. Field was more given to song-writing\nthan was Massinger, and the second of this pair is reminiscent in its\nconception of the Grace Seldom episode in _Amends for Ladies_ (II, i).\n\nThe short IV, iii is by Massinger. In evidence of him are its 36 per\ncent. of double endings and 55 per cent. of run-on lines, its involved\nsentence structure, and the familiar phrasing which makes itself\nmanifest even in so brief a passage (e.\u00c2\u00a0g.: _To play the parasite_,\nl.\u00c2\u00a07--cf. V, iii, 78 and C-G. 334 b. Cf. also ll.\u00c2\u00a09-10 with D. III,\n476; and l.\u00c2\u00a022 with C-G. 40 b, 153 a, 262 b.).\n\nThe same dramatist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work continues through the last Scene of the Act.\nThis, the emotional climax of the play, representing a quasi-judicial\nprocedure, affords him abundant opportunity for fervid moralizing and\nspeech-making, of which he takes advantage most typically. Massinger\ncommonplaces are l.\u00c2\u00a029, _Made shipwreck of your faith_ (cf. C-G. 55 b,\n235 a, 414 b); l.\u00c2\u00a056, _In the forbidden labyrinth of lust_ (cf. C-G.\n298 b); l.\u00c2\u00a089, _Angels guard me!_ (cf. C-G. 59 b, 475 b); l.\u00c2\u00a0118-9,\n_and yield myself Most miserably guilty_ (cf. C-G. 61 b, 66 b, 130\na; D. VI, 354); etc.; while within a year or so of the time when he\nwrote referring to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose famed matrons\u00e2\u0080\u009d (l.\u00c2\u00a070), he expatiated upon\nthem in detail (see _The Virgin Martyr_, C-G. 33 a). Yet more specific\nparallels may be found: for l.\u00c2\u00a063 cf. C-G. 179 a; ll.\u00c2\u00a076-7, cf. C-G. 28\na; l.\u00c2\u00a078, cf. C-G. 32 b; ll.\u00c2\u00a0162-3, cf. C-G. 3 b, in a passage wherein\nthere is a certain similarity of situation; l.\u00c2\u00a0177, cf. D. IX, 7.\nWere any further confirmation needed for Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authorship, the\nmetrical tests would supply it, with their 36 per cent. double endings\nand 34 per cent. run-on lines.\n\nThe most cursory reading of V, i is sufficient to establish the\nconviction that its author is not identical with that of the earlier\ncomic passages--is not Field, but Massinger. The humor, such as it is,\nis of a graver, more restrained sort--satiric rather than burlesque; it\nhas lost lightness and verve, and approaches to high-comedy and even\nto moralizing. One feels that the confession of the tailor-gallant is\nno mere fun-making devise, but a caustic attack upon social conditions\nagainst which the writer nurtured a grudge. Massingerian are such\nexpressions as _And now I think on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t better_ (l.\u00c2\u00a077--cf. C-G. 57 b,\n468 a, 615 a; D. XI, 28), and _use a conscience_ (l.\u00c2\u00a090--cf. C-G. 444\na, 453 a), while the metrical evidence of 36 per cent. double endings\nand 29 per cent. run-on lines fortifies a case concerning which all\ncommentators are in agreement. But despite the unanimity of critical\nopinion hitherto, I am not sure that Field did not contribute a minor\ntouch here and there to the Scene. Such contribution, if a fact, must\nhave been small, for the Massinger flavor is unmistakable throughout;\nyet in the _Plague on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!_ and the _\u00e2\u0080\u0099Slid!_, in the play upon words\n(ll.\u00c2\u00a013-4, 20-1, 44), which is rare with Massinger and common with\nField, in the line, _I only know_ [_thee_] _now to hate thee deadly_:\n(cf. _Amends for Ladies_, M. 421: _I never more Will hear or see thee,\nbut will hate thee deadly._), we may, perhaps, detect a hint of his\nhand.\n\nScene ii (which in the Quarto ends with the reconciliation of Charalois\nand Romont, the entry of Du Croy, Charmi, etc. being marked as the\nbeginning of a third Scene, though the place is unchanged and the\naction continuous, wherefore modern editors disregard the Quarto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndivision and count Scene ii as including all the remainder of the Act)\npresents the usual distinctive earmarks of a Massinger passage. The\nlast third of it, however (ll.\u00c2\u00a080-121), has, on account of the presence\nof several rhymes, been commonly assigned to Field. No doubt his hand\nis here discernable; l.\u00c2\u00a0118, _mark\u00e2\u0080\u0099d me out the way how to defend it_,\nis scarcely a Massinger construction either; but I cannot think Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npresence here more than that of a reviser, just as in the latter half\nof I, ii. The language remains more Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s than Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; and while\nthe passage is over-short for metrical tests to be decisive, the 39\nper cent. of double endings and 35 per cent. of run-on lines which it\nyields (for the earlier part of the Scene the figures are respectively\n28 per cent. and 35 per cent.) are corroborative of Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nauthorship. Cf. also ll.\u00c2\u00a096-8 with this from _The Renegado_ (C-G. 157\na):\n\n                          _This applause\n  Confirm\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in your allowance, joys me more\n  Than if a thousand full-cramm\u00e2\u0080\u0099d theatres\n  Should clap their eager hands._\n\nOf the final Scene, V, iii, little need be said. It brings before us\nagain a court-room, with another trial, and continues the manner of\nits predecessor, I, ii, as only Massinger can. His customary formulae,\n_stand bound_, _play the parasite_, etc., are here; characteristic too\nare his opposition of _wanton heat_ and _lawful fires_ (ll.\u00c2\u00a0141-2--cf.\nC-G. 37 b; D.\u00c2\u00a0V. 476), while further material for comparison may be\nfound in ll.\u00c2\u00a095-6 with _Respect_, _wealth_, _favour_, _the whole world\nfor a dower_ of _The Virgin Martyr_ (C-G. 6 b), and in ll.\u00c2\u00a0165-7:\n\n  Char. _You must find other proofs to strengthen these\n  But mere presumptions._\n\n  Du Croy               _Or we shall hardly\n  Allow your innocence._\n\nwith C-G. 39 a and b:\n\n                 _You must produce\n  Reasons of more validity and weight\n  To plead in your defence, or we shall hardly\n  Conclude you innocent._\n\nThe last passage cited for comparison also exhibits another feature\nnormal to the work of this dramatist: the splitting of an observation,\nfrequently a single sentence, between two speakers; so ll.\u00c2\u00a038-9, and\nagain, l.\u00c2\u00a059. The Scene and play are rounded off with the pointing of a\nmoral, so indispensable to Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s satisfaction.\n\nTo sum up, therefore, disregarding for practical purposes the slight\ntouches of Field in I, ii, ll.\u00c2\u00a0146-_end_; III, i, ll.\u00c2\u00a0317-343; V, ii,\nll.\u00c2\u00a080-_end_; and perhaps in V, i;--and the apparent Massinger touches\nin IV, i, and possibly at one or two other points in the Field Scenes,\nwe may divide the play as follows:\n\nMASSINGER: I; III, ll.\u00c2\u00a01-343; IV, ii, iii, iv; V.\n\nFIELD: II; III, ll.\u00c2\u00a0344-_end_; IV, i.\n\nA metrical analysis of the play is appended in tabular form, in\nwhich I have computed separately the figures for each portion of any\nScene on which there has been a question.

Certainly it would be\nthe most formidable rival of _The Duke of Milan_ for that distinction.\nIt occupies an anomalous position among the works of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstage\npoet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His dramas are, as a rule, strongest in construction; he\nwent at play-making like a skillful architect, and put together and\nmoulded his material with steady hand. They are likely to be weakest\nin characterization. Massinger could not get inside his figures and\nendow them with the breath of life; they remain stony shapes chiseled\nin severely angular and conventional lines, like some old Egyptian\nbas-relief. But _The Fatal Dowry_ is strong in characterization and\ndefective in construction.\n\nThe structural fault is less surprising when it is ascertained to be\nfundamental--inevitable in the theme. The play breaks in the middle:\nit is really composed of two stories; the first two Acts present and\nresolve one action, while another, hitherto barely presaged, occupies\nthe last three, and is the proper story of the Fatal Dowry. Charalois\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nself-immolation for the corpse of his heroic father, and his rescue\nand reward by the great-hearted Rochfort, form a little play in\nthemselves--a brief but stately tragi-comedy, which is followed by\na tense drama of intrigue and retribution, of adultery and avenged\nhonor--itself complete in itself, for which we are prepared in the\nfirst two Acts only by one figure, whose potentialities for disaster\nare ominous if not obvious:--Beaumelle, of whom more later. This\nplot-building by _enjambment_ precludes the slow, steady mounting of\nsuspense from the initial moment and inexorable gathering of doom which\nare manifested in a well-conceived tragedy; yet crude, amorphous,\ninorganic as it may seem--defying, as it does, unity of action--like\nas it is to the earliest Elizabethan plays, which were concerned\nwith a single career rather than a single theme, it would appear\ninevitably necessary, if a maximum effect is to be gained from the\ngiven plot-material. Just as Wagner found it impossible to do justice\nto the story of Siegfried without first presenting that of Siegmund\nand Sieglinde, so the experiment of Rowe (who in re-working the story\nfor _The Fair Penitent_ relegated to expository dialogue the narration\nof what corresponds to the first two Acts of _The Fatal Dowry_) sadly\ndemonstrated that unless the reader or audience actually sees, and\nnot merely hears about, Charalois\u00e2\u0080\u0099 previous devotion, Rochfort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngenerosity, and Romont\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loyalty, these characters do not attract to\nthemselves a full measure of sympathy, and the story of their later\nvicissitudes is somehow unconvincing and falls flat.\n\nMassinger and Field accepted frankly the structural awkwardness of\ntheir plot as they had fashioned or found it. Making, apparently, no\nattempt to obviate its essential duality, they went to work in the most\nstraightforward manner, and achieved, thanks in no small measure to\nthat same resolute directness of approach, a drama of so naturalistic\na tone as half to redeem its want of unity. _The Fatal Dowry_ is not\nan Aristotelian tragedy with a definite beginning, middle, and end--it\nis rather a cross-section of life. The unconventionality and vitality\nof such a production are startling, and obtain a high degree of\nverisimilitude.\n\nBoth authors seem to have been themselves inspired by their virile\ntheme to give to it their best work. The stately, somewhat monotonous\nverse of Massinger, which never loses dignity and is so incapable of\nexpressing climaxes of passion, is once or twice almost forgotten,\nor else rises to a majesty which transfigures it. Though forensic\ndeclamation was always the especial forte of this dramatist, he\nliterally out-did himself in his management of the suit for the dead\nMarshal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. The elaborate rhetoric of Charmi, checked by the stern\nharshness of Novall Senior, the indignant outburst of Romont, and the\nsad, yet noble calmness of Charalois\u00e2\u0080\u0099 speech in which he presses the\nforlorn alternative, succeed one another with striking contrast; the\nvery flow of the verse changes with the speaker in a manner which\nrecalls the wonderful employment of this device by Shakespeare, as, for\nexample, in the First Act of _Othello_. In the final Scene of Act IV,\nMassinger achieves a climax worthy of Fletcher himself;--save, perhaps,\nthe _denouement_ of _A New Way to Pay Old Debts_, and the great scene\nin _The Duke of Milan_ in which Sforza\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faith in his Duchess is broken\ndown by aspersion after aspersion, until he slays her, only to learn\nthe terrible truth one instant later, it is the most dramatic situation\nhe ever worked up. Field, too, seems to have been on his mettle: his\nverse is more trenchant, his care greater than in his two earlier\ncomedies; the lines (II, i, 126-7)\n\n  _My root is earthed, and I a desolate branch\n  Left scattered in the highway of the world,_\n\ntouch the high-water mark of his poetic endeavor.\n\nBlemishes, indeed, are not unapparent. The episodic first Scene of Act\nV is a rather stupid piece of pseudo-comedy by Massinger, which serves\nno function adequate to justify its existence, while it interrupts the\nthread of the main story at a point where its culminating intensity\ndoes not, of right, permit such a diversion. Gifford in commenting upon\nthis Scene makes the amazing pronouncement that it serves \u00e2\u0080\u009cto prove\nhow differently the comic part of this drama would have appeared, if\nthe whole had fortunately fallen into the hands of Massinger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Surely\nnever was criticism more fatuous.\n\nBut the most serious--indeed, the outstanding--defect of the play\nis the easy readiness of Charalois to break with Romont. The calm,\nunregretful placidity with which he untwists the long web of friendship\nwith a man who has stood by him through weal and woe, who has courted a\nprison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chains for his sake, shocks us, and repels us with its flinty\nself-sufficiency. It is not that we know him to be wrong and Romont\nto be right; suppose the high faith of Charalois in Beaumelle to be\nentirely justified and the charge of Romont to be as groundless as it\nis wildly delivered and unconvincing, yet there is no excuse for the\n_immediacy_ with which, on the first revelation of what he himself\nhas demanded to know, the hero rejects, along with the report of his\nfriend, the friend himself, whose aim could have been only his best\ninterest. For the fault lies not in the situation, which is sound, but\nin its over-hasty development. A little more length to the scene, a few\nmore speeches to either participant in the dialogue, a little longer\nand more vituperative insistence on the part of Romont in the face\nof Charalois\u00e2\u0080\u0099 warnings that he has gone far enough, and the quarrel\nwould have been thoroughly realized and developed. As it is, it comes\non insufficient provocation; the hero, at the moment when he should\nexcite regret and sympathy because of his blind, mistaken trust in his\nunworthy wife, excites rather indignation; the later words of Romont\nwith which he justifies his unshaken loyalty to his comrade turn back\nthe mind perforce to that comrade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of loyalty to _him_, and\nunwittingly ring out as a judgment upon Charalois:\n\n           _That friendship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raised on sand,\n  Which every sudden gust of discontent,\n  Or flowing of our passions can change,\n  As if it ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er had been:_--\n\nThe faulty passage, it will be noted upon reference to the analysis\nof shares in collaboration, is by the hand of Field. Unconvincing\nprecipitancy in the conduct of situations marks his work elsewhere,\nnotably in the _Amends for Ladies_.\n\nAs it has already been said, the strongest feature of the play is its\ncharacterization. Almost every figure is, if not an individual, at\nleast a type so vitalized as to appear to take on life. One or two\ntouches, to be sure, of conventional Massingerian habits of thought\nstill cling about them; even the noblest cannot entirely forget to\nconsider how their conduct will pose them before the eyes of the world\nand posterity. But apart from such slight occasional lapses, they may\ntruthfully be said to speak and move quite in the manner of real men\nand women.\n\nThe hero, Charalois, is drawn as of a gentle, meditative, temperate,\nand self-possessed disposition, in strong and effective contrast to his\nfriend. Though his military exploits are spoken of with admiration, and\nRomont testifies that he can \u00e2\u0080\u009cpursue a foe like lightning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he betrays\na certain readiness to yield to discouragement scarce to be expected\nin the son of the great general. In consequence of these facts, he has\nbeen described by some (notably Cunningham, in his Edition of Gifford,\nIntroduction, p. xiii;--cf. also Phelan, p.\u00c2\u00a061; and Beck, pp.\u00c2\u00a022-3) as\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ca Hamlet whose mind has not yet been sicklied o\u00e2\u0080\u0099er by the pale cast\nof thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his long silence at the opening of Act I is compared\nto that of the Danish Prince on his first appearance. But, in reality,\nexcess of pride is the chief reason of Charalois\u00e2\u0080\u0099 backwardness on this\noccasion, and thereafter he acts promptly and efficiently always. The\nsame over-sensitive pride continues to manifest itself throughout\nthe play--when he is confronted with Rochfort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generosity; when he\nfinds (III, i, 365 ff.) that it is he who is the object of the jests\nof Novall Junior and his satellites (though scarce a breath earlier\nhe has chided Romont for noticing the yapping of such petty curs);\nand in the viscissitudes of the catastrophe and its consequences. A\nharmonious twin-birth with his pride, at once proceeding from it, bound\nup with it, and on occasion over-weighing its scruples, is an extreme\npunctiliousness at every turn to the dictates of that peculiarly\nSpanish imperative, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe point of honor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--a consideration so prominent\nthroughout the play as to have convinced many critics that the source\nof the story, although still undiscovered, must have been Spanish.\nThese two traits--pride and an adherence to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe point of honor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d are\nalmost invariably the mainsprings of Charalois\u00e2\u0080\u0099 conduct. His pride\nholds him back from supplicating in behalf of his father the clemency\nof the unworthy ministers of the law, till he is persuaded by Romont\nthat honor not only permits but requires that he do so; he feels\nthat honor demands that he sacrifice himself to secure his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nburial, and he does it; that honor demands that he put away his friend\nin loyalty to his wife, and he does it; that honor demands that he\nslay the adulteress--and he does it; he even consents to lay bare the\ndetails of his ignominious wrong before the eyes of men, because he is\nbrought to believe that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe point of honor\u00e2\u0080\u009d calls for a justification\nof his course and the holding of it up as an example to the world.\nIt is a striking and consistent portrait--how unlike the usual\nconventionally noble hero of romantic drama!\n\nRomont, however, is the finest figure of the play. He draws to\nhimself rather more than his share of interest and sympathy, to the\ndetriment of the protagonist. Of a type common enough on the stage\nof that day--the bluff, loyal soldier-friend of the hero--he is yet\nso thoroughly individualized that we can discuss him and calculate\nwhat he will do in given situations, even as with a character of\nShakespeare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. The portrait suffers from no jarring inconsistencies;\nalmost his every utterance is absolutely in part, and adds its touch\nto round out our conception of him. His negligence of his personal\nappearance, his quick temper, his impulsiveness, his violence, his\nlack of restraint, his fierce, uncompromising honesty, his devotion\nto the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrave General dead\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his unshaken fidelity to the living\nson, his flashes of unexpected tenderness, his homage for the\nreverend virtue of Rochfort--a sort of child-like awe for what he\nknows is finer if not of truer metal than his own rough spirit, his\nill-disguised scorn for Novall Junior and his creatures, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose dogs\nin doublets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his lack of tact which unfits him for effective service\nin the delicate task of preserving Beaumelle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honor, and dooms his\nstory to Charalois to disbelief and resentment, his prompt, fearless\ndecisiveness of action, the tumultuous flood of nervous and at times\neloquent speech which pours from his lips when he is aroused, yet\ndies in his throat when he is lashed by a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongue--a flood of\nspeech which is most torrential when the situation is most doubtful\nor hopeless of good issue, but which gives place to a self-possessed\nterseness when he is quite sure of his ground:--all go to give detail\nand reality to a character at once amazingly alive and irresistibly\nattractive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRomont is one of the noblest of all Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsays Swinburne, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand Shakespeare has hardly drawn noble men more nobly\nthan Massinger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To find a parallel creation who can over-match him in\nvigor of presentation and theatrical efficiency, we must go back to the\nMelantius of Beaumont and Fletcher. These two characters represent the\nultimate elaborations of the stock figure of the faithful friend and\nblunt soldier; Melantius is the supreme romantic, Romont the supreme\nrealistic, development of the type.\n\nYet though Romont is the most compelling of the _dramatis personae_,\ninto none does Massinger enter more thoroughly than the noble figure of\nRochfort. Utter devotion to virtue, to which he had paid a life-long\nfidelity, is the key-note of the nature of the aged Premier President,\nand accordingly in him the deep-seated ethical seriousness of the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cstage-poet\u00e2\u0080\u009d found a congenial expression. A statelier dignity is wont\nto echo in his lines than in the utterance of any other character; they\nbreathe an exalted calm, a graciousness, a grave courtesy, as though\nthe very spirit of their speaker had entered them.\n\nAn inability to judge the character of others was his great weakness--a\nweakness which he himself realized, for he called upon Beaumont to\nconfirm the one strikingly sure, true appraisement which he exhibited,\nhis admiration for Charalois. Characteristically, this weakness seems\nto have taken the form of a too-generous estimate of his fellows. This\ncaused him to bestow his vacated office upon the harsh and unjust\nNovall, and to be blind to the disposition of his daughter, and the\ndanger that lay in her intimacy with Novall Junior. But if his kindly\nnature saw the better side of even that contemptible young man, he at\nleast understood him well enough not to take him at all seriously as a\nsuitor for Beaumelle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand.\n\nOf the Novalls, father and son, there is a much briefer presentation.\nYet even so, in the case of old Novall we have as masterly a sketch\nas in Romont a detailed study. His every word is eloquent of his\nstern, not to say _mean_, nature--curt and severe towards others, all\nprejudice where he himself is concerned, inexorably malevolent against\nthose who incur his animosity. Yet it never enters his head to seek the\nsatisfaction of his hate in any way save through the law; for example,\nhe does not seize upon, or even think seriously of, Pontalier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proffer\nof private vengeance; the law is his sphere--he will abuse it to his\nadvantage, if he can, but he will not go outside of it. He is, in other\nwords, the Official Bureaucrat _par excellence_, and his enmity against\nthe martial house of the Charaloises and the rigor with which he is\nsaid to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccross every deserved soldier and scholar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, on the other\nhand, the detestation in which Romont holds him, are manifestations of\nthe feud of type against type. It has been suggested that the especial\nfervor with which he is devoted to execration argues a prototype in\nactual life, and that in him is to be recognized Sir Edward Coke,\nnotorious for the savage vindictiveness of his conduct towards Sir\nWalter Raleigh.\n\nNovall Junior, the cowardly, foppish, and unscrupulous gallant, though\na flimsy personality, affords once or twice, in the Fieldian prose,\nrather good humor: e.\u00c2\u00a0g.--\n\n_Nay, o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 my soul, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis so; what fouler object in the world, than to see\na young, fair, handsome beauty unhandsomely dighted, and incongruently\naccoutred? or a hopeful chevalier unmethodically appointed in the\nexternal ornaments of nature? For, even as the index tells us the\ncontents of stories, and directs to the particular chapters, even so\ndoes the outward habit and superficial order of garments (in man or\nwoman) give us a taste of the spirit, and demonstratively point (as\nit were a manual note from the margin) all the internal quality and\nhabiliment of the soul; and there cannot be a more evident, palpable,\ngross manifestation of poor, degenerate, dunghilly blood and breeding,\nthan a rude, unpolished, disordered, and slovenly outside._ (IV, i,\n48-60.)\n\nOf the remaining characters, only two call for especial notice.\nThe three Creditors are a blemish upon the otherwise striking\nverisimilitude of the play; they are impossible, inhuman monsters of\ngreed and relentlessness, who serve as vehicles for a kind of grotesque\ncomedy. A personal rancour on the part of the authors may have been\nresponsible for this presentation, as it is probable that they\nthemselves had had none-too-pleasant experiences with money-lenders.\nPontalier, however, is very well conceived and skillfully executed.\nOccupying a relation to Novall Junior quite similar to that of Romont\nto Charalois, he is yet differentiated from his parallel, while at\nthe same time he is kept free from any taint of the despicableness\nand fawning servility which are chiefly prominent in the parasites of\nthe vicious and feather-brained young lord. There is something really\npathetic about this brave, honorable soldier, committed to the defense\nof an unworthy benefactor, ranged on the side of wrong against right,\nby his very best qualities: his noble sense of gratitude, his loyalty,\nhis devotion to what he conceives to be his duty. It will be observed\nthat he never joins with the rest of the group about Novall Junior in\ntheir jibes against Charalois and Romont.\n\nThe last figure for consideration, and not the least important, is\nBeaumelle. So general has been the misconception of her character that\nit calls for a more detailed analysis than has been accorded to the\nother personages of the drama, or than the place she occupies might\nappear to warrant. That place, indeed, is not a striking one; she is\nscarce more than a character of second rank, appearing in but few\nscenes and speaking not many lines. Yet her part in the story is one\nof such potentialities that in Rowe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s version of the same theme her\nanalogue becomes the central figure, and even in _The Fatal Dowry_ a\nfailure to understand her has probably been at the bottom of most of\nthe less favorable judgments that have been passed upon the play, while\nthose critics who appraise it higher yet acknowledge her to be its\none outstanding defect. \u00e2\u0080\u009c_The Fatal Dowry_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Saintsbury (_Hist.\nEng. Lit._, vol. ii, p.\u00c2\u00a0400) \u00e2\u0080\u009c... is ... injured by the unattractive\ncharacter of the light-of-love Beaumelle before her repentance\n(Massinger never could draw a woman).\u00e2\u0080\u009d She is declared by Swinburne to\nbe \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo thinly and feebly drawn to attract even the conventional and\ntheatrical sympathy which Fletcher might have excited for a frail and\npenitent heroine: and the almost farcical insignificance and baseness\nof her paramour would suffice to degrade his not involuntary victim\nbeneath the level of any serious interest or pity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If these and\nsimilar pronouncements were well founded, the play as a cross-section\nof life would have the great weakness of being unconvincing at a very\nvital point. A study of the text, however, will discover Beaumelle\nto be portrayed, in the brief compass of her appearance, in no\nwise inadequately, but rather, if anything, somewhat beyond the\nrequirements of her dramatic function--will reveal her, not, indeed,\na personage of heroic proportions and qualities, but a young woman of\nconsiderable naturalness, plausibility, and realistic convincingness.\n\nThe trouble has probably been that the critics of Beaumelle have\npassed hastily over the very scurrilous prose scene in which she first\nappears. They have looked on this passage as merely a piece of Fieldian\nlow-comedy, a coarse bit of buffoonery which pretends to no function\nsave that of humor, and can sustain not even this pretense. Nothing can\nbe further from the truth. The passage _is_ a piece of coarse comedy\nsuch as Field had an over-fondness for writing; but it is something\nmore; in reality, a proper understanding of the heroine is conditioned\nupon it.\n\nBeaumelle is a young girl whose mother, we may infer, has long been\ndead. The cares of the bench have been too great to allow her father\ntime for much personal supervision of her; she has had for associates\nher two maids, and of these she not unnaturally finds the gay and\nwitty, but thoroughly depraved, Bellapert the more congenial, and\nadopts her as her mentor and confidant. She is in love, after a\nfashion--caught, like the impressionable, uncritical girl she is, by\nthe fair exterior of a young magnificent, whose elegant dress and\ncourtly show of devotion quite blind her to his real worthlessness--and\nthere is scant likelihood of her getting the man who has charmed\nher fancy. Her disposition is high-spirited and wayward, but not\ndeliberately vicious; she has certain hazily defined ideals, mingled\nwith the same romantic mist through which the superfine dandy, Novall,\nappears in her eyes a very Prince Charming: she \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould meet love and\nmarriage both at once\u00e2\u0080\u009d; she desires to preserve her honor. She has\nideals, but she doubts their tangibility; she is in an unsettled\nstate of mind, questioning the fundamentals of conduct and social\nrelationships, in much need of good counsel. In that perilous mood\nshe talks with Bellapert--Bellapert, the dearest cabinet of her\nsecrets--Bellapert, the bribed instrument of Novall--and is told\nby that worldly-wise wench that marriage almost never unites with\nlove, but must be used as a cloak for it; that honor is a foolish\nfancy; that a husband is a master to be outwitted and despised. The\nshaft sinks home all too surely; a visit at that very moment by\nBeaumelle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lover completes the conquest, when her father interrupts\ntheir tete-a-tete--her father, who comes with the anouncement that\nshe must marry a man whom she does not even know! In the scene where\nthe destined bride and groom are brought face to face, she stands\nthroughout in stony silence quite as eloquent as the more famous\nspeechlessness of Charalois at the beginning of the play. She has\never been \u00e2\u0080\u009chandmaid\u00e2\u0080\u009d to her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will; she realizes all her hopes\nand fortunes \u00e2\u0080\u009chave reference to his liking;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and now she obeys, with\nthe bitter thought in her heart that Fate, in denying her her will,\nhas wronged Love itself (II, ii, 154); only when Charalois turns to\nher with a direct question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFair Beaumelle, can you love me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d does\nshe utter a word--then from her lips a brief, desperate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my\nlord\u00e2\u0080\u009d--and a moment later (II, ii, 315) she is weeping silently. (Her\nanswer was honest in as far as she really did mean to give to the man\nchosen for her husband her duty with her hand.) Then the voice of the\ntempter whispers in her ear, she feels its tug at her heart, and with a\ncry, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, servant!--Virtue strengthen me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she hurries from the room.\nThat is the situation at the end of the Second Act and first part of\nthe play; an appreciation of its significance makes the connection with\nwhat follows less arbitrary and inorganic.\n\nWhen Beaumelle next appears, in the Third Act, there has been a change.\nWe may imagine that she has had time to ponder those cynical maxims\nof Bellapert on the natural course of romance. Her union has been\nunwilling; she does not care for her husband; Novall appeals to her as\nmuch as ever: with her eyes open, she deliberately chooses the path of\nsin--because the enforced marriage which shattered her hopes must needs\nappear to her the final demonstration of the correctness of her maid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncontention (towards which she was already inclining) that she has been\nfoolishly impractical to dream of the satisfaction of her heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish\nthrough wedlock, but that it is by secret amour that love must be, and\nis wont to be, enjoyed.\n\nIt may not be unreasonable to regard the resourcefulness and effrontery\nwhich characterize her throughout the Third Act as the result of a sort\nof mental intoxication, into which she has been lifted by her reckless\nresolve and the consciousness of danger; at any rate she now shows\nherself altogether too much for Romont; she finds a shrewdness and an\neloquence that carry her triumphant to the consummation of her desire.\nWhen discovery ensues, her paramour is slain, and she herself is haled\nto die, she is overcome--abruptly and, one might say, strangely--with\nremorse and penitence. But it is not at all by one of those\ntheatrically convenient but psychologically absurd changes of heart so\nfrequent in the drama of that period; nothing, indeed, could be more\ntrue to life. Novall Junior, coward and fop that he was, has hitherto\nalways borne himself in lordly fashion before her, even when they were\nsurprised by Romont; but now at last she beholds him stripped to the\nshivering abjectness of his contemptible soul, that she may observe\nhis baseness. She sees him cowed and beaten and slain, while Charalois\n(whom she never knew before their marriage nor has tried to understand\nin the brief period of their wedlock) with his outraged honor and\nirresistible prowess assumes to her eyes the proportions of a hero; and\nwith her girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s romanticism[10] of nature, she bows down and worships\nhim. It is somewhat the same note that is struck by Thackeray in the\nsimilar situation where Rawdon Crawley, returning home unexpectedly,\nfinds his wife with Lord Steyne and knocks the man down.\n\n_It was all done before Rebecca could interpose. She stood there\ntrembling before him. She admired her husband, strong, brave,\nvictorious._\n\nSo it was with Beaumelle. Except for one brief cry of \u00e2\u0080\u009cUndone for\never!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she utters no word from the moment of the surprise to the end\nof the Scene. She hangs back, shrinking, for a moment, when ordered\ninto the coach with the dead body of her partner in guilt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says\nCharalois, in terrible jest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have taught me to say, you must and\nshall.... You are but to keep him company you love--\u00e2\u0080\u009d and she obeys\nmutely.\n\nThus, all contriteness, Beaumelle goes to her fate. It should be\nobserved how, even at the last, her tendency to romantic idealization\nvehemently asserts itself; she looks fondly back (IV, iv, 53) to an\nimagined time, which never really existed, when she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ca\npart of\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charalois, made one with him through the virtuous harmony of\ntheir minds!--no voice is more unfaltering than her own to pronounce\nher doom as both righteous and necessary, and she conceives herself\nto climb, by her ecstatic welcoming of death, into the company of the\nancient heroines and martyrs. In its realism of the commonplace and its\nslightly ironic conception, it is the outline drawing of a character\nthat might have received elaborate portraiture at the hands of Flaubert.\n\nWhether we are to regard this consistent \u00e2\u0080\u009cstudy in little\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a\ndeliberate piece of work on the part of the authors, must remain a\nmatter of opinion. There is no similar figure elsewhere in the dramatic\noutput of Massinger, nor any quite so minutely conceived within the\nsame number of speech-lines in that of Field, and one could scarce\nbe blamed for believing that a number of hap-hazard, sketchy strokes\nwith which the collaborators dashed off a character whom they deemed\nof no great importance, all so fell upon the canvas that, by a miracle\nof chance, they went to form the lineaments of a real woman. The\ndiscussion of the probability or possibility of such a hypothesis would\ncarry us very far afield, and would involve the question of the extent\nto which all genius is unconscious and intuitive. But however that may\nbe, the _result_ of their labors remains the same, there to behold in\nblack and white, and Beaumelle, so far from being a poorly conceived\nand unsatisfactory wanton who is the chief defect of the play, is\na figure of no mean verisimilitude who succeeds after a fashion in\nlinking together the loose-knit dual structure of the drama; to whose\nmain catastrophe she adds her own tragedy, a tragedy neither impressive\nnor deeply stirring, it is true, for she is a petty spirit from whom\ngreat tragedy does not proceed--but tragedy still--the eternal,\ninevitable tragedy of false romanticism, that has found its culmination\nin the person of Emma Bovary.\n\nIn this study of Beaumelle, _The Fatal Dowry_ has been subjected to\na much more intensive examination than it is the custom to bestow\nupon the dramas of the successors of Shakespeare. The truth is that\nthe plays of the Jacobean period do not, as a rule, admit of such\nanalysis. In most of them, and especially in the plays of Massinger, he\nwho searches and probes them comes presently to a point beyond which\ncritical inquiry is stopped short with a desperate finality; be they\never so strikingly splendid and glittering fair in their poetry and\ntheir characterization, these dazzling qualities lie upon the surface,\nand a few careful perusals exhaust their possibilities and tell us all\nthere is to know of them. But _The Fatal Dowry_, though less imposing\nthan a number of others, stands almost alone among its contemporaries\nin sharing with the great creations of Shakespeare the power to open\nnew vistas, to present new aspects, to offer new suggestions, the\nlonger it is studied. Perhaps this is due to the fact that, as has\nalready been said, it is not so much a tragedy of the accepted type as\na cross-section of life.\n\nHow does it come about, we may well ask, that this play possesses\nqualities so rare and so strangely at variance with those which are\nnormal to the work of Massinger--its masterly portrait-gallery of\n_dramatis personae_ and its inexhaustible field for interpretation. We\ncan suspect an answer only in the complementary nature of the two minds\nthat went to fashion it--in the union in this one production of the\ntalents of Massinger and of Field.\n\nA reference to the analysis of collaboration discloses that, so far\nas the actual writing of the play goes, the figure of Novall Senior\nis altogether the work of Massinger. His son, on the other hand, is\nalmost entirely the work of Field; in Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share he appears only\nin the first part of III, i, and in the scene of his surprisal and\ndeath. Indeed, both the young gallant himself and all his satellites\ncan safely be put down as creations of the actor-dramatist. They have\ntheir parallels in his comedy of _Woman is a Weathercock_, down to the\npage whose pert _asides_ of satiric comment are anticipated in the\nearlier work by those of a youngster of identical kidney. The long\nscene in which we are introduced to Beaumelle and given insight into\nher character and mental attitude is Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throughout; thereafter she\nhas only to act out her already-revealed nature--first as the impudent\nadulteress and later as the repentant sinner, in both of which roles\nshe affords Massinger excellent opportunities to display his favorite\npowers of speech-making. Charalois, Romont, and Rochfort are treated at\nlength by both dramatists.\n\nBut in a harmonious collaboration, such as _The Fatal Dowry_ plainly\nwas, the contributions of the two authors cannot be identified with the\npassages from their respective pens. Each must inevitably have planned,\nsuggested, criticised. The question remains whether we can in any\nmeasure determine what part of the conception was due to each. Beyond\nthe Novall Junior group we cannot establish distinct lines of cleavage.\nWhat we can do is to suggest the features of the finished product which\nField and Massinger brought severally to its making--to point out the\nqualities of the two men which were joined to produce the play they\nhave given us.\n\nThe outstanding excellences of Massinger were a thorough grasp of the\narchitectonics of play-making in the building both of separate Act\nand entire drama; an adherence to an essential unity of design and\ntreatment; a conscientious regard to the details of stage-craft; a\nvehicle of dignified and at times noble verse, without violent conceits\nor lapses into triviality, sustained, lucid, regular; and a genuine\neloquence in forensic passages. His chief weaknesses were a certain\nstiffness of execution which made his plays appear always as structures\nrather than organisms, a ponderous monotony of fancy, and an inability\nto create or reproduce or understand human nature. His characters are\nnormally types, their qualities--honor, virtue, bravery, etc.--mere\nproperties which they can assume or lay aside at pleasure like\ngarments, their conduct governed more by the exigencies of plot than by\nany conceivable psychology.\n\nThe weaknesses of Field--as revealed in his two independent\ncomedies--were of a nature more evasive, less capable of definition. A\ntendency to weave too many threads into the action, an occasional hasty\nand skimping treatment of his scenes which leaves them unconvincing\nfor lack of sufficient elaboration, and a general thinness of design\nand workmanship are discoverable. Defects such as these could be\nreadily corrected by association with the single-minded, painstaking,\nthorough Massinger. On the other hand he possessed a lightness of\ntouch, a blithe vigor, and a racy, though often obscene, humor foreign\nto his colleague. What is more important, he possessed a considerable\nfirst-hand knowledge of men and women, and an ability to put them in\nhis plays and endow them with something of life--not to conceive great\nfigures, such as dominate the imagination, but to reproduce with\nvitality and freshness the sort of people he saw about him--in other\nwords, not to create but to depict; and furthermore Field seems to\nhave had a special gift for sketching them rather clearly in a very\nbrief compass.[11] Mr. Saintsbury was right in declaring that Massinger\nnever could draw a woman. But Field could, and the critic was rather\nunfortunate in applying his broadly correct observation to the one\nwoman of Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the delineation of whom he had Field to help\nhim!\n\nWith these facts in mind, the distinctive virtues of _The Fatal Dowry_\ncan be accounted for. Massinger here possessed a colleague who had\njust those talents of insight and verve and grasp of life that were\ndenied his own plodding, bookishly learned mind. Not only young Novall\nand his satellites, but Beaumelle certainly, and probably Pontalier\n(whom Massinger would have been more likely to degrade to the baseness\nof Novall\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other dependents) may be put down as essentially Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncreations, while in the case of the others he was ever at Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nelbow to guard him against blunders, if, indeed, their preliminary\nmapping out of the rather obvious lines along which the action and\ncharacters must develop were not of itself a sufficiently sure guide.\nTo Massinger, on the other hand, may safely be ascribed the basic\nconception of such stately figures as Charalois and Rochfort, however\nmuch Field may have been responsible for preserving them as fresh and\nliving portraits.\n\nAs to share in plot structure, in the absence of any known source,\nwe may conjecture that the germ from which the play evolved was the\nconception of that situation by which Charalois, burdened as he is with\nan immense debt of thankfulness to Rochfort, finds himself suddenly\ncalled by the imperative demands of honor to do that which will\nstrike his benefactor to the heart. The grounding of the hero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debt\nof gratitude in the story of Miltiades and Cimon was probably the work\nof Massinger, of whose veneration for things classic we have abundant\nevidence, while to him also, we may believe, was due the shaping of the\nstory in such fashion that he had opportunity to exploit his greatest\ngift in no less than two formal trials, one informal trial, and a\nlong Act besides given over almost exclusively to verbose disputes\nand exhortations. The circumstances of the discovery of the amour of\nBeaumelle and Novall, while penned by Massinger, are more likely an\ninvention of Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, not only as faintly reminiscent of his _Amends\nfor Ladies_, but as according better with the general spirit of his\nwork.\n\nSeveral plays of the Massinger _corpus_ are more striking on first\nacquaintance than _The Fatal Dowry_, and yet others surpass it in\nregard to this feature or that. It has not the gigantic protagonist\nof _A New Way to Pay Old Debts_, or the admirable structure of that\nfine play, which works with ever-cumulating intensity to one final,\ntremendous climax. It has not the impressiveness of _The Duke of\nMilan_, or its sheer sweep of tragic passion and breathless intensity,\nor anything so compelling as its great scene of gathering jealousy\nthat breaks forth at last in murder. Its verse is less poetic than\nthat of _The Maid of Honor_; it lacks the charm of _The Great Duke of\nFlorence_, and the ethical fervor of _The Roman Actor_. But in utter\nreality, in convincing simulation of life, which holds good under the\nmost exhaustive study and makes that study forever continue to yield\nnew suggestions and new appreciations, and in abundance and inherent\ntruthfulness of detailed characterization, it stands alone, and these\nsterling qualities must so outweigh its defects as to insure for it a\nhigh place, not only among the productions of its authors, but among\nthe plays of the Jacobean Period as a whole.\n\n\nSTAGE HISTORY--ADAPTATIONS--DERIVATIVES\n\nBeyond the statement on the title-page of the 1632 Quarto, that\n_The Fatal Dowry_ had been \u00e2\u0080\u009coften acted at the Private House in\nBlackfriars by his Majesties Servants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d nothing is known of its\nearly stage history. It was not revived after the Restoration, and\nuntil the publication of the Coxeter edition of Massinger seems to\nhave been almost unknown. At last, in 1825, an emended version was\nplaced upon the boards by no less an actor than the great Macready.\nJanuary 5 of that year was the date, and Drury Lane the place, of\nits initial performance, Macready himself taking the part of Romont,\nWallack--Charalois, Terry--Rochfort, and Mrs. W. West--Beaumelle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nplay was well acted and enthusiastically applauded,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Macready in\nhis _Reminiscences_ (p.\u00c2\u00a0228); \u00e2\u0080\u009cits repetition for the following Tuesday\nwas hailed most rapturously; but Friday[12] came, and with it a crowded\nhouse, to find me laboring under such indisposition that it was with\ndifficulty I could keep erect without support.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Macready\u00e2\u0080\u0099s serious\nillness cut short the run of the play, and when he was at length (April\n11) able to take it up again, the interest of the public had abated,\nand it in consequence was repeated only a few times--seven being the\ntotal number of its performances.\n\nThe variant of _The Fatal Dowry_ in which Macready acted was the work\nof Sheil, and involved substantial divergences. Romont\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release from\nprison follows immediately upon Novall Senior\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consent to his pardon,\nand in consequence, together with his conversation with Rochfort, is\ntransferred from Act II to the close of Act I, while the redemption of\nCharalois takes place at the funeral of his father, which concludes\nAct II. For the scene between Beaumelle and her maids is substituted\nanother coloquy of similar import but chastened tone. A brief scene\nof no especial significance is inserted at the beginning of Act III,\nin the interval between which and the preceding Act three weeks\nare supposed to have elapsed; the rest of Act III follows much the\nsame course as the original, save that the application of Romont to\nRochfort and his foiling by the stratagem of Beaumelle and Bellapert\nare omitted. A really notable departure is found in the discovery of\nthe amour by Charalois. According to Sheil, Novall Junior and his\nmistress attempt to elope, but the note which appoints their rendezvous\nfalls into Charalois\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hands, and he waits for the lovers and surprises\nthem, killing Novall off-stage. The Fifth Act opens with a scene of\na few lines only, in which Beaumont bears to Rochfort a request from\nCharalois to meet him in the church yard. Then follows a lugubrious\nscene in the dead of night beside the tomb of the hero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father,\nto which place are transferred the reconciliation between Charalois\nand Romont, and the judgment of Rochfort! Beaumelle, however, does\nnot appear during the trial, and upon the paternal sentence of doom,\nCharalois reveals her body, slain already by his hand. To the father\nhe vindicates his action in much the same words as in Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlast court-room scene, and then, on the appearance of Novall Senior\nclamoring for vengeance and accompanied by the minions of the law,\nstabs himself.\n\nThe version of Sheil follows with but occasional exceptions the\nlanguage of the original wherever possible. It makes some slight\nchanges in the minor characters.\n\nSheil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s redaction was also presented at Bath on February 18 and 21,\nRomont being acted by Hamblin, Charalois by Warde, Beaumelle by Miss E.\nTree. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHamblin never appeared to so much advantage--in the scene with\nNovall he reminded one strongly of John Kemble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Genest (_Hist.\nDra. and Stage in Eng._, IX, 322).\n\nAt Sadler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wells, Samuel Phelps, who at that time was reviving a\nnumber of the old dramas, took the stage in _The Fatal Dowry_ on August\n27, 1845. This, however, was Sheil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s version, and not the original\nplay of Massinger and Field, as has been sometimes supposed. It ranked\nas one of his four chief productions of that year. He, too, chose for\nhimself the part of Romont, which was considered by many his greatest\nquasi-tragic role. Marston appeared as Charalois, G. Bennett as\nRochfort, and Miss Cooper as Beaumelle.\n\n_The Fatal Dowry_ in substantially its own proper form does not appear\never to have been acted after Jacobean times.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf the stage career of _The Fatal Dowry_ has been meagre, not so the\nextent of its influence. Its literary parenthood begins before \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nclosing of the theatres\u00e2\u0080\u009d and continues even to our own day. As early as\n1638 it was echoed in _The Lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trial_ of Ford. Here the figures of\nAuria, Adurni, Aurelio, and Spinella correspond roughly with Charalois,\nyoung Novall, Romont, and Beaumelle respectively. Auria has gone\nto the wars, and in his absence his wife is pursued by Adurni, who\nsits at table with her in private, when Aurelio breaks in upon them,\nbursting open the doors. Spinella bitterly resents the intrusion and\nthe aspersions of the intruder, and when, on the return home of Auria,\nAurelio accuses her to him, it is without shaking his faith in her\nloyalty. Here the analogy ends: spite of Auria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredulousness there\nis no rupture between the friends; Spinella establishes her innocence;\nand Adurni, while guilty enough in his intent against her, shows\nhimself thereafter to be an essentially noble youth, who will defend\nto any length the lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honor which has become subject to question\nthrough fault of his, and for this gallant reparation, is not only\nforgiven, but even cherished ever after by the husband he had sought to\nwrong.\n\nThe more steadily one regards the man John Ford and his work, the more\nprobable does it appear that the relationship between _The Fatal Dowry_\nand _The Lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trial_ is not one of mere reminiscence or influence,\nbut of direct parentage. That strange and baleful figure, who seems\nalmost a modern Decadent born out of his time, had a profound interest\nin moral problems, to the study of which he brought morbid ethical\nsensibilities scarce matched before the latter nineteenth century.\n(Witness his conception, in _The Broken Heart_, of a loveless marriage\nas tantamount to adultery.) Ford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talent for invention was deficient\nto the extent that he was hard put to it for plots. It is not at all\nunlikely that he surveyed the Massingerian tragedy, and, repelled by\nthe conduct of its figures, exclaimed to himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will write a play\nto centre around a situation as incriminating as that of Act III of\n_The Fatal Dowry_; but my personages will be worthier characters; I\nwill show a lady who, spite of appearances, is of stainless innocence\nand vindicates her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trust in the face of evidence; I will show\na friendship strong enough to endure an honestly mistaken aspersion put\nupon the chastity of a wife, though the charge is not for one moment\ncredited; I will show that even the would-be seducer may be a fine\nfellow at bottom, and set forth a generous emulation in magnanimity\nbetween him and the husband. See how finely everything would work out\nwith the _right_ sort of people!\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is at least a plausible hypothesis.\n\nNicholas Rowe, who was the first modern editor of Shakespeare,\ncontemplated also an edition of Massinger, but gave up the project that\nhe might more safely plunder one of his plays. Rowe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famous tragedy,\n_The Fair Penitent_, was deliberately stolen from _The Fatal Dowry_.\nIt appeared in 1703, and spite of a ludicrous accident[13] which cut\nshort its first run, took rank as one of the most celebrated dramas of\nthe English stage. Rowe lived during the vogue of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe-tragedy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwhile the canons of literary criticism of his day demanded a \u00e2\u0080\u009cregular,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\npseudo-classical form and a sententious tone. Accordingly, in his hands\nthe chief figure in the play, as is evidenced by the change in title,\nbecomes the guilty wife, here called Calista, who is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow the evil\nqueen of the heroic plays; now the lachrymose moralizer;\u00e2\u0080\u009d the theme is\nindeed _her_ story, not Altamont\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (Charalois)--her seduction (prior\nto the nuptuals and before the opening of the play), her grief, her\nplight, her exposure, her death;--she holds the centre of the stage\nto the very end. The number of the _dramatis personae_ is cut down\nto eight; all touches of comedy are excised; and the double plot of\nthe original is unified by the bold stroke of throwing back to a time\nbefore the opening of the play the entire episode of the unburied\ncorpse and the origin of the hero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friendship with the father of the\nheroine.\n\nDiscussions of the relative merits of _The Fair Penitent_ and its\nsource have been almost invariably acrimonious. Nor is this to be\nwondered at, for after reading the old tragedy with its severe\ndignity and noble restraint, one can scarce peruse without irritation\nthe cloyingly melifluous, emasculated verse of Rowe--by turns\ngrandiloquent and sentimental. The characterization of _The Fair\nPenitent_ is, in the main, insipid, and while Rowe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heroine holds a\ncommanding place in her drama to which Beaumelle does not pretend, the\nlatter is a great deal more natural, and indeed, for that matter, far\nmore truly a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpenitent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An exception to the general insipidity is\nLothario, who is the analogue of the insignificant Novall Junior--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\ngay Lothario\u00e2\u0080\u009d--whose very name has been ever since a synonym for\nthe graceful, graceless, devil-may-care libertine--whose figure has\nbeen the prototype of a long line of similar characters in English\nliterature, beginning with Richardson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lovelace and not yet closed\nwith Anthony Hope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rupert of Hentzau. Beside this striking creation,\nthe seducer of Beaumelle shows poorly indeed; but it is doubtful if the\nold dramatists would have consented to paint such an attractive rogue,\nhad they been able; they wanted their Novall to be just the cowardly,\ndandyfied thing they made him. Beyond the portrait of Lothario, small\nground for praise can be found in _The Fair Penitent_. That part of the\naction of _The Fatal Dowry_ which under Rowe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treatment antedates the\nrise of the curtain is narrated in the most stiffly mechanical sort\nof exposition; the action is developed by such threadbare theatrical\ndevices as a lost letter and an overheard conversation; the voluble\nspeeches of the several characters are, throughout, declamatory\neffusions almost unbelievably divorced from the apposite utterance of\nany rational human being under the circumstances. An Altamont who has\nbeen assured and reassured from his bride\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own lips of her aversion\nfor him can fling himself from a quarrel with his life-long friend in\nhysterical defence of her, to seek solace in her arms--\n\n  _There if in any pause of love I rest\n  Breathless with bliss upon her panting breast,\n  In broken, melting accents I will swear,\n  Henceforth to trust my heart with none save her;_\n\na Sciolto who has given his daughter a dagger with which to end her\nshame, and then has arrested her willing arm with the prayer that she\nwill not dispatch herself until he is gone from the sight of her, can\nthereupon take leave of her with the statement:\n\n  _There is I know not what of sad presage\n  That tells me I shall never see thee more._\n\nThe play, which enjoyed an immense fame, high contemporary\nappreciation, and a long career on the stage, remains a curious\nmemorial of the taste of a bygone day.\n\nIt is noteworthy that in _The Fair Penitent_ Horatio, as Romont in\nall modern reproductions of _The Fatal Dowry_, is the great acting\npart--not the husband.\n\nIn 1758 was produced at the Hay market a drama entitled _The Insolvent\nor Filial Piety_, from the pen of Aaron Hill. In the preface it is\nsaid--according to Genest (IV, 538)--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWilks about 30 years before gave\nan old manuscript play, called the _Guiltless Adulteress_, to Theo.\nCibber who was manager of what then was the Summer Company--after an\ninterval of several years this play was judged to want a revisal to\nfit it for representation--Aaron Hill at the request of Theo. Cibber\nalmost new wrote the whole, and the last act was entirely his in\nconduct, sentiment and diction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In reality, _The Insolvent_ is _The\nFatal Dowry_ over again, altered to tragicomedy, and with the names of\nthe characters changed. The first two Acts of Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s play proceed much\nafter the manner of its prototype, with close parallels in language.\nFrom thenceforward, however, the action diverges. The bride, Amelia,\nresists the further attentions of her former sweetheart. They are none\nthe less observed and suspected by her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend, who speaks\nof the matter to both her father and her lord. The former promises\nto observe her with watchful eye; Chalons, the husband, is at first\nresentful of the imputation, but presently yields to his friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nadvice, that he pretend a two-days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journey, from which he will return\nunexpectedly. During his absence, his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maid introduces the lover\ninto her mistress\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chamber while Amelia sleeps. There Chalons surprises\nhim kneeling beside the bed, and kills him. Amelia stabs herself, but\nthe confession of her maid reveals her innocence, and her wound is\npronounced not mortal.\n\nIt has been suggested (_Biographia Dramatica_, II, 228--quoted by\nPhelan, p.\u00c2\u00a059, and Schwarz, p.\u00c2\u00a074) that in Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Zara_ (adaptation\nof the _Zaire_ of Voltaire), also, Nerestan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voluntary return to\ncaptivity in order to end that of his friends, whom he lacked the means\nto ransom with gold, was suggested by the behavior of Charalois; but\nthis can be no more than a coincidence, as it here but reproduces what\nis in the French original.\n\nA long interval, and finally, in the dawn of the twentieth century,\nthere appeared the next and latest recrudescence of _The Fatal\nDowry_. This was _Der Graf von Charolais, ein Trauerspiel_, by\nRichard Beer-Hofmann, disciple of the Neo-Romantic School or\n_Vienna Decadents_, a coterie built about the leadership of Hugo\nvon Hofmannsthal. Beer-Hofmann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s play--a five-Act tragedy in blank\nverse--was produced for the first time at the Neue Theatre, Berlin, on\nDecember 24, 1904, and was received with considerable acclaim. Unlike\nRowe, he gives full credit to his source, from which he has drawn no\nless extensively than the author of _The Fair Penitent_. Unlike Rowe,\nhe goes back to the old dramatists in the matter of construction,\nplacing upon the stage once more the episode of the unburied corpse\nand the noble son; he even outdoes _The Fatal Dowry_ in this respect,\nby allowing the first half of his plot three Acts instead of two, with\nonly two Acts for the amour and its tragic consequences. In his hands\nthe hero again becomes the central figure; in fact, the three principal\nversions of this _donnee_ suggest by their titles their respective\nviewpoints: _The Fatal Dowry_; _The Fair Penitent_; _Der Graf von\nCharolais_. DER GRAF VON CHAROLAIS, be it observed;--this new redaction\nis no longer the tale of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfatal dowry;\u00e2\u0080\u009d no longer is the first part\nof the dual theme merely introductory and accessory--it is co\u00c3\u00b6rdinate\nwith the second. Beer-Hofmann has sought to achieve a kind of unity\nfrom his double plot by making his fundamental theme not the adulterous\nintrigue, but _the destiny of Charolais_, thus converting the play\ninto a Tragedy of Fate, which pursues the hero inexorably through all\nhis life. This strictly classical _motif_ animating the _donnee_ of a\nJacobean play reproduced in the twentieth century presents, as might\nbe expected, the aspect of an exotic growth, which is not lessened by\nthe extreme sensuousness of treatment throughout, such as has always\nbeen one of the cardinal and distinctive qualities of the Decadent\nSchool the world over. But as a contrast in the dramatic technique\nand verse of Jacobean and modern times, _Der Graf von Charolais_ is\nextremely interesting. The difference is striking between the severe\nsimplicity of three centuries ago, and the elaborate stagecraft of\nto-day, its insistence on detail, and studied care in the portraiture\nof minor characters. Yet minutia do not make tragedy, and while their\nsuperficial realism and the congeniality of the contemporary point of\nview undeniably lend to Beer-Hofmann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s redaction a palatability and a\npower to interest and appeal which its original does not possess to\nthe modern reader, yet a discriminating critic will turn back to the\nold play with a feeling that, for all its stiffness and conventions,\nhe breathes there a more vital air. To the enrichment of his theme\nBeer-Hofmann contributes every ingenious effect possible to symbolism,\ndelicate suggestion, and scenic device; this exterior decoration is\ngorgeous in its color and seductive warmth, but no amount of such stuff\ncan compensate for the fundamental flaw in the crucial episode of\nhis tragedy. In spite of the care which he has lavished on the scene\nbetween his heroine and her seducer, the surrender of the wife--three\nyears married, a mother, and loving both husband and child--remains\ninsufficiently motivated and sheerly inexplicable, and by this vital,\ninherent defect the play must fall. Moreover, it lacks a hero. Romont\ncan no longer play the main part he did in former versions; he is\nreduced to a mere shadow. In a tragedy of Fate, which blights a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncareer, phase by phase, with persistent, relentless hand, that man\nmust necessarily be the central figure, and, of right, _should_ be an\nimposing figure--a protagonist at once gigantic and appealing, who will\ndraw all hearts to him in pity and terror at the helpless, hopeless\nstruggle of over-matched greatness and worth; whereas Charolais--\n\nThe case of Charolais is peculiar. _A priori_ we should expect him\nto be just such a personage, yet his conduct throughout is best\nexplainable as that of a man dominated, not by noble impulses,\nbut by an extreme egoism--a man acutely responsive alike to his\nsense-impressions and his feverish imagination, and possessed of an\nexaggerated squeamishness towards the ugly and the unpleasant. When,\nin the First Act, he bursts into tears, he confesses it is not for his\nfather that he weeps, but for his own hard lot; he suffers from his\nrepugnance to the idea of his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corpse rotting above ground--a\nrepugnance so intolerable to him that he will yield his liberty to\nescape it. He purposes to cashier the innkeeper because the sight of\nthe lecherous patrons of his hostelry has disgusted him, and he alters\nhis resolve and forgives the fellow, not from any considerations of\nmercy, but because the mental picture of the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distress tortures\nhim. And by similar personal repugnances reacting on egoism is his\nbehavior in the denouement to be accounted for, and in this light\nbecomes logically credible and clearly understood. Few practices are\nmore hazardous or unjust than judging an artist by his objective\ncreations; but an ignoble protagonist, as Charolais is represented,\nis in such ill accord with any conceivable purpose on the part of\nBeer-Hofmann, and so unlikely to have been intended by him, that one\ncannot help strongly suspecting that the author unconsciously projected\nhimself into the character and thus revealed his own nature and point\nof view. In any case he has presented for his hero a whimperer who can\ncommand neither our sympathy nor our respect when he cries above the\nbodies of his benefactor and her who is that benefactor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, his\nown wife, and the mother of his child:\n\n  _Ist dies St\u00c3\u00bcck denn aus,\n  Weil jene starb? Und ich? An mich denkt keiner?_\n\nWe have come a long way from Massinger and Field and the early\nseventeenth century. The shadow of the old dramatists reaches far,\neven to our own time; we have seen their play redeveloped, but never\nimproved upon, by pseudo-classicist, and popularizer, and Decadent\nhyper-aesthete. That which was the vulnerable point in the original\nproduction--its two-fold plot--has been still for every imitator a\nstone of stumbling. Rowe tried to escape it by the suppression of the\nantecedent half, and the fraction which remained in his hand was an\nartificial thing without the breath of life, that had to be attenuated\nand padded out with speechifying to fill the compass of its five Acts.\nBeer-Hofmann tried to escape it by superimposing an idea not proper\nto the story, and beneath the weight of this his tragedy collapsed in\nthe middle, for its addition over-packed the drama, and left him not\nroom enough to make convincing the conduct of his characters. The first\nessayers, who attacked in straightforward fashion their unwieldy theme,\nsucceeded best; all attempts to obviate its essential defect have\nmarred rather than mended. Perhaps the theme is by its nature unsuited\nto dramatic treatment, and yet there is much that is dramatic about\nthat theme, as is evinced by the fact that playwrights have been unable\nto let it lie.\n\n\n\n\nEDITOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099S NOTE ON TEXT\n\n\nThe present text aims to reproduce exactly the Quarto edition of 1632,\nretaining its punctuation, spelling, capitals, italics, and stage\ndirections--amending only the metrical alignment.[14] Mere mistakes\nof printing--inverted and broken letters--are restored, but are duly\ncatalogued in the foot notes. The division into scenes, as made by\nGifford, and his affixment of the _locus_ of each, are inserted into\nthe text, inclosed in brackets. In the foot notes are recorded all\nvariants of all subsequent editions. Differences of punctuation are\ngiven, if they could possibly alter the meaning, but not otherwise--nor\nmere differences _in wording_ of stage directions, nor differences in\nspelling, nor elision for metre. In the Quarto the elder Novall is\nsometimes designated before his lines as _Novall Senior_, sometimes\nmerely as _Novall_--no confusion is possible, since he and his son are\nnever on the stage at the same time. Gifford and Symons always write\n_Novall Senior_, while Coxeter and Mason write _Novall_ alone in I, i,\nand _Novall Senior_ thereafter. I have not thought it worth while to\nnote the variants of the several texts on this point.\n\n\n\n\n    Q.--The Quarto--1632\n\n    C.--Coxeter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edition, 1759\n\n    M.--Monck Mason\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edition, 1779\n\n    G.--Gifford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s [2nd.] edition, 1813\n\n    S.--Symons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Mermaid) edition, 1893\n\n    f.--and all later editions\n\n  s.d.--stage direction\n\n\n\n\n  THE FATALL DOWRY:\n\n  A TRAGEDY:\n\n  _As it hath beene often Acted at the Priuate\n  House in Blackefryers, by his\n  Maiesties Seruants._\n\n  _Written by P.\u00c2\u00a0M. and N.\u00c2\u00a0F._\n\n\n  LONDON,\n\n  Printed by IOHN NORTON, for FRANCIS\n  CONSTABLE, and are to be iold at his\n  shop at the _Crane_, in _Pauls Churchyard_.\n  1632.\n\n\n\n\n  _Charalois._\n\n  _Romont._\n\n  _Charmi._\n\n  _Nouall Sen._\n\n  _Liladam._\n\n  _DuCroy._\n\n  _Rochfort._\n\n  _Baumont._\n\n  _Pontalier._\n\n  _Malotin._\n\n  _Beaumelle._\n\n  _Florimel._ }\n\n  _Bellapert._}\n\n  _Aymer._\n\n  _Nouall Jun._\n\n  _Aduocates._\n\n  _Creditors 3._\n\n  _Officers._\n\n  _Priest._\n\n  _Taylor._\n\n  _Barber._\n\n  _Perfumer._\n\n  [Page.]\n\n  [Presidents, Captains, Soldiers, Mourners, Gaoler, Bailiffs,\n  Servants.]\n\n\n\n\nThe Fatall Dowry:\n\nA Tragedy:\n\n\n\n\n_Act. primus._\n\n\n_Scaena prima:_\n\n[_A Street before the Court of Justice_]\n\n_Enter_ Charaloyes _with a paper_, Romont, Charmi.\n\n  _Charmi_ Sir, I may moue the Court to serue your will,\n  But therein shall both wrong you and my selfe.\n\n  _Rom._ Why thinke you so sir?\n\n  _Charmi._                    \u00e2\u0080\u0099Cause I am familiar\n  With what will be their answere: they will say,\n  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis against law, and argue me of Ignorance                          5\n  For offering them the motion.\n\n  _Rom._                       You know not, Sir,\n  How in this cause they may dispence with Law,\n  And therefore frame not you their answere for them,\n  But doe your parts.\n\n  _Charmi._          I loue the cause so well,\n  As I could runne, the hazard of a checke for \u00e2\u0080\u0099t.                    10\n\n  _Rom._ From whom?\n\n  _Charmi._        Some of the bench, that watch to give it,\n  More then to doe the office that they fit for:\n  But giue me (sir) my fee.\n\n  _Rom._                   Now you are Noble.\n\n  _Charmi._ I shall deserue this better yet, in giuing\n  My Lord some counsell, (if he please to heare it)                   15\n  Then I shall doe with pleading.\n\n  _Rom._                         What may it be, sir?\n\n  _Charmi._ That it would please his Lordship, as the presidents,\n  And Counsaylors of Court come by, to stand\n  Heere, and but shew your selfe, and to some one\n  Or two, make his request: there is a minute                         20\n  When a mans presence speakes in his owne cause,\n  More then the tongues of twenty aduocates.\n\n  _Rom._ I haue vrg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d that.\n\n    _Enter_ Rochfort: _DuCroye_.\n\n  _Charmi._                Their Lordships here are coming,\n  I must goe get me a place, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099l finde me in Court,\n  And at your seruice\n\n    _Exit Charmi._\n\n  _Rom._             Now put on your Spirits.                         25\n\n  _Du Croy._ The ease that you prepare your selfe, my Lord,\n  In giuing vp the place you hold in Court,\n  Will proue (I feare) a trouble in the State,\n  And that no slight one.\n\n  _Roch._                Pray you sir, no more.\n\n  _Rom._ Now sir, lose not this offerd means: their lookes            30\n  Fixt on you, with a pittying earnestnesse,\n  Inuite you to demand their furtherance\n  To your good purpose.--This such a dulnesse\n  So foolish and vntimely as--\n\n  _Du Croy._                  You know him.\n\n  _Roch._ I doe, and much lament the sudden fall                      35\n  Of his braue house.

This domain had been purchased by Philip the Bold for his\nson, John the Fearless.\n\nI, i, 4. _argue me of_--obsolete construction: \u00e2\u0080\u009caccuse me of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cf. Ray,\n_Disc._ II, v, 213: \u00e2\u0080\u009cErroneously argues Hubert Thomas ... of a mistake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI, i, 7. _dispence with_--give special exemption from. Cf. I, ii, 87.\n\nI, i, 33. _This such_--_This_ for _this is_ is a common Elizabethan\nconstruction. Cf. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO this the poison of deep grief\u00e2\u0080\u009d--_Hamlet_, IV, v,\n76; \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis a good block\u00e2\u0080\u009d--_Lear_, IV, vi, 187.\n\nI, i, 45. _tooke vp_--borrowed. Cf. Shakespeare, _Henry IV, Part II_,\nI, ii, 46: \u00e2\u0080\u009cif a man is through with them in honest taking up, they\nstand upon security.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI, i, 55-6. _Your sable habit, with the hat and cloak ... haue\npower_--the details of hat, cloak, and ribbons, interposed between\nsubject and verb, have attracted the latter into the plural, to the\nviolation of its agreement with its substantive.\n\nI, i, 70. _in that_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., in the fact that justice had no such guards.\n\nI, i, 73-7. For the allusion to _Cerberus_ and the _sops_, cf. Virgil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npicture of Aeneas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journey to Hades (Aeneid, VI, 417-425): \u00e2\u0080\u009cHuge\nCerberus makes these realms to resound with barking from his tripple\njaws, stretched at his enormous length in a den that fronts the gate.\nTo whom the prophetess, seeing his neck now bristle with horrid snakes,\nflings a soporific cake of honey and medicated grain. He, in the mad\nrage of hunger, opening his three mouths, snatches the offered morsel,\nand, spread on the ground, relaxes his monstrous limbs, and is extended\nat vast length over all the cave. Aeneas, now that the keeper [of Hell]\nis buried [in sleep], seizes the passage and swift overpasses the bank\nof that flood whence there is no return.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--_Davidson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trans._\n\nI, i, 75. _fertyle headed--many headed_, _fertyle_ is used in the now\nobsolete sense of _abundant_.\n\nI, i, 92. _such, whose_--for the construction, cf. Shakespeare: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch I\nwill have, whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--_All\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Well_,\nIII, iv, 24.\n\nI, i, 99. _men religious_--the adjective is regularly placed after its\nnoun in Eliz. Eng. when the substantive is unemphatic and the modifier\nnot a mere epithet, but essential to the sense. See Abbott, S.\u00c2\u00a0G. \u00c2\u00a7 419.\n\nI, i, 137-8.--The thought of these lines is undeveloped, the phrasing\nbeing broken and disconnected. It is a scornful observation on the\npart of Romont that whether or not Novall takes papers depends on how\nthe matter is brought before him--and he is about to add that there is\na way in which Charalois can manage to gain his point, when he breaks\noff with the cry, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d _Conuayance_ = contrivance.\n\nI, i, 164. _parchment toils_--snares in the shape of documents upon\nparchment, such as bonds, mortgages, etc.\n\nI, i, 166. _Luxury_--used here in the modern sense,--not, as more\ncommonly in Elizabethan times, with the meaning, _laciviousness_,\n_lust_. The thought of the somewhat involved period which ends with\nthis line is, that the creditors prayed only on an occasion when they\nfeared to lose their clutch on some rich spendthrift--on which occasion\nthey would pray to the devil to invent some new and fantastic pleasure\nwhich would lure their victim back into the toils.\n\nI, ii, 11. _Dijon_--the scene of the drama,--situated on the western\nborder of the fertile plain of Burgundy, and at the confluence of the\nOuche and the Suzon. It was formerly the capital of the province of\nBurgundy, the dukes of which acquired it early in the eleventh century,\nand took up their residence there in the thirteenth century. For the\ndecoration of the palace and other monuments built by them, eminent\nartists were gathered from northern France and Flanders, and during\nthis period the town became one of the great intellectual centers of\nFrance. The union of the duchy with the crown in 1477 deprived Dijon\nof the splendor of the ducal court, but to counterbalance this loss it\nwas made the capital of the province and the seat of a _parlement_.\nTo-day it possesses a population of some 65,000, and is a place of\nconsiderable importance.\n\nI, ii, 21-3. _Nor now ... that I vndertooke, forsake it._--The\nexpression is elliptical, the verb of the preceding period being in\nthe future indicative--whereas here the incomplete verb is in the\nconditional mood. In full: _Nor now ... that I undertook, would I\nforsake it._\n\nI, ii, 56. _determine of--of_ is the preposition in obs. usage which\nfollows _determine_ used, as here, in the sense of _decide_, _come to a\njudicial decision_, _come to a decision on_ (_upon_). Cf. IV, iv, 82.\n\nI, ii, 57. _to_--in addition to.\n\nI, ii, 66. _become_--modern editors, beginning with Mason, read\n_became_; but _become_ may be taken as a variant form of the past\ntense (or even as participle for _having become_, with nom. absolute\nconstruction, though this is less likely).\n\nI, ii, 91-2. _May force you ... plead at_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e. \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay cause your\ndismissal from the bar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI, ii, 107. _purple-colour\u00e2\u0080\u0099d_--Novall wears the official red robe of\njudge.\n\nI, ii, 123-4. _the subtill Fox of France, The politique Lewis_--Louis\nXI of France, an old enemy of Burgundy.\n\nI, ii, 127. _If that_, etc.--Gradually, as the interrogatives were\nrecognized as relatives, the force of _that_, _so_, _as_, in \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen\n_that_\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen _so_\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen _as_\u00e2\u0080\u009d, seems to have tended to make the\nrelative more general and indefinite; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho so\u00e2\u0080\u009d being now nearly (and\nonce quite) as indefinite as \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhosoever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d... In this sense, by analogy,\n_that_ was attached to other words, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cif\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy\u00e2\u0080\u009d,\netc.--Abbott, S.\u00c2\u00a0G. \u00c2\u00a7 287.\n\nCf.\n\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that rebellion\n  Came like itself, in base and abject routs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n      _Henry IV, Part_ II, IV, i, 32.\n\nThe same construction appears in V, iii, 95.\n\nI, ii, 163. _Writ man_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., wrote himself down as a man.\n\nI, ii, 170. _Granson_, _Morat_, _Nancy_--the \u00e2\u0080\u009cthree memorable\noverthrows\u00e2\u0080\u009d which Charles the Bold suffered at the hands of the Swiss\ncantons and Duke Ren\u00c3\u00a9 of Loraine. The battle of Granson took place\nMarch 3, 1476; that of Morat, June 22, 1476; that of Nancy, January\n5, 1477. On each occasion the army of Charles was annihilated; and\nfinally at Nancy he was himself slain. These defeats ended the power of\nBurgundy.\n\nI, ii, 171. _The warlike Charloyes_--Charles the Bold, the Duke of\nBurgundy.\n\nI, ii, 185. _Ill ayres_--noxious exhalations, miasma.\n\nI, ii, 194-5. _They are onely good men, that pay what they owe._\n\n  2 Cred. _And so they are._\n\n  1 Cred.                  _\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the City Doctrine._\n\nCf. Shakespeare in _The Merchant of Venice_, I, iii, 12 ff.:\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Shy._ Antonio is a good man.\n\n  _Bass._ Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?\n\n  _Shy._ Ho, no, no, no, no! My meaning in saying he is a good man is\n  to have you understand me that he is sufficient.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI, ii, 201. _right_--so in all texts. With this word the meaning is\nperfectly plain, but the substitution, in its place, of _weight_ would\nbetter sustain the figure used in the preceding line. _Weight_ is a\nword which it is not unlikely the printer would mis-read from the Ms.\nas _right_.\n\nI, ii, 207. _in your danger_--regularly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin your power\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat your\nmercy\u00e2\u0080\u009d; so here, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin your debt\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nI, ii, 245. _As_--used here in its demonstrative meaning, to introduce\na parenthetical clause. Cf. Abbott, S.\u00c2\u00a0G. \u00c2\u00a7 110.\n\nII, i, 13. _sits_--the common Elizabethan 3rd. person plural in _s_,\ngenerally and without warrant altered by modern editors. See Abbott,\nS.\u00c2\u00a0G. \u00c2\u00a7 333. Cf. _keepes_, V, ii, 37.\n\nII, i, 28. _was--monies_ is taken in the collective sense.\n\nII, i, 46. _interd a liuely graue_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., _enter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d a lively_\n[_living_] _grave_. G., who first prints it so, considers he has made a\nchange in the first word, taking it in the Q. for _interr\u00e2\u0080\u0099d_, as does\nM., who suggests in a footnote the reading: _enters alive the grave_.\nBut _interd_ may be, and is best, taken as merely an old spelling for\n_enter\u00e2\u0080\u0099d_, naturally attracted to the _i_-form by the presence of the\nword _interment_ in the preceding line.\n\nII, i, 63. _Remember best, forget not gratitude_--ellipsis for:\n_Remember best who forget not gratitude_. Modern usage confines the\nomission of the relative mostly to the objective. In Eliz. Eng.,\nhowever, the nominative relative was even more frequently omitted,\nespecially when the antecedent clause was emphatic and evidently\nincomplete, and where the antecedent immediately preceded the verb to\nwhich the relative would be subject. See Abbott, S.\u00c2\u00a0G., \u00c2\u00a7 244.\n\nCf. III, i, 134-5; i, 139; i, 332; IV, ii, 61.\n\nII, i, 65. _viperous_--according to various classical authorities\n[e.\u00c2\u00a0g., Pliny, X, 82], the young of vipers eat their way forth to light\nthrough the bowels of their dam. The figure here seems to be somewhat\nconfused, as the dead hero is the _son_ of the country, his mother,\nwho devours _him_. The thought, perhaps, in the mind of the dramatist,\nalbeit ill-expressed, was that the mother-country owed her existence to\nher son, and, viper-like had devoured the author of her life.\n\nII, i, 66. _eate_--owing to the tendency to drop the inflectional\nending _-en_, the Elizabethans frequently used the curtailed forms of\npast participles, which are common in Early English: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have spoke,\nforgot, writ, chid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc.--Abbott, S.\u00c2\u00a0G., \u00c2\u00a7 343. Cf. _broke_, II, ii,\n27; _spoke_, III, i, 3; _begot_, IV, iv, 154; 170.\n\nII, i, 83. _golden calf_--the figure, from its immediate application\nto _a dolt of great wealth_, is transferred to the false god whom the\nchildren of Israel worshipped at the foot of Mount Sina\u00c3\u00af.\n\nII, i, 93-4. _Would they not so_, etc.--the Q. reading is to be\npreferred to either of the modern emendations. It is probably in the\nsense of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould they no more but so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, with the ensuing declaration\nthat in that case they would keep their tears to stop (fill?) bottles\n(probably meaning lachrimatories or phials used in ancient times for\nthe preservation of tears of mourning).\n\nII, i, 98-9. _Y\u00e2\u0080\u0099are ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099re content, Crying nor laughing_--The meaning\nis, of course: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are never content with us, whether we are crying or\nlaughing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nII, i, 100. _Both with a birth_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., both together, at the same time.\n\nII, i, 137. _Burmudas_--The Bermuda islands, known only through the\ntales of early navigators who suffered shipwreck there, enjoyed a\nmost unsavory reputation in Elizabethan times, as being the seat of\ncontinual tempests, and the surrounding waters \u00e2\u0080\u009ca hellish sea for\nthunder, lightning, and storms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cf. Shakespeare, _The Tempest_, I, ii,\n269: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe still-vexed Bermoothes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They were said to be enchanted, and\ninhabited by witches and devils. They were made famous by the shipwreck\nthere in 1609 of Sir George Somers; the following year one of his\nparty, Sil. Jordan, published _A Discovery of the Bermudas, otherwise\ncalled the Isle of Devils_.\n\nField has another reference to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Barmuthoes\u00e2\u0080\u009d in _Amends for Ladies_,\nIII, iv; but there it is not clear whether he means the islands or\ncertain narrow passages north of Covent Garden, which went by the slang\nname of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Bermudas\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Streights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It _is_ in this latter sense\nthat the word is used in Jonson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _The Devil is an Ass_, II, i.\n\nII, i, 139. _Exact the strictnesse_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., require a strict\nenforcement of the sentence which limits Charalois to the confines of\nthe prison.\n\nII, i, 144. _vsurers relief_, etc.--a rather awkward expression, so\nphrased for the sake of the end-scene rhyme. The thought seems to be:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe relief which usurers have to offer mourns, if the debtors have\n(exhibit) too much grief.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charalois\u00e2\u0080\u0099 remark is, of course, ironical.\n\nII, ii, 10. _electuary_--a medicinal conserve or paste, consisting of\na powder or some other ingredient mixed with honey, preserve, or syrup\nof some other kind. Beaumelle means that Florimal is the medicine and\nBellapert the sweet which makes it palatable.\n\nII, ii, 17. _serue_--G. and S. read _served_, which is certainly\ncorrect. Not only is there nothing throughout the play to suggest that\nBeaumelle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother is still alive, but she herself has just spoken of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou two my women\u00e2\u0080\u009d (l.\u00c2\u00a011).\n\nII, ii, 18. _a peepe out_--a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpip\u00e2\u0080\u009d [old spelling _peepe_] is one of the\nspots on playing cards, dice, or dominoes. The allusion is to a game of\ncards called \u00e2\u0080\u009cone-and-thirty\u00e2\u0080\u009d; thirty-two is a pip too many.\n\nII, ii, 21-2. _the mother of the maydes_--a title properly applied to\nthe head of the maids of honour in a Royal household.\n\nII, ii, 22. _mortifie_--there is a significant ambiguity to the word\nBellapert uses. It means \u00e2\u0080\u009cbring into subjection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009crender dead to the\nworld and the flesh;\u00e2\u0080\u009d it formerly had also a baleful meaning: \u00e2\u0080\u009cto\nkill;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cto destroy the vitality, vigor, or activity of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nII, ii, 32. _vanuable, to make you thus--valuable_ is used in its\ngeneric sense of _value-able_, _of sufficient value_.\n\nII, ii, 71. _turn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in her varieties_--G., S. read: _trimm\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in her\nvarieties_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cdecked in her varieties [varied aspects].\u00e2\u0080\u009d But\nadherence to the Q. is possible, with the meaning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfashioned in her\nvarieties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nII, ii, 82. _walkes not vnder a weede_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cwears not a garment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cis not in existence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nII, ii, 88. _Tissue_--a rich kind of cloth, often interwoven with gold\nor silver. So again in II, ii, 175.\n\nII, ii, 89. _a three-leg\u00e2\u0080\u0099d lord_--the meaning is that Young Novall\ncannot independently \u00e2\u0080\u009cstand upon his own legs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but requires the triple\nsupport of himself, Liladam, and Aymer.\n\nII, ii, 96. _musicke house_--a public hall or saloon for musical\nperformances.\n\nII, ii, 99-100. _in the Galley foyst_, etc.--a Galley-foist was a state\nbarge, especially that of the Lord Mayor of London. This, however, can\nhardly be the meaning of the word here, used as it is in connection\nwith _Bullion_, which were trunk-hose, puffed out at the upper part,\nin several folds; and with _Quirpo_, a variant of _cuerpo_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., _in\nundress_. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGalley-foist\u00e2\u0080\u009d may be the name of some dress of the period,\nso-called for its resemblance to the gaily bedecked Mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-barge. But\nit is not unlikely, as Mason suggests, that _The Galley-foist_ and _The\nBullion_ were the names of taverns of that day; or else of houses of\npublic resort for some kind of amusement.\n\nII, ii, 104. _skip_--so in all texts. But Field has elsewhere (_Woman\nis a Weathercock_, II, i.): \u00e2\u0080\u009cand then my lord ... casts a suit every\nquarter, which I _slip_ into.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is probable that the word was the\nsame in both passages,--though whether _skip_ or _slip_ I have no means\nof determining.\n\nII, ii, 119. _St Omers_--more properly, _St. Omer_, a town of northern\nFrance. A College of Jesuits was located there, and the point of\nNovall\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comparison is perhaps an allusion to the mean appearance of\nJesuit spies who would come from thence to England on some pretext,\nsuch as to see their friends during the Christmas season.\n\nII, ii, 122. _ly\u00e2\u0080\u0099n perdieu_--\u00e2\u0080\u009cto lie perdu\u00e2\u0080\u009d is properly a military\nterm for, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be placed as a sentinel or outpost,\u00e2\u0080\u009d especially in an\nexposed position. _Ly\u00e2\u0080\u0099n_ is one of the many obsolete forms of the past\nparticiple of the verb \u00e2\u0080\u009cto lie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nII, ii, 125. _tye my hand_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., tie the ribbon-strings which\ndepended from the sleeve over the hand.\n\nII, ii, 163. _slight neglect_--contemptuous disrespect.\n\nII, ii, 174. _bile_--all editors after the Q. read _boil_. _Bile_ was\nan old spelling for _boil_; but in the other sense, one of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfour\nhumours\u00e2\u0080\u009d of medieval physiology, the passage is perfectly clear, and\nthe figure perhaps even more effective.\n\nII, ii, 186. _eager relish_--acrid taste. The figure is that the law in\nitself is often like a sharp and bitter flavor, but that a good judge\nwill sweeten this.\n\nII, ii, 250 _s.\u00c2\u00a0d._ _Drawes a Curtayne_--the curtain of the alcove or\nback-stage, within which was placed the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctreasure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thus to be revealed.\n\nII, ii, 298. _in which yours_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause of the fact of her being\nyours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nII, ii, 301. _for poore and worthlesse I--I_ for _me_, like other\nirregularities in pronominal inflection, was not infrequent in\nElizabethan times. Cf. Abbott, S.\u00c2\u00a0G., \u00c2\u00a7 205.\n\nII, ii, 326. _Curtius-like_--like Marcus Curtius, legendary hero of\nancient Rome. See Livy, vii, 6.\n\nII, ii, _final s.\u00c2\u00a0d._ _while the Act is playing_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., while the\ninterlude music is played, at the close of the Act.\n\nIII, i, 18. _relish_--a trace or tinge of some quality, a\nsuggestion.--In III, i, 20: _a flavor_; or, if read with the Q.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npunctuation, a verb: _give a relish_. It appears preferable, however,\nto take the passage as punctuated by G., S., which makes _relish_ a\nnoun.\n\nIII, i, 29. _take me with you_--understand me.\n\nIII, i, 37. _sudden_--adv. for _suddenly_. The _-ly_ suffix was\nfrequently omitted in Elizabethan times.\n\nIII, i, 45. _Such as are faire_, etc.--the connection goes back to\nl.\u00c2\u00a042, Bellapert taking up again the thread of her remark which\nNovall\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objection and her summary answer thereto had broken in upon.\n\nIII, i, 120. _Christian_--probably used here in the colloq. sense\nof: _a human being_, as distinguished from a brute; a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdecent\u00e2\u0080\u009d or\n\u00e2\u0080\u009crespectable\u00e2\u0080\u009d person. Cf. Shakespeare, _Twelfth Night_, I, iii, 89:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMethinks ... I have no more wit than a Christian, or an ordinary man\nhas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIII, i, 122. _The entertaiment of your visitation_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., the\nentertainment which your visit received.\n\nIII, i, 123. _on_ [old spelling for _one_]--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., a visitation.\n\nIII, i, 126. _Muske-cat_--the civet-cat; applied as a term of contempt\nto a fop, as being a person perfumed with musk.\n\nIII, i, 139. _there is now speaks to you_--G., S. omit _is_, at the\nsame time clearing the construction and securing a more regular metre.\nThe Q. reading, however, is perfectly possible, as an ellipsis, by\nomission of the subject relative, for, _there is that now speaks to\nyou_ [i.\u00c2\u00a0e., _there is now speaking to you_], or even, by a change of\npunctuation, _there is--now speaks to you_--, etc.\n\nIII, i, 148. _As Caesar, did he liue, could not except at_--see\nPlutarch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Life of Julius Caesar_, Chapters 9 & 10, wherein it\nis narrated how Caesar divorced his wife, Pompeia, when scandal\nassailed her name, although he denied any knowledge as to her guilt;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I would have the chastity of my wife clear even of\nsuspicion.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIII, i, 148. _except at_--take exception at.\n\nIII, i, 159. _pointed_--all editors after the Q. read _painted_, an\nabsolutely unnecessary and unwarranted emendation. _Pointed_ means\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfitted or furnished with tagged points or laces;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cwearing points;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009claced.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cf. Maurice Hewlett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novel, _The Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Quair_, p.\u00c2\u00a083:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009csaucy young men, trunked, puffed, pointed, trussed and doubleted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHuloet in his Dictionary (1552) has: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoynted, or tyed with poynts,\n_ligulatus_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIII, i, 167. _This pretty rag_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., the \u00e2\u0080\u009cclout\u00e2\u0080\u009d mentioned in II, ii,\n123.\n\nIII, i, 173. _in spite of_--in scorn of, in defiance of.\n\nIII, i, 184. _thy_--so the Q. All later editors read _this_. It is not\nimpossible, of course, that Romont should begin an oath \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy thy hand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nand Beaumelle flash back at him \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd sword,\u00e2\u0080\u009d transferring the _thy_\nfrom herself to him. But Romont would be more likely to swear by his\nown hand than by Beaumelle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\nIII, i, 188. _cast suburb whores_--prostitutes who had been cashiered\nfrom service. Houses of ill-fame were customarily located in the\nsuburbs.\n\nIII, i, 191. _legion_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., of evil spirits. Cf. _Mark_, v, 9.\n\nIII, i, 193. _horne-mad_--the word was originally applied to horned\nbeasts, in the sense: \u00e2\u0080\u009cenraged so as to horn any one;\u00e2\u0080\u009d hence of\npersons: \u00e2\u0080\u009cstark mad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cmad with rage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cfurious.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By word-play it\nacquires its sense in the present passage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cmad with rage at having\nbeen made a cuckold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIII, i, 202. _yellow_--this color was regarded as a token or symbol of\njealousy.\n\nIII, i, 211. _Carted_--carried in a cart through the streets, by way of\npunishment or public exposure (especially as the punishment of a bawd).\n\nIII, i, 261. _in distance_--within reach, in striking distance.\n\nIII, i, 331. _as it would tire--as_ appears to be used for _as if_; in\nreality the _if_ is implied in the (conditional) subjunctive.--Abbott,\nS.\u00c2\u00a0G., \u00c2\u00a7 107.\n\nIII, i, 331. _a beadle_--it was one of the duties of a beadle to whip\npetty offenders.\n\nIII, i, 352. _So I not heard them_--Abbott explains this construction,\nnot uncommon in the Elizabethan period, as an omission of the auxiliary\nverb \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo\u00e2\u0080\u009d (S.\u00c2\u00a0G. \u00c2\u00a7 305). But here the main verb is _heard_, whereas,\naccording to his explanation, grammar would require _hear_. May not the\nconstruction be better taken as a simple, though to our ears cumbrous,\ninversion of, _So I heard them not_?\n\nIII, i, 366. _cause_--affair, business--so also in III, i, 377.\n\nIII, i, 388. _Calenture_--a disease incident to sailors within the\ntropics; a burning fever.\n\nIII, i, 428-9. _flegme ... choller_--in the old physiologies the\npredominance of the \u00e2\u0080\u009chumour, phlegm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was held to cause constitutional\nindolence or apathy,--the predominance of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccholer\u00e2\u0080\u009d to cause\nirascibility.\n\nIII, i, 432. _\u00e2\u0080\u0099em_--grammatical precision would require _him_, as is\nsubstituted in M., f. In Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rapid, loose style, however, a change\nof construction in mid-sentence is not improbable, and the Q. reading\nmay very well reproduce accurately what he wrote.\n\nIII, i, 441. _thou curious impertinent_--the epithet is from _The\nCurious Impertinent_ of Cervantes, a story imbedded in _Don Quixote,\nPart I_.\n\nIII, i, 463. _I not accuse_--cf. note on l.\u00c2\u00a0354.\n\nIII, i, 467. _Ere liue--Ere I should live_ is required in full by\nstrict grammar, but Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s verse is frequently elliptical. Gifford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nemendation to _lived_ for the sake of grammatical regularity, which is\nfollowed by all later editors, is unwarranted.\n\nIII, i, 467. _mens marginall fingers_--the figure is an allusion to\nthe ancient custom of placing an index hand in the margin of books,\nto direct the reader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention to a striking passage. So does\nRomont picture men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fingers pointing to the story of Charalois as a\nnoteworthy and lamentable thing. Cf. IV, i, 56.\n\nIII, i, 469-470. _An Emperour put away his wife for touching Another\nman._--The source of this allusion is not apparent. Can it be a\nperversion in the mind of Field of the story of Caesar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s divorce of his\nwife, to which Massinger has already referred above (l.\u00c2\u00a0148)?\n\nIV, i, 3. _a flaxe_--the flax wick of a lamp or candle.\n\nIV, i, 3. _a red headed womans chamber_--Since early times red-haired\nindividuals have been supposed to emit an emanation having a powerful\nsexually exciting influence. In the Romance countries, France and\nItaly, this belief is universally diffused.--Iwan Block: _The Sexual\nLife of our Time_--transl. by Eden Paul--p.\u00c2\u00a0622.\n\nCf. also Gabrielle D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Annunzio: _Il Piacere_, p.\u00c2\u00a090:\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Have you noticed the armpits of Madame Chrysoloras? Look!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Duke di Beffi indicated a dancer, who had upon her brow, white\n  as a marble of Luni, a firebrand of red tresses, like a priestess\n  of Alma Tadema. Her bodice was fastened on the shoulders by mere\n  ribbons, and there were revealed beneath the armpits two luxuriant\n  tufts of red hair.\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBomminaco began to discourse upon the peculiar odour which\n  red-haired women have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIV, i, 13. _Cell_--so in the Q. and all later texts. Yet the word is\nutterly unsatisfactory to the sense of the passage; it should almost\ncertainly be _coil_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., tumult, confusion, fuss, ado. Cf. Field in\n_Amends for Ladies_, II, iv: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a coil with a lord and his sister.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIV, i, 23. _a lace_--a trimming of lace.\n\nIV, i, 27. _pickadille_--the expansive collar fashionable in the early\npart of the seventeenth century.\n\nIV, i, 27. _in puncto_--in point; i.\u00c2\u00a0e., in proper condition, in order.\n\nIV, i, 32. _Iacobs staffe_--an instrument formerly used for measuring\nthe altitude of the sun; a cross-staff.\n\nIV, i, 32. _Ephimerides_--a table showing the positions of a heavenly\nbody for a series of successive days.\n\nIV, i, 39-40. _if he would but cut the coate according to the cloth\nstill_--\u00e2\u0080\u009cto cut one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coat after one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cloth\u00e2\u0080\u009d was: \u00e2\u0080\u009cto adapt one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nself to circumstances;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cto measure expense by income.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The point of\nits employment here is not plain; it is doubtful if anything were\nvery clear in Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own mind, who was merely trying to hit off an\nepigrammatical phrase. Perhaps, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake the coat match the man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIV, i, 72. _Narcissus-like_--like Narcissus, in classic myth. See Ovid,\n_Meta._, iii, 341-510.\n\nIV, i, 72. _should_--G., f. read _shouldst_, but the breach of\nagreement between subject and verb is to be explained by the attraction\nof the verb to the third person by the interposed _Narcissus-like_;\njust as four lines further on we find _shouldst_ for _should_, because\nof the similar intrusion between subject and verb of (_but thy selfe\nsweete Lord_).\n\nIV, i, 92. _a Barber Surgeon_--formerly the barber was also a regular\npractitioner in surgery and dentistry. Cf. Beaumont & Fletcher, _The\nKnight of the Burning Pestle_, III, iv.\n\nIV, i, 96. _ouerthrowne_--M., f. read _overflown_, i.\u00c2\u00a0e., become\nexcessive or inordinate; so full that the contents run over the\nbrim. The reading of the Q., however, is quite intelligible,--taking\n_overthrown_ in the sense of _thrown too strongly_.\n\nIV, i, 135. _Colbran_--more properly _Colbrand_ or _Collebrand_, a\nwicked giant in the medieval romance of Guy of Warwick. He is the\nchampion of the invading King of Denmark, who challenges the English\nKing, Athelstan, to produce a knight who can vanquish Colbrand, or to\nyield as his vassal. In this hour of need Guy appears, fights with the\ngiant, and kills him.\n\nIV, i, 137. _hee\u00e2\u0080\u0099l make some of you smoake_,--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake some of you\n_suffer_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cf. Beaumont & Fletcher, _The Knight of the Burning Pestle_,\nI, ii, 136: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make some of \u00e2\u0080\u0099em smoke for\u00e2\u0080\u0099t;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Shakespeare,\n_Titus Andronicus_, IV, iii, 111: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr some of you shall smoke for it in\nRome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIV, i, 138. _a Consort_--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age, the taverns were\ninfested with itinerant bands of musicians, each of which (jointly and\nindividually) was called a noise or _consort_: these were sometimes\ninvited to play for the company, but seem more frequently to have\nthrust themselves, unasked, into it, with an offer of their services:\ntheir intrusion was usually prefaced with, \u00e2\u0080\u0098By your leave, gentlemen,\nwill you hear any music?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Gifford.\n\nIV, i, 145. _of_--formerly sometimes substituted, as here, for _on_ in\ncolloquial usage. So also _on_ for _of_, as in l.\u00c2\u00a0148. Cf. also l.\u00c2\u00a0182.\n\nIV, i, 197-8. _\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis Fairies treasure Which but reueal\u00e2\u0080\u0099d brings on the\nblabbers ruine._--To confide in any one about a fairy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gift rendered\nit void, according to popular tradition, and drew down the fairy\ngiver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anger. In instance, see John Aubrey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Remains_ (Reprinted in\n_Publications of the Folk-Lore Society_, vol. IV, p.\u00c2\u00a0102): \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot far\nfrom Sir Bennet Hoskyns, there was a labouring man, that rose up early\nevery day to go to worke; who for a good while many dayes together\nfound a nine-pence in the way that he went. His wife wondering how he\ncame by so much money, was afraid he gott it not honestlye; at last he\ntold her, and afterwards he never found any more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere are numerous literary allusions to this superstition: e.\u00c2\u00a0g.,\nShakespeare, _The Winter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tale_, III, iii, 127, ff.: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is fairy\ngold, boy; and \u00e2\u0080\u0099twill prove so. Up with\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, keep it close.... We are\nlucky, boy; and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Field himself in _Woman is a Weathercock_, I, i:\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see you labour with some serious thing,\n  And think (like fairy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treasure) to reveal it,\n  Will cause it vanish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIV, i, 210-1. _louers periury_, etc.--that Jove laughed at and\noverlooked lovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perjuries was a familiar proverb. Cf. Massinger,\n_The Parliament of Love_, C-G. 192 a: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJupiter and Venus smile At\nlovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perjuries;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Shakespeare, _Romeo and Juliet_, II, ii, 92:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cat lovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perjuries, They say, Jove laughs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The saying goes back to\nOvid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Art of Love_, book I;--as Marlowe has translated it:\n\n  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor Jove himself sits in the azure skies,\n  And laughs below at lovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perjuries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIV, ii, 71. _On all aduantage take thy life_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaking every\nadvantage of you, kill you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIV, ii, 84. Such whose bloods wrongs, or wrong done to\n_themselues_--the Q.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regular omission of the possessive apostrophe\nhas in this instance confused later editors in their understanding of\nthe passage. We would write _blood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_,--with the meaning: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose whom\nwrongs to kindred or to themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc.\n\nIV, iii, 12. _so_--there is no direct antecedent, but one is easily\nunderstandable from the general sense of what precedes; _to be\nso_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cas you were in thankfulness to the General.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIV, iv, 10. _it_--another case of a pronoun with antecedent merely\nimplied in the general sense of what precedes; _it_ = \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe fact that I\nam not worthy the looking on, but only,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc.\n\nIV, iv, 30. _such defence_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe defence of such a one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d _Such_\n= qualis.\n\nIV, iv, 66. _To this_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., to tears.\n\nIV, iv, 70. _those fam\u00e2\u0080\u0099d matrones_--cf.

Cf. Abbott, S.\u00c2\u00a0G., \u00c2\u00a7 299.\n\nV, i, 5. _lay me vp_--imprison me.\n\nV, i, 7. _varlets_--the name given to city bailiffs or sergeants.\nPerhaps here, however, it is applied merely as a term of abuse.\n\nV, i, 9. _Innes of court man_--a member of one of the four Inns of\nCourt (The Inner Temple, The Middle Temple, Lincoln\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Inn, and Gray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nInn), legal societies which served for the Elizabethan the function\nwhich our law-schools perform to-day. Overbury says of the Inns of\nCourt Man, in his _Characters_: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHee is distinguished from a scholler\nby a pair of silk-stockings, and a beaver hat, which make him contemn\na scholler as much as a scholler doth a school-master.... He is as far\nbehind a courtier in his fashion, as a scholler is behind him.... He\nlaughs at every man whose band sits not well, or that hath not a faire\nshoo-tie, and he is ashamed to be seen in any mans company that weares\nnot his clothes well. His very essence he placeth in his outside....\nYou shall never see him melancholy, but when he wants a new suit, or\nfeares a sergeant....\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nV, i, 13. _coming forth_--appearance in court, or from prison.\n\nV, i, 28. _manchets_--small loaves or rolls of the finest wheaten\nbread. There seems to have been a commonplace concerning the huge\nquantities of bread devoured by tailors. Cf. l.\u00c2\u00a088 below, and Note.\n\nV, i, 31. _leaue swordmen_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., swordmen (swaggering ruffians who\nclaim the profession of arms) _on leave_. It is possible, however, that\n_leaue_ is a misprint (by inversion of a letter) for _leane_ = hungry.\n\nV, i, 83. _hangers_--not \u00e2\u0080\u009cshort-swords\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as in l.\u00c2\u00a031, but here\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cpendants\u00e2\u0080\u009d, perhaps a part of the hat-band hanging loose, or else loops\nor straps on the swordbelt, often richly ornamented, from which the\nsword was hung. Cf. Shakespeare, _Hamlet_, V, ii, 157-167.\n\nV, i, 83. _Hell_--a place under a tailor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop-board, in which shreds\nor pieces of cloth, cut off in the process of cutting clothes, are\nthrown, and looked upon as perquisites. Cf. Overbury\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Characters, A\nTaylor_: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHee differeth altogether from God; for with him the best\npieces are still marked out for damnation, and without hope of recovery\nshall be cast down into hell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nV, i, 88. _Our breakefasts famous for the buttred loaues_--Cf. above\nl.\u00c2\u00a028, and Note; also Glapthorne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Wit in a Constable_, V, i:\n\n         \u00e2\u0080\u009cas easily as a Taylor\n  Would do six hot loaves in a morning fasting,\n  And yet dine after.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nV, i, 90. _vse a conscience_--show or feel compunction; be\ntender-hearted.\n\nV, i, 91. _hall_--a house or building belonging to a guild or\nfraternity of merchants or tradesmen. At such places the business\nof the respective guilds was transacted; and in some instances they\nserved as the market-houses for the sale of the goods of the associated\nmembers.\n\nV, i, 97. _compleate Mounsieur_--perfect gentleman.\n\nV, i, 102. _pantofle_--slipper; here used figuratively for: the\nshoe-maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profession.\n\nV, ii, 27. _a barbarous Sythian_--Cf. Purchas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 _Pilgrimage_ (ed. 1613,\np. 333): \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey [The Scythians] cut off the noses of men, and imprinted\npictures in the flesh of women, whom they overcame: and generally\ntheir customes of warre were bloudie: what man soever the Scythian\nfirst taketh, he drinketh his bloud: he offereth to the King all the\nheads of the men he hath slaine in battell: otherwise he may not share\nin the spoile: the skinnes of their crownes flaid off, they hang at\ntheir horse bridles: their skinnes they use to flay for napkins and\nother uses, and some for cloathing.... These customes were generall to\nthe Scythians of Europe and Asia (for which cause _Scytharum facinora\npatrare_, grew into a proverbe of immane crueltie, and their Land was\njustly called Barbarous).\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nV, ii, 40. _made no hornes at me_--to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake horns\u00e2\u0080\u009d at any one was the\ncommon method of taunting one with having horns,--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., with being a\ncuckold.\n\nV, ii, 51. _made vp with_--set with the expression of.\n\nV, ii, 102. _by pieces_--in part.\n\nV, iii, 8.--Charmi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech is addressed to Charalois, as is that of Du\nCroy which follows it.\n\nV, iii, 18 ff.--M., f. insert _when_ after _that_ of l.\u00c2\u00a018. This is\nprobably the correct reading. It would be possible, however, to let\nthe line stand without alteration, if the _that_ of l.\u00c2\u00a020 be taken\nas coordinate with the _that_ of l.\u00c2\u00a018, introducing a second clause\ndepending on _am sorry_ (instead of correlative with _so_ to introduce\na result-clause). With this reading, _left_ (l.\u00c2\u00a022) would be taken as\nan ellipsis for _being left_; with the emended reading, for _was left_.\nThough the construction is in doubt, the sense is easy.\n\nV, iii, 22. _vndermine_--an object, _it_, is understood,--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., _the\nbuilding of my life_.\n\nV, iii, 34. _her--its_ was rare in Elizabethan usage. Cf. Abbott,\nS.\u00c2\u00a0G., \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 228, 229.\n\nV, iii, 46. _compassion of_--former obsolete construction for\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ccompassion for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cf. Shakespeare, _Henry VI, Part I_, IV, i, 56;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMov\u00e2\u0080\u0099d with compassion of my country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wreck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nV, iii, 59. _motion_--C., f. read _motion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_,--an uncalled-for\nemendation, since ellipsis of _is_ was not infrequent. Cf. Shakespeare,\n_Henry V_, IV, i, 197: \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill\n[is] upon his own head.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nV, iii, 93. _and yet the fault kept from me_--loose construction, not\neasily parsed, though the sense is clear.\n\nV, iii, 98. _As ... to vndergoe_--again a loose construction. It should\nbe, properly: _That ... he would undergo_, etc.\n\nV, iii, 107-9. _like the fatall gold_, etc.--In this passage the two\nleaders of the Gauls known to history by the same name appear to be\nconfounded--(1): Brennus, who sacked Rome in 390 B.\u00c2\u00a0C., and consented\nto withdraw after receiving a large ransom of gold;--and (2): Brennus,\nwho led the irruption of the Gauls into Greece in the second century\nB.\u00c2\u00a0C., and attempted to despoil Delphi of its treasure, but did not\nsucceed in doing so. The fact that their respective expeditions are\nsaid to have borne an immediate sequel of disaster and death for both\nalike, may be responsible for the dramatist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mistake.\n\nV, iii, 131. _homicide_--formerly, as here, = _murderer_.\n\nV, iii, 139. _in way of_--in the manner of.\n\nV, iii, 144. _the hate betweene his house and mine_--cf. III, i, 416.\n\nV, iii, 166. _more presumptions_--C., f. read _mere presumptions_,\nwhich is probably correct. An alternative possibility should be\nnoted, however: that _presumptions_ by mis-reading from the Ms. (or\nby the mere inversion of a _u_) may be a mis-print for presumptious\n(presumptuous) = _presumptive_, in which case _more_ would be retained,\nwith the passage to mean: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must find other proofs to strengthen\nthese, and they must, moreover, be of a nature to give more reasonable\ngrounds for presumption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nV, iii, 174-5.--The last two lines of Charalois\u00e2\u0080\u0099 speech are addressed\nto his judges; what preceded them to Novall.\n\nV, iii, 190. _bands_--the emendation _bawds_, proposed by Coxeter and\nfollowed by all subsequent editors, seems almost surely correct. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBawd\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nprior to 1700 was a term applied to men as well as--and, indeed, more\nfrequently than--to women. Cf. Shakespeare, _Hamlet_, I, iii, 130.\n\nV, iii, 190. _tooke_--where the common Elizabethan custom of dropping\nthe _-en_ inflectional ending of the past participle rendered a\nconfusion with the infinitive liable, the past tense of the verb was\nused for the participle. Cf. Abbott, S.\u00c2\u00a0G., \u00c2\u00a7 343.\n\nV, iii, 193. _this matron_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., Florimel.\n\nV, iii, 205. _in Nouall_--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the person of Novall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nV, iii, 207. _Thy challenge now I answere_--this phrase would indicate\nthat Romont crosses swords with Pontalier, and after a moment of\nfencing runs him through; instead of striking him unawares, as the\nmodern stage direction, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Stabs Pontalier_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d would imply.\n\nV, iii, 226. _these--i.\u00c2\u00a0e._, Aymer, Florimel, and Bellapert.\n\n_Court. Song_, l.\u00c2\u00a03. first--i.\u00c2\u00a0e., \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the front part of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to meet the\ncustomers and be herself an attraction and an object of display, while\nthe husband remains \u00e2\u0080\u009cat tother end\u00e2\u0080\u009d (l.\u00c2\u00a08) of the store.\n\n_Court. Song_, l.\u00c2\u00a04.--This is a most unduly long line. It seems\nprobable that, in the Ms. from which the play was printed, the three\nphrases, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA faire wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009ca kinde wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ca sweet wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d were\n_three variant_ readings, which, by mistake, were _all_ incorporated in\nthe text.

Dra._, I, 208) thinks that the otherwise lost\nMassinger play, _The Judge_, licensed by Herbert in 1627, and included\nin the list of Warburton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection, may have been _The Fatal Dowry_.\nHe declares, moreover, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe decree in favor of creditors in I, ii\n_a_ was a statute made in 1623,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and suggests that Massinger after this\ndate made over an independent play of Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, now lost. But I think\nthat any one who surveys in _The Fatal Dowry_ the respective hands of\nits authors will incline strongly to the conviction that this drama is\nthe offspring of joint effort rather than the re-handling of one man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwork by another. The decree to which Fleay has reference appears to be\nthat to be found in _Statutes of the Realm_, IV, ii, 1227-9, recorded\nas 21\u00c2\u00ba Jac I, 19. This is an act passed by the parliament of 1623-4;\nit somewhat increases the stringency of the already-existing severe\nlaws in regard to bankrupts, but contains nothing which even faintly\nsuggests the decree in our play, by which the creditors are empowered\nto withhold the corpse of their debtor from burial; and, indeed, it is\nobviously impossible that a statute permitting any such practice could\nhave been passed in Christian England of the seventeenth century. The\nfact is that this feature of the plot is taken direct from a classical\nauthor (see under SOURCES), and it would be gratuitous to assume in\nit a reference to contemporaneous legislation. As for the hypothesis\nthat _The Fatal Dowry_ and _The Judge_ are the same play, in the utter\nabsence of any supporting evidence it must be thrown out of court. This\nsort of identification is a confirmed vice with Fleay. _The Judge_\nis, moreover, listed as a comedy (see reprint of Warburton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list in\nFleay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _The Life and Work of Shakespeare_, p.\u00c2\u00a0358).\n\n[2] Two other arguments--both fallacious--have been advanced for a more\nassured dating.\n\nFormal prologues and epilogues came into fashion about 1620, and the\nabsence of such appendages in the case of _The Fatal Dowry_ has been\ngenerally taken as evidence for its appearance before that year; but\nfor a Massinger production no such inference can be drawn--there is\nno formal prologue or epilogue in any of his extant plays before _The\nEmperor of the East_ and _Believe as You List_, which were licensed for\nacting in 1631.\n\nThe suggestion (Fleay: _Chron. Eng. Dra._, I, p.\u00c2\u00a0208) that Field took\nthe part of Florimel, and that the mention of her age as thirty-two\nyears (II, ii, 17) has reference to his own age at the time the play\nwas produced (thus fixing the date: 1619), is an idea so far-fetched\nand fantastic that it is amazing to find it quoted with perfect gravity\nby Ward (_Hist. Eng. Dra. Lit._, III, 39). That Field, second only to\nBurbage among the actors of his time, should have played the petty role\nof Florimel is a ridiculous supposition. It is strange that anyone who\nconsidered references of this sort a legitimate clue did not build\nrather upon the statement (II, i, 13) that Charalois was twenty-eight.\nBut such grounds for theorizing are utterly unsubstantial; there is no\nearthly warrant for identifying the age of an author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creation with\nthe age of the author himself.\n\n[3] I would not, however, think it very improbable that Field might\nhave engaged in the composition of _The Fatal Dowry_ immediately after\nhis retirement, when the ties with his old profession were, perhaps,\nnot yet altogether broken.\n\n[4] On a careful inspection of the entire dramatic output of Massinger,\nboth unaided work and plays done in collaboration, I have found worthy\nof record parallels to passages in _The Fatal Dowry_ to the number of:\n24, in _The Unnatural Combat_, 14 in the Massinger share (about \u00e2\u0085\u0097) of\n_The Virgin Martyr_, 18 in _The Renegado_, 11 in _The Duke of Milan_,\n10 in _The Guardian_, and in none of the rest as many as 8.--But\nMassinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undoubted share (\u00e2\u0085\u0093) of _The Little French Lawyer_ yields 6;\n\u00e2\u0085\u0096 of _The Double Marriage_, 6; \u00e2\u0085\u0096 of _The Spanish Curate_, 6; \u00e2\u0085\u0096 of _Sir\nJohn van Olden Barnavelt_, 4.\n\n[5] _E. g._, I, i (Massinger) with its grave rhetoric uniformly\nsustained, and, in immediate succession, II, i (Decker), a medley of\ncoarse buffoonery and tender and beautiful verse.\n\n[6] As witness _The False One_. Here Massinger seems to have projected\na stately historical drama of war and factional intrigue, with a\nconception of Cleopatra as the Great Queen, more a Semiramis or a\nZenobia than \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe serpent of old Nile,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and so treats his subject in\nthe first and last Acts; while Fletcher \u00e2\u0080\u009cassists\u00e2\u0080\u009d him by filling the\nmiddle section of the play with scenes theatrically effective but\nleading nowhere, and in them makes the heroine the traditional \u00e2\u0080\u009cgipsy\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nCleopatra.\n\n[7] The only other modern attempt to apportion the play is that of\nC. Beck (_The Fatal Dowry_, Friedrich-Alexander Univ. thesis, 1906,\npp.\u00c2\u00a089-94). He assigns Massinger everything except the prose passages\nof II, ii and IV, i, and perhaps II, i, 93-109. His _a priori_ theory\nof distribution seems to be that all portions of the play which he\ndeems of worth must be Massinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. It is difficult to speak of Beck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmonograph with sufficiently scant respect.\n\n[8] References to the plays of Massinger are either by page and column\nof the Cunningham-Gifford edition of his works (designated C-G.), or,\nin the case of plays in the Beaumont & Fletcher _corpus_ in which he or\nField collaborated, by volume and page of the Dyce edition (designated\n_D._). Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two independent comedies are referred to by page of\nthe Mermaid Series volume which contains them: _Nero and Other Plays_\n(designated _M._).\n\n[9] The figures for the speech-ending test for each scene will be found\nin the table at the end of this section, and are not given in the\ncourse of the detailed examination of the play, save in the case of one\npassage, where the ambiguity of their testimony is noted. In all other\nScenes they merely corroborate the evidence of the other tests.\n\n[10] This is all the more rampant in that it is suddenly called back\ninto activity after its period of obscuration while she yielded herself\nto a cynical, immoral opportunism, and is now brought, by a fearful\nshock, to confront higher ethical values and real manhood. For this\ntime she is given not a Novall but a Charalois to idealize.\n\n[11] See the figure of Captain Pouts in _Woman is a Weathercock_. He\nmight easily have been made a mere _miles gloriosus_; instead he is a\nreal man,--coarse, revengeful, dissolute, quarrelsome, hectoring--no\ndoubt at heart a coward, but not more absurdly so in the face of his\npretensions than many of his type in actual life. For characters\nclearly visualized in a few simple strokes, may be noted in the same\nplay Lady Ninny, Lucida, and, apart from one speech (M. 356-7) out of\ncharacter obviously for comic effect, Kate; in _Amends for Ladies_,\nIngen. Examples of Field\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power in more idealistic work may be found\nin _The Knight of Malta_ in the delineation of Montferrat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passion (I,\ni) and in the scene between Miranda and Oriana (V, i).\n\n[12] Apparently _The Fatal Dowry_ was not performed every day.\n\n[13] During the run of this play one Warren, who was Powell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dresser,\nclaimed a right of lying for his master and performing the dead part\nof Lothario--about the middle of the scene Powell called for Warren;\nwho as loudly replied from the stage, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere Sir\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Powell (who was\nignorant of the part his man was doing) repeated without loss of time,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome here this moment you Son of a Whore or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll break all the bones\nin your skin\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Warren knew his hasty temper, and therefore without any\nreply jumped up with all his sables about him, which unfortunately were\ntied to the handles of the bier and dragged after him--but this was\nnot all--the laugh and roar began in the audience and frightened poor\nWarren so much that with the bier at his tail he threw down Calista and\noverwhelmed her, with the table, lamp, books, bones, &c.--he tugged\ntill he broke off his trammels and made his escape, and the play at\nonce ended with immoderate fits of laughter--Betterton would not suffer\nThe Fair Penitent to be played again, till poor Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misconduct\nwas somewhat forgotten--this story was told to Chetwood by Bowman\n[Sciolto]--(GENEST, II, 281-2).\n\n[14] This, of course, may require the substitution of a capital for\na small letter, as when a mid-line word of the Quarto becomes in the\nre-alignment the first word of the verse.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes: the Play\n\n\n[Dramatis Personae]\n\nG. and S. omit _Officers_, and add those roles which are enclosed in\nbrackets.\n\nThey add explanations of each character, also changing the order.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1249,"split":"test"}
