The best way\nto enjoy it is to follow the path along the meadows, underneath the\ninland rampart of the Sussex hills. Here is pasture rich enough for\nthe daintiest sheep to dream upon; tones of varied green in stripes\n(by order of the farmer), trees as for a portrait grouped, with the\nfolding hills behind, and light and shadow making love in play to one\nanother. Also, in the breaks of meadow and the footpath bendings,\nstiles where love is made in earnest, at the proper time of year, with\nthe dark-browed hills imposing everlasting constancy.\n\nAny man here, however sore he may be from the road of life, after\nsitting awhile and gazing, finds the good will of his younger days\nrevive with a wider capacity. Though he hold no commune with the\nheights so far above him, neither with the trees that stand in quiet\naudience soothingly, nor even with the flowers still as bright as\nin his childhood, yet to himself he must say something--better said\nin silence. Into his mind, and heart, and soul, without any painful\nknowledge, or the noisy trouble of thinking, pure content with his\nnative land and its claim on his love are entering. The power of the\nearth is round him with its lavish gifts of life,--bounty from the lap\nof beauty, and that cultivated glory which no other land has earned.\n\nInstead of panting to rush abroad and be lost among jagged obstacles,\nrather let one stay within a very easy reach of home, and spare an\nhour to saunter gently down this meadow path. Here in a broad bold gap\nof hedge, with bushes inclined to heal the breach, and mallow-leaves\nhiding the scar of chalk, here is a stile of no high pretence, and\ncomfortable to gaze from. For hath it not a preface of planks,\nconstructed with deep anatomical knowledge, and delicate study of\nmaiden decorum? And lo! in spite of the planks--as if to show what\nhuman nature is--in the body of the stile itself, towards the end of\nthe third bar down, are two considerable nicks, where the short-legged\nchildren from the village have a sad habit of coming to think. Here,\nwith their fingers in their mouths, they sit and muse, and scrape their\nheels, and stare at one another, broadly taking estimate of life. Then\nwith a push and scream, the scramble and the rush down hill begin,\nending (as all troubles should) in a brisk pull-up of laughter.\n\nHowever, it might be too much to say that the cleverest child beneath\nthe hills, or even the man with the licence to sell tea, coffee, snuff,\nand tobacco, who now comes looking after them, finds any conscious\npleasure, or feels quickening influence from the scene. To them it is\nbut a spread of meadows under a long curve of hill, green and mixed\nwith trees down here, brown and spotted with furze up there; to the\nchildren a play-ground; to the men a farm, requiring repairs and a good\nbit of manure.\n\nSo it is: and yet with even those who think no more of it, the place,\nif not the scenery, has its aftermath of influence. In later times,\nwhen sickness, absence, or the loss of sight debars them, men will\nfeel a deep impression of a thing to long for. To be longed for with\na yearning stronger than mere admiration, or the painter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taste can\nform. For he, whatever pleasure rises at the beauty of the scene,\nloses it by thinking of it; even as the joy of all things dies in the\nenjoying.\n\nBut to those who there were born (and never thought about it),\nin the days of age or ailment, or of better fortune even in a\nbrighter climate, how at the sound of an ancient name, or glimpse\nof faint resemblance, or even on some turn of thought untraced and\nunaccountable--again the hills and valleys spread, to aged vision truer\nthan they were to youthful eyesight; again the trees are rustling in\nthe wind as they used to rustle; again the sheep climb up the brown\nturf in their snowy zigzag. A thousand winks of childhood widen into\none clear dream of age.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nCOOMBE LORRAINE.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow came that old house up there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d is generally the first question put\nby a Londoner to his Southdown friend leading him through the lowland\npath. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must have a noble view; but what a position, and what an\naspect!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe house has been there long enough to get used to it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is his\nhost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reply; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it is not built, as they are where you live, of the\nsubstance of a hat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat large old-fashioned house, which looks as if it had been much\nlarger, stands just beneath the crest of a long-backed hill in a\ndeep embrasure. Although it stands so high, and sees much less of\nthe sun than the polestar, it is not quite so weather-beaten as a\nstranger would suppose. It has some little protection, and a definite\noutline for its grounds, because it was built on an old and extensive\nsettlement of the chalk; a thing unheeded in early times, but now very\npopular and attractive, under the name of \u00e2\u0080\u009clandslip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of these there\nare a good many still to be traced on the sides of the Sussex hills,\ncaused (as the learned say) by the shifting of the green-sand, or silt,\nwhich generally underlies the more stable chalk. Few, however, of them\nare so strongly marked and bold as this one, which is known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCoombe\nLorraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is no mere depression or irregular subsidence, but a\nsheer vertical drop, which shows as if a broad slice had been cut out\nfrom the chine to the base of the highland.\n\nHere, in the time of William Rufus, Roland de Lorraine, having a\ngrant from him, or from the Conqueror, and trusting the soil to\nslide no more, or ignorant that it had ever slidden, built himself\na dwelling-place to keep a look-out on his property. This abode, no\ndoubt, was fitted for warlike domesticity, being founded in the fine\nold times when every gentleman was bound to build himself a castle.\n\nIt may have been that a little jealousy of his friend, De Braose (who\nhad taken a larger grant of land, although he was of newer race, and\nhad killed fewer men than Sir Roland), led this enterprising founder\nto set up his tower so high. At any rate, he settled his Penates so\ncommandingly, that if Bramber Castle had been in sight, he might have\nlooked down its chimneys as freely as into his villeins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sheepcotes.\nBramber Castle, however, happened to be round the corner.\n\nThis good knight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end, according to the tradition of the family, was\nnot so thoroughly peaceful as a life of war should earn. One gentle\nautumnal evening, Sir Roland and his friend and neighbour, William de\nBraose, were riding home to a quiet supper, both in excellent temper\nand spirits, and pleasant contempt of the country. The harvest-moon was\nrising over breadths of corn in grant to them, and sheep and cattle\ntended by their villeins, once the owners. Each congratulated the other\nupon tranquil seizin, and the goodwill of the neighbourhood; when\nsuddenly their way was stopped by a score of heavy Englishmen.\n\nThese, in their clumsy manner, sued no favour, nor even justice; only\nto be trodden down with fairness and show of reason.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe shall be trodden all alike,\u00e2\u0080\u009d De Braose shouted fiercely, having\nlearned a good deal of English from the place he lived in; \u00e2\u0080\u009cclods are\nmade to be trodden down. Out of my road, or I draw my sword!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe men turned from him to Sir Roland, who was known to be kind of\nheart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe do the wrong thing to meet me thus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered in his utmost\nEnglish; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe thing, that is to say I hearken; but not with this\nviolence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSpeaking thus he spurred his horse, and the best of the men made way\nfor him. But one of them had an arrow straining on the cord, with\nintent to shoot--as he said to the priest at the gallows--De Braose,\nand him only. As the two knights galloped off, he let his arrow, in\nthe waning of the light, fly after them; and it was so strongly sped\nthat it pierced back-harness, and passed through the reins of Roland de\nLorraine. Thus he died; and his descendants like to tell the story.\n\nIt is not true, although maintained by descendants of De Braose, that\nhe was the man that was shot, and the knight who ran away Sir Roland.\nThe pious duties rendered by the five brave monks from F\u00c3\u00a9camp were for\nthe soul of Sir Roland, as surely as the arrow was for the body of\nDe Braose. But after eight hundred years almost, let the benefit go\nbetween them.\n\nWhichever way this may have chanced, in an age of unsettled principles,\nsure it is that the good knight died, either then or afterwards. Also,\nthat a man was hanged at a spot still shown in his behalf, and that\nhe felt it such an outrage on his sense of justice, after missing his\nproper shot, that even now he is often seen, when the harvest-moon is\nlonely, straining a long bow at something, but most careful not to\nshoot.\n\nThese, however, are mere legends, wherewith we have nought to do. And\nit would have been as well to leave them in their quiet slumber, if it\ncould have been shown without them how the house was built up there.\nAlso one may fairly fancy that a sweet and gallant knight may have\nfound his own vague pleasure in a fine and ample view. Regarding which\nmatter we are perhaps a little too hard on our ancestors; presuming\nthat they never owned such eyes as ours for \u00e2\u0080\u009cscenery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because they\nknew the large impossibility of describing it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nLINEAGE AND LINEAMENTS.\n\n\nWhether his fathers felt, or failed to see, the beauty beneath their\neyes, the owner of this house and land, at the time we have to speak\nof, deserved and had the true respect of all who dwelled below him.\n\nIt is often said that no direct descendant, bred from sire to son,\nstill exists (or at any rate can show that he has right to exist) from\nany knight, or even cook, known to have come with the Conqueror. The\nquestion is one of delicacy, and therefore of deep feeling. But it must\nbe owned, in candour, upon almost every side, that there are people,\nhere and there, able to show something. The present Sir Roland Lorraine\ncould show as much in this behalf as any other man in England. Here was\nthe name, and here the place; and here that more fugitive being, man,\nstill belonging to both of them.\n\nWhether could be shown or not the strict red line of lineage, Sir\nRoland Lorraine was the very last man likely to assert it. He had his\nown opinions on that all-important subject, and his own little touches\nof feeling when the matter came into bearing. His pride was of so\nlarge a nature, that he seldom could be proud. He had his pleasant\nvein of humour about almost everything, wholly free from scoffing, and\nmost sensitive of its limit. Also, although he laid no claim to any\nextensive learning, or especially accurate scholarship, his reading had\nbeen various; and his knowledge of the classics had not been allowed to\nfade away into misty memory.\n\nInasmuch as he added to these resources the further recommendation of\na fine appearance and gentle manners, good position and fair estates,\nit may be supposed that Sir Roland was in strong demand among his\nneighbours for all social purposes. He, however, through no petty\nfeeling or small exclusiveness, but from his own taste and likings,\nkept himself more and more at home, and in quietude, as he grew older.\nSo that ere he turned sixty years, the owner of Coombe Lorraine had\nceased to appear at any county gatherings, or even at the hospitable\nmeetings of the neighbourhood.\n\nHis dinner-party consisted only of himself and his daughter Alice.\nHis wife had been dead for many years. His mother, Lady Valeria, was\nstill alive and very active, and having just numbered fourscore years,\nhad attained the right of her own way. By right or wrong, she had\nalways contrived to enjoy that special easement; and even now, though\nshe lived apart, little could be done without her in the household\nmanagement.\n\nHilary, Sir Roland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only son, was now at the Temple, eating his way\nto the bar, or feeding for some other mischief; and Alice, the only\ndaughter living, was the baronet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favourite companion, and his darling.\n\nNow, whether from purity of descent, or special mode of selection,\nor from living so long on a hill with northern consequences, or\nfrom some other cause, to be extracted by philosophers from bestial\nanalogies--anyhow, one thing is certain, these Lorraines were not,\nand had not for a long time been, at all like the rest of the world\naround them. It was not pride of race that made them unambitious, and\nwell content, and difficult to get at. Neither was it any other ill\naffection to mankind. They liked a good man, when they saw him; and\nnaturally so much the more, as it became harder to find him. Also they\nwere very kind to all the poor people around them, and kept well in\nwith the Church, and did whatever else is comely. But long before Sir\nRoland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time all Sussex knew, and was content to know, that, as a\ngeneral rule, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose Lorraines went nowhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNeighbours who were conscious of what we must now begin to call\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cco-operative origin\u00e2\u0080\u009d felt that though themselves could claim justices\nof the peace, high sheriffs, and knights of the shire among their\nkin, yet they could not quite leap over that romantic bar of ages\nwhich is so deterrent, perhaps because it is so shadowy. Neither did\nthey greatly care to press their company upon people so different\nfrom themselves, and so unlikely to admire them. But if any one asked\nwhere lay the root of the difference, which so long had marked the old\nfamily on the hill, perhaps no one (least of all any of the Lorraines\nthemselves) could have given the proper answer. Plenty of other folk\nthere were who held aloof from public life. Simplicity, kindness, and\nchivalry might be found, by a man with an active horse, in other places\nalso: even a feeling, as nearly akin as our nature admits to contempt\nof money, at that time went on somewhere. How, then, differed these\nLorraines from other people of equal rank and like habits with them?\n\nMen who differ from their fellows seem, by some law of nature, to\nresent and disclaim the difference. Those who are proud, and glory in\ntheir variance from the common type, seldom vary much from it. So that\nin the year of grace 1811, the mighty comet that scared the world,\nspreading its tail over good and bad, overhung no house less conscious\nof anything under its roof peculiar, than the house of Coombe Lorraine.\n\nWith these Lorraines there had been a tradition (ripened, as traditions\nripen, into a small religion), that a certain sequence of Christian\nnames must be observed, whenever allowed by Providence, in the\nheritage. These names in right order were Roland, Hilary, and Roger;\nand the family had long believed, and so had all their tenants, that\na certain sequence of character, and the events which depend upon\ncharacter, might be expected to coincide with the succession of these\nnames. The Rolands were always kindly proud, fond of home and of their\nown people, lovers of a quiet life, and rather deep than hot of heart.\nA Hilary, the next of race, was prone to the opposite extremes, though\nstill of the same root-fibre. Sir Hilary was always showy, affable,\nand romantic, eager to do something great, pleased to give pleasure to\neverybody, and leaving his children to count the cost. After him there\nought to arise a Roger, the saviour of the race; beginning to count\npence in his cradle, and growing a yard in common-sense for every inch\nof his stature, frowning at every idea that was not either of land or\nmoney, and weighing himself and his bride, and most of his principles,\nby troy-weight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nFATHER AND FAVOURITE.\n\n\nUpon a very important day (as it proved to be, in his little world),\nthe 18th of June, 1811, Sir Roland Lorraine had enjoyed his dinner with\nhis daughter Alice. In those days men were not content to feed in the\nfashion of owls, or wild ducks, who have lain abed all day. In winter\nor summer, at Coombe Lorraine, the dinner-bell rang at half-past four,\nfor people to dress; and again at five, for all to be down in the\ndrawing-room. And all were sure to be prompt enough; for the air of the\nSouthdown hills is hungry; and Nature knew what the demand would be,\nbefore she supplied her best mutton there.\n\nWhen the worthy old butler was gone at last, and the long dark room lay\nsilent, Alice ran up to her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, to wish him, over a sip of\nwine, the good old wish that sits so lightly on the lips of children.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDarling papa, I wish you many happy, happy returns of the day, and\ngood health to enjoy them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland was sixty years old that day; and being of a cheerful, even,\nand pleasant, though shy temperament, he saw no reason why he should\nnot have all the bliss invoked on him. The one great element in that\nhappiness now was looking at him, undeniably present and determined to\nremain so.\n\nHis quick glance told that he felt all this; but he was not wont to\nshow what he felt; and now he had no particular reason to feel more\nthan usual. Nevertheless he did so feel, without knowing any reason,\nand turned his eyes away from hers, while he tried to answer lightly.\n\nThis would not do for his daughter Alice. She was now in that blush of\ntime, when everything is observed by maidens, but everything is not\nhinted at. At least it used to be so then, and still is so in good\nplaces. Therefore Alice thought a little, before she began to talk\nagain. The only trouble, to her knowledge, which her father had to deal\nwith, was the unstable and romantic character of young Hilary. This he\nnever discussed with her, nor even alluded to it; for that would have\nbeen a breach of the law in all duly-entailed conservatism, that the\nheir of the house, even though a fool, must have his folly kept sacred\nfrom the smiles of inferior members. Now, Hilary was not at all a fool;\nonly a young man of large mind.\n\nKnowing that her father had not any bad news of Hilary, from whom\nhe had received a very affectionate letter that morning, Alice was\nsorely puzzled, but scarcely ventured to ask questions; for in this\nsavage island then, respect was shown and reverence felt by children\ntowards their parents; and she, although such a petted child, was full\nof these fine sentiments. Also now in her seventeenth year, she knew\nthat she had outgrown the playful freedoms of the babyhood, but was\nnot yet established in the dignity of a maiden, much less the glory\nof womanhood. So that her sunny smile was fading into the shadow of a\nsigh, when instead of laying her pretty head on her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder,\nshe brought the low chair and favourite cushion of the younger times,\nand thence looked up at him, hoping fondly once more to be folded back\ninto the love of childhood.\n\nWhatever Sir Roland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trouble was, it did not engross his thoughts so\nmuch as to make him neglect his favourite. He answered her wistful gaze\nwith a smile, which she knew to be quite genuine; and then he patted\nher curly hair, in the old-fashioned way, and kissed her forehead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLallie, you look so profoundly wise, I shall put you into caps after\nall, in spite of your sighs, and tears, and sobs. A head so mature in\nits wisdom must conform to the wisdom of the age.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, they are such hideous things! and you hate them as much as I do.\nAnd only the other day you said that even married people had no right\nto make such frights of themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarried people have a right to please one another only. A narrow view,\nperhaps, of justice; but--however, that is different. Alice, you never\nwill attend when I try to teach you anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland broke off lamely thus, because his child was attending,\nmore than himself, to what he was talking of. Like other men, he was\nsometimes given to exceed his meaning; but with his daughter he was\nalways very careful of his words, because she had lost her mother, and\nnone could ever make up the difference.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice, with that appealing stress upon the paternity\nwhich only a pet child can throw, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are not at all like yourself\nto-day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear, most people differ from themselves, with great advantage. But\nyou will never think that of me. Now let me know your opinion as to all\nthis matter, darling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer father softened off his ending suddenly thus, because he saw the\nyoung girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes begin to glisten, as if for tears, at his strange new\nway.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat matter, papa? The caps? Oh no; the way you are now behaving. Very\nwell then, are you quite sure you can bear to hear all you have done\namiss?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my dear, I am not at all sure. But I will try to endure your most\nheartrending exaggerations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, dear papa, you shall have it all. Only tell me when to stop. In\nthe first place, did you or did you not, refuse to have Hilary home for\nyour birthday, much as you knew that I wanted him? You confess that you\ndid. And your only reason was something you said about Trinity term,\nsadly incomprehensible. In the next place, when I wanted you to have a\nlittle change to-day, Uncle Struan for dinner, and Sir Remnant, and one\nor two others----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear, how could I eat all these? Think of your Uncle Struan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, you are only trying now to provoke me, because you cannot\nanswer. You know what I mean as well as I do, and perhaps a little\nbetter. What I mean is, one or two of the very oldest friends and\nrelations to do what was nice, and help you to get on with your\nbirthday; but you said, with unusual ferocity, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Darling, I will have\nnone but you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my word, I believe I did! How wonderfully women--at least I mean\nhow children--astonish one, by the way they touch the very tone of\nutterance, after one has forgotten it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you mean, papa. And your reflection seems to be\nmeant for yourself, as everything seems to be for at least a week, or I\nmight say----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, Lallie, come now, have some moderation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, papa, for at least a fortnight. I will let you off with\nthat, though I know it is much too little. And when you have owned\nto that, papa, what good reason can you give for behaving so to\nme--me--me, as good a child as ever there was?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan \u00e2\u0080\u0098me, me, me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 after living through such a fortnight of\nmortification--the real length of the period being less than four\nhours, I believe--can she listen to a little story without any\nexcitement?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, papa, a story, a story! That will make up for everything. What a\nlovely pleasure! There is nothing I love half so much as listening to\nold stories. I seem to be living my old age over, before I come to any\nage. Papa, I will forgive you everything, if you tell me a story.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice, you are a little too bad. I know what a very good girl you are;\nbut still you ought to try to think. When you were only two years old,\nyou looked as if you were always thinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I am now, papa; always thinking--how to please you, and do my\nbest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland was beaten by this, because he knew the perfect truth of it.\nAlice already thought too much about everything she could think of.\nHer father knew how bad it is when the bright young time is clouded\nover with unreasonable cares; and often he had sore misgivings, lest\nhe might be keeping his pet child too much alone. But she only laughed\nwhenever he offered to find her new companions, and said that her\ncousins at the rectory were enough for her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you please, papa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she now broke in upon his thinking, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow long\nwill it be before you begin to tell me this beautiful story?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy own darling, I forgot; I was thinking of you, and not of any\ntrumpery stories. But this is the very day of all days to sift our\nlittle mystery. You have often heard, of course, about our old\nastrologer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I have, papa--of course! And with all my heart I love him.\nEverything the shepherds tell me shows how thoroughly good he was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, then, all my story is about him, and his deeds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, papa, then do try, for once in your life, to be in a hurry. I do\nlove everything about him; and I have heard so many things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt you have, my dear; but perhaps of a somewhat fabulous order.\nHis mind, or his manners, or appearance, or at any rate something seems\nto have left a lasting impression upon the simple folk hereabout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter than a pot of money; an old woman told me the other day it was\nbetter than a pot of money for anybody to dream of him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would do them more good, no doubt. But I have not had a pinch of\nsnuff to-day. You have nearly broken me, Alice; but still you do allow\nme one pinch, when I begin to tell you a good story.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThree, papa; you shall have three now, and you may take them all at\nonce, because you never told such a story, as I feel sure it is certain\nto be, in all the whole course of your life before. Now come here,\nwhere the sun is setting, so that I may watch the way you are telling\nevery word of it; and if I ask you any questions you must nod your\nhead, but never presume to answer one of them, unless you are sure\nthat it will go on without interrupting the story. Now, papa, no more\ndelay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHE LEGEND OF THE ASTROLOGER.\n\n\nTwo hundred years before the day when Alice thus sat listening, an\nancestor of hers had been renowned in Anatolia. The most accomplished\nand most learned prince in all Lesser Asia was Agasicles Syennesis,\ndescended from Mausolus (made immortal by his mausoleum), and from\nthat celebrated king, Syennesis of Cilicia. There had been, after both\nthese were dead, and much of their repute gone by, creditable and happy\nmarriages in and out their descendants, at a little over and a little\nunder, twenty-two centuries ago; and the best result and issue of all\nthese was now embodied in Prince Agasicles.\n\nThe prince was not a patron only, but also an eager student of the\nmore recondite arts and sciences then in cultivation. Especially he\nhad given his mind to chemistry (including alchemy), mineralogy, and\nastrology. Devoting himself to these fine subjects, and many others,\nhe seems to have neglected anthropology; so that in his fiftieth year\nhe was but a lonesome bachelor. Troubled at this time of his life with\nmany expostulations--genuine on the part of his friends, and emphatic\non that of his relatives--he held a long interview with the stars, and\ntaking their advice exactly as they gave and meant it, married a wife\nthe next afternoon, and (so far as he could make out) the right one.\nThis turned out well. His wife went off on the occasion of her first\nconfinement, leaving him with a daughter, born A.D. 1590, and all women\npronounced her beautiful.\n\nThe prince now spent his leisure time in thought and calculation.\nHe had almost made his mind up that he was sure to have a son; and\nhere was his wife gone; and how could he risk his life again so? Upon\nthe whole, he made up his mind, that matters might have been worse,\nalthough they ought to have been much better, and that he must thank\nthe stars, and not be too hard upon any one; and so he fell to at his\nscience again, and studied almost everything.\n\nIn that ancient corner of the world, old Caria, the fine original\nLeleges looked up to the prince, and loved him warmly, and were ready\nby night or day to serve him, or to rob him. They saw that now was the\nfinest chance (while he was looking at the stars, with no wife to look\nout for him) for them to do their duty to their families by robbing\nhim; and this they did with honest comfort, and a sense of going home\nin the proper way to go.\n\nPrince Agasicles, growing older, felt these troubles more and more.\nAs a general rule, a man growing older has a more extensive knowledge\nthat he must be robbed of course; and yet he scarcely ever seems to\nreconcile himself with maturing wisdom to the process. And so it\nhappened to this good prince; not that he cared so very much about\nlittle trifles that might attract the eye of taste and the hand of\nskill, but that he could not (even with the aid of all the stars) find\nanything too valuable to be stolen. Hence, as his daughter, Artemise,\ngrew to the fulness of young beauty, he thought it wise to raise the\nmost substantial barrier he could build betwixt her and the outer world.\n\nThere happened to be in that neighbourhood then an active supply of\nvillains. Of this by no means singular fact the prince might well\nassure himself, by casting his eyes down from the stars to the narrow\nbosom of his mother earth. But whether thus or otherwise forewarned\nof local mischief, the Carian prince took a very strong measure, and\neven a sacrilegious one. In or about the year of our reckoning, 1606,\nhe walled off his daughter, and other goods, in a certain peninsula of\nhis own, clearly displayed in our maps, and as clearly forbidden to be\neither trenched or walled by a Pythia skilled in trimeter tone, who\nseems to have been a lady of exceptionally clear conservatism.\n\nThe prince, as the sage of the neighbourhood, knew all about this\nprohibition, and that it was still in force, and must have acquired\ntwenty-fold power by the lapse of twenty centuries; and as the sea\nhad retreated a little during that short period, it was evident that\nJove had been consistent in the matter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe never meant it for an\nisland, else he would have made it one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Agasicles therefore felt\nsome doubt about the piety of his proceeding, retaining as he did, in\ncommon with his neighbours, some respect for the classic gods. His\nrespect, however, for the stars was deeper, and these told him that\nyoung Artemise was likely to be run away with by some bold adventurer.\nA peninsula was the very thing to suit his purpose, and none could\nbe fairer or snugger than this of his own, the very site of ancient\nCnidos, whereof Venus once was queen.\n\nUndeterred by this local affection, or even the warnings of Delphi,\nthe learned prince exerted himself, and by means of a tidy hedge of\npaliure and aspalathus made the five stades of isthmus proof against\neven thick-trousered gentlemen, _a fortiori_ against the natives all\nunendowed with pantaloons. Neither might his fence be leaped by any of\nthe roving horsemen--Turks, Cilicians, Pamphylians, Karamanians, or\nreavers from the chain of Taurus.\n\nThis being fixed to his satisfaction, with a couple of sentries at the\ngate, and one at either end, prompt with matchlocks, and above all,\nthe young lady inside provided with many proverbs, Prince Agasicles\nset forth on a visit to an Armenian sage, reputed to be as wise as\nhimself almost. With him he discussed Alhasen, Vitellio, and their own\ncontemporary, Kepler, and spent so many hours aloft, that on his return\nto his native place he discovered his own little oversight. This was so\nvery simple that it required at least a sage and great philosopher to\ncommit it. The learned man appears to have forgotten that the sea is\nnavigable. So it chanced that a gay young Englishman, cruising about in\nan armed speronera, among the \u00c3\u0086g\u00c3\u00a6an islands, and now in the Carpathian\nsea, hunting after pirates, heard of this Eastern Cynosure, and her\nwalled seclusion. This of course was enough for him. Landing under the\npromontory where the Cnidian Venus stood, he fell, and falling dragged\nanother, into the wild maze of love.\n\nMazed they seemed of course, and nearly mad no doubt to other folk. To\nthemselves, however, they were in a new world altogether, far above the\nlevel and the intellect of the common world. Artemise forgot her pride,\nher proverbs, and pretensions; she had lost her own way in the regions\nof a higher life; and nothing to her was the same as it had been but\nyesterday. Heart and soul, and height and depth, she trusted herself to\nthe Englishman, and even left her jewels.\n\nTherefore they two launched their bark upon the unknown waters; the\ndamsel with her heart in tempest of the filial duties shattered, and\nthe fatherland cast off, yet for the main part anchored firmly on the\ngallant fluke of love; the youth in a hurry to fight a giant, if it\nwould elevate him to her.\n\nArtemise, with all her rashness, fared much better than she deserved\nfor leaving an adoring father the wrong side of the quickset hedge. The\nbold young mariner happened to be a certain Hilary Lorraine, heir of\nthat old house or castle in the Southdown coombe. Possessed with the\nadventurous spirit of his uncles, the famous Shirley brothers, he had\nsailed with Raleigh, and made havoc here and there, and seen almost as\nmuch of the world as was good for himself or it.\n\nEnlarged by travel, he was enabled to suppress rude curiosity about\nthe wishes of the absent prince; and deferring to a better season\nthe pleasure of his acquaintance, he made all sail with the daughter\non board, as set forth already; and those two were made into one,\naccording to the rites of the old Greek Church, in the classic shades\nof Ida. And to their dying day it never repented either of them--much.\n\nWhen the prince returned, and found no daughter left to meet him, he\nfailed for a short time to display that self-command upon which he had\nfor years been wont to plume himself. But having improved his condition\nof mind by a generous bastinado of servants, peasants, and matchlock\nmen, he found himself reasonably remounting into the sphere of pure\nintellect. In a night or two an interesting conjunction of heavenly\nbodies happened, and eclipsed this nebulous world of women.\n\nIn a few years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time he began to get presents, eatable, drinkable, and\ngood. Gradually thus he showed his wisdom, by foregoing petty wrath;\nand when he was summoned to meet a star, militant to his grandson, he\ncould not help ordering his horse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTHE LEGEND CONTINUED.\n\n\nAlthough this prince knew so much more of the heaven above than the\nearth beneath, he did not quite expect to ride the whole of the way\nto England. At Smyrna he took ship, and after some difficulties\nand dangers, landed at Shoreham, full of joy to behold his four\ngrandchildren, who proved to be five by the time he saw them. The\nSussex roads were as bad as need be, and worse than could be anywhere\nelse; but the sturdy oxen set their necks to drag through all things,\nthick or thin; and the prince stuck fast to his coach, as firmly as\nthe coach stuck fast with him. Having never seen any roads before, he\nthought them a wonderful institution, and though misled by the light of\nnature to grumble at some of his worst upsets, a little reflection led\nhim softly back into contentment. A mind \u00e2\u0080\u009cirretrievably analytic\u00e2\u0080\u009d at\nonce distinguished wisdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s element in the Sussex reasoners.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGin us made thase hyur radds gooder, volk \u00e2\u0080\u0099ood be radin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 down droo\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099em avery dai, a\u00e2\u0080\u0099most! The Lard in heaven never made radds as cud ever\nbaide the work, if stranngers cud goo along, wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099out bin vorced to zit\ndown, and mend \u00e2\u0080\u0099un.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen this was interpreted to his Highness, he was so struck with its\nclear sound sense, and logical sequence, that he fell back, and for\nthe rest of his journey admired the grandeur of English character.\nThis sentiment, so deeply founded, was not likely to be impaired by\nfurther acquaintance with our great nation. For more than a twelvemonth\nPrince Agasicles made his home in England, and many of his quaint\nremarks abode on Sussex shepherds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tongues for generations afterwards,\nrecommended as they were by the vantage of princely wisdom. For he\npicked up quite enough of the language to say odd things as a child\ndoes, and with a like simplicity. With this difference, however,\nthat while the great hits of the little ones, by the proud mother\nchronicled, are the lucky outbursts of happy inexperience, the old\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sage words were the issue of unhappy experience.\n\nNevertheless he must have owned a genial nature still at work. For\nhe loved to go down the village lane, when the wind was cold on the\nhighland, and there to wait at a cottage door, till the children came\nto stare at him. And soon these children had courage to spy that,\nin spite of his outlandish dress, pockets were about him, and they\nwhispered as much to one another, while their eyes were testing him. At\nother times when the wind was soft, and shadows of gentle clouds were\nshed in chase of one another, this great man who had seen the world,\nand knew all the stars hanging over it--his pleasure was to wander in\nand out of the ups and downs and nooks of quaintly-plaited hills, and\nfeast his eyes upon their verdure. After that, when the westering light\nwas spreading the upland ridge with gold, and the glades with grey\nsolemnity, this man of declining years was well content to lean on a\nbank of turf, and watch the quiet ways of sheep. Often thus his mind\nwas carried back to the land of childhood, soothed as in his nurse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\narms by nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peace around him. And if his dreams were interrupted\nby the crisp fresh sound of browsing, and the ovine tricks as bright\nas any human exploits, he would turn and do his best to talk with the\nlonely shepherds.\n\nThese, in their simple way, amused him, with their homely saws, and\nstrange content, and independence: and he no less delighted them by\nunaccustomed modes of speech, and turns of thought beyond their minds,\nand distant wisdom quite brought home. Thus, and by many other means,\nthis ancient prince, of noble presence, and of flowing snow-white hair,\nand vesture undisgraced by tailors, left such trace upon these hills,\nthat even his ghost was well believed to know all the sheep-tracks\nafterwards.\n\nPleased with England, and with English scenery and customs, as well as\ncharmed with having five quite baby stars to ephemerise, this great\nastrologer settled to stay in our country as long as possible. He\nsent his trusty servant, Memel, in a merchant-ship from Shoreham to\nfetch his implements and papers, precious things of many kinds, and\ncuriosities long in store. Memel brought all these quite safe, except\none little thing or two, which he accounted trifles; but his master was\ngreatly vexed about them.\n\nThe prince unpacked his goods most carefully in his own eight-sided\nroom, allowing none but his daughter to help him, and not too sure\nabout trusting her. Then forth he set for a real campaign among the\nstars of the Southdowns--and supper-call and breakfast-bell were no\nmore than the bark of a dog to him. And thus he spent his nights, alas!\nforgetful of the different clime, under the cold stars, when by rights\nhe should have been under the counterpane.\n\nThis grew worse and worse, until towards the middle of the month\nof June, A.D. 1611, his mind was altogether much above the proper\ntemperature. Great things were pending in the heavens, which might be\nquoted as pious excuse for a little human restlessness. The prince,\nwith his implements always ready either in his lantern-chamber, or at\nhis favourite spot of the hills, according to the weather, grew more\nand more impatient daily for the sun to be out of the way, and more\nand more intolerant every night of any cloudiness. Self-perplexed,\ndowncast, and moody (except when for a few brief hours a brighter\ncanopy changed his gloom into a nervous rapture), he wasted and waned\naway in body, as his mind grew brighter. After the hurried night, he\ndragged his faint way home in the morning, and his face of exhausted\npower struck awe into the household. No one dared to ask him what had\nhappened, or why he looked so; and he like a true philosopher kept all\nexplanations to himself. And then he started anew, and strode with his\nSamian cloak around him, over the highest, darkest, and most lonesome\nhill, out of people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sight.\n\nOne place there was which beyond all others suited his purposes and\nhis mood. A well-known land-mark now, and the scene of many a merry\npicnic, Chanctonbury Ring was then a lonely spot imbued with terror\nof a wandering ghost,--an ancient ghost with a long white beard\nwalking even in the afternoon, with its head bowed down in search of\nsomething--a vain search of centuries. This long-sought treasure has\nnow been found; not by the ghost, however, but a lucky stroke of the\nploughshare; and the spectral owner roves no more. He is supposed, with\nall the assumption required to make a certainty, to have been a tenant\non Chancton Manor, under Earl Gurth, the brother of Harold, and being\nslain at Hastings, to have forgotten where his treasure lay.\n\nThe Ring, as of old, is a height of vantage for searching all the\ncountry round with a telescope on a breezy day. It is the salient\npoint and foreland of a long ridge of naked hills, crowned with darker\neminence by a circle of storm-huddled trees. But when the astrologer\nAgasicles made his principal night-haunt here, the Ring was not\noverhung with trees, but only outlined by them; and the rampart of the\nBritish camp (if such it were) was more distinct, and uninvaded by\nplanters. So that here was the very place for a quiet sage to make his\nhome, sweeping a long horizon and secure from interruption. To such a\ncitadel of science, guarded by the fame of ghosts, even his daughter\nArtemise, or his trusty servant Memel, would scarce dare to follow him;\nmuch less any of the peasants, who, from the lowland, seeing a distant\nlight, crossed themselves; for that fine old custom flourished still\namong them. Therefore, here his tent was pitched, and here he spent the\nnights in gazing, and often the days in computation, not for himself,\nbut for his descendants; until his frame began to waste, and his great\ndark eyes grew pale with it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE LEGEND CONCLUDED.\n\n\nArtemise, and all around the prince, had been alarmed of late by many\nlittle symptoms. He always had been rashly given to take no heed of his\nfood or clothes; but now he went beyond all that, and would have no one\ntake heed for him, or dare to speak of the matter much. Hence, without\nlistening to any nonsense, all the women were sure of one thing--the\nprince was wearing himself away.\n\nThe country people who knew him, and loved him with a little mystery,\nsaid it was no wonder that he should worry himself, for being so long\naway from home, in manners, and in places also. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure it must be a\ntrial for him; out all night in the damp and fog; and he no sense of\nbreeches!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was much of truth in this, no doubt, as well as much outside it.\nYet none of them could enter into his peculiar state of mind. So that\nhe often reproached himself for having been rude, but could not help\nit. Every one made allowance for him, as Englishmen do for a foreigner,\nas being of a somewhat lower order, in many ways, in creation. Yet with\na mixture of mind about it, they admired him more and more.\n\nThe largeness of his nature still was very conspicuous in this,--he\nnever brought his telescope to bear on his own planet. His heart was\nreaching so far forward into future ages, that he strove to follow\ndownwards nine or ten entails of stars. To know what was to become of\nall that were to be descended from him; a highly interesting, but also\na deeply exhausting question. This perpetual effort told very hard\nupon his constitution, for nothing less than fatal worry could have so\nimpaired his native grace and lofty courtesy.\n\nYet before his sudden end, a softer and more genial star was culminant\none evening. When one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time comes to be certain--whether by earthly\nsenses, or by influence of heaven--of the buoyant balance turning,\nand the slender span outspun, tender thinkings, and kind wishes,\nflow to the good side of us. Through this power, the petty troubles,\nand the crooked views of life, and the ambition to make others\nbetter than we care to be, and every other little turn of wholesome\nself-deception--these drop off, and leave us sinking into a sense of\nhaving lived, and made a humble thing of it.\n\nWhether this be so or not, upon the 18th day of June in the year 1611,\nPrince Agasicles came home rather hot, and very tired, and fain for\na little sleep, if such there were, to wear out weariness. But still\nhe had heavy work left for that night; as a mighty comet had lately\nappeared, and scared the earth abundantly; yet now he had two or three\nhours to spare, and they might as well be happy ones. Therefore he sent\nfor his daughter to come, and see to his food and such like, and then\nto sit with him some few minutes, and to watch the sunset.\n\nArtemise, still young and lovely, knew of course, from Eastern wisdom,\nthat woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right is to do no wrong. So that she came at once when\ncalled, and felt as a mother ought to feel, that she multiplied her\nobedience vastly, by bringing all her children. Being in a soft state\nof mind, the old man was glad to see them all, and let them play with\nhim as freely as childhood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awe of white hair allowed. Then he laid\nhis hand upon Roger, the heir of the house, and blessed him on his\nway to bed; and after that he took his supper, waited on by Artemise,\nwho was very grateful for his kindness to her children. So that she\nbrought him the right thing, exactly at the right moment, without\novercrowding him; and then she poured him sparkling wine, and comforted\nhis weary feet, and gave him a delicious pipe of Persian meconopsis,\nfree from the bane of opium, yet more dreamy than tobacco. Also she\nsprinkled round him delicate attar of the Vervain (sprightlier and less\noppressive than the scent of roses), until his white beard ceased to\nflutter, and the strong lines of his face relaxed into soft drowsiness.\n\nObserving thence the proper time when sweet sleep was encroaching, and\nhaste, and heat, and sudden temper were as far away as can be from a\nman of Eastern blood, Artemise, his daughter, touched him with the\nsmile which he used to love, when she was two years old and upward; and\nhis thoughts without his knowledge flew back to her mother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFather to me, father dearest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she was whispering to him, in the\nnative tongue which charms the old, as having lulled their cradles;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfather to me, tell what trouble has together fallen on you in this\ncold and foreign land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMelody enough was still remaining, in the most melodious of all mortal\nlanguages, for a child to move a father into softer memories, at the\nsound of ancient music thus revived, and left to dwell.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChild of my breast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the prince replied, in the very best modern\nHellenic, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca strong desire to sleep again hath overcome mine intellect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus is it the more suited, father, for discourse with such as mine.\nLet your little one share the troubles of paternal wisdom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSuasion more than this was needed, and at every stage forthcoming, more\nskilfully than English words or even looks could render, ere ever the\npaternal wisdom might be coaxed to unfold itself; and even so it was\nnot disposed to be altogether explicit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAsk me no more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last; \u00e2\u0080\u009cenough that I foresee great\ntroubles overhanging this sad house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, father, when, and how, and what? How shall we get over them, and\nwhy should we encounter them? And will my husband or my children----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe prince put up one finger as if to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAsk one thing at a time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nthe while he ceased not to revolve many and sad counsels in his\nvenerable head; and in his gaze deep pity mingled with a father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pride\nand love. Then he spoke three words in a language which she did not\ncomprehend, but retained their sound, and learned before her death that\nthey meant this--\u00e2\u0080\u009cKnowledge of trouble trebles it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow best-loved father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed, perceiving that his face was\nset to tell her very little, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbehold how many helpless ones depend upon\nmy knowledge of the evils I must shield them from. It is--nay, by your\neyes--it is the little daughter whom you always cherished with such\nlove and care, who now is the cause of a mind perplexed, as often she\nhas been to you. Father, let not our affairs lay such burden on your\nmind, but spread them out and lighten it. Often, as our saying hath it,\noftentimes the ear of folly is the purse for wisdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hesitate not, I doubt no longer. I do not divide my mind in twain.\nThe wisdom of them that come after me carries off and transcends mine\nown, as a mountain doth a half-peck basket. Wherefore, my daughter,\nArtemise, wife of the noble Englishman with whom she ran away from\nCaria, and mother of my five grandchildren, she is worthy to know all\nthat I have learned from heaven; ay, and she shall know it all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFather to me dearest, yes! Oh, how noble and good of you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe shall know all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the prince, with a gaze of ingenuous\nconfidence, and counting on his fingers slowly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit may be sooner, or\nit may be later; however, I think one may safely promise a brilliant\nknowledge of everything in five years after we have completed the\nsecond century from this day. But now the great comet is waiting for\nme. Let me have my boots again. Uncouth, barbarous, frightful things!\nBut in such a country needful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis daughter obeyed without a word, and hid her disappointment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nis only to wait till to-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand then to fill him a\nlarger pipe, and coax him a little more perhaps, and pour him more wine\nof Burgundy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo-morrow never came for him, except in the way the stars come. In the\nmorning he was missed, and sought for, and found dead and cold at the\nend of his longest telescope. In Chanctonbury Ring he died, and must\nhave known, for at least a moment, that his death was over him; for\namong the stars of his jotting-chart was traced, in trembling charcoal,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSepeli, ubi cecidi\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBury me where I have fallen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nASTROLOGICAL FORECAST.\n\n\nAlice Lorraine, with no small excitement, heard from her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips\nthis story of their common ancestor. Part of it was already known to\nher through traditions of the country; but this was the first time the\nwhole had been put into a connected narrative. She wondered, also, what\nher father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reason could be for thus recounting to her this piece of\nfamily history, which had never been (as she felt quite sure) confided\nto her brother Hilary; and, like a young girl, she was saying to\nherself as he went on--\u00e2\u0080\u009cShall I ever be fit to compare with that lovely\nArtemise, my ever-so-long-back grandmother, as the village people call\nit? and will that fine old astrologer see that the stars do their duty\nto us? and was the great comet that killed him the one that frightens\nme every night so? and why did he make such a point of dying without\nexplaining anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever, what she asked her father was a different question from all\nthese.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, papa, how kind of you to tell me all that story! But what became\nof Artemise----\u00e2\u0080\u0098Lady Lorraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I suppose she was?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my dear; \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mistress Lorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098Madame Lorraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perhaps they\ncalled her. The old earldom had long been lost, and Roger, her son,\nwho fell at Naseby, was the first baronet of our family. But as\nfor Artemise herself--the daughter of the astrologer, and wife of\nHilary Lorraine, she died at the birth of her next infant, within a\ntwelvemonth after her father; and then it was known why he had been so\nreluctant to tell her anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I am so sorry for her! Then she is that beautiful creature hanging\nthird from the door in the gallery, with ruches beautifully picked out\nand glossy, and wonderful gold lace on her head, and long hair, and\nlovely emeralds hanging down as if they were nothing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland, smiling at his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style of description,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat of course is the lady; and the portrait is clearly a likeness. At\none time we thought of naming you after her--\u00e2\u0080\u0098Artemise Lorraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099--for\nyour nurse discovered that you were like her at the mature age of three\ndays.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, papa, how I wish you had! It would have sounded so much nicer, and\nso beautifully romantic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust so, my child; and therefore, in these matter-of-fact times, so\ndeliciously absurd. Moreover, I hope that you will not be like her,\neither in running away from your father, or in any other way--except\nher kindness and faithfulness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was going to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin her early death;\u00e2\u0080\u009d but a sudden touch of our\nnatural superstition stopped him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, how dare you speak as if any one ever, in all the world, could\nbe fit to compare with you? But now you must tell me one little\nthing--why have you chosen this very day, which ought to be such a\nhappy one, for telling me so sad a tale, that a little more would have\nmade me cry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reason, my Lallie, is simple enough. This happens to be the very\nday when the two hundred years are over; and the astrologer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will, or\nwhatever the document is, may now be opened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis will, papa! Did he leave a will? And none of us ever heard of it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear, your acquaintance with his character is, perhaps, not\nexhaustive. He may have left many wills without wishing to have them\npublished; at any rate, you shall have the chance, before it grows\ndark, to see what there is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMe! or I--whichever is right?--me, or I, to do such a thing! Papa,\nwhen I was six years old I could stand on my head; but now I have lost\nthe art, alas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Alice, do try to be sensible, if you ever had such an opening.\nYou know that I do not very often act rashly; but you will make me\nthink I have done so now, unless you behave most steadily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, I am steadiness itself; but you must make allowance for a little\nupset at the marvels heaped upon me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear child, there are no marvels; or, at any rate, none for you to\nknow. All you have to do is to go, and to fetch a certain document.\nWhether you know any more about it, is a question for me to consider.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, papa--to raise me up so, and to cast me down like that! And I was\ngiving you credit for having trusted me so entirely! And very likely\nyou would not even have sent me for this document, if you had your own\nway about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered, smiling at her knowledge of him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nhappen to be particularly right in that conjecture. I should never\nhave thought of sending you to a lonely and forsaken place, if I were\nallowed to send any one else, or to go myself. And I have not been\nhappy at thinking about it, ever since the morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father, do you think that I could help rejoicing in such an errand?\nIt is the very thing to suit me. Where are the keys, papa? Do be quick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no intention, my dear child, of hurrying either you or myself.\nThere is plenty of time to think of all things. The sun has not set,\nand that happens to be one of the little things we have to look to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, how very delightful, papa! That makes it so much more beautiful.\nAnd it is the astrologer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room, of course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear, it strikes me that you look rather pale, in the midst of all\nyour transports. Now, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go if you are at all afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfraid, papa! Now you want to provoke me. You quite forget both my\nage, it appears, and the family I belong to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy pet, you never allow us to be very long forgetful of either of\nthose great facts; but I trust I have borne them both duly in mind, and\nI fear that I should even enhance, most needlessly, your self-esteem,\nif I were to read you the directions which I now am following. For,\nstrangely enough, they do contain predictions as to your character such\nas we cannot yet perceive (much as we love you) to have come to pass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, but who are the \u00e2\u0080\u0098we,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 papa? If everybody knows it--even\ngrandmamma, for instance--what pleasure can I hope to find in ever\nhaving been predicted?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may enjoy that pleasure, Alice, as exclusively as you please. Even\nyour grandmother knows nothing of the matter we have now in hand; or\nelse--at least I should say perhaps that, if it were otherwise----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe would have been down here, of course, papa, and have marched up\nto the room herself; but, if the whole thing belongs to one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self,\nnothing can be more delightful than to have been predicted, especially\nin glowing terms, such as I beg you now, papa, to read in glowing tones\nto me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice, I do not like that style of--what shall I call it?--on your\npart. _Persiflage_, I believe, is the word; and I am glad that there\nis no English one. It is never graceful in any woman, still less in a\nyoung girl like you. Hilary brought it from Oxford first: and perhaps\nhe thought it excellent. Lay it aside now, once and for all. It hopes\nto seem a clever thing, and it does not even succeed in that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt these severe words, spoken with a decided attempt at severity, Alice\nfell back, and could only drop her eyes, and wonder what could have\nmade her father so cross upon his birthday. But, after the smart of the\nmoment, she began to acknowledge to herself that her father was right,\nand she was wrong. This flippant style was foreign to her, and its\ncharms must be foregone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon, father dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, looking softly up at him;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that I am not clever, and I never meant to seem so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite right, Alice; never attempt to do anything impossible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Saying\nthis to her, Sir Roland said to himself that, after all, he should like\nto know very much where to find any girl half so clever as Lallie, or\nany girl even a quarter so good, and so loving, and so beautiful.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sun is almost gone behind the curve of the hill, and the scrubby\nbeech, and the nick cut in the gorsebush. Alice, you know we only see\nit for just the Midsummer week like that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlice came, with her eyes already quit of every trace of tears; with\nvanity and all petty feelings melting into larger thought. The beauty\nof the world would often come around and overcome her, so that she felt\nnothing else.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sun must always be the same,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland said, rather doubtfully,\nafter waiting for Alice to begin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt he must always be the\nsame; but still the great Herschel seems to think that even the sun is\nchanging. If he is fed by comets (as our old astronomers used to say),\nhe ought to be doing very well just now. Alice, the sun is above ground\nstill, for people on the hill-top, and there is the comet already\nkindling!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course he is, papa; he never waits for the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convenience. But\nI must not say that--I forgot. There would be no English name for\nit--would there now, papa?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou little tyrant, what troubles I would inflict upon you if I studied\nthe stars! But I scarcely know the belt of Orion from the Northern\nCrown. Astronomy does not appear to have taken deep root in our family;\nbut look, there is part of the sun again emerging under Chancton! In\nfive minutes more he will be quite gone; now is the time for me to read\nthese queer directions, which contain so poetical an account of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlice, warned by his former words, and reduced to proper humility, did\nnot speak while her father opened the small strip of parchment, at\nwhich she had so long been peeping curiously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is written in Latin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand has been handed from\nfather to son unsealed, and as you see it, from the time of the prince\ntill our time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I see it, papa? What a very clear hand! but you must translate it\nfor me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen here it is:--\u00e2\u0080\u0098To the father and master of the family of Lorraine,\nwhoever shall be in the year, according to Christian computation, 1811,\nAgasicles Syennesis, the Carian, bids hail. Do thou, on the 18th day\nof June, when the sun has well descended, or departed\u00e2\u0080\u0099--_decesserit_,\nthe word is--\u00e2\u0080\u0098send thy eldest daughter, without any companion, to the\nastronomer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _c\u00c5\u0093naculum_\u00e2\u0080\u0099--why, he never ate supper, the poor old\nfellow, unless it was the one he died of--\u00e2\u0080\u0098and there let her search\nin a closet or cupboard\u00e2\u0080\u0099--_in secessu muri_, the words are, as far as\nI can make out--\u00e2\u0080\u0098and she will find a small document, which to me has\nbeen in great price. There will also be something else, to be treated\n_pro re nata_\u00e2\u0080\u0099--that means according to circumstances--\u00e2\u0080\u0098and according\nto the orders in the document aforesaid. The virgin will be brave, and\nbeautiful, ready to give herself for the house, and of swiftly-growing\nprudence. If there be no such virgin then the need for her will not\nhave arisen. It is necessary that no young man should go, and my\ndocument must lie hidden for another century. It is not possible that\nany one of uncertain skill should be certain. But there ought to be a\ngreat comet also burning in the sky, of the same complexion as the one\nthat makes my calculations doubtful. Farewell, whosoever thou shalt be,\nfrom me descended, and obey me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, I declare it quite frightens me. How could he have predicted me,\nfor instance, and this great comet, and even you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you think that you answer to your description! My darling, I do\nbelieve that you do. But you never shall \u00e2\u0080\u0098give yourself for the house,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nor for fifty thousand houses. Now, will you have anything to do with\nthis strange affair; or will you not? Much rather would I hear you say\nthat you will have nothing to do with it, and that the old man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book\nmay sleep for at least another century.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, papa, you know how much you would be disappointed in me. And do\nyou think that I could have any self-respect remaining? And beside all\nthat, how could I hope to sleep in my bed with all those secrets ever\ndangling over me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat last is a very important point. With your excitable nature, you\nhad better go always through a thing. It was the same with your dear\nmother. Here are the keys, my daughter. I really feel ashamed to dwell\nso long on a mere superstition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE LEGACY OF THE ASTROLOGER.\n\n\nThe room known as the Astrologer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (by the maids, less reverently\nentitled the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstar-gazer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closet\u00e2\u0080\u009d) was that old eight-sided, or\nlantern-chamber, which has been mentioned in the short account of the\nCarian sage and his labours. He had used it alternately, with his other\nquarters in the Chancton Ring; for this had outlook of the rising, as\nthe other had of the setting stars. At the eastern end of the house, it\nstood away from roofs and chimney-tops, commanding the trending face of\nhill, and the amplitude of the world below, from north-west round the\nnorth and east, to the rising point of Fomalhault.\n\nTo this room Alice now made her way, as if she had no time to spare.\nWith quick, light steps she passed through the hall, and then the\npainted library, as it was called from some old stained glass--and\nat the further end she entered a little room with double doors, her\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favourite musing-place. In the eastern end of this quiet\nchamber, and at the eastern end of all, there was a low and narrow\ndoor. This was seldom locked, because none of the few who came so far\nwould care to go any further. For it opened to a small landing-place,\ndimly lit, as well as damp, and leading to a newel staircase, narrow,\nand made of a chalky flint, angular and irregular.\n\nAlice stopped to think a little. All things looked so uninviting\nthat she would rather keep her distance. Surely now that the sun had\ndeparted--whether well or otherwise--some other time would do as nicely\nfor going on with the business. There was nothing said of any special\nhurry, so far as she could remember; and what could be a more stupid\nthing than to try to unlock an ancient door without any light for the\nkeyhole? She had a very great mind to go back, and to come again in the\nmorning.\n\nShe turned with a quick turn towards the light, and the comfort, and\nthe company; then suddenly she remembered how she had boasted of her\ncourage; and who would be waiting to laugh at her, if she came back\nwithout her errand. Fearing further thought, she ran like a sunset\ncloud up the stairway.\n\nFifty or sixty steps went by her before she had time to think of them;\na few in the light of loopholes, but the greater part in governed\ngloom, or shadowy mixture flickering. Then at the top she stopped to\nbreathe, and recover her wits, for a moment. Here a long black door\nrepelled her--a door whose outside she knew pretty well, but had no\nidea of the other side. Upon this, she began to think again; and her\nthoughts were almost too much for her.\n\nWith a little sigh that would have moved all imaginable enemies, the\nswiftly sensitive girl called up the inborn spirit of her race, and her\nown peculiar romance. These in combination scarcely could have availed\nher to turn the key, unless her father had happened to think of oiling\nit with a white pigeon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feather.\n\nWhen she heard the bolt shoot back, she made the best of a bad affair.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn for a penny, in for a pound;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cfaint heart is fain;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo bites at\na cherry;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and above all, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnoblesse oblige.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With all these thoughts to\npress her forward, in she walked, quite dauntlessly.\n\nAnd lo, there was nothing to frighten her. Everything looked as old and\nharmless as the man who had loved them all; having made or befriended\nthem. His own little lathe, with its metal bed (cast by himself from\na mixture of his own, defying the rust of centuries), wanted nothing\nmore than dusting, and some oil on the bearings. And the speculum he\nhad worked so hard at, for a reflecting telescope--partly his own\nidea, and partly reflected (as all ideas are) some years ere the time\nof Gregory--the error in its grinding, which had driven him often to\ndespair, might still be traced by an accurate eye through the depth of\ntwo hundred dusty years. Models, patterns, moulds, and castings,--many\nof which would have shown how slowly our boasted discoveries have\ngrown,--also favourite tools, and sundry things past out of their\nmeaning, lay about among their fellows, doomed alike to do no work,\nbecause the man who had kept them moving was shorter-lived than they\nwere.\n\nNow young Alice stood among them, in a reverential way. They were, of\ncourse, no more than other things laid by to rust, according to man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nconvenience. And yet she could not make up her mind to meddle with any\none of them. So that she only looked about, and began to be at home\nwith things.\n\nHer eager mind was always ready to be crowded with a rash young\ninterest in all things. It was the great fault of her nature that she\nnever could perceive how very far all little things should lie beneath\nher notice. So that she now had really more than she could contrive to\ntake in all at once.\n\nBut while she stood in this surprise, almost forgetting her errand\namong the multitude of ideas, a cloud above the sunset happened to be\npacked with gorgeous light. Unbosoming itself to the air in the usual\ncloudy manner, it managed thereby to shed down some bright memories of\nthe departed one. And hence there came a lovely gleam of daylight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nafterthought into the north-western facet of the old eight-sided room.\nAlice crossed this glance of sunset, wondering what she was to do,\nuntil she saw her shadow wavering into a recess of wall. There, between\nthe darker windows to the right hand of the door, a little hover of\nrefraction, striking upon reflection, because it was fugitive, caught\nher eyes. She saw by means of this a keyhole in a brightened surface,\non a heavy turn of wall that seemed to have no meaning. In right of\ndiscovery up she ran, passed her fingers over a plate of polished\nSussex iron, and put her key into the hole, of course.\n\nThe lock had been properly oiled perhaps, and put into working order\nsometimes, even within the last hundred years. But still it was so\nstiff that Alice had to work the key both ways, and with both hands,\nere it turned. And even after the bolt went back, she could not open\nthe door at once, perhaps because the jamb was rusty, or the upper\nhinge had given forward. Whatever the hesitation was, the girl would\nhave no refusal. She set the key crosswise in the lock, and drew one\ncorner of her linen handkerchief through the loop of it, and then tied\na knot, and, with both hands, pulled. Inasmuch as her handkerchief\nwas not made of gauze, or lace, or gossamer, and herself of no feeble\nmaterial, the heavy door gave way at last, and everything lay before\nher.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that all? oh, is that all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried in breathless disappointment,\nand yet laughing at herself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo jewels, no pearls, no brooches, or\nbuckles, or even a gold watch! And the great Astrologer must have\nforeseen how sadly, in this year of our reckoning, I should be longing\nfor a gold watch! Alas! without it, what is the use of being \u00e2\u0080\u0098brave and\nbeautiful\u00e2\u0080\u0099? Here is nothing more than dust, mouldy old deeds, and a\ndirty cushion!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlice had a great mind at first to run back to her father and tell\nhim that, after all, there was nothing found that would be worth the\ncarrying. And she even turned, and looked round the room, to support\nthis strong conclusion. But the weight of ancient wisdom (pressed on\nthe young imagination by the stamp of mystery) held her under, and made\nher stop from thinking her own thoughts about it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe must have known\nbetter, of course, than I do. Only look at his clever tools! I am sure\nI could live in this room for a week, and never be afraid of anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut even while she was saying this to herself, with the mind in command\nof the heart, and a fine conscientious courage, there came to her ears,\nor seemed to come, a quiet, low, unaccountable sound. It may have\nbeen nothing, as she tried to think, when first she began to recover\nherself; or it may have been something, quite harmless, and most easily\ntraced to its origin. But whatever it was, in a moment it managed to\nquench her desire to live in that room. With quick hands, now delivered\nfrom their usual keen sense of grime, she snatched up whatever she saw\nin the cupboard, and banged the iron door and locked it, with a glance\nof defiant terror over the safer shoulder first, and then over the one\nthat was nearer the noise.\n\nThen she knew that she had done her duty very bravely; and that it\nwould be a cruel thing to expect her to stay any longer. And, so to\nshut out all further views of anything she had no right to see, she\nslipped back the band of her beautiful hair, and, under that cover,\nretreated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nA BOY AND A DONKEY.\n\n\nAt this very time there happened to be a boy of no rank, and of unknown\norder, quietly jogging homeward. He differed but little from other\nboys; and seemed unworthy of consideration, unless one stopped to\nconsider him. Because he was a boy by no means virtuous, or valiant,\nneither gifted by nature with any inborn way to be wonderful. Having\nnothing to help him much, he lived among the things that came around\nhim, to his very utmost; and he never refused a bit to eat, because it\nmight have been a better bit. And now and then, if he got the chance\n(without any more in the background than a distant view of detection),\nhe had been imagined perhaps to lay hand upon a stray trifle that would\nlie about, and was due, but not paid, to his merits. Nobody knew where\nthis boy came from, or whether he came at all indeed, or was only the\nproduce of earth or sky, at some improper conjuncture. Nothing was\ncertain about him; except that there he was; and he meant to stay; and\npeople, for the most part, liked him. And many women would been glad\nto love him, in a protective way, but for the fright by all of them\nfelt, by reason of the magistrates.\n\nThese had settled it long ago, at every kind of session, that this boy\n(though so comparatively honest) must not be encouraged much. He had\nsuch a manner of looking about, after almost anything; and of making\nthe most of those happy times when luck embraces art; above all, he\nhad such exhaustive knowledge of apple-trees, and potato-buries, and\ncows that wanted milking, as well as of ticklish trout, and occasional\nlittle ducks that had lost their way--that after long-tried lenience,\nand allowance for such a neglected child, justice could no longer take\na large and loving view of \u00e2\u0080\u009cBonny.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBonny held small heed of justice (even in the plural number) whenever\nhe could help it. The nature of his birth and nurture had been such as\nto gift him with an outside view of everything. If people liked him, he\nliked them, and would be the last to steal from them; or at any rate\nwould let them be the last for him to steal from. His inner meaning was\nso honest, that he almost always waited for some great wrong to be done\nto him, before he dreamed of making free with almost anybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ducks.\n\nWidely as he was known, and often glanced at from a wrong point of\nview, even his lowest detractor could not give his etymology. Many\nattempted to hold that he might have been called, in some generative\noutburst, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBonnie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by a Scotchman of imagination. Others laughed this\nidea to scorn, and were sure that his right name was \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoney,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because\nof his living in spite of all terror of \u00e2\u0080\u009cBonyparty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the true\nsolution probably was (as with all analytic inquiries) the third,--that\nhis right name was \u00e2\u0080\u009cBony,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because his father, though now quite a\nshadowy being, must have, at some time or other, perhaps, gone about\ncrying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRags and Bones, oh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese little niceties of origin passed by Bonny as the idle wind. He\nwas proud of his name, and it sounded well; and wherever he went, the\nladies seemed to like him as an unknown quantity. Also (which mattered\nfar more to him) the female servants took to him. And, with many of\nthese, he had such a way, that it found him in victuals, perhaps twice\nin a week.\n\nNevertheless, he was forced to work as hard as could be, this summer.\nThe dragging weight of a hopeless war (as all, except the stout\nfarmers, now were beginning to consider it) had been tightening, more\nand more, the strain upon the veins of trade, and the burden of the\ncommunity.\n\nThis good boy lived in the side of a hill, or of a cliff (as some might\ncall it), white and beautiful to look at from a proper distance. Here\nhe had one of those queer old holes, which puzzle the sagest antiquary,\nand set him in fiercest conflict with the even sager geologist. But in\nspite of them all, the hole was there; and in that hole lived Bonny.\n\nWithout society, what is life? Our tenderest and truest affections\nwere not given us for naught. The grandest of human desires is to have\nsomething or other to wallop; and fate (in small matters so hard upon\nBonny) had known when to yield, and had granted him this; that is to\nsay, a donkey.\n\nA donkey of such a clever kind, and so set up with reasoning powers\nand a fine heart of his own, that all his conclusions were almost\nright, until they were beaten out of him. His name was \u00e2\u0080\u009cJack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his\nnature was of a level and sturdy order, resenting wrongs, accepting\nfavours, with all the teeth of gratitude, and braying (as all clever\nasses do) at every change of weather. His personal appearance also was\nnoble, striking, and romantic; and his face reminded all beholders of a\nwell-coloured pipe-bowl upside down. For all his muzzle and nose were\nwhite, as snowy white as if he always wore a nosebag newly floured from\nthe nearest windmill. But just below his eyes, and across the mace of\nhis jaws, was a ring of brown, and above that not a speck of white,\nbut deepening into cloudy blackness, throughout all his system. Then\n(like the crest of Hector) rose a menacing frontlet of thick hair, and\nwarlike ears as long as horns, yet genially revolving; and body and\nlegs, to complete the effect, conceived in the very best taste to match.\n\nThese great virtues of the animal found their balance in small\nfoibles. A narrow-minded, self-seeking vein, a too vindictive memory,\nan obstinacy more than asinine, no sense of honour, and a habit of\ntreating too many questions with the teeth or heels. These had lowered\nhim to his present rank; as may be shown hereafter.\n\nTo any worked and troubled mind, escaping into the country, it would\nhave been a treat to happen (round some corner suddenly, when the sun\nthrows shadows long) upon Bonny and his jackass. In the ripe time\nof the evening, when the sun is at his kindest, and the earth most\nthankful, and the lines of every shadow now are well accustomed;\nwhen the air has summer hope of never feeling frost again; and every\nbush, and tump, and hillock quite knows how to stand and look; when\nthe creases of yellow grass, and green grass, by the roadside, leave\nthemselves for explanation, till the rain shall settle it; and the\nthick hedge in the calm air cannot rustle, unless it holds a rabbit\nor a hare at play,--when all these things, in their quiet way, guide\nthe shadowy lines of evening, and the long lanes of farewell, what can\nsoothe the spirit more than the view of a boy on a donkey?\n\nBonny, therefore, was in keeping with the world around him (as he\nalways contrived to be) when he came home on Jack, that evening from\na long day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work at Shoreham. The lane was at its best almost, with\nall the wild flowers that love the chalk, mixed with those that hug\nthe border where the chalk creams into loam. Among them Bonny whistled\nmerrily, as his favourite custom was; to let the Pixies and the\nFairies, ere he came under the gloom of the hill, understand that he\nwas coming and nobody else to frighten them.\n\nSoothed with the beauty of the scene and the majesty of the sunset,\nJack drew back his ears and listened drowsily to his master. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBritannia\nrule the waves\u00e2\u0080\u009d was then the anthem of the nation; and as she seemed to\nrule nothing else, though fighting very grandly, all patriotic Britons\nfound main comfort in commanding water.\n\nThe happiness of this boy and donkey was of that gleeful see-saw\nchancing, which is the heartiest of all. This has a snugness of its\nown, which nothing but poverty can afford, and luck rejoice to revel\nin. As a rich man hugs his shivers, when he has taken a sudden chill,\nand huddles in over a roaring fire, and boasts that he cannot warm\nhimself, so a poor fellow may cuddle his home, and spread his legs as\nhe pleases, for the sake of its very want of comfort, and the things\nit makes him think of; all to be hoped for by-and-by. And Bonny was so\ndestitute, that he had all the world to hope for. He lived in a hole\nin the scarp of chalk, at the foot of the gully of Coombe Lorraine;\nand many of his delightful doings might have been seen from the lofty\nwindows, if anyone ever had thought it worth while to slope a long\ntelescope at him. But nobody cared to look at Bonny and scatter his\nlowly happiness--than which there is no more fugitive creature, and\nnone more shy of inspection.\n\nBeing of a light and dauntless nature, Bonny kept whistling and singing\nhis way, over the grass and through the furze, and in and out the\ndappled leafage of the summer evening; while Jack, with his brightest\nblinkings, picked the parts of the track that suited him. The setting\nsun was in their eyes, and made them wink every now and then, and threw\nthe shadow of long ears, and walking legs, and jogging heads, here\nand there and anywhere. Also a very fine lump of something might in\nthe shadows be loosely taken to hang across Jack in his latter parts,\ncoming after Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs, and choice things stowed in front of them.\n\nThe meaning of this was that they had been making a very lucky\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099long-shore day at the mouth of the river Adur; and on their way home\nhad received some pleasing tribute to their many merits in the town\nof Steyning, and down the road. Jack had no panniers, for his master\ncould not provide such luxuries; but he had what answered as well, or\nbetter--a long and trusty meal-sack, strongly stitched at the mouth,\nand slit for inlet some way down the middle. So that as it hung well\nbalanced over his sturdy quarters, anything might be popped in quickly;\nand all the contents must abide together, and churn up into fine\ntenderness.\n\nAs for Bonny himself, the shadows did him strong injustice, such as he\nwas wont to take from all the world, and make light of. The shadows\nshowed him a ragged figure, flapping and flickering here and there,\nand random in his outlines. But the true glow of the sunset, full upon\nhis face, presented quite another Bonny. No more to be charged as a\nvagabond than the earth and the sun himself were; but a little boy who\nloved his home, such as it was, and knew it, and knew little else.\nDirty, perhaps, just here and there, after the long dry weather--but if\nhe had been ugly, could he have brought home all that dripping?\n\nTo the little fellow himself as yet the question of costume was more\nimportant than that of comeliness. And his dress afforded him many\nsources of pride and self-satisfaction. For his breeches were possessed\nof inexhaustible vitality, as well as bold and original colour, having\nbeen adapted for him by the wife of his great patron, Bottler the\npigman, from a pair of Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leggings, made of his own pigskin.\nThe skin had belonged, in the first place, to a very remarkable boar,\na thorough Calydonian hog, who escaped from a farm-yard, and lived\nfor months a wild life in St. Leonard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Forest. Here he scared all\nthe neighbourhood, until at last Bottler was invoked to arise like\nMeleager, and to bring his pig-knife. Bottler met him in single combat,\nslew him before he had time to grunt, and claiming him as the spoils\nof war, pickled his hams at his leisure. Then he tanned the hide which\nwas so thick that it never would do for cracklings, and made himself\nleggings as everlasting as the fame of his exploit.\n\nWith these was Bonny now endued over most of his nether moiety. Shoes\nand stockings he scorned, of course, but his little shanks were clean\nand red, while his shoulders and chest were lost in the splendour of a\ncoachman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crimson waistcoat. At least they were generally so concealed\nwhen he set forth in the morning, for he picked up plenty of pins, and\nshowed some genius in arranging them; but after a hard day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work,\nas now, air and light would always reassert their right of entrance.\nStill, there remained enough of the mingled charm of blush and plush to\nrecall in soft domestic bosoms bygone scenes, for ever past--but oh, so\nsweet among the trays!\n\nTo judge him, however, without the fallacy of romantic tenderness--the\nbreadth of his mouth, and the turn of his nose, might go a little way\nagainst him. Still, he had such a manner of showing bright white teeth\nin a jocund grin, and of making his frizzly hair stand up, and his\nsharp blue eyes express amazement, at the proper moment; moreover, his\npair of cheeks was such (after coming off the downs), and his laugh\nso dreadfully infectious, and he had such tales to tell--that several\nlofty butlers were persuaded to consider him.\n\nEven the butler of Coombe Lorraine--but that will come better\nhereafter. Only as yet may be fairly said, that Bonny looked up at\nthe house on the hill with a delicate curiosity; and felt that his\novertures might have been somewhat ungraceful, or at least ill-timed,\nwhen the new young footman (just taken on) took it entirely upon\nhimself to kick him all the way down the hill. This little discourtesy,\ndoubling of course Master Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s esteem and regard for the place, at\nthe same time introduced some constraint into his after intercourse.\nFor the moment, indeed, he took no measures to vindicate his honour;\nalthough, at a word (as he knew quite well), Bottler, the pigman, would\nhave brought up his whip and seen to it. And even if any of the maids\nof the house had been told to tell Miss Alice about it, Bonny was sure\nof obtaining justice, and pity, and even half-a-crown.\n\nQuick as he was to forget and forgive the many things done amiss to\nhim, the boy, when he came to the mouth of the coombe, looked pretty\nsharply about him for traces of that dreadful fellow, who had proved\nhimself such a footman. With Jack to help him, with jaw and heel,\nBonny would not have been so very much afraid of even him; such a\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong-siding champion\u00e2\u0080\u009d had the donkey lately shown himself. Still, on\nthe whole, and after such a long day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work by sea and shore, the rover\nwas much relieved to find his little castle unleaguered.\n\nThe portal thereof was a yard in height, and perhaps fifteen inches\nwide; not all alike, but in and out, according to the way the things,\nor the boy himself, went rubbing it. A holy hermit once had lived\nthere, if tradition spoke aright. But if so, he must have been as\nnarrow of body to get in, as wide of mind to stop there. At any rate,\nBonny was now the hermit, and less of a saint than a sinner.\n\nThe last glance of sunset was being reflected under the eaves of\ntwilight, when these two came to their home and comfort in the bay of\nthe quiet land. From the foot of the steep white cliff, the green sward\nspread itself with a gentle slope, and breaks of roughness here and\nthere, until it met the depth of cornland, where the feathering bloom\nappeared--for the summer was a hot one--reared upon its jointed stalk,\nand softened into a silver-grey by the level touch of evening. The\nlittle powdered stars of wheat bloom could not now be seen, of course;\nneither the quivering of the awns, nor that hovering radiance, which\nin the hot day moves among them. Still the scent was on the air, the\ndelicate fragrance of the wheat, only caught by waiting for it, when\nthe hour is genial.\n\nBonny and Jack were not in the humour now to wait for anything. The\nscent of the wheat was nothing to them; but the smell of a loaf was\nsomething. And Jack knew, quite as well as Bonny, that let the time\nbe as hard as it would--and it was a very hard time already, though\nnothing to what came afterward--nevertheless, there were two white\nloaves, charmed by their united powers, out of maids who were under\nnotice to quit their situations. Also on their homeward road, they had\nnot failed entirely of a few fine gristly hocks of pork, and the bottom\nof a skin of lard, and something unknown, but highly interesting, from\na place where a pig had been killed that week--a shameful outrage to\nany pig, in the time of hearted cabbages.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Jack, tend thee\u00e2\u0080\u0099zell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bonny, with the air of a full-grown\nman almost, while he was working his own little shoulders in betwixt\nthe worn hair on the ribs, and the balanced bag overhanging them. Jack\nknew what he was meant to do; for he brought his white nose cleverly\nround, just where it was wanted, and pushed it under one end of the\nbag, and tossed it carefully over his back, so that it slid down\nbeautifully.\n\nWhen this great bag lay on the ground (or rather, stood up, in a clumsy\nway, by virtue of what was inside of it), the first thing everybody did\nwas to come, and poke, and sniff at it. And though the everybody was no\nmore than Bonny and his donkey, the duty was not badly done, because\nthey were both so hungry.\n\nWhen the strings were cut, and the bag in relief of tension panted,\never so many things began to ooze, and to ease themselves, out of it.\nFirst of all two great dollops of oar-weed, which had well performed\ntheir task of keeping everything tight and sweet with the hungry\nfragrance of the sea. Then came a mixture of almost anything, which a\nboy of no daintiness was likely to regard as eatable, or a child of no\nkind of \u00e2\u0080\u009cculture\u00e2\u0080\u009d to look upon as a rarity. Bonny was a collector of\nthe grandest order; the one who collects everything. Here was food of\nthe land, and food of the sea, and food of the tidal river, mingled\nwith food for the mind of a boy, who had no mind--to his knowledge. In\nthe humblest way he groped about, and admired almost everything.\n\nNow he had things to admire which (in the heat of the day and the\nwork) had been caught and stowed away anyhow. The boy and the donkey\nhad earned their load with such true labour that now they could not\nremember even half of it. Jack, by hard collar-work at the nets;\nBonny, by cheering him up the sand, and tugging himself with his puny\nshoulders, and then by dancing, and treading away, and kicking with\nnaked feet among the wastrel fish, full of thorns and tails, shed from\nthe vent of the drag-net by the spent farewell of the shoaling wave.\n\nFor, on this very day, there had been the great Midsummer haul at\nShoreham. It was the old custom of the place; but even custom must\nfollow the tides, and the top of the summer spring-tides (when the fish\nare always liveliest) happened, for the year 1811, to come on the 18th\nday of June. Bonny for weeks had been looking forward and now before\nhim lay his reward!\n\nAfter many sweet and bitter uses of adversity, this boy, at an early\nage, had caught the tail of prudence. It had been to his heart at\nfirst, a friendly and a native thing, to feast to the full (when he got\nthe chance) and go empty away till it came again. But now, being grown\nto riper years, and, after much consideration, declared to be at least\ntwelve years old by the only pork-butcher in Steyning, Bonny began to\nknow what was what, and to salt a good deal of his offal.\n\nFor this wise process he now could find a greater call than usual;\nbecause, through the heat of the day, he had stuck to his first and\nfirmly-grounded principle--never to refuse refuse. So that many other\nfine things were mingled, jumbled, and almost churned, among the sundry\nimportations of the flowing tide and net. All these, now, he well\ndelivered (so far as sappy limbs could do it) upon a cleanish piece of\nground, well accustomed to such favours. Then Bonny stood back, with\nhis hands on his knees, and Jack spread his nose at some of it.\n\nLoaves of genuine wheaten bread were getting scarce already. Three or\nfour bad harvests, following long arrears of discontent, and hanging on\nthe heavy arm of desperate taxation, kept the country, and the farmers,\nand the people that must be fed, in such a condition that we (who\ncannot be now content with anything) deserve no blame when we smack our\nlips in our dainty contempt of our grandfathers.\n\nBonny was always good to Jack, according to the way they had of looking\nat one another; and so, of the choicest spoils, he gave him a half-peck\nloaf, of a fibre such as they seldom softened their teeth with. Jack\npreferred this to any clover, even when that luxury could be won by\nclever stealing; and now he trotted away with his loaf to the nearest\nstump where backing-power against his strong jaws could be got. Here he\nlaid his loaf against the stump, and went a little way back to think\nabout it, and to be sure that every atom was for him. Then, without\nscruple or time to spare, he tucked up his lips, and began in a hurry\nto make a bold dash for the heart of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMore haste, less speed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a proverb that seems, at first sight, one\nof the last that need be impressed upon a donkey. Yet, in the present\ninstance, Jack should have spared himself time to study it; for in less\nthan a moment he ran up to Bonny, with his wide mouth at its widest,\nsnorting with pain, and much yearning to bellow, but by the position\ndisabled. There was something stuck fast in the roof of his mouth, in a\ngroove of the veiny black arches; and work as he might with his wounded\ntongue, he was only driving it further in. His great black eyes, as\nhe gasped with fright, and the piteous whine of his quivering nose,\nand his way altogether so scared poor Bonny, that the chances were he\nwould run away. And so, no doubt, he must have done (being but a little\nboy as yet), if it had not chanced that a flash of something caught\nhis quick eye suddenly, something richly shining in the cavern of the\ndonkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth.\n\nThis was enough, of course, for Bonny. His instinct of scratching,\nand digging, and hiding was up and at work in a moment. He thrust his\nbrown hand between Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great jaws, and drew it back quickly enough\nto escape the snap of their glad reunion. And in his hand was something\nwhich he had drawn from the pouch of the net that day, but scarcely\nstopped to look at twice, in the huddle of weeds and the sweeping.\nIt had lain among many fine gifts of the sea--skates, and dog-fish,\nsea-devils, sting-rays, thorn-backs, inky cuttles, and scollops,\ncockles, whelks, green crabs, jelly-fish, and everything else that\nmakes fishermen swear, and then grin, and then spit on their palms\nagain. Afterwards in Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sack it had lain with manifold boons of\nthe life-giving earth, extracted from her motherly feeling by one or\ntwo good butchers.\n\nBonny made no bones of this. Fish, flesh, fowl, or stale\nred-herring--he welcomed all the works of charity with a charitable\nnose, and fingers not of the nicest. So that his judgment could\nscarcely have been \u00e2\u0080\u009cprejudicially affected by any preconceived\nopinion\u00e2\u0080\u009d--as our purest writers love to say--when he dropped this\nthing, and smelled his thumb, and cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord, how it makes my hands\nitch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter such a strong expression, what can we have to say to him? It is\nthe privilege of our period to put under our feet whatever we would\nrather not face out. At the same time, to pretend to love it, and lift\nit by education. Nevertheless, one may try to doubt whether Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngrandchildren (if he ever presumed to have any) thrive on the lesson,\nas well as he did on the loaf, of charity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nCHAMBER PRACTICE.\n\n\nThere used to be a row of buildings, well within the sacred precincts\nof the Inner Temple, but still preserving a fair look-out on the\nwharves, and the tidal gut at their back, till the whole view was\nswallowed by gas-works. Here for long ages law had flourished on the\nexcrete things of outlawry, fed by the reek of Whitefriars, as a good\nnettle enjoys the mixen.\n\nAlready, however, some sweeping changes had much improved this\nneighbourhood; and the low attorneys who throve on crime, and of whom\nwe get unpleasant glimpses through our classic novelists, had been\nsucceeded by men of repute, and learning, and large practice. And\namong all these there was not one more widely known and respected than\nGlanvil Malahide, K.C.; an eminent equity-barrister, who now declined\nto don the wig in any ordinary cause. He had been obliged, of course,\nto fight, like the rest of mankind, for celebrity; but as soon as this\nwas well assured, he quitted the noisier sides of it. But his love of\nthe subtleties of the law (spun into fairer and frailer gossamer by the\nsoft spider of equity), as well as the power of habit, kept him to his\nold profession; so that he took to chamber practice, and had more than\nhe could manage.\n\nSir Roland Lorraine had known this gentleman by repute at Oxford, when\nGlanvil Malahide was young, and believed to be one of the best scholars\nthere; in the days when scholarship often ripened (as it seldom does\nnow) to learning. For the scholarship now must be kept quite young, for\nthe smaller needs of tuition.\n\nHence it came to pass that as soon as Hilary Lorraine was quite acquit\nof Oxford leading-strings, and had scrambled into some degree, his\nfather, who especially wished (for some reasons of his own) to keep the\nboy out of the army, entered him gladly among the pupils of Mr. Glanvil\nMalahide. Not that Hilary was expected ever to wear the horsehair much\n(unless an insane desire to do so should find its way into his open\nsoul), but that the excellent goodness of law might drop, like the\ngentle dew from heaven, and grow him into a Justice of the Peace.\n\nHilary looked upon this matter, as he did on too many others, with a\nsweet indifference. If he could only have had his own way, he would\nhave been a soldier long ago; for that was the time when all the spirit\nof Britain was roused up to arms. But this young fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great fault\nwas, to be compact of so many elements that nothing was settled amongst\nthem. He had \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat gifts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Mr. Malahide said--\u00e2\u0080\u009cextraordinary\ntalents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we say now--but nobody knew (least of all their owner) how to\nwork them properly. This is one of the most unlucky compositions of the\nhuman mind--to be applicable to everything, but applied to nothing. If\nHilary had lain under pressure, and been squeezed into one direction,\nhe must have become a man of mark.\n\nThis his father could not see. As a general rule a father fails to\nknow what his son is fit for; and after disappointment, fancies (for a\nlittle time at least) himself a fool to have taken the boy to be all\nthat the mother said of him. Nevertheless, the poor mother knows how\nright she was, and the world how wrong.\n\nBut Hilary Lorraine, from childhood, had no mother to help him. What\nhe had to help him was good birth, good looks, good abilities, a very\nsweet temper, and a kind and truly genial nature. Also a strongish\nwill of his own (whenever his heart was moving), yet ashamed to stand\nforth boldly in the lesser matters. And here was his fatal error; that\nhe looked upon almost everything as one of the lesser matters. He had,\nof course, a host of friends, from the freedom of his manner; and\nsometimes he would do such things that the best, or even the worst of\nthem, could no longer walk with him. Things not vicious, but a great\ndeal too far gone in the opposite way--such as the snatching up of a\ntruly naked child and caressing it, or any other shameful act, in the\nface of the noblest Christendom. These things he would do, and worse;\nsuch as no toady with self-respect could smile at in broad daylight,\nand such as often exposed the lad to laughter in good society. One of\nhis best friends used to say that Hilary wanted a vice or two to make\nhis virtues balance. This may have been so; but none the less, he had\nhis share of failings.\n\nFor a sample of these last, he had taken up and made much of one of his\nfellow-pupils in these well-connected chambers. This was one Gregory\nLovejoy, a youth entirely out of his element among fashionable sparks.\nSteadfast ambition of a conceptive mother sent him, against his stars,\nto London; and here he became the whetstone for those brilliant blades,\nhis fellow-pupils; because he had been at no university, nor even so\nmuch as a public school, and had no introduction to anybody who had\nnever heard of him.\n\nNow the more the rest disdained this fellow, the more Lorraine regarded\nhim; feeling, with a sense too delicate to arise from any thought,\nthat shame was done to good birth even by becoming conscious of it,\nexcept upon great occasions. And so, without giving much offence, or\npretending to be a champion, Hilary used to shield young Lovejoy from\nthe blunt shafts of small humour continually levelled at him.\n\nMr. Malahide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set of chambers was perhaps the best to be found in\nEquity Walk, Inner Temple. His pupils--ten in number always, because\nhe would accept no more, and his high repute insured no less--these\nworthy youths had the longest room, facing with three whitey-brown\nwindows into \u00e2\u0080\u009cNuma Square.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hence the view, contemning all \u00e2\u0080\u009cutilitarian\nedifices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d freely ranged, across the garden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s classic walks of\nasphodel, to the broad Lethean river on whose wharves we are such\nweeds. For \u00e2\u0080\u009cPaper Buildings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d named from some swift sequence of\nsuggestion, reared no lofty height as yet to mar the sedentary view.\n\nAll who have the local key will enter into the scene at once; so far,\nat least, as necessary change has failed to operate. But Mr. Malahide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npupils scarcely ever looked out of the windows. None, however, should\nrashly blame them for apathy as to the prospect. They seldom looked out\nof the windows, because they were very seldom inside them.\n\nIn the first place, their attendance there was voluntary and\nprecarious. They paid their money, and they took their choice whether\nthey ever did anything more. Each of them paid--or his father for\nhim--a fee of a hundred guineas to have the \u00e2\u0080\u009crun of the chambers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nmost of them carried out their purpose by a runaway from them. The\nless they came, the less trouble they caused to Mr. Glanvil Malahide;\nwho always gave them that much to know, when they paid their fee of\nentrance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you mean to be a lawyer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will do my best\nto make you one. If you only come for the name of it, I shall say but\nlittle more to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This, of course, was fair enough, and the utmost\nthat could be expected of him: for most of his pupils were young men\nof birth, or good position in the English counties, to whom in their\nfuture condition of life a little smattering of law, or the credit of\nowning such smattering, would be worth a few hundred guineas. Common\nLaw, of course, was far more likely to avail them, in their rubs of\nthe world, than equity; but of that fine drug they had generally taken\ntheir dose in Pleaders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Chambers, and were come to wash the taste away\nin the purer shallows of equity.\n\nHilary, therefore, might be considered, and certainly did consider\nhimself, a remarkably attentive pupil, for he generally was to be\nfound in chambers four or even five days of the week, coming in time\nto read all the news, before the five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock dinner in Hall. Whereas\nthe Honourable Robert Gumption, and Sir Francis Kickabout, two of his\nfellow-pupils, had only been seen in chambers once since they paid\ntheir respective fees; and the reason of their attendance then was\nthat they found the towels too dirty to use at the billiard-rooms in\nFleet Street. The clerks used to say among themselves, that these young\nfellows must be dreadful fools to pay one hundred guineas, because\nany swell with the proper cheek might easy enough have the go of the\nchambers, and nobody none the wiser; for they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know him, nor\nthe other young gents, and least of all old \u00e2\u0080\u009chorsewig.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever, there chanced to be two or three men who made something more\nthan a very expensive lounge of these eminent chambers. Of these\nworthy fellows, Rice Cockles was one (who had been senior wrangler\ntwo years before, and from that time knew not one good night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rest,\ntill the Woolsack broke his fall into his grave), and another was\nGregory Lovejoy. Cockles was thoroughly conscious--as behoves a senior\nwrangler--of possessing great abilities; and Lovejoy knew, on his own\nbehalf, that his mother at least was as sure as could be of all the\nwonders he must do.\n\nHilary could not bear Rice Cockles, who was of a dry sarcastic vein;\nbut he liked young Lovejoy more and more, the more he had to defend\nhim. Youths who have not had the fortune to be at a public school or\na college seldom know how to hold their tongues, until the world has\nsilenced them. Gregory, therefore, thought no harm to boast opportunely\none fine May morning (when some one had seen a tree blossoming\nsomewhere) of the beauty of his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cherry-trees. How noble and\ngrand they must be just now, one sheet of white, white, white, he said,\nas big as the Inner and the Middle Temple and Lincoln\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Inn, all put\ntogether! And then how the bees were among them buzzing, knowing which\nsorts first to milk; and the tortoiseshell butterflies quite sure to\nbe out, for the first of their summering. But in the moonlight, best\nof all, when the moon was three days short of full, then was the time\nan unhappy Londoner must be amazed with happiness. Then to walk among\nthem was like walking in a fairy-land, or being lost in a sky of snow,\nbefore a flake begins to fall. A delicate soft world of white, an\nin-and-out of fancy lace, a feeling of some white witchery, and almost\na fright that little white blossoms have such power over one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere may one find this grand paradise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Rice Cockles, as if he\ncould scarcely refrain his feet from the road to it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFive miles the other side of Sevenoaks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gregory answered, boldly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know the country. Does your father grow cherries for Covent Garden\nmarket?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course he does. Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thenceforth in chambers\nLovejoy was always known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCherry Lovejoy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he proudly answered\nto that name.\n\nIt was now the end of June, and the cherries must be getting ripe. The\nday had been very hot and sultry, and Hilary came into chambers later\nthan his usual time, but fresh as a lark, as he always was. Even Mr.\nMalahide had felt the weight of the weather, and of his own threescore\nyears and five, and in his own room was dozing. The three clerks, in\ntheir little den, were fit for next to nothing, except to be far away\nin some meadow, with sleepy beer, under alder-trees. Even Rice Cockles\nhad struck work with one of those hopeless headaches which are bred by\nhot weather from satire, a thing that turns sour above freezing-point;\nand no one was dwelling in the long hot room save the peaceful and\nsteady Gregory.\n\nEven he, with his resolute will to fulfil his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prophecies,\ncould scarcely keep his mind from flagging, or his mouth from yawning,\nas he went through some most elaborate answer to a grand petition\nin equity--the iniquity being, to a common mind, that the question\ncould have arisen. But Mr. Malahide, of course, regarded things\nprofessionally.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLovejoy, thy name is \u00e2\u0080\u0098Love misery,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried young Lorraine, who never\ncalled his fellow-pupil \u00e2\u0080\u009cCherry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d though perfectly welcome to do so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\npassed an optician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop just now, and the thermometer stands at 96\u00c2\u00b0.\nThat quill must have come from an ostrich to be able to move in such\nweather. Even the Counsellor yields to the elements. Hark how he winds\nhis sultry horn! Is it not a great and true writer who says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I tell\nthee that the quills of the law are the deadliest shafts of the Evil\nOne\u00e2\u0080\u0099? Come, therefore, and try a darting match.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGregory felt no inclination for so hot a pastime; he had formed,\nhowever, a habit of yielding to the impulsive and popular Hilary,\nwhich led him into a few small scrapes, and one or two that were not\nsmall. Lorraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unusual brightness of nature, and personal beauty,\nand gentle bearing, as well as an inborn readiness to be pleased with\neverybody, insured him a good liking with almost all kinds of people.\nHow then could young Lovejoy, of a fine but unshapen character, and\nnever introduced to the very skirts of good society, help looking up\nto his champion Hilary as a charming deity? Therefore he made way at\nonce for Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sudden freak for darts. The whole world being at war\njust then (as happens upon the average in every generation), Cherry\nLovejoy slung his target, a legal almanac for the year. Then he took\nfour long quills, and pared them of their plumes, and split the shafts,\nand fitted each with four paper wings, cut and balanced cleverly. His\naptness in the business showed that this was not his first attempt; and\nit was a hard and cruel thing that he should now have to prepare them.\nBut the clerks had a regular trick of stealing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cyoung pups\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d darts\nfrom their unlocked drawers, partly for practice among themselves, but\nmainly to please their families.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCapital! Beautifully done!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary, as full of life as if the\nonly warmth of the neighbourhood were inside him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe never turned out\nsuch a good lot before; I could never do that like you. But now for the\ntips, my dear fellow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny fool can do what I have done. But no one can cut the tip at all,\nto stick in the target and not bounce back; only you, Mr. Lorraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMister Lorraine! now, Gregory Lovejoy, I thought we liked one another\nwell enough to have dropped that long ago. If you will only vouchsafe\nto notice, you shall see how I cut the tip, so that the well-sped\njavelin pierces even cover of calf-skin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was done in a moment, by\nsome quick art, inherited, perhaps, from Prince Agasicles; and then\nthey took their stations.\n\nFrom the further end of the room they cast (for thirty feet or more\nperhaps) over two great tables scarred by keen generations of lawyers.\nHilary threw the stronger shaft, but Gregory took more careful aim; so\nthat in spite of the stifling heat, the contest grew exciting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlest if they young donkeys knows hot from cold!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the senior\nclerk, disturbed in his little room by the prodding and walking, and\nthe lively voices.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSooner them, than you nor me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the second clerk muttered sleepily.\nWhen the most ungrammatical English is wanted, a copying clerk is the\nman to supply it.\n\nIn spite of unkindly criticism, the brisk aconitic strife went on. And\nevery hit was chronicled on a long sheet of draft paper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSixteen to you, eighteen to me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Gregory, poising his long\nshadowed spear, while his coat and waistcoat lay in the folds of a\nsuit that could never terminate, and his square Kentish face was even\nredder than a ripe May-Duke. At that moment the door was opened, and in\ncame Mr. Malahide.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust so!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in his quiet way; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI now understand the origin of a\nnoise which has often puzzled me. Lorraine, what a baby you must be!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan a baby do that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, as he stepped into poor Gregory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nplace, and sped his dart into the Chancellor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye, the bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-eye of\ntheir target.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was well done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Malahide answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps it is the only\ngood shot you will ever make in your profession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope not, sir. Under your careful tuition I am laying the\nfoundations of a mighty host of learning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this the lawyer was truly pleased. He really did believe that he\ntook some trouble with his pupils; and his very kind heart was always\ngratified by their praises. And he showed his pleasure in his usual way\nby harping on verbal niceties.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFoundations of a host, Lorraine! Foundations of a pile, you mean; and\nas yet, _lusisti pilis_. But you may be a credit to me yet. Allowance\nmust be made for this great heat. I will talk to you to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these few words, and a pleasant smile, the eminent lawyer withdrew\nto his den, feigning to have caught no glimpse of the deeply-blushing\nLovejoy. For he knew quite well that Gregory could not afford to play\nwith his schooling; and so (like a proper gentleman) he fell upon the\none who could. Hilary saw his motive, and with his usual speed admired\nhim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a fine fellow he is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as if in pure self-commune; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom\nthe time he becomes Lord Chancellor, I will dart at no legal almanac.\nBut the present fellow--however, the weather is too hot to talk of him.\nLovejoy, wilt thou come with me? I must break out into the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Gregory, drawing up at the magic word from his stool of\nrepentance, and the desk of his diminished head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was that you\nsaid, Lorraine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFair indeed is the thing thou hast said, and fair is the way thou\nsaidst it. Tush! shall I never get wholly out of my ignorant knowledge\nof Greek plays? Of languages that be, or have been, only two words\nsurvive this weather, in the streets of London town; one is \u00e2\u0080\u0098rus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and\nthe other \u00e2\u0080\u0098country.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a sweet and decorous thing to die on behalf of the country.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nThat line I remember well; you must have seen it somewhere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is one of my earliest memories, and not a purely happy one. But\nthat is \u00e2\u0080\u0098patria,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 not \u00e2\u0080\u0098rus.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Patria\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is the fatherland; \u00e2\u0080\u0098rus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a\nfellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother. None can understand this parable till they have lived\nin London.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gregory, coming up shyly, yet with his brown eyes\nsparkling, and a steadfast mouth to declare himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are very much\nabove me, of course, I know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am uncommonly proud to hear it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hilary answered, with his most\nsweet smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause I must be a much finer fellow than I ever could\nhave dreamed of being.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, you know well enough what I mean. I mean, in position of life,\nand all that, and birth, and society--and so on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary gravely, making a trumpet of blotting paper;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cany other advantage, Gregory?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty, if I could stop to tell them. But I see that you mean to argue\nit. Now, argument is a thing that always----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Gregory, just acknowledge me your superior in argument, and I\nwill confess myself your superior in every one of those other things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you know, Lorraine, I could scarcely do that. Because it was\nonly the very last time----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExactly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cso it was--the very last time, you left me no\nmore than a shadow caught in a cleft stick. Therefore, friend Gregory,\nsay your say, without any traps for the sole of my foot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, what I was thinking was no more than this--if you would take it\ninto consideration now--considering what the weather is, and all the\ngreat people gone out of London, and the streets like fire almost, and\nthe lawyers frightened by the comet, quite as if, as if, almost----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs if it were the devil come for them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExactly so. Bellows\u00e2\u0080\u0099 clerk told me, after he saw the comet, that he\ncould prove he had never been articled. And when you come to consider\nalso that there will be a row to-morrow morning--not much, of course,\nbut still a thing to be avoided till the weather cools--I thought; at\nleast, I began to think----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear fellow, what? Anxiety in this dreadful weather is fever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing, nothing at all, Lorraine. But you are the sweetest-tempered\nfellow I ever came across; and so I thought that you would not mind--at\nleast, not so very much, perhaps----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy sweet temper is worn out. I have no mind to mind anything, Gregory;\ncome and dine with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is how you stop me always, Lorraine; I cannot be for ever coming,\nand come, to dine with you. I always like it; but you know----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, I know that I like it too. It is high time to see about\nit. Who could dine in Hall to-day, and drink his bottle of red-hot\nport?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could, and so could a hundred others. And I mean to do it,\nunless----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnless what? Mysterious Gregory, by your face I know that you\nhave some very fine thing to propose. Have you the heart to keep me\nsuspended, as well as uncommonly hungry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is nothing to make a fuss about. Lorraine, you want to get out of\ntown, for a little wholesome air. I want to do the same; and something\ncame into my head quite casually.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch things have an inspiration. Out with it at last, fair Gregory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, if you must have it, how I should like for you to come\nwith me to have a little turn among my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cherry-trees!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a noble thought!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca poetic imagination only\ncould have hit on such a thought. The thermometer at 96\u00c2\u00b0--and the\ncherries--can they be sour now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch a thing is quite impossible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gregory answered gravely; \u00e2\u0080\u009cin a\nvery cold, wet summer they are sometimes a little middling. But in such\na splendid year as this, there can be no two opinions. Would you like\nto see them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Lovejoy, I can put up with much; but not with maddening\nquestions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean, I suppose, that you could enjoy half-a-dozen cool red\ncherries, if you had the chance to pick them in among the long green\nleaves?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHalf-a-dozen! Half-a-peck; and half-a-bushel afterwards. Where have I\nput my hat? I am off, if it costs my surviving sixpence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLorraine, all the coaches are gone for the day. But you are always in\nsuch a hurry. You ought to think a little, perhaps, before you make up\nyour mind to come. Remember that my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house is a good house, and\nas comfortable as any you could wish to see; still it may be different\nfrom what you are accustomed to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch things are not worth thinking about. Custom, and all that, are\nquite below contempt; and we are beginning to treat it so. The greatest\nmistake of our lives is custom; and the greatest delight is to kick it\naway. Will your father be glad to see me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has heard me talk of you, many a time; and he would have been glad\nto come to London (though he hates it so abominably), to see you and\nto ask you down, if he thought that you would require it. It is a very\nold-fashioned place; you must please to bear that in mind. Also, my\nfather, and my mother, and all of us, are old-fashioned people, living\nin a quiet way. You would carry on more in an hour, than we do in a\ntwelvemonth. We like to go all over things, ever so many times, perhaps\n(like pushing rings up and down a stick), before we begin to settle\nthem. But when we have settled them, we never start again; as you seem\nto do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Gregory, Gregory, this is bad. When did you know me to start\nagain? Ready I am to start this once, and to dwell in the orchards for\never.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a few words more, these two young fellows agreed to take their luck\nof it. There was nothing in chambers for Lovejoy to lose, by going away\nfor a day or two; and Hilary long had felt uneasy at leaving a holiday\noverdue. Therefore they made their minds up promptly for an early\nstart next morning, ere the drowsy town should begin to kick up its\nchimney-pots, like a sluggard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGregory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lorraine, at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour mind is a garden of genius. We\ntwo will sit upon bushel-baskets, and watch the sun rise out of sacks.\nBefore he sets, we will challenge him to face our early waggon. Covent\nGarden is our trysting spot, and the hour 4 a.m. Oh, day to be marked\nwith white chalk for ever!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell how that may be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the less fervent\nGregory. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no chalk in our grounds at all; and I never saw\nblack chalk anywhere. But can I trust you to be there? If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ncome, I shall not go without you; and the whole affair must be put off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo fear, Gregory; no fear of me. The lark shall still be on her\nnest;--but wait, my friend, I will tell the Counsellor, lest I seem to\ndread his face.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLovejoy saw that this was the bounden duty of a gentleman, inasmuch as\nthe learned lawyer had promised his young friend a little remonstrance\nupon the following morning. The chances were that he would forget it:\nand this, of course, enhanced the duty of making him remember it.\nTherefore Hilary gave three taps on the worm-eaten door of his good\ntutor, according to the scale of precedence. This rule was--inferior\nclerk, one tap; head-clerk, two taps; pupil (being no clerk at all, and\npaying, not drawing, salary), as many taps as he might think proper, in\na reasonable way.\n\nHilary, of course, began, as he always managed to begin, with almost\neverybody.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry to disturb you, sir; and I have nothing particular to say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn that case, why did you come, Lorraine? It is your usual state of\nmind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, laughing at the terse mood of the master, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nthought you had something to say to me--a very unusual state of mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe was going to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009con your part;\u00e2\u0080\u009d but stopped, with a well-bred\nyouth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perception of the unbecoming.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I have something to say to you. I remember it now, quite clearly.\nYou were playing some childish game with Lovejoy, in the pupil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room.\nNow, this is all well enough for you, who are fit for nothing else,\nperhaps. Your father expects no work from you; and if he did, he would\nnever get it. You may do very well, in your careless way, being born to\nthe gift of indifference. But those who can and must work hard--is it\nhonest of you to entice them? You think that I speak severely. Perhaps\nI do, because I feel that I am speaking to a gentleman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is uncommonly hard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, with his bright blue eyes half\nconscious of a shameful spring of moisture, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat a fellow always gets\nit worse for trying to be a gentleman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have touched a great truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Malahide answered, labouring\nheavily not to smile; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut so it always must be. My boy, I am sorry\nto vex you; but to be vexed is better than to grieve. You like young\nLovejoy--don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make him idle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I will dart at him henceforth, whenever I see him lazy; instead\nof the late Lord Chancellor, now sitting upon asphodel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the great lawyer suddenly asked, in a flush of unusual\ninterest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have been at Oxford quite recently. They do all sorts of\nthings there now. Have they settled what asphodel is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir, I fear that they never will. There are several other moot\nquestions still. But with your kind leave, I mean to try to settle that\npoint to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nWITH THE COSTERMONGERS.\n\n\nMartin Lovejoy, Gregory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, owned and worked a pleasant farm in\nthat part of Kent which the natives love to call the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGarden of Eden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIn the valley of the upper Medway, a few miles above Maidstone, pretty\nhamlets follow the soft winding of the river. Here an ancient race of\nsettlers, quiet and intelligent, chose their home, and chose it well,\nand love it as dearly as ever.\n\nTo argue with such people is to fall below their mercy. They stand at\ntheir cottage-doors, serenely as thirty generations of them have stood.\nA riotous storm or two may have swept them; but it never lasted long.\nThe bowers of hop and of honeysuckle, trimmed alleys, and rambling\nroses, the flowering trees by the side of the road, and the truest of\ntrue green meadows, the wealth of deep orchards retiring away--as all\nwealth does--to enjoy itself; and where the land condescends to wheat,\nthe vast gratitude of the wheat-crop,--nobody wonders, after a while,\nthat these men know their value.\n\nThe early sun was up and slurring light upon London housetops, as a\ntask of duty only, having lost all interest in a thing even he can make\nno hand of. But the brisk air of the morning, after such a night of\nsweltering, and of strong smells under slates, rode in the perpetual\nbalance of the clime, and spread itself. Fresh, cool draughts of\nnew-born day, as vague as the smile of an infant, roved about; yet\nwere to be caught according to the dew-lines. And of these the best\nand truest followed into Covent Garden, under the force of attraction\ntowards the green stuff they had dwelt among.\n\nHere was a wondrous reek of men before the night had spent itself. Such\na Babel, of a market-morning in \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe berry-season,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as makes one long\nto understand the mother-tongue of nobody. Many things are nice and\nhandsome; fruit and flowers are fair and fresh; life is as swift as\nlife can be; and the pulse of price throbs everywhere. Yet, upon the\nwhole, it is wiser not to say much more of it.\n\nMartin Lovejoy scarcely ever ventured into this stormy world. In summer\nand autumn he was obliged to send some of his fruit to London; but he\nalways sent it under the care of a trusty old retainer, Master John\nShorne, whose crusty temper and crisp wit were a puzzle to the Cockney\ncostermonger. Throughout the market, this man was known familiarly as\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKentish Crust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the name helped him well in his business.\n\nNow, in the summer morning early, Hilary Lorraine, with his most\nsprightly walk and manner, sought his way through the crowded alleys,\nand the swarms of those that buy and sell. Even the roughest of rough\ncustomers (when both demand and supply are rough), though they would\nnot yield him way, at any rate did not shove him by. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA swell, to buy\nfruit for his sweetheart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was their conclusion in half a glance at\nhim. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, sir, here you are! berries for nothing, and cherries we\npays you for eating of them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith the help of these generous fellows, Hilary found his way to John\nShorne and the waggon. The horses, in unbuckled ease, were munching\ntheir well-earned corn close by; for at that time Covent Garden was not\nsqueezed and driven as now it is. The tail-board of the waggon was now\nhanging upon its hinges, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cKentish Crust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d on his springy rostrum,\ndealt with the fag-end of his goods. The market, in those days, was not\nflooded with poor foreign produce, fair to the eye, but a fraud on the\nbelly, and full of most dangerous colic. Englishmen, at that time, did\nnot spend their keenest wits upon the newest and speediest measures for\nrobbing their brother Englishmen; and a native would really buy from\nhis neighbour as gladly as from his born enemy.\n\nMaster John Shorne had a canvas bag on the right side of his breeches,\nhanging outside, full in sight, defying every cut-purse. That age was\ncomparatively honest; nevertheless, John kept a club, cut in Mereworth\nwood, quite handy. And, at every sale he made, he rang his coin of the\nrealm in his bag, as if he were calling bees all round the waggon. This\ngenerally led to another sale. For money has a rich and irresistible\njoy in jingling.\n\nHilary was delighted to watch these things, so entirely new to him. He\nhad that fatal gift of sliding into other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minds, and wondering\nwhat to do there. Not as a great poet has it (still reserving his own\nstrength, and playing on the smaller nature kindly as he loves it),\nbut simply as a child rejoices to play with other children. So that\nhe entered eagerly into the sudden changes of John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s temper, according\nto the tone, the bidding, and, most of all, the importance of the\ncustomers that came to him. By this time the cherries were all sold\nout, having left no trace except some red splashes, where an over-ripe\nsieve had been bleeding. But the Kentish man still had some bushels of\npeas, and new potatoes, and bunches of coleworts, and early carrots,\nbesides five or six dozens of creamy cauliflowers, and several scores\nof fine-hearted lettuce. Therefore he was dancing with great excitement\nup and down his van, for he could not bear to go home uncleared; and\nsome of his shrewder customers saw that by waiting a little longer they\nwould be likely to get things at half-price. Of course he was fully\nalive to this, and had done his best to hide surplus stock, by means of\nsacks, and mats, and empty bushels piled upon full ones.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCrusty, thou must come down, old fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried a one-eyed\ncostermonger, winking first at John and then through the rails, and\neven at the springs of the van; \u00e2\u0080\u009chalf the load will go back to Kent, or\nelse to the cowkeeper, if so be you holds on so almighty dear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa, then, Joe, are you waiting for that? Go to the cow-yard and take\nyour turn. They always feeds the one-eyed first. Gentlemen, now--while\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything left! We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve kept all the very best back to the last,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099cos they chanced to be packed by an Irishman. \u00e2\u0080\u0098First goes in, must\nfirst come out.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Paddy, are you there to stick to it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe jabers, and how could I slip out, when the hape of you was atop of\nme? And right I was, be the holy poker; there it all is the very first\nin the bottom of the vhan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, are you nearly ready, John?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Gregory, suddenly appearing\nthrough the laughter of the crowd; \u00e2\u0080\u009chere is the gentleman going with\nus, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have him kept waiting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome up, Master Greg, and help sell out, if you know the time better\nthan I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John Shorne was vexed, or he would not so have spoken to\nhis master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son.\n\nTo his great surprise, with a bound up came not Gregory Lovejoy, who\nwas always a little bit shy of the marketing, but Hilary Lorraine,\ndeclared by dress and manner (clearly marked, as now they never can be)\nof an order wholly different from the people round him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me help you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have long been looking on; I am\nsure that I understand it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cForty years have I been at \u00e2\u0080\u0099un, and I scarcely knows \u00e2\u0080\u0099un now. They\ntakes a deal of mannerin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, sir, and the prices will go in and out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt; and yet for the sport of it, let me help you, Master Shorne.\nI will not sell a leaf below the price you whisper to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn such height of life and hurry, half a minute is enough to fetch a\ngreat crowd anywhere. It was round the market in ten seconds that\na grand lord was going to sell out of Grower Lovejoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waggon. For\na great wager, of course it must be; and all who could rush, rushed\nto see. Hilary let them get ready, and waited till he saw that their\nmoney was burning. Meanwhile Crusty John was grinning one of his most\nexperienced grins.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him; oh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gregory shouted to the salesman, as\nHilary came to the rostrum with a bunch of carrots in one hand and a\ncauliflower in the other--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would his friends say if they heard it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not let \u00e2\u0080\u0099un,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John Shorne answered, mischievously taking the\nverb in its (now) provincial sense; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy should I let \u00e2\u0080\u0099un? It can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhurt he, and it may do good to we.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn less than ten minutes the van was cleared, and at such prices as\nGrower Lovejoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goods had not fetched all through the summer. Such\ncompetition arose for the honour of purchasing from a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnobleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nso enchanted were the dealers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ladies, many of whom came thronging\nround, with Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bright complexion, gay address, and complaisancy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell done, my lord! well done indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Crusty John, to keep up the\nfiction, shouted when he had pouched the money--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen and ladies,\nmy lord will sell again next week; he has a heavy bet about it with the\nPrince Reg----tush, what a fool I am! they will send me to prison if I\ntell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs a general rule, the more suspicious people are in some ways, the\nmore credulous are they in all the rest. Kentish Crust was aware of\nthis, and expected and found for the next two months extraordinary\ninquiry for his goods.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFriend Gregory, wherefore art thou glum?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary to young\nLovejoy, while the horses with their bunched-up tails were being\nbuckled to again. Lorraine was radiant with joy, both at his recent\ntriumph in a matter quite unknown to him, and even more because of many\nlittle pictures spread before him by his brisk imagination far away\nfrom London. Every stamp of a horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hoof was as good as a beat of the\nheart to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the sensible Gregory answered, after some hesitation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nvexed at the foolish thing you have done. Not that it really is at all\na disgrace to you, or your family, but that the world would take it so;\nand we must think as the world does.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMust we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Hilary, smiling kindly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell, if we must, let us\nthink it on springs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the word he leaped into the fruit-van so lightly that the strong\nsprings scarcely shook; and Gregory could do no better than climb in\ncalmly after him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGee-wugg,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Master Shorne; and he had no need\nto say it twice; the bright brass harness flashed the sun, and the\nhorses merrily rang their hoofs, on the road to their native land of\nKent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTO THE CHERRY-ORCHARDS.\n\n\nHilary Lorraine enjoyed his sudden delivery from London, and the fresh\ndelight of the dewy country, with such loud approval, and such noisy\nlightsomeness of heart, that even Crusty John, perched high on the\ndriving-box above him, could not help looking back now and then into\nthe van, and affording the horses the benefit of his opinion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA right\ndown hearty one he be, as\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make some of our maids look alive. And the\nworst time of year for such work too, when the May-Dukes is in, and the\nHearts a colouring!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary was sitting on an empty \u00e2\u0080\u009chalf sieve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d mounted on an empty\nbushel, and with his usual affability enjoying the converse of \u00e2\u0080\u009cPaddy\nfrom Cork,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as everybody called the old Irishman, who served alike for\nfarm, road, or market, as the \u00e2\u0080\u009clad of all work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Gregory Lovejoy,\nbeing of a somewhat grave and silent order, was already beginning to\ndoubt his own prudence in bringing their impulsive friend so near\nto a certain fair cousin of his now staying at the hospitable farm,\nin whom he felt a tender interest. Poor Lovejoy feared that his\nchance would be small against this dashing stranger; and he balanced\nuncomfortably in his mind whether or not he should drop a hint, at the\nfirst opportunity, to Lorraine, concerning his views in that quarter.\nOften he almost resolved to do so; and then to his diffidence it seemed\npresumptuous to fancy that any young fellow of Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birth and\nexpectations would entangle himself in their rustic world.\n\nAt Bromley they pulled up, to bait \u00e2\u0080\u009cman and beast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d three fine horses\nand four good men, eager to know the reason why they should not have\ntheir breakfast. Lorraine, although very short of cash (as he always\nfound the means to be), demanded and stood out for leave to pay for\neverybody. This privilege was obtained at last--as it generally is by\npersistency--and after that it was felt that Hilary could no longer be\ndenied his manifest right to drive the van. He had driven the Brighton\nfour-horse coach, the whole way to London, times and again; and it was\nperfectly absurd to suppose that he could not manage three horses.\nMaster John Shorne yielded his seat, apparently to this reasoning,\nbut really to his own sure knowledge that the horses after so long\na journey would be, on their way to stall, as quiet as lambs in the\nevening. Therefore he rolled himself up in the van, and slept the sleep\nof the man who has been up and wide-awake all night, for the sake of\nother people.\n\nThe horses well knew the true way home, and offered no cause for bit\nor whip; and they seemed to be taken sometimes with the pleasure which\nHilary found in addressing them. They lifted their tails, and they\npricked their ears, at the proper occasions genially; till the heat of\nthe day settled down on their backs, and their creases grew dark and\nthen lathery. And the horsefly (which generally forbears the pleasure\nof nuisance till July) in this unusually hot summer was earnest in his\nvocation already. Therefore, being of a leisurely mind, as behoves all\ngenuine sons of the soil, Master Shorne called a halt, through the\nblazing time of noon, before battling with the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBackbone of Kent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as\nthe beautiful North Down range is called. Here in a secluded glen they\nshunned the heats of Canicula under the sign of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPig and Whistle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus the afternoon was wearing when they came to Sevenoaks, and passing\nthrough that pleasant town descended into the weald of Kent. No one but\nHilary cared for the wonderful beauty and richness of the view, breadth\nupon breadth of fruit-land, woven in and out with hops and corn; and\ntowards the windings of the Medway, pastures of the deepest green even\nnow after the heat of the sun, and thirst of the comet that drank the\ndew. Turning on the left from the Tunbridge road, they threaded their\nway along narrow lanes, where the hedges no longer were scarred with\nchalk, but tapestried with all shades of green, and even in the broken\nplaces, rich with little cascades of loam. Careless dog-rose played\nabove them with its loose abandonment; and honeysuckle was almost ready\nto release its clustered tongues. But \u00e2\u0080\u009cTravellers Joy\u00e2\u0080\u009d--the joy that\nmakes all travellers long to rest in Kent--abode as yet in the hopeful\nbud, a pendent shower of emerald.\n\nThese things were not heeded much, but pleasantly accepted, by the four\nmen and three horses. All felt alike that the world was made for them,\nand for them to enjoy themselves; and little they cared to go into the\nreason, when they had the room for it. With this large sense of what\nought to be, they came to the gate of Old Applewood farm, a great white\ngate with a padlock on it. This stopped the road, and was meant to do\nso; for Martin Lovejoy, Gregory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, claimed the soil of the road\nfrom this point, and denied all right of way, public or even private,\nto all claimants of whatsoever kind. On the other hand the parish\nclaimed it as a public thoroughfare, and two farmers further on vowed\nthat it was an \u00e2\u0080\u009coccupation road;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and what was more they would use it\nas such. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrower Lovejoy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the neighbourhood called him--not that he\nwas likely to grow much more, but because of his cherry-orchards--here\nwas the proper man to hold the gate against all his enemies. When they\nsawed it down, he very promptly replaced it with cast iron; and when\nthis was shattered with a fold-pitcher, he stopped their premature\ntriumph by a massive barrier of wrought metal case-hardened against\nrasp or cold chisel. Moreover he painted it white, so that any\nnocturnal attack might be detected at a greater distance.\n\nWhen Paddy had opened this gate with a key which he had carried to\nLondon, they passed through an orchard of May-Duke cherries, with the\nripe fruit hanging quite over the road. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo wonder you lock the gate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid Lorraine, as Crusty John, now on the box again, handed him a noble\ncluster with the dark juice mantling richly under the ruddy gloss of\nskin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean that we should get them stolen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gregory asked, with some\nindignation; for his Kentish pride was touched: \u00e2\u0080\u009coh, no, we should\nnever get them stolen. Nobody about here would do such a thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Hilary, jumping at another\ncluster; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was born to teach the Kentish public the proper way to\nsteal cherries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, they do take them sometimes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the truthful Gregory confessed;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we never call it stealing, any more than we do what the birds\ntake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cValued fellow-student, thy strong point will not be the criminal law.\nBut you must have a criminal love of the law, to jump at it out of\nthese cherry-trees.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, as you know. Ah, there she is, and my Cousin\nPhyllis!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor the moment Lovejoy forgot his duty to his friend and particular\nguest, and slipping down from the tail of the van, made off at full\nspeed through the cherry-trees. Hilary scarcely knew what to do. The\nlast thing that ever occurred to him was that any one had been rude\nto him; still it was rather unpleasant to drive, or be driven, up to\nthe door of his host, sitting upon a bushel basket, and with no one\nto say who he was. Yet to jump out and run after Gregory, and collar\nhim while he saluted his mother, was even a worse alternative. In a\nvery few moments that chance was gone; for the team, with the scent of\ntheir corn so nigh, broke into a merry canter, and rattled along with\ntheir ears pricked forward, and a pleasant jingling. Neither did they\nstop until they turned into a large farm-yard, with an oast-house at\nthe further end of it. The dwelling-house was of the oldest fashion,\nthatched in the middle, at each end gabled, tiled in some places, and\nat some parts slabbed. Yet, on the whole, it looked snug, dry, and\nhappy. Here, with one accord, halted the nags, and shook themselves in\ntheir harness, and answered the neighs of their friends in the stables.\n\nHilary, laughing at his own plight, but feeling uncommonly stiff in the\nknees, arose from his basket, and looked around; and almost the first\nthing that met his gaze destroyed all his usual presence of mind. This\nwas a glance of deep surprise, mingled with timid inquiry and doubt,\nfrom what Master Hilary felt at once to be the loveliest, sweetest, and\nmost expressive brown eyes in the universe. The young girl blushed\nas she turned away, through fear of having shown curiosity; but the\nrich tint of her cheeks was faint, compared with the colour of poor\nLorraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. That gay youth was taken aback so utterly by the flash of\na moment, that he could not find a word to say, but made pretence in a\nwholesale manner to see nothing at all particular. But the warm blood\nfrom his heart belied him, which he turned away to hide, and worked\namong the baskets briskly, hoping to be looked at, and preparing to\nhave another look as soon as he felt that it could be done.\n\nMeanwhile, that formidable creature, whose glance had produced such a\nfine effect, recovered more promptly from surprise, and felt perhaps\nthe natural pride of success, and desire to pursue the fugitive. At any\nrate, she was quite ready to hear whatever he might have to say for\nhimself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must ask you to forgive me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lorraine began in a nervous manner,\nlifting his hat, and still blushing freely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor springing so suddenly\nout of the earth--or rather, out of this van, I mean; though that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbe right, for I still am in it. I believe that I have the pleasure of\nspeaking to Miss Phyllis Catherow. Your cousin, Mr. Lovejoy, is a very\ngreat friend of mine indeed; and he most kindly asked, or rather, what\nI mean to say is, invited me to come down for a day or two to this\ndelightful part of the world; and I have enjoyed it so much already,\nthat I am sure--that--that in fact----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat I hope you may soon enjoy it more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She did not in the least mean\nany sarcasm or allusion to Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s present state; still he fancied\nthat she did; until the kind look, coming so sweetly from the kind warm\nheart, convinced him that she never could be so cruel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see the most delightful prospect I ever could imagine of enjoying\nmyself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lorraine replied, with a glance, imparting to his harmless\nwords the mischief of that which nowadays we call \u00e2\u0080\u009ca most unwarrantable\npersonal allusion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But she did not, or would not, take it so.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow kind of you to be pleased so lightly! But we do our best, in our\nsimple way, when any one kindly comes to see us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Miss Catherow, I thought from what your cousin said to me that\nyou were only staying here for a little time yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are quite right as to Miss Catherow. But I am not my Cousin\nPhyllis. I am only Mabel Lovejoy, Gregory Lovejoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Jove, how glad I am!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary, in his impetuous way; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat a\nfool I must have been not to know it, after I saw him run to meet his\ncousin in the orchard! But that treacherous Gregory never told me that\nhe even had a sister. Now, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I thoroughly give it to him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must not be angry, Mr. Lorraine, with poor Gregory,\nbecause--because Phyllis is such a beautiful girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let me hear about beautiful girls! As if--as if there could be\nany----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood enough for Gregory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, coming cleverly to his rescue,\nfor he knew that he had gone too far; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut wait till you have seen\nCousin Phyllis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is one thing I shall not defer for the glory of seeing a\nthousand Miss Catherows, and that is the right that I have to shake\nhands with my dear friend Gregory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had leaped from the van some time ago, and now held out his hand (a\ngood strong one, pleasingly veined with cherry-juice), and she, with\nhospitable readiness, laid her pretty palm therein. He felt that it was\na pretty hand, and a soft one, and a hearty one; and he found excuse to\nhold it longer while he asked a question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, how did you know my name, if you please, while I made such a\nstupid mistake about yours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy your bright blue eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she was going to answer, with her native\ntruthfulness; but the gaze of those eyes suggested that the downright\ntruth might be dangerous. Therefore, for once, she met a question with\na question warily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas it likely that I should not know you, after all I have heard of\nyou?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This pleased him well in a general way. For Hilary, though too\nfree (if possible) from conceit and arrogance, had his own little share\nof vanity. Therefore, upon the whole, it was lucky, and showed due\nattention to his business, that Grower Lovejoy now came up, to know\nwhat was doing about the van.\n\nMartin Lovejoy was not a squatter, by seven years stamped into \u00e2\u0080\u009ctenant\nright,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which means very often landlord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong. Nor was he one of\nthose great tenant farmers who, even then, were beginning to rise, and\nhold their own with \u00e2\u0080\u009clanded gentry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His farm was small, when compared\nwith some; but it was outright his own, having descended to him through\nlong-buried generations. So that he was one of the ever-dwindling class\nof \u00e2\u0080\u009cfranklins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a class that has done good work for England, neither\nobtaining nor craving thanks.\n\nOld Applewood farm contained altogether about six hundred acres,\nwhereof at least two-thirds lay sweetly in the Vale of Medway, and\ncould show root, stem, or bine against any other land in Kent, and,\ntherefore, any in England. Here was no fear of the heat of the sun or\nthe furious winter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rages, such a depth of nature underlay the roots\nof everything. Nothing ever suffered from that poverty of blood which\nmakes trees canker on a shallow soil; and no tree rushed into watery\nstrength (which very soon turns to weakness), through having laid hold\nupon something that suited only a particular part of it.\n\nAnd not the trees alone, but all things, grew within that proper usage\nof a regulated power (yet with more of strength to come up, if it\nshould be called for), which has made our land and country fertile\nover all the world; receiving submissively the manners and the manure\nof all nations. This is a thing to be proud of; but the opportunity for\nsuch pride was not open to the British mind at the poor old time now\ndealt with.\n\nMartin Lovejoy knew no more than that the rest of Europe was amassed\nagainst our island; and if England meant to be England, every son of\nthat old country must either fight himself or pay. Martin would rather\nhave fought than paid, if he had only happened to be a score and a half\nyears younger.\n\nHilary Lorraine knew well (when Martin Lovejoy took his hand, and\nwelcomed him to Old Applewood) that here was a man to be relied on, to\nmake good his words and mind. A man of moderate stature, but of sturdy\nframe, and some dignity; ready to meet everybody pretty much as he was\nmet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlad to see you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have often heard of you, Master\nLorraine; it is right kind of you to come down. I hope that you are\nreally hungry, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the last degree,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been eating off and\non, but nothing at all to speak of, in the noble air I have travelled\nthrough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur air has suited you, I see by the colour of your cheeks and eyes.\nAha! the difference begins, as I have seen some scores of times, at\nten miles out of London. And we are nearly thirty here, sir, from that\nmiserable place. Excuse me, Master Lorraine, I hope I say nothing to\noffend you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear sir, how can you offend me? I hate London heartily. There must\nbe a million people there a great deal too good to live in it. We are\ncounting everybody this year; and I hear that when it is made up there\nwill be a million and a quarter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it. There never was such a deal\nbefore. And how can there want to be so many now? This numbering of\nthe people is an unholy thing, that leads to plagues. All the parsons\naround here say that this has brought the comet. And they may show\nsomething for it; and they preach of Jerusalem when it was going to be\ndestroyed. They have frightened all our young maids terribly. What is\nsaid in London, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cScarcely anything, Mr. Lovejoy: scarcely anything at all. We only see\nhim every now and then, because of the smoke between us. And when we\nsee him, we have always got our own work to attend to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWonderful, wonderful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Grower; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho can make out them\nLondoners? About their business they would go, if Korah, Dathan, and\nAbiram were all swallowed up in front of them. For that I like them. I\nlike a man--but come in to our little supper, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nBEAUTIES OF THE COUNTRY.\n\n\nThe next day was Sunday; and Hilary (having brought a small bag of\nclothes with him) spent a good deal of the early time in attending to\nhis adornment. For this he had many good reasons to give, if only he\nhad thought about them; but the only self-examination that occurred to\nhim was at the looking-glass. Here he beheld himself looking clean and\nbright, as he always did look; and yet he was not quite satisfied (as\nhe ought to have been) with his countenance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is room for a lot\nof improvement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed at himself, quite bitterly: \u00e2\u0080\u009chow coarse,\nand how low, I begin to look! But there is not a line in her face\nthat could be changed without spoiling it. There again! Hairs, hairs,\ncoming almost everywhere! Beautiful girls have none of that stuff. How\nthey must despise us! All their hair is ornamental, and ours comes so\ndisgracefully!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen he had no one else to talk to, Hilary always talked to himself.\nHe always believed that he knew himself better than anybody else could\nknow him. And so he had a right to do; and so he must have done just\nnow, if doubtful watch of himself and great shaking of his head could\nhelp him.\n\nAt last he began to be fit to go down, according to his own ideas,\nthough not at all sure that he might not have managed to touch himself\nup just a little bit more--which might make all the difference. He\nthought that he looked pretty well; but still he would have liked\nto ask Gregory before it was too late to make any change, and the\nbeautiful eyes fell upon him. But Gregory, and all the rest, were\nwaiting for him in the breakfast-room; and no one allowed him to\nsuspect how much he had tried their patience.\n\nYoung Lovejoy showed a great deal of skill in keeping Lorraine to the\nother side of the table from Phyllis Catherow; and Hilary was well\ncontent to sit at the side of Mabel. Phyllis, in his opinion, was a\nbeautiful girl enough, and clever in her way, and lively; but \u00e2\u0080\u009clovely\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwas the only word to be used at all about Mabel. And she asked him to\nhave just a spoonful of honey, and to share a pat of butter with her,\nin such a voice, and with such a look, that if she had said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere are\ntwo ounces of cold-drawn castor oil--if you take one, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take the\nother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he must have opened his mouth for it.\n\nSo they went on; and neither knew the deadly sin they were dropping\nto--that deadly sin of loving when the level and entire landscape of\ntwo lives are different.\n\nThrough the rich fields, and across a pretty little wandering brook,\nwhich had no right to make a quarter of the noise it was making, this\nsnug party went to church. Accurate knowledge of what to do, as well as\nvery pretty manners, and a sound resolve to be over-nice (rather than\nincur the possibility of pushing), led the two young men from London\nrather to underdo the stiles, and almost go quite away, than to express\ntheir feelings by hands, whenever the top-bar made a tangle, according\nto the usual knot of it. The two girls entered into this, and said to\nthemselves, what a very superior thing it was to have young men from\nLondon, in comparison with young hop-growers, who stood here and there\nacross them and made them so blush for each inch of their legs. What\nmade it all the more delicate, and ever so much more delightful, was,\nthat the excellent Grower was out of the way, and so was Mrs. Lovejoy.\nFor the latter, being a most kind-hearted woman, had rheumatic pains\nat the first church-bell, all up the leaders of her back; so that the\nstiles were too many for her, and Master Lovejoy was compelled to drive\nher in the one-horse shay.\n\nBy the time these staid young men and maidens came to the little\nchurchyard gate, everything was settled between them, as if by deed\nunder hand and seal, although not so much as a wave of the air, much\nless any positive whisper of the wind, had stirred therein. The import\nof this unspoken and even undreamed covenant was, that Gregory now must\nwalk with Phyllis, and see to her, and look at her, without her having\nany second thoughts concerning Hilary. Hilary, on the other hand, was\nto be acknowledged as the cavalier of Mabel; to help her when she\nwanted helping, and to talk when she wanted talking; although it might\nbe assumed quite fairly that she could do most of that for herself.\nFeeling the strength of good management, all of them marched into\nchurch accordingly.\n\nIn the very same manner they all marched out, after behaving uncommonly\nwell, and scarcely looking at one another, when the clergyman gave\nout that the heat of the weather had not allowed him to write a\nnew discourse that week; but as the same cause must have made them\nforgetful of what he had said last Sunday (when many of them seemed\ninattentive), he now proposed, with the divine assistance, to read the\nsame sermon again to them.\n\nWith the unconverted youthful mind, a spring (like that of\nJack-out-of-the-box) at the outer door of the church jumps up, after\nbeing so long inside, into that liberal goodwill, which is one of our\nnoblest sentiments. Anybody is glad to see almost everybody; and people\n(though of one parish) in great joy forego their jangling. The sense of\na grand relief, and a conscience wiped clean for another week, leads\nthe whole lot to love one another as far as the gate of the churchyard.\n\nBut our young people were much inclined to love one another much\nfurther. The more they got into the meadow-land, and the strength of\nthe summer around them, with the sharp stroke of the sun, and the brisk\nshort shadows of one another, the more they were treading a dangerous\npath, and melting away to each other. Hilary saw with romantic pride\nthat Mabel went on as well as ever, and had not a bead on her clear\nbright cheeks; while at the same time Phyllis, though stopping to rest\nevery now and then--but Hilary never should have noticed this. Such\nthings are below contempt.\n\nIn this old and genial house, the law was that the guest should appoint\nthe time for dinner, whenever the cares of the outer work permitted it.\nAnd as there were no such cares on Sunday, Hilary had to choose the\ntime for the greatest event of the human day. This had been talked of\nand settled, of course, before anybody got the prayer-books; and now\nthe result at two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock was a highly excellent repast. To escape the\npower of the sun they observed this festival in the hall of the house,\nwhich was deliciously cool even now, being paved with stone, and shaded\nby a noble and fragrant walnut-tree. Mrs. Lovejoy knew, what many even\ngood housekeepers seem not to know--to wit that, to keep a room cool,\nit is not necessary to open the windows when the meridian sun bombards.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor goodness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake, let us have some air in such weather as this!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nthey cry, when they might as well say, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us cool the kitchen by\nopening the door of the oven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLorraine was one of those clever fellows who make the best of\neverything; which is the cleverest thing that can be done by a human\nbeing. And he was not yet come to the time of life when nothing is good\nif the dinner is bad; so that he sat down cheerily, and cheered all the\nrest by doing so.\n\nOf course there were many things said and done, which never would have\nbeen said, or thought of, at the dinner-table of Coombe Lorraine. But\nHilary (though of a very sensitive fibre in such matters) neither saw,\nnor heard, nor felt, a single thing that irked him. There was nothing\nlow about anybody; whereas there was something as high as the heavens\nambrosially busy with the very next plate. He made himself (to the very\nutmost of his power) agreeable, except at the moments when his power\nof pleasing quite outran himself. Then he would stop and look at his\nfork--one of the fine old two-pronged fellows--and almost be afraid to\nglance, to ask what she was thinking.\n\nShe was thinking the very things that she should have known so much\nbetter than to think. But what harm could there possibly be in scarcely\nthinking, so much as dreaming, things that could have nothing in them?\nWho was she, a country-girl, to set herself up, and behave herself,\nas if anybody meant anything? And yet his eyes, and the bend of his\nhead, and his choice of that kidney-potato for her (as if he were born\na grower)--and then the way he poured her beer--if there was nothing\nin all this, why then there was nothing in all the world, save empty\ndelusion and breaking of heart.\n\nHilary, sitting at her knife-hand, felt a whole course of the like\nemotions, making allowance for gender. How beautifully she played\nher knife, with a feminine tenderness not to make a cruel slice of\nanything! And how round her little wrist was, popping in and out of\nsleeves, according as the elbow went; and no knob anywhere to be seen,\nsuch as women even of the very latest fashion have. And then her hair\nwas coming towards him (when she got a bit of gristle) so that he could\ntake a handful, if the other people only would have the manners not\nto look. And oh, what lovely hair it was! so silky, and so rich, and\nbright, and full of merry dances to the music of her laugh! And he did\nnot think he had ever seen anything better than her style of eating,\nwithout showing it. Clearly enjoying her bit of food, and tempting all\nto feed their best; yet full of mind at every mouthful, and of heart at\nevery help. But above all, when she looked up, quite forgetting both\nknife and fork, and looked as if she could look like that into no other\neyes but his; with such a gentle flutter, and a timid wish to tell no\nmore, and yet a sudden pulse of glad light from the innocent young\nheart--nothing could be lovelier than the way in which she raised her\neyes, except her way of dropping them.\n\nThese precious glances grew more rare and brief the more he sought for\nthem; and he wondered whether anybody else ever could have been treated\nso. Then, when he would seem to be doubtful, and too much inclined to\nstop, a look of surprise, or a turn of the head, would tempt him to go\non again. And there would be little moments (both on his side and on\nhers) of looking about at other people with a stealthy richness. With\na sense of some great treasure, made between them, and belonging to\nthemselves in private; a proud demand that the rest of the world should\nattend to its proper business; and then, with one accord, a meeting of\nthe eyes that were beginning, more and more, to mean alike.\n\nAll this was as nice as could be, and a pretty thing to see. Still, in\na world that always leaves its loftiest principles to accumulate, at\nthe lowest interest (and once in every generation to be a mere drug\nin the market), \u00e2\u0080\u009clove\u00e2\u0080\u009d is used, not in games alone, as the briefest\nform of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All our lovers (bred as lovers must be under school\nboards) know what they are after now, and who can pay the ninepence.\nBut in the ancient time, the mothers had to see to most of that.\n\nMrs. Lovejoy, though she did not speak, or look particularly, had her\nown opinion as to what was going on close by. And she said to herself,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will see to this. It is no good interfering now. I shall have Miss\nMabel all to myself in three-quarters of an hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nOH, RUDDIER THAN THE CHERRY!\n\n\nMrs. Lovejoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lecture to her daughter seemed likely to come just a\nlittle too late, as so many excellent lessons do. For as soon as he\nsaw that all had dined, the host proposed an adjournment, which was\nwelcomed with no small delight by all except the hostess.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Master Lorraine, and my niece Phyllis, what say you, if we gather\nour fruit for ourselves in the shady places; or rather, if we sit on\nthe bank of the little brook in the orchard, where there is a nice\nsheltered spot; and there we can have a glass of wine while the maidens\npick the fruit for us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCapital,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat a fine idea, Mr. Lovejoy! But surely\nwe ought to pick for the ladies, instead of letting them pick for us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir, we will let them have the pleasure of waiting upon us. It is\nthe rule of this neighbourhood, and ought to be observed everywhere.\nWe work for the ladies all the week, serve, honour, and obey them. On\nSundays they do the like for us, and it is a very pleasant change.\nMabel, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget the pipes. Do you smoke, Master Lorraine? If so, my\ndaughter will fill a pipe for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat would be enough to tempt me, even if I disliked it, whereas I\nam very fond of it. However, I never do smoke, because my father has\na most inveterate prejudice against it. I promised him some time ago\nto give it up for a twelvemonth. And the beauty of it is that there is\nnothing he himself enjoys so much as a good pinch of snuff. Ah, there I\nam getting my revenge upon him. My sister will do anything I ask her;\nand he will do anything she asks him: and so, without his knowledge, I\nam breaking him of his snuff-box.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha, well done! I like that. And I like you too, young man, for your\nobedience to your father. That virtue is becoming very rare; rarer and\nrarer every year. Why, if my father had knocked me down I should have\nlain on the ground, if it was a nettle-bed, till he told me to get up.\nNow, Greg, my boy, what would you do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir, I think that I should get up as quick as I could, and tell\nmy mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha! and I should have the nettles then. Well said, Greg, my boy; I\nbelieve it is what all the young fellows nowadays would do. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nmean you, of course, Master Lorraine. Come along, come along. Mabel,\nyou know where that old Madeira is that your poor Uncle Ambrose took\nthree times to Calcutta. Ah, poor man, I wish he was here! As fine a\nfellow as ever shotted a cannon at a Frenchman. Nelson could have done\nno better. And it did seem uncommonly hard upon him never to go to\nchurchyard. However, the will of the Lord be done! Now mind, the new\npatent cork-screw.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMabel was only too glad to get this errand to the cellar. With filial\ninstinct she perceived how likely she was to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccatch it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as soon as\nher mother got the chance. Not that she deserved it. Oh no, not in the\nleast; her conscience told her that much. Was she to be actually rude\nto her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guest, and her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend? And as if she was not\nold enough now, at eighteen and a quarter, to judge for herself in such\nchildish matters as how to behave at dinner-time!\n\nBy the side of a pebbly brook--which ran within stone-throw of the\nhouse, sparkling fresh and abundant from deep well-springs of the\nhill-range--they came to a place which seemed to be made especially\nfor enjoyment: a bend of the grassy banks and rounded hollow of the\nfruit-land, where cherry, and apple, and willow-tree clubbed their\nhospitable shade, and fugitive water made much ado to quiver down\nthe zigzag rill. Here in cool and gentle shelter, the Grower set his\nfour legs down; _i.e._, the four legs of his chair, because, like\nall that in gardens dwell, he found mother earth too rheumatic for\nhim, especially in hot weather when deep sluggish fibres radiate. The\nGroweress also had her chair, borne by the sedulous Hilary. All the\nrest, like nymphs and shepherds, strewed their recumbent forms on turf.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod Almighty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master Lovejoy, fearing that he might be taking\nit too easy for the Sabbath-day, \u00e2\u0080\u009creally hath made beautiful things\nfor us His creatures to rejoice in, with praise, thanksgiving, and\nfruitfulness. Mabel, put them two bottles in the brook--not there, you\nstupid child; can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see that the sun comes under that old root? In\nthe corner where that shelf of stone is. Thank you, Master Lorraine.\nWhat a thing it is to have a headpiece! But God Almighty never made,\namong all His wonderful infinite works, the waters and the great\nwhales, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit, whose seed is in itself, and\nthe green herb for meat, which means to come to table with the meat;\nHis mercy endureth for ever; and He never showed it as when He made\ntobacco, and clay for tobacco pipes--the white clay that He made man\nof.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With this thanksgiving he began to smoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Martin, I never could see that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mrs. Lovejoy; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe best\nand greatest work of the Lord ought to have been for the women first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood wife, then it must have been the apple. Ah, Gregory, I had your\nmother there! However, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dispute on a Sunday; it spoils all the\ngoodness of going to church, and never leaves anything settled. Mabel,\nrun away now for the fruit, while Gregory feels if the wine is cold.\nMaster Lorraine, I hope our little way of going on, and being over free\non a Sunday perhaps, does not come amiss to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary did not look as if anything came amiss to him, as now he lay at\nthe feet of Mabel, on the slope of the sweet rich sward, listening only\nfor her voice, more liquid than even the tone of the brook. He listened\nfor it, but not to it; inasmuch as one of those sudden changes, which\n(at less than half a breath) vapour the glass of the feminine mind,\nwas having its turn with the maiden. Mabel felt that she had not kept\nherself to herself, as she should have done. Who was this gentleman,\nor what, that she should be taken with him so suddenly as to feel her\nbreath come short, every time that she even thought of her mother? A\ngentleman from London too, where the whole time of the Court was spent,\nas Master Shorne brought news every week, in things that only the\nmarried women were allowed to hear of. In the present case, of course,\nshe knew how utterly different all things were. How lofty and how grand\nof heart, how fearful even to look at her much--still, for all that, it\nwould only be wise to show him, or at least to let him see--that at any\nrate, for the present----\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Mabel, when are you going for the cherries? Phyllis--bless my\nheart alive! Gregory, are you gone to sleep? What are all the young\npeople made of, when a touch of summer spreads them only fit to sprawl\nabout?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBring three sorts of cherries Mabel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gregory shouted after her; \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr.\nLorraine must be tired of May-Dukes, I am sure. The Black Geans must\nbe ripe, and the Eltons, and the Early Amber. And go and see how the\nWhite-hearts are on the old tree against the wall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch he knows about cherries, I believe!\u00e2\u0080\u009d grumbled Mr. Lovejoy; \u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn\nDoe and Richard Roe be more to his liking than the finest Griffins.\nWhy, the White-hearts haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done stoning yet! What can the boy be\nthinking of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was the Grower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading grievance that neither of\nhis two sons seemed likely to take to the business after him. Here was\nthe elder being turned by his mother into a \u00e2\u0080\u009cthieves\u00e2\u0080\u0099 counsellor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nthe younger was away at sea, and whenever he came home told stories\nof foreign fruit which drove his father into a perfect fury. So that\nnow it was Martin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main desire to marry his only daughter to some one\nfitted to succeed him, who might rent the estate from Gregory the heir;\nfor the land had been disgavelled.\n\nIt is a pleasing thing to a young man--ay, and an old one may be\npleased--to see a pretty girl make herself useful in pretty and natural\nattitudes; and that pleasure now might be enjoyed at leisure and in\nduplicate. For Phyllis Catherow was a pretty, or rather a beautiful\nyoung woman, slender, tall, and fair of hue. Not to be compared with\nMabel, according to Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s judgment; but infinitely superior to her,\nin the opinion of Gregory. All that depends upon taste, of course; but\nMabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beauty was more likely to outlast the flush of youth, having\nthe keeping qualities of a bright and sweet expression, and the kind\nlustre of sensible eyes.\n\nThese two went among the cherry-trees, with fair knowledge what to do,\nand having light scarves on their heads, brought behind their ears and\ntied under the curves of their single chins. Because they knew that the\nspars and sprays would spoil their lovely Sunday hats, even without\nthe drip of a cherry wounded by some thirsty thrush. The blackbirds\npop them off entire, and so do the starlings; but the thrushes sit and\npeck at them, with the juice dripping down on their dappled breasts,\nand a flavour in their throats, which they mean to sing about at\ntheir leisure. But now the birds, that were come among them, meant to\nhave them wholesale. Phyllis, being a trifle taller, and less deft of\nfinger, bent the shady branches down, for Mabel to pluck the fruit.\nMabel knew that she must take the northern side of the trees, of\ncourse; and the boughs where the hot sun had not beaten through the\nleaves and warmed the fruit. Also she knew that she must not touch\nthe fruit with her hand and dim the gloss; but above all things to be\ncareful--as of the goose with the golden eggs--to make no havoc of the\nyoung buds forming, at the base of every cluster, for the promise of\nnext year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crop.\n\nHilary longed to go and help them; but his host being very proud of\nthe grandeur of his Madeira wine, would not even hear of it. And Mrs.\nLovejoy, for other reasons, showed much skill in holding him; so that\nhe could but sit down and admire the picture he longed to be part of.\nHence he beheld, in the happy distance, in and out the well-fed trees,\nskill, and grace, and sprightly movements, tiny baskets lifted high,\nround arms bent for drawing downward, or thrown up for a jumping catch,\nand everything else that is so lovely, and safe to admire at a distance.\n\nBy-and-by the maids came back, bearing their juicy treasure, and blithe\nwith some sage mysticism of laughter. They had hit upon some joke\nbetween them, or something that chanced to tickle them; and when this\nhappens with girls, they never seem to know when the humour is out of\nit; and of course they make the deepest mystery of a diminutive jest so\nharmless that it hits no one except themselves. Mrs. Lovejoy looked at\nthem strongly. Her time for common-sense was come; and she thought they\nwere stealing a march upon her, by some whispers about young men, the\nlast thing they should ever think of.\n\nWhereas the poor girls had no thought of anything of the kind. Neither\nwould they think one atom more than they could help, of what did not\nin the least concern them; if their elders, who laid down the law,\nwould only leave them to themselves. And it was not long till this\ndelightful discretion was afforded them. For, after a glass or two of\nwine, the heat of the day began to tell, through the cool air of the\nhollow, on that worthy couple, now kindly hand in hand, and calmly\ngoing down the slope of life. They hoped they had got a long way to go\nyet; and each thought so of the other. Neither of them had much age,\nbeing well under threescore years; just old enough to begin to look\non the generation judiciously. But having attained this right at last,\nafter paying heavily, what good could they have of it, if young people\nwere ever so far beyond their judgment? Meditating thus they dozed;\nand youthful voice, and glance, and smile, were drowned in the melody\nof--nose.\n\nThe breeze that comes in the afternoon of every hot day (unless the\nsky is hushing up for a thunderstorm) began to show the underside of\nleaves and the upper gloss of grass, and with feeble puffs to stir the\nstagnant heat into vibration, like a candle quivering. Every breath at\nfirst was hot, and only made the air feel hotter, until there arrived a\nrefreshing current, whether from some water-meadows, or from the hills\nwhere the chalk lay cool.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe heat is gone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martin Lovejoy, waking into the pleasant\nchange; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit will be a glorious afternoon. Pooh, what is this to call\nhot weather? Only three years ago, in 1808, I remember well----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may have been hotter then, my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Lovejoy, placidly;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it did not make you forget your pipe, and be ungrateful to\nProvidence about me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, where can the children be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Grower. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought they\nwere all here just this moment! It is wonderful how they get away\ntogether. I thought young Lorraine and Gregory were as fast asleep as\nyou or I! Oh, there, I hear them in the distance, with the girls, no\ndoubt, all alive and merry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, and a little too merry, I doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mrs. Lovejoy; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca little\ntoo much alive for me. Why, they must be in the wall-garden now!\nGoodness, alive, I believe they are, and nobody to look after them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if they are, they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do much harm. They are welcome to\nanything they can find, except the six strawberries I crossed, and\nMabel will see that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat those.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCrossed strawberries indeed! now, Martin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Mrs. Lovejoy never could\nbe brought to understand cross-breeding;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do something\nworse than cross your strawberries, unless you keep a little sharper\nlook-out. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cross your plans, Master Martin Lovejoy, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad\nluck for any one who does that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand you, wife, any more than you understand the\nstrawberries. How could they cross them at this time of year?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see that this gay young Lorraine is falling over head\nand ears in love with our darling Mabel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhew! That would be a sad affair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Grower answered carelessly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nlike the young fellow, and should be sorry to have him so disappointed.\nFor of course he never could have our Mab, unless he made up his mind\nto turn grower. Shorne says that he is a born salesman; perhaps he is\nalso a born grower.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, husband, why do you vex me so? You know as well as I do that he\nis the only son of a baronet, belonging, as Gregory says, to one of\nthe proudest families in England; though he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show much pride\nhimself, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certain. Is it likely they would let him have Mabel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it likely that we would let Mabel have him? But this is all\nnonsense, wife; you are always discovering such mare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-nests. Tush!\nwhy, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall in love with you till we fell off a horse three\ntimes together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that, of course. But that was because they wanted us to do\nit. The very thing is that it happens at once when everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face\nis against it. However, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had your warning, Martin, and you only\nlaugh at it. You have nobody but yourself to thank, if it goes against\nyour plots and plans. For my own part, I should be well pleased if\nMabel were really fond of him, and if the great people came round in\nthe end, as sooner or later they always do. There are very few families\nin the kingdom that need be ashamed of my daughter, I think. And he is\na most highly accomplished young man. He said last night immediately\nafter prayer-time that I might try for an hour, and he would be most\nhappy to listen to me, but I never, never could persuade him that I was\nover forty years old. Therefore, husband, see to it yourself. Things\nmay take their own course for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrust me, trust me, good wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can see, as far as\nmost folk can. What stupes boys and girls are, to be sure, to go\nrushing about after watery fruit, and leave such wine as this here\nMadeira. Have another glass, my dear good creature, to cheer you up\nafter your prophecies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMeanwhile, in the large old-fashioned garden, which lay at the east\nend of the house, further up the course of the brook, any one sitting\namong the currant-bushes might have judged which of the two was right,\nthe unromantic franklin, or his more ambitious but sensible wife.\nGregory and Phyllis were sitting quietly in a fine old arbour, having a\nsteady little flirt of their own, and attending to nothing in the world\nbesides. Phyllis was often of a pensive cast, and she never looked\nbetter than in this mood, when she felt the deepest need of sympathy.\nThis she was receiving now, and pretending of course not to care for\nit; her fingers played with moss and bark, the fruits of the earth were\nbelow her contempt, and she looked too divine for anybody.\n\nOn the other hand, the rarest work and the most tantalizing tricks were\ngoing on, at a proper distance, between young Mabel and Hilary. They\nhad straggled off into the strawberry-beds, where nobody could see\nthem; and there they seemed likely to spend some hours if nobody should\ncome after them. The plants were of the true Carolina, otherwise called\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cold scarlet pine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which among all our countless new sorts finds\nno superior, perhaps no equal; although it is now quite out of vogue,\nbecause it fruits so shyly.\n\nWhat says our chief authority?[1] \u00e2\u0080\u009cFruit medium-sized, ovate, even,\nand regular, and with a glossy neck, skin deep red, flesh pale red,\nvery firm and solid, with a fine sprightly and very rich pine flavour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhat lovelier fruit could a youth desire to place between little pearly\nteeth, reserving the right to have a bite, if any of the very firm\nflesh should be left? What fruit more suggestive of elegant compliments\ncould a maid open her lips to receive, with a dimple in each mantled\ncheek--lips more bright than the skin of the fruit, cheeks by no\nmeans of a pale red now, although very firm and solid--and as for the\nsprightly flavour of the whole, it may be imagined, if you please, but\nis not to be ascertained as yet?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, I must pick a few for you, Mr. Lorraine. You are really giving me\nall you find. And they are so scarce--no, thank you; I can get up very\nnicely by myself. And there can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be any brier in my hair. You really\ndo imagine things. Where on earth could it have come from? Well, if you\nare sure, of course you may remove it. Now I verily believe you put it\nthere. Well, perhaps I am wronging you. It was an unfair thing to say,\nI confess. Now wait a moment, while I run to get a little cabbage-leaf!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA cabbage leaf! Now you are too bad. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taste so much as the\ntip of a strawberry out of anything but one. How did you eat your\nstrawberries, pray?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith my mouth, of course. But explain your meaning. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat what\nI pick for you out of what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut of anything else in the world except your own little beautiful\npalm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, how very absurd you are! Why, my hands are quite hot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me feel them and judge for myself. Now the other, if you please.\nOh, how lovely and cool they are! How could you tell me such a story,\nMabel, beautiful Mabel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not at all beautiful, and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be called so. And I know not\nwhat they may do in London. But I really think, considering--at least\nwhen one comes to consider that----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo consider what? You make me tremble, you do look so ferocious. Ah, I\nthought you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it long. Inconsiderate creature, what is it I\nam to consider?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot consider! Well, then, remember. Remember, it is not\ntwenty-four hours since you saw me for the very first time; and surely\nit is not right and proper that you should begin to call me \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mabel,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as\nif you had known me all your life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must have known you all my life. And I mean to know you all the rest\nof my life, and a great deal more than that----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be because you are Gregory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend you are allowed to do\nthings. But what would you think of me, Mr. Lorraine, if I were to call\nyou \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099--a thing I should never even dream of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think that you were the very kindest darling, and I should\nask you to breathe it quite into my ear--\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hilary, Hilary!\u00e2\u0080\u0099--just like\nthat; and then I should answer just like this, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mabel, Mabel, sweetest\nMabel, how I love you, Mabel!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and then what would you say, if you\nplease?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should have to ask my mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the maiden, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat I ought\nto say. But luckily the whole of this is in your imagination. Mr.\nLorraine, you have lost your strawberries by your imagination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do I care for strawberries?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hilary cried, as the quick girl\nwisely beat a swift retreat from him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou never can enter into my\nfeelings, or you never would run away like that. And I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run after\nyou, you know, because of Phyllis and Gregory. There she goes, and she\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come back. What a fool I was to be in such a hurry! But what\ncould I do to help it? I never know where I am when she turns those\ndeep rich eyes upon me. She never will show them again, I suppose, but\nkeep the black lashes over them. And I was getting on so well--and here\nare the stalks of the strawberries!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOf every strawberry she had eaten from his daring fingers he had kept\nthe stalk and calyx, breathed on by her freshly fragrant breath, and\nslyly laid them in his pocket; and now he fell to at kissing them. Then\nhe lay down in the Carolinas, where her skirt had moved the leaves; and\nto him, weary with strong heat, and a rush of new emotions, comfort\ncame in the form of sleep. And when he awoke, in his open palm most\ndelicately laid he found a little shell-shaped cabbage-leaf piled with\nthe fruit of the glossy neck.\n\n[1] That admirable writer, Dr. Hogg.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nOH, SWEETER THAN THE BERRY!\n\n\nThese doings of Hilary and his love--for his love he declared her to\nbe for ever, whether she would have him for hers or not--seem to have\ntaken more time almost in telling than in befalling. Although it had\nbeen a long summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day, to them it had passed as a rapid dream. So\nat least they fancied, when they began to look quietly back at it,\nforgetting the tale of the golden steps so lightly flitted over by the\nwinged feet of love.\n\nMartin Lovejoy watched his daughter at supper-time that Sunday; and he\nfelt quite sure that his wife was wrong. Why, the girl scarcely spoke\nto Lorraine at all, and even neglected his plate so sadly, that her\nmother was compelled to remind her sharply of her duties. Upon which\nthe Grower despatched to his wife a smile of extreme sagacity, which\n(being fetched out of cipher and shorthand, by the matrimonial key)\ncontained all this,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell you are a silly, as you always are, when\nyou want to advise me. The girl is cold-shouldering that young fellow,\nthe same as she does all the young hop-growers. And well she knows how\nto do it too. She gets her intellect from her father. Now please not to\nput in your oar, Mrs. Lovejoy, another time, till it is asked for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMoreover, he thought that if Mabel took the smallest delight in Hilary,\nshe could not have answered as she had done, when that pious youth,\nin the early evening, expressed his sincere desire to attend another\nperformance of Divine service.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had no idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the simple Gregory, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you made a point of\ngoing to church at least twice every Sunday. I seldom see you of a\nSunday in London. But the very last place I should go to, to find you,\nwould probably be the Temple church.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is quite a different thing, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see? A country church, and\na church in London, are as different as a meadow and a market-place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut surely, Mr. Lorraine, you would find the duty of attending just\nthe same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thus spoke Mrs. Lovejoy, who seldom missed a chance of\ndischarging her duty towards young people.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite so, of course I do, Mrs. Lovejoy. But then we always perform\nour duties best, when they are pleasures. And besides that, I have a\nspecial reason for feeling bound, as one might say, to go to church\nwell in the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose one must not venture to ask you what that reason is, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, to be sure. It is just this. I have an uncle, my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbrother, who is a country clergyman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell done, Master Lorraine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Grower, while the rest were\nlaughing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou take a very sensible view, sir, of things. It is too\nmuch the fashion nowadays to neglect our trade-connections. But Gregory\nwill go with you, and Phyllis, and Mabel. The old people stay at home\nto mind the house. For we always let the maid-servants go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mabel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor Phyllis is so overcome by the heat,\nthat she must not go. And I must stop at home to read to her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo that the good Lorraine took nothing by his sudden religious fervour,\nexcept a hot walk with Gregory, and a wearisome doze in a musty pew\nwith nobody to look at.\n\nWith fruit-growers, Monday is generally the busiest day of the week,\nexcept Friday. After paying all hands on the Saturday night, and\nstowing away all implements, they rest them well till the Sunday is\nover, having in the summer-time earned their rest by night-work as well\nas day-work, through the weary hours of the week. This is not the case\nwith all, of course. Many of them, especially down in Kent, grow their\nfruit, or let it grow itself, and then sell it by the acre, or the\nhundred acres, to dealers, who take all the gathering and marketing\noff their hands altogether. But for those who work off their own crops,\nthe toil of the week begins before the daystar of the Monday. At least\nfor about six weeks it is so, according to the weather and the length\nof the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbusy season.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Before the stars fade out of the sky, the pickers\nadvance through the strawberry quarters, carrying two punnets each,\nyawning more than chattering even, whisking the grey dew away with\ntheir feet, startling the lark from his nest in the row, groping among\nthe crisp leaves for the fruit, and often laying hold of a slug instead.\n\nThat is the time for the true fruit-lover to try the taste of a\nstrawberry. It should be one that refused to ripen in the gross heat of\nyesterday, but has been slowly fostering goodness, with the attestation\nof the stars. And now (if it has been properly managed, properly picked\nwithout touch of hand, and not laid down profanely), when the sun\ncomes over the top of the hedge, the look of that strawberry will be\nthis--at least, if it is of a proper sort. The beard of the footstalk\nwill be stiff, the sepals of the calyx moist and crisp, the neck will\nshow a narrow band of varnish, where the dew could find no hold, the\nbelly of the fruit will be sleek and gentle, firm however to accept its\nfate; but the back that has dealt with the dew, and the sides where the\ncolour of the back slopes downward, upon them such a gloss of cold and\ndiamond chastity will lie, that the human lips get out of patience with\nthe eyes in no time.\n\nEverybody was so busy with the way the work went on, all for their\nvery life pretending scarcely to have time to breathe, whenever the\nmaster looked at them, that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cberries\u00e2\u0080\u009d were picked, and packed, and\nstarted, long before the sun grew hot--started on the road to London,\nthe cormorant of the universe.\n\nHilary helped with all his heart; enjoying it, with that triumphant\nentrance into any novelty, which always truly distinguished him. He\ncarried his punnets, and kept his row (as soon as they had shown him\nhow), as well as the very best of them, dividing his fruit into firsts,\nand seconds, and keeping the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoppers\u00e2\u0080\u009d separate. Of course he broke off\nmany trusses entire--ripe fruit, green fruit, and barren blossom--until\nhe learned how to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeet his nails,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and how much drag to put on the\nstalks. A clever fellow learns all that from an hour or two of practice.\n\nBut one thing there is which the cleverest fellows can learn by no\nexperience--how to carry the head for hours upside down without hurting\nit. How to make the brain so hard that it cannot shift; or else so\nsoft that the top is as good as the bottom. The question is one for\na great physician; who, to understand it, must keep his row, and\npick by the job. Then let him say if he has learned how to explain\nthe well-established fact that a woman can pick twice as fast as a\nman; for who could assent to the reason assigned by one of themselves\nmagnanimously--that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwomen was generally always used to keep their\nheads turned upside down\u00e2\u0080\u009d?\n\nLeaving such speculative inquiries to go on for ever, Hilary (who knew\nbetter than to say a word about them) came in for his breakfast at six\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and ate it as thoroughly as he had earned it. The master, a\nman of true Kentish fibre, obstinate, placable, hearty, and dry, made\nknown to his wife and to everybody else his present opinion of Hilary.\nMartin Lovejoy never swore. He never went beyond \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod knows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nLord in heaven look down on us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or some other good exclamation,\nsanctioned by the parish vicar. As a general rule--proved by many\nexceptions--the Kentish men seldom swear very hard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeart alive, young sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, piling Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plate, as he\nspoke, with the jellied delights of cold pigeon pie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have been the\nbest man of the morning. Ah! don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you be in a hurry, good wife. No\ntea or coffee our way, thank ye. No, nor any cask-wash. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked\na little too hard for that. Mabel, whatever has come to you, that you\nkeep always out of the way so? And I never saw you anigh the baskets.\nNow don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pipe your eye, child. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to scold thee, if thou\ndidst have a little lie-a-bed. Here, take this here key, child. A\nwink\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as good as a nod--ah, she knows pretty well what to do with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor Mabel was glad to turn away as quickly as possible, after a\nlittle well-managed curtsey to Hilary, whom she had not seen for the\nmorning--certainly through no fault of his--and without a word she\nwent to the dresser (for in these busy times they took their breakfast\nwisely in the kitchen), and from the wooden crook unhung a quaint\nlittle jug, with a narrow neck and a silver lip and handle. With\nthis she set off down a quiet passage and some steps to a snug stone\ncellar, where the choicest of the home-brewed ale was kept. Although\nit lay well beneath the level of the ground, and no ray of sun pierced\nthe wired lattice, the careful mistress of the house had the barrels\nswathed closely with wetted sacks. The girl, with her neat frock\ngathered up--for she always was cleanliness itself--went carefully to\nthe corner cask, and lifted the wet sack back from the head, lest any\ndirty water should have the chance of dripping upon her sleeve. Then\nshe turned the tap, and a thin bright thread ran out of it sideways,\nbeing checked by some hops in the tube perhaps, or want of air at the\nvent-peg. But Mabel held the jug with all patience, although her hand\nshook just a little.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Grower, to Hilary, when she came back and placed the\njug at her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side without a word, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster Lorraine, let me pour\nyou a drop, not to be matched in Kent; nor yet in all England, I do\nbelieve. Home-grown barley, and home-grown hops, and the soft water out\nof the brook that has taken the air of the sky for seven mile or more,\nwithout a drain anigh it. Ah, those brewers can never do that! They\nmust buy their malt, and their musty hops, and pump up their water, and\nboil it down, to get the flint-stones out of it. But our brook hath\ncast the flint-stones and the other pebbles all along. That makes a\nsight of difference, sir. Every water is full of stones, and if you\npump it up from the spring, the stones be all alive in it. But let it\nrun seven miles or eight, and then it is fit to brew with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, to be sure. Now that explains a great many things I never\nunderstood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hilary would have swallowed a camel, rather than argue, at\nthis moment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung sir, just let me prove it to you. Just see the colour it runs\nout, and the way the head goes creaming! Lord, ha\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mercy, if she has\ngived us a glass, or a stag\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horn from the mantelpiece! Why, Mabel,\nchild--Mabel, art thou gone? Why nobody wants to poison thee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think, sir, I saw your daughter go round the corner by the\nwarming-pan, this side of where the broom hangs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen all I can say is, she is daft. She worked very hard last week,\npoor thing. And yesterday she was a-moving always, when the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day\nbids us rest. I must beg your pardon, Master Lorraine. Our Kentish\nmaids always look after our guests. When I was at school, I read in the\ngrammar that the moon always managed the women; but now I do believe it\nis the comet. Let the comet come, say I. When the markets are so bad,\nI feel that I am ready to face almost anything. And now we must drink\nfrom the jug, I reckon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary saw that his host was vexed; but he felt quite certain in his\nown heart that Mabel could never be so rude, or show such resentment\nof any little excess of honey on his part, as to go away in that sour\nearnest, and make the two of them angry. A dozen things might have\nhappened to upset her, or turn her a little askew; and her own father\nought to know her better than he seemed to do. And lo, ere the Grower\nhad quite finished grumbling, Mabel reached over his shoulder unseen,\nand set his own pet glass before him; and then round Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side she\nslid, without ever coming too nigh him, and the glass of honour of the\nhouse, cut in countless facets, twinkled, like the Pleiads, at him!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAdorn me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Grower; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow I call that a true good girl! Girls\nwere always made, Master Lorraine, for the good of those around them.\nIf anybody treats them any way else, they come to nothing afterwards.\nMabel, dear, give me a kiss. You deserve it; and there it is for you.\nNow be off, like a good maid, and see what they be at in Vale Orchard,\nwhile Master Lorraine and I think a bit over these here two glasses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe rest of the day was much too busy, and too much crowded with\nsharp eyes, for any fair chance of love-making. For they all set to\nat the cherry-trees, with ladders, crooks, and hanging baskets, and\nlight boys to scale the more difficult antlers, strip them, and drop\nupon feather-beds. And though the sun broke hot and bright through\nthe dew-cloud of the morning, and quickly drank the beaded freshness\noff the face of herb and tree, yet they picked, and piled, and packed\n(according to their sort and size) the long-stalked dancers that fringe\nthe bough, and glance in the sun so ruddily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must have had a deal too much of this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d young Lovejoy said to\nHilary, when the noon-day meal had been spread forth, and dealt with,\nin a patch of fern near a breezy clump: \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I had worked as you have\ndone, my fingers would scarcely have been fit for a quill, this side of\nnext Hilary term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear fellow, be not, I pray you, so violently facetious. The brain,\nwhen outraged, takes longer to resume its functions than the fingers\ndo. Moreover, I trust that my fingers will hold something nobler than a\nquill, ere the period of my namesake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Hilary charged at Agincourt; I hope you will do nothing of the\nsort;\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gregory, with unwitting and unprecedented poetry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLovejoy, my wits are unequal altogether to this encounter. The\nbrilliancy of your native soil has burst out so upon you, that I must\ngo back to the Southdown hills before I dare point a dart with you.\nNevertheless, on your native soil, I beat you at picking cherries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat you do, and strawberries too. And still more so at eating them!\nBut if you please, you must stop a little. My mother begs, as a great\nfavour, to have a little private talk with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bright face lost its radiance, as his conscience pricked him.\nWas it about Mabel? Of course it must be. And what the dickens was he\nto say? He could not say a false thing. That was far below his nature.\nAnd he must own that he did love Mabel; and far worse than that--had\ndone his utmost to drag that young and innocent Mabel into love with\nhim. And if he were asked about his father--as of course he must be--on\nthe word of a true man he must confess that his father would be sadly\nbitter if he married below his rank in life: also, that though he was\nthe only son, there were very peculiar provisions in the settlement\nof the Lorraine estates, which might throw him entirely upon his own\nwits, if his father turned against him: also, that though his father\nwas one of the very best men in the world, and the kindest and loftiest\nyou could find; still there was about him something of a cold and\ndetermined substance. And worst of all (if the whole truth was to be\nshelled out, as he must unshell it), he knew in his heart that his\nfather loved his sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little finger more than all the members put\ntogether of his own too lively frame.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nVERY SHY THINGS.\n\n\nMrs. Lovejoy sat far away from all the worry, and flurry, and fun of\npicking, and packing, and covering up. She had never entirely given\nherself to the glories of fruit-growing; and she never could be much\nconvinced that any glory was in it. She belonged to a higher rank of\nlife than any of such sons of Cain. Her father had been a navy-captain;\nand her cousin was Attorney-General. This office has always been\nconfounded, in the provincial mind, with rank in a less pugnacious\nprofession. Even Mrs. Lovejoy thought, when the land was so full of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cmilitiamen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that her cousin was the General of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDevil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Own\u00e2\u0080\u009d of\nthe period. Therefore she believed herself to know more than usual\nabout the law; as well as the army, and of course the navy. And this\nhigh position in the legal army of so near a relation helped, no doubt,\nto foster hopes of the elevation of Gregory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon, Mr. Lorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began, as Hilary entered the\nbower, to which she had just retired, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor calling you away from a\nscene, which you enjoy perhaps from its novelty; and where you make\nyourself, I am sure, so exceedingly active and useful. But I feared, as\nyou must unluckily so very soon return to London, that I might have no\nother chance of asking what your candid opinion is upon a matter I have\nvery near at heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeuce and all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Hilary within himself, being even more vexed\nthan relieved by this turn of incidence; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is much cleverer than I\nthought. Instead of hauling me over the coals, she is going to give me\nthe sack at once; and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean to go, for a week at least!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs.\nLovejoy enjoyed his surprise, as he stammered that any opinion he could\nform was entirely at her service.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure that you know what it is about. You must have guessed at\nonce, of course, when I was rude enough to send for you, what subject\nis nearest to a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart. I wish to ask you, what they think of\nmy son Gregory, in London.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLorraine, for the moment, was a little upset. His presence of mind had\nbeen worked so hard, that it was beginning to flutter and shift. And\nmuch as he liked his fellow-pupil, he had not begun to consider him yet\nas a subject of public excitement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think--I really think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, while waiting for time to think\nmore about it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat he is going on as well as ever could be expected,\nma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIf he had wanted to vex his hostess--which to his kind nature would\nhave been one of the last things wanted--he scarcely could have hit on\na phrase more fitted for his purpose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Mr. Lorraine, that is exactly what the monthly nurses say! I hope\nyou can say something a little better than that of Gregory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI assure you, Mrs. Lovejoy, nothing can be finer than the way he is\ngoing on. His attention, punctuality, steadiness, and everything else,\nleave nothing to be desired, as all the wine-merchants always say. Mr.\nMalahide holds him up as a pattern to be avoided, because he works so\nhard; and I think that he really ought to have country air, at this\ntime of year, and in such weather, for a week, at the very shortest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor boy! Why should he overwork himself? Then you think that three\ndays\u00e2\u0080\u0099 change is scarcely enough to set him up again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe wants at least a fortnight, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am. He has a sort of a hacking\ncough, which he does his best to keep under. And the doctors say\nthat the smell of ink out of a pewter inkstand, and the inhaling of\nblotting-paper--such as we inhale all day--are almost certain, in hot\nweather, to root a tussis, or at any rate a pituita, inwards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Lovejoy was much impressed; and tenfold so when she tried to think\nwhat those maladies might be.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is dreadful to think of. I know too well what\nthose sad complaints are. My dear grandfather died of them both. Do you\nthink now, Mr. Lorraine, that Mr. Malahide could be persuaded to spare\nyou both for the rest of the week?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI scarcely think that he could, Mrs. Lovejoy. We are his right hand,\nand his left. Your son, of course, his dexter hand; and my poor self\nthe weaker member. Still, if you were to write to him, nicely (as of\ncourse you would be sure to write), he might make an effort to get on,\nwith some of his inferior pupils.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shall be done, before the van goes--by the very next mail, I mean.\nAnd if they can spare you, do you think that you could put up with your\nvery poor quarters, for a few days longer, Mr. Lorraine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never was in such quarters before. And I never felt so comfortable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe answered, with a gush of truth, to expiate much small hypocrisy. And\nthereby he settled himself for ever in her very best graces. If Mrs.\nLovejoy had any pride--and she always told herself she had none--that\npride lay in her best feather-beds.\n\nA smile quite worthy of her larger husband, and of her pleasant\nhomestead, spread itself over her thoughtful face; and Hilary, for the\nfirst time, saw that her daughter, after all, was born of her. What can\nbe sweeter than a smile, won from a sensible woman like that?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you give us some hope that we may endeavour to keep you a few\ndays more, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe endeavour will be on my part,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered with his most elegant\nbow; \u00e2\u0080\u009cas all the temptation falls on me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do hope that Mr. Malahide will do his best to spare you both. Though\nto lose both his right hand and his left hand must be very melancholy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo a lawyer, Mrs. Lovejoy, that is nothing. We think nothing of such\ntrifles. We are ready to fight when we have no hands, nor even a leg to\nstand upon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, to be sure, you live by fighting, as the poor sailors and\nsoldiers do. The general of the attorneys now is my first cousin, once\nremoved. Now can you tell me what opinion he has formed of my Gregory?\nOf course there must be a number of people trying to keep my poor\nboy back. Pressing him down, as they always do, with all that narrow\njealousy. But his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cousin might be trusted to give him fair\nplay, now, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne never can tell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe faster a young fellow goes\nup the tree, the harder the monkeys pelt him. But if I only had a\nquarter of your son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability, I would defy them all at once, from the\nLord Chief-Justice downward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, now, Mr. Lorraine; that really would be bad advice. He has not\nbeen called to the Bar as yet; and he must remember that there are\npeople many years in front of him. No, no; let Gregory wait for his\nproper time in its proper course, and steadily rise to the top of the\ntree. With patience, Mr. Lorraine, you know, with patience all things\ncome to pass. But I must go to the house at once, and write to Mr.\nMalahide. Do you think that he would be offended, if I asked him to\naccept a basket of our choicest cherries and strawberries?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI scarcely think that he would regard it as a mortal injury;\nespecially if you were to put it as a tribute from his grateful pupil,\nHilary Lorraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow kind of you to let me use your name! And you have such influence\nwith him, Gregory is always telling me. No doubt he will accept them\nso.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever, when she came to consider the matter, Mrs. Lovejoy, with\nshameful treachery, sent them as a little offering from that grateful\npupil her own son: while she laid upon Hilary all the burden of this\nlengthened mitching-time; as in the main perhaps was just. Moreover,\nshe took good care that Shorne should have no chance of appearing in\nchambers, as he was only too eager to do; for her shrewd sense told\nher that the sharp wits there would find him a joy for ever, and an\nenduring joke against Gregory.\n\nIt is scarcely needful to say, perhaps, that throughout the rest of the\nweek, Lorraine did his utmost to bring about snug little interviews\nwith Mabel. And she, having made up her mind to keep him henceforth at\nhis distance, felt herself bound by that resolution to afford him a\nglimpse or two, once in a way. For she really had a great deal to do;\nand it would have been cruel to deny her even the right to talk of it.\nAnd Hilary carried a basket so much better than anybody else, and his\ntouch was so light, and he stepped here and there so obediently and so\ncleverly, and he always looked away so nicely, if any briery troubles\nbefell--as now and then of course must be--that Mabel began every day\nto think how dreadfully she would miss him.\n\nAnd then, as if it were not enough to please her ears, and eyes, and\nmind, he even contrived to conciliate the most grateful part of the\nhuman system, as well as the most intelligent. For on the Tuesday\nafternoon, the turn of the work, and the courses of fruit, led them\nnear a bushy corner, where the crafty brook stole through. As clever\nand snug a dingle as need be, for a pair of young people to drop\naccidentally out of sight and ear-shot. For here, the corner of the\norchard fell away, as a quarry does, yet was banked with grass, and\nridges, so that children might take hands and run. But if they did so,\nthey would be certain to come to grief at the bottom, unless they could\nclear at a jump three yards, which would puzzle most of them. For here\nthe brook, without any noise, came under a bank of good brown loam,\nwith a gentle shallow slide, and a bottom content to be run over.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrout, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a living sinner!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary with a fierce delight,\nas he fetched up suddenly on the brink, and a dozen streaks darted up\nthe stream, like the throw of a threaded shuttle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy prophetic soul,\nif I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guess it! But I seem to forget almost everything. Why Miss\nLovejoy, Miss Mabel Lovejoy, Mabel Miss Lovejoy (or any other form,\ninsisting on the prefix despotically), have I known you for a century\nor more, and you never told me there were trout in the brook!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, do let me see them; please to show me where,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mabel, coming\ncarefully down the steep, lest her slender feet should slip: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are\nsuch dears, I do assure you. My mother and I are so fond of them. But\nmy father says they are all bones and tail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will show them to you with the greatest pleasure, only you must do\njust what I order you. They are very shy things, you know, almost as\nshy as somebody----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMabel, Mabel, Mab, where are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d came a loud shout over the crest;\nand then Gregory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s square shoulders appeared--a most unwelcome\nspectacle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, here I am to be sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere else do you suppose I\nshould be? The people must be looked after, I suppose. And if you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ndo it, of course I must.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any people to look after here, except indeed--however, you\nseem to have looked so hard, it has made you quite red in the face, I\ndeclare!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow Greg, my boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary, suddenly coming to the rescue; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncalled your sister down here on purpose to tell me what those things\nin the water are. They look almost like some sort of fish!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy trout, Lorraine! Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know that? I thought that you were a\ngreat fisherman. If you like to have a try at them I can fit you out.\nThough I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suppose you could do much in this weather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Lovejoy, did you ever taste a trout?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hilary asked this question,\nas if not a word had yet passed on the subject.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mabel, no less oblivious; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy brother Charles used\nto catch a good many. They are such a treat to my dear mother, and so\ngood for her constitution. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think my father appreciates\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAllow me to help you up this steep rise. It was most inconsiderate of\nme to call you down, Miss Lovejoy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPray do not mention it, Mr. Lorraine. Gregory, how rude you are to\ngive Mr. Lorraine all this trouble! But you never were famous for good\nmanners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I meddle with them again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Gregory, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay I be \u00e2\u0080\u0098adorned,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nas my father says! However, I must keep a sharp look-out. The girl is\ngetting quite independent; and I,--oh, I am to be nobody! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just go\nand see what Phyllis thinks of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Mabel, who had not forgiven him yet for his insolent remark about\nher cheeks, deprived him of even that comfort.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow Gregory dear, you have done nothing all day but wander about with\ncousin Phyllis. Just stay here for a couple of hours; if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work\nyourself, your looking on will make the other people work. I am quite\nashamed of my inattention to Mr. Lorraine all the afternoon. I am sure\nhe must want a glass of ale, after all he has gone through. And while\nhe takes it, I may be finding Charlie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tackle for him. I know where it\nis, and you do not. And Charlie left it especially under my charge, you\nremember.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the first I have heard of it. However, if Lorraine wants beer,\nwhy so do I. Send Phyllis out with a jug for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, to be sure, dear. To be sure. How delighted she will be to come!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs delighted as you are to go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied; but she was already out\nof hearing; and all he took for his answer was an indignant look from\nHilary.\n\nAn excellent and most patient fisherman used to say that the greatest\npleasure of the gentle art was found in the preparation to fish. In the\nmaking of flies, and the knotting of gut, and the softening of collars\nthat have caught fish, and the choosing of what to try this time, and\nhow to treat the river. The treasures of memory glow again, and the\nsparkling stores of hope awake to a lively emulation.\n\nHilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind had securely landed every fish in the brook at least, and\nlaid it at the feet of Mabel, ere ever his tackle was put to rights,\nand everything else made ready. At last he was at the very point of\nstarting, with his ever high spirits at their highest pitch, when Mabel\n(scarcely a whit behind him in the excitement of this great matter) ran\nin for the fiftieth time at least, but this time wearing her evening\nfrock. That frock was of a delicate buff, and she had a suspicion that\nit enhanced the clearness of her complexion, and the kind and deep\nloveliness of her eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must be quite tired of seeing me, I am as sure as sure can be.\nBut I am not come now to tie knots, or untie: and you quite understand\nall I know about trout, and all that my dear brother Charlie said. Ah,\nMr. Lorraine, you should see him. Gregory is a genius, of course. But\nCharlie is not; and that makes him so nice. And his uniform, when he\nwent to church with us--but to understand such things, you must see\nthem. Still, you can understand this now, perhaps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can understand nothing, when I look at you. My intellect seems to be\nquite absorbed in--in--I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you in what.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen go, and absorb it in catching trout. Though I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe you\nwill ever catch one. It requires the greatest skill and patience, when\nthe water is bright, and the weather dry. So Charlie always said,\nwhen he could not catch them. Unless you take to a worm, at least, or\nsomething a great deal nastier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA worm! I would sooner lime them almost. Now you know me better than\nthat, I am sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow should I know all the different degrees of cruelty men have\nestablished? But I came to beg you just to take a little bit of food\nwith you. Because you must be away some hours, and you are sure to lose\nyour way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow wonderfully kind you are, Mabel!--you must be Mabel now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I suppose I have been Mabel ever since they christened me. But\nthat has nothing at all to do with it. Only I came to make you put this\nhalf of cold duck into your basket, and this pinch of salt, and the\nbarley-cake, and a drop of our ale in this stone bottle. To drink it,\nyou must do like this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know what I shall be wanting, every bit of the time, and for\never?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, the mustard--how stupid of me! But I hoped that the stuffing would\ndo instead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead of the cold half duck, I shall want every atom of the whole\nduck, warm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, there they are, Mr. Lorraine, in the yard. Fourteen of them now\ncoming up from the pond. Take one of them, if you can eat it raw. But\nmy mother will make you pay for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will pay for my duck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, lifting his hat; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it costs me\nevery farthing I have, or shall ever have, in this world, or another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd so he went fishing; and she ran upstairs, and softly cried, as she\nwatched him going; and then lay down, with her hand on her heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE KEY OF THE GATE.\n\n\nThe trout knew nothing of all this. They had not tasted a worm for a\nmonth, except when a sod of the bank fell in, through cracks of the\nsun, and the way cold water has of licking upward. And even the flies\nhad no flavour at all; when they fell on the water, they fell flat, and\non the palate they tasted hot, even in under the bushes.\n\nHilary followed a path through the meadows, with the calm bright sunset\ncasting his shadow over the shorn grass, or up in the hedgerow, or on\nthe brown banks where the drought had struck. On his back he carried a\nfishing-basket, containing his bits of refreshment; and in his right\nhand a short springy rod, the absent sailor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favourite. After long\ncouncil with Mabel, he had made up his mind to walk up stream, as far\nas the spot where two brooks met, and formed body enough for a fly\nflipped in very carefully to sail downward. Here he began, and the\ncreak of his reel, and the swish of his rod, were music to him, after\nthe whirl of London life.\n\nThe brook was as bright as the best cut glass, and the twinkles of\nits shifting facets only made it seem more clear. It twisted about\na little, here and there; and the brink was fringed now and then\nwith something, a clump of loosestrife, a tuft of avens, or a bed of\nflowering water-cress, or any other of the many plants that wash and\nlook into the water. But the trout, the main object in view, were\nmost objectionably too much in view. They scudded up the brook, at\nthe shadow of a hair, or even the tremble of a blade of grass; and no\npacific assurance could make them even stop to be reasoned with. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, who very often talked to himself, in lack of a\nbetter comrade: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI call this very hard upon me. The beggars won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rise,\ntill it is quite dark. I must have the interdict off my tobacco, if\nthis sort of thing is to go on. How I should enjoy a pipe just now! I\nmay just as well sit on a gate and think. No, hang it, I hate thinking\nnow. There are troubles hanging over me, as sure as the tail of that\ncomet grows. How I detest that comet! No wonder the fish won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rise.\nBut if I have to strip, and tickle them in the dark, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go back\nwithout some for her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was lucky enough to escape the weight of such horrible poaching upon\nhis conscience. For suddenly to his ears was borne the most melodious\nof all sounds, the flop of a heavy fish sweetly jumping after some\nexcellent fly or grub.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa, my friend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cso you are up for your supper, are you?\nI myself will awake right early. Still I behold the ring you made. If\nmy right hand forget not his cunning, you shall form your next ring in\nthe frying-pan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe gave that fish a little time to think of the beauty of that\nmouthful, and get ready for another; the while he was putting a white\nmoth on, in lieu of his blue-upright. He kept the grizzled palmer still\nfor tail-fly, and he tried his knots, for he knew that this trout was a\nTriton.\n\nThen, with a delicate sidling and stooping, known only to them that\nfish for trout in very bright water of the summer-time--compared\nwith which art, the coarse work of the salmon-fisher is as that of\na scene-painter to Mr. Holman Hunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s--with, or in, and by a careful\nmanner, not to be described to those who have never studied it, Hilary\nwon access of the water, without any doubt in the mind of the fish\nconcerning the prudence of appetite. Then he flipped his short collar\nin, not with a cast, but a spring of the rod, and let his flies go\nquietly down a sharpish run into that good trout\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hover. The worthy\ntrout looked at them both, and thought; for he had his own favourite\nspot for watching the world go by, as the rest of us have. So he let\nthe grizzled palmer pass, within an inch of his upper lip; for it\nstruck him that the tail turned up in a manner not wholly natural, or\nat any rate unwholesome. He looked at the white moth also, and thought\nthat he had never seen one at all like it. So he drew back under his\nroot again, hugging himself upon his wisdom, never moving a fin, but\noaring and helming his plump spotted sides with his tail.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my word, it is too bad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, after three beautiful\nthrows, and exquisite management down stream; \u00e2\u0080\u009ceverything Kentish beats\nme hollow. Now, if that had been one of our trout, I would have laid my\nlife upon catching him. One more throw, however. How would it be if I\nsunk my flies? That fellow is worth some patience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile he was speaking, his flies alit on the glassy ripple, like gnats\nin their love-dance; and then by a turn of the wrist he played them\njust below the surface, and let them go gliding down the stickle, into\nthe shelfy nook of shadow, where the big trout hovered. Under the\nsurface, floating thus, with the check of ductile influence, the two\nflies spread their wings, and quivered, like a centiplume moth in a\nspider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s web. Still the old trout, calmly oaring, looked at them both\nsuspiciously. Why should the same flies come so often, and why should\nthey have such crooked tails, and could he be sure that he did not spy\nthe shadow of a human hat about twelve yards up the water? Revolving\nthese things he might have lived to a venerable age--but for that noble\nambition to teach, which is fatal to even the wisest. A young fish,\nan insolent whipper-snapper jumped in his babyish way at the palmer,\nand missed it through over-eagerness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you the way to catch a\nfly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the big trout to him: \u00e2\u0080\u009copen your mouth like this, my son.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith that he bolted the palmer, and threw up his tail, and turned to\ngo home again. Alas! his sweet home now shall know him no more. For\nsuddenly he was surprised by a most disagreeable sense of grittiness,\nand then a keen stab in the roof of his mouth. He jumped in his wrath\na foot out of the water, and then heavily plunged to the depths of his\nhole.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got it, my friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary, in a tingle of fine emotions;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope the sailor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knots are tied with professional skill and care.\nYou are a big one, and a clever one too. It is much if I ever land you.\nNo net, or gaff, or anything. I only hope there are no stakes here. Ah,\nthere you go! Now comes the tug.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAway went the big trout down the stream, at a pace very hard to\nexaggerate, and after him rushed Hilary, knowing that his line was\nrather short, and if it ran out, all was over. Keeping his eyes on\nthe water only, and the headlong speed of the fugitive, headlong over\na stake he fell, and took a deep wound from another stake. Scarcely\nfeeling it, up he jumped, lifting his rod, which had fallen flat, and\nfearing to find no strain on it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAha! he is not gone yet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried as\nthe rod bowed like a springle-bow.\n\nHe was now a good hundred yards down the brook, from the corner where\nthe fight began. Through his swiftness of foot, and good management,\nthe fish had never been able to tighten the line beyond yield of\nendurance. The bank had been free from bushes, or haply no skill could\nhave saved him; but now they were come to a corner where a nutbush\nquite overhung the stream.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am done for now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the fisherman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe villain knows too well\nwhat he is about. Here ends this adventure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFull though he was of despair, he jumped anyhow into the water, lowered\nthe point of his rod to pass, reeled up a little (as the fish felt\nweaker), and just cleared the drop of the hazel-boughs. The water\nflapped into the pockets of his coat, and he saw red streaks flow\ndownward. And then he plunged out to an open reach of shallow water and\ngravel slope.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought to have you now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough nobody knows what a rogue\nyou are; and a pretty dance you have led me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDoubting the strength of his tackle to lift even the dead weight of\nthe fish, and much more to meet his despairing rally, he happily saw a\nlittle shallow gut, or backwater, where a small spring ran out. Into\nthis, by a dexterous turn, he rather led than pulled the fish, who was\nready to rest for a minute or two; then he stuck his rod into the bank,\nran down stream, and with his hat in both hands appeared at the only\nexit from the gut. It was all up now with the monarch of the brook. As\nhe skipped and jumped, with his rich yellow belly, and chaste silver\nsides, in the green of the grass, joy and glory of the highest merit,\nand gratitude, glowed in the heart of Lorraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo and three quarters\nyou must weigh. And at your very best you are! How small your head is!\nAnd how bright your spots are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, as he gave him the stroke of\ngrace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou really have been a brave and fine fellow. I hope they will\nknow how to fry you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile he cut his fly out of this grand trout\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth, he felt for the\nfirst time a pain in his knee, where the point of the stake had entered\nit. Under the buckle of his breeches, blood was soaking away inside his\ngaiters; and then he saw how he had dyed the water. After washing the\nwound, and binding it with dock-leaves and a handkerchief, he followed\nthe stream through a few more meadows, for the fish began to sport\npretty well as the gloom of the evening deepened; so that by the time\nthe gables of the old farm-house appeared (by the light of a young\nmoon and the comet), Lorraine had a dozen more trout in his basket,\nsilvery-sided and handsome fellows, though none of them over a pound,\nperhaps, except his first and redoubtable captive.\n\nHerewith he resolved to be content; for his knee was now very sore and\nstiff, and the growing darkness baffled him; while having forgotten his\nfood, as behoved him, he was conscious of an agreeable fitness for the\nsupper-table. Here, of course, he had to tell, at least thrice over,\nhis fight with the Triton; who turned the scale at three pounds and a\nquarter, and was recognized as an old friend and twice conqueror of the\nabsent Charlie. Mrs. Lovejoy (as was to be expected) made a great ado\nabout the gash in the knee--which really was no trifle--while Mabel\nsaid nothing, but blamed herself deeply for having equipped him to such\nmisfortune.\n\nFor the next few days, Master Hilary was compelled to keep his active\nframe in rest, and quiet, and cosseting. Even the Grower, a man of\nstrong manhood, accustomed to scythe-cuts, and chopper-hits, and\npole-springs, admitted that this was a case for broth, and low feeding,\nand things that the women do. For if inflammation set up, the boy\nmight have only one leg left for life. It was high time, however, for\nthe son of the house to return to his beloved law-books; so that he\ntore himself away from Phyllis, and started in the van, about noon\non Friday, having promised to send back by John Shorne all that his\nfellow-pupil wanted.\n\nLorraine soon found that his kind and quick hostess loved few things\nbetter than a cheerful, dutiful, and wholesome-blooded patient; and\ntherefore he rejected with scorn all suggestions as to his need of a\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cproper doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And herein the Grower backed him up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAdorn me, if any one of them ever lays finger on me, any more than on\nmy good father before me! They handle us when we are born, of course,\nand come to no manner of judgment: but if we let them handle us\nafterwards, we deserve to go out of the world before them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis sound discretion (combined with the plentiful use of cold water\nand healing herbs) set Hilary on his legs again, in about eight or\nten days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time. Meanwhile, he had seen very little of Mabel, whether\nthrough her fault or that of others he could not tell--only so it\nwas. Whenever his hostess was out of the way, Phyllis Catherow, and\nthe housemaid, did their best to supply her place; and very often the\nGrower dropped in, to enjoy his pipe, and to cheer his guest. By means\nof simple truth, they showed him that he was no burden to them, even at\nthis busy time.\n\nAfter all this, it was only natural that Hilary should become\nmuch attached, as well as grateful, to his entertainers. Common\nformality was dropped, and caste entirely sunk in hearty liking and\nloving-kindness. And young Lorraine was delighted to find how many\npleasant virtues flourished under the thatch of that old house,\nuncoveted and undisturbed; inasmuch as their absence was not felt in\nthe mansions of great people.\n\nThis affection for virtue doubtless made him feel sadly depressed and\nlonely, when the time at length arrived for quitting so much excellence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the van he came, and in the van he would go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied to all\nremonstrance; and the Grower liked him all the better for his loyalty\nto the fruit-coach. So it was settled when Crusty John was \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoing up\nlight\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a Thursday morning, that Hilary should have a mattress laid\nin the body of the vehicle, and a horse-cloth to throw over him, if the\nnight should prove a cold one. For now a good drop of rain had fallen,\nand the weather seemed on the change awhile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must catch you another dish of trout,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary to Mrs. Lovejoy;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen shall I have such a chance again? The brook is in beautiful order\nnow; and thanks to your wonderful skill and kindness, I can walk again\nquite grandly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, for a little way you can. But you must be sure not to overdo it.\nYou may fish one meadow, and one only. Let me see. You may fish the\nlong meadow, Hilary; then you will have neither stile nor hedge. The\ngate at this end unlatches, mind. And I will send Phyllis to let you\nout at the lower end, and to see that you dare not go one step further.\nShe shall be there at half-past six. The van goes at eight, you know,\nand we must sit down to supper at seven exactly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUpon this understanding he set forth, about five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the\nafternoon, and meeting Miss Catherow in the lane, he begged her, as an\nespecial favour, to keep out of Mrs. Lovejoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way for the next two\nhours only. Phyllis, a good-natured girl on the whole (though a little\ntoo proud of her beauty perhaps), readily promised what he asked,\nand retired to a seat in the little ash coppice, to read a poem, and\nmeditate upon the absent Gregory.\n\nLorraine was certainly in luck to-day, for he caught a nice basket of\nfish down the meadow; and towards the last stickle near the corner,\nwhere silver threads of water crossed, and the slanting sunshine cast\na plaid of softest gold upon them, light footsteps came by the side of\nthe hedge, and a pretty shadow fell near him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Lovejoy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow you amaze me! Why, I thought it was\nPhyllis who was coming to fetch me. I may call her Phyllis,--oh yes,\nshe allows me. She is not so very ceremonious. But some people are all\ndignity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you want to vex me the very last thing. And they call you so\nsweet-tempered! I am so sorry for your disappointment about your dear\nfriend Phyllis. But I am sure I looked for her everywhere, before I was\nobliged to come myself. Now I hope you have not found the poor little\ntrout quite so hard to please as you are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt any rate, not so shy of me, as somebody has been for a fortnight.\nBecause I was in trouble, I suppose, and pain, and supposed to be\ngroaning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can you say such bitter things? It shows how very little you\ncare--at least, that is not what I mean at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, if you please, what is it that you do mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean that here is the key of the gate. And my father will expect you\nat seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut surely you will have a look at my trout? They cannot bite, if I\ncan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe laid his fishing-creel down on the grass, and Mabel stooped over it\nto hide her eyes; which (in spite of all pride and prudence) were not\nexactly as she could have wished. But they happened to be exactly as\nHilary wished, and catching a glimpse of them unawares, he lost all\nideas except of them; and basely compelled them to look at him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Mabel Lovejoy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, slowly, and with some dread of his\nown voice; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan you look me in the face, and tell me you do not care\ntwopence for me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not in the habit of being rude,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, with a sly glance\nfrom under her hat; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I leave for other people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, do you like me, or do you not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do ask the most extraordinary questions. We are bound to like our\nvisitors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will ask a still more extraordinary question. Do you love me, Mabel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor a very long time he got no answer, except a little smothered sob,\nand two great tears that would have their way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDarling Mabel, look\nup and tell me. Why should you be ashamed to say? I am very proud of\nloving you. Lovely Mabel, do you love me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--I--I am--very--much afraid--I almost do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shrank away from his arms and eyes, and longed to be left to\nherself for a little. And then she thought what a mean thing it was\nto be taking advantage of his bad leg. With that she came back, and to\nchange his thoughts, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShow me a trout in the brook now, Hilary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou deserve to see fifty, for being so good. There, you must help me\nalong, you know. Now just stand here and let me hold you, carefully and\nmost steadily. No, not like that. That will never do. I must at least\nhave one arm round you, or in you go, and I have to answer for your\nbeing \u00e2\u0080\u0098drownded\u00e2\u0080\u0099!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDrowned! You take advantage now to make me so ridiculous. The water is\nscarcely six inches deep. But where are the little troutsies?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere! There! Do you see that white stone? Now look at it most\nsteadfastly, and then you are sure not to see them. Now turn your head\nlike that, a little,--not too much, whatever you do. Now what do you\nsee, most clearly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I see nothing but you and me, in the shadow of that oak-tree,\nstanding over the water as if we had nothing better in the world to do!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are standing together, though. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, even the water seems to think so. And what can be more\nchangeable?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow look at me, and not at the water. Mabel, you know what I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHilary, I wish I did. That is the very thing that takes such a long\ntime to find out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, did I treat you in such a spirit? Did I look at you, and\nthink,\u00e2\u0080\u0098here is a rogue I must find out\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, of course you never did. That is not in your nature. At the same\ntime, perhaps, it might not matter so long to you, as it must to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe met his glad eyes with a look so wistful, yet of such innocent\ntrust (to assuage the harm of words), that Hilary might be well excused\nfor keeping the Grower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supper waiting, as he did that evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nFOUR YOUNG LADIES.\n\n\nThe excellent people of Coombe Lorraine as yet were in happy ignorance\nof all these fine doings on Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part. Sir Roland knew only too\nwell, of course, that his son and heir was of a highly romantic,\nchivalrous, and adventurous turn. At Eton and Oxford many little\nscrapes (which seemed terrible at the time) showed that he was sure to\ndo his best to get into grand scrapes, as the landscape of his youthful\nworld enlarged.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHappen what will, I can always trust my boy to be a gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his\nfather used to say to himself, and to his only real counsellor, old Sir\nRemnant Chapman. Sir Remnant always shook his head; and then (for fear\nof having meant too much) said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, that is the one thing after all.\nPeople begin to talk a great deal too much about Christianity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt any rate, the last thing they thought of was the most likely thing\nof all--that Hilary should fall in love with a good, and sweet, and\nsimple girl, who, for his own sake, would love him, and grow to him\nwith all the growth of love. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMorality\u00e2\u0080\u009d--whereby we mean now, truth,\nand right, and purity--was then despised in public, even more than now\nin private life. Sir Remnant thought it a question of shillings, how\nmany maids his son led astray; and he pitied Sir Roland for having a\nson so much handsomer than his own.\n\nLittle as now he meddled with it, Sir Roland knew that the world was\nso; and the more he saw of it, the less he found such things go down\nwell with him. The broad low stories, and practical jokes, and babyish\nfinesse of oaths, invented for the ladies--many of which still survive\nin the hypocrisy of our good tongue--these had a great deal to do\nwith Sir Roland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love of his own quiet dinner-table, and shelter of\nhis pet child, Alice. And nothing, perhaps, except old custom and the\ntraditions of friendship, could have induced him to bear, as he did,\nwith Sir Remnant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far lower standard. Let a man be what he will, he\nmust be moved one way or another by the folk he deals with. Even Sir\nRoland (though so different from the people around him) felt their\nthoughts around him rambling, and very often touching him: and he never\ncould altogether help wanting to know what they thought about him. So\nmust the greatest man ever \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeveloped\u00e2\u0080\u009d have desired a million-fold,\nbecause he lived in each one of the million.\n\nHowever, there were but two to whom Sir Roland Lorraine ever yielded a\npeep of his deeply treasured anxieties. One was Sir Remnant; and the\nother (in virtue of his office, and against the grain) was the Rev.\nStruan Hales, his own highly respected brother-in-law.\n\nStruan Hales was a man of mark all about that neighbourhood. Everybody\nknew him; and almost everybody liked him. Because he was a genial,\nopen-hearted, and sometimes noisy man; full of life--in his own form\nof that matter--and full of the love of life, whenever he found other\npeople lively. He hated every kind of humbug, all revolutionary ideas,\nmethodism, asceticism, enthusiastic humanity, and exceedingly fine\nlanguage. And though, like everyone else, he respected Sir Roland\nLorraine for his upright character, lofty honour, and clearness of\nmind; while he liked him for his generosity, kindness of heart, and\ngentleness; on the other hand he despised him a little, for his shyness\nand quietude of life. For the rector of West Lorraine loved nothing\nbetter than a good day with the hounds, and a roaring dinner-party\nafterwards. Nothing in the way of sport ever came amiss to him; even\nthough it did--as no true sport does--depend for its joy upon cruelty.\n\nHere, in his red house on the glebe, under the battlement of the hills,\nwith trees and a garden of comfort, and snug places to smoke a pipe in,\nMr. Hales was well content to live and do his duty. He liked to hunt\ntwice in a week, and he liked to preach twice every Sunday. Still he\ncould not do either always; and no good people blamed him.\n\nMrs. Hales was the sweetest creature ever seen, almost anywhere. She\nhad plenty to say for herself, and a great deal more to say for others;\nand if perfection were to be found, she would have been perfection to\nevery mind except her own, and perhaps her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. The rector used\nto say that his wife was an angel, if ever one there were: and in his\nheart he felt that truth. Still he did not speak to her always, as if\nhe were fully aware of being in colloquy with an angel. He had lived\nwith her \u00e2\u0080\u009cever so long,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he knew that she was a great deal better\nthan himself; but he had the wisdom not to let her know it; and she\noften thought that he preached at her. Such a thing he never did.\nNo honest parson would ever do it; of all mean acts it would be the\nmeanest. Yet there are very few parsons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wives who are not prepared for\nthe chance of it; and Mrs. Hales knew that she \u00e2\u0080\u009chad her faults,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nthat Mr. Hales was quite up to them. At any rate, here these good folk\nwere, and here they meant to live their lives out, having a pretty old\nplace to see to, and kind old neighbours to see to them. Also they had\na much better thing--three good children of their own; enough to make\nwork and pleasure for them, but not to be a perpetual worry, inasmuch\nas they all were girls--three very good girls, of their sort--thinking\nas they were told to think, and sure to make excellent women.\n\nAlice Lorraine liked all these girls. They were so kind, and sweet,\nand simple; and when they had nothing whatever to say, they always\nsaid it so prettily. And they never pretended to interfere with any of\nher opinions, or to come into competition with her, or to talk to her\nfather, when she was present, more than she well could put up with.\nFor she was a very jealous child; and they were well aware of it; and\nthey might let their father be her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother ten times over,\nbefore she would hear of any \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalesy element\u00e2\u0080\u009d--as she once had called\nit--coming into her family more than it had already entered: and they\nknew right well, while they thought it too bad, that this young Alice\nhad sadly quenched any hopes any one of them might have cherished of\nbeing a Lady Lorraine some day. She had made her poor brother laugh\nover their tricks, when they were sure that they had no tricks; and she\nalways seemed to throw such a light upon any little harmless thing\nthey did. Still they could afford to forget all that; and they did\nforget it; especially now, when Hilary would soon be at home again.\n\nIt was now July; and no one had heard for weeks from that same Hilary.\nBut this made no one anxious, because it was the well-known manner of\nthe youth. Sometimes they would hear from him by every post, although\nthe post now came thrice in a week; and then again for weeks together,\nnot a line would he vouchsafe. And as a general rule he was getting on\nbetter, when he kept strict silence.\n\nTherefore Alice had no load on her mind, at all worth speaking of,\nwhile she worked in her sloping flower-garden, early of a summer\nafternoon. It was now getting on for St. Swithin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day; and the sun was\nbeginning to curtail those brief attentions which he paid to Coombe\nLorraine. He still looked fairly at it, as often as clouds allowed in\nthe morning, almost up to eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock; and after that he could still\nsee down it over the shoulder of the hill. But he felt that his rays\nmade no impression (the land so fell away from him), they seemed to do\nnothing but dance away downward, like a lasher of glittering water.\n\nTherefore, in this garden grew soft and gentle-natured plants, and\nflowers of delicate tint, that sink in the exhaustion of the sunglare.\nThe sun, in almost every garden, sucks the beauty out of all the\nflowers; he stains the sweet violet even in March; he spots the\nprimrose and the periwinkle; he takes the down off the heartsease\nblossom; he browns the pure lily-of-the-valley in May; and, after that,\nhe dims the tint of every rose that he opens: and yet, in spite of all\nhis mischief, which of them does not rejoice in him?\n\nThe bold chase, cut in the body of the hill, has rugged sides, and\na steep descent for a quarter of a mile below the house--the cleft\nof the chalk on either side growing deeper towards the mouth of the\ncoombe. The main road to the house goes up the coombe, passing under\nthe eastern scarp, but winding away from it, here and there, to obtain\na better footing. The old house, facing down the hill, stands so close\nto the head of the coombe, that there is not more than an acre or so\nof land behind and between it and the crest; and this is partly laid\nout as a courtyard, partly occupied by out-buildings, stables, and so\non, and the ruinous keep ingloriously used as a lime-kiln; while the\nrest of the space is planted, in and out, with spruce and birch-trees,\nand anything that will grow there. Among them winds a narrow outlet to\nthe upper and open Downs--not much of a road for carriage-wheels, but\nsomething in appearance betwixt a bridle-path and a timber-track, such\nas is known in those parts by the old English name, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cborstall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs this led to no dwelling-house for miles and miles away, but only\nto the crown of the hills and the desolate tract of sheep-walks,\nninety-nine visitors out of a hundred to the house came up the coombe,\nso that Alice from her flower-garden, commanding the course of the\ndrive from the plains, could nearly always foresee the approach of any\ninterruption. Here she had pretty seats under laburnums, and even a\nbower of jessamine, and a noble view all across the weald, even to the\nrange of the North Downs; so that it was a pleasant place for all who\nlove soft sward and silence, and have time to enjoy that rare romance\nof the seasons--a hot English summer.\n\nOnly there was one sad drawback. Lady Valeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s windows straightly\noverlooked this pleasant spot, and Lady Valeria never could see why she\nshould not overlook everything. Beyond and above all other things, she\ntook it as her own special duty to watch her dear granddaughter Alice;\nand now in her eighty-second year she was proud of her eyesight, and\nliked to prove its power.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere they come again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice, talking to herself, or her rake,\nand trowel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill they never be content? I told them on Monday that I\nknew nothing; and they will not believe it. I have a great mind to hide\nmyself in my hole, like that poor rag-and-bone boy. It goes beyond my\npatience quite, to be cross-examined and not believed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThose whom she saw coming up the steep road at struggling and panting\nintervals, were her three good cousins from the rectory--Caroline,\nMargaret, and Cecil Hales; rather nice-looking and active girls,\nresembling their father in face and frame, and their excellent mother\nin their spiritual parts. The Anglican period of young ladies--the time\nof wearing great crosses, and starving, and sticking as a thorn in the\nflesh of mankind, lay as yet in the happy future. A parson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughters\nwere as yet content to leave the parish to their father, helping him\nonly in the Sunday-school; and for the rest of the week, minding their\nown dresses, or some delicate jobs of pastry, or gossip.\n\nThough Alice had talked so of running away, she knew quite well that\nshe never could do it, unless it were for a childish joke; and swiftly\nshe was leaving now the pretty and petty world of childhood, sinking\ninto that distance whence the failing years recover it. Therefore,\ninstead of running away, she ran down the hill to meet her cousins; for\ntruly she liked them decently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you dear, how are you? How wonderfully good to come to meet\nus! Madge, I shall be jealous in a moment if you kiss my Alice so.\nCecil--what are you thinking of? Why, you never kissed your cousin\nAlice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes, you have all done it very nicely. What more could I wish?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut what could have made you come up the hill, so early in\nthe day, dears?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you know what dear mamma is. She really fancied that we might\nseem (now there is so much going on) really unkind and heartless,\nunless we came up to see how you were. Papa would have come; but he\nfeels it so steep, unless he is coming up to dinner; and pony, you\nknow--Oh, she did such a thing! The wicked little dear, she got into\nthe garden, and devoured \u00c2\u00a310 worth of the grand new flower, just\nintroduced by the Duchess--\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dallia,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dellia,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spell the\nname. And mamma was so upset that both of them have been unwell ever\nsince.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Dahlias!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Alice, whose grapes were rather sour, because\nher father had refused to buy any; \u00e2\u0080\u009cflaunty things in my opinion. But\nCaroline, Madge, and Cecil, have you ever set eyes on my new rose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOf course they all ran to behold the new rose; which was no other\nthan the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPersian yellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a beautiful stranger, not yet at home. The\ncountless petals of brilliant yellow folding inward full of light, and\nthe dimple in the centre, shy of yielding inlet to its virgin gold, and\nthen the delicious fragrance, too refined for random sniffers,--these\nand other delights found entry into the careless beholder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt makes one think of astrologers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Caroline Hales; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI declare\nit does! Look at all the little stars! It is quite like a celestial\nglobe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo it is, I do declare!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Madge. But Cecil shook her head. She\nwas the youngest, and much the prettiest, and by many degrees the most\nelegant of the daughters of the rectory. Cecil had her own opinion\nabout many things; but waited till it should be valuable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is much more like a cowslip-ball,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alice answered, carelessly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome into my bower now. And then we can all of us go to sleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe three girls were a little hot and thirsty, after their climb of the\nchalky road; and a bright spring ran through the bower, as they knew,\nready to harmonize with sherbet, sherry-wine, or even shrub itself; as\nhad once been proved by Hilary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow delicious this is! How truly sweet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the eldest, and perhaps\nmost loquacious, Miss Hales; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand how nice of you always to keep a\nglass! A spring is such a rarity on these hills; papa says it comes\nfrom a different stratum. What a stratum is I have no idea. It ought\nto be straight, one may safely say that; but it always seems to be\ncrooked. Now, can you explain that, darling Alice? You are so highly\ntaught, and so clever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want a lecture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Madge, the blunt one; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe hill is\ntoo steep to have that at the top. Alice knows everything, no doubt, in\nthe way of science, and all that. But what we are dying to know is what\ncame of that grand old astrologer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the seventh or eighth time now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alice answered, hard at bay,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you will keep on about some little thing that the servants are\nmaking mountains of. My father best knows what it is. Let us go to his\nroom and ask him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, dear! oh no, dear? How could we do that? What would dear uncle\nsay to us? But come, now tell us. You do know something. Why are you so\nmysterious? Mystery is a thing altogether belonging to the dark ages,\nnow. We have heard such beautiful stories, that we cannot manage to\nsleep at night, without knowing what they are all about. Now, do tell\nus everything. You may just as well tell us every single thing. We are\nsure to find it all out, you know; and then we shall all be down on\nyou. Among near relations, dear mamma says, there is nothing to compare\nwith candour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see, Alice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madge broke in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are sure to know sooner or\nlater; and how can it matter which it is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Alice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit cannot matter. And so you shall all\nknow, later.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis made the three sisters look a little at one another, quietly. And\nthen, as a desperate resource, Madge, the rough one, laid eyes upon\nAlice, and, with a piercing look, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even understand\nwhat it means yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, I do not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow many times have I told you\nso; yet you always want further particulars! Dear cousins, now you must\nbe satisfied with a conclusion of your own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot at all see that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Caroline.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, you are too bad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Margaret.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think that this is quite fair?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Cecil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are too many for me, all of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alice answered, steadfastly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose I came to your house and pried into some piece of gossip about\nyou, that I had picked up in the village. Would you think that I had a\nright to do it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, dear, of course not. But nobody dares to gossip about us, you\nknow. Papa would very soon stop all that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course he would. And because my father is too high-minded to meddle\nwith it, am I to be questioned perpetually? Come in, Caroline, come in,\nMargaret, come in, dear Cecil; I know where papa is, and then you can\nask him all about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have three little girls at their first sampler--such little sweets!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid Caroline; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only left them for half an hour, because we felt\nsure you must want us, darling. It now seems as if you could hold your\nown in a cross-stitch we must not penetrate. It is nothing to us. What\ncould it be? Only don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come, for goodness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come rushing\ndown the hill, dear creature, to implore our confidence suddenly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear creature!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice, for the moment borne beyond her young\nself-possession--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not quite accustomed to old women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words.\nNobody shall call me a \u00e2\u0080\u0098dear creature\u00e2\u0080\u0099 except my father (who knows\nbetter) and poor old Nanny Stilgoe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be vexed with them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cecil stopped to say in a quiet\nmanner, while the two other maidens tucked up their skirts, and down\nthe hill went, rapidly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey never meant to vex you, Alice; only you\nyourself must feel how dreadfully tantalizing it is to hear such sweet\nthings as really make us afraid of our own shadows; and then to be told\nnot to ask any questions!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry if I have been rude to your sisters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the placable Alice\nanswered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it is so vexatious of them that they doubt my word so.\nNow, tell me what you have heard. It is wonderful how any foolish story\nspreads.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe heard, on the very best authority, that the old astrologer appeared\nto you, descending from the comet in a fire-balloon, and warned you to\nprepare for the judgment-day, because the black-death would destroy in\none night every soul in Coombe Lorraine; and as soon as you heard it\nyou fainted away; and Sir Roland ran up, and found you lying, as white\nas wax, in a shroud made out of the ancient gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long foreign\ncloak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, beg Cousin Caroline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pardon for me. No wonder she wanted to\nhear more. And I must not be touchy about my veracity, after lying\nin my shroud so long. But truly I cannot tell you a word to surpass\nwhat you have heard already; nor even to come up to it. There was not\none single wonderful thing--not enough to keep up the interest. I was\nbitterly disappointed; and so, of course, was every one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCousin Alice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cecil answered, looking at her pleasantly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are\ndifferent from us, or, at any rate, from my sisters. You scarcely seem\nto know the way to tell the very smallest of small white lies. I am\nvery sorry always; still I must tell some of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Cecil, no. You need tell none; if you only make up your mind not\nto do it. You are but a very little older than I am, and surely you\nmight begin afresh. Suppose you say at your prayers in the morning,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Lord, let me tell no lie to-day!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Alice, you know that I never could do it. When I know that I mean\nto tell ever so many; how could I hope to be answered? No doubt I am a\nstory-teller--just the same as the rest of us; and to pray against it,\nwhen I mean to do it, would be a very double-faced thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, it would. It never struck me in that particular way\nbefore. But Uncle Struan must know best what ought to be done in your\ncase.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must not make a fuss of trifles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cecil answered, prudently; \u00e2\u0080\u009cpapa\ncan always speak for himself; and he means to come up the hill to do\nit, if Mr. Gates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pony is at home. And now I must run after them, or\nMadge will call me a little traitor. Oh, here papa comes, I do declare.\nGood-bye, darling, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be vexed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does seem a little too bad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Alice, as the portly form\nof the rector, mounted on a borrowed pony, came round the corner at\nthe bottom of the coombe, near poor Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hermitage--\u00e2\u0080\u009ca little too\nbad that nothing can be done, without its being chattered about. And\nI know how annoyed papa will be, if Uncle Struan comes plaguing him\nagain. We cannot even tell what it means ourselves; and whatever it\nmeans, it concerns us only. I do think curiosity is the worst, though\nit may be the smallest, vice. He expects to catch me, of course, and\nget it all out of me, as he declared he would. But sharp as his eyes\nare, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe he can have managed to spy me yet. I will off to\nmy rockwork, and hide myself, till I see the heels of his pony going\nsedately down the hill again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these words, she disappeared; and when the good rector had mounted\nthe hill, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice, Alice!\u00e2\u0080\u009d resounded vainly from the drive among the\nshrubs and flowers, and echoed from the ramparts of the coombe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nA RECTOR OF THE OLDEN STYLE.\n\n\nOne part of Coombe Lorraine is famous for a sevenfold echo, connected\nby tradition with a tale of gloom and terror. Mr. Hales, being proud\nof his voice, put this echo through all its peals, or chime of waning\nresonance. It could not quite answer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d with \u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well,\nPat, and the same to you\u00e2\u0080\u009d--and its tone was rather melancholy than\nsprightly, as some echoes are. But of course a great deal depended on\nthe weather, as well as on the time of day. Echo, for the most part,\nsleeps by daylight, and strikes her gong as the sun goes down.\n\nFailing of any satisfaction here, the Rev. Struan Hales rode on. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRide\non, ride on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his motto always; and he seldom found it fail.\nNevertheless, as he rang the bell (which he was at last compelled to\ndo), he felt in the crannies of his heart some wavers as to the job\nhe was come upon. A coarse nature often despises a fine one, and yet\nis most truly afraid of it. Mr. Hales believed that in knowledge of\nthe world he was entitled to teach Sir Roland; and yet could not help\nfeeling how calmly any impertinence would be stopped.\n\nThe clergyman found his brother-in-law sitting alone, as he was too\nfond of doing, in his little favourite book-room, walled off from\nthe larger and less comfortable library. Sir Roland was beginning to\nyield more and more to the gentle allurements of solitude. Some few\nmonths back he had lost the only friend with whom he had ever cared\nto interchange opinions, a learned parson of the neighbourhood, an\nantiquary, and an elegant scholar. And ever since that he had been\nsinking deeper and deeper into the slough of isolation and privacy.\nFor hours he now would sit alone, with books before him, yet seldom\nheeded, while he mused and meditated, or indulged in visions, mingled\nof the world he read of, and the world he had to deal with. As no\nless an authority than Dr. Johnson has it--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis invisible riot of the\nmind, this secret prodigality of being, is secure from detection, and\nfearless of reproach. The dreamer retires to his apartment, shuts out\nthe cares and interruptions of mankind, and abandons himself to his own\nfancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And again--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis captivity it is necessary for every man to\nbreak, who has any desire to be wise or useful. To regain liberty, he\nmust find the means of flying from himself; he must, in opposition to\nthe Stoic precept, teach his desires to fix upon external things; he\nmust adopt the joys and the pains of others, and excite in his mind the\nwant of social pleasures and amicable communication.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland Lorraine was not quite so bad as the gentleman above\ndepicted; still he was growing so like him, that he was truly sorry to\nsee the jovial face of his brother-in-law. For his mind was set out\nupon a track of thought, which it might have pursued until dinner-time.\nBut, of course, he was much too courteous to show any token of\ninterruption.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, I must have you out of this. My dear fellow, what are you\ncoming to? Books, books, books! As if you did not know twice too much\nalready! Even I find my flesh falling away from me, the very next day\nafter I begin to punish it with reading.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat very remark occurs in the book which I have just put down.\nStruan, let me read it to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you greatly, but would rather not. It is in Latin or Greek,\nof course. I could not do my duty as I do, if I lost my way in those\ndead languages. But I have the rarest treat for you; and I borrowed a\npony, to come and fetch you. Such a badger you never saw! Sir Remnant\nis coming to see it, and so is old General Jakes, and a dozen more. We\nallow an hour for that, and then we have a late dinner at six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\nMy daughters came up the hill, to fetch your young Alice to see the\nsport. But they had some blaze-up about some trifle; as the chittish\ncreatures are always doing. And so pretty Alice perhaps will lose it.\nLeave them to their own ways, say I: leave them to their own ways, Sir\nRoland. They are sure to cheat us, either way; and they may just as\nwell cheat us pleasantly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou take a sensible view of it, according to what your daughters\nare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered, more sharply than he either meant or could\nmaintain; and immediately he was ashamed of himself. But Mr. Hales was\nnot thin of skin; and he knew that his daughters were true to him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas I said before, they are full of tricks.\nAt their age and sex it must be so. But a better and kinder team of\nmaids is not to be found in thirteen parishes. Speak to the contrary\nwho will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that they are very good girls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered kindly;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice likes them very much: and so does everybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is enough to show what they are. Nobody ever likes anybody,\nwithout a great deal of cause for it. They must have their faults,\nof course, we know; and they may not be quite butter-lipped, you\nknow--still I should like to see a better lot, take them in and out and\naltogether. Now you must come and see Fox draw that badger. I have ten\ngood guineas upon it with Jakes; Sir Remnant was too shy to stake. And\nI want a thoroughly impartial judge. You never would refuse me, Roland,\nnow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Struan, yes; you know well that I will. You know that I hate and\ndespise cruel sports: and it is no compliment to invite me, when you\nknow that I will not come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I had stayed at the bottom of the hill, where that young scamp\nof a boy lives. When will you draw that badger, Sir Roland, the pest of\nthe Downs, and of all the county?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStruan, the boy is not half so bad as might be expected of him. I have\nthought once or twice that I ought to have him taught, and fed, and\ncivilized.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSend him to me, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll civilize him. A born little poacher! I have\nscared all the other poachers with the comet; but the little thief\nnever comes to church. Four pair of birds, to my knowledge, nested in\nJohn Gates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vetches, and hatched well, too, for I spoke to John--where\nare they? Can you tell me where they are?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Struan, I give you the shooting, of course; but I leave it to\nyou to look after it. But it does seem too cruel to kill the birds,\nbefore they can fly for you to shoot them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCruel! I call it much worse than cruel. Such things would never be\ndreamed of upon a properly managed property.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are going a little too far,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland, with one of his very\npeculiar looks; and his brother-in-law drew back at once, and changed\nthe subject clumsily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe shooting will do well enough, Sir Roland; I think, however,\nthat you may be glad of my opinion upon other matters. And that had\nsomething to do with my coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I thought that you came about the badger, Struan. But what are\nthese, even more serious matters?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cConcerning your dealings with the devil, Roland. Of course, I never\nlisten to anything foolish. Still, for the sake of my parish, I am\nbound to know what your explanation is. I have not much faith in\nwitchcraft; though in that perhaps I am heterodox; but we are bound to\nhave faith in the devil, I hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour hope does you credit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut for the moment I\nfail to see how I am concerned with this orthodoxy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, my dear fellow, my dear fellow, you know as well as I do, what I\nmean. Of course there is a great deal of exaggeration; and knowing you\nso well, I have taken on myself to deny a great part of what people\nsay. But you know the old proverb, \u00e2\u0080\u0098No smoke without fire;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and I could\ndefend you so much better, if I knew what really had occurred. And\nbesides all that, you must feel, I am sure, that you are not treating\nme with that candour which our long friendship and close connection\nentitle me to expect from you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour last argument is the only one requiring any answer. Those based\non religious, social, and even parochial grounds, do not apply to this\ncase at all. But I should be sorry to vex you, Struan, or keep from you\nanything you claim to know in right of your dear sister. This matter,\nhowever, is so entirely confined to those of our name only; at the same\ntime so likely to charm all the gossips who have made such wild guesses\nabout it; and, after all, it is such a trifle except to a superstitious\nmind; that I may trust your good sense to be well content to hear no\nmore about it, until it comes into action--if it ever should do so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, Sir Roland, of course you know best. I am the last man in\nthe world to intrude into family mysteries. And my very worst enemy\n(if I have one) would never dream of charging me with the vice of\ncuriosity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course not. And therefore you will be well pleased that we should\ndrop this subject. Will you take white wine, or red wine, Struan? Your\nkind and good wife was quite ready to scold me, for having forgotten my\nduty in that, the last time you came up the hill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, then I walked--to-day I am riding. I thank you, I thank you, Sir\nRoland; but the General and Sir Remnant are waiting for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, most important of all, the badger. Good-bye, Struan; I shall see\nyou soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hardly know whether you will or not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the rector answered testily;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is the time when those cursed poachers scarcely allow me a good\nnight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rest. And to come up this hill; and hear nothing at the top! It\nis too bad at my time of life! After two services every Sunday, to have\nto be gamekeeper all the week!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt your time of life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland, kindly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, you are the\nyoungest man in the parish, so far as life and spirits go. To-day you\nare not yourself at all. Struan, you have not sworn one good round\noath!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, what can you expect, Roland, with these confounded secrets held\nover one? I feel myself many pegs down to-day. And that pony trips so\nabominably. Perhaps, after all, I might take one glass of red wine,\nbefore I go down the hill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a duty you owe to the parish. Now come, and let me try to find\nAlice, to wait upon you. Alice is always so glad to see you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I am always so glad to see her. How narrow your doors are in these\nold houses! Those Normans must have been a skewer-shouldered lot. Now,\nRoland, if I have said anything harsh, you will make all allowance for\nme, of course; because you know the reason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean that you are a little disappointed----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a bit of it. Quite the contrary. But after such weather as\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had, and nothing but duty, duty, to do--one is apt to get\na little crotchety. What kind of sport can be got anywhere? The\nlandrail-shooting is over, of course, and the rabbits are running in\nfamilies; the fish are all sulky, and the water low, and the sea-trout\nnot come up yet. There are no young hounds fit to handle yet; and the\nground cracks the heels of a decent hack. One\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth only waters at\noiling a gun; all the best of the cocks are beginning to mute; and if\none gets up a badger-bait, to lead to a dinner-party, people will come,\nand look on, and make bets, and then tell the women how cruel it was!\nAnd with all the week thus, I am always expected to say something new,\nevery Sunday morning!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, nay, Struan. Come now; we have never expected that of you. But\nhere comes Alice, from her gardening work! Now, she does look well;\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think she does?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a rose in June, but a rose in May!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the rector answered gallantly,\nkissing his hand to his niece, and then with his healthy bright lips\nsaluting her: \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou grow more and more like your mother, darling. Ah,\nwhen I think of the bygone days, before I had any wife, or daughters,\nthings occur to me that never----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo and bait your badger, Struan, after one more glass of wine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nA NOTABLE LADY.\n\n\nNature appears to have sternly willed that no man shall keep a secret.\nThere is a monster, here and there perhaps to be discovered, who can\nsustain his boast of never whispering anything; but he ought to expect\nto be put aside, in our estimate of humanity. And in compensation, the\npowers above provide him, for the most part, with a wife of fecund\nloquacity.\n\nA word is enough on such parlous themes; and the least said, the\nsoonest mended. What one of us is not exceeding wise, in his own, or\nhis wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion? What one of us does not pretend to be as \u00e2\u0080\u009creticent\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nas Minerva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s owl; and yet in his heart confess that a secret is apt to\nfly out of his bosom?\n\nNature is full of rules; and if the above should happen to be one of\nthem, it was illustrated in the third attack upon Sir Roland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secrecy.\nFor scarcely had he succeeded in baffling, without offending, his\nbrother-in-law, when a servant brought him a summons from his mother,\nLady Valeria.\n\nAccording to all modern writers, whether of poetry or prose, in our\nadmirable language, the daughter of an earl is always lovely, graceful,\nirresistible; almost to as great an extent as she is unattainable.\nThis is but a natural homage on the part of nature to a power so far\nabove her; so that this daughter of an Earl of Thanet had been, in\nevery outward point, whatever is delightful. Neither had she shown any\nslackness in turning to the best account these notable gifts in her\nfavour. In short, she had been a very beautiful woman, and had employed\nher beauty well, in having her own will and way. She had not married\nwell, it is true, in the opinion of her compeers; but she had pleased\nherself, and none could say that she had lowered her family. The\nancestors of Lord Thanet had held in villeinage of the Lorraines, some\nthree or four hundred years after the Conquest, until, from being under\nso gentle a race, they managed to get over them.\n\nLady Valeria knew all this; and feeling as all women feel, the\nownership of her husband (active or passive, whichever it be), she\nthrew herself into the nest of Lorraine, and having no portion, waived\nall past obligation to parental ties. This was a noble act on her part,\nas her husband always said. He, Sir Roger Lorraine, lay under her\nthumb, as calmly as need be; yet was pleased as the birth of children\ngave some distribution of pressure. For the lady ruled the house, and\nlands, and all that was therein, as if she had brought them under her\nsettlement.\n\nAlthough Sir Roger had now been sleeping, for a good many years, with\nhis fathers, his widow, Lady Valeria, showed no sign of any preparation\nfor sleeping with her mothers. Now in her eighty-second year, this lady\nwas as brisk and active, at least in mind, if not in body, as half\na century ago she had been. Many good stories (and some even true)\nwere told concerning her doings and sayings in the time of her youth\nand beauty. Doings were always put first, because for these she was\nmore famous, having the wit of ready action more than of rapid words,\nperhaps. And yet in the latter she was not slack, when once she had\ntaken up the quiver of the winged poison. She had seen so much of the\nworld, and of the loftiest people that dwell therein--so far at least\nas they were to be found at the Court of George the Second--that she\nsat in an upper stratum now over all she had to deal with. And yet she\nwas not of a narrow mind, when unfolded out of her creases.\n\nHer set of rooms was the best in the house, of all above the\nground-floor at least; and now she was waiting to receive her son, with\nher usual little bit of state. For the last five years she had ceased\nto appear at the table where once she ruled supreme; and the servants,\nwho never had blessed her before, blessed her and themselves for that\nhappy change. For she would have her due as firmly and fairly (if not a\ntrifle more so), as and than she gave the same to others, if undemanded.\n\nIn her upright seat she was now beginning--not to chafe, for such a\nthing would have been below her--but rather to feel her sense of right\nand duty (as owing to herself) becoming more and more grievous to her\nthe longer she was kept waiting. She had learned long ago that she\ncould not govern her son as absolutely as she was wont to rule his\nfather; and having a clearer perception of her own will than of large\nprinciples, whenever she found him immovable, she set the cause down as\nprejudice. Yet by feeling her way among these prejudices carefully, and\nworking filial duty hard, and flying as a last resort to the stronghold\nof her many years, she pretty nearly always managed to get her own way\nin everything.\n\nBut few of those who pride themselves on their knowledge of the\nhuman face would have perceived in this lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s features any shape of\nsteadfast will. Perhaps the expression had passed away, while the\nsubstance settled inwards: but however that may have been, her face\nwas pleasant, calm, and gentle. Her manner also to all around her was\ncourteous, kind, and unpretending; and people believed her to have\nno fault, until they began to deal with her. Her eyes, not overhung\nwith lid, but delicately set and shaped, were still bright, and of a\npale-blue tint; her forehead was not remarkably large, but straight,\nand of beautiful outline; while the filaments of fine wrinkles took,\nin some lights, a cast of silver from snowy silkiness of hair. For\nstill she had abundant hair, that crown of glory to old age; and, like\na young girl, she still took pleasure in having it drawn through the\nhands, and done wisely, and tired to the utmost vantage.\n\nSir Roland came into his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room with his usual care and\ndiligence. She with ancient courtesy rose from her straight-backed\nchair, and offered him one little hand, and smiled at him; and from the\nmanner of that smile he knew that she was not by any means pleased, but\nthought it as well to conciliate him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, you know that I never pay heed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began, with a voice that\nshook just a little, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto rumours that reach me through servants, or\neven allow them to think of telling me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear mother, of course you never do. Such a thing would be far beneath\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, you might wait till I have spoken, before you begin to\njudge me. If I listen to nothing, I must be quite unlike all the other\nwomen in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so you are. How well you express it! At last you begin to\nperceive, my dear mother, what I perpetually urge in vain--your own\nsuperiority.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother can be expected to endure mild irony, even half so\nwell as his wife would?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, this manner of speech,--I know not what to call it, but I have\nheard of it among foreign people years ago,--whatever it is, I beg you\nnot to catch it from that boy Hilary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoetical justice!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland exclaimed; for his temper was always in\ngood control, by virtue of varied humour; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is the self-same whip\nwherewith I scourged little Alice, quite lately! Only I feel that I was\nfar more just.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, you are always just. You may not be always wise, of course;\nbut justice you have inherited from your dear father, and from me.\nAnd this is the reason why I wish to know what is the meaning of the\nstrange reports, which almost any one, except myself, would have been\nsure to go into, or must have been told of long ago. Your thorough\ntruthfulness I know. And you have no chance to mislead me now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will imitate, though perhaps I cannot equal, your candour, my dear\nmother, by assuring you that I greatly prefer to keep my own counsel in\nthis matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, is that your answer? You admit that there is something\nimportant, and you refuse to let your own mother know it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExcuse me, but I do not remember saying anything about \u00e2\u0080\u0098importance.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nI am not superstitious enough to suppose that the thing can have any\nimportance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen why should you make such a fuss about it? Really, Roland, you are\nsometimes very hard to understand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was not aware that I had made a fuss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered, gravely;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut if I have, I will make no more. Now, my dear mother, what did you\nthink of that extraordinary bill of Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBottler, the pigman, is a rogue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her ladyship, peremptorily:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009chis father was a rogue before him; and those things run in families.\nBut surely you cannot suppose that this is the proper way to treat the\nsubject.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo my mind a most improper way--to condemn a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bill on the ground\nthat his father transmitted the right to overcharge!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, my dear son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lady Valeria, who never called him her son at\nall, unless she was put out with him, and her \u00e2\u0080\u009cdear son\u00e2\u0080\u009d only when she\nwas at the extremity of endurance--\u00e2\u0080\u009cmy dear son, these are sad attempts\nto disguise the real truth from me. The truth I am entitled to know,\nand the truth I am resolved to know. And I think that you might have\npaid me the compliment of coming for my advice before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFinding her in this state of mind, and being unable to deny the\njustice of her claim, Sir Roland was fain at last to make a virtue of\nnecessity, while he marvelled (as so many have done) at the craft of\npeople in spying things, and espying them always wrongly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lady Valeria, after listening carefully; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought\nthere must have been something a little better than that, to justify\nyou in making it such a mystery. Nothing but a dusty old document,\nand a strange-looking package, or case like a cone! However, I do not\nblame you, my dear Roland, for making so small a discovery. The old\nastrologer appears to me to have grown a little childish. Now, as I\nkeep to the old-fashioned hours, I will ask you to ring the bell for my\ntea; and while it is being prepared, you can fetch me the case itself,\nand the document to examine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, my dear mother, if you will only promise to obey the\ncommands of the document.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, I have lived too long ever to promise anything. You shall read\nme these orders, and then I can judge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will make no fuss about such a trifle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, with a pleasant\nsmile; \u00e2\u0080\u009cof course you will do what is honourable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSurely men, although they deny so ferociously this impeachment, are\nopen at times to at least a little side-eddy of curiosity; Sir Roland,\nno doubt, was desirous to know what were the contents of that old\ncase, which Alice had taken for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty cushion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as it lay at the\nback of the cupboard in the wall; while his honour would not allow him\ncomfortably to disobey the testator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish. At the same time he felt,\nevery now and then, that to treat such a matter in a serious light, was\na proof of superstition, or even childishness, on his part. And now, if\nhis mother should so regard it, he was not at all sure that he ought to\ntake the unpleasant course of opposing her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nA MALIGNANT CASE.\n\n\nSir Roland smiled at his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position, and air of stern attention,\nas he came back from his book-room with a small but heavy oaken box.\nThis he placed on a chair, and without any mystery, unlocked it. But no\nsooner had he flung back the lid and shown the case above described,\nthan he was quite astonished at the expression of Lady Valeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\nSomething more than fear, a sudden terror, as if at the sight of\nsomething fatal, had taken the pale tint out of her cheeks, and made\nher fine forehead quiver.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear mother, how foolish I am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto worry you with these\ntrifles! I wish I had kept to my own opinion----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is no trifle; you would have been wrong to treat it as a trifle.\nI have lived a long life, and seen many strange things; it takes more\nthan a trifle to frighten me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor a minute or two she lay back, and was not fit to speak or be spoken\nto; only she managed to stop her son from ringing for her maid or\nthe housekeeper. He had never beheld her so scared before, and could\nscarcely make out her signs to him that she needed no attendance.\n\nLike most men who are at all good and just, Sir Roland was prone to\nthink softly and calmly, instead of acting rapidly; and now his mother,\nso advanced in years, showed less hesitation than he did. Recovering,\nere long, from that sudden shock, she managed to smile at herself and\nat his anxiety about her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Roland, I will not meddle with this formidable and clumsy thing.\nIt seems to be closed most jealously. It has kept for two centuries,\nand may keep for two more, so far as I am concerned. But if it will not\nbe too troublesome to you, I should like to hear what is said about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this old document, madam? Do you see how strangely it has been\nfolded? Whoever did that knew a great deal more than now we know about\nfolding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe writing to me seems more strange than the folding. What a cramped\nhand! In what language is it written?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Greek, the old Greek character, and the Doric dialect. He seems to\nhave been proud of his classic descent, and perhaps Dorian lineage.\nBut he placed a great deal too much faith in the attainments of his\ndescendants. Poor Sedley would have read it straight off, I daresay;\nbut the contractions, and even some of the characters, puzzled me\ndreadfully. I have kept up, as you know, dear mother, whatever little\nGreek I was taught, and perhaps have added to it; but my old Hedericus\nwas needed a great many times, I assure you, before I got through this\nqueer document; and even now I am not quite certain of the meaning of\none or two passages. You see at the head a number of what I took at\nfirst to be hieroglyphics of some kind or other; but I find that they\nare astral or sidereal signs, for which I am none the wiser, though\nperhaps an astronomer would be. This, for instance, appears to mean the\nconjunction of some two planets, and this----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind them, Roland. Read me what you have made out of the\nwriting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, mother. But if I am at fault, you must have patience with\nme, for I am not perfect in my lesson yet. Thus it begins:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Behold, ye men, who shall be hereafter, and pay heed to this matter.\nA certain Carian, noble by birth and of noble character, to whom is the\nnot inglorious name, Agasicles Syennesis, hath lived not in the pursuit\nof wealth, or power, or reputation, but in the unbroken study of the\nmost excellent arts and philosophies. Especially in the heavenly stars,\nand signs of the everlasting kosmos, hath he disciplined his mind, and\nsurpassed all that went before him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 There is nothing like self-praise,\nis there, now, dear mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no doubt that he speaks the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Lady Valeria:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not marry into a family accustomed to exaggerate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen what do you think of this? \u00e2\u0080\u0098Not only in intellect and\nforethought, but also in goodwill and philanthropy, modesty, and\nself-forgetfulness, did this man win the prize of excellence; and he it\nis who now speaks to you. Having lived much time in a barbarous island,\ncold, and blown over with vaporous air, he is no longer of such a sort\nas he was in the land of the fair afternoons. And there is when it is\nto his mind a manifest and established thing, that the gates of Hades\nare open for him, and the time of being no longer. But he holds this to\nbe of the smallest difference, if only the gods produce his time to the\nperfect end of all the things lying now before him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow good, and how truly pious of him, Roland? Such a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter\nnever could have had any right to run away from him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear mother, I disagree with you, if he always praised himself in\nthat style. But let him speak for himself again, as he seems to know\nvery well how to do: \u00e2\u0080\u0098These things have not been said, indeed, for\nthe sake of any boasting, but rather to bring out thoroughly forward\nthe truth in these things lying under, as if it were a pavement of\nadamant. Now, therefore, know ye, that Agasicles, carefully pondering\neverything, has found (so to say the word) an end to accomplish, and\nto abide in. And this is no other thing, than to save the generations\ndescended from him, from great evil fortunes about to fall, by the\nill-will of some divinity, at a destined time, upon them. For a man,\nof birth so renowned and lofty, has not been made to resemble a\nhand-worker, or a runaway slave; but has many stars regarding him,\nfrom many generations. And now he perceives, that his skill and wisdom\nwere not given to him to be a mere personal adornment; but that he\nmight protect his descendants, to the remote futurity. To him, then--it\nhaving been revealed, that in the seventh generation hence, as has\noften come to pass with our house, or haply in the tenth (for the\ntime is misty), a great calamity is bound to happen to those born\nafar off from Syennesis--the sage has laboured many labours, though\nhe cannot avert, at least to make it milder, and to lessen it. He has\nnot, indeed, been made to know, at least up to the present time, what\nthis bane will be; or whether after the second, or after the third\ncentury from this period. But knowing the swiftness of evil chance, he\nexpects it at the earlier time; and whatever its manner or kind may\nbe, Agasicles in all his discoveries has discovered no cure for human\nevils, save that which he now has shut up in a box. This box has been\nso constructed, that nothing but dust will meet the greedy eyes of any\nwho force it open, in the manner of the tomb of Nitocris. But if be\nopened with the proper key, and after the proper interval, when the\ndue need has arisen--there will be a fairer sight than ever broke upon\nmortal eyes before.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere mother, now, what do you think of all that? I am quite out of\nbreath with my long translation, and I am not quite sure of all of it.\nFor instance, where he says----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his mother answered quickly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am now much older than the\nprince, according to tradition, can have been. But I make no pretence\nto his wisdom; and I have reasons of my own for wondering. What have\nyou done with the key of that case?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never seen it. It was not in the closet. And I meant to have\nsearched, throughout his room, until I found out the meaning of this\nvery crabbed postscript--\u00e2\u0080\u0098That fool, Memel, hath lost the key. It will\ncost me months to make another. My hands now tremble, and my eyes are\nweak. If there be no key found herewith, let it be read that Nature,\nwhom I have vanquished, hath avenged herself. Whether, or no, have I\nlaboured in vain? Be blest now, and bless me, my dear descendants.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat appears to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Lady Valeria, being left in good manners\nby her son, to express the first opinion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be of the whole of this\nstrange affair the part that is least satisfactory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear mother, you have hit the mark. What satisfaction can one find\nin having a case without a key, and knowing that if we force it open\nthere will be nothing but dust inside? Not a quarter so good as a\nsnuff-box. I must have a pinch, my dear mother, excuse me, while you\nmeditate on this subject. You are far more indulgent in that respect\nthan little Alice ever is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll gentlemen take snuff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho is Alice, to lay down\nthe law? Your father took a boxful three times a week. Roland, you let\nthat young girl take great liberties with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not so much that I let her take them. I have no voice in the\nmatter now. She takes them without asking me. Possibly that is the\ngreat calamity foretold by the astrologer. If not, what other can it\nbe, do you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, with a serious air, for all her experience of\nthe witty world had left her old age quite dry of humour; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe trouble,\nif any is coming, will not be through Alice, but through Hilary. Alice\nis certainly a flighty girl, romantic, and full of nonsense, and\nnot at all such as she might have been, if left more in my society.\nHowever, she never has thought it worth while to associate much with\nher grandmother; the result of which is that her manners are unformed,\nand her mind is full of nonsense. But she has plenty, and (if it were\npossible) too much of that great preservative--pride of birth. Alice\nmay come to affliction herself; but she never will involve her family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny affliction of hers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill involve at least her\nfather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, of course. But what I mean is the honour and rank of the\nfamily. It is my favourite Hilary, my dear, brave, handsome Hilary, who\nis likely to bring care on our heads, or rather upon your head, Roland;\nmy time, of course, will be over then, unless he is very quick about\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe will not be so quick as that, I hope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered, with\nsome little confusion of proper sentiments; \u00e2\u0080\u009calthough in that hotbed of\nmischief, London, nobody knows when he may begin. However, he is not in\nLondon at present, according to your friend Lady de Lampnor. I think\nyou said you had heard so from her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, Mr. Malahide told her himself. The dear boy has\noverworked himself so, that he has gone to some healthy and quiet\nplace, to recruit his exhausted energies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could never believe it, unless I knew\nfrom experience, what a very little work is enough to upset him. To\nwrite a letter to his father, for instance, is so severe an exertion,\nthat he requires a holiday the next day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Roland, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so hard upon him. You would apprentice him to\nthat vile law, which is quite unfit for a gentleman. I am not surprised\nat his being overcome by such odious labour; you would not take my\nadvice, remember, and put him into the only profession fit for one of\nhis birth--the army. Whatever happens, the fault is your own. It is\nclear, however, that he cannot get into much mischief where he is just\nnow--a rural and quiet part of Kent, she says. It shows the innocence\nof his heart to go there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery likely. But if he wanted change, he might have asked leave to\ncome home, I think. However, we shall have him here soon enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow you speak, Roland! Quite as if you cared not a farthing for your\nonly son! It must be dreadfully galling to him, to see how you prefer\nthat Alice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he is galled, he never winces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Sir Roland with a quiet\nsmile; \u00e2\u0080\u009che is the most careless fellow in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the most good-natured, and the most affectionate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lady\nValeria, warmly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing else could keep him from being jealous, as\nnine out of ten would be. However, I am tired of talking now, and on\nthat subject I might talk for ever. Take away that case, if you please,\nand the writing. On no account would I have them left here. Of course\nyou will lock them away securely, and not think of meddling with them.\nWhat is that case made of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can scarcely make out. Something strong and heavy. A mixture, I\nthink, of shagreen and some metal. But the oddest thing of all is the\nkeyhole. It is at the top of the cone, you see, and of the strangest\nshape, an irregular heptagon, with some rare complications of points\ninside. It would be next to impossible to open this case, without\nshattering it altogether.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not wish to examine the case, I wish to have it taken away, my\nson. There, there, I am very glad not to see it; although I am sure I\nam not superstitious. We shall do very well, I trust, without it. I\nthink it is a most extraordinary thing that your father never consulted\nme about the writing handed down to you. He must have been bound by\nsome pledge not to do so. There, Roland, I am tired of the subject.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these words the ancient lady waved her delicate hand, and\ndismissed her son, who kissed her white forehead, according to usage,\nand then departed with case and parchment locked in the oaken box\nagain. But the more he thought over her behaviour, the more he was\npuzzled about it. He had fully expected a command to open the case, at\nwhatever hazard; and perhaps he had been disappointed at receiving no\nsuch order. But above all, he wanted to know why his mother should have\nbeen taken aback, as she was, by the sight of these little things. For\nfew people, even in the prime of life, possessed more self-command and\ncourage than Lady Valeria, now advancing into her eighty-second year.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nTHE BAITER BAITED.\n\n\nAt the top of the hill, these lofty themes were being handled worthily;\nwhile, at the bottom, little cares had equal glance of the democrat\nsun, but no stars allotted to regard them. In plain English,--Bonny and\nJack were as busy as their betters. They had taken their usual round\nthat morning, seeking the staff of life--if that staff be applicable\nto a donkey--in village, hamlet, and farm-house, or among the lanes\nand hedges. The sympathy and goodwill between them daily grew more\nintimate, and their tastes more similar; so that it scarcely seemed\nimpossible that Bonny in the end might learn to eat clover, and Jack to\nrejoice in money. Open air, and roving life, the ups and downs of want\nand weal, the freedom of having nothing to lose, and the joyful luck of\nfinding things--these, and perhaps a little spice of unknown sweetness\nin living at large on their fellow-creatures\u00e2\u0080\u0099 labours, combined to make\nthem as happy a pair, as the day was long, or the weather good. In the\nwinter--ah! why should we think of such trouble? Perhaps there will\nnever be winter again.\n\nAt any rate, Bonny was sitting in front of the door of his castle (or\nrather in front of the doorway, because he was happy enough not to\nhave a door), as proud and contented as if there could never be any\nmore winter of discontent. He had picked up a hat in a ditch that day,\nlost by some man going home from his inn; and knowing from his patron,\nthe pigman Bottler, that the surest token of a blameless life is to\nbe found in the hat of a man, the boy, stirred by the first heave of\nambition, had put on this hat, and was practising hat-craft (having\ngone with his head as it was born hitherto), to the utter surprise, and\nwith the puzzled protest, of his beloved donkey. It was a most steady\nchurch-going hat of the chimney-pot order (then newly imported into\nbenighted regions, but now of the essence of a godly life all over this\nfree country), neither was it such a shocking bad hat as a man would\ncast away, if his wife were near. For Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s young head it was a world\ntoo wide, but he had padded it with a blackbird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest; and though it\nseemed scarcely in harmony with his rakish waistcoat, and bare red\nshanks (spread on the grass for exhibition, and starred with myriad\nfurze and bramble), still he was conscious of a distinguished air, and\nnodded to the donkey to look at him.\n\nWhile these were gazing at one another, with free interchange of\nopinion, the rector of the parish, on his little pony, turned the\ncorner bluntly. He was on his way home, at the bottom of the coombe,\nnot in the very best temper perhaps, in spite of the sport in prospect;\nbecause Sir Roland had met so unkindly his kind desire to know things.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have you got on your lap, boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Hales so strongly shouted,\nthat sulky Echo pricked her ears; and \u00e2\u0080\u009con your lap, boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d went all up\nthe lonely coombe melodiously.\n\nBonny knew well what was on his lap--a cleverly-plaited hare-wire.\nBottler had shown him how to do it, and now he was practising\ndiligently, under the auspices of his first hat. Mr. Hales was a\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbeak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d of course; and the aquiline beak of the neighbourhood. Bonny\nhad the honour of his acquaintance, in that fierce aspect, and in no\nother. The little boy knew that there was a church, and that great\npeople went there once a-week, for still greater people to blow them\nup. But this only made him the more uneasy, to clap his bright eyes on\nthe parson.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold there! whoa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d called the Rev. Struan, as Bonny for his life began\nto cut away; \u00e2\u0080\u009cboy, I want to talk to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBonny was by no means touched with this very fine benevolence. Taking,\nperhaps, a low view of duty, he made the ground hot, to escape what we\nnow call the \u00e2\u0080\u009csacerdotal office.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Struan Hales (unlike our parsons)\nknew how to manage the laity. He clapped himself and his pony, in no\ntime, between Master Bonny and his hole, and then in calm dignity\ncalled a halt, with his riding-whip ready at his button-hole.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is--it is--it is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Bonny, coming back with his head on his\nchest, and meaning (in the idiom of the land) that now he was beaten,\nand would hold parley.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, it is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the rector answered, keeping a good balance on his\npony, and well pleased with his own tactics. He might have chased Bonny\nfor an hour in vain, through the furze, and heather, and blackberries;\nbut here he had him at his mercy quite, through his knowledge of human\nnature. To put it coarsely--as the rector did in his mental process\nhaply--the bigger thief anybody is, the more sacred to him is his\nproperty. Not that Bonny was a thief at all; still, that was how Mr.\nHales looked at it. In the flurry of conscience, the boy forgot that a\ncamel might go through the eye of a needle with less exertion than the\nparish incumbent must use to get into the Bonny-castle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh hoo, oh hoo, oh hoo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d howled Bonny, having no faith in clerical\nhonour, and foreseeing the sack of his palace, and home.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me that wire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Hales, in a voice from the depth of his\nwaistcoat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, my boy, would you like to be a good boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir; no, sir; oh no, plaize, sir! Jack nor me couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear it,\nsir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not, my boy? It is such a fine thing. Your face shows that you\nare a sharp boy. Why do you go on living in a hole, and poaching, and\npicking, and stealing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlaize, sir, I never steals nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, without it is somethin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbelong to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat may be. But why should you steal even that? Shall I go in, and\nsteal your things now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh hoo, oh hoo, oh hoo! Plaize, sir, I ha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for \u00e2\u0080\u0099e to\nsteal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not at all sure of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the rector, looking at the\nhermit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hole longingly; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca thief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s den is often as good as the bank.\nNow, who taught you how to make this snare? I thought I knew them all\npretty well; but this wire has a dodge quite new to me. Who taught you,\nyou young scamp, this moment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlaize, sir, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell \u00e2\u0080\u0099e, sir. Nobody taught me, as I knows on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou young liar, you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t teach yourself. What you mean is, that\nyou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t choose to tell me. Know, I must, and know I will, if I\nhave to thrash it out of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He had seized him now by his gorgeous\nwaistcoat, and held the strong horsewhip over his back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, will you\ntell, or will you not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI \u00e2\u0080\u0099ont, I \u00e2\u0080\u0099ont. If \u00e2\u0080\u0099e kills me, I \u00e2\u0080\u0099ont,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the boy cried, wriggling\nvainly, and with great tears of anticipation rolling down his sun-burnt\ncheeks.\n\nThe parson admired the pluck of the boy, knowing his own great strength\nof course, and feeling that if he began to smite, the swing of his arm\nwould increase his own wrath, and carry him perhaps beyond reason.\nTherefore he offered him one chance more. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you tell, sir, or will\nyou not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI \u00e2\u0080\u0099ont tell; that I \u00e2\u0080\u0099ont,\u00e2\u0080\u009d screamed Bonny; and at the word the lash\ndescended. But only once, for the smiter in a moment was made aware of\na dusty rush, a sharp roar of wrath, and great teeth flashing under\nmighty jaws. And perhaps he would never have walked again if he had not\nmost suddenly wheeled his pony, and just escaped a tremendous snap,\nwell aimed at his comely and gaitered calf.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOds bods!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the parson, as he saw the jackass (with a\nstretched-out neck, and crest erect, eyes flashing fire, and a lashing\ntail, and, worst of all terrors, those cavernous jaws) gathering legs\nfor a second charge, like an Attic trireme, Phormio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, backing\nwater for the diecplus.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I be dashed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the rector shouted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I deal any more with such\nanimals! If I had only got my hunting-crop; but, kuk, kuk, kuk, pony!\nQuick, for God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake! Off with you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith a whack of full power on the pony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flanks, away went he at full\ngallop; while Jack tossed his white nose with high disdain, and then\nstarted at a round trot in pursuit, to scatter them more disgracefully,\nand after them sent a fine flourish of trumpets, to the grand old\nnational air of hee-haw.\n\nWhile the Rev. Struan Hales was thus in sore discomfiture fleeing away\nas hard as his pony could be made to go, and casting uneasy glances\nover one shoulder at his pursuer, behold, he almost rode over a\ntraveller footing it lightly round a corner of the lane!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Uncle Struan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the latter; \u00e2\u0080\u009cis the dragon of St.\nLeonard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flying after you? Or is this the usual style of riding of the\nbeneficed clergy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHilary, my dear boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the rector; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho would have thought\nof seeing you? You are just come in time to defend your uncle from a\nravenous beast of prey. I was going home to bait a badger, but I have\nhad a pretty good bait myself. Ah, you pagan, you may well be ashamed\nof yourself, to attack your clergyman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor Jack, perceiving the reinforcement, and eyeing the stout stick\nwhich Hilary bore, prudently turned on his tail and departed, well\nsatisfied with his exploit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Hilary, what has brought you home?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked his uncle, when a few\nwords had passed concerning Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behaviour. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody expects you, that\nI know of. Your father is a mysterious man; but Alice would have been\nsure to tell me. Moreover, you must have walked all the way from the\nstage, by the look of your buckles; or perhaps from Brighton even.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; I took the short cut over the hills, and across by way of Beeding.\nNobody expects me, as you say. I am come on important business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, of course, I am not to know what it is. For mystery, and for\nkeeping secrets, there never was such a family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs if you did not belong to it, uncle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hilary answered,\ngood-naturedly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never heard of any secrets that I can remember.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd good reason too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the rector; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey would not long have\nbeen secrets, my boy, after they came to your ears, I doubt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen let me establish my reputation by keeping my own, at any rate.\nBut, after all, it is no secret, uncle. Only, my father ought to know\nit first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas, you rogue, you rogue! Something about money, no doubt. You used\nto condescend to come to me when you were at school and college. But\nnow, you are too grand for the purse of any poor Sussex rector. I could\nput off our badger for half-an-hour, if you think you could run down\nthe hill again. I should like you particularly to see young Fox; it\nwill be something grand, my boy. He is the best pup I ever had in all\nmy life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know him, uncle; I know what he is. I chose him first out of the\nlitter, you know. But you must not think of waiting for me. If I come\ndown the hill again, it will only be about eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock for an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nrabbit-shooting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSince he first met Mabel Lovejoy, Hilary had been changing much, and\nin every way for the better. Her gentleness, and soft regard, and\nsimple love of living things (at a time when cruelty was the rule, and\nkindness the rare exception), together with her knowledge of a great\ndeal more than he had ever noticed in the world around, made him feel,\nin his present vein of tender absence from her, as if he never could\nbear to see the baiting of any badger. Therefore he went on his way to\nhis father, pitying all things that were tormented.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nA FATHERLY SUGGESTION.\n\n\nSir Roland Lorraine, in his little book-room, after that long talk with\nhis mother, had fallen back into the chair of reflection, now growing\nmore and more dear to him. He hoped for at least a good hour of peace\nto think of things, and to compare them with affairs that he had read\nof. It was all a trifle, of course, and not to be seriously dwelt\nupon. No man could have less belief in star, or comet, or even sun, as\nglancing out of their proper sphere, or orbit, at the dust of earth. No\nman smiled more disdainfully at the hornbooks of seers and astrologers:\nand no man kept his own firm doubtings to himself more carefully.\n\nAnd yet he was touched, as nobody now would be in a case of that sort,\nperhaps by the real grandeur of that old man in devoting himself\n(according to his lights) to the stars that might come after him. Of\nthese the brightest now broke in; and the dreamer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peace was done for.\n\nWhat man has not his own queer little turns? Sir Roland knew quite well\nthe step at the door--for Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walk was beyond mistake; yet what\ndid he do but spread hands on his forehead, and to the utmost of all\nhis ability--sleep?\n\nHilary looked at his male parent with affectionate sagacity. He had\nsome little doubts about his being asleep, or, at any rate, quite so\nheartily as so good a man had a right to repose. Therefore, instead of\nwithdrawing, he spoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear father, I hope you are well. I am sorry to disturb you,\nbut--how do you do, sir; how do you do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe schoolboy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rude answer to this kind inquiry--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone the better for\nseeing you\u00e2\u0080\u009d--passed through Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, at least, if it did not\nenter his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. However, they saluted each other as warmly as can\nbe expected reasonably of a British father and a British son; and\nthen they gazed at one another, as if it was the first time either had\nenjoyed that privilege.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHilary, I think you are grown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland said, to break the silence,\nand save his lips from the curve of a yawn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is time for you to give\nup growing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI gave it up, sir, two years ago; if the standard measures of the\nrealm are correct. But perhaps you refer to something better than\nmaterial increase. If so, sir, I am pleased that you think so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course you are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his father answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would have grown out of\nyourself, to have grown out of pleasant self-complacency. How did you\nleave Mr. Malahide? Very well? Ah, I am glad to hear it. The law is the\nhealthiest of professions; and that your countenance vouches. But such\na colour requires food after fifty miles of travelling. We shall not\ndine for an hour and a half. Ring the bell, and I will order something\nwhile you go and see your grandmother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, thank you, sir. If you can spare the time, I should like to have a\nlittle talk with you. It is that which has brought me down from London,\nin this rather unceremonious way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpare me apologies, Hilary, because I am so used to this. It is a\ngreat pleasure to see you, of course, especially when you look so well.\nQuite as if there was no such thing as money--which happens to you\ncontinually, and is your panacea for moneyed cares. But would not the\nusual form have done--a large sheet of paper (with tenpence to pay),\nand, \u00e2\u0080\u0098My dear father, I have no ready cash--your dutiful son, H. L.\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my dear father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, laughing in recognition of his\nfavourite form; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is a much more important affair this time. Money,\nof course, I have none; but still, I look upon that as nothing. You\ncannot say I ever show any doubt as to your liberality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are quite right. I have never complained of such diffidence on\nyour part. But what is this matter far more important than money in\nyour estimate?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I scarcely seem to know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, gathering all his\ncourage, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhether there is in all the world a thing so important as\nmoney.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is quite a new view for you to take. You have thrown all your\nmoney right and left. May I hope that this view will be lasting?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I think, sir, that you may. I am about to do a thing which will\nmake money very scarce with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can think of nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his father answered, with a little impatience\nat his prologues, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich can make money any scarcer than it always is\nwith you. I know that you are honourable, and that you scorn low vices.\nWhen that has been said of you, Hilary, there is very little more to\nsay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere might have been something more to say, my dear father, but\nfor you. You have treated me always as a gentleman treats a younger\ngentleman dependent upon him--and no more. You have exchanged (as you\nare doing now) little snap-shots with me, as if I were a sharpshooter,\nand upon a level with you. I am not upon a level with you. And if it is\nkind, it is not fair play.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland looked at him with great surprise. This was not like Hilary.\nHilary, perhaps, had never been under fatherly control as he ought to\nbe; but still, he had taken things easily as yet, and held himself shy\nof conflict.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI scarcely understand you, Hilary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered, quietly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf\nyou have any grievance, surely there will be time to discuss it calmly,\nduring the long vacation, which you are now beginning so early.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear, sir, that I shall not have the pleasure of spending my long\nvacation here. I have done a thing which I am not sure that you will at\nall approve of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is to say, you are quite sure that I shall disapprove of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my dear father; I hope not quite so bad at that, at any rate. I\nshall be quite resigned to leave you to think of it at your leisure. It\nis simply this--I have made up my mind, if I can obtain your consent,\nto get married.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the father, with a smile of some contempt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will\nnot say that I am surprised; for nothing you do surprises me. But who\nhas inspired this new whim, and how long will it endure?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll my life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the youth replied, with fervour and some irritation;\nfor his father alone of living beings knew how to irritate him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll\nmy life, sir, as sure as I live! Can you never believe that I am in\nearnest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe must be a true enchantress so to have improved your character! May\nI venture to ask who she is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, sir. She lives in Kent, and her name is Mabel Lovejoy, the\ndaughter of Mr. Martin Lovejoy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLovejoy! A Danish name, I believe; and an old one, in its proper form.\nWhat is Mr. Martin Lovejoy by profession, or otherwise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy profession he is a very worthy and long-established grower.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA grower! I fail to remember that branch of the liberal professions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA grower, sir, is a gentleman who grows the fruits of the earth, for\nthe good of others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we should call a \u00e2\u0080\u0098spade husbandman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perhaps. A healthful and\nclassic industry--under the towers of \u00c5\u0092balia. I beg to be excused all\nfurther discussion; as I never use strong language. Perhaps you will go\nand enlist your grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sympathy with this loyal attachment to\nthe daughter of the grower.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, sir, if you will only allow me----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course; if I would only allow you to describe her virtues--but that\nis just what I have not the smallest intention of allowing. Spread\nthe wings of imagination to a more favourable breeze. This interview\nmust close on my part with a suggestive (but perhaps self-evident)\nproposition. Hilary, the door is open.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nTHE WELL OF THE SIBYL.\n\n\nIn the village of West Lorraine, which lies at the foot of the South\nDown ridge, there lived at this moment, and had lived for three\ngenerations of common people, an extraordinary old woman of the name\nof Nanny Stilgoe. She may have been mentioned before, because it was\nnext to impossible to keep out of her, whenever anybody whosoever\nwanted to speak of the neighbourhood. For miles and miles around she\nwas acknowledged to know everything; and the only complaint about her\nwas concerning her humility. She would not pretend to be a witch; while\neverybody felt that she ought to be, and most people were sure that she\nwas one.\n\nAlice Lorraine was well-accustomed to have many talks with Nanny;\nlistening to her queer old sayings, and with young eyes gazing at the\nwisdom or folly of the bygone days. Nanny, of course, was pleased with\nthis; still she was too old to make a favourite now of any one. People\ngoing slowly upward towards a better region have a vested interest\nstill in earth, but in mankind a mere shifting remainder.\n\nTherefore all the grace of Alice and her clever ways and sweetness, and\neven half a pound of tea and an ounce and a half of tobacco, could not\ntempt old Nanny Stilgoe to say what was not inside of her. Everybody\nmade her much more positive in everything (according as the months\nwent on, and she knew less and less what became of them) by calling\nupon her, at every new moon, to declare to them something or other. It\nwas not in her nature to pretend to deceive anybody, and she found it\nharder, from day to day, to be right in all their trifles.\n\nBut her best exertions were always forthcoming on behalf of Coombe\nLorraine, both as containing the most conspicuous people of the\nneighbourhood, and also because in her early days she had been a trusty\nservant under Lady Valeria. Old Nanny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age had become by this time\nalmost an unknown quantity, several years being placed to her credit\n(as is almost always done), to which she was not entitled. But, at\nany rate, she looked back upon her former mistress, Lady Valeria, as\ncomparatively a chicken, and felt some contempt for her judgment,\nbecause it could not have grown ripe as yet. Therefore the venerable\nMrs. Stilgoe (proclaimed by the public voice as having long since\ncompleted her century) cannot have been much under ninety in the year\nof grace 1811.\n\nBeing of a rather stiff and decided--not to say crabbed--turn of mind,\nthis old woman kept a small cottage to herself at the bend of the road\nbeyond the blacksmith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, close to the well of St. Hagydor. This cottage\nwas not only free of rent, but her own for the term of her natural\nlife, by deed of gift from Sir Roger Lorraine, in gratitude for a\nbrave thing she had done when Roland was a baby. Having received this\ndesirable cottage, and finding it followed by no others, she naturally\nfelt that she had not been treated altogether well by the family. And\nher pension of three half-crowns a-week, and her Sunday dinner in a\nbasin, made an old woman of her before her time, and only set people\ntalking.\n\nIn spite of all this, Nanny was full of goodwill to the family,\nforgiving them all their kindness to her, and even her own dependence\nupon them; foretelling their troubles plentifully, and never failing\nto enhance them. And now on the very day after young Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conflict\nwith his father, she had the good luck to meet Alice Lorraine, on her\nway to the rectory, to consult Uncle Struan, or beg him to intercede.\nFor the young man had taken his father at his word, concluding that the\ndoor, not only of the room, but also of the house, was open for him,\nin the inhospitable sense; and, casting off his native dust from his\ngaiters, he had taken the evening stage to London, after a talk with\nhis favourite Alice.\n\nOld Nanny Stilgoe had just been out to gather a few sticks to boil\nher kettle, and was hobbling home with the fagot in one hand, and in\nthe other a stout staff chosen from it, which she had taken to help\nher along. She wore no bonnet or cap on her head, but an old red\nkerchief tied round it, from which a scanty iron-grey lock escaped, and\nfluttered now and then across the rugged features and haggard cheeks.\nHer eyes, though sunken, were bright and keen, and few girls in the\nparish could thread a fine needle as quickly as she could. But extreme\nold age was shown in the countless seams and puckers of her face, in\nthe knobby protuberance where bones met, and, above all, in the dull\nwan surface of skin whence the life was retiring.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Nanny, I hope you are well to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alice said, kindly, though by\nno means eager to hold discourse with her just now; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are working\nhard, I see, as usual.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, working hard, the same as us all be born to, and goes out of\nthe world with the sweat of our brow. Not the likes of you, Miss Alice.\nAll the world be made to fit you, the same as a pudding do to a basin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Nanny, you ought to know better than that. There is nobody born\nto such luck, and to keep it. Shall I carry your fagot for you? How\ncleverly you do tie them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ee may carr the fagot as far as \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee wool. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ee wunt goo very far,\nI count. The skin of thee isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thick enow. There, set \u00e2\u0080\u0099un down now\nbeside of the well. What be all this news about Haylery?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNews about Hilary, Nanny Stilgoe! Why, who has told you anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many a thing as comes to my knowledge without no need of\ntelling. He have broken with his father, haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he? Ho, ho, ho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNanny, you never should talk like that. As if you thought it a very\nfine thing, after all you have had to do with us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd all I owes you! Oh yes, yes; no need to be bringing it to my mind,\nwhen I gets it in a basin every Sunday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Mrs. Stilgoe, you must remember that it was your own wish to have\nit so. You complained that the gravy was gone into grease, and did we\nexpect you to have a great fire, and you came up and chose a brown\nbasin yourself, and the cloth it was to be tied in; and you said that\nthen you would be satisfied.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, you know it all by heart. I never pays heed to them little\nthings. I leaves all of that for the great folk. Howsever, I have a\ngood right to be told what doth not consarn no strangers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou said that you knew it all without telling! The story, however, is\ntoo true this time. But I hope it may be for a short time only.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll along of a chield of a girl--warn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it all along of that? Boys\nthinks they be sugar-plums always, till they knows \u00e2\u0080\u0099en better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Nanny, now, how rude you are! What am I but a child of a girl?\nMuch better, I hope, than a sugar-plum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me! Now, you see the water in that well. Clear and bright,\nand not so deep as this here stick of mine is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeautifully cool and sparkling even after the long hot weather. How I\nwish we had such a well on the hill! What a comfort it must be to you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHoly water, they calls it, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0099em? Holy water, tino! But it do well\nenough to boil the kittle, when there be no frogs in it. My father\ntold me that his grandfather, or one of his forebears afore him, seed\nthis well in the middle of a great roaring torrent, ten feet over top\nof this here top step. It came all the way from your hill, he said. It\nfetched more water than Adur river; and the track of it can be followed\nnow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Alice, with a little shiver of\nsuperstition; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have always longed to know more about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe less you knows of it the better for \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee. Pray to the Lord every\nnight, young woman, that you may never see it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that is all superstition, Nanny. I should like to see it\nparticularly. I never could understand how it came; though it seems\nto be clear that it does come. It has only come twice in five hundred\nyears, according to what they say of it. I have heard the old rhyme\nabout it ever--oh, ever since I can remember.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo have I heered. But they never gets things right now; they be so\ncareless. How have you heered of it, Miss Alice?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike this--as near as I can remember:--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098When the Woeburn brake the plain,\n    Ill it boded for Lorraine.\n    When the Woeburn came again,\n    Death and dearth it brought Lorraine.\n    If it ever floweth more,\n    Reign of the Lorraines is o\u00e2\u0080\u0099er.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDid I say it right now, Nanny?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, child, near enough, leastways. But you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t said the last\nverse at all.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Only this can save Lorraine,\n    One must plunge to rescue twain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I never heard those two lines, Nanny?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike enough. They never cares to finish anything nowadays. But that\nthere verse belongeth to it, as sure as any of the Psalms of David.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heerd my father say it scores of times, and he had it from his\ngrandfather. Sit you down on the stone, child, a minute, while I go in\nand start the fire up. Scarcely a bit of wood fit to burn round any of\nthe hedges now, they thieving children goes everywhere. Makes my poor\nback stiff, it doth, to get enow to boil a cow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot or a rind of\nbakkon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Nanny had her own good reasons for not wanting Alice in her cottage\njust then. Because she was going to have for dinner a rind of bacon\ntruly, but also as companion thereto a nice young rabbit with onion\nsauce; a rabbit, fee-simple whereof was legally vested in Sir Roland\nLorraine. But Bottler, the pigman, took seizin thereof, _vi et armis_,\nand conveyed it _habendum, coquendum, et vorandum_, to Mrs. Nanny\nStilgoe, in payment for a pig-charm.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice thought sadly over the many uncomfortable legends\nconcerning her ancient and dwindled race. The first outbreak of the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWoeburn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the time of Edward the Third, A.D. 1349, was said to\nhave brought forth deadly poison from the hill-side whence it sprang.\nIt ran for seven months, according to the story to be found in one of\ntheir earliest records, confirmed by an inscription in the church;\nand the Earl of Lorraine and his seven children died of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack\ndeath\u00e2\u0080\u009d within that time. Only a posthumous son was left, to carry on\nthe lineage. The fatal water then subsided for a hundred and eleven\nyears; when it broke forth suddenly in greater volume, and ran for\nthree months only. But in that short time the fortune of the family\nfell from its loftiest to its lowest; and never thenceforth was it\nrestored to the ancient eminence and wealth. On Towton field, in as\nbloody a battle as ever was fought in England, the Lorraines, though\naccustomed to driving snow, perished like a snow-drift. The bill of\nattainder, passed with hot speed by a slavish Parliament, took away\nfamily rank and lands, and left the last of them an outcast, with the\nblock prepared for him.\n\nNanny having set that coney boiling, and carefully latched the door,\nhobbled at her best pace back to Alice, and resumed her subject.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHoly water! Oh, ho, ho! Holy to old Nick, I reckon; and that be why\nher boileth over so. Three wells there be in a row, you know, Miss, all\nfrom that same spring I count; the well in Parson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garden, and this,\nand the uppest one, under the foot of your hill, above where that gipsy\nboy harboureth. That be where the Woeburn breaketh ground.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean where the moss, and the cotton-grass is. But you can scarcely\ncall it a well there now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt dothn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run much, very like; and I ha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been up that way for\na year or more. But only you try to walk over it, child; and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nwalk into your grave, I hold. The time is nigh up for it to come out,\naccording to what they tells of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, Nanny, let it come out. What a treat it would be this hot\nsummer! The Adur is almost dry, and the shepherd-pits everywhere are\nempty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you pay no heed, child, what is to come of it, if it ever comes\nout again. Worse than ever comed afore to such a lot as you be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot well see how it could be worse than death, and dearth, and\nslaughter, Nanny.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, that shows how young girls will talk, without any thought of\nanything. To us poor folk it be wise and right to put life afore\nanything, according to natur\u00e2\u0080\u0099; and arter that, the things as must go\ninside of us. There let me think, let me think a bit. I forgets things\nnow; but I know there be some\u00e2\u0080\u0099at as you great folks count more than\nlife, and victuals, and natur\u00e2\u0080\u0099, and everythin\u00e2\u0080\u0099. But I forgets the word\nyou uses for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHonour, Nanny, I suppose you mean--the honour, of course, of the\nfamily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay be, some\u00e2\u0080\u0099at of that sort, as you builds up your mind upon. Well,\nthat be running into danger now, if the old words has any truth in \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNonsense, Nanny, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not listen to you. Which of us is likely to\ndisgrace our name, pray? I am tired of all these nursery stories.\nGood-bye, Mrs. Stilgoe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not be you, at any rate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old woman muttered wrathfully,\nas Alice, with sparkling eyes, and a quick firm step, set off for the\nrectory: \u00e2\u0080\u009cif ever there was a proud piece of goods--even my \u00e2\u0080\u0099bacco\nher\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never think of in her tantrums now! Ah, well! ah, well! We\nlives, and we learns to hold our tongues in the end, no doubt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nold lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s judgment of the world was a little too harsh in this case,\nhowever; for Alice Lorraine, on her homeward way, left the usual\nshilling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-worth of tobacco on old Nanny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window-sill.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nAN OPPORTUNE ENVOY.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is worse than useless to talk any more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland said to Mr.\nHales, who by entreaty of Alice had come to dine there that day, and to\nsoften things: \u00e2\u0080\u009cStruan, you know that I have not one atom of obstinacy\nabout me. I often doubt what is right, and wonder at people who are so\npositive. In this case there is no room for doubt. Were you pleased\nwith your badger yesterday?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA capital brock, a most wonderful brock! His teeth were like a\nrat-trap. Fox, however, was too much for him. The dear little dog, how\nhe did go in! I gave the ten guineas to my three girls. Good girls,\nthoroughly good girls all. They never fall in love with anybody. And\nwhen have they had a new dress--although they are getting now quite old\nenough?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never notice those things much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland (who had given them many\ndresses) answered, most inhumanly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut they always look very good and\npretty. Struan, let us drink their healths, and happy wedlock to them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe rector looked at Sir Roland with a surprise of geniality. His\ncustom was always to help himself; while his host enjoyed by proxy.\nThis went against his fine feelings sadly. Still it was better to have\nto help himself, than be unhelped altogether.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut about that young fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Hales continued, after the toast had\nbeen duly honoured; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is possible to be too hard, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat sentiment is not new to me. Struan, you like a capeling with your\nport.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter than any olive always. And now there are no olives to be had.\nWars everywhere, wars universal! The powers of hell gat hold of me.\nAntichrist in triumph roaring! Bloodshed weltering everywhere! And I am\ntoo old myself; and I have no son to--too fight for Old England.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA melancholy thought, but you were always pugnacious, Struan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Roland, Roland, you know me better. \u00e2\u0080\u0098To seek peace and to ensue\nit,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is my text and my tactic everywhere. And with them that be of\none household, what saith St. Paul the apostle in his Epistle to the\nEphesians? You think that I know no theology, Roland, because I can sit\na horse and shoot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, nay, Struan, be not thus hurt by imaginary lesions. The great\nrange of your powers is well known to me, as it is to every one.\nParticularly to that boy whom you shot in the hedge last season.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo more of that, an you love me. I believe the little rascal peppered\nhimself to get a guinea out of me. But as to Hilary, will you allow me\nto say a few words without any offence? I am his own mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother,\nas you seem very often to forget, and I cannot bear to see a fine young\nfellow condemned and turned out of house and home for what any young\nfellow is sure to do. Boys are sure to go falling in love until their\nwhiskers are fully grown. And the very way to turn fools into heroes\n(in their own opinion) is to be violent with them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps those truths are not new to me. But I was not violent--I never\nam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt any rate you were harsh and stern. And who are you to find fault\nwith him? I care not if I offend you, Roland, until your better sense\nreturns. But did you marry exactly in your own rank of life, yourself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI married a lady, Struan Hales--your sister--unless I am misinformed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, to be sure! I know well enough what you mean by that;\nthough you have the most infernal way of keeping your temper, and\nhinting things. What you mean is that I am making little of my own\nsister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memory, by saying that she was not your equal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI meant nothing of the sort. How very hot your temper is! I showed my\nrespect for your family, Struan, and simply implied that it was not\ngraceful, at any rate, on your part----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGraceful, be hanged! Sir Roland, I cannot express myself as you\ncan--and perhaps I ought to thank God for that--but none the less for\nall that, I know when I am in the right. I feel when I am in the right,\nsir, and I snap my fingers at every one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is right. You have an unequalled power of explosion in your\nthumb-joint--I heard it through three oaken doors the last time you\nwere at all in a passion; and now it will go through a wall at least.\nNature has granted you this power to exhibit your contempt of wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, I have no power at all. I do not pretend to be clever at\nwords; and I know that you laugh at my preaching. I am but a peg in a\nhole, I know, compared with all your learning; though my churchwarden,\nGates, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear of it. What did he say last Sunday?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething very good, of course. Help yourself, Struan, and out with\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it was nothing very wonderful. And as he holds under you, Sir\nRoland----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not turn him out, for even the most brilliant flash of his\nbramble-hook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou never turn anybody out. I wish to goodness you would sometimes.\nYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about your rents. But I do care about my tithes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is deeply disappointing, after the wit you were laden with. What\nwas the epigram of Churchwarden Gates?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever you mind. That will keep--like some of your own mysteries. You\nwant to know everything and tell nothing, as the old fox did in the\nfable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is an ancient aphorism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered, gently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\nknowledge is tenfold better than speech. Let us endeavour to know\nthings, Struan, and to satisfy ourselves with knowledge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, let us know things, Roland. But you never want us to know\nanything. That is just the point, you see. Now as sure as I hold this\nglass in my hand, you will grieve for what you are doing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am doing nothing, Struan; only wondering at your excitement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoing nothing! Do you call it nothing to drive your only son from your\ndoors, and to exasperate your brother-in-law until he blames the Lord\nfor being the incumbent instead of a curate, to swear more freely?\nThere, there! I will say no more. None but my own people ever seem to\nknow what is inside of me. No more wine, Sir Roland, thank you. Not so\nmuch as a single drop more. I will go, while there is good light down\nthe hill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will do nothing of the kind, Struan Hales,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his host replied, in\nthat clear voice which is so certain to have its own clear way; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nwill sit down and take another glass of port, and talk with me in a\nfriendly manner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, anything to please you. You are marvellous hard to please\nof late.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will find me most easy to please, if only (without any further\nreproaches, or hinting at things which cannot concern you) you will\nfavour me with your calm opinion in this foolish affair of poor Hilary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whole thing is one. You so limit me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the parson, delighted\nto give advice, but loth to be too cheap with it; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must perceive,\nRoland, that all this matter is bound up, so to speak, altogether. You\nshake your head? Well, then, let us suppose that poor Hilary stands on\nhis own floor only. Every tub on its own bottom. Then what I should\ndo about him would be this: I would not write him a single line, but\nlet him abide in his breaches or breeches--whichever the true version\nis--and there he will soon have no halfpence to rattle, and therefore\nmust grow penitent. Meanwhile I should send into Kent an envoy, a man\nof penetration, to see what manner of people it is that he is so taken\nup with. And according to his report I should act. And thus we might\nvery soon break it off; without any action for damages. You know what\nthose blessed attorneys are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland thought for a little while; and then he answered pleasantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStruan, your advice is good. I had thought of that course before you\ncame. The stupid boy soon will be brought to reason; because he is\nfrightened of credit now; he was so singed at Oxford. And I can trust\nhim to do nothing dishonourable, or cold-blooded. But the difficulty of\nthe whole plan is this. Whom have I that I can trust to go into Kent,\nand give a fair report about this mercenary Grower, and his crafty\ndaughter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCould you trust me, Roland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I could. But, Struan, you never would do such a thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not? I should like to know, why not? I could get to the place in\ntwo days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time; and the change would do me a world of good. You laity\ncan never understand what it is to be a parson. A deacon would come for\na guinea, and take my Sunday morning duty, and the congregation for the\nafternoon would rejoice to be disappointed. And when I come back, they\nwill dwell on my words, because the other man will have preached so\nmuch worse. Times are hard with me, Roland, just now. If I go, will you\npay the piper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot only that, Struan; but I shall thank you to the uttermost stretch\nof gratitude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be no gratitude on either side. I am bound to look after my\nnephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affairs: and I sadly want to get away from home. I have heard\nthat there is a nice trout stream there. If Hilary, who knows all he\nknows from me, could catch a fine fish, as Alice told me,--what am I\nlikely to do, after panting up in this red-hot chalk so long? Roland,\nI must have a pipe, though you hate it. I let you sneeze; and you must\nlet me blow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Struan, you can do what you like, for this once. This is so very\nkind of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe if you had let that boy Hilary smoke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector,\nwarming unto his pipe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou never would have had all this bother with\nhim about this trumpery love-affair. Cupid hates tobacco.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nA GOOD PARSON\u00e2\u0080\u0099S HOLIDAY.\n\n\nOn the second evening after the above discourse, a solitary horseman\nmight have been seen (or, to put it more indicatively, a lonely ponyman\nwas seen) pricking gallantly over the plains, and into the good town\nof Tonbridge, in the land of Kent. Behind him, and strapped to his\nsaddle, he bore what used to be called a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvady;\u00e2\u0080\u009d that is to say, a\nsmall leather cylinder, containing change of raiment, and other small\ncomforts of the traveller. The pony he bestrode was black, with a white\nstar on her forehead, a sturdy trudger, of a spirited nature, and\nproud of the name of \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaggie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She had now recovered entirely from her\nten-guinea feast of dahlias, and was as pleased as the Rector himself,\nto whisk her tail in a change of air. Her pace was quite brisk, and\nher ears well pricked, especially when she smelled the smell which\nall country towns have of horses, and of rubbing down, hissing, and\nbucketing, and (best of all) of good oats jumping in a sieve among the\nchaff.\n\nMaggie was proud of her master, and thought him the noblest man that\never cracked a whip, having imbibed this opinion from the young smart\nhunter, who was up to everything. And it might have fared ill with Jack\nthe donkey, if Maggie had carried her master when that vile assault was\nperpetrated. But if Maggie was now in good spirits, what lofty flight\nof words can rise to the elation of her rider?\n\nThe Rector now, week after week, had been longing for a bit of sport.\nHis open and jovial nature had been shut up, pinched, and almost\npoisoned for want of proper outlet. He hated books, and he hated a\npen, and he hated doing nothing; and he never would have horse-whipped\nBonny, if he had been as he ought to be. Moreover, he had been greatly\nbothered, although he could not clearly put it, by all these reports\nabout Coombe Lorraine, and Sir Roland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manner of scorning them.\n\nBut now here he was, in a wayfaring dress, free from the knowledge of\nany one, able to turn to the right or the left, as either side might\npredominate; with a bagful of guineas to spend as his own, and yet feel\nno remorse about them. Tush! that does not express it at all. With a\nbagful of guineas to spend as he chose, and rejoice in the knowledge\nthat he was spending another man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s money, for his own good, and the\nbenefit of humanity. This is a fine feeling, and a rare one to get the\nluck of. Therefore, whosoever gets it, let him lift up his heart, and\nbe joyful.\n\nWhether from that fine diffidence, which so surely accompanies merit,\nor from honourable economy in the distribution of trust-funds, or\nfrom whatever other cause it was,--in the face of all the town of\nTonbridge, this desirable traveller turned his pony into the quiet\nyard of the old-fashioned inn, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Chequers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All the other ostlers\ngrunted disapprobation, and chewed straws; while the one ostler of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nChequers\u00e2\u0080\u009d rattled his pail with a swing of his elbow, hissed in the\nmost enticing attitude, and made believe to expect it.\n\nMr. Hales, in the manner of a cattle-jobber (which was his presentment\nnow), lifted his right leg over the mane of the pony, and so came\ndownward. Everybody in the yard at once knew thoroughly well what his\nbusiness was. And nobody attempted to cheat him in the inn; because\nit is known to be a hopeless thing to cheat a cattle-jobber, in any\nother way than by gambling. So that with little to say, or be said,\nthis unclerkly clerk had a good supper, and smoked a wise pipe with his\nlandlord.\n\nOf course he made earnest inquiries about all the farmers of the\nneighbourhood, and led the conversation gently to the Grower and his\naffairs; and as this chanced to be Master Lovejoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own \u00e2\u0080\u009chouse of call\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nat Tonbridge, the landlord gave him the highest character, and even the\ntitle of \u00e2\u0080\u009cEsquire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, with his rummer in one hand, and waving his\npipe with the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere be few in these here parts to compare\nwith Squire Lovejoy. One of the true old Kentish stock, sir; none of\nyour come-and-go bagmen. I have heered say that that land have been a\nthousand year in the family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord bless me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mr. Hales; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, we get back to the time of the\nDanes and Saxons!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the landlord, giving him a poke of admiration with\nhis pipe; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou knows all about it, as well as if I had told \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee. And\nhis family brought up so respectable! None of your sitting on pillions.\nA horse for his self, and a horse for his son, and a horse for his\npretty darter. Ah, if I were a young man again--but there, she be above\nme altogether! Though \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Chequers,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to my thinking, is more to the\npurpose, than a bigger inn might be, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his guest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow far may it be to\nOld Applewood farm?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir, how far? Why, let me see: a matter of about five mile,\nperhaps. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heered tell of the Garden of Eden, perhaps?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I read about it\u00e2\u0080\u009d--he was going to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery\nSunday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but stopped, in time to dissemble the parson.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the finest ten mile of turnpike in England. You turns off from it,\nabout four mile out. And then you keeps on straight forrard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, my good friend. I shall ask the way to-morrow. Your\nexcellent punch is as good as a nightcap. But I want to combine a\nlittle pleasure with business, if I can, to-morrow. I am a bit of a\nsportsman, in a small way. Would Mr. Lovejoy allow me to cast a fly in\nhis water, think you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, that he will, if you only tell him that you be staying at the\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Chequers Inn.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Rector went to bed that night in a placid humour, with himself, and\nhis landlord, and all the country. And sleeping well after change of\nair, a long ride, and a good supper, he awoke in the morning, as fresh\nas a lark, in a good state of mind for his breakfast.\n\nOld Applewood farm was just \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaking it easy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the betwixt and\nbetween of hard work. The berry season was over now, and the hay\nwas stacked, and the hops were dressed; John Shorne and his horses\nwere resting freely, and gathering strength for another campaign--to\ncannonade London with apples and pears. All things had the smell of\nsummer, passing rich, and the smell of autumn, without its weight\nleaning over the air. The nights were as warm as the days almost, yet\nsoft with a mellow briskness; and any young man who looked out of his\nwindow said it was a shame to go to bed. Some people have called this\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009csaddest time of the whole sad twelvemonth;\u00e2\u0080\u009d the middle or end of\nJuly, when all things droop with heavy leafiness. But who be these to\nfind fault with the richest and goodliest prime of nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength?\nPeradventure the fault is in themselves. All seasons of the year are\ngood to those who bring their seasoning.\n\nAnd now, when field, and wood, and hedge stand up in flush of\nsummering, and every bird, and bat, and insect of our British island\nis as active as he ought to be (and sometimes much too much so); also,\nwhen good people look at one another in hot weather, and feel that\nthey may have worked too hard, or been too snappish when the frosts\nwere on (which they always are, except in July), and then begin to\nwonder whether their children would like to play with the children of\none another, because they cannot catch cold in such weather; and after\nthat, begin to speak of a rubber in the bower, and a great spread of\ndelightfulness,--when all this comes to pass, what right have we to\nmake the worst of it?\n\nThat is neither here nor there. Only one thing is certain, that our\ngood parson, looking as unlike a parson as he could--and he had a good\ndeal of capacity in that way--steered his pony Maggie round the corner\ninto the Grower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yard, and looked about to see how the land lay. The\nappearance of everything pleased him well; for comfort, simplicity,\nand hospitality shared the good quarters between them. Even a captious\nman could hardly, if he understood the matter, find much fault with\nanything. The parson was not a captious man, and he knew what a good\nfarm-yard should be, and so he said \u00e2\u0080\u009cCapital, capital!\u00e2\u0080\u009d twice, before\nhe handed Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bridle to Paddy from Cork, who of course had run out\nwith a sanguine sense of a shilling arrived.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs Squire Lovejoy at home?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the visitor, being determined to\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cspake the biggest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Paddy described it afterwards. For the moment,\nhowever, he only stared, while the parson repeated the question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it the maisther ye mane?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Paddy; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfaix then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go, and ax\nthe missus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut before there was time to do this, the Grower appeared with a spud\non his shoulder. He had been in the hop-ground; and hearing a horse,\ncame up to know what was toward. The two men looked at one another,\nwith mutual approval. The parson tall, and strong, and lusty, and\nwith that straightforward aspect which is conferred, or at least\nconfirmed, by life in the open air, field sports, good living, and\nsocial gatherings. His features, too, were clear and bold, and his jaws\njust obstinate enough to manage a parish; without that heavy squareness\nwhich sets church and parish by the ears. The Grower was of moderate\nheight, and sturdy, and thoroughly useful; his face told of many\ndealings with the world; but his eyes were frank, and his mouth was\npleasant. His custom was to let other people have their say before he\nspoke; and now he saluted Mr. Hales in silence, and waited for him to\nbegin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his visitor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will excuse my freedom in coming to\nsee you thus. I am trying this part of the country, for the first time,\nfor a holiday. And the landlord of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Chequers Inn\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at Tonbridge,\nwhere I am staying for a day or two, told me that you perhaps would\nallow me to try for a fish in your river, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn our little brook! There be none left, I think. You are kindly\nwelcome to try, sir. But I fear you will have a fool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s errand of it. We\nhave had a young gentleman from London here, a wonderful angler, sure\nenough, and I do believe he hath caught every one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir, with your kind permission, there can be no harm in trying,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid the Rector, laughing, in his sleeve, at Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crude art\ncompared with his own. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe day is not very promising, and the water of\ncourse is strange to me. But have I your leave to do my best?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, as long as you like. My ground goes as far up as there is any\nwater, and down the brook to the turnpike road. We will see to your\nnag; and if you would like a bit to eat, sir, we dine at one, and we\nsup at seven; and there be always a bit in the larder \u00e2\u0080\u0099tween whiles.\nWil\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come into house before starting?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you for the kind offer; but I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better ask you the\nway, and be off. There is just a nice little coil of cloud now; in an\nhour it may be gone; and the brook, of course, is very low and clear.\nWhatever my sport is, I shall call in and thank you, when I come back\nfor my pony. My name is Hales, sir, a clerk from Sussex; very much at\nyour service and obliged to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same to you, Master Halls; and I wish you more sport than you will\nget, sir. Your best way is over that stile; and then when you come to\nthe water, go where you will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne more question, which I always ask; what size do you allow your\nfish to be taken?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat size? Why, as big, to be sure, as ever you can catch them. The\nbigger they are, the less bones they have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith a laugh at this answer, the parson set off, with his old fly-book\nin his pocket, and a rod in his hand which he had borrowed (by grace\nof his landlord) in Tonbridge. His step was brisk, and his eyes were\nbright, and he thought much more of the sport in prospect than of the\nbusiness that brought him there.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, as he hit on the brook, where an elbow of bank\njutted over it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery fine tackle will be wanted here, and one fly is\nquite enough for it. It must be fished downward, of course, because it\ncannot be fished upward. It will take all I know to tackle them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo it did; and a great deal more than he knew. He changed his fly\nevery quarter of an hour, and he tried every dodge of experience; he\neven tried dapping with the natural fly, and then the blue-bottle and\ngrasshopper; but not a trout could he get to rise, or even to hesitate,\nor show the very least sign of temptation.\n\nSo great was his annoyance (from surety of his own skill, and vain\nreliance upon it), that after fishing for about ten hours, and catching\na new-born minnow, the Rector vehemently came to a halt, and repented\nthat he had exhausted already his whole stock of strong language. When\na good man has done this, a kind of reaction (either of the stomach or\nconscience) arises, and leads him astray from his usual sign-posts,\nwhether of speech, or deed, or thought.\n\nThe Rev. Struan Hales sate down, marvelling if he were a clumsy oaf,\nand gave Hilary no small credit for catching such deeply sagacious and\nwary trout. Then he dwelled bitterly over his fate, for having to go\nand fetch his pony, and let every yokel look into his basket and grin\nat its beautiful emptiness. Moreover, he found himself face to face\nwith starvation of the saddest kind; that which a man has challenged,\nand superciliously talked about, and then has to meet very quietly.\n\nNot to exaggerate--if that were possible--Mr. Hales found his inner\nman (thus rashly exposed to new Kentish air) \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsolutely barking at\nhim,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he strongly expressed it to his wife, as soon as he was\ntruly at home again. But here he was fifty miles from home, with not\na fishing-basket only, but a much nearer and dearer receptacle, full\nof the purest vacuity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is very sad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; and all his system\nechoed it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nNOT TO BE RESISTED.\n\n\nWhile the Rector still was sitting on the mossy hump of an apple-tree,\nweary and disconsolate, listening to the murmuring brook, with louder\nmurmurings of his own, he espied a light, well-balanced figure crossing\nthe water on a narrow plank some hundred yards up the streamway.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA pretty girl!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the parson; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure of it, by the way she\ncarries herself. Plain girls never walk like that. O that she were\ncoming to my relief! But the board looks rather dangerous. I must go\nand help her. Ah, here she comes! What a quick light foot! My stars, if\nshe hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got a basket! Nothing for me, of course. No such luck, on\nthis most luckless of all days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMeanwhile she was making the best of her way, as straight as the\nwinding stream allowed, towards this ungrateful and sceptical grumbler;\nand presently she turned full upon him, and looked at him, and he at\nher.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a lovely creature!\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Mr. Hales; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand how wonderfully her\ndress becomes her! Why, the mere sight of her hat is enough to drive\na young fellow out of his mind almost! Now I should like to make her\nacquaintance; if I were not starving so. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Acrior illum cura domat,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as\nSir Roland says.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you please, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the maiden began, with a bright and modestly\nplayful glance, \u00e2\u0080\u009care you Mr. Halls, who asked my father for leave to\nfish this morning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHales, fair mistress, is my name; a poor and unworthy clerk from\nSussex.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, Mr. Hales, you must not be angry with me for thinking that you\nmight be hungry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd--and thirsty!\u00e2\u0080\u009d gasped the Rector. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoodness me, if you only knew\nmy condition, how you would pity me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt occurred to me that you might be thirsty too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered,\nproducing from her basket, a napkin, a plate, a knife and fork, half\na loaf, and something tied up in a cloth, whose fragrance went to the\nbottom of the parson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart; and after that a stone pipkin, and a\nhalf-pint horn, and last of all a pinch of salt. All these she spread\non a natural table of grass, which her clever eyes discovered over\nagainst a mossy seat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never was so thankful in all my life--I never was; I never was. My\npretty dear, what is your name, that I may bless you every night?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name is Mabel Lovejoy, sir. And I hope that you will excuse me,\nfor having nothing better to bring than this. Most fishermen prefer\nduck, I know; but we happened only to have in the larder this half, or\nso, of a young roast goose----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA goose! An infinitely finer bird. And so much more upon it! Thank God\nit wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a duck, my dear. Half a duck would scarcely be large enough\nto set my poor mouth watering. For goodness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake, give me a drop to\ndrink! What is it--water?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir, ale; some of our own brewing. But you must please to eat a\nmouthful first. I have heard that it is bad to begin with a drink.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight speedily will I qualify,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the parson, with his mouth quite\nfull of goose; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdelicious,--most delicious! You must be the good\nSamaritan, my dear; or at any rate you ought to be his wife. Your very\nbest health, Mistress Mabel Lovejoy; may you never do a worse action\nthan you have done this day; and I never shall forget your kindness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I am so glad to see you enjoy it. But you must not talk till you\nhave eaten every mouthful. Why, you ought to be quite famishing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn that respect I fulfil my duty. Nay more, I am downright famished.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a little stuffing in here, sir; let me show you; underneath\nthe apron. I put it there myself, and so I know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat most noble, most glorious, most transcendent stuffing! Whoever\nmade that was born to benefit, retrieve, and exalt humanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must not say that, sir; because I made it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Dea certe! I recover my Latin under such enchantment. But how\ncould you have found me out? And what made you so generously think of\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir, I take the greatest interest in fishermen, because--oh,\nbecause of my brother Charlie: and one of our men passed you this\nafternoon, and he said he was sure that you had caught nothing, because\nhe heard you--he thought he heard you----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, come now, complaining mildly,--not \u00e2\u0080\u0098swearing,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098swearing.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was not going to say \u00e2\u0080\u0098swearing,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sir. What made you think of such a\nthing? I am sure you never could have done it; could you? And so when\nyou did not even come to supper, it came into my head that you must\nwant refreshment; especially if you had caught no fish to comfort you\nfor so many hours. And then I thought of a plan for that, which I would\ntell you in case I should find you unlucky enough to deserve it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am unlucky enough to deserve it thoroughly; only look here, pretty\nMistress Mabel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With these words he lifted the flap of his basket, and\nshowed its piteous emptiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWest Lorraine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWest Lorraine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d For his name and address\nwere painted on the inside wicker of the lid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I beg your pardon,\nMr. Hales: I had no right to notice it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you had. But you have no right to turn away your head so. What\nharm has West Lorraine done you, that you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even look at its\nrector?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, please not; oh, please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t! I never would have come, if I could\nhave only dreamed----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you could have dreamed what? Pretty Mistress Mabel, a parson has a\nright to an explanation, when he makes a young lady blush so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it was so cruel of you! You said you were a clerk, of the name of\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Halls!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I am, a clerk in holy orders; but not of the name of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Halls.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 That\nwas your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mistake. I gave my true name; and here you see me\nvery much at your service, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am. The uncle of a fine young fellow,\nwhose name you never heard, I daresay. Have you ever happened to hear\nof a youth called Hilary Lorraine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, now I know why you are come! Oh dear! It was not for the fishing,\nafter all! And perhaps you never fished before. And everything must be\ngoing wrong. And you are come to tell me what they think of me. And\nvery likely you would be glad if you could put me in prison!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat would be nice gratitude; would it not? You are wrong in almost\nevery point. It happens that I have fished before; and that I did come\nfor the fishing partly. It happens that nothing is going wrong; and I\nam not come to say what they think of you; but to see what I think of\nyou--which is a very different thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what do you think of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mabel, casting down her eyes,\nstanding saucily, and yet with such a demure expression, that his first\nimpulse was to kiss her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that you are rogue enough to turn the head of anybody. And I\nthink that you are good enough to make him happy ever afterwards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not at all sure of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, raising her sweet eyes,\nand openly blushing; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only know that I would try. But every one is\nnot like a clergyman, to understand good stuffing. But if I had only\nknown who you were, I would never have brought you any dinner, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a disloyal thing to say! Please to tell me why I ought to starve,\nfor being Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause you would think that I wanted to coax you to--to be on my\nside, at least.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo make a goose of me, with your goose! Well, you have me at your\nmercy, Mabel. I shall congratulate Hilary on having won the heart of\nthe loveliest, best, and cleverest girl in the county of Kent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, sir, you must not say that, because I am nothing of the sort;\nand you must not laugh at me, like that. And how do you know that he\nhas done it? And what will every one say, when they hear that he--that\nhe would like to marry the daughter of a Grower?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does his father say? That is the point. It matters very little\nwhat others say. And I will not conceal from you, pretty Mabel, that\nhis father is bitterly set against it, and turned him out of doors,\nwhen he heard of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that is why he has never written. He did not know how to break it\nto me. I was sure there was something bad. But of course I could expect\nnothing else. Poor, poor sillies, both of us! I must give him up, I see\nI must. I felt all along that I should have to do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cry so; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cry, my dear, like that. There is plenty of time\nto talk of it. Things will come right in the end, no doubt. But what\ndoes your father say to it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI scarcely know whether he knows it yet. Hilary wanted to tell him;\nbut I persuaded him to leave it altogether to me. And so I told my\nmother first; and she thought we had better not disturb my father about\nit, until we heard from Hilary. But I am almost sure sometimes that he\nknows it, and is not at all pleased about it; for he looks at me very\nstrangely. He is the best and kindest man living, almost; but he has\nvery odd ways sometimes; and it is most difficult to turn him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo it is with most men who are worth their salt. I despise a\nweathercock. Would you like me to come in and see him; or shall I fish\na little more first? I am quite a new man since you fed me so well; and\nI scarcely can put up with this disgrace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you would like to fish a little longer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mabel, following the\nloving gaze, which (with true angling obstinacy) lingered still on the\ncoy fair stream, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is plenty of time to spare. My father rode\noff to Maidstone, as soon as he found that you were not coming in to\nsupper; and he will not be back till it is quite dark. And I should\nhave time for a talk with my mother, while you are attempting to catch\na trout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Mabel, Mabel, you are too disdainful. Because I am not my own\nnephew (who learned what little he knows altogether from me), and\nbecause I have been so unsuccessful, you think that I know nothing;\nwomen always judge by the event, having taken the trick from their\nfathers perhaps. But you were going to tell me something, to make up\nfor my want of skill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; but you must promise not to tell any one else, upon any account.\nMy brother Charlie found it out; and I have not told even Hilary of it,\nbecause he could catch fish without it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou most insulting of all pretty maidens; if you despise my science\nthus, I will tell Sir Roland that you are vain and haughty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery ill-tempered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, now, you never could say that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClumsy, ill-dressed, and slatternly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell done, well done, Mr. Hales!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, and fearfully ugly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha! I have taken your breath away with absolute amazement. I wish\nHilary could see you now; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d steal something very delightful, and\nthen knock his excellent uncle down. But now, make it up like a dear\ngood girl; and tell me this great secret.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the simplest thing in the world. You just take a little bit of\nthis--see here, I have some in my basket; and cut a little delicate\nstrip, and whip it on the lower part of your fly. I have done it for\nCharlie many a time. I will do one for you, if you like, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well. I will try it, to please you; and for the sake of an\nexperiment. Good-bye, good-bye till dark, my dear. We shall see whether\na clerk can catch fish or no.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Mr. Hales returned at night to the hospitable old farm-house, he\ncarried on his ample back between two and three dozen goodly trout;\nfor many of which he confessed himself indebted to Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clever\nfingers. Mrs. Lovejoy had been prepared by her daughter to receive him;\nbut the Grower was not yet come home from Maidstone; which, on the\nwhole, was a fortunate thing. For thus the Rector had time enough to\nsettle with his hostess what should be done on his part and on hers,\ntowards the removal, or at any rate the gradual reduction, of the many\nstumbling-blocks that lay, as usual, upon true love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s course. For both\nforesaw that if the franklin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pride should once be wounded, he would\nbe certain to bar the way more sternly than even the baronet himself.\nAnd even without that, he could hardly be expected to forego, all in\na moment, his favourite scheme above described, that Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s husband\nshould carry on the ancestral farm, and the growth of fruit. In his\nblunt old fashion, he cared very little for baronets, or for Norman\nblood; and like a son of Tuscan soil, was well content to lead his life\nin cleaving paternal fields with the hoe, and nourishing household\ngods, and hearth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nABSURD SURDS.\n\n\nIt is a fine thing to have quarters in an English country-town, where\nnobody knows who the sojourner is, and nobody cares who he may be. To\nbegin (at gentle leisure) to feel interest in the place, and quicken\nup to the vein of humour throbbing through the High Street. The third\nevening cannot go over one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head without a general sense being gained\nof the politics of the town, and, far more important--the politicians;\nand if there only is a corporation, wisdom cries in the streets, and\nnobody can get on with anybody. However, when the fights are over,\ngenerally speaking, all cool down.\n\nBut this is about the last thing that a stranger should exert his\nintellect to understand. It would be pure waste of time; unless he\nmeans to buy a house and settle down, and try to be an alderman in\ntwo years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time, and mount ambition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ladder even to the giddy height\nof mayoralty; till the hand of death comes between the rungs and\nvertically drags him downward. And even then, for three months shall he\nbe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cour deeply lamented townsman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut if this visitor firmly declines (as, for his health, he is bound\nto do) these mighty combats, which always have the eyes of the nation\nfixed on them--if he is satisfied to lounge about, and say \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\nmorning\u00e2\u0080\u009d here and there, to ascertain public sentiment concerning\nthe state of the weather, and to lay out sixpence judiciously in\ncultivating good society--then speedily will he get draughts of\nknowledge enough to quench the most ardent thirst; while the yawn of\nindolence merges in the quickening smile of interest. Then shall he get\nan insight into the commerce, fashion, religious feeling, jealousies,\nand literature of the town, its just and pleasant self-esteem, its\ntolerance and intolerance (often equally inexplicable), its quiet\nenjoyments, and, best of all, its elegant flirtations.\n\nThese things enabled Mr. Hales to pass an agreeable week at Tonbridge,\nand to form acquaintance with some of its leading inhabitants; which in\npursuit of his object he was resolved, as far as he could, to do. And\nfrom all of these he obtained very excellent tidings of the Lovejoys,\nas being a quiet, well-conducted, and highly respectable family,\nadmitted (whenever they cared to be so) to the best society of the\nneighbourhood, and forgiven for growing cherries, and even for keeping\na three-horsed van.\n\nAlso, as regarded his own impressions, the more he saw of Old Applewood\nfarm, the more he was pleased with it and with its owners; and calling\nupon his brother parson, the incumbent of the parish, he found in\nhim a congenial soul, who wanted to get a service out of him. For\nthis Mr. Hales was too wide awake, having taken good care to leave\nsermons at home; because he had been long enough in holy orders to\nknow what delight all parsons find in spoiling one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s holidays.\nMoreover, he had promised himself the pleasure of sitting in a pew,\nfor once, repossessing the right to yawn _ad libitum_, and even fall\ninto a murmurous nap, after exhausting the sweetness of the well-known\nLucretian sentiment--to gaze in safety at another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s labours; or, as the\nnavvy more tersely put it, when asked of his _summum bonum_, to \u00e2\u0080\u009clook\non at t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other beggars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMeanwhile, however, many little things were beginning to go crosswise.\nFor instance, Hilary walked down headlong, being exceedingly short of\ncash, to comfort Mabel, and to get good quarters, and perhaps to go\non about everything. Luckily, his uncle Struan met him in the street\nof Sevenoaks (whither he had ridden for a little change), and amazed\nhim with very strong language, and begged him not to make a confounded\nfool of himself, and so took him into a public-house. The young man, of\ncourse, was astonished to see his uncle carrying on so, dressed as a\nlayman, and roving about without any wife or family.\n\nBut when he knew for whose sake it was done, and how strongly his uncle\nwas siding with him, his gratitude and good emotions were such that he\nscarcely could finish his quart of beer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy boy, I am thoroughly ashamed of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his uncle, looking\nqueerly at him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are most immature for married life, if you give\nway to your feelings so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut uncle, when a man is down so much, and turned out of doors by his\nown father----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen a \u00e2\u0080\u0098man\u00e2\u0080\u0099! When a \u00e2\u0080\u0098boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is what you mean, I suppose. A man would\ntake it differently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure I take it very well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, trying to smile at it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, I will drink up my beer; for I know that sort of thing always\nvexes you. Now, can you say that I have kicked up a row, or done\nanything that I might have done?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my boy, no; quite the opposite thing; you have taken it most\nangelically.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAngelically, without an angelus, uncle, or even a stiver in my pocket!\nOnly the cherub aloft, you know----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anything about him; and the allusion, to my mind, is\nprofane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, uncle, you are hyperclerical, because I have caught you dressed\nas a bagman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand your big Oxford words. In my days they taught\ntheology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd hunting; come now, Uncle Struan, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they teach you hunting?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector, stroking his chin; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was a poor young man, of\ncourse, and could not afford that sort of thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, but you did, you know, Uncle Struan; I have heard you boast of it\nfifty times.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a plague you are, Hilary! There may have been times--however, you\nare going on quite as if we were sitting and having a cozy talk after\ndinner at West Lorraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to goodness we were, my dear uncle. I never shall have such a\npleasure again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear boy, my dear boy; to talk like that, at your time of life!\nWhat a thing love is, to be sure! However, in that state, a dinner is\nno matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I shall be off now for London again. A bit of bread and cheese,\nafter all, is as good as anything. Good-bye, my dear uncle, I shall\nalways thank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall thank me for two things before you start. And you should not\nstart, except that I know it to be at present best for you. You shall\nthank me for as good a dinner as can be got in a place like this; and\nafter that for five gold guineas, just to go on for a bit with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus the Rector had his way, and fed his nephew beautifully, and sent\nhim back with a better heart in his breast, to meet the future. Hilary\nof course was much aggrieved, and inclined to be outrageous, at having\nwalked four-and-twenty miles, with eager proceeding at every step, and\nthen being balked of a sight of his love. However, he saw that it was\nfor the best; and five guineas (feel as you will) are something.\n\nHis good uncle paid his fare back by the stage, and saw him go off,\nand kissed hands to him; feeling greatly relieved as soon as ever he\nwas round the corner; for he must have spoiled everything at the farm.\nTherefore this excellent uncle returned to his snug little sanded\nparlour, to smoke a fresh pipe; and to think, in its influence, how to\nget on with these new affairs.\n\nHere were heaps of trouble rising; as peaks of volcanoes come out of\nthe sea. And who was to know how to manage things, so as to make them\nall subside again? Hilary might seem easy to deal with, so long as he\nhad no money; but even he was apt to take strange whims into his head,\nalthough he might feel that he could not pay for them. And then there\nwas the Grower, an obstinate factor in any calculation; and then the\nGrower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, who might appeal perhaps to the Attorney-General; also\nSir Roland, with his dry unaccountable manner of regarding things; and\nlast, not least, the Rector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own superior part of his household. If\nhe could not manage them, anybody at first sight would say that the\nfault must be altogether his own--that a man who cannot lay down the\nlaw to his own wife and daughters, really is no man, and deserves to be\ntreated accordingly. Yet this depends upon special gifts. The Rector\ncould carry on very well, when he understood the subject, even with his\nwife and daughters, till it came to crying. Still in the end (as he\nknew in his heart), he always got the worst of it.\n\nNow what would all these ladies say, if the incumbent of the parish,\nthe rector of the rectory, the very husband or father of all of\nthemselves--as the case might be--were to depart from his sense of\nright, and the principles he had laid down to them, to such an extent\nas to cherish Hilary in black rebellion against his own father? Suasion\nwould be lost among them. It is a thing that may be tried, under\nfavourable circumstances, as against one lady, when quite alone; but\nwith four ladies all taking different views of the matter in question,\nyet ready in a moment to combine against any form of reason,--a\nbachelor must be Quixotic, a husband and father idiotic, if he relies\nupon any other motive power than that of his legs. But the Rector was\nnot the man to run away, even from his own family. So, on the whole,\nhe resolved to let things follow their own course, until something new\nshould begin to rise. Except at least upon two little points--one, that\nHilary should be kept from visiting the farm just now; and the other,\nthat the Grower must be told of all this love-affair.\n\nMr. Hales, as an owner of daughters, felt that it was but a father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndue, to know what his favourite child was about in such important\nmatters; and he thought it the surest way to set him bitterly against\nany moderation, if he were left to find out by surprise what was going\non at his own hearth. It happened, however, that the Grower had a\nshrewd suspicion of the whole of it, and was laughing in his sleeve,\nand winking (in his own determined way) at his good wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man\u00c5\u0093uvres.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall stop it all, when I please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself, every night\nat bed-time; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet them have their little game, and make up their minds\nto astonish me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For he, like almost every man who has attained the age\nof sixty, looked back upon love as a brief excrescence, of about as\nmuch importance as a wart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, no need to tell me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, when Mrs. Lovejoy, under\nthe parson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice, and at Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entreaty, broke the matter to him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go about with my eyes shut, wife. A man that knows every pear\nthat grows, can tell the colour on a maiden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheek. I have settled to\nsend her away to-morrow to her Uncle Catherow. The old mare will be\nready at ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. I meant to leave you to guess the reason; you are\nso clever all of you. Ha, ha! you thought the old Grower was as blind\nas a bat; now, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, at any rate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mrs. Lovejoy, giving her pillow an angry\nthump, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you might have consulted me, Martin: with half her\nclothes in the wash-tub, and a frayed ribbon on her Sunday hat! Men\nare so hot and inconsiderate. All to be done in a moment, of course!\nThe least you could have done, I am sure, would have been to tell me\nbeforehand, Martin; and not to pack her off like that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure! Just as you told me, good wife, your plan for packing her\noff, for life! Now just go to sleep; and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t beat about so. When I\nsay a thing I do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nOUR LAD STEENIE.\n\n\nWhen the flaunting and the flouting of the summer-prime are over; when\nthe leaves of tree, and bush, and even of unconsidered weeds, hang on\ntheir stalks, instead of standing upright, as they used to do; and very\noften a convex surface, by the cares of life, is worn into a small\nconcavity: a gradual change, to a like effect, may be expected in the\nhuman mind.\n\nA man remembers that his own autumn is once more coming over him; that\nthe light is surely waning, and the darkness gathering in; that more of\nhis plans are shed and scattered, as the sun \u00e2\u0080\u009cdraws water\u00e2\u0080\u009d among the\nclouds, or as the gossamer floats idly over the sere and seeded grass.\nTherefore it is high time to work, to strengthen the threads of the\nwavering plan, to tighten the mesh of the woven web, to cast about here\nand there for completion--if the design shall be ever complete.\n\nSo now, as the summer passed, a certain gentleman, of more repute\nperhaps than reputation, began to be anxious about his plans.\n\nSir Remnant Chapman owned large estates adjoining the dwindled but\nstill fair acreage of the Lorraines, in the weald of Sussex. Much\nas he differed from Sir Roland in tastes and habits and character,\nhe announced himself, wherever he went, as his most intimate friend\nand ally. And certainly he was received more freely than any other\nneighbour at Coombe Lorraine, and knew all the doings and ways of the\nfamily, and was even consulted now and then. Warm friendship, however,\ncan scarcely thrive without mutual respect; and though Sir Remnant\ncould never escape from a certain unwilling respect for Sir Roland, the\nlatter never could contrive to reciprocate the feeling.\n\nBecause he knew that Sir Remnant was a gentleman of a type already even\nthen departing, although to be found, at the present day, in certain\nparts of England. A man of fixed opinions, and even what might be\naccounted principles (at any rate by himself) concerning honour, and\nbirth, and betting, and patriotism, and some other matters, included\nin a very small et-cetera. It is hard to despise a man who has so many\npoints settled in his system; but it is harder to respect him, when he\nsees all things with one little eye, and that eye a vicious one. Sir\nRemnant Chapman had no belief in the goodness of woman, or the truth of\nman--in the beautiful balance of nature, or even the fatherly kindness\nthat comforts us. Therefore nobody could love him; and very few people\npaid much attention to his dull hatred of mankind. \u00e2\u0080\u009cContempt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nalways called it; but he had not power to make it that; neither had he\nany depth of root, to throw up eminence. A \u00e2\u0080\u009cbitter weed\u00e2\u0080\u009d many people\ncalled him; and yet he was not altogether that. For he liked to act\nagainst his nature, perhaps from its own perversity; and often did kind\nthings, to spite his own spitefulness, by doing them. As for sense of\nright and wrong, he had none outside of his own wishes; and he always\nexpected the rest of the world to move on the same low system. How\ncould such a man get on, even for an hour, with one so different--and\nmore than that, so opposite to him--as the good Sir Roland? Mr. Hales,\nwho was not (as we know) at all a tight-laced man himself, and may\nperhaps have been a little jealous of Sir Remnant, put that question\nto himself, as well as to his wife and family; and echo only answered\n\u00e2\u0080\u009chow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, soever, there was the fact; and how many facts can we\ncall to mind ever so much stranger?\n\nSir Remnant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only son, Stephen Chapman, was now over thirty years of\nage, and everybody said that it was time for him to change his mode\nof life. Even his father admitted that he had made an unreasonably\nlong job of \u00e2\u0080\u009csowing his wild oats,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and now must take to some better\nculture. And nothing seemed more likely to lead to this desirable\nresult than a speedy engagement to an accomplished, sensible, and\nattractive girl. Therefore, after a long review and discussion of all\nthe young ladies round, it had been settled that the heir of all the\nChapmans should lay close siege to young Alice Lorraine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Chapman\u00e2\u0080\u009d--as Stephen was called by courtesy in that\nneighbourhood, having held a commission in a fashionable regiment,\nuntil it was ordered to the war--this man was better than his father\nin some ways, and much worse in others. He was better, from weakness;\nnot having the strength to work out works of iniquity; and also from\nhaving some touches of kindness, whereof his father was intact. He was\nworse, because he had no sense of honour, no rudiment of a principle;\nnot even a dubious preference for the truth, at first sight, against\na lie. Captain Chapman, however, could do one manly thing, and only\none. He could drive, having cultivated the art, in the time when it\nmeant something. Horses were broken then, not trained--as nowadays\nthey must be--and skill and nerve were needed for the management of a\nfour-in-hand. Captain Chapman was the first in those parts to drive\nlike Ericthonius, and it took him a very long time to get his father\nto sit behind him. For the roads were still very bad and perilous, and\nbetter suited for postilions, than for Stephen Chapman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team.\n\nHe durst not drive up Coombe Lorraine, or at any rate he feared the\ndescent as yet, though he meant some day to venture it. And now that\nhe was come upon his wooing, he left his gaudy equipage at the foot of\nthe hill, to be sent back to Steyning and come for him at an appointed\ntime. Then he and his father, with mutual grumblings, took to the steep\nascent on foot.\n\nSir Roland had asked them, a few days ago, to drive over and dine with\nhim, either on Thursday, or any other day that might suit them. They\ncame on the Thursday, with their minds made up to be satisfied with\nanything. But they certainly were not very well pleased to find that\nthe fair Mistress Alice had managed to give them the slip entirely. She\nwas always ready to meet Sir Remnant, and discharge the duties of a\nhostess to him; but, from some deep instinctive aversion, she could not\neven bear to sit at table with the Captain. She knew not at all what\nhis character was; neither did Sir Roland know a tenth part of his ill\nrepute; otherwise he had never allowed him to approach the maiden. He\nsimply looked upon Captain Chapman as a fashionable man of the day, who\nmight have been a little wild perhaps, but now meant to settle down in\nthe country, and attend to his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large estates.\n\nHowever, neither of the guests suspected that their visit had fixed\nthe date of another little visit pending long at Horsham; and one girl\nbeing as good as another to men of the world of that stamp, they were\nwell content, when the haunch went out, to clink a glass with the\nRector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughters, instead of receiving a distant bow from a diffident\nand very shy young lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Lorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d began Sir Remnant, after the ladies had left the\nroom, and the Captain was gone out to look at something, according to\narrangement, and had taken the Rector with him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have known one\nanother a good many years; and I want a little sensible talk with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Remnant, I hope that our talk is always sensible; so far at least\nas can be expected on my part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere you are again, Lorraine, using some back meaning, such as no one\nelse can enter into. But let that pass. It is your way. Now I want to\nsay something to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI also am smitten with a strong desire to know what it is, Sir\nRemnant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it is neither more nor less than this. You know what dangerous\ntimes we live in, with every evil power let loose, and Satan, like a\nroaring lion, rampant and triumphant. Thank you, yes, I will take a\npinch; your snuff is always so delicious. With the arch-enemy prowling\nabout, with democracy, nonconformity, infidelity, and rick-burnings----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExactly so. How well you express it! I was greatly struck with it in\nthe _George and Dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ report of your speech at the farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dinner\nat Billinghurst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, I may have said it before; but that only makes it the more\nthe truth. Can you deny it, Sir Roland Lorraine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFar be it from me to deny the truth. I am listening with the greatest\ninterest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, you are not; you never do. You are always thinking of something to\nyourself. But what I was going to say was this, that it is high time to\ncement the union, and draw close the bonds of amity between all good\nmen, all men of any principle--by which I mean--come now, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure: you mean all stanch Tories.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes; all who hold by Church and State, land and the constitution.\nI have educated my son carefully in the only right and true principles.\nTrain up a child--you know what I mean. And you, of course, have\nbrought up your daughter upon the same right system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, rather, I have left her to form her own political opinions. And,\nto the best of my belief, she has formed none.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLorraine, I am heartily glad to hear it. That is how all the girls\nshould be. When I was in London, they turned me sick with asking my\nopinion. The less they know, the better for them. Knowledge of anything\nmakes a woman scarcely fit to speak to. My poor dear wife could read\nand write, and that was quite enough for her. She did it on the\njam-pots always, and she could spell most of it. Ah, she was a most\nwonderful woman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was. I often found much pleasure in her conversation. She knew so\nmany things that never come by way of reading.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so does Stephen. You should hear him. He never reads any sort of\nbook. Ah, that is the true learning. Books always make stupid people.\nNow it struck me that--ah, you know, I see. A wink\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as good as a nod,\nof course. No catching a weasel asleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here Sir Remnant screwed up\none eye, and gave Sir Roland a poke in the ribs, with the most waggish\nair imaginable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAgain and again I assure you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his host, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I have not the\nsmallest idea what you mean. Your theory about books has in me the most\nthorough confirmation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha! it is all very well--all very well to pretend, Lorraine. Another\npinch of snuff, and that settles it. Let them set up their horses\ntogether as soon as ever they please--eh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho? What horses? Why will you thus visit me with impenetrable\nenigmas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVisit you! Why, you invited me yourself! Who indeed? Why, of course,\nour lad Steenie, and your girl Lallie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Chapman and my Alice! Such a thought never entered my mind. Do\nyou know that poor Alice is little more than seventeen years old? And\nCaptain Chapman must be--let me see----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind what he is. He is my son and heir, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be fifty\nthousand to settle on his wife, in hard cash--not so bad nowadays.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Remnant Chapman, I beg you not to say another word on the subject.\nYour son must be twice my daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age, and he looks even more than\nthat----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDash my wig! Then I am seventy, I suppose. What the dickens have his\nlooks got to do with the matter? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call him at all a bad-looking\nfellow. A chip of the old block, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what he is. Ah, many a fine\nwoman, I can tell you----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, if you please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland said, with a very clear and determined\nvoice--\u00e2\u0080\u009cif you please, we will drop this subject. Your son may be a\nvery good match, and no doubt he is in external matters; and if Alice,\nwhen old enough, should become attached to him, perhaps I might not\noppose it. There is nothing more to be said at present; and, above all\nthings, she must not hear of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see, I see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the other baronet, who was rather short of\ntemper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMissy must be kept to her bread-and-milk, and good books, and\nall that, a little longer. By the by, Lorraine, what was it I heard\nabout your son the other day--that he had been making a fool of himself\nwith some grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not heard of any grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter. And as he will shortly\nleave England, people perhaps will have less to say about him. His\ncommission is promised, as perhaps you know; and he is not likely to\nquit the army because there is fighting going on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Remnant felt all the sting of that hit; his face (which showed\nmany signs of good living) flushed to the tint of the claret in his\nhand, and he was just about to make a very coarse reply, when luckily\nthe Rector came back suddenly, followed by the valiant Captain. Sir\nRoland knew that he had allowed himself to be goaded into bad manners\nfor once, and he strove to make up for it by unwonted attention to the\nwarrior.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nIN A MARCHING REGIMENT.\n\n\nIt was true that Hilary had attained at last the great ambition of his\nlife. He had changed the pen for the sword, the sand for powder, and\nthe ink for blood; and in a few days he would be afloat, on his way to\njoin Lord Wellington. His father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obstinate objections had at last\nbeen overcome; for there seemed to be no other way to cut the soft net\nof enchantment and throw him into a sterner world.\n\nHis Uncle Struan had done his best, and tried to the utmost stretch\nthe patience of Sir Roland, with countless words, until the latter\nexclaimed at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you seem to be worse than the boy himself!\nYou went to spy out the nakedness of the land, and you returned in a\nfortnight with grapes of Eschol. Truly this Danish Lovejoy is more\npotent than the great Canute. He turns at his pleasure the tide of\nopinion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoland, now you go too far. It is not the Grower that I indite of,\nbut his charming daughter. If you could but once be persuaded to see\nher----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course. Exactly what Hilary said. In him I could laugh at it; but\nin you---- Well, a great philosopher tells us that every jot of opinion\n(even that of a babe, I suppose) is to be regarded as an equal item\nof the \u00e2\u0080\u0098universal consensus.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And the universal consensus becomes,\nor forms, or fructifies, or solidifies, into the great homogeneous\ntruth. I may not quote him aright, and I beg his pardon for so lamely\nrendering him. However, that is a rude sketch of his view, a brick\nfrom his house--to mix metaphors--and perhaps you remember it better,\nStruan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid! The only thing that I remember out of all my education is\nthe stories--what do you call them?--mythologies. Capital some of them\nare, capital! Ah, they do so much good to boys--teach them manliness\nand self-respect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo they? However, to return to this lovely daughter of the Kentish\nAlcinous--by the way, if his ancestors were Danes who took to\ngardening, it suggests a rather startling analogy. The old Corycian is\nbelieved (though without a particle of evidence) to have been a pirate\nin early life, and therefore have taken to pot-herbs. Let that pass. I\ncould never have believed it, except for this instance of Lovejoy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how, if you please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d broke in the Rector, who was always jealous\nof \u00e2\u0080\u009cNorman blood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because he had never heard that he had any; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow\nwere the Normans less piratical, if you please, than the Danes, their\nown grandfathers? Except that they were sick at sea--big rogues all of\nthem, in my opinion. The Saxons were the only honest fellows. Ay, and\nthey would have thrashed those Normans, but for the slightest accident.\nWhen I hear of those Normans, without any shoulders--don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me;\nthey never would have built such a house as this is, otherwise--what do\nyou think I feel ready to do, sir? Why, to get up, and to lift my coat,\nand----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, Struan; we quite understand all your emotions without\nthat. This makes you a very bigoted ambassador in our case. You meant\nto bring back all the truth, of course. But when you found the fishing\ngood, and the people roughly hospitable, and above all, a Danish smack\nin their manners, and figures, and even their eyes, which have turned\non the Kentish soil, I am told, to a deep and very brilliant brown----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Roland, you are right for once. At any rate, it is so with her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well. Then you being, as you always are, a sudden man--what did\nyou do but fall in love (in an elderly fatherly manner, of course) with\nthis--what is her name, now again? I never can recollect it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do. You never forget anything. Her name is Mabel. And you may be\nglad to pronounce it pretty often, in your old age, Sir Roland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it is a pretty name, and deserves a pretty bearer. But, Struan,\nyou are a man of the world. You know what Hilary is; and you know\n(though we do not give ourselves airs, and drive four horses in a\nhideous yellow coach, and wear diamond rings worth a thousand pounds),\nyou know what the Lorraines have always been--a little particular in\ntheir ways, and a little inclined to, to, perhaps----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo look down on the rest of the world, without ever letting them know\nit, or even knowing it yourselves, perhaps. Have I hit it aright, Sir\nRoland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot quite that. Indeed, nothing could be further from what I was\nthinking of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland Lorraine sighed gently here; and even his\nbrother-in-law had not the least idea why he did so. It was that Sir\nRoland, like all the more able Lorraines for several centuries, was at\nheart a fatalist. And this family taint had perhaps been deepened by\nthe infusion of Eastern blood. This was the bar so often fixed between\nthem and the rest of the world--a barrier which must hold good, while\nevery man cares for his neighbour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul, so much more than his own for\never.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it anything in religion, Roland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Rector whispered kindly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nknow that you are not orthodox, and a good deal puffed up with carnal\nknowledge. Still, if it is in my line at all; I am not a very high\nauthority--but perhaps I might lift you over it. They are saying all\nsorts of things now in the world; and I have taken two hours a-day,\nseveral days--now you need not laugh--in a library we have got up at\nHorsham, filled with the best divinity; so as to know how to answer\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Struan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland replied, without so much as the gleam of\na smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat was really good of you. And you now have so many other\nthings to attend to with young dogs, and that; and the 1st of September\nnext week, I believe! What a relief that must be to you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, that it is. You cannot imagine, of course, with all your many ways\nof frittering time away indoors, what a wearing thing it is to have\nnothing better than rabbit-shooting, or teaching a dog to drop to shot.\nBut now about Hilary: you must relent--indeed you must, dear Roland.\nHe is living on sixpence a-day, I believe--virtuous fellow, most rare\nyoung man! Why, if that dirty Steve Chapman now had been treated as you\nhave served Hilary--note of hand, bill-drawing, post-obits,--and you\nmight even think yourself lucky if there were no big forgery to hush\nup. Ah, his father may think what he likes; but I look on Hilary as a\nperfect wonder, a Bayard, a Crichton, a pelican!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely you mean a paragon, Struan? What young can he have to feed from\nhis own breast?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI meant what I said, as I always do. And how can you know what young\nhe has, when you never even let him come near you? Ah, if I only had\nsuch a son!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here the Rector, who really did complain that he had no\nson to teach how to shoot, managed to get his eyes a little touched\nwith genial moisture.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is grievous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand a little more than I ever\nexpected, or can have enabled myself to deserve. Now, Struan, will you\ncease from wailing, if I promise one thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat must depend upon what it is. It will take a good many things, I\nam afraid, to make me think well of you again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo hear such a thing from the head of the parish! Now, Struan, be not\nvindictive. I ought to have let you get a good day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shooting, and then\nyour terms would have been easier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Roland, you know that we can do nothing. The estates are tied\nup in such a wonderful way, by some lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trick or other, through a\nwhim of that blessed old lady--she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear me, can she?--that Hilary\nhas his own sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life between him and the inheritance; so far as\nany of us can make out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo that you need not have boasted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Sir Roland, with a quiet\nsmile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout his being a Bayard, in refraining from post-obits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well; you know what I meant quite well. The Jews are not yet\nbanished from England. And there is reason to fear they never will be.\nThere are plenty of them to discount his chance, if he did what many\nother boys would do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland felt the truth of this. And he feared in his heart that he\nmight be pushing his only son a little too hard, in reliance upon his\nhonour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you come to the point for once?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, with a look of\ndespair and a voice of the same. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is my offer--to get Hilary a\ncommission in a foot-regiment, pack him off to the war in Spain; and if\nin three years after that he sticks to that Danish Nausicaa, and I am\nalive--why, then, he shall have her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Hales threw back his head--for he had a large, deep head, and when\nit wanted to think it would go back--and then he answered warily:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a very poor offer, Sir Roland. At first sight it seems fair\nenough. But you, with your knowledge of youth, and especially such a\nyouth as Hilary, rely upon the effects of absence, change, adventures,\ndangers, Spanish beauties, and, worst of all, wider knowledge of the\nworld, and the company of coarse young men, to make him jilt his love,\nor perhaps take even a worse course than that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland, with much contempt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Remnant\nChapman might so have meant it. Struan, you ought to know me better.\nBut I think that I have a right, at least, to try the substance of such\na whim, before I yield to it, and install, as the future mistress,\na--well, what do you want me to call her, Struan?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet it be, Roland; let it be. I am a fair man, if you are not; and I\ncan make every allowance for you. But I think that your heir should at\nleast be entitled to swing his legs over a horse, Sir Roland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI, on the other hand, think that it would be his final ruin to do so.\nHe would get among reckless fellows, to whom he is already too much\nakin. It has happened so with several of my truly respected ancestors.\nThey have gone into cavalry regiments, and ridden full gallop through\ntheir estates. I am not a penurious man, as you know; and few think\nless of money. Can you deny that, even in your vitiated state of mind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot deny it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Rector answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou never think twice about\nmoney, Roland--except, of course, when you are bound to do so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well; then you can believe that I wish poor Hilary to start\nafoot, solely for his own benefit. There is very hard fighting just now\nin Spain, or on the confines of Portugal. I hate all fighting, as you\nare aware. Still it is a thing that must be done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow you do talk! As if it was so many\npartridges!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, it is better than that--come, Struan--because the partridges carry\nno guns you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should be confoundedly sorry if they did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Rector answered, with\na shudder. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFancy letting fly at a bird who might have a long barrel\nunder his tail!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is an appalling imagination. Struan, I give you credit for it. But\nhere we are, as usual, wandering from the matter which we have in hand.\nAre you content, or are you not, with what I propose about Hilary?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn this expressly alternative form, there lurks a great deal of vigour.\nIf a man says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you satisfied?\u00e2\u0080\u009d you begin to cast about and wonder,\nwhether you might not win better terms. Many side-issues come in and\ndisturb you; and your way to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes\u00e2\u0080\u009d looks too positive. But if he\nonly clench his inquiry with the option of the strong negative, the\nweakest of all things, human nature that hates to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cno,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is tampered\nwith. This being so, Uncle Struan thought for a moment or so; and then\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nPUBLIC AND PRIVATE OPINION.\n\n\nIs it just or even honest--fair, of course, it cannot be--to deal so\nmuch with the heavy people, the eldermost ones and the bittermost, and\nleave altogether with nothing said of her--or not even let her have her\nown say--as sweet a young maiden as ever lived, and as true, and brave,\nand kind an one? Alice was of a different class altogether from Mabel\nLovejoy. Mabel was a dear-hearted girl, loving, pure, unselfish, warm,\nand good enough to marry any man, and be his own wife for ever.\n\nBut Alice went far beyond all that. Her nature was cast in a different\nmould. She had not only the depth--which is the common property of\nwomen--but she also had the height of loving. Such as a mother has for\nher children; rather than a wife towards her husband. And yet by no\nmeans an imperious or exacting affection, but tender, submissive, and\ndelicate. Inasmuch as her brother stood next to her father, or in some\npoints quite on a level with him, in her true regard and love, it was\nnot possible that her kind heart could escape many pangs of late. In\nthe first place, no loving sister is likely to be altogether elated by\nthe discovery that her only brother has found some one who shall be\nhenceforth more to him than herself is. Alice, moreover, had a very\nstrong sense of the rank and dignity of the Lorraines; and disliked,\neven more than her father did, the importation of this \u00e2\u0080\u009cvegetable\nproduct,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as she rather facetiously called poor Mabel, into their\ncastle of lineage. But now, when Hilary was going away, to be drowned\non the voyage perhaps, or at least to be shot, or sabred, or ridden\nover by those who had horses--while he had none--or even if he escaped\nall that, to be starved, or frozen, or sunstruck, for the sake of his\ncountry--as our best men are, while their children survive to starve\nafterwards--it came upon Alice as a heavy blow that she never might\nhappen to see him again. Although her father had tried to keep her from\nthe excitement of the times, and the gasp of the public for dreadful\nnews (a gasp which is deeper and wider always, the longer the time\nof waiting is), still there were too many mouths of rumour for truth\nto stop one in ten of them. Although the old butler turned his cuffs\nup--to show what an arm he still possessed--and grumbled that all this\nwas nothing, and a bladder of wind in comparison with what he had known\nforty years agone; and though Mrs. Pipkins, the housekeeper, quite\nagreed with him and went further; neither was the cook at all disposed\nto overdo the thing; it was of no service--they could not stay the\ntorrent of public opinion.\n\nTrotman had been taken on, rashly (as may have been said before), as\nupper footman in lieu of the old-established and trusty gentleman,\nwho had been compelled by fierce injustice to retire, and take to a\npublic-house--with a hundred pounds to begin upon--being reft of the\noffice of footman for no other reason that he could hear of, except\nthat he was apt to be, towards nightfall, not quite able to \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep his\nfeet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo him succeeded the headlong Trotman: and one of the very first things\nhe did was--as declared a long time ago, with deep sympathy, in this\nunvarnished tale--to kick poor Bonny, like a hopping spider, from the\nbrow of the hill to the base thereof.\n\nTrotman may have had good motives for this rather forcible movement:\nand it is not our place to condemn him. Still, in more than one quarter\nit was believed that he had acted thus, through no zeal whatever for\nvirtue or justice; but only because he so loved his perquisites, and\nsuspected that Bonny got smell of them. And the butler quite confirmed\nthis view, and was much surprised at Trotman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct; for Bonny was\naccustomed to laugh at his jokes, and had even sold some of his bottles\nfor him.\n\nIn such a crisis, scarcely any one would regard such a trivial matter.\nAnd yet none of us ought to kick anybody, without knowing what it may\nlead to. Violence is to be deprecated: for it has to be paid for beyond\nits value, in twelve cases out of every dozen. And so it was now; for,\nif Coombe Lorraine had been before this, as Mrs. Pipkins declared\n(having learned French from her cookery-book), \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most Triestest\nplace in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it became even duller now that Bonny was induced,\nby personal considerations, to terminate rather abruptly his overtures\nto the kitchenmaid. For who brought the tidings of all great events and\nroyal proceedings? Our Bonny. Who knew the young man of every housemaid\nin the vales of both Adur and Arun? Our Bonny. Who could be trusted to\ncarry a scroll (or in purer truth perhaps, a scrawl) that should be\ntreasured through the love-lorn hours of waiting--at table--in a zebra\nwaistcoat? Solely and emphatically Bonny!\n\nTherefore every tender domestic bosom rejoiced when the heartless\nTrotman was compelled to tread the track of his violence, lamely and\npainfully, twice every week, to fetch from Steyning his _George and the\nDragon_, which used to be delivered by Bonny. Mr. Trotman, however,\nwas a generous man, and always ready to share, as well as enjoy, the\ndelights of literature. Nothing pleased him better than to sit on the\nend of a table among the household ladies and gentlemen, with Mrs.\nPipkins in the chair of honour, and interpret from his beloved journal,\nthe chronicles of the county, the country, and the Continent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, ho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted out one day, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this? Can I believe my\nheyes? Our Halary going to the wars next week!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNever can be!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost shameful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d some of his audience\nexclaimed. But Mrs. Pipkins and the old butler shook their heads at one\nanother, as much as to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knowed it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Trotman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the senior housemaid, who entertained connubial\nviews; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are sure to be right in all you reads. You are such a\nbootiful scholard! Will you obleege us by reading it out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHem! hem! Ladies all, it is yours to command, it is mine to obey. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The\ninsatiable despot who sways the Continent seems resolved to sacrifice\nto his baleful lust of empire all the best and purest and noblest of\nthe blood of Britain. It was only last week that we had to mourn the\nloss sustained by all Sussex in the most promising scion of a noble\nhouse. And now we have it on the best authority that Mr. H. L., the\nonly son of the well-known and widely-respected baronet residing not\nfifty miles from Steyning, has received orders to join his regiment at\nthe seat of war, under Lord Wellington. The gallant young gentleman\nsails next week from Portsmouth in the troopship Sandylegs\u00e2\u0080\u0099--or some\nsuch blessed Indian name!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe old scrimp!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the cook, a warm ally to poor Hilary.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo send him out in a nasty sandy ship, when his birth were to go on\nhorseback, the same as all the gentlefolks do to the wars!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Mrs. Merryjack, you forget,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained the accomplished Trotman,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat Great Britain is a hisland, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am. And no one can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ride from a\nhisland on horseback; at least it was so when I was a boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it must be so now, John Trotman; for what but a boy are you now,\nI should like to know! And a bad-mannered boy, in my humble opinion, to\nwant to teach his helders their duty. I know that I lives in a hisland,\nof course, the same as all the Scotchmen does, and goes round the sun\nlike a joint on a spit: and so does nearly all of us. But perhaps John\nTrotman doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith this \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithering sarcasm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the ladycook turned away from poor\nTrotman, and then delivered these memorable words--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Rowland will repent too late. Sir Rowland will shed the briny\ntear, the same as might any one of us, even on \u00c2\u00a33 a-year, for sending\nhis only son out in a ship, when he ought to a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sent \u00e2\u0080\u0099un on horseback.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Pipkins nodded assent, and so did the ancient butler: and Trotman\nfelt that public opinion was wholly against him, until such time as it\nshould be further educated.\n\nBut such a discussion had been aroused, that there was no chance of\nits stopping here; and Alice, who loved to collect opinions, had many\nlaid before her. She listened to all judiciously, and pretended to\ndo it judicially; and after that she wondered whether she had done\nwhat she ought to do. For she knew that she was only very young, with\nnobody to advise her; and the crushing weight of the world upon her,\nif she tripped or forgot herself. Most girls of her age would have\nbeen at school, and taken childish peeps at the world, and burnished\nup their selfishness by conflict with one another; but Sir Roland had\nkept to the family custom, and taught and trained his daughter at\nhome, believing as he did that young women lose some of their best\nand most charming qualities by what he called \u00e2\u0080\u009cgregarious education.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAlice therefore had been under care of a good and a well-taught\ngoverness--for \u00e2\u0080\u009cmasters\u00e2\u0080\u009d at that time were proper to boys--until her\nmind was quite up to the mark, and capable of taking care of itself.\nFor, in those days, it was not needful for any girl to know a great\ndeal more than was good for her.\n\nEarly one September evening, when the day and year hung calmly in\nthe balance of the sun; when sensitive plants and clever beasts were\nbeginning to look around them, and much of the growth of the ground was\nready to regret lost opportunities; when the comet was gone for good at\nlast, and the earth was beginning to laugh at her terror (having found\nhim now clearly afraid of her), and when a sense of great deliverance\nfrom the power of drought and heat throbbed in the breast of dewy\nnurture, so that all took breath again, and even man (the last of all\nthings to be pleased or thankful) was ready to acknowledge that there\nmight have been worse moments,--at such a time fair Alice sat in her\ngarden thinking of Hilary. The work of the summer was over now, and\nthe fate of the flowers pronounced and settled, for better or worse,\ntill another year; no frost, however, had touched them yet, while the\nheavy dews of autumnal night, and the brisk air flowing from the open\ndowns, had gladdened, refreshed, and sweetened them. Among them, and\nbetween the shrubs, there spread and sloped a pleasant lawn for all\nwho love soft sward and silence, and the soothing sound of leaves.\nFrom the form of the ground and bend of the hills, as well as the\nnortherly aspect, a peculiar cast and tingle of the air might be found,\nat different moments, fluctuating differently. Most of all, in a fine\nsunset of autumn (though now the sun was behind the ridge), from the\nfulness of the upper sky such gleam and glance fell here and there,\nthat nothing could be sure of looking as it looked only a minute ago.\nAt such times all the glen seemed thrilling like one vast lute of trees\nand air, drawing fingered light along the chords of trembling shadow.\nAt such a time, no southern slope could be compared with this, for\ndepth of beauty and impressive power, for the charm of clear obscurity\nand suggestive murmuring mystery. A time and scene that might recall\nthe large romance of grander ages; where wandering lovers might shrink\nand think of lovers whose love was over; and even the sere man of the\nworld might take a fresh breath of the boyish days when fear was a\npleasant element.\n\nSuddenly Alice became aware of something moving near her; and almost\nbefore she had time to be frightened, Hilary leaped from behind a\nlaurel. He caught her in his arms, and kissed her, and then stepped\nback to leave plenty of room for contemplative admiration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was resolved to have one more look. We sail to-morrow, they are in\nsuch a hurry. I have walked all the way from Portsmouth. At least I got\na little lift on the road, on the top of a waggon-load of wheat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow wonderfully good of you, Hilary dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed, with tears\nin her eyes, and yet a strong inclination to smile, as she watched him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow tired you must be! Why, when did you leave the d\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t? I thought\nthey kept you at perpetual drill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo they did. But I soon got up to all that. I can do it as well as\nthe best of them now. What a provoking child you are! Well, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\nnotice anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor Alice, with true sisterly feeling, was trying his endurance to the\nutmost, dissembling all her admiration of his fine fresh \u00e2\u0080\u009cuniform.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of\ncourse, this was not quite so grand as if he had been (as he had right\nto be) enrolled as an \u00e2\u0080\u009c_eques auratus_;\u00e2\u0080\u009d still it looked very handsome\non his fine straight figure, and set off the brightness of his clear\ncomplexion. Moreover, his two months of drilling at the d\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t had given\nto his active and well-poised form that vigorous firmness which alone\nwas needed to make it perfect. With the quickness of a girl, his sister\nsaw all this in a moment; and yet, for fear of crying, she laughed at\nhim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, how did you come so \u00e2\u0080\u0098spick and span\u00e2\u0080\u0099? Have you got a sheaf of\nwheat inside your waistcoat? It was too cruel to put such clothes on\nthe top of a harvest-waggon. I wonder you did not set it all on fire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch you know about it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the young soldier, with vast\nchagrin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve to see anything. I brought my togs in a\nhaversack, and put them on in your bower here, simply to oblige you;\nand you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think they are worth looking at!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am looking with all my might; and yet I cannot see anything of a\nsword. I suppose they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow you one yet. But surely you must have\na sword in the end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice, you are enough to wear one out. Could I carry my sword in a\nhaversack? However, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I look well, somebody else\ndoes--that is one comfort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do not mean, I hope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Alice, missing his allusion\ncarefully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto go back to your ship without coming to see papa, dear\nHilary?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is exactly what I do mean; and that is why I have watched for you\nso. I have no intention of knocking under. And so he will find out in\nthe end; and somebody else, I hope, as well. Everybody thinks I am such\na fool, because I am easy-tempered. Let them wait a bit. They may be\nproud of that never-do-well, silly Hilary yet. In the last few months,\nI can assure you, I have been through things--however, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk\nabout them. They never did understand me at home; and I suppose they\nnever will. But it does not matter. Wait a bit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDarling Hilary! don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk so. It makes me ready to cry to hear you.\nYou will go into some battle, and throw your life away, to spite all of\nus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Though it would serve you right for considering me\nsuch a nincompoop. As if the best, and sweetest, and truest-hearted\ngirl in the universe was below contempt, because her father happens to\ngrow cabbages! What do we grow? Corn, and hay, and sting-nettles, and\ncouch-grass. Or at least our tenants grow them for us, and so we get\nthe money. Well, how are they finer than cabbages?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in and see father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, straining her self-control to\nshun argument. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo come, and see him before you go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, amazing his sister by his new-born\npersistency. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe never has asked me; and I will not do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo tears, no sobs, no coaxings moved him; his troubles had given him\nstrength of will; and he went to the war without seeing his father.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nRAGS AND BONES.\n\n\nOne man there is, or was, who ought to have been brought forward long\nago. Everybody said the same thing of him--he wanted nothing more than\nthe power of insisting upon his reputation, and of checking his own\nbashfulness, to make him one of the foremost men anywhere in or near\nSteyning. His name was Bottler, as everybody knew; and through some\nhereditary veins of thought, they always added \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe pigman\u00e2\u0080\u009d--as if he\nwere a porcine hybrid!\n\nHe was nothing of the sort. He was only a man who stuck pigs, when they\nwanted sticking; and if at such times he showed humanity, how could\nthat identify him with the animal between his knees? He was sensitive\nupon this point at times, and had been known to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am no pigman;\nwhat I am is a master pork-butcher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever, he could not get over his name, any more than anybody else\ncan. And if such a trifle hurt his feelings, he scarcely insisted upon\nthem, until he was getting quite into his fifth quart of ale, and\ndiscovering his true value.\n\nA writer of the first eminence, who used to be called \u00e2\u0080\u009cTully,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but\nnow is euphoniously cited as \u00e2\u0080\u009cKikero,\u00e2\u0080\u009d has taught us that to neglect\nthe world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self is a proof not only of an arrogant,\nbut even of a dissolute mind. Bottler could prove himself not of an\narrogant, and still less of a dissolute mind; he respected the opinion\nof the world; and he showed his respect in the most convincing and\nflattering manner, by his style of dress. He never wore slops, or an\napron even, unless it were at the decease or during the obsequies of a\nporker. He made it a point of honour to maintain an unbroken succession\nof legitimate white stockings--a problem of deep and insatiable anxiety\nto every woman in Steyning town. In the first place, why did he wear\nthem? It took several years to determine this point; but at last it\nwas known, amid universal applause, that he wore them in memory of his\nfirst love. But then there arose a far more difficult and excruciating\nquestion--how did he do it? Had he fifty pairs? Did he wash them\nhimself, or did he make his wife? How could he kill pigs and keep his\nstockings perpetually unsullied? Emphatically and despairingly,--why\nhad they never got a hole in them?\n\nHe, however, with an even mind, trode the checkered path of life, with\nfustian breeches and white stockings. His coat was of West of England\nbroadcloth, and of a rich imperial blue, except where the colour had\nyielded to time; and all his buttons were of burnished brass. His\nhonest countenance was embellished with a fine candid smile, whenever\nhe spoke of the price of pigs or pork; and no one had ever known him to\ntell a lie--or at any rate he said so.\n\nThis good and remarkable man was open to public inspection every\nmorning in his shop, from eight to twelve o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. He then retired to\nhis dinner, and customers might thump and thump with a key or knife, or\neven his own steel, on the counter, but neither Mr. nor Mrs. Bottler\nwould condescend to turn round for them. Nothing less than the chink\nof a guinea would stir them at this sacred time. But if any one had a\nguinea to rattle on the board, and did it cleverly, the blind across\nthe glass door was drawn back on its tape, and out peeped Bottler.\n\nWhen dinner and subsequent facts had been dealt with, this eminent\npigman horsed his cart, hoisted his favourite child in over the\nfootboard, and set forth in quest of pigs, or as he put it more\nelegantly, \u00e2\u0080\u009chanimals german to his profession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That favourite child,\nhis daughter Polly, being of breadth and length almost equal, and\ngifted with \u00e2\u0080\u009cbow-legs\u00e2\u0080\u009d (as the public had ample means of ascertaining),\nwas now about four years old, and possessed of remarkable gravity even\nfor that age. She would stand by the hour between her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knees,\nwhile he guided the shambling horse, and gaze most intently at nothing\nat all; as if it were the first time she ever had enjoyed the privilege\nof inspecting it.\n\nRags and bones (being typical of the beginning and end of humanity)\nhave an inner meaning of their own, and stimulate all who deal in them.\nAt least it often seems to be so, though one must not be too sure of\nit. Years of observation lead us to begin to ask how to observe a\nlittle.\n\nBonny had not waited for this perversity of certainty. He had long been\ntaking observations of Polly Bottler--as he could get them--and the\nmore he saw her, the more his finest feelings were drawn forth by her,\nand the way she stood between her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs. Some boys have been\nknown to keep one virtue so enlarged and fattened up, like the liver of\na Strasburg goose, that the flavour of it has been enough to abide--if\nthey died before dissolution--in the rue of pious memory.\n\nExactly so it was with that Bonny. He never feigned to be an honest\nboy, because it would have been dishonest of him: besides that, he did\nnot know how to do it, and had his own reasons for waiting a bit; yet\nnothing short of downright starvation could have driven him at any time\nto steal so much as one pig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trotter from his patron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cart, or shop,\nor yard. Now this deserves mention, because it proves that there does,\nor at any rate did, exist a discoverable specimen of a virtue so rare,\nthat its existence escaped all suspicion till after the classic period\nof the Latin tongue.\n\nA grateful soul, or a grateful spirit--we have no word to express\n\u00e2\u0080\u009canimus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d though we often express it towards one another--such was\nthe Roman form for this virtue, as a concrete rarity. And a couple of\nthousand years have made it two thousand times more obsolete.\n\nIn one little breast it still abode, purely original and native, and\ngrowing underneath the soil, shy of light and hard to find, like the\ntruffle of the South Downs. Bonny was called, in one breath every\nday, a shameful and a shameless boy; and he may have deserved but a\nmiddling estimate from a lofty point of view. It must be admitted that\nhe slipped sometimes over the border of right and wrong, when a duck or\na rabbit, or a green goose haply, hopped or waddled on the other side\nof it, in the tempting twilight. But even that he avoided doing, until\nhalfpence were scarce and the weather hungry.\n\nNow being, as has been said before, of distinguished countenance\nand costume, he already had made a tender impression upon the heart\nof Polly Bottler; and when she had been very good and conquered the\nalphabet up to P the pig--at which point professional feeling always\novercame the whole family--the reward of merit selected by herself\nwould sometimes be a little visit to Bonny, as the cart came back from\nFindon. There is room for suspicion, however, that true love may not\nhave been the only motive power, or at least that poor Bonny had a very\nformidable rival in Jack the donkey: inasmuch as the young lady always\ndemanded, as the first-fruit of hospitality, a prolonged caracole\non that quadruped, which she always performed in cavalier fashion,\nwhereto the formation of her lower members afforded especial facility.\n\nNow one afternoon towards Allhallows day, when the air was brisk and\nthe crisp leaves rustled, some under foot and some overhead, Mr.\nBottler, upon his return from Storrington, with four pretty porkers in\nunder his net, received from his taciturn daughter that push on his\nright knee, whose import he well understood. It meant--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are going to\nsee Bonny to-day. You must turn on this side, and go over the fields.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, little un,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the pigman answered, with never-failing smile.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDaddy knows as well as you do a\u00e2\u0080\u0099most; though you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect him to\ncome up to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPolly gave a nod, which was as much as any one ever expected of her\nall the time she was out of doors. At home she could talk any number\nto the dozen, when the mood was on her; but directly she got into the\nopen air, the size of the world was too much for her. All she could do\nwas to stand, and wonder, and have the whole of it going through her,\nwithout her feeling anything.\n\nAfter much jolting, and rattling, and squeaking of pigs at the\nroughness of sod or fallow, they won the entrance of Coombe Lorraine,\nand the hermitage of Bonny. That exemplary boy had been all day\npursuing his calling with his usual diligence, and was very busy now,\nblowing up his fire to have some hot savoury stew to warm him. All his\nbeggings and his buyings, &c., were cast in together; and none but the\ncook and consumer could tell how marvellously they always managed to\nagree among themselves, and with him. A sharp little turn of air had\nset in, and made every rover of the land sharp set; and the lid of the\npot was beginning to lift charily and preciously, when the stubble\nand bramble crackled much. Bonny ensconced in his kitchen corner, on\nthe right hand outside his main entrance, kept stirring the fire, and\nwarming his hands, and indulging in a preliminary smell. Bearing ever\nin mind the stern duty of promoting liberal sentiments, he had felt,\nwhile passing an old woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garden, how thoroughly welcome he ought\nto be to a few sprigs of basil, a handful of onions, and a pinch of\nlemon-thyme; and how much more polite it was to dispense with the\nfrigid ceremony of asking.\n\nAs the cart rattled up in the teeth of the wind, Polly Bottler began to\nexpand her frank ingenuous nostrils; inhaled the breeze, and thus spake\nwith her mouth--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDad, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099se yerry hungy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo wonder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the paternal voice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat a boy, to be sure, that\nis to cook! At his time of life, just to taste his stoos! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got\na born knowledge what to put in--ay, and what to keep out; and how\nlong to do it. He deserveth that pot as I gived him out of the bilin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nhouse; now dothn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he? If moother worn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looking for us to home, with\nchittlings and fried taties, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d as lief sit down and sup with him. He\nmaketh me in the humour, that he doth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs soon as he beheld his visitors, Bonny advanced in a graceful manner,\nas if his supper was of no account. He had long been aware, from the\ncomments of boys at Steyning (who were hostile to him), that his\nchimney-pot hat was not altogether in strict accord with his character.\nThis had mortified him as deeply as his lightsome heart could feel;\nbecause he had trusted to that hat to achieve his restoration into the\nbosom of society. The words of the incumbent of his parish (ere ever\nthe latter began to thrash him) had sunk into his inner and deeper\nconsciousness and conscience; and therein had stirred up a nascent\nlonging to have something to say to somebody whose fore-legs were not\nemployed for locomotion any longer.\n\nAlas, that ghost of a definition has no leg to stand upon! No two great\nauthorities (perfect as they are, and complete in their own system)\ncan agree with one another concerning the order of a horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet,\nin walking, ambling, or trotting, or even standing on all fours in\nstable. The walk of a true-born Briton is surely almost as important\na question. Which arm does he swing to keep time with which leg; and\nbends he his elbows in time with his knees; and do all four occupy the\nair, or the ground, or himself, in a regulated sequence; and if so,\nwhat aberration must ensue from the use of a walking-stick? \u00c5\u0092dipus,\nwho knew all about feet (from the tenderness of his own soles), could\nscarcely be sure of all this, before the time of the close of the\nmarket.\n\nThis is far too important a question to be treated hastily. Only, while\none is about it, let Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hat be settled for. Wherever he thought\nto have made an impression with this really guinea-hat, ridicule and\nexecration followed on his naked heels; till he sold it at last for\ntenpence-halfpenny, and came back to his naked head. Society is not to\nbe carried by storm even with a picked-up hat.\n\nJack, the donkey, was always delighted to have Polly Bottler upon\nhis back. Not perhaps from any vaticination of his future mistress,\nbut because she was sure to reward him with a cake, or an apple, or\nsomething good; so that when he felt her sturdy little legs, both\nhands in his mane, and the heels begin to drum, he would prick his\nlong ears, and toss his fine white nose, and would even have arched\nhis neck, if nature had not strictly forbidden him. On the present\noccasion, however, Polly did not very long witch the world with noble\ndonkeymanship; although Mr. Bottler sat patiently in his cart, smiling\nas if he could never kill a pig, and with paternal pride stamped on\nevery wrinkle of his nose; while the brief-lived porkers poked their\nsnouts through the net, and watched with little sharp hairy eyes the\nvery last drama perhaps in which they would be spectators only. The\nlively creatures did not suspect that Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fire, the night after\nnext, would be cooking some of their vital parts, with a truly fine\nsmell of sausages.\n\nSausages were too dear for Bonny; as even the pigs at a glance were\naware; but he earned three quarters of a pound for nothing, by noble\nhospitality. To wit, his angel of a Polly had not made more than three\nor four parades, while he (with his head scarcely reaching up to the\nmark at the back of the donkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears, where the perspiration powdered)\nshouted, and holloaed, and made-believe to be very big--as boys must\ndo, for practice towards their manhood--when by some concurrent\ngoodwill of air and fire, and finer elements, the pot-lid arose, to\nlet out a bubble of goodness returning to its native heaven; and the\nvolatile virtue gently hovered to leave a fair memory behind.\n\nThe merest corner of this fragrance flipped into Polly Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose,\nas a weaker emanation had done, even before she began her ride. And\nthis time her mouth and her voice expressed cessation of hesitation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Et me down, \u00e2\u0080\u0099et me down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, stretching her fat short arms to\nBonny; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI \u00e2\u0080\u0099ants some; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099se so hungy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStop a bit, miss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bonny, as being the pink of politeness to\nall the fair: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere, your purty little toes is on the blessed ground\nagain. Stop a bit, miss, while I runs into my house, for to get the\nspoon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor up to this time he had stirred his soup with a forked stick made\nof dogwood, which helps to flavour everything; but now as a host, he\nwas bound to show his more refined resources. Polly, however, was\nso rapt out of her usual immobility, that she actually toddled into\nBonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house to make him be quick about the spoon. He, in amazement,\nturned round and stared, to be sure of his eyes that such a thing could\never have happened to him. The jealousy of the collector strove with\nthe hospitality of the householder and the chivalry of the rover. But\nthe finer feelings conquered, and he showed her round the corner. Mr.\nBottler, who could not get in, cracked his whip and whistled at them.\n\nPolly, with great eyes of wonder and fright at her own daring, longed\nwith one breath to go on, and with the next to run back again. But the\nboy caught hold of her hand, and she stuck to him through the ins and\nouts of light, until there was something well worth seeing.\n\nWhat is the sweetest thing in life? Hope, love, gold, fame, pride,\nrevenge, danger--or anything else, according to the nature of the\nliver. But with those who own very little, and have \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome across\u00e2\u0080\u009d all\nthat little, with risk and much uncertainty, the sweetest thing in\nlife is likely to be the sense of ownership. The mightiest hoarder of\ngold and silver, Cr\u00c5\u0093sus, Rhampsinitus, or Solomon, never thought half\nso much of his stores, or at any rate, never enjoyed them as much as\nthis rag-and-bone collector his. When he came to his room he held his\nbreath, and watched with the greatest anxiety for corresponding emotion\nof Polly.\n\nThe room was perhaps about twelve feet long, and eight feet wide at\nits utmost, scooped from the chalk without any sharp corners, but with\na grand contempt of shape. The floor went up and down, and so did the\nroof, according to circumstances; the floor appearing inclined to rise,\nand the roof to come down if called upon. Much excellent rubbish was\nhere to be found; but the window was the first thing to seize and hold\nany stranger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention. It must have been built either by or for the\nold hermit who once had dwelt there; at any rate no one could have\ndesigned it without a quaint ingenuity. It was cut through a three-foot\nwall of chalk, the embrasure being about five feet in span, and three\nfeet deep at the crown of the arch. In the middle, a narrow pier of\nchalk was left to keep the arch up, and the lights on either side\nwere made of horn, stained glass, and pig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bladder. The last were of\nBonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handiwork, to keep out the wind when it blew too cold among the\nflaws of ages. And now as the evening light fetched round the foot of\nthe hills, and gathered strongly into this western aspect, the richness\nof colours was such that even Polly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steadfast eyes were dazed.\n\nWithout vouchsafing so much as a glance at Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hoarded glories,\nthe child ran across the narrow chamber, and spread out her hands and\nopened her mouth wider even than her eyes, at the tints now streaming\nin on her. The glass had been brought perhaps from some ruined chapel\nof the hill-side, and glowed with a depth of colour infused by\ncenturies of sunset; not one pane of regular shape was to be found\namong them; but all, like veins of marble, ran with sweetest harmony of\nhue, to meet the horn and the pig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bladder. From the outside it looked\nlike a dusty slate traversed with bits of a crusted bottle; it required\nto be seen from the inside, like an ancient master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s painting.\n\nPolly, like the rest of those few children who do not overtalk\nthemselves, spent much of her time in observation, storing the entries\ninwardly. And young as she was, there might be perhaps a doubt\nentertained by those who knew her whether she were not of a deeper and\nmore solid cast of mind than Bonny. Her father at any rate declared,\nand her mother was of the same opinion, that by the time she was ten\nyears old she would buy and sell all Steyning. However, they may have\nthought all this because all their other children were so stupid.\n\nNow, be they right or be they wrong--as may be shown hereafter--Polly\npossessed at least the first and most essential of all the many\nendowments needful to approach success. Polly Bottler stuck to her\npoint. And now, even with those fine old colours, like a century of\nrainbows, puzzling her, Polly remembered the stew in the pot, and\npointed with her finger to the window-ledge where something shone in a\nrich blue light.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a \u00e2\u0080\u0099poon, Bonny!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed; \u00e2\u0080\u009chere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a \u00e2\u0080\u0099poon! \u00e2\u0080\u0099Et me have\nit, Bonny.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a spoon, miss; and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make out for the life of\nme whatever it can be. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve a seed a many queer things, but I never\nseed the likes of that afore. Ah, take care, miss, or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cut your\nfingers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor Polly, with a most resolute air, had scrambled to the top of an old\nbrown jar (the salvage from some shipwreck) which stood beneath the\nwindow-sill, and thence with a gallant sprawl she reached and clutched\nthe shining implement which she wanted to eat her stew with. The boy\nwas surprised to see her lift it with her fat brown fingers, and hold\nit tightly without being cut or stung, as he expected. For he had a\nwholesome fear of this thing, and had set it up as a kind of fetish,\nhis mind (like every other) requiring something to bow down to. For the\nmanner of his finding it first, and then its presentment in the mouth\nof Jack, added to the interest which its unknown meaning won for it.\n\nWith a laugh of triumph, the bow-legged maiden descended from her\ndangerous height, and paying no heed to all Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treasures, waddled\naway with her new toy, either to show it to her father, or to plunge\nit into the stewpot perhaps. But her careful host, with an iron spoon\nand a saucer in his hands, ran after her, and gently guided her to the\ncrock, whither also Mr. Bottler sped. This was as it should be; and\nthey found it so. For when the boy Bonny, with a hospitable sweep,\nlifted the cover of his cookery, a sense of that void which all nature\nprotests against rose in the forefront of all three, and forebade them\nto seek any further. Bottler himself, in the stress of the moment, let\nthe distant vision fade--of fried potatoes and combed chittlings--and\nlapsed into that lowest treason to Lares and Penates--a supper abroad,\nwhen the supper at home is salted, and peppered, and browning.\n\nBut though Polly opened her mouth so wide, and smacked her lips, and\nmade every other gratifying demonstration, not for one moment would she\ncede possession of the treasure she had found in Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window. Even\nwhile most absorbed in absorbing, she nursed it jealously on her lap;\nand even when her father had lit his pipe from Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bonfire, and\nwas ready to hoist her again over the footboard, the child stuck fast\nto her new delight, and set up a sturdy yell when the owner came to\nreclaim it from her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d began the gentle\npork-butcher, as the pigs in the cart caught up the strain, and echo\nhad enough to do; for Polly of course redoubled her wailings, as all\nlittle dears must, when coaxed to stop; \u00e2\u0080\u009chere, Bonny, here lad, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ngie thee sixpence for un, though her ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worth a penny, I doubt.\nAnd thou may\u00e2\u0080\u0099st call to-morrow, and the Misses \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll gie thee a clot of\nsassages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBonny looked longingly at his fetish; but gratitude and true love got\nthe better of veneration. Polly, moreover, might well be trusted to\npreserve this idol, until in the day when he made his own, it should\nreturn into his bosom. And so it came to pass that this Palladium of\nthe hermitage was set up at the head of Polly Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little crib,\nand installed in the post of her favourite doll.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nUNDER DEADLY FIRE.\n\n\nThough Coombe Lorraine was so old a mansion, and so full of old\ncustoms, the Christmas of the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomet year\u00e2\u0080\u009d was as dull as a Sunday in\na warehouse. Hilary (who had always been the life of the place) was\nfar away, fed upon hardships and short rations. Alice, though full\nsometimes of spirits, at other times would run away and fret, and blame\nherself, as if the whole of the fault was on her side. This was of\ncourse an absurd idea; but sensitive girls, in moods of dejection, are\nnot good judges of absurdity; and Alice at such times fully believed\nthat if she had not intercepted so much of her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affection from\nher brother, things would have been very different. It might have been\nso; but the answer was, that she never had wittingly stood between\nthem; but on the contrary had laid herself out, even at the risk of\noffending both, to bring their widely different natures into kinder\nunity.\n\nSir Roland also was becoming more and more reserved and meditative.\nHe would sit for hours in his book-room, immersed in his favourite\nstudies, or rather absorbed in his misty abstractions. And Lady\nValeria did not add to the cheer of the household, although perhaps\nshe did increase its comfort, by suddenly ceasing to interfere with\nMrs. Pipkins and everybody else, and sending for the parson of the\nnext parish, because she had no faith in Mr. Hales. That worthy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nunprofessional visits, and those of his wife and daughters, were now\nalmost the only pleasant incidents of the day or week. For the country\nwas more and more depressed by gloomy burden of endless war, the\nscarcity of the fruits of the earth, and the slaughter of good brave\npeople. So that as the time went on, what with miserable expeditions,\npestilence, long campaigns, hard sieges, furious battles, and\nstarvation--there was scarcely any decent family that was not gone into\nmourning.\n\nEven the Rector, as lucky a man as ever lived, had lost a nephew, or at\nleast a nephew of his dear wife,--which, he said, was almost worse to\nhim--slain in battle, fighting hard for his country and constitution.\nMr. Hales preached a beautiful sermon, as good as a book, about it; so\nthat all the parish wept, and three young men enlisted.\n\nThe sheep were down in the lowlands now, standing up to their knees in\nlitter, and chewing very slowly; or sidling up against one another\nin the joy of woolliness; or lying down, with their bare grave noses\nstretched for contemplation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, winking with their gentle eyes, and\nthanking God for the roof above them, and the troughs in front of them.\nThey never regarded themselves as mutton, nor their fleeces as worsted\nyarn: it was really sad to behold them, and think that the future could\nnot make them miserable.\n\nNo snow had fallen; but all the downs were spread with that sombre\nbrown which is the breath or the blast of the wind-frost. But Alice\nLorraine took her daily walk, for her father forbade her to ride on the\nhill-tops in the bleak and bitter wind. Her thoughts were continually\nof her brother; and as the cold breeze rattled her cloak, or sprayed\nher soft hands through her gloves, many a time she said to herself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nsuppose there is no frost in Spain; or not like this at any rate. How\ncould the poor fellow sleep in a tent in such dreadful weather as this\nis?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHow little she dreamed that he had to sleep (whenever he got such a\nblissful chance) not in a tent, but an open trench, with a keener wind\nand a blacker frost preying on his shivering bones, while cannon-balls\nand fiery shells in a pitiless storm rushed over him! It was no\nfeather-bed fight that was fought in front of Ciudad Rodrigo. About the\nmiddle of January, A.D. 1812, desperate work was going on.\n\nFor now there was no time to think of life. Within a certain number\nof days the fort must be taken, or the army lost. The defences were\nstrong, and the garrison brave, and supplied with artillery far\nsuperior to that of the besiegers; the season also, and the bitter\nweather, fought against the British; and so did the indolence of their\nallies; and so did British roguery. The sappers could only work in\nthe dark (because of the grape from the ramparts); and working thus,\nthe tools either bent beneath their feet or snapped off short. The\ncontractor had sent out false-grained stuff, instead of good English\nsteel and iron; and if in this world he earned his fortune, he assured\nhis fate in the other.\n\nAt length by stubborn perseverance, most of these troubles were\novercome, and the English batteries opened. Roar answered roar, and\nbullet bullet, and the black air was striped with fire and smoke; and\nmen began to study the faces of the men that shot at them, until after\nsome days of hard pounding, it was determined to rush in. All who care\nto read of valour know what a desperate rush it was,--how strong men\nstruggled, and leaped, and clomb, hung, and swung, on the crest of\nthe breach, like stormy surges towering, and then leaped down upon\nspluttering shells, drawn swords, and sparkling bayonets.\n\nBefore the signal to storm was given, and while men were talking of it,\nHilary Lorraine felt most uncomfortably nervous. He did not possess\nthat solid phlegm which is found more often in square-built people;\nneither had he any share of fatalism, cold or hot. He was nothing\nmore than a spirited young Englishman, very fond of life, hating\ncruelty, and fearing to have any hand in it. Although he had been in\nthe trenches, and exposed to frequent dangers, he had not been in\nhand-to-hand conflict yet; and he knew not how he might behave. He knew\nthat he was an officer now in the bravest and hardiest armies known on\nearth since the time of the Samnites--although perhaps not the very\nbest behaved, as they proved that self-same night. And not only that,\nbut an officer of the famous Light Division, and the fiercest regiment\nof that division--everywhere known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFighting-cocks\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and he was\nnot sure that he could fight a frog. He was sure that he never could\nkill anybody, at least in his natural state of mind; and worse than\nthat, he was not at all sure that he could endure to be killed himself.\n\nHowever, he made preparation for it. He brought out the Testament Mabel\nhad given him as a parting keepsake, in the moment of true love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npiety; and he opened it at a passage marked with a woven tress of\nher long rich hair--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSoldiers, do that is commanded of you;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he\nwondered whether he could manage it. And while he was trembling, not\nwith the fear of the enemy, but of his own young heart, the Colonel of\nthat regiment came, and laid his one hand on Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder, and\nlooked into his bright blue eyes. In all the army there was no braver,\nnobler, or kinder-hearted man, than Colonel C---- of that regiment.\n\nHilary looked at this true veteran with all the reverence, and even\nawe, which a young subaltern (if fit for anything) feels for commanding\nexperience. Never a word he spoke, however, but waited to be spoken to.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will do, lad. You will do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Colonel, who had little time\nto spare. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would rather see you like that, than uproarious, or even\nas cool as a cucumber. I was just like that, before my first action.\nLorraine, you will not disgrace your family, your country, or your\nregiment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Colonel had lost two sons in battle, younger men than Hilary,\notherwise he might not have stopped to enter into an ensign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind. But\nevery word he spoke struck fire in the heart of this gentle youth. True\ngratitude chokes common answers; and Hilary made none to him. An hour\nafterwards he made it, by saving the life of the Colonel.\n\nThe Light Division (kept close and low from the sight of the sharp\nFrench gunners) were waiting in a hollow curve of the inner parallel,\nwhere the ground gave way a little, under San Francisco. There had been\nno time to do anything more than breach the stone of the ramparts; all\nthe outer defences were almost as sound as ever. The Light Division had\norders to carry the lesser breach--cost what it might--and then sweep\nthe ramparts as far as the main breach, where the strong assault was.\nAnd so well did they do their work, that they turned the auxiliary into\nthe main attack, and bodily carried the fortress.\n\nFor, sooth to say, they expected, but could not manage to wait for,\nthe signal to storm. No sooner did they hear the firing on the right\nthan they began to stamp and swear; for the hay-bags they were to throw\ninto the ditch were not at hand, and not to be seen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre we horses,\nto wait for the hay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried an Irishman of the Fifty-second; and with\nthat they all set off as fast as ever their legs could carry them.\nHilary laughed--for his sense of humour was never very far to seek--at\nthe way in which these men set off, as if it were a game of football;\nand at the wonderful mixture of fun and fury in their faces. Also, at\nthis sudden burlesque of the tragedy he expected--with heroes out at\nheels and elbows, and small-clothes streaming upon the breeze. For the\nBritish Government, as usual, left coats, shoes, and breeches, to last\nfor ever.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRun, lad, run,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Major Malcolm, in his quiet Scottish way; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nare bound to be up with them, as one might say; and your legs are unco\nlong. I shal na hoory mysell, but take the short cut over the open.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I come with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Hilary, panting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have na mither nor wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Major; \u00e2\u0080\u009cna wife, of course,\nby the look of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLorraine had no sense what he was about; for the grapeshot whistled\nthrough the air like hornets, and cut off one of his loose fair locks,\nas he crossed the open with Major Malcolm, to head their hot men at the\ncrest of the glacis.\n\nNow, how things happened after that, or even what things happened at\nall, that headlong young officer never could tell. As he said in his\nletter to Gregory Lovejoy--for he was not allowed to write to Mabel,\nand would not describe such a scene to Alice--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe chief thing I\nremember is a lot of rushing and stumbling, and swearing and cheering,\nand staggering and tumbling backward. And I got a tremendous crack on\nthe head from a cannon laid across the top of the breach, but luckily\nnot a loaded one; and I believe there were none of our fellows in front\nof me; but I cannot be certain, because of the smoke, and the row,\nand the rush, and confusion; and I saw a Crapaud with a dead level\nat Colonel C----. I suppose I was too small game for him,--and I was\njust in time to slash his trigger-hand off (which I felt justified in\ndoing), and his musket went up in the air and went off, and I just\njumped aside from a fine bearded fellow, who rushed at me with a\nbayonet; and before he could have at me again, he fell dead, shot by\nhis own friends from behind, who were shooting at me--more shame to\nthem--when our men charged with empty muskets. And when the breach was\nour own, we were formed on the top of the rampart, and went off at\ndouble-quick, to help at the main breach, and so we did; and that is\nabout all I know of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the more experienced warriors knew a great deal more of Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndoings, especially Colonel C---- of his regiment, and Major Malcolm,\nand Captain M\u00e2\u0080\u0099Leod. All of these said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey never saw any young\nfellow behave so well, for the first time of being under deadly fire;\nthat he might have been \u00e2\u0080\u0098off his head\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for the moment, but that would\nvery soon wear off--or if it did not, all the better, so long as he\nalways did the right thing thus; and (unless he got shot) he would be\nan honour to the country, the army, and the regiment!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nHOW TO FRY NO PANCAKES.\n\n\nHaving no love of bloodshed, and having the luck to know nothing about\nit, some of us might be glad to turn into the white gate across the\nlane, leading into Old Applewood farm--if only the franklin would\nunlock it for anybody, in this war-time. But now he has been getting\nsharper and sharper, month after month; and hearing so much about\nsieges and battles, he never can be certain when the county of Kent\nwill be invaded. For the last ten years, he has expected something\nof the sort at least; and being of a prudent mind, keeps a duck-gun\nheavily loaded.\n\nMoreover, Mabel is back again from exile with Uncle Catherow; and\nthough the Grower only says that \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is well enough, for aught he\nknows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d when compliments are paid him, about her good looks, by the\nneighbourhood, he knows well enough that she is more than that; and\nhe believes all the county to be after her. It is utterly useless to\ndeny--though hot indignation would expand his horticultural breast\nat the thought--that he may have been just a little set up, by that\ntrifling affair about Hilary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt never were the cherries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says\nto himself, as the author of a great discovery; \u00e2\u0080\u009caha, I seed it all\nalong! Wife never guessed of it, but I did\u00e2\u0080\u009d--shame upon thee, Grower,\nfor telling thyself such a dreadful \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaulker!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cand now we can see,\nas plain as a pikestaff, the very thing I seed, when it was that big!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nUpon this he shows himself his thumb-nail, and feels that he has earned\na glass of his ale.\n\nMabel, on the other hand, is dreadfully worried by foreign affairs. She\nwants to know why they must be always fighting; and as nobody can give\nany other reason, except that they \u00e2\u0080\u009csuppose it is natteral,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she only\ncan shake her head very sadly, and ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow would you like to have to\ndo it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey turn up the udders of the cows, to think out this great question,\nand the spurting into the pail stops short, and the cow looks round\nwith great bountiful eyes, and a flat broad nose, and a spotted tongue,\ndesiring to know what they are at with her. Is her milk not worth the\nmilking, pray?\n\nThis leads to no satisfaction whatever, upon behalf of any one; and\nMabel, after a shiver or two, runs back to the broad old fireplace,\nto sit in the light and the smell of the wood, to spread her pointed\nfingers forth, and see how clear they are, and think. For Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands\nare quite as pretty as if they were of true Norman blood, instead of\nthe elder Danish cast; and she is very particular now not to have even\na brown line under her nails.\n\nAnd now in the month of February, 1812, before the witching festival\nof St Valentine was prepared for, with cudgelling of brains, and\nviolent rhymes, and criminal assaults upon grammar, this \u00e2\u0080\u009cflower of\nKent\u00e2\u0080\u009d--as the gallant hop-growers in toasting moments entitled her--was\nsitting, or standing, or drooping her head, or whatever suits best to\ntheir metaphor, at or near the fireplace in the warm old simple hall.\nLove, however warm and faithful, is all the better for a good clear\nfire, ere ever the snowdrops begin to spring. Also it loves to watch\nthe dancing of the flames, and the flickering light, and even in the\nsmoke discovers something to itself akin. Mabel was full of these\nbeautiful dreams, because she was left altogether to herself; and\nbecause she remembered so well what had happened along every inch of\nthe dining-table; and, above all, because she was sleepy. Long anxiety,\nand great worry, and the sense of having no one fit to understand a\ngirl--but everybody taking low, and mercenary, and fickle views, and\neven the most trusty people giving base advice to one, in those odious\nproverbial forms,--\u00e2\u0080\u009ca bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cfast\nfind fast bind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is better fish in the sea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d &c.; Mabel thought\nthere never had been such a selfish world to deal with.\n\nHas not every kind of fame, however pure it may be and exalted, its\nown special disadvantage, lest poor mortals grow too proud? At any\nrate Mabel now reflected, rather with sorrow than with triumph, upon\nher fame for pancakes--because it was Shrove-Tuesday now, and all her\ntender thrills and deep anxieties must be discarded for, or at any\nrate distracted by, the composition of batter. Her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sense of\npropriety was so strong, and that of excellence so keen, that pancakes\nhe would have on Shrove-Tuesday, and pancakes only from Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhand. She had pleaded, however, for leave to make them here in the\ndining-hall, instead of frying at the kitchen fireplace, because she\nknew what Sally the cook and Susan the maid would be at with her.\nThose two girls would never leave her the smallest chance of retiring\ninto her deeper nature, and meditating. Although they could understand\nnothing at all, they would take advantage of her good temper, to enjoy\nthemselves with the most worn-out jokes. Such trumpery was below Mabel\nnow; and some day or other she would let them know it.\n\nWithout thinking twice of such low matters, the maiden was now in great\ntrouble of the heart, by reason of sundry rumours. Paddy from Cork had\nbrought home word from Maidstone only yesterday, that a desperate fight\nhad been fought in Spain, and almost everybody had been blown up. Both\narmies had made up their minds to die, so that, with the drums beating\nand the colours flying, they marched into a powder-magazine, and tossed\nup a pin which should be the one to fire it, and blow up the others.\nAnd the English had lost the toss, and no one survived to tell the\nstory.\n\nMabel doubted most of this, though Paddy vowed that he had known the\nlike, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen wars was wars, and the boys had spirit;\u00e2\u0080\u009d still she felt\nsure that there had been something, and she longed most sadly to know\nall about it. Her brother Gregory was in London, keeping his Hilary\nterm, and slaving at his wretched law-books; and she had begged him,\nif he loved her, to send down all the latest news by John Shorne every\nmarket-day--for the post would not carry newspapers. And now, having\nmixed her batter, she waited, sleepy after sleepless nights, unable to\nleave her post and go to meet the van, as she longed to do, the while\nthe fire was clearing.\n\nPensively sitting thus, and longing for somebody to look at her, she\nglanced at the face of the clock, which was the only face regarding\nher. And she won from it but the stern frown of time--she must set to\nat her pancakes. Batter is all the better for standing ready-made for\nan hour or so, the weaker particles expire, while the good stuff grows\nthe more fit to be fried, and to turn over in the pan properly. With a\ngentle sigh, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cflower of Kent\u00e2\u0080\u009d put her frying-pan on, just to warm\nthe bottom. No lard for her, but the best fresh-butter--at any rate for\nthe first half-dozen, to be set aside for her father and mother; after\nthat she would be more frugal perhaps.\n\nBut just as the butter began to oose on the bottom of the pan, she\nheard, or thought that she heard, a sweet distant tinkle coming through\nthe frosty air; and running to the window she caught beyond doubt the\nsound of the bells at the corner of the lane, the bells that the horses\nalways wore, when the nights were dark and long; and a throb of eager\nhope and fear went to her heart at every tinkle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot wait; how can I wait?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, with flushing cheeks and\neyes twice-laden between smiles and tears; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pancakes can wait\nmuch better. There, go back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she spoke to the frying-pan, as, with\nthe prudent care of a fine young housewife, she lifted it off and laid\nit on the hob, for fear of the butter burning; and then, with quick\nsteps, out she went, not even stopping to find a hat, in her hurry to\nmeet the van, and know the best or the worst of the news of the war.\nFor \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrusty John,\u00e2\u0080\u009d who would go through fire and water to please Miss\nMabel, had orders not to come home without the very latest tidings.\nThere was nothing to go to market now; but the van had been up, with a\nload of straw, to some mews where the Grower had taken a contract; and,\nof course, it came loaded back with litter.\n\nWhile Mabel was all impatience and fright, John Shorne, in the most\ndeliberate manner, descended from the driving-box, and purposely\nshunning her eager glance, began to unfasten the leader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s traces, and\npass them through his horny hands, and coil them into elegant spirals,\nlike horns of Jupiter Ammon. Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fear grew worse and worse, because\nhe would not look at her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, John, you never could have the heart to keep me waiting like this,\nunless----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! you there, Missie? Lor\u00e2\u0080\u0099 now, what can have brought \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee out this\nweather?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs if you did not see me, John! Why you must have seen me all along.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis here be such a dreadful horse to smoke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John, who always\nshunned downright fibs, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat railly I never knows what I do see,\nwhen I be longside of un. Ever since us come out of Sennoaks, he have\na been confusing of me. Not that I blames un, for what a can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help.\nNow there, now! The watter be frozen in trough. Go to the bucket,\njackanapes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh John, you never do seem to think--because you have got so many\nchildren only fit to go to school, you seem to think----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you said as I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think now, Missie, in the last breath of\nyour purty mouth. Well, what is it as I ought to think? Whoa there!\nStand still, wull\u00e2\u0080\u0099ee?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn, you really are too bad. I have been all the morning making\npancakes, and you shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have one, John Shorne, you shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, if you keep\nme waiting one more second.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it consarning they fighting fellows you gets into such a hurry,\nMiss? Well, they have had a rare fight, sure enough! Fourscore officers\ngone to glory, besides all the others as was not worth counting!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh John, you give me such a dreadful pain here! Let me know the worst,\nI do implore you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one of \u00e2\u0080\u0099em. Now, is that enough?\u00e2\u0080\u009d John Shorne made so little\nof true love now, and forgot his early situations so, in the bosom of a\nhungry family, that he looked upon Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoorting\u00e2\u0080\u009d as an agreeable\nplay-ground for little jokes. But now he was surprised and frightened\nat her way of taking them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee cry now, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as she leaned on\nthe shaft of the waggon, and sobbed so that the near wheeler began in\npure sympathy to sniff at her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord bless \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee, there be nothing to cry\nabout. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve abeen and dooed wonders, that \u00e2\u0080\u0099a hath.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course he has, John; he could not help it. He was sure to do\nwonders, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see, if only--if only they did not stop him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe hathn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t killed Bonypart yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John, recovering his vein of\nhumour, as Mabel began to smile through her tears; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I b\u00e2\u0080\u0099lieve he\nwool, if he gooeth on only half so well as he have begun. For my part,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d soonder kill dree of un than sell out in a bad market, I know. But\nhere, you can take it, and read all about un. Lor\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bless me, wherever\nhave I put the papper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow do be quick, John, for once in your life. Dear John, do try to be\nquick, now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStrornary gallantry of a young hofficer! Could have sworn that it were\nin my breeches-pocket. I always thought \u00e2\u0080\u0098gallantry\u00e2\u0080\u0099 meant something\nbad. A running after strange women, and that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, John--oh no, John; it never does. How can you think such\ndreadful things? but how long are you going to be, John?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it did when I wor a boy, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certain. But now they changes\neverything so--even the words we was born to. It have come to mean\nkilling of strange men, hath it? Wherever now can I have put that\npapper? I must have dropped un on the road, after all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou never can have done such a stupid thing!--such a wicked, cruel\nthing, John Shorne! If you have, I will never forgive you. Very likely\nyou put it in the crown of your hat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure enough, and so I did. You must be a witch, Miss Mabel. And here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthe very corner I turned down when I read it to the folk at the Pig and\nWhistle. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Glorious British victory--capture of Shoedad Rodleygo--eighty\nBritish officers killed, and forty great guns taken!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 There, there,\nbless your bright eyes! now will you be content with it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, give it me, give it me! How can I tell until I have read it ten\ntimes over?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCrusty John blessed all the girls of the period (becoming more and more\ntoo many for him) as his master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter ran away to devour that\ngreasy journal. And by the time he had pulled his coat off, and shouted\nfor Paddy and another man, and stuck his own pitchfork into the litter,\nas soon as they had backed the wheelers, Mabel was up in her own little\nroom, and down on her knees to thank the Lord for the abstract herself\nhad made of it. Somehow or other, the natural impulse of all good\ngirls, at that time, was to believe that they had a Creator and Father,\nwhom to thank for all mercies. But that idea has been improved since\nthen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nLADY COKE UPON LITTLETON.\n\n\nAt Coombe Lorraine these things had been known and entered into some\ntime ago. For Sir Roland had not left his son so wholly uncared\nfor in a foreign land as Hilary in his sore heart believed. In his\nregiment there was a certain old major, lame, and addicted to violent\nlanguage, but dry and sensible according to his lights, and truthful,\nand upright, and quarrelsome. Burning to be first, as he always did in\nevery desperate conflict, Major Clumps saw the young fellows get in\nfront of him, and his temper exploded always.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome back, come back, you----\u00e2\u0080\u009d condemned offspring of canine lineage,\nhe used to shout; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet an honest man have a fair start with you!\nBecause my feet are--there you go again; no consideration, any of you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis Major Clumps was admirably \u00e2\u0080\u009cconnected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d being the nephew of Lord\nde Lampnor, the husband of Lady Valeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend. So that by this means\nit was brought round that Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doings should be reported. And Lady\nValeria had received a letter in which her grandson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exploits at the\nstorming of Ciudad Rodrigo were so recounted that Alice wept, and the\nancient lady smiled with pride; and even Sir Roland said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, after\nall, that boy can do something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe following afternoon the master of Coombe Lorraine was sent for,\nto have a long talk with his mother about matters of business. Now\nSir Roland particularly hated business; his income was enough for all\nhis wants; his ambition (if ever he had any) was a vague and vaporous\nelement; he left to his lawyers all matters of law; and even the\nmanagement of his land, but for his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong opposition, he\nwould gladly have left to a steward or agent, although the extent of\nhis property scarcely justified such an appointment. So he entered his\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room that day with a languid step and reluctant air.\n\nThe lady paid very little heed to that. Perhaps she even enjoyed\nit a little. Holding that every man is bound to attend to his own\naffairs, she had little patience and no sympathy with such philosophic\nindifference. On the other hand, Sir Roland could not deny himself a\nlittle quiet smile, when he saw his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great preparations to\nbring him both to book and deed.\n\nLady Valeria Lorraine was sitting as upright as she had sat throughout\nher life, and would sit, until she lay down for ever. On the table\nbefore her were several thick and portentously dirty documents,\narranged and docketed by her own sagacious hand; and beyond these,\nand opened at pages for reference, lay certain old law-books of a most\ndeterrent guise and attitude. Sheppard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cTouchstone\u00e2\u0080\u009d (before Preston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ntime), Littleton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cTenures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Viner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbridgment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Comyn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cDigest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nGlanville, Plowden, and other great authors, were here prepared to\ncause delicious confusion in the keenest feminine intellect; and Lady\nValeria was quite sure now that they all contradicted one another.\n\nAfter the formal salutation, which she always insisted upon, the\nvenerable lady began to fuss about a little, and pretend to be at a\nloss with things. She was always dressed as if she expected a visit\nfrom the royal family; and it was as good as a lecture for any slovenly\nyoung girls to see how cleverly she avoided soil of dirty book, or\ndirtier parchment, upon her white cuffs or Flemish lace. Even her\ndelicate pointed fingers, shrunken as they were with age, had a knack\nof flitting over grime, without attracting it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI daresay you are surprised,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with her usual soft and\ncourteous smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat seeing me employed like this, and turning lawyer\nin my old age.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland said something complimentary, knowing that it was expected\nof him. The ancient lady had always taught him--however erroneous the\ndoctrine--that no man who is at a loss for the proper compliment to a\nlady deserves to be thought a gentleman. She always had treated her son\nas a gentleman, dearer to her than other gentlemen; but still to be\nregarded in that light mainly. And he, perhaps by inheritance, had been\nled to behave to his own son thus--a line of behaviour warmly resented\nby the impetuous Hilary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I beg you to attend--you must try to attend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Lady\nValeria: \u00e2\u0080\u009crouse yourself up, if you please, dear Roland. This is\nnot a question of astrologers, or any queer thing of that sort, but\na common-sense matter, and, I might say, a difficult point of law,\nperhaps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat being so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered, with a smile of bright relief,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cour course becomes very simple. We have nothing that we need trouble\nourselves to be puzzled with uncomfortably. Messrs. Crookson, Hack, and\nClinker--they know how to keep in arrear, and to charge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is your own fault, my dear Roland, if they overcharge you.\nEverybody will do so, when they know that you mean to put up with it.\nYour dear father was under my guidance much more than you have ever\nbeen, and he never let people overcharge him--more than he could help,\nI mean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI quite perceive the distinction, mother. You have put it very\nclearly. But how does that bear upon the matter you have now to speak\nof?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a great many ways. This account of Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desperate behaviour, as\nI must call it upon sound reflection, leads me to consider the great\nprobability of something happening to him. There are many battles yet\nto be fought, and some of them may be worse than this. You remember\nwhat Mr. Malahide said when your dear father would insist upon that\nresettlement of the entire property in the year 1799.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland knew quite well that it was not his dear father at all, but\nhis mother, who had insisted upon that very stringent and ill-advised\nproceeding, in which he himself had joined reluctantly, and only by\ndint of her persistence. However, he did not remind her of this.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember it clearly; and I have his\nvery words somewhere. He declined to draw it in accordance with the\ninstructions of our solicitors, until his own opinion upon it had been\nlaid before the family--a most unusual course, he said, for counsel in\nchambers to adopt, but having some knowledge of the parties concerned,\nhe hoped they would pardon his interference. And then his words were to\nthis effect--\u00e2\u0080\u0098The operation of such a settlement may be most injurious.\nThe parties will be tying their own hands most completely, without--as\nfar as I can perceive--any adequate reason for doing so. Supposing,\nfor instance, there should be occasion for raising money upon these\nestates during the joint lives of the grandson and granddaughter, and\nbefore the granddaughter is of age, there will be no means of doing\nit. The limitation to her, which is a most unusual one in such cases,\nwill preclude the possibility of representing the fee-simple. The young\nlady is now just five years old, and if this extraordinary settlement\nis made, no marketable title can be deduced for the next sixteen\nyears, except, of course, in the case of her decease.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And many other\nobjections he made, all of which, however, were overruled; and after\nthat protest, he prepared the settlement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe matter was hurried through your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state of health; for at\nthat very time he was on his deathbed. But no harm whatever has come of\nit, which shows that we were right, and Mr. Malahide quite wrong. But I\nhave been looking to see what would happen, in case poor Hilary--ah, it\nwas his own fault that all these restrictions were introduced. Although\nhe was scarcely twelve years old, he had shown himself so thoroughly\nvolatile, so very easy to lead away, and, as it used to be called by\nvulgar people, so \u00e2\u0080\u0098happy-go-lucky,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that your dear father wished,\nwhile he had the power, to disable him from lessening any further our\nlessened estates. And but for that settlement, where might we be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, my dear mother, that I never liked that exceedingly\ncomplicated and most mistrustful settlement. And if I had not been so\nsick of all business, after the loss of my dear wife, even your powers\nof persuasion would have failed to make me execute it. At any rate, it\nhas had one good effect. It has robbed poor Hilary, to a great extent,\nof the charms that he must have possessed for the Jews.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can they discover such things? With a firm of trusty and most\nrespectable lawyers--to me it is quite wonderful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many things are wondrous! and nothing more wondrous than man\nhimself--except, of course, a Jew. They do find out; and they never let\nus find out how they managed it. But do let me ask you, my dear mother,\nwhat particular turn of thought has compelled you to be so learned?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean these books? Well, let me think. I quite forget what it was\nthat I wanted. It is useless to flatter me, Roland, now. My memory is\nnot as it was, nor my sight, nor any other gift. However, I ought to be\nvery thankful; and I often try to be so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake a little time to think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland said, in his most gentle\ntone; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand then, if it does not occur to you, we can talk of it some\nother time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, now I remember! They told me something about the poor boy being\nsmitten with some girl of inferior station. Of course, even he would\nhave a little more sense than ever to dream of marrying her. But\nyoung men, although they mean nothing, are apt to say things that\ncost money. And above all others, Hilary may have given some grounds\nfor damages--he is so inconsiderate! Now, if that should be so, and\nthey give a large verdict, as a low-born jury always does against a\nwell-born gentleman, several delicate points arise. In the first place,\nhas he any legal right to fall in love under this settlement? And if\nnot, how can any judgment take effect on his interest? And again, if\nhe should fall in battle, would that stay proceedings? And if all\nthese points should be settled against us, have we any power to raise\nthe money? For I know that you have no money, Roland, except what you\nreceive from land; as under my advice every farthing of accumulation\nhas been laid out in buying back, field by field, portions of our lost\nproperty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my dear mother; and worse than that; every field so purchased\nhas been declared or assured--or whatever they call it--to follow the\ntrusts of this settlement; so that I verily believe if I wanted \u00c2\u00a35000\nfor any urgent family purposes, I must raise it--if at all--upon mere\npersonal security. But surely, dear mother, you cannot find fault with\nthe very efficient manner in which your own desires have been carried\nout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my son, I have acted for the best, and according to your dear\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans. When I married your father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old lady continued,\nwith a soft quiet pride, which was quite her own, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was believed, in\nthe very best quarters, that the Duchess Dowager of Chalcorhin, of whom\nperhaps you may have heard me speak----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly yes, mother, every other day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, my dear son, I have a right to do so of my own godmother, and\ngreat-aunt. The sneering spirit of the present day cannot rob us of all\nour advantages. However, your father (as was right and natural on his\npart) felt a conviction--as those low Methodists are always saying of\nthemselves--that there would be a hundred thousand pounds, to help him\nin what he was thinking of. But her Grace was vexed at my marriage; and\nso, as you know, my dear Roland, I brought the Lorraines nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my dear mother, you brought yourself, and your clear mind, and\nclever management.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you always think that of me, Roland, dear? Whatever happens, when\nI am gone, will you always believe that I did my best?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland was surprised at his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very unusual state of mind.\nAnd he saw how her delicate face was softened from its calm composure.\nAnd the like emotion moved himself; for he was a man of strong feeling,\nthough he deigned so rarely to let it out, and froze it so often with\nfatalism.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dearest mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, bowing his silver hair over her\nsnowy locks, \u00e2\u0080\u009csurely you know me well enough to make such a question\nneedless. A more active and devoted mind never worked for one especial\npurpose--the welfare of those for whose sake you have abandoned show\nand grandeur. Ay, mother, and with as much success as our hereditary\nfaults allowed. Since your labours began, we must have picked up fifty\nacres.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that all you know of it, Roland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Lady Valeria, with a short\nsigh; \u00e2\u0080\u009call my efforts will be thrown away, I greatly fear, when I am\ngone. One hundred and fifty-six acres and a half have been brought back\ninto the Lorraine rent-roll, without even counting the hedge-rows.\nAnd now there are two things to be done, to carry on this great work\nwell. That interloper, Sir Remnant Chapman, a man of comparatively\nmodern race, holds more than two thousand acres of the best and oldest\nLorraine land. He wishes young Alice to marry his son, and proposes a\nvery handsome settlement. Why, Roland, you told me all about it--though\nnot quite as soon as you should have done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not perceive that I neglected my duty. If I did so, surprise must\nhave \u00e2\u0080\u0098knocked me out of time,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as our good Struan expresses it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Hales! Mr. Hales, the clergyman! I cannot imagine what he\ncould mean. But it must have been something low, of course; either\nbadger-baiting, or prize-fighting--though people of really good\nposition have a right to like such things. But now we must let that\npoor stupid Sir Remnant, who cannot even turn a compliment, have his\nown way about silly Alice, for the sake of more important things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear mother, you sometimes try me. What can be more important than\nAlice? And to what overpowering influence is she to be sacrificed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is useless to talk like that, Sir Roland. She must do her best,\nlike everybody else who is not of ignoble family. The girl has plenty\nof pride, and will be the first to perceive the necessity. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twill not\nbe so much for the sake of the settlement, for that of course will go\nwith her; but we must make it a stipulation, and have it set down under\nhand and seal, that Sir Remnant, and after his time his son, shall sell\nto us, at a valuation, any pieces of our own land which we may be able\nto repurchase. Now, Roland, you never would have thought of that. It is\na most admirable plan, is it not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is worthy of your ingenuity, mother. But will Sir Remnant agree to\nit? He is fond of his acres, like all landowners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne acre is as good as another to a man of modern lineage. Some of\nthat land passed from us at the time of the great confiscation, and\nsome was sold by that reckless man, the last Sir Hilary but one. The\nChapmans have held very little of it for even so much as two centuries;\nhow then can they be attached to it? No, no. You must make that\ncondition, Roland, the first and the most essential point. As for the\nsettlement, that is nothing; though of course you will also insist upon\nit. For a girl of Alice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birth and appearance we could easily get a\nlarger settlement and a much higher position, by sending her to London\nfor one season, under Lady de Lampnor. But how would that help us\ntowards getting back the land?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou look so learned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland, smiling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith all those books\nwhich you seem to have mastered, that surely we may employ you to draw\nthe deed for signature by Sir Remnant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have little doubt that I could do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the ancient lady,\nwho took everything as in earnest; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I am not so strong as I was,\nand therefore I wish you to push things forward. I have given up, as\nyou know, my proper attention to many little matters (which go on very\nbadly without me) simply that all my small abilities might be devoted\nto this great purpose. I hope to have still a few years left--but\ntwo things I must see accomplished before I can leave this world in\npeace. Alice must marry Captain Chapman, upon the conditions which I\nhave expressed, and Hilary must marry a fortune, with special clauses\nenabling him to invest it in land upon proper trusts. The boy is\nhandsome enough for anything; and his fame for courage, and his martial\nbearing, and above all his regimentals, will make him irresistible. But\nhe must not stay at the wars too long. It is too great a risk to run.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my dear mother, I must confess that your scheme is a very fine\none. Supposing, I mean, that the object is worth it; of which I am by\nno means sure. I have not made it the purpose of my life to recover\nthe Lorraine estates; I have not toiled and schemed for that end;\nalthough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added with dry irony, which quite escaped his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsense, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is of course a far less exertion to sell one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children,\nwith that view. But there are several hitches in your little plan: for\ninstance, Alice hates Captain Chapman, and Hilary loves a girl without\na penny--though the Grower must have had good markets lately, according\nto the price of vegetables.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clever as Sir Roland was, he made the\nmistake of the outer world: there are no such things as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood markets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice is a mere child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied her grandmother, smiling placidly;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cshe cannot have the smallest idea yet, as to what she likes, or\ndislikes. The Captain is quite as well bred as his father; and he can\ndrive four-in-hand. I wonder that she has shown such presumption, as\neither to like or dislike him. It is your fault, Roland. Perpetual\nindulgence sets children up to such dreadful things; of which they must\nbe broken painfully, having been encouraged so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered, keeping his own opinions to\nhimself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou clearly know how to manage young girls, a great deal\nbetter than I do. Will you talk to Alice (in your own convincing and\nmost eloquent manner) if I send her up to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the greatest pleasure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lady Valeria, having long expected\nthis: \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou may safely leave her to me, I believe. Chits of girls must\nbe taught their place. But I mean to be very quiet with her. Let me\nsee her to-morrow, Roland; I am tired now, and could not manage her,\nwithout more talking than I am fit for. Therefore I will say \u00e2\u0080\u0098good\nevening.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nACHES _v._ ACRES.\n\n\nAlice had \u00e2\u0080\u009cplenty of spirit of her own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which of course she called\n\u00e2\u0080\u009csense of dignity;\u00e2\u0080\u009d but in spite of it all, she was most unwilling to\nencounter her valiant grandmother. And she knew that this encounter was\nannounced the moment she was sent for.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs my hair right? Are my bows right? Has the old dog left any\npaw-marks on me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked herself; but would rather have died--as\nin her quick way she said to herself--than have confessed her fright\nby asking any of the maids to tell her. Betwixt herself and her\ngrandmother there was little love lost, and still less kept; for\neach looked down upon the other from the heights of impartial duty.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA flighty, romantic, unfledged girl, with no deference towards her\nsuperiors\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cA cold-blooded, crafty, plotting old woman, without a bit\nof faith in any one;\u00e2\u0080\u009d--thus each would have seen the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image, if\nshe had looked into her own mind, and faced its impressions honestly.\n\nThe elder lady, having cares of her own, contrived for the most part to\ndo very well without seeing much of her grandchild; who on the other\nhand was quite resigned to the affliction of this absence. But Alice\ncould never perceive the justice of the reproaches wherewith she was\nmet, whenever she came, for not having come more often where she was\nnot wanted.\n\nNow with all her courage ready, and not a sign in eye, face, or\nbearing, of the disquietude all the while fluttering in the shadow of\nher heart, the young lady looked at the ancient lady respectfully,\nand saluted her. Two fairer types of youth and age, of innocence and\nexperience, of maiden grace and matron dignity, scarcely need be sought\nfor; and the resemblance of their features heightened the contrast of\nage and character. A sculptor might have been pleased to reckon the\npoints of beauty inherited by the maiden from the matron--the slim\nround neck, the graceful carriage of the well-shaped head, the elliptic\narch of brow, the broad yet softly-moulded forehead, as well as the\nstraight nose and delicate chin--a strong resemblance of details, but\nin the expression of the whole an even stronger difference. For Alice,\nbesides the bright play of youth and all its glistening carelessness,\nwas gifted with a kinder and larger nature than her grandmother. And as\na kind, large-fruited tree, to all who understand it, shows--even by\nits bark and foliage and the expression of its growth--the vigour of\nthe virtue in it, and liberality of its juice; so a fine sweet human\nnature breathes and shines in the outer aspect, brightens the glance,\nand enriches the smile, and makes the whole creature charming.\n\nBut Alice, though blest with this very nice manner of contemplating\nhumanity, was quite unable to bring it to bear upon the countenance of\nher grandmother. We all know how the very best benevolence perpetually\nis pulled up short; and even the turn of a word, or a look, or a breath\nof air with a chill in it scatters fine ideas into corners out of\nharmony.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may take a chair, my dear, if you please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lady Valeria,\ngraciously; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou seem to be rather pale to-day. I hope you have not\ntaken anything likely to disagree with you. If you have, there is still\na little drop left of my famous ginger cordial. You make a face! That\nis not becoming. You must get over those childish tricks. You are--let\nme see, how old are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeventeen years and a half, madam; about last Wednesday fortnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is always good to be accurate, Alice. \u00e2\u0080\u0098About\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a very loose word\nindeed. It may have been either that day or another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must have been either that day or some other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, gravely\ncurtsying.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou inherit this catchword style from your father. I pass it over, as\nyou are so young. But the sooner you leave it off, the better. There\nare many things now that you must leave off. For instance, you must not\npretend to be witty. It is not in our family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not suppose that it was, grandmother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere used to be some wit, when I was young, but none of it has\ndescended. There is nothing more fatal to a young girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prospects than\na sad ambition for jesting. And it is concerning your prospects now,\nthat I wish to advise you kindly. I hear from your father a very sad\nthing--that you receive with ingratitude the plans which we have formed\nfor you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father has not told me of any plans at all about me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe may not have told you; but you know them well. Consulting your\nown welfare and the interest of the family, we have resolved that you\nshould at once receive the addresses of Captain Chapman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot be so cruel, I am sure. Or if you are, my father cannot. I\nwould sooner die than so degrade myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung girls always talk like that when their fancy does not happen\nto be caught. When, however, that is the case, they care not how they\ndegrade themselves. This throws upon their elders the duty of judging\nand deciding for them, as to what will conduce to their happiness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo hear Captain Chapman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name alone conduces to my misery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg you, Alice, to explain what you mean. Your expressions are\nstrong; and I am not sure that they are altogether respectful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean them to be quite respectful, grandmother; and I do not mean\nthem to be too strong. Indeed I should despair of making them so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are very provoking. Will you kindly state your objections to\nCaptain Chapman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlice for the first time dropped her eyes under the old lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsteadfast gaze. She felt that her intuition was right, but she could\nnot put it into words.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it his appearance, may I ask? Is he too short for your ideal? Are\nhis eyes too small, and his hair too thin? Does he slouch in walking,\nand turn his toes in? Is it any trumpery of that sort?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Lady\nValeria, though in her heart such things were not scored as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrumpery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere such things trumpery when you were young?\u00e2\u0080\u009d her grandchild longed\nto ask, but duty and good training checked her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis appearance is bad enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I do not attach much\nimportance to that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs if I believed it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Lady Valeria.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen what is it that proves fatal to him in your sagacious judgment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg you as a favour not to ask me, madam. I cannot--I cannot explain\nto you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNonsense, child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old lady smiling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would not be so\nabsurd if you had only seen a little good society. If you are so\nbashful, you may look away; but at any rate you must tell me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it is this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the maiden answered, with her grey eyes full on her\ngrandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and a rich blush adding to their lustre: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain\nChapman is not what I call a good man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn what way? How? What have you heard against him? If he is not\nperfect, you can make him so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever, never! He is a very bad man. He despises all women; and he--he\nlooks--he stares quite insolently--even at me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, this is a little too good, I declare!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed her\ngrandmother, with as loud a laugh as good breeding ever indulges in.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear child, you must go to London; you must be presented at Court;\nyou must learn a little of the ways of the world; and see the first\ngentleman in Europe. How his Royal Highness will laugh, to be sure! I\nshall send him the story through Lady de Lampnor, that a young lady\nhates and abhors her intended, because he even ventures to look at her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot understand me, madam. And I will not pretend to argue with\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should hope not indeed. If we spread this story at the beginning of\nthe season, and have you presented while it is fresh, we may save you,\neven yet, from your monster, perhaps. There will be such eagerness to\nbehold you, simply because you must not be looked at, that everybody\nwill be at your feet, all closing their eyes for your sake, I should\nhope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlice was a very sweet-tempered girl; but all the contempt with which\nin her heart she unconsciously regarded her grandmother was scarcely\nenough to keep her from flashing forth at this common raillery. Large\ntears of pride and injured delicacy formed in her eyes, but she held\nthem in; only asking with a curtsy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I go now, if you please?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, you may go. You have done quite enough. You have made\nme laugh so that I want my tea. Only remember one serious thing--the\ninterest of the family requires that you should soon learn to be looked\nat. You must begin to take lessons at once. Within six months you must\nbe engaged, and within twelve months you must be married to Captain\nStephen Chapman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI trow not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice to herself, as with another curtsy, and a\nshudder, she retreated.\n\nBut she had not long been sitting by herself, and feeling the\nbitterness of defeat, before she determined, with womanly wit, to have\na triumph somewhere; so she ran at once to her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room, and he\nof course was at home to her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you please, dear papa, you must shut\nyour books, and you must come into this great chair, and you must not\nshut even one of your eyes, but listen in the most respectful manner to\nall I have to say to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat must be must. You are\na thorough tyrant. The days are certainly getting longer; but they\nscarcely seem to be long enough for you to torment your father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo candles, papa, if you please, as yet. What I have to say can be\nsaid in the dark, and that will enable you to look at me, papa, which\notherwise you could scarcely do. Is it true that you are plotting to\nmarry me to that odious Captain Chapman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland began to think what to say; for his better nature often told\nhim to wash his hands of this loathsome scheme.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you so tired of me already,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the quick girl, with sound of\ntears in her voice; \u00e2\u0080\u009chave I behaved so very badly, and shown so little\nlove for you, that you want to kill me so very soon, father?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice, come Alice, you know how I love you; and that all that I care\nfor is your own good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd are we so utterly different, papa, in our tastes, and perceptions,\nand principles, that you can ever dream that it is good for me to marry\nMr. Chapman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my dear, he is a very nice man, quiet, and gentle, and kind to\nevery one, and most attentive to his father. He could place you in a\nvery good position, Alice; and you would still be near me. Also, there\nare other reasons making it desirable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat other reasons, papa, may I know? Something about land, I suppose.\nLand is at the bottom of every mischief.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou desperate little radical! Well, I will confess that land has a\ngood deal to do with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, am I worth twenty acres to you? Tell the truth now, am I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy darling, you are so very foolish. How can you ask such a question!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, am I worth fifty? Come now, am I worth as much as fifty?\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid now, and say that I am, if you really feel that I am\nnot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many fifties--would you like to know? Come to me, and I will tell\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not yet, papa. There is no kiss for you, unless you say I am worth\na thousand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou little coquette; You keep all your coquetries for your own old\nfather, I do believe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen tell me that I am worth a thousand, father--a thousand acres of\ngood rich land with trees and hedges, and cows and sheep--surely I\nnever can be worth all that: or at any rate not to you, papa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are worth to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland Lorraine--as she fell into his\narms, and sobbed, and kissed him, and stroked his white beard, and\nthen sobbed again--\u00e2\u0080\u009cnot a thousand acres, but ten thousand--land, and\nhearth, and home, and heart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen after all you do love me, father. I call nothing love that loves\nanything else. And how much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, with her arms round his neck,\nand her red lips curving to a crafty whisper--\u00e2\u0080\u009chow much should I be\nworth, if I married a man I despise and dislike? Enough for my grave,\nand no more, papa; just the size of your small book-table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere she fell away, lost in her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms, and for the moment could\nonly sigh, with her lips and eyelids quivering; and Sir Roland watching\nher pale loving face, was inclined to hate his own mother. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall\nmarry no one, my own child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered through her unbraided hair;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cno one whom you do not love dearly, and who is not thoroughly worthy\nof you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I will not marry any one, papa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, with a smile\nreviving; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I do not love any one a bit, papa, except my own father,\nand my own brother; and Uncle Struan, of course, and so on, in an outer\nand milder manner. And as for being worthy of me, I am not worth very\nmuch, I know. Still, if I am worth only half an acre, I must be too\ngood for that Captain Chapman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nIN THE DEADLY BREACH.\n\n\nThe stern and strong will of a single man is a very fine thing for\nweaker men--and still more so for women--to dwell upon. But the stern\nstrong will of a host of men, set upon one purpose, and resolved to\nwin it or die for it, is a power that conquers the powers of earth and\nof nature arrayed against them. The British army was resolved to carry\nby storm Badajos; and their vigorous manner of setting about it, and\nobstinate way of going on with it, overcame at last the strength of all\nthat tried to stand before them.\n\nThis was the more to their credit, because--the worst of all things\nfor a man to get over--even the weather itself was against them.\nNothing makes a deeper depression in the human system than long spite\nof weather does. The sense of luck is still over us all (in spite of\nphilosophy and mathematics), and of all the behaviour of fortune, what\ncomes home to our roofs and hats so impressively as the weather does?\n\nNow, thoroughly as these British men were resolved to get within the\nwall, with equal thoroughness very brave Frenchmen were resolved to\nkeep them out. And these had the weather in their favour; for it is\nan ill wind that blows no one any good; and the rain that rains on\nthe just and unjust seems to have a preference for the latter. Though\nit must be acknowledged in the present case, that having a view to\njustice, a man of equal mind might say there was not too much on either\nside. At any rate, the rain kept raining, for fear of any mistake among\nthem.\n\nMoreover, the moon, between the showers, came out at night, or the sun\nby day--according to the habits of each of them--exactly when they\nwere wanted by the Frenchmen, and not at all by the Englishmen. If an\nEnglishman wanted to work in the dark the moon would get up just behind\nhis back; and muskets, rifles, and cannon itself were trained on him,\nas at a target; and his only chance was to fall flat on his stomach,\nand shrink back like a toad in a bed of strawberries. And this made us\neager to advance, _per contra_.\n\nAnd after being shot at for a length of time, almost every man one\ncan meet with desires to have his turn of shooting. Not for the sake\nof revenge, or anything low at all in that way; but simply from that\nlove of fairness which lies hidden--too deep sometimes--somewhere or\nother in all of us. We are anxious to do, one to another, as the others\ndesire to do to us; and till we come to a different condition, men must\nshoot and be shot at.\n\nAll these peaceable distinctions, and regards of right and wrong, were\nutterly useless and out of place in front of the walls of Badajos.\nRight or wrong, the place must be taken; and this was the third time of\ntrying it. Fury, frenzy, rushing slaughter, and death (that lies still\nwhen the heat is over), who can take and tell them truly; and if he\ncould, who would like to do it, or who would thank him to hear of it?\n\nAll the British army knew that the assault was to be made that night;\nand the Frenchmen, as appeared by-and-by, knew right well what was\ncoming. For when the April sun went down in the brightest azure of all\nblue skies, a hush of wonder and of waiting fell and lay upon all the\nscene.\n\nThe English now were grown to be what they always grow to be with much\nfighting--solid in their ways, and (according to the nature of things)\nhot or cool with discipline, square in their manner of coming up, and\nhard to be sent back again, certain sure of their strength to conquer,\nand ready to charge the devil himself if he had the courage to wait\nfor them. They were under a man who knew how to lead them, and trusted\nthem to follow him; their blood was stirred without grand harangues or\nmelo-dramatic eloquence.\n\nEvery man in that solid army knew his own work, and meant to do it,\nshoulder to shoulder, with rival hardihood and contagious scorn of\ndeath.\n\nThe walls were higher and the approach much harder than at Ciudad\nRodrigo; the garrison stronger, and the captain a strenuous and\ningenious warrior. Therefore on the 6th of April, 1812, as the storming\nparties watched the sunset fading along the Guadiana, and the sudden\nfall of night, which scarcely gives a bird time to twitter on his\nroost, they wanted no prophet to tell them how different their number\nwould be to-morrow. But still, as the proper and comforting law of\nhuman nature ordains it, every man thought, or at any rate hoped,\nthat his messmate rather than himself was the one to leave a widow and\norphans by midnight.\n\nHilary Lorraine was now beginning to get used to fighting. At first, in\nspite of all his talk about his sword and so on, blows and bloodshed\nwent against the grain of his kind and gay nature. He even thought, in\nhis fresh aversion at so many corpses, that war was a worse institution\nthan law. That error, however, he was beginning to abjure, through the\npower of custom, aided by two sapient reflections. The first of these\nwas that without much slaughter there can be no real glory--an article\nwhich the young man had now made up his mind to attain; and his other\nwise recollection was that a Frenchman is the natural enemy of the\nhuman race, and must, at all hazards and at any sacrifice of pious\nlives, be extirpated. Moreover, he may have begun to share, by virtue\nof his amiability, the views of his brother-officers, which of course\nwere duly professional. So that this young fellow, upon the whole, was\nas full of fight as the best of them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo man died that night with more glory--yet many died, and there was\nmuch glory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So writes the Thucydides of this war; not about Hilary (as\ngood-luck willed it), but one of his senior officers. And that such a\nsentence should ever have been written, is a thing to think about. With\nall that dash of bright carnage fresh on the page of one who did his\nduty so grandly both with sword and pen, peaceful writers (knowing more\nof sandy commons and the farm-house fagot than of fascines and gabions,\nof capons than of caponni\u00c3\u00a8res, and of shot grapes than of grapeshot)\nwisely may stick to the gardening-knife, or in fiercest moments the\npruning-hook; and have nothing to say to the stark sword-blade.\n\nSuch duty becomes tenfold a pleasure, when the sword-blades not only\nswing overhead or glitter at the unarmed breast; but, bolted into great\nbeams of wood at the most offensive angles, are flashing in the dark at\nthe stomach of a man, like a vast electric porcupine; while bursting\nshells and powder-barrels, and blasts of grapeshot thick as hail\n(drowning curses, shrieks, and wails), sweep the craggy rampart clear,\nor leave only corpses roasting. Such, and worse by a thousandfold than\nwords may render or mind conceive, was the struggle of that awful\nnight at the central breach of Badajos; and here was Hilary Lorraine,\nwounded, spent with fruitless efforts, dashed backward on spikes and\non bayonet-points, trampled under foot, and singed by the beard of a\nsmouldering comrade, yet glad even to lie still for a minute in the\nbreathless depths of exhaustion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll up with me now\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was faintly\nthinking--\u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps my father will be satisfied. Good-bye, dear Alice,\nand darling Mabel--and good night to this poor Hilary!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd here his career--of fame or of shame--must have been over and\ndone with, if he had not already won good-liking among the men of his\ncompany. For one of them with his next step ready to be planted on the\nyoung officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast, caught a view of his face, by the light of a\nfire-ball, stopped short, and stooped over him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlow me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, while likely to be blown into a thousand\npieces; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif this bain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the very young chap as saved me when I wur a\ndropping upon the road. One good turn desarves another. Here, Bob, lend\na hand, my boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA hand! I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lend thee a hinch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Bob; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey be squazing me up\nlike a squatting match.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor while all the front men were thus lying dead, the men from the rear\nwould not stop from shoving, and bodily heaving the others before them,\nas buffaloes rush when they lose their wits. They thrust, every man his\nfront man on the _chevaux de frise_, as if it were a joke, with that\nbitter recklessness of life and readiness to take their own turn at\ndeath which drive in one solid mass all true Britons, and their cousins\nacross the Atlantic, whenever the strong blood is churned within them.\nAnd yet all this time they know what they are about.\n\nAnd so did these two soldiers now. Neither time nor room had they to\nlift poor Hilary out of the bed of shattered granite where he lay, with\nwedged spikes sticking into him. And the two men who wanted to do it\nwere swept by the surge of living bodies upwards. But first they did\nthis--which saved his life--they threw two muskets across him. Loaded\nor empty, they knew not; and of course it could not matter so long as\nthe climbing men (clambering hard to their death) found it readier for\ntheir feet to tread on the bridge of these muskets (piered with blocks\nof granite) than on the ribs of poor Hilary. So the struggle went on;\nand there he lay, and began to peep under other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs.\n\nIn this rather difficult position he failed to make out anything at all\nto satisfy or to please him. Listeners hear little good of themselves,\nand lurking gazers have about the same luck. Not that Hilary was to be\nblamed for lying in this groove, inasmuch as he really had no chance or\neven time to get out of it. A great hulking Yorkshireman (as he turned\nout) had fallen obliquely upon Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bridge, and was difficult to\npush aside, and quite impossible to lift up. He groaned a good deal,\nbut he was not dead--if he had not been a Yorkshireman the one fact\nmight have implied the other, but Yorkshiremen do groan after death:\nhowever, he was not dead; and he keeps a mill on the Swale at this\nminute.\n\nHilary, under these disadvantages, naturally tried to lessen them; and\nthough he was pretty safe where he lay--unless a shell came through the\nYorkshireman, and that would have needed a very strong charge--still he\nbecame discontented. What with the pain of his wound or wounds (for he\nknew to his cost that he had several of them), also the violent thirst\nwhich followed, as well as the ache of his cramped position, and a\npiece of spiked plank that worried him, he began to grow more and more\ndesirous of a little change of air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, my dear sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with his usual courtesy, to the\nYorkshireman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou do not mean to be in my way of course, but the fact\nis that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out of this hole by reason of your incumbency. If\nyou could only, without inconvenience, give a little roll to the right\nor left, you would be in quite as good a position yourself; or if you\nhave grown attached to this particular spot, I would try to replace you\nafterwards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the Yorkshireman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only reply, a grunt of contempt and of\nsurly temper, which plainly meant \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo to--Halifax.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is uncivil of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is getting so hot in\nhere that I shall be forced to retort, I fear, your discourtesy. I beg\nyour pardon a thousand times for making this sharp suggestion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these words he pricked the great son of the north in a sensitive\npart with a loose spike he had found by the light of a French\nfire-ball; whereupon, with a curse, the fellow rolled over, like one of\nhis father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s millstones. Then Hilary crawled from his hole of refuge,\nand stiffly resting on his hand and knees, surveyed the scene of\ncarnage.\n\nThe moon had now risen, and was shining gloomily under a stripe of\nheavy cloud, over the bastion of the Trinidad, and into the channel of\nthe fatal breach, down which the sultry night wind sighed, laden with\ngroans, whenever curses and roar of artillery left room for them. The\nbreach itself was still unstormed, and looked more terrible than ever;\nfor the sword-blades fixed at the top were drenched and reeking to the\nhilt with red, and three had corpses impaled upon them with scarlet\ncoats, gay in the moonlight. The rest, like the jaws of a gorging\ncrocodile, presented their bloody jaggedness, clogged here and there\nwith limbs, or heads, or other parts of soldiers. For the moment the\nBritish had fallen back to the other side of the ravelin, and their\nbugles were sounding for the retreat, while the triumphant French were\nshooting, and shouting \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy enter you not all at Badajos, messieurs? It\nis a good place for the English health. Why enter you not then Badajos?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe sullen Britons answered not, but waited for orders to begin again;\nrecovering breath, and heart, and spirit, and gathering closer to one\nanother, to be sure that anybody was alive. For more than two thousand\nmen lay dead or dying in a space of one hundred yards square. Of the\nsurvivors, every man felt that every other man had done his best--but\nhow about himself? Could he be sure that he never had flinched, nor\neven hung back for a foot or so, nor pushed any other man on to the\nspikes to save himself from going there? And was that cursed fortress\nnever to be taken by any skill or strength? was even Lord Wellington\nwrong for once in setting them to do it? and was it to be said in every\nBritish churchyard that Britons were not of the stuff of their fathers?\n\nSadly thus thinking, but after the manner of our nation not declaring\nit, they were surprised by a burst of light, and a flight of glittering\nstreaks in it. And almost before these came down again, they saw that\nthe murderous _cheval de frise_ had a great gap in its centre. With a\ntrue British cheer, stirring every British heart, out they rushed from\ntheir shelter, and up the dark breach, and into Badajos.\n\nOne form, however, passed first into Badajos with undisputed\nprecedence, because it happened to be close by, when the sword-blades\nrocketed away so. And not only that, but the act of that one had\nenabled the others to follow--an act of valour inspired by luck, and\nincited by bodily anguish.\n\nIt was thus. In the depth of that horrible pause and dejection of the\nassailants, Hilary, getting relieved of his cramp, rose slowly and\nstood in a sheltered spot, to recover himself before running away.\nEverything seemed much against him, so far as he could discover; and no\none with a social turn was there to discuss the position.\n\nMoreover, his wounds were beginning at once to sting him and to stiffen\nhim--a clever arrangement made by nature to teach men not to fight so\nmuch. Nearly mad with pain--which is felt tenfold as much by quick-born\nNormans as by slow-born Dutchmen--he saw a shell fall and roll very\nkindly just between his dragging feet. It carried a very long fusee,\nsticking out of it, at a handsome curve, and steadily spluttering with\nfire, like the tail of a rat, when bad boys have ignited it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor better, for worse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary, talking to himself, even in his\nagony, by the power of habit: \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo into that hole, my friend, and do\nyour utmost there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So much had he been knocked about, that the shell\n(although a light one) was as much as he could stagger with; till he\ndropped it into a shelfy hole, which he had long been looking at, under\nthe baulk of six-inch beam, into which the swords were rivetted. Then\ndown he fell--whether from exhaustion or presence of mind he could\nnever tell. Through the jags of the riven granite he heard the shell in\na smothered way sputtering (like a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdevil\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a wasp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest), and then\nwith a thunderous roar and whiz, and a rush through the air of wood,\nstone, and iron, the Frenchman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deadly bar was burst.\n\nFor a moment Lorraine was so stunned and shaken that all he could\ndo was to stay on the ground; but the shock made one of his wounds\nbleed afresh, and this perhaps revived him. At any rate he arose, and\nfeebly tottered in over the crest of the breach. The soldiers of the\nForty-third and Fifty-second Regiments gave him a cheer as they ran up\nthe steep, while on the part of the enemy not a weapon was levelled at\nhim. This, however, was not from any admiration of his valour--though\nFrenchmen are often most chivalrous foes--but because these heroic\ndefenders at last were compelled to abandon the breaches. Being taken\nin the rear by the Fifth Division, which had forced its way in at San\nVincente, knowing also that the castle had fallen, and seeing their\nmain defence lie shattered, they retired through the town and across\nthe bridge of the Guadiana.\n\nAnd now it is an accursed truth that the men who had been such glorious\nheroes, such good brethren to one another, strong, and grand, and\npitiful turned themselves within half an hour into something lower\nthan the beasts that perish. They proved that the worst of war is\nnot bloodshed, agony, and slow death; not even trampled freedom,\nhatred, tyranny, and treachery. On that same night of heroism,\npatriotism, and grand devotion, the nicest and most amiable vice\nindulged by those very same heroes and devoted patriots, was swinish\nand wallowing drunkenness. Rapine, arson, fury, murder, and outrages\nunspeakable--even their own allies the Spaniards, glad to be quit of\nthe French, and to welcome warmly these deliverers, found bitter cause,\nere sunrise, to lament the British victory.\n\nSo it came to pass that young Lorraine, weak and weary, and vainly\nseeking a surgeon to bind up his wounds, was compelled to fight once\nmore that night, before he could lay him down and rest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nSHERRY SACK.\n\n\nThere would seem to be times, and scenes, and cases, in which human\nnature falls helpless under sudden contamination, a mental outbreak of\nblack murrain, leprosy, or plague. A panic, a superstitious fervour, a\npatriotic or social rush, a rebellion, a \u00e2\u0080\u009crevival\u00e2\u0080\u009d--all of these drive\nmen in masses, like swine down a precipice; but the sack of a large\ntown bloodily stormed is more maddening than all the rest put together.\n\nEven good and steady soldiers caught the taint of villainy. They\nconfessed (when their headaches began to get better) how thoroughly\nashamed they were of themselves, for having been led into crime and\ndebauch by the scamps and the scum of the regiment. Still, at the\nmoment, they were as bad as, or even worse than consistent blackguards;\nbecause they had more strength to rush astray.\n\nHilary knew mankind very little, and only from a gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of\nview; so that when he found, or lost, his way into the great square of\nthe town, he was quite amazed, in his weak state of mind, by the scene\nhe was breaking into. Here, by the light of a blazing bonfire, made\nof costly furniture, he descried Major Clumps, of his regiment, more\nneatly than pleasantly attached to the front door of a large mansion.\nAcross his breast and arms a couple of musket-straps were tightly\nstrained and pegged with bayonets into the timber so firmly that this\nactive officer could not even put foot to the ground. On his head was\na very conspicuous fool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cap made of a copy of a proclamation, with\nthat word in large type above his brows; while a gigantic grenadier,\nas tipsy as a fiddler, was zealously conducting the exhibition, by\nswinging him slowly to and fro, to the tune of Margery Daw, even as\nchildren swing each other on a farm-yard gate. The Major\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fury and the\nviolence of his language may be imagined, but must not be reported.\nHe had always been famous for powers of swearing; but in this case he\noutdid himself, renewing (every moment) and redoubling the grins of all\nspectators.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall swing for this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he screamed to his showman, just as Hilary\ncame up; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall swing for this, you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc., etc.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shwing first, old cock, at any rate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the grenadier answered, with\na graceful sweep of the door and the pendent major.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Lorraine, Lorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the latter, as the arc of his revolution\nbrought him face to face with Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, stop these\nmiscreants--ah, you can do nothing, I see--you are hit badly, my poor\nboy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary to the grenadier, with that persuasive grace\nwhich even the costermongers could not resist; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are much too good\na soldier to make a laughing-stock of a brave British officer. I\ncannot attempt to use force with you, for you are lucky enough to be\nunwounded. Thank God for that, and release your prisoner--remember he\nis not a Frenchman, but a brave and good English major.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these, and perhaps some more solid persuasions, he obtained the\nrelief of his senior officer, who for some moments could scarcely\nspeak, through excitement and exhaustion. But he made signs to Hilary\nthat he had something to say of great importance, and presently led him\ninto a narrow archway.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be vile work done in that house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he contrived at last to\ntell Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe men were bad enough at Rodrigo, but they will be ten\ntimes worse to-night. We are all so scattered about that no man has his\nown officer near him, and he don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care a button for any others. It was\nfor trying to restrain some scoundrels of the Fifth Division that I was\ntreated in that cursed way. Only think how we should feel, Lorraine, if\nour own daughters were exposed so!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got any daughters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, groaning with pain, perhaps\nat the thought. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d drive my sword through any man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart--that\nis to say, if I had got any sword, or any arm to drive it with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His\nsword had been carried away by a grapeshot, and his right arm hung\nloose in a cluster of blood; for he had nothing to bind it up with.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a man, though a wounded man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Major replied, being\ntouched a little by Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength of expression, inasmuch as he had\ntwo nice pretty daughters, out of harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way in England: \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is most\nunlucky that you are hit so hard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is quite my own opinion. However, I can hold out a good bit,\nMajor, for any work that requires no strength.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know where to find any of our own fellows? They would be quite\nready to fight these blackguards; they are very sore about the way\nthose scoundrels stole into the town. We have always been the foremost\nhitherto. Your legs are all right, I suppose, my boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, except that I am a trifle light-headed, and that always\nflies to the legs--or at least we used to say so at Oxford.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind what you said at Oxford. Only mind what you say in Badajos.\nCollect every man you can find of ours. Tell him the Fifth are\nmurdering, robbing, cheating us again, as they did by sneaking in at a\ncorner, and insulting our best officers. Drunk, or sober, bring them\nall. The more our men drink, the more sober they get.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is likely\nenough that officers of the Fifth Division would have thought the same\nparadox of their own men.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot get along at my usual pace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I will do my\nbest. But will not the mischief be done already?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope not. I asked Count Zamora, who seems to be the foremost man of\nthe town, which he thought most of--his wine, or his daughters. And he\nanswered of course as a gentleman must. His cellars contain about 300\nbutts; it will take some time for our men to drink that. And I spread a\nreport of their quality, and a rumour that all the ladies had escaped.\nThe night is hot. All the men will plunge into those vast cellars\nfirst. And when they come up, any sober man will be a match for twenty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a pest that I am so knocked about!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary, quite\nforgetting his pain, in the chivalry of his nature. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMajor, if only\nfor half-an-hour you can hold back the devilry, I will answer for the\nsafety of the household. But beware of fire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need not tell me about that, young man. I have seen this work\nbefore you were born. I shall pick up a cloak and berette, and cork\nmy eyebrows, and be a Spaniard; major-domo, or whatever they call it.\nI can jabber the tongue a bit; enough to go down with English ears. I\nwill be the steward of the cellars, and show them where the best wine\nis; and they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know wine from brandy. And they will not know me, in\ntheir cups, till I order them all into custody. Be quick; there is no\nmore time to lose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary saw that Major Clumps was going to play a very dangerous part;\nfor many of the men had their muskets loaded, and recked not at whom\nthey fired them. However, there was nothing better for it; and so he\nset out upon his own errand, when he ought to have been in hospital.\n\nAt first he was very unfortunate, meeting no men of his own regiment,\nand few even of his own division; for most of them doubtless were\nbusy in the houses, laying hold of everything. But after turning many\ncorners, he luckily hit upon Corporal White of his own company, a very\nsteady man, who knew the importance of keeping sober, at a time of\nnoble plundering. This man was a martinet, in a humble way, but popular\nin the ranks in spite of that; and when he heard of the outrage to a\nmajor of his regiment, and his present danger; and knew that a rich\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family was threatened by rascals of the Fifth Division--he vowed\nthat he would fetch a whole company to the rescue, ere a man could say\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJack Robinson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are not able to go much further, or do\nany more. Round the corner there is a fountain of beautiful spring\nwater, worth all the wines and spirits these fellows are disgracing of\nthemselves with. Ah, I wish I had a glass of good English ale--but that\nis neither here nor there. And for want of that a thirsty man may be\nglad of a drop of this water, sir. And when you have drunk, let it play\non your arm. You have a nasty place, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these words he ran off; and Hilary, following his directions,\nenjoyed the greatest of all the mere bodily joys a man can be blessed\nwith--the slaking of furious thirst with cold delicious crystal water.\nHe drank, and drank, and sighed with rapture, and then began to laugh\nat himself; and yet must have another drink. And then for the moment he\nwas so refreshed, that his wounds were not worth heeding.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go and see what those villains are about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself\nand the pretty Saint Isidore (to whose pure statue bending over the\ngracious water he lifted hat, as a gentleman ought to do); \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\ndrunk of your water, and thank you, Saint; though I have no idea what\nyour name is. Our family was Catholic for five hundred years; and I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why we ever left it off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRub-a-dub, dubbledy, dulluby-dub\u00e2\u0080\u009d--what vowels and dissonants can set\nforth the sound of a very drunken drummer, set upon his mettle to drum\non a drum, whose head he has been drinking from. Having no glasses, and\nhaving no time to study the art of sloping a bottle between the teeth\nwith drainage, they truly had happened on a fine idea. They cracked the\nbottles on the rim of the drum, and put down their mouths and drank\nwell of it. The drum was not so much the worse for this proceeding as\nthey were, because they allowed no time for the liquor to soak into\nthe greasy parchment: but as many as could stand round were there,\nand plenty of others came after them. So that the drumhead never once\nbrimmed over, though so many dozens were cracked on it. No wonder, when\nsuch work was toward, that many a musket-shot rang along the firelit\nstreets of Badajos, and many a brave man who had baffled the fury of\nthe enemy fell dead in the midst of his frolicking.\n\nHilary felt that he had been shot enough, and to spare, already; and\nso, while slowly and painfully plodding his way back to the great\nsquare of the town, from corner to corner he worked a traverse, in\nshelter (wherever the shelter offered) of porch, or pier, or any other\nshadowy folds of the ancient streets. And thus, without any more\ndamage, he returned to the house of the Count of Zamora.\n\nHere he found the main door closely fastened--by the fellows inside, no\ndoubt, to keep their villainous work to themselves--and as the great\nbonfire was burning low, he thought that he might have mistaken the\nhouse, until with his left hand he felt the holes where the bayonets\nhad pegged up the good major. And while he did this, a great roar from\nthe cellars quickened his eagerness to get in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a nice thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe major inside, and no\ngetting at him! Such a choleric man in the power of those scamps! And\nthey cannot take him for a Spaniard long, for he is sure to use strong\nEnglish. And not only Clumps, but the whole of the household at their\nwill and pleasure!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut even while calling in question his superior officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-control,\nhe did not show himself possessed of very wonderful coolness. For\nhearing a rush as of many feet upward from the lower quarters, Hilary\nmade the best of his way to the smouldering bonfire, and seized with\nhis left hand--for his right was useless--a chunk of some fine wood too\nhard to burn (perhaps of the African black-wood, or the bread-fruit\ntree, or brown cassia), and came back with it in a mighty fury, and\ntried to beat the door in. But the door was of ancient chestnut-wood,\nand at his best he could not have hurt it. So now, in his weakness, he\nknocked and knocked; and nobody even heard him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is enough to wear any one out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself, in his poor\ncondition--for the lower the state of a man is, the more he relapses\nupon his nature, and Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nature was to talk to himself--\u00e2\u0080\u009cif I\ncannot get in, like this, I must do something or other, and get in\nsomehow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis would have cost him little trouble in his usual strength and\nactivity. For the tipsy rascals had left wide open a window within\neasy reach from the street to a man sound of limb and vigorous. But\nLorraine, in his present condition, had no small pain and difficulty in\nmaking his way through the opening. This being done at last, he found\nhimself in a dark passage floored with polished timber, upon which he\nslipped and fell.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat an evil omen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, lightly--little imagining how true his\nwords would prove--\u00e2\u0080\u009cto fall upon entering a strange house, even though\nit be by the window. However, I am shaken more than hurt. Goodness\nknows I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to bleed again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFastening again his loosened bandage--for he had bound his arm now\nwith a handkerchief--he listened and heard a great noise moving\nsomewhere in the distance. Nothing can be less satisfactory than to\nhear a great noise, and hearken very steadfastly for its meaning, yet\nnot learn what it can be about, or even where it comes from. Hilary\nlistened, and the noise seemed now to come from one way, and then from\nanother. For the old house was peopled with indolent echoes, lazily\nanswering one another, from corner to corner of passages, like the\nclapping of hands at a banquet. Wherefore Lorraine, being puzzled, went\nonwards, as behoves a young Englishman. And herein instinct served him\nwell--at least as the luck of the moment seemed--for it led him into\nthe main hall, whence niches and arches seemed leading away anywhere\nand everywhere. Hilary here stopped short, and wondered. It was so\ndifferent from an English house; and he could not tell whether he liked\nit or not. There was some light of wax, and some of oil, and some of\nspluttering torches stuck into anything that would hold them, throwing\na fugitive gleam on the floor, where the polish of the marble answered\nit. In other places there were breadths of shadow, wavering, jumping,\nand flickering.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a queer sort of place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is the proper thing\nfor me to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe proper thing for him to do became all at once quite manifest; for\na young girl suddenly sprang into the hall, like a hunted butterfly\ndarting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey cannot catch me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed in Spanish--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are too slow,\nthe intoxicated men. I may always laugh at them. Here I will let them\nhave another chase.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFlitting in and out the shadows, as softly as if she were one of them,\nshe stopped by the side of Hilary Lorraine, in a dark place, without\nseeing him. And he, without footfall, leaned back in a niche, and\ntrembled at being so close to her. For a gleam of faint light glanced\nupon her, and suggested strange wild beauty. For the moment, Hilary\ncould only see glittering abundance of loosened hair, a flash of dark\neyes, and raiment quivering from the quick turn of the form inside. And\nthen he heard short breath, sudden sight, and the soothing sound of a\nfigure settling from a great rush into quietude.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis beats almost everything I ever knew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to himself, quite\nsilently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help her. And she seems to want no help, so far as I\ncan judge. I wonder who she is, and what she would be like by daylight?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBefore he could make up his mind what to do, in a matter beyond\nexperience, a great shout arose in some upstair places, and a shriek\nor two, and a noise of trampling. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHoly Virgin! they have caught\nCamilla!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the young lady at Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe ought to have a\nlittle more of wisdom. Must I peril myself to protect her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Without\nfurther halt to consider that question--swifter than the slow old lamps\ncast shadow, she rushed betwixt pillars, and up a stone stairway. And\nyoung Lorraine, with more pain than prudence, followed as fast as he\ncould get along.\n\nAt the top of the stairs was a broad stone gallery, leading to the\nright and left, and lit as badly as a village street. But Hilary was\nnot long in doubt, for he heard on the right hand a clashing noise,\nand soon descried broken shadows flitting, and felt that roguery was\ngoing on. So he made at his best pace towards it. And here he had not\nfar to seek; for in a large room, hung with pictures, and likely to be\ntoo full of light, the fate of the house was being settled. In spite\nof all drunken stupidity, and the time spent in the wine-cellars, the\nplunderers had found out the inmates, and meant to make prizes of war\nof them. Small wonder that British intervention was not considered\na Godsend, when our allies were treated so. But British soldiers,\nhowever brutal in the times gone by (especially after furious carnage\nhad stirred the worst elements in a man, and ardent liquor fired\nthem), still had one redeeming point, the national love of fair play\nand sport. They had stolen this Spanish gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wines, burned his\nfurniture in the square, and done their best to set his house on fire,\nas long as they thought that he skulked away. But now that they touched\nhis dearer honour, and he came like a man to encounter them, something\nmoved their tipsy hearts to know what he was made of.\n\nMiguel de Montalvan, the Count of Zamora, was made of good stuff,\nas he ought to be, according to his lineage. He was fighting for\nhis children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honour, and he knew how to use a rapier. Two wounded\nroysterers on the floor showed that, though his hair was white, his\narm was not benumbed with age. And now, with his slender Toledo blade,\nhe was holding his own against the bayonet of his third antagonist,\na man of twice his strength and weight--the very same tall grenadier\nwho had pegged Major Clumps to the door of the house, and swung him so\ndespitefully.\n\nAt the further end of the room two young and beautiful ladies stood or\nknelt, in horrible dread and anguish. It was clear at a glance that\nthey were sisters, although they behaved very differently. For one\nwas kneeling in a helpless manner, with streaming eyes, and strained\nhands clasping the feet of a marble crucifix. She had not the courage\nto look at the conflict, but started convulsively from her prayers at\nclash of steel or stamp of foot. The other stood firmly, with her hair\nthrown back, one hand laid on her sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head and the other grasping\na weapon, her lips set hard and her pale cheeks rigid, while her black\neyes never left the face of the man who was striking at her father. At\nthe first glance Hilary knew her to be the brave girl who had escaped\nto the hall, and returned to share her sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fate.\n\nThings cannot be always done chivalrously, or in true heroic fashion.\nFrom among the legs of the reeling Britons (who, with pipes and bottles\nand shouts of applause, were watching the central combat) Hilary\nsnatched up with his left hand a good-sized wine-bag, roughly rent\nat the neck, but still containing a part of its precious charge. The\nrogues had discovered it in the cellar, and guessed that its contents\nwere good. And now, as the owner of the house, hard pressed and unable\nto reach his long-armed foe, was forced to give way, with the point of\nthe bayonet almost entering his breast, and bearing him back on his\ndaughters, Lorraine, with a sweep of his left arm, brought the juicy\nbag down on the back of the head of the noble grenadier. At the blow,\nthe rent opened and discharged a gallon of fine old crusted port and\nbeeswing down the warrior\u00e2\u0080\u0099s locks, and into his eyes, and the nape of\nhis neck. Blinded with wine, and mad with passion, he rushed at his\nnew assailant; but the Count, as he turned, passed his rapier neatly\nbetween the tendons of his right arm. Down fell his musket, and Hilary\nseized it, and pointed it at the owner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast. And now the grenadier\nremembered what he had quite forgotten throughout his encounter with\nthe Spaniard--his musket was loaded, and on the full cock! So he\ndropped (like a grebe or goosander diving), having seen smart practice\nwith skirmishers.\n\nHowever, it must have gone ill with Hilary, as well as the Count and\nhis household, if succour had not come speedily. For the wassailers,\nwho had shown wondrous temper--Mars being lulled on the lap of\nBacchus--suddenly awoke, with equal reason, to wild fury. With much\nreviling, and condemnation of themselves and one another, they formed\nfront (having discipline even in their cups), and bore down the long\nroom upon the enemy.\n\nDrunk as they were, this charge possessed so much of their accustomed\nweight and power, that the Don looked on all as lost, and could only\nstand in front of his daughters. But Hilary, with much presence of\nmind, faced them, as if he were in command, and cried \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalt!\u00e2\u0080\u009d as their\nofficer.\n\nWith one accord they halted, and some of them tumbled down in doing\nit; and before they could form for another charge, or mutiny against\norders, Corporal White, with half a company of his famous regiment,\ntook them in the rear, and smote right and left; and they fled with\nstaggered consciences.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nBENEATH BRIGHT EYES.\n\n\nAs soon as the Count and his daughters knew how much they owed to\nHilary, and saw the weak and wounded plight in which he had laboured\nfor their good, without any loss of time they proved that Spaniards\nare not an ungrateful race. The Count took the young man in his arms,\nas well as he could without hurting him, and kissed him upon either\ncheek; and though the young ladies could not exactly follow their\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s example, they made it clear that it was not want of emotion\nwhich deterred them. They kissed the left hand of the wounded youth,\nand bent over it, and looked at him with eyes so charming and so full\nof exquisite admiration, that Major Clumps, who was lying on the floor\ncorded--and far worse, actually gagged--longed to rap out a great oath;\nbut failed in his struggle to break the commandment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, he is so hurt, my father!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the braver, and if possible, the\nlovelier of the two fair maidens; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou do not heed such things, because\nyou are so free yourself to wound. But the cavalier must be taken to\nbed. See, he is not capable now of standing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor Hilary, now that all danger was past, grew faint; while he scorned\nhimself for doing so in the presence of the ladies.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is to death; it is to death!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the timid damsel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\nshall we do? Oh holy saints! To save us and to have slain himself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe tranquil, Camilla,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Spanish gentleman, kindly, and without\ncontempt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have not shown the spirit of our house; but we cannot\nhelp our natures. Claudia, you are as brave as a man; seek for the good\nwoman Teresina; she has not run away like the rest; she must be hiding\nsomewhere. Camilla, release that other brave senhor. Gentlemen all,\npray allow us to pass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCorporal White drew his men aside, while the Count, concealing his\nown slight wounds, led and supported young Lorraine through a short\npassage, and into a bedroom, dark, and cool, and comfortable. Here he\nlaid him to rest on a couch, and brought cold water, and sponged his\nface. And presently old Teresina came, and moaned, and invoked the\nVirgin a little, and then fell to and pulled all his clothes off, as if\nhe were her daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s baby. And Hilary laughed at her way of working,\nand soothing him like some little pet; so that he almost enjoyed the\npain of the clotted places coming off.\n\nFor after all he had not received--like Brigadier Walker that hot\nevening--twenty-seven wounds of divers sorts; but only five, and two\nbad bruises, enough to divert the attention. If a man has only one\nplace of his body to think about, and to be full of, he is scarcely\nbetter off than a gourmand, or a guest at a Lord Mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dinner.\nBut if he finds himself peppered all over, his attention is not\nover-concentrated, and he finds a new pleasure in backing one hole of\nhis body against another. In the time of the plague this thing was so;\nand so it must be in the times of war.\n\nFrom the crown and climax of human misery, Lorraine (by the grace of\nthe Lord) was spared. No doctor was allowed to come near him. That\nfatal step in the strongest man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life (the step tempting up to the\ndoctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bell), happily in his case was not trodden; for the British\nsurgeons were doing their utmost at amputating dead men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs; while\nSenhor Gines de Passamonte (the only Spanish graduate of medicine in\ngood circles) had been roasted at one of the bonfires, to enable him to\nspeak English. This was a well-meant operation, and proved by no means\na fatal measure; the jack, however, revolved so well, that he went on\nno medical rounds for three months.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenhor, we can no doctor get,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the anxious Count to Hilary,\nhaving made up his mind to plunge into English, of which he had tried\nsome private practice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenhor, what is now to do? I can no more speak\nto please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can speak to please most nobly; I wish that I could speak the\ngrand Hispanic tongue at all, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenhor, you shall. So brave a gentleman never will find bad to teach.\nThe fine Angles way of speaking is to me very strong and good; in one\nyear, two year, three year, sir. Alas! I behold you laughing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCount, it was but a twinge of pain. You possess a great knowledge of\nmy native tongue. But I fear that after such a night as this you will\ncare to cultivate it no more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom what cause? I have intelligence of you. But the thing has itself\notherwise. The Angles are all very good. They incend my goods, and\nthey intoxicate my wines. They are--what you call--well to come. They\nmake battle with me for the Donnas, but fairly, very fairly; and with\nyour valiant assistance I victor them. I have no complaint. Now I make\nadventure to say that you can speak the French tongue. I can do the\nvery same affair, and so can my daughters two. But in this house it\nmust not be. We will speak the Angles until you have intelligence of\nthe Spanish. With your good indulgence, Senhor. Does that recommend\nitself to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExcellently, Count,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary. And then, in spite of pain, he\nadded, with his usual courtesy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have often longed to learn your\nmagnificent language. This opportunity is delightful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have, at this time, too prolonged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Don Miguel answered, with such\na bow as only a Spaniard can make, and a Spaniard only when highly\npleased; \u00e2\u0080\u009csleep, sir, now. The good Teresina will sit always on your\nhead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe good Teresina could not speak a word of any tongue but her own,\nand in that she could do without any answers, if only she might make\nto herself as many as she pleased of them. She saw that Hilary had no\nbones broken, nor even a bullet in his body--so far as she could yet\nmake out--but was sadly hacked about, and worn, and weak with drains of\nbleeding. Therefore what he wanted now was nourishment, cold swathes,\nand sleep; and all of these he obtained abundantly under the care of\nthat good nurse.\n\nMeanwhile, poor Major Clumps (to whom the Count and his daughters owed\nquite as much as they did to young Lorraine) did not by any means\nbecome the object of overpowering gratitude. He was neither wounded,\nnor picturesque; and his services, great as they were, had not been\nrendered in a striking manner. So that although he did his best--as\nmost old officers are inclined to do--to get his deserts attended to,\nhis reward (like theirs) was the unselfish pleasure of seeing inferior\nmerit preferred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, after a preface too powerful to have justice\ndone to it--\u00e2\u0080\u009cof course this is what one must always expect. I get\nbruised, and battered, and laughed at, and swung on a door, and gagged\nand corded, the moment I use a good English word; and then the girls\nfor whose sake I did it, and turned myself into a filthy butler,\nbecause I am not a smart young coxcomb, and my wounds are black instead\nof being red, begad, sir, they treat me as if I had been all my life\ntheir father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s butler!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe loss of his laurels was all the more bitter to the brave and\ncholeric Major, not only because it was always happening--which\nmultiplied it into itself at every single recurrence--but also because\nhe had been rapidly, even for his time of life, subdued by the tender\nand timorous glances of the sweet young Donna Camilla. The greater the\nfright this girl was in, the better it suited her appearance; and when\nshe expected to be immolated (as the least of impending horrors), her\nface was as that of an angel. The Major, although trussed tight with\nwhipcord, and full of an old stocking in his mouth, had enjoyed the\nprivilege of gazing at her while she clasped her crucifix. And that\npicture would abide upon his retentive, stubborn, and honest brain as\nlong as the brain itself abode. He loved an Angelical girl, because his\nlate wife had been slightly Demoniac.\n\nNow, by the time that our British soldiers had finished their sack of\nBadajos--which took them three days, though they did their best--and\nwere beginning to be all laid up (in spite of their iron trim and\ntraining) by their own excesses, Lorraine was able to turn in his\nbed, and to pay a tender heed to things. He began to want some sort\nof change from the never-wearying, but sometimes wearisome, tendence\nof old Teresina, whose rugged face and pointed cap would dwell in his\ndreams for ever. Of course he was most grateful to her, and never\nwould forget her kindness. Still he longed for a sight of somebody\nelse; ugly or beautiful he cared not--only let it be some other face.\nAnd his wish was granted, as generally happened, and sometimes only too\ngraciously.\n\nOur very noble public schools and ancient universities know, and always\nhave known, how to educate young people. From long experience, they\nare well aware that all languages are full of mischief; and a man who\ndesires that element finds it almost wherever he pleases. So that our\nauthorities did well to restrict themselves to the grand old form, and\nthe distance of two thousand years. Hence, as a matter of course, poor\nHilary had not learned, either at school or college, even one irregular\nverb of the fine pervasive and persuasive language of all languages. To\nput it more simply, he could not speak French. In print he could follow\nit, off and on (as most men, with Latin to lead them, can); but from\nlive lips it was gibberish to him, as even at this day it is to nine\nand a half out of ten good Britons.\n\nAnd now, when suddenly a soft rich voice came over his shoulder (just\nturned once more in great disgust from the dreary door) and asked,\nin very good French indeed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you carry yourself, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hilary\nwas at a pinch to answer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost well, a thousand thanks, most well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAnd after this Anglo-Gallic triumph, he rolled on his bandages very\npolitely (in spite of all orders to the contrary) to see who it was,\nand to look at her.\n\nEven in the gloom of the shaded windows, and of his own enfeebled\nsight, he could not help receiving an impression of wondrous beauty--a\nbeauty such as it is not good for any young man to gaze upon, unless he\nis of a purely steadfast heart, and of iron self-control. And Hilary\nwas not of either of these, as himself and his best friends knew too\nwell.\n\nThe Count of Zamora\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger daughter, Claudia de Montalvan, was of\nAndalusian birth, and more than Andalusian beauty. Form, and bloom,\nand brilliant change, and harmony, and contrast, with the charm of\nsoft expression, and the mysterious power of large black eyes--to all\nof these, in perfection, add the subtle grace of high lineage, and the\nwarmth of southern nature, and it must be confessed that the fairest\nEnglish maid, though present in all her beauty, would find a very\ndangerous rival.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI quite forgot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the senhorita, approaching the bed with most\ngraceful movement, and fixing her radiant eyes on poor Hilary--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\nis one thing, sir, that I quite forgot. My good father will not allow\nFrench to be spoken by any child of his. He is so patriotic! What a\npity, since you speak French so well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary took some time to make out this. Then, knowing how barbarous his\naccent was, he weakly endeavoured with his languid eyes to pierce the\ndepth of the Spanish maiden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and learn whether she were laughing at\nhim. Neither then, nor afterwards, when his sight was as keen again as\never, did he succeed in penetrating the dark profundity of those bright\neyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow shall we manage it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young lady continued, dropping her long\ncurved lashes, and slightly flushing under his steadfast gaze. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\ncannot speak the Spanish, I fear, not even so well as the droll old\nsenhor, who makes us laugh so much downstairs. On the contrary, I\ncannot speak the English. But, in spite of that, we must hold converse.\nOtherwise, how shall we ever thank you, and nurse you, and recover you?\nOne thing must be begun at once--can I, without pain, lift your hand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGreat part of this speech was dark to Hilary; but he understood the\nquestion about his hand, and kept the disabled one out of sight, and\nnodded, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOui, senhora.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whereupon, to his great surprise,\nbeautiful Claudia fell on her knees by the side of the couch, caught\nhis left hand in both of hers, and pressed it in the most rapturous\nmanner, ever so many times, to her sweet cool lips. And a large tear,\nsuch as large eyes should shed, gently trickled on each fair cheek, but\nwas cleverly kept from dripping on his hand, because he might not have\nliked it. And then, with her face not far from his, she looked at him\nwith a long soft gaze, and her hair (with the gloss and the colour of\na filbert over the Guadiana) fell from her snowy forehead forward; and\nHilary was done for.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nDONNAS PRAY AND PRACTISE.\n\n\nA sad and sorry task it is to follow the lapse of a fine young fellow,\nfrom the straight line of truth and honour, into the crooked ways\nof shame. Hilary loved Mabel still, with all his better heart and\nsoul; her pure and kind and playful glance, and the music of her true\nvoice, never wholly departed from him. In the hot infatuation to which\n(like many wiser and older men) he could not help but yield himself,\nfrom time to time a sudden pang of remorse and of good love seized\nhim. Keenly alive to manly honour, and to the goodness of womankind,\nhe found himself playing false to both, and he hated himself when\nhe thought of it. But the worst of him was that he did not think\nhabitually and steadfastly; he talked to himself, and he thought of\nhimself, but he very seldom examined himself. He felt that he was a\nvery good fellow, in the main, and meant no harm; and if he set up for\na solid character, who would ever believe him? The world had always\ninsisted upon it that he was only a trifler; and the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion\nis very apt to create what it anticipates. He offered excuses enough\nto himself, as soon as he saw what a wrong he was doing. But the only\nexcuse a good man can accept is the bitterness of his punishment.\n\nThe British army, having exhausted havock to the lees and dregs,\nmarched upon its glorious way, in quest of other towns of our allies\nno less combustible. But many wounded champions were left behind in\nBadajos, quartered on the grateful townsmen, to recover (if they could)\nand rejoin as soon as possible. Lieutenant Lorraine was one of these,\nfrom the necessity of his case; and Major Clumps managed to be another,\nfrom his own necessities. But heavily wounded as he was (by one of Don\nMiguel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughters), the fighting Major would never have got himself\ncertified on the sick-list, unless he had known, from the course of the\nwar, that no battle now was imminent.\n\nRegardless of his Horace, and too regardful of cruel Glycera, more than\ntoo much pined Major Clumps, and would have chanted mournful ditties in\na minor key, if nature had only gifted him with any other note but D.\nBecause his junior shone beyond him, with breach of loyal discipline.\nHe might console himself, however, with the solace offered by the\nsprightly bard--the endless chain of love revolving with links on the\nwrong cog for ever. Major Clumps was in love with Camilla; the saintly\nCamilla declined from him with a tender slope towards Hilary; Hilary\nwent downhill too fast with violent pangs towards Claudia; and Claudia\nrose at the back of the wheel, with her eyes on the distant mountains.\n\nOf all Lorraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pure bodily wounds, the worst (though not the most\npainful, as yet) was a gash in his left side, made by pike, or sword,\nor bayonet, or something of a nasty poignancy. Hilary could give no\naccount of it, when he took it, or where, or how: he regretted deeply\nto have it there; but beyond that he knew nothing. It seemed to have\nbeen suggested cleverly, instead of coarsely slashing down; so far as\na woman who had not spent her youth in dissecting-rooms could judge.\nBut Major Clumps (too old a warrior to lose his head to anything less\nperturbing than a cannon-ball) strenuously refused to believe in\nHilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ignorance about it. He had a bad opinion of young men, and\nbelieved that Hilary had fallen into some scrape of which he was now\nashamed. At the same time, he took care to spread it abroad (for the\nhonour of the regiment) that their young lieutenant had been the first\nto leap on the sword-blades of the breach, even as afterwards he was\nfirst to totter through the gap he made. But now it seemed likely that\neither claim would drop into abeyance, until raked up as a question of\nhistory.\n\nFor the wound in Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side began to show very ugly tokens. It had\nseemed to be going on very nicely for about a fortnight; and Teresina\npraised and thanked the saints, and promised them ten days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wages, in\nthe form of candles. But before her vow was due, or her money getting\nready, the saints (whether making too sure of their candles, or\nhaving no faith in her promises) suddenly struck work, and left this\ngood woman, rags, bottles, and bones, in a miserable way. For violent\ninflammation began to kindle beneath the bandages, and smiles were\nsucceeded by sighs and moaning, and happy sleep by weary tossings and\nlight-headed wakefulness.\n\nBy way of encouraging the patient, Major Clumps came in one day with a\npair of convalescent Britons, and a sheet of paper, and pressed upon\nhim the urgent necessity for making his will; to leave the world with\ncomfort and composure. Hilary smiled, through all his pain, at the\nthought of his having in the world anything but itself to leave; and\nthen he contrived to say, pretty clearly--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMajor, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean to leave the world. And if I must, I have nothing\nbut my blessing to leave behind me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you do more harm than good by going; and none need wish to hurry\nyou. Sergeant Williams, you may go, and so may Private Bodkin. You will\nget no beer in this house, I know; and you have both had wine enough\nalready. Be off! what are you spying for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe two poor soldiers, who had looked forward to getting a trifle for\ntheir marks, glanced at one another sadly, and knowing what the Major\nwas, made off. For ever since the tricks played with him by drunken\nfellows who knew him not, Major Clumps had been dreadful towards every\nsober man of his own regiment. The course of justice never does run\nsmooth.\n\nThis was a thing such as Hilary would have rejoiced to behold, and\nenter into, if he had been free from pain. But gnawing, wearing,\nworrying pain sadly dulls the sense of humour and power of observation.\nYet even pain, and the fear of the grave, with nothing to leave behind\nhim, could not rob him of all perception of a sudden brightness shed\nsoftly over all around. Two lovely maidens were come to pray for him,\nand to scatter his enemies.\n\nClaudia de Montalvan led her gentle and beautiful sister Camilla, to\nthank, once for all, and perhaps to say farewell to, their preserver.\nCamilla, with her sad heart beating tremulously, yet controlled by\nmaiden dignity and shame, followed shyly, fearing deeply that her eyes\nwould tell their tale. And thus, even through the more brilliant beauty\nof her braver sister, the depth of love and pity made her, for the\ntime, more beautiful. Between the two sisters there was but little,\neven for the most careful modeller to perceive, of difference. Each\nhad the purely moulded forehead, and the perfect arch of eyebrow, and\nthe large expressive eyes, well set and clearly cut and shaded; also\nthe other features shaped to the best of all nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience. This\nmade it very nice to notice how distinct their faces were by inner\ndifference of mind and will.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenhor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Claudia to Major Clumps, who could manage to make out\nSpanish; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have heard that he is very ill. We are come to do the\nbest for him. Camilla will pray--it is so good--and I will do anything\nthat may need. But it is not right to detain you longer. The gentlemen\ncannot pray at all, till they are in the holy orders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Major bowed, and grimly smiled at this polite dismissal; and then\nwith a lingering glance at Camilla, stumped away in silence to a proper\nswearing distance.\n\nHis glance might have lingered till dark night fell, before that young\nDonna returned it. All her power of thought or feeling, fearing,\nhoping, or despairing, was gathered into one sad gaze at her guest, her\nsaviour, and her love. Carefully as she had watched him through the\ntime when there was no danger, she had not been allowed by the ancient\nnurse to come near him for the last three days. And even now she had\nbeen content to obey Teresina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders, and to trust in the saints,\nwith her calm sweet faith--the saints who had sent this youth to save\nher--but for her stronger sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDisturb him not, sister, but let him rest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Claudia, whose fair\nbosom never was a prey to gratitude; \u00e2\u0080\u009csee you not how well he lies? If\nwe should happen to cause disturbance, he might roll over, and break\ninto bleeding; and then you could pray for his soul alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSister mine, you do not speak well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Camilla answered, gently; \u00e2\u0080\u009che has\nshed so much blood for us, that he is not likely to bleed more. It is\nnow the want of the blood, and the fever, that will make us mourn for\never. Cavalier, brave cavalier, can you not look up, and muse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary, being thus invoked, though he had no idea what was meant--the\nlanguage being pure Castilian--certainly did look up, and try with very\nbad success to muse. His eyes met kind Camilla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first (because she was\nleaning over him), but in spite of close resemblance, found not what\nthey wanted in them, and wandered on, and met the eyes of Claudia, and\nrested there.\n\nCamilla, with the speed of love outwinging all the wings of thought,\nfelt, like a stab, this absence from her and this presence elsewhere.\nAnd having plenty of inborn pride, as behoved her and became her well,\nshe turned away to go, and leave her sister (who could not pray at all)\nto pray for what seemed to be more her own. And her heart was bitter,\nas she turned away.\n\nClaudia (who cared not one half-real for Hilary, or what became of\nhim; and who never prayed for herself, or told her beads, or did any\nreligious thing) was also ready to go, with a mind relieved of a\nnoxious duty; when her softer, and therefore nobler, sister came back,\nwith her small pride conquered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not a time to dispute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor even to give one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self\nto pray, when violent pain is tearing one. My sister, I have prayed\nfor days, and twice as much by night: and yet everything grows much\nworse, alas! Last night I dreamed a dream of great strangeness. It\nmay have come from my birthday saint. The good Teresina is having her\ndinner; and she always occupies one large hour in that consummation. Do\na thing of courage, sister; you always are so rich in courage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Claudia, smiling; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou seem to have all the\ncourage now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! I have no courage, Claudia. You are laughing at me. But if you\nwould only raise the bandage--I dare not touch the poor cavalier--where\nthe sad inflammation is, that makes him look at you so--it is possible\nthat I could, or perhaps that you could--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCould what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Claudia, who was not of a long-enduring temper;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no fear to touch him; and he seems to be all bandages. There\nnow, is that what you require?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Camilla shuddered as her sister firmly\n(as if she were unswathing a mummy of four thousand years) untied\nTeresina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knots, and laid bare the angry wound, which was eating\nHilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life away. Then a livid virulent gash appeared, banked with\nproud flesh upon either side, and Claudia could not look at it.\n\nBut Camilla gathered the courage often latent in true gentleness,\nand heeded only in her heart how the poor young fellow fell away and\nfainted from the bold exposure, and falling back, thus made his wound\nopen and gape wider.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see it! I see it! I shall save him yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, in feminine\necstasy; and while Claudia thought her mad, she snatched from the chain\nat her zone a little steel implement, often carried by Spanish girls\nfor beauty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake. With dainty skimmings, and the lightest touch, she\ncontrived to get this well inside all the mere outward mischief, and\ndrew out a splinter of rusty iron, and held it up to the light in\ntriumph; and then she went down on her knees and sobbed, but still held\nfast her trophy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it? Let me see!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Claudia, being accustomed to take the\nlead: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaint plague, what is a mere shred like that, to cause so much\nemotion? It may be something the old nurse put there, and so you have\ndone more harm than good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo nurses put pieces of jagged iron into a wound to heal it? It is\npart of a cruel Frenchman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sword. Behold the fangs of it, and the\nvenomous rust! What agony to the poor cavalier! Now sponge his forehead\nwith the vinegar; for you are the best and most welcome nurse. And when\nhe revives show him this, and his courage will soon be renewed to him.\nI can stay here no longer, I feel so faint. I will go to my saint, and\nthank her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen old Teresina returned, and found her patient looking up at\nClaudia, with his wound laid bare, she began to scold and wring her\nhands, and order her visitor out of the room; but the proud young lady\nwould have none of that.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA pretty nurse you are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto leave this in your patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwound! Is this your healing instrument, pray? What will the Count of\nZamora say, when I show him this specimen of your skill? How long will\nhe keep you in this house? Oh blind, demented, gorging, wallowing, and\nmost despicable nurse!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat last word she pronounced with such a bitterness of irony, that\npoor Teresina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portly form and well-fed cheeks shook violently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor\nthe love of all the saints, sweet Donna, do not let my lord know\nthis. The marvellous power of your bright eyes has cast their light\non everything. That poor old I, with these poor members, might have\ngazed and gazed for ever; when lo! the most beautiful and high-born\nlady under heaven appears, and saves the life of the handsome lord that\nloves her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will speak no more upon this matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Claudia answered,\nmagnanimously. And the nurse thenceforth was ready to vow, and Hilary\nonly too glad to believe, that the sorely wounded soldier owed his life\nto a beautiful maiden. And so he did; but not to Claudia.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nAN UNWELCOME ESCORT.\n\n\nAlong the northern brow and bend of the Sussex hills, the winter\nlingers, and the spring wakes slowly. The children of the southern\nslope, towards Worthing and West Tarring, have made their cowslip\nballs, and pranked their hats and hair with blue-bells, before their\nlittle northern cousins have begun to nurse and talk to, and then pull\nto pieces, their cuckoo-pint, and potentilla, dead-nettle, and meadow\ncrowfoot.\n\nThe daffodil that comes and \u00e2\u0080\u009ctakes the winds of March with beauty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhere reserves that charming capture for the early breeze of May; for\nstill the \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack-thorn winter\u00e2\u0080\u009d buffets the folds of chilly April\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncloak, and the hail-fringed mantle of wan sunlight. This is the time\nwhen a man may say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHurrah! Here is summer come at last, I verily do\nbelieve. For goodness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake, wife, give us air, and take those hot\nthings from the children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necks. If you want me, I shall be in the\nbower, having a jolly pipe at last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then by the time all the\nwindows are open, and the little ones are proud to show their necks and\nthe scratches of their pins, in rushes papa, with his coat buttoned\nover, and his pipe put out by hail.\n\nNone the less for all that, the people who like to see things\nmoving--though it be but slowly--have opportunity now of watching small\ndelights that do them good. How trees, and shrubs, and plants, and even\nearth and stone, begin to feel the difference coming over them. How\nlittle points, all black one day, and as hard as the tip of a rook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbill the next time of looking at them, show a little veiny shining.\nAnd then as the people come home from church, and are in their most\nobservant humour, after long confinement, a little child finds a real\nleaf (most likely of an elder-tree), and many young faces crowd around\nit; while the old men, having seen too many springs, plod on and doubt\nthis for a bad one.\n\nMuch of this had been done, with slow advance from Sunday to Sunday,\nand the hedges began to be feathered with green, and the meadows to\ntuft where the good stuff lay, and the corn in the gloss of the sun to\nglisten; when everybody came out of church one Sunday before Pentecost.\nThe church was that which belonged to the Rev. Struan Hales (in his\nown opinion), and so did the congregation, and so did everything,\nexcept the sermon. And now the Rector remained in the vestry, with his\nfavourite daughter Cecil, to help him off with his \u00e2\u0080\u009cacademicals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nto put away his comb.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope your mother will be quick, my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Parson, stooping\nhis broad shoulders, as his daughter tugged at him; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe cannot walk as\nshe used, you know; and for the last half-hour I have been shuddering\nand trembling about our first fore-quarter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw that you were uncomfortable, papa, just as you were giving out\nyour text. You seemed to smell something burning, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExactly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector, gazing with surprise at his clever and\nqueer Cecil. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow how could you tell? I am sure I hope none of the\ncongregation were up to it. But 9_d._ a pound is no joke for the father\nof three hungry daughters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd with a good appetite of his own, papa. Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you how I\nknew it. You have a peculiar way of lifting your nose when the meat\nis too near the fire, as it always is with our new cook; and then you\nlooked out of that round-arched window, as if you expected to see some\nsmoke.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLift my nose, indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Rector; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall lift something\nelse; I shall lift your lips, if you laugh at your poor old father so.\nAnd I never shaved this morning, because of Sir Remnant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dinner-party\nto-morrow. There, what do you think of that, Miss Impudence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh papa, what a shameful beard! You preached about the stubble being\nall burned up; perhaps because you were thinking of our lamb. But I do\ndeclare you have got as much left as Farmer Gate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very largest field.\nBut talking about Sir Remnant, did you see who skulked into church in\nthe middle of the anthem, and sate behind the gallery pillar, in one of\nthe labourers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 free seats?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I did not. You ought to be ashamed of looking about in church so,\nCecil. Nothing escapes you, except the practical application of my\ndoctrine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, papa, now, you must have been stupid, or had your whole mind\nupon our new cook, if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see Captain Chapman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Chapman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector, with something which in any other\nplace would have been profane; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, what in the world could he want\nhere? He never came to hear me; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, papa; nor to hear anything at all. He came to stare at poor Alice\nall the time; and to plague her with his escort home, I fear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe poor child, with that ungodly scamp! Who were in the servants\u00e2\u0080\u0099\npew? I know pretty well; but you are sure to know better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, not even one of the trusty people. Neither the old butler, nor\nMrs. Pipkins, nor even Mrs. Merryjack. Only that conceited \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mister\nTrotman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as he calls himself, and his \u00e2\u0080\u0098under-footman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as he calls the\nlad; and three or four flirty housemaids.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA guinea will send them all round the other way; and then he will\npester Alice all the way back. Run home, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dear, you are very\nquick of foot; and put the lamb back yourself nine inches; and tell Jem\nto saddle Maggie quick as lightning, and put my hunting-crop at the\ngreen gate, and have Maggie there; and let your mother know that sudden\nbusiness calls me away to Coombe Lorraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, papa, you quite frighten me! As if Alice could not take care of\nherself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have seen more of the world than you have, child. Do as I order you,\nand don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t argue. Stop, take the meadow way, to save making any stir in\nthe village. I shall walk slowly, and be at the gate by the time you\nhave the pony there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCecil Hales, without another word, went out of the vestry door to a\nstile leading from the churchyard into a meadow, and thence by an easy\ngap in a hedge she got into the rectory shrubbery.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust my luck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector to himself, as he took to the rambling\nvillage-street, to show himself as usual. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe two things I hate most\nare a row, and the ruin of a good dinner. Hashes and cold meat ever\nsince Wednesday; and now when a real good joint is browning--oh,\nconfound it all!--I quite forgot the asparagus--the first I have cut,\nand as thick as my thumb! Now if I only had Mabel Lovejoy here! I do\nhope they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the sense not to put it on; but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very well\ntell Jem about it; it will look so mollyish. Can I send a note in? Yes,\nI can. The fellow can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read; that is one great comfort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo sooner said than done; he tore out the fly-leaf of his sermon, and\nunder his text, inculcating the duty of Christian vigilance, wrote in\npencil, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever you do, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put on the asparagus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis he committed to the care of Jem; and then grasping his\nhunting-whip steadfastly, he rode up the lane, with Maggie neighing at\nthis unaccustomed excursion. For horses know Sunday as well as men do,\nand a great deal better.\n\nStruan Hales was a somewhat headlong man; as most men of kind heart,\nand quick but not very large understanding, are apt to be. Like most\npeople of strong prejudices, he was also of strong impulses; for the\nlowest form of prejudice is not common--the abstract one, and the\nnegative. His common sense and his knowledge of the world might have\nassured him that Captain Chapman would do nothing to hurt or even\nto offend young Alice. And yet, because he regarded Stephen with\ninveterate dislike, he really did for the moment believe it his duty\nthus to ride after him.\n\nMeanwhile the gallant and elegant captain had done at least one thing\naccording to the Rector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anticipation. By laying a guinea in Trotman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npalm, he had sent all the servants home over the hill, and thus secured\nfor himself a private walk with his charmer along the lane that winds\nso prettily under the high land. Now his dress was enough to win the\nheart of any rustic damsel, and as he passed the cottage-doors, all\nthe children said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh my!\u00e2\u0080\u009d This pleased him greatly, and could not\nhave added less than an inch to his stature and less than a pound to\nthe weight of his heel at each strut. This proves that he was not a\nthorough villain; for thorough villains attach no importance to the\nopinion of children.\n\nUnaware of the enemy in advance, Alice walked through the little\nvillage, with her aunt and two cousins, as usual; and she said\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye\u00e2\u0080\u009d to them at the rectory gate; knowing that they wanted to\nplease her uncle with his early Sunday dinner. Country parsons, unless\nthey are of a highly distinguished order, like to dine at half-past\none very punctually on a Sunday. Throughout the week (when they shoot\nor fish, or ride to hounds, etc.) they manage to retard their hunger\nto five, or even six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. On Sunday it is healthily otherwise. A\nsinking feeling begins to set in, about halfway through the sermon.\nAnd why? In an eloquent period, the parson looks round, to infect his\ncongregation. He forgets for the moment that he is but a unit, while\nhis hearers are an hundredfold. What happens? All humanity is, at\neloquent moments, contagious, sensitive, impressible. A hundred people\nin the church have got their dinner coming on at one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock; they are\nthinking of it, they are dwelling on the subject; and the hundred and\nfirst, the parson himself (without knowing it, very likely, and even\nwhile seven heavens above it) receives the recoil of his own emotions,\nin epidemic appetite.\n\nThat may be all wrong of course, even unsacerdotal, or unscientific\n(until the subject is tabulated); but facts have large bones: and the\nfact stands thus. Alice Lorraine was aware of it, though without scent\nof the reason; so she kissed her aunt and cousins two--Cecil being (as\nhath been seen) in clerical attendance--and lightly went her homeward\nway. She stopped for a minute at Nanny Stilgoe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, to receive the usual\ngrumbling sauced with the inevitable ingratitude. And then, supposing\nthe servants to be no very great distance before her, she took to the\nlonely Ashwood lane with a quick light step, as usual.\n\nPresently she came to a place where the lane dipped suddenly into the\nhollow of a dry old watercourse--the course of the Woeburn, according\nto tradition, if anybody could believe it. There was now not a thread\nof open water: but a little dampness, and a crust of mud, as if some\nunderground duct were anxious to maintain use of its right of way. By\nthe side of the lane, an old oak-trunk (stretched high above the dip,\nand furnished with a broken handrail) showed that there must have been\nsomething to cross; though nobody now could remember it. In this hollow\nlurked the captain, placid and self-contented, and regarding with much\napparent zest a little tuft of forget-me-not.\n\nAlice, though startled for a moment by this unexpected encounter, could\nnot help smiling at the ill-matched brilliance of her suitor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparel.\nHe looked like a smaller but far more costly edition of Mr. Bottler,\nexcept that his waistcoat was of crimson taffety, with a rolling collar\nof lace; and instead of white stockings, he displayed gold-buttoned\nvamplets of orange velvet. Being loth to afford him the encouragement\nof a smile, the young lady turned away her face as she bowed, and with\nno other salutation continued her homeward course, at a pace which\ncertainly was not slower. But Stephen Chapman came forth, and met her\nwith that peculiar gaze which would have been insolent from a more\npowerful man, but as proceeding from a little dandy bore rather the\nimpress of impudence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Lorraine, you will not refuse me the honour of escorting you to\nyour home. This road is lonely. There still are highway men. One was on\nthe Brighton road last week. I took the liberty of thinking, or rather,\nperhaps, I should say of hoping, that you might not altogether object\nto a military escort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are very kind; but I have not the least\nfear; and our servants are not very far away, I know. They have orders\nto keep near me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey must have mistaken your route, I think. I am rather famous\nfor long sight; and I saw the Lorraine livery just now going up the\nfootpath that crosses the hill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlice was much perplexed at this. She by no means enjoyed the prospect\nof a long and secluded walk in the company of this gallant officer. And\nyet her courage would not allow her to retrace her steps, and cross the\nhill; neither could she well affront him so; for much as she disliked\nthis man, she must treat him as any other lady would.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am much obliged to you, Captain Chapman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered as graciously\nas she could; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut really no kind of escort is wanted, either military\nor civilian, in a quiet country road like this, where everybody knows\nme. And perhaps it will be more convenient for you to call on my father\nin the afternoon. He is always glad when you can stay to dinner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, thank you; I must dine at home to-day. I wish to see Sir Roland\nthis morning, if I may. And surely I may accompany you on your way\nhome; now, may I not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered with a little sigh, as there seemed to be no\nhelp for it; but she determined to make the Captain walk at a speed\nwhich should be quite a novelty to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear me, Miss Lorraine! I had no idea that you were such a walker.\nWhy, this must be what we call in the army \u00e2\u0080\u0098double-quick march\u00e2\u0080\u0099 almost.\nToo fast almost to keep the ranks unbroken, when we charge the enemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow very dreadful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice, with a little grimace, which greatly\ncharmed the Captain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I ask you one particular favour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can ask none,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, with his hand laid on his crimson\nwaistcoat; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor to put it more clearly, to ask a favour, is to confer a\ngreater one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow very kind you are! You know that my dear brother Hilary is in the\nthick of very, very sad fighting. And I thought that perhaps you would\nnot mind (as a military escort), describing exactly how you felt when\nfirst you charged the enemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe deuce must be in the girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought the Captain; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand yet she\nlooks so innocent. It can be only an accident. But she is too sharp to\nbe romanced with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Lorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI belonged to the Guards; whose duty\nlies principally at home. I have never been in action.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I understand; then you do not know what a sad thing real fighting\nis. Poor Hilary! We are most anxious about him. We have seen his name\nin the despatches; and we know that he was wounded. But neither he, nor\nMajor Clumps (a brave officer in his regiment) has sent us a line since\nit happened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was first through the breach at Badajos. He has covered himself\nwith glory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, with tears in her eyes; and for a moment she\nliked the Captain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if he has covered himself with wounds, what is\nthe good of the glory?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA most sensible question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chapman answered, and fell once more to\nzero in the opinion of his charmer. With all the contempt that can be\nexpressed by silence, when speech is expected, she kept on so briskly\ntowards Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s castle, that her suitor (who, in spite of all martial\nbearing, walked in the manner of a pigeon) became hard set to keep up\nwith her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe view from this spot is so lovely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must really beg you\nto sit down a little. Surely we need not be in such a hurry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe air is chilly, and I must not loiter. My father has a bad headache\nto-day. That was the reason he was not at church.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen surely he can be in no hurry for his luncheon. I have so many\nthings to say to you. And you really give me quite a pain in my side.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I am so sorry! I beg your pardon. I never could have thought that\nI was doing that. Rest a little, and you will be better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe complaint would have been as a joke passed over, if it had come\nfrom anybody else. But she knew that the Captain was not strong in his\nlungs, or his heart, or anything; therefore she allowed him to sit\ndown, while she stood and gazed back through the Ashwood lane, fringed,\nand arched, and dappled by the fluttering approach of spring.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe beautiful gazing at the beautiful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chapman, with his eyes so\nfixed as to receive his view of the landscape (if at all) by deputy.\nAnd truly his judgment was correct. For Alice, now in perfect health,\nwith all the grace of young vigour and the charm of natural quickness,\nand a lovely face, and calm eyes beaming, not with the bright uncertain\nblue (that flashing charm of poor Hilary), but the grand ash-coloured\ngrey--the tint that deepens with the depth of life, and holds more love\nthan any other--Alice, in a word, was something for a man to look at.\nThe greatest man that ever was born of a woman, and knew what women\nare, as well as what a man is; the only one who ever combined the\nknowledge of both sexes; the one true poet of all ages (compared with\nwhom all other poets are but shallow surfacers), Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most loving\nand best-loved child,--even he would have looked at Alice, with those\nlarge sad loving eyes, and found her good to dwell upon.\n\nThe Captain (though he bore the name of a great and grossly-neglected\npoet) had not in him so much as half a pennyweight of poetry. He looked\nupon Alice as a handsome girl, of good birth and good abilities, who\nmight redeem him from his evil ways, and foster him, and make much of\nhim. He knew that she was far above him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin mind, and views, and all\nthat sort of thing;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he liked her all the more for that, because it\nwould save him trouble.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo let me say a few words to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began, with his most seductive\nand insinuating glance (for he really had fine eyes, as many weak and\nwanton people have); \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are apt to be hard on me, Miss Lorraine,\nwhile all the time my first desire is to please, and serve, and gratify\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are very kind, I am sure, Captain Chapman. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I\nhave done to deserve it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered with a sigh, which relieved him, because he was\nmuch pinched in, as well as a good deal out of breath, for his stays\nwere tighter than the maiden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! Is it possible that you have not\nseen the misery you have caused me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I know that I have been very rude. I have walked too fast for\nyou. I beg your pardon, Captain Chapman. I will not do so any more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not mean that; I assure you, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I would climb the Andes\nor the Himalayas, only to win one smile from you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear that I should smile many times,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, now smiling,\nwickedly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I could only have a telescope--still, I should be so\nsorry for you. They are much worse than the Southdown hills.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, you are laughing at me again! You are so clever, Miss Lorraine;\nyou give me no chance to say anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not clever; I am very stupid. And you always say more than I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, of course--of course I do; until you come to know me. After\nthat, I always listen; because the ladies have more to say. And they\nsay it so much better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, thinking, while the Captain showed his waist,\nas he arose and shook himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit may be so: he may be right; he seems\nto have some very good ideas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He saw that she thought more kindly\nof him; and that his proper course with her was to play humility.\nHe had never known what pure love was; he had lessened his small\ncapacity for it, by his loose and wicked life; but in spite of all\nthat, for the first time Alice began to inspire him with it. This is\na grand revolution in the mind, or the heart, of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cman of pleasure;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nthe result may save him even yet (if a purer nature master him) from\nthat deadliest foe, himself. And the best (or the worst of it) is,\nthat if a kind, and fresh, and warm, and lofty-minded girl believes\nherself to have gained any power of doing good in the body of some low\nreprobate, sweet interest, Christian hankerings, and the feminine love\nof paradoxes, succeed the legitimate disgust. Alice, however, was not\nof a weak, impulsive, and slavish nature. And she wholly disdained this\nStephen Chapman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, I hope that you will not hurry yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to the pensive\ncaptain; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe real hill begins as soon as we are round the corner. I\nmust walk fast, because my father will be looking out for me. Perhaps,\nif you kindly are coming to our house, you would like to come more at\nyour leisure, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStephen Chapman looked at her--not as he used to look, as if she were\nonly a pretty girl to him--but with some new feeling, quite as if he\nwere afraid to answer her. His dull, besotted, and dissolute manner of\nregarding women lay for the moment under a shock; and he wondered what\nhe was about. And none of his stock speeches came to help him--or to\nhurt him--until Alice was round the corner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHolloa, Chapman! what are you about? Why, you look like one of\nBottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pigs, when they run about with their throats cut! Where is my\nniece? What have you been doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Rector drew up his pony sharply;\nand was ready to seize poor Stephen by the throat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need not be in such a hurry, parson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Captain Chapman,\nrecovering himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Lorraine is going up the hill a great deal\nfaster than I can go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know what a dissolute dog you are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Parson, smoking with\nindignation at having spoiled his Sunday dinner, and made a scene, for\nnothing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou forced me to ride after you, sir. What do you mean by\nthis sort of thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Hales, I have no idea what you mean. You seem to be much excited.\nPray oblige me with the reason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reason, indeed! when I know what you are! Two nice good girls,\nas ever lived, you have stolen out of my gallery, sir; and covered my\nparish with shame, sir. And are you fit to come near my niece? I have\nnot told Sir Roland of it, only for your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake; but now I will\ntell him, and quiet as he is, how long do you suppose he will be in\nkicking you down the Coombe, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stephen, having long been proof against righteous\nindignation; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must be well aware, Rector, that the whole of that\nancient scandal was scattered to the winds, and I emerged quite\nblameless.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, I know nothing of the sort. You did what money could\ndo--however, it is some time back; and perhaps I had better have let an\nold story--Camerina--eh, what is it? On the other hand, if only----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRector, you always mean aright, though you may be sometimes\nungenerous. In your magnificent sermon to-day what did you say? Why,\nyou said distinctly, in a voice that came all round the pillars--there\nis mercy for him that repenteth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure I did, and I meant it too; but I meant mercy up above, not\nin my own parish, Stephen. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any mercy in my own parish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us say no more about it, sir; I am not a very young man now, and\nmy great desire is to settle down. I now have the honour of loving your\nniece, as I never loved any one before. And I put it to you in a manly\nway, and as one of my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most valued friends, whether you have\nanything to say against it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean to say that you really want to settle down with Alice! A girl\nof half your age and ten times your power of life! Come, Stephen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir, I know that I am not in as vigorous health as you are.\nYou will walk me down, no doubt, when we come to shoot together on my\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land; but still, all I want is a little repose, and country\nlife, and hunting; a little less of the clubs, and high play, and the\ncompany of the P.R., who makes us pay so hard for his friendship. I\nwish to leave all these bad things--once for all to shake them off--and\nto get a good wife to keep me straight, until my dear father drops off\nat last. And the moment I marry I shall start a new hunt, and cut out\npoor Lord Unicorn, who does not know a foxhound from a beagle. This\ncountry is most shamefully hunted now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is, my dear Stephen; it is, indeed. It puts me to the blush every\ntime I go out. Really there is good sense in what you say. There is\nplenty of room for another pack; and I think I could give you some\nsound advice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should act entirely, sir, by your opinion. Horses I understand\npretty well: but as to hounds, I should never pretend to hold a candle\nto my Uncle Hales.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, my dear boy, I could soon show you the proper way to go to work.\nThe stamp of dog we want is something of this kind----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Rector leaned over Maggie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck, and took the Captain by the\nbutton-hole, and fondly inditing of so good a matter, he delivered\na discourse which was too learned and confidential to be reported\nrashly. And Stephen hearkened so well and wisely, that Mr. Hales\nformed a better opinion than he ever before had held of him, and began\nto doubt whether it might not be a sensible plan in such times as\nthese, to close the ranks of the sober thinkers and knit together all\nwell-affected, stanch, and loyal interests, by an alliance between the\ntwo chief houses of the neighbourhood--the one of long lineage, and the\nother of broad lands; and this would be all the more needful now, if\nHilary was to make a mere love-match.\n\nBut in spite of all wisdom, Mr. Hales was full of strong warm feelings:\nand loving his niece as he did, and despising in his true heart Stephen\nChapman, and having small faith in converted rakes, he resolved to be\nneutral for the present; and so rode home to his dinner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nIN AMONG THE BIG-WIGS.\n\n\nIf any man has any people who ought to care about him, and is not sure\nhow far they exert their minds in his direction, to bring the matter\nto the mark, let him keep deep silence when he is known to be in\ndanger. The test, as human nature goes, is perhaps a trifle hazardous,\nat any rate when tried against that existence of the wiry order which\nis called the masculine; but against the softer and better portion of\nthe human race--the kinder half--whose beauty is the absence of stern\nreason, this bitter test (if strongly urged) is sure to fetch out\nsomething; at least, of course, if no suspicion arises of a touchstone.\nWherefore now there were three persons, all of the better sex, in much\ndiscomfort about Hilary.\n\nOf these, the first was his excellent grandmother, Lady Valeria\nLorraine, whose mind (though fortified with Plowden, and even the\nstrong Fortescue) was much amiss about his being dead, and perhaps\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cincremated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d leaving for evidence not even circumstantial ashes. Proof\nof this, however invalid, would have caused her great distress--for\nshe really loved and was proud of the youth; but the absence of proof,\nand the probability of its perpetual absence (for to prove a man dead\nis to prove a negative, according to recent philosophers), as well as\nthe prospect of complications after the simplest solution, kept this\nadmirable lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever active mind in more activity than was good for it.\n\nThe second of the three who fretted with anxiety and fear, was Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nyoung sister Alice. Proud as she was of birth, and position, and\nspotless honour, and all good things, her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life was more\nprecious to her than any of those worldly matters. She knew that he was\nrash and headlong, too good-natured, and even childish when compared\nwith men of the world. But she loved him all the more for that; and\nbeing herself of a stronger will, had grown (without any sense thereof)\ninto a needful championship and vigilance for his good repute. And\nthis, of course, endeared him more, and made her regard him as a\nmartyr, sinned against, but sinless.\n\nBut of all these three the third was the saddest, and most hard to deal\nwith. Faith in Providence supports the sister, or even the mother of a\nman--whenever there is fair play for it--but it seems to have no _locus\nstandi_ in the heart of his sweetheart. That delicate young apparatus\n(always moving up and down, and as variable as the dewpoint) is ever\nready to do its best, and tells itself so, and consoles itself, and\nthen from reason quoted wholesale, breaks into petty unassorted samples\nof absurdity.\n\nIn this condition, without a dream of jealousy or disloyalty, Mabel\nLovejoy waited long, and wondered, hoped, despaired, and fretted; and\nthen worked hard, and hoped again. She had no one to trust her troubles\nto, no cheerful and consoling voice to argue and grow angry with, and\nprove against it how absurd it was to speak of comfort; and yet to be\nimbibing comfort, even while resenting it. Her mother would not say a\nword, although she often longed to speak, because she thought it wise\nand kind to let the matter die away. While Hilary was present, or at\nany rate in England, Mrs. Lovejoy had yielded to the romance of these\nyoung doings; but now that he was far away, and likely in every weekly\njournal to be returned as killed and buried, the Kentish dame, as a\nsensible woman, preferred the charm of a bird in hand.\n\nOf these there were at least half-a-dozen ensnared and ready to be\ncaged for life, if Mabel would only have them; and two of them could\nnot be persuaded that her nay meant anything; for one possessed the\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yea, and the other that of the father.\n\nThe suitor favoured by Mrs. Lovejoy was a young physician at Maidstone,\nDr. Daniel Calvert, a man of good birth and connections, and having\nprospects of good fortune. The Grower, on the other hand, had now\nfound out the very son-in-law he wanted--Elias Jenkins, a steady young\nfellow, the son of a maltster at Sevenoaks, who had bought all the\nbarley of Old Applewood farm for forty years and upwards. Elias was\nterribly smitten with Mabel, and suddenly found quite a vigorous joy\nin the planting and pruning of fruit-trees, and rode over almost every\nday, throughout both March and April, to take lessons, as he said, in\ngrafting and training pears, and planting cherries, and various other\nbranches of the gentle craft of gardening. Of course the Grower could\ndo no less than offer him dinner, at every visit, in spite of Mrs.\nLovejoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frowns; and Elias, with a smiling face and blushing cheeks,\nwould bring his chair as close as he could to Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and do his best\nin a hearty way to make himself agreeable. And in this he succeeded so\nfar, that his angel did not in the least dislike him; but to think of\nhim twice, after Hilary, was such an insult to all intelligence! The\nmaiden would have liked the maltster a great deal better than she did,\nif only he would have dropped his practice of \u00e2\u0080\u009cpopping the question\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nbefore he left every Saturday afternoon. But he knew that Sunday is a\ndangerous day; and as he could not well come grafting then, he thought\nit safer to keep a place in her thoughts until the Monday.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTry her again, lad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Grower used to say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdds, bobs, my boy,\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run away from her. Young gals must be watched for, and caught\non the hop. If they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say \u00e2\u0080\u0098yes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 before dinner, have at them again\nin the afternoon, and get them into the meadows, and then go on again\nafter supper-time. Some take the courting kindest of a morning, and\nsome at meal-time, and some by the moonlight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir, I have tried her in all sorts of ways, and she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098yes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to one of them. I begin to be tired of Saturdays now. I have a\ngreat mind to try of a Friday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Grower, looking at him, as the author of a great\ndiscovery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure enough now, try on Fridays--market-day, as I am a man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell now, to think of that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Elias; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat a fool I must have\nbeen, to keep on so with Saturday! The mistress goes against me, I\nknow; and that always tells up with the maidens, but I must have\nsomething settled, squire, before next malting season.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall, you shall indeed, my lad; you may take my word for it. That\nonly stands to reason. Shilly-shally is a game I hate; and no daughter\nof mine shall play at it. But I blame you more than her, my boy. You\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to manage them. Take them by the horns. There is nothing\nlike taking them by the horns, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, to be sure; if one only knew the proper way to do it, sir. But\nmissie slips away so quick like; I never can get hold of her. And then\nthe mistress has that fellow Calvert over here, almost every Sunday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Grower, with a knowing wink, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is her little game,\nis it now? That is why she has aches and pains, and such a very sad\nwant of tone, and failure of power in her leaders! Leave it to me,\nlad--that you may--I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon put a stop to that. A pill-grinder at\nApplewood farm indeed! But I did not know you was jealous!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJealous! No, no, sir; I scorn the action. But when there are two, you\nknow, why, it makes it not half so nice for one, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSquire Lovejoy, however, soon discovered that he had been a little too\nconfident in pledging himself to keep the maltster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rival off the\npremises. For Mrs. Lovejoy, being a very resolute woman in a little\nway, at once began to ache all over, and so effectually to groan, that\ninstead of having the doctor once a-week, she was obliged to have\nhim at least three times. And it was not very long before the young\nphysician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice was sought for a still more interesting patient.\n\nFor the daughter and prime delight of the house, the bright\nsweet-tempered Mabel, instead of freshening with the spring, and\nbudding with new roses, began to get pale, and thin, and listless, and\nto want continually to go to church, and not to care about her dinner.\nHer eagerness for divine service, however, could only be gratified on\nSundays: for the practice of reading the prayers to the pillars twelve\ntimes a-week was not yet in vogue. The novelty, therefore, of Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndesire made the symptom all the more alarming; and her father perceived\nthat so strange a case called peremptorily for medical advice. But she,\nfor a long time, did nothing but quote against himself his own opinion\nof the professors of the healing art; while she stoutly denied the\nexistence on her part of any kind of malady. And so, for a while, she\nescaped the doctor.\n\nMeanwhile she was fighting very bravely with deep anxiety and long\nsuspense. And the struggle was the more forlorn, and wearisome, and\nlow-hearted, because she must battle it out in silence, with none to\nsympathize and (worse than that) with everybody condemning her mutely\nfor the conflict. Her father had a true and hearty liking for young\nLorraine, preferring him greatly--so far as mere feeling went--to the\nmaltster. But his views for his daughter were different, and he thought\nit high time that her folly should pass. Her mother, on the other\nhand, would have rejoiced to see her the wife of Hilary; but had long\nmade up her mind that he would never return alive from Spain, and that\nMabel might lose the best years of her life in waiting for a doomed\nsoldier. Gregory Lovejoy alone was likely to side with his sister, for\nthe sake of Lorraine, the friend whom he admired so much; and Gregory\nhad transmitted to her sweet little messages and loving words, till\nthe date of the capture of Badajos. But this one consoler and loyal\nfriend was far away from her all this time, having steadfastly eaten\nhis way to the Bar, and received his lofty vocation. Thereupon Lovejoy\npaid five guineas for his wig, and a guinea for the box thereof, gave\na frugal but pleasant \u00e2\u0080\u009ccall party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and being no way ashamed of his\nnative county, or his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place therein, sturdily shouldered the\nungrateful duties of \u00e2\u0080\u009cjunior,\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the home-circuit. Of course he did\nnot expect a brief, until his round was trodden well; but he never\nfailed to be in court; and his pleasant temper and obliging ways soon\nbegan to win him friends. His mother was delighted with all this; but\nthe franklin grumbled heavily at the bags he had to fill with money, to\nbe scattered, as he verily believed, among the senior lawyers.\n\nNow the summer assizes were held at Maidstone about the beginning of\nJuly; and Gregory had sent word from London, by John Shorne, that he\nmust be there, and would spend one night at home, if his father would\nsend a horse for him, by the time when his duties were over. His duties\nof the day consisted mainly in catering for the bar-mess, and attending\ndiligently thereto; and now he saw the wisdom of the rule which makes\na due course of feeding essential to the legal aspirant. A hundred\nexaminations would never have qualified him for the bar-mess: whereas\na long series of Temple dinners had taught him most thoroughly what to\navoid.\n\nThe Grower was filled with vast delight at the idea of marching into\ncourt, and saying to all the best people of the town, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPray allow me\nto pass, sir. My son is here somewhere, I believe. A fresh-coloured\nbarrister, if you please, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am, with curly hair below his wig. Ah\nyes, there he is! But his lordship is whispering to him, I see; I must\nnot interrupt them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And therefore, although his time might be worth a\ncrown an hour, ere his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fetched a penny, he strove in vain against\nthe temptation to go over and look at Gregory. Before breakfast he\nfidgeted over his fields and was up for being down upon every one--just\nto let them know that this sort of talent is hereditary. His workmen\nwinked at one another and said (as soon as he was gone by) that he must\nhave got out the wrong side of the bed, or else the old lady had been\nrating of him.\n\nHe (in the greatness of his thoughts) strode on, and from time to time\nworked his lips and cast sharp glances at every gate-post, in the glow\nof imaginary speech. He could not feel that his son on the whole was\na cleverer fellow than himself had been; and he played the traitor to\nknife and spade by hankering after gown and wig. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf my father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad only given me the chance I am giving Gregory, what might I\nbe now? One of these same barons as terrify us with their javelins and\ngallows, and sit down with white tippits on. Or if my manners wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ngood enough for that, who could ever keep me from standing up, and\ndefying all the villains for to put me down so long as I spoke justice?\nAnd yet that might happen to be altogether wrong. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a great mind not\nto go over at all. My father was an honest man before me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn this state of mind he sat down to breakfast, bright with reflections\nof Gregory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glory, yet dashed irregularly with doubts of the honesty\nof its origin, till, in quite his old manner, he made up his mind to\nkeep his own council about the thing and ride over to the county town,\nleaving Applewood none the wiser. For John Shorne had orders the night\nbefore to keep his message quiet, which an old market-hand could be\ntrusted to do; and as for the ladies, the Grower was sure that they\nknew much less and cared much less about the assizes than about the\nwashing-day. So he went to his stables about nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, with enough\nof his Sunday raiment on to look well but awake no excitement, and\ntaking a good horse, he trotted away with no other token behind him\nexcept that he might not be home at dinner-time, but might bring a\nstranger to supper perhaps; and they ought to have something roasted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPride,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a general rule, of course, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoeth before a fall;\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pride in the present instance was so kindly and simple, that\nNature waived her favourite law, and stopped fortune from upsetting\nhim. Although when he entered the court he did not find his son in\nconfidential chat with the Lord Chief Justice, nor even in grave\ndeliberation with a grand solicitor, but getting the worst of a\nconflict with an exorbitant fishmonger; and though the townspeople\nwere not scared as much as they should have been by the wisdom of\nGregory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collected front, neither did the latter look a quarter so\nwise as his father; yet a turn of luck put all things right, and even\ndid substantial good. For the Grower at sight of his son was not to\nbe stopped by any doorkeeper, but pushed his way into the circle of\nforensic dignity, and there saluted Gregory with a kiss on the band of\nhis horsehair, and patted him loudly on the back, and challenging with\na quick proud glance the opinions of the bar and bench, exclaimed in a\ngood round Kentish tone--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell done, my boy! Hurrah for Greg! Gentlemen all, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be dashed if\nmy son doth not look about the wisest of all of \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLoud titters ran the horsehair round, and more solid laughter stirred\nthe crowd, while the officers of the court cried \u00e2\u0080\u009cHush!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the Lord\nChief Justice and his learned brother looked at the audacious Grower;\nwhile he, with one hand on each shoulder of his son, gazed around and\nnodded graciously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is this person--this gentleman, I mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Lord Chief\nJustice, correcting himself through courtesy to young Lovejoy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Gregory like a man, though blushing like\nhis sister Mabel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has not seen me for a long time, my lord, and he\nis pleased to see me in this position.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, that I am, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Grower, making his bow with dignity.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could not abide it at first; but his mother--ah, what would she say\nto see him now? Martin Lovejoy, my lord, of Old Applewood farm, very\nmuch at your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Judge was well pleased with this little scene, and kindly glanced\nat Gregory, of whom he had heard as a diligent pupil from his intimate\nfriend Mr. Malahide; and being a man who missed no opportunity--as\nhis present position pretty clearly showed--he said to the gratified\nfranklin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Lovejoy, I shall be glad to see you, if you can spare me\nhalf an hour, after the court has risen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese few words procured two briefs for Gregory at the next assizes,\nand thus set him forth on his legal course; though the Judge of course\nwanted--as the bar knew well--rather to receive than to give advice.\nFor his lordship was building a mansion in Kent, and laying out large\nfruit-gardens, which he meant to stock with best sorts in the autumn;\nand it struck him that a professional grower, such as he knew Mr.\nLovejoy to be, would be far more likely to advise him well, than the\nnurserymen, who commend most abundantly whatever they have in most\nabundance.\n\nWhen the Grower had laid down the law to the Judge upon the subject of\nfruit-trees, and invited him to come and see them in bearing, as soon\nas time allowed of it, he set off in high spirits with his son, who\nhad discharged his duties, but did not dine with his brethren of the\nwig. To do the thing in proper style, a horse was hired for Gregory,\nand they trotted gently, enjoying the evening, along the fairest road\nin England. Mr. Lovejoy was not very quick of perception, and yet it\nstruck him once or twice that his son was not very gay, and did not\nshow much pleasure at coming home; and at last he asked him suddenly--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you thinking of, Greg, my boy? All this learning is as lead\non the brain, as your poor grandfather used to say. A penny for your\nthoughts, my Lord Chief Justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, father, I was not thinking of law-books, nor even of--well, I\nwas thinking of nothing, except poor little Mabel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, John has told you, I suppose, how little she eats, and how\npale she gets. No wonder either, with all the young fellows plaguing\nand pothering after her so. Between you and me, Master Gregory, I hope\nto see her married by the malting-time. Now, mind, she will pay a deal\nof heed to you now that you are a full-blown counsellor: young Jenkins\nis the man, remember; no more about that young dashing Lorraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, father, no more about him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gregory, sadly and submissively.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I had never brought him here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo harm, my son; no harm whatever. That little fancy must be quite\nworn out. Elias is not over bright, as we know; but he is a steady and\nworthy young fellow, and will make her a capital husband.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that is the main point after all--a steadfast man who will\nstick to her. But you must not hurry her, father, now. That would be\nthe very way to spoil it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark to him, hark to him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Grower. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA counsellor with a\nvengeance! The first thing he does is to counsel his father how to\nmanage his own household!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGregory did his best to smile; but the sunset in his eyes showed\nsomething more like the sparkle of a tear; and then they rode on in\nsilence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nHOW TO TAKE BAD TIDINGS.\n\n\nAfter sunset, Mabel Lovejoy went a little way up the lane leading\ntowards the Maidstone road, on the chance of meeting her father. The\nglow of the west glanced back from the trees, and twinkled in the\nhedge-rows, and clustered in the Traveller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Joy, and here and there\nlay calmly waning on patches of mould that suited it. Good birds\nwere looking for their usual roost, to hop in and out, and to talk\nabout it, and to flap their wings and tails, until they should get\nsleepy. But the thrush, the latest songster now, since the riot of the\nnightingale, was cleaning his beak for his evensong; and a cock-robin,\nproud on the top of a pole, was clearing his throat, after feeding his\nyoung--the third family of the season! The bats were waiting for better\nlight; but a great stag-beetle came out of the ivy, treading the air\nperpendicularly, with heavy antlers balanced.\n\nAll these things fluttered in Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart, and made her sad, yet\ntaught her not to dwell too much in sadness. Here were all things\nlarge and good, and going on for a thousand ages, with very little\ndifference. When the cock-robin died, and the thrush was shot, there\nwould be quite enough to come after them. When the leaf that glanced\nthe sunset dropped, the bud for next year would be up in its place.\nEven if the trees went down before the storms of winter, fine young\nsaplings grew between them, and would be glad of their light and air.\nTherefore, Mabel, weary not the ever-changing world with woe.\n\nShe did not reason thus, nor even think at all about it. From time to\ntime she looked, and listened for her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s galloway, and the heavy\ncontent of the summer night shed gentle patience round her. As yet she\nhad no sense of wrong, no thought of love betrayed, nor even any dream\nof fickleness. Hilary was still to her the hero of all chivalry, the\nchampion of the blameless shield, the Bayard of her life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s romance. But\nnow he lay wounded in a barbarous land, perhaps dead, with no lover to\nbury him. The pointed leaves of an old oak rustled, a rabbit ran away\nwith his scut laid down, a weasel from under a root peered out, and the\ndelicate throat of the sensitive girl quivered with bad omens--for she\nhad not the courage of Alice Lorraine.\n\nThrough the slur of the night wind (such as it makes in July only),\nand the random lifting of outer leaves--too thick to be dealt with\nproperly--and the quivering loops of dependent danglers--who really\nhoped that they might sleep at last--and then the fall-away of all\nthings from their interruption to the sweetest of all sweet relapse,\nand the deepest depth of quietude; Mabel heard, through all of these,\nthe lively sound of horses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feet briskly ringing on a rise of ground.\nFor the moment some folly of fancy took her, so that she leaned against\na gate, and would have been glad to get over it. She knew how unfit she\nwas to meet him. At last he was coming, with her father, to her! She\nhad not a thing on fit to look at. And he must have seen such girls in\nSpain! Oh, how cruel of him to come, and take her by surprise so! But\nperhaps after all it was herself, and not her clothes, he would care\nfor. However, let him go on to the house--if she kept well into the\ngate-post--and then she might slip in, and put on her dress--the buff\nfrock he admired so; and if it was much too large in the neck, he would\nknow for whose sake it became so.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! Mabel, Mab, all out here alone; and trying to hide from her own\nbrother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGregory jumped from his horse, and caught her; and even in the waning\nlight was frightened as she looked at him. Then she fell on his neck,\nand kissed and kissed him. Bitter as her disappointment was, it was\nsomething to have so dear a brother; and she had not seen him for so\nlong, and he must have some news of Hilary. He felt her face, all wet\nwith tears, turned up to him over and over again, and he felt how she\ntrembled, and how slim she was, and he knew in a moment what it meant;\nand in his steadfast heart arose something that must have been a deep\noath, but for much deeper sorrow. And then like a man he controlled it\nall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will walk with you, darling, and lead my horse; or, father, perhaps\nyou will take the bridle, and tell mother to be ready for us. Mab is so\nglad to see me that she must not be hurried over it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBless my heart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Grower; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat a heap of gossip you chits of\nchildren always have. And nothing pleases you better than keeping your\nvalued parents in the dark.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith this little grumble he rode on, leading Gregory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horse, and\nshouting back at the corner of the lane, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be long with your\nconfab, children; I have scarcely had a bit to eat to-day, and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhave my supper spoiled for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGregory thought it a very bad sign that Mabel sent no little joke after\nher father, as she used to do. Then he threw his firm arm around her\nwaist, and led her homeward silently. But, even by his touch and step,\nshe knew that there was no good news for her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Gregory, what is it all about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, with one hand on\nhis shoulder, and soft eyes deeply imploring him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must have\nsome message for me at last. It is so long since I had any. He is\nso kind, he would never leave me without any message all this time,\nunless--unless----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is wounded, you know; how can he write?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Gregory, with some\nirony. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUntil he was wounded, how many times did I bring you fifty\nthousand kisses?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it is not that I was thinking of, though I am sure that was very\nnice of him. Ah, you need not be laughing, Gregory dear, as if you\nwould not do the same to Phyllis. But do tell me what you have heard,\ndear brother; I can put up with anything better than doubt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you quite sure of that, darling Mab? Can you make up your mind for\nsome very bad news?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not been used to it, Gregory: I--I have always been so happy.\nIs he dead? Only say that he is not dead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, he is not dead. Sit down a moment, under this old willow, while I\nfetch some water for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot sit down till I know the worst. If he is not dead, he is\ndying of his wounds. Oh my darling Hilary!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is not dying; he is much better, and will soon rejoin his regiment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen why did you frighten me so, for nothing? Oh how cruel it was of\nyou! I really thought I was going to faint--a thing I have never done\nin my life. You bring me the best news in the world, and you spoil it\nby your way of telling it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be in such a hurry, darling. I wish that was all I have to tell\nyou. But you have plenty of pride now, haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know at all, I am sure; but I suppose I am the same as\nother girls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you thought that Lorraine was unworthy of you, you could make up\nyour mind to forget him, I hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never could do such a thing, because I never dream it of Hilary. He\nis my better in every way. From feeling myself unworthy of him, I might\nperhaps try to do without him; but as to forgetting him--never!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot even if he forgot you, Mabel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe cannot do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered proudly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has promised never to\nforget me. And no gentleman ever breaks a promise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen Hilary Lorraine is no gentleman. He has forgotten you; and is\ndeeply in love with a Spanish lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nKind and good brother as he was, he had told his bad news too abruptly\nin his indignation. Mabel looked up faintly at him; and was struck in\nthe heart so that she could not speak. But the first of the tide of a\nsea of tears just moved beneath her eyelids.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, come in to supper, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered Gregory, frightened\nby the silent springs of sorrow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you are not at the table, poor\ndarling, everything will be upside down, and everybody uncomfortable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe spoke like a fool, confounding coarsely her essence and her\ninstincts. And perhaps some little turn of contrast broke the seals\nof anguish. She looked up, and she smiled, to show her proper sense\nof duty; and then (without knowledge of what she did) she pressed her\nright hand to her heart, and leaned on a rail, and fell forward into\na torrent of shameless weeping. She was as a little child once more,\nwhose soul is overwhelmed with woe. And all along the hollow hedges\nwent the voice of sobbing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, do shut up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gregory, when he had borne it as long as a man\ncan bear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the good of it? Mabel, now, I thought you had more\nsense than this. After all, it may be false, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not false; it is what I have felt. You would not have told me,\nif it had been false. It has come from some dreadfully low mean person,\nwho spies him only too accurately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Mabel, you are quite out of yourself. You never did say nasty\nthings. There is nobody spying Lorraine at all. I should doubt if he\nwere worth it. Only it is well known in the regiment (and I had it on\nthe best authority) that he--that he----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat he does what? And is that all your authority! I am beginning to\nlaugh at the whole of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen laugh, my dear Mabel. I wish that you would. It is the true way\nof regarding such things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare say it may be for you great men. And you think that poor women\ncan do the same; when indeed there is nothing to laugh at. I scarcely\nthink that you ought to suggest the idea of laughing, Gregory. The best\nauthority, you said. Is that a thing to laugh at?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, perhaps--perhaps it was not the best authority, after all. It\nwas only two officers of his regiment, who know my friend Capper, who\nlives in chambers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA gentleman living in chambers, indeed, to revile poor Hilary, who has\nbeen through the wall! And two officers of his regiment! Greg, I did\nthink that you had a little more sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it seems to me pretty good evidence, Mabel. Would you rather\nhave them of another regiment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly not. I am very glad that they were of poor Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nregiment; because that proves they were story-tellers. There is not an\nofficer in his own regiment that can help being jealous of him, after\nthe noble things he has done! How dull you must be, not to see it all!\nI must come to the assizes, instead of you. Well, what a cry I have\nhad, for nothing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMabel, you are a noble girl. I am sure you deserve the noblest\nsweetheart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I have got him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mabel, smiling; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him go.\nAnd I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe a single word against him, until he tells me that\nit is true himself. Do you think that he would not have written to me,\neven with the stump of his left hand, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mabel, I am tired of\nyou; Mabel, I have seen prettier girls, and more of my own rank in\nlife; Mabel, you must try to forget me\u00e2\u0080\u0099? When he does that, I shall cry\nin real earnest; and there will be no more Mabel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in to supper, my pet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gregory. And she came in to supper,\nwith her sweet eyes shining.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nINNOCENCE IN NO SENSE.\n\n\nNear the head of a pass of the Sierra Morena, but out of the dusty\ntrack of war, there stood a noble mansion, steadfast from and to\nunknown ages. The Moorish origin, here and there, was boldly manifest\namong Spanish, French, and Italian handiwork, both of repair and\nenlargement. The building must have looked queer at times, with new\nand incongruous elements; but the summer sun and the storms of winter\nhad enforced among them harmony. So that now this ancient castle of\nthe Counts of Zamora was a grand and stately pile in tone, as well as\nheight and amplitude.\n\nThe position also had been chosen well; for it stood near the line\nof the watershed, commanding northward the beautiful valley of the\nGuadiana, and southward the plains of the Guadalquivir; so that, as the\nmorning mists rolled off, the towers of Merida might be seen, and the\nhigh ground above Badajos; while far on the opposite skyline flashed\nthe gilt crosses of Cordova; and sometimes, when the distance lifted, a\nglimpse was afforded of the sunbeams quivering over Seville. And here,\ntowards the latter end of August, 1812, Hilary Lorraine was a guest,\nand all his wishes law--save one.\n\nThe summer had been unusually hot, even for the south of Spain; and\na fifth part of the British army was said to be in hospital. This\nmay have been caused in some degree by their habits of drinking\nand plundering; which even Lord Wellington declared himself unfit\nto cope with. To every division of his army he appointed twenty\nprovost-marshals; whereas two hundred would not have been enough to\nhang these heroes punctually. The patriotic Spaniards also could not\nsee why they should not have some comfort from their native land.\nTherefore they overran it well, with bands of fine fellows of a warlike\ncast, and having strong tendencies towards good things; and these\nwere of much use to the British, not only by stopping the Frenchmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nletters, but also by living at large and gratis, so that the British,\nwho sometimes paid, became white sheep by the side of them.\n\nOne of the fiercest of these Guerillas--or \u00e2\u0080\u009cPartidas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as they called\nthemselves--was the notorious Mina; and for lieutenant he had a man of\nlofty birth, and once good position, a certain Don Alcides d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Alcar, a\nnephew of the Count of Zamora.\n\nThis man had run through every real of a large inheritance, and had\nslain many gentlemen in private brawls; and his country was growing\ntoo hot to hold him, when the French invasion came. The anarchy that\nensued was just the very thing to suit him; and he raised a small band\nof uncertain young fellows, and took to wild life in the mountains.\nAt first they were content to rob weak foreigners without escort; but\nthriving thus and growing stronger, very soon they enlarged their\nviews. And so they improved, from year to year, in every style of\nplunder; and being authorized by the Juntas, and favoured by British\ngenerals, did harm on a large scale to their country; and on a much\nsmaller scale, to the French.\n\nHilary had heard from Camilla much about Alcides d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Alcar; but Claudia\nhad never spoken of him--only blushing proudly when the patriot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name\nwas mentioned. Camilla said that he was a man of extraordinary size\nand valour; enough to frighten anybody, and much too large to please\nher. And here she glanced at Hilary softly, and dropped her eyes, in a\nway to show that he was of the proper size to please her--if he cared\nto know it. He did not care a piastre to know it; but was eager about\nAlcides. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, then, you had better ask Claudia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Camilla replied, with\na sisterly look of very subtle import; and Claudia, with her proud\nwalk, passed, and glanced at them both disdainfully.\n\nNow the victory of Salamanca, and his sorry absence thence, and after\nthat the triumphant entry of the British into Madrid (although they\nwere soon turned out again), began to work in Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, and make\nhim eager to rejoin. Three weeks ago he had been reported almost fit\nto do so, and had been ready to set forth; but Spanish ladies are full\nof subtlety, and Camilla stopped him. A cock of two lustres had been\nslain in some of the outer premises; and old Teresina stole down in\nthe night, and behold, in the morning, the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wound had most\nevidently burst forth again. Hilary was surprised, but could not doubt\nthe testimony of his eyes; neither could the licentiate of medicine now\nattending him.\n\nBut now in the breath of the evening breeze, setting inland from the\nAtlantic, Lorraine was roving for the last time in the grounds of\nMonte Argento. At three in the morning he must set forth, with horses\nprovided by his host, on his journey to head-quarters. The Count was\nknown as a patriotic, wise, and wealthy noble, both of whose sons\nwere fighting bravely in the Spanish army; and through his influence\nLorraine had been left to hospitality instead of hospitals, which in\ntruth had long been overworked. But Major Clumps had returned to his\nduty long ago, with a very sore heart, when he found from the Donna\nCamilla that \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe liked him very much indeed, but could never induce\nherself to love him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With the sharp eye of jealousy, that brave Major\nspied in Hilary the cause of this, and could not be brought to set down\nhis name any more in his letters homeward; or at any rate, not for a\nvery long time.\n\nLorraine, in the calm of this summer evening, with the heat-clouds\nmoving eastward, and the ripple of refreshment softly wooing the\nburdened air, came to a little bower, or rather a natural cove of\nrock and leaf, wherein (as he knew) the two fair sisters loved to\nwatch the eventide weaving hill and glen with shadow, before the\nrapid twilight waned. There was something here that often brought his\nnative Southdowns to his mind, though the foliage was so different.\nInstead of the rich deep gloss of the beech, the silvery stir of the\naspen-tree, and the feathery droop of the graceful birch, here was the\nround monotony of the olive and the lemon-tree, the sombre depth of\nthe ilex, and the rugged lines of the cork-tree, relieved, it is true,\njust here and there by the symmetry of the silver fir, and the elegant\nfan of the palm. But what struck Lorraine, and always irked him under\nthese southern trees and skies, was the way in which the foliage cut\nits outline over sharply; there was none of that hovering softness, and\nsweetly fluctuating margin, by which a tree inspires affection as well\nas admiration.\n\nUnluckily now Lorraine had neither affection nor admiration left for\nthe innocent beauty of nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s works. His passion for Claudia was\nbecome an overwhelming and noxious power--a power that crushed for\nthe time and scattered all his better elements. He had ceased to be\nlight-hearted, and to make the best of everything, to love the smiles\nof children, and to catch a little joke and return it. He had even\nceased to talk to himself, as if his conscience had let him know that\nhe was not fit to be talked to. All the waking hours he passed, in the\nabsence of his charmer, were devoted to the study of Spanish; and he\nbegan to despise his own English tongue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no melody in it, no\nrhythm, no grand sonorous majesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he used to complain; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is like\nits owners, harsh, uncouth, and countrified.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After this, what can any\none do but pity him for his state of mind?\n\nWhether Claudia returned his passion--for such it was rather than true\naffection--was still a very doubtful point, though the most important\nin all the world. Generally she seemed to treat him with a pleased\ncontempt, as if he were a pleasant boy, though several years older than\nherself. Her clear dark eyes were of such a depth that, though she was\nby no means chary of their precious glances, he had never been able to\nreach that inmost light which comes from the very heart. How different\nfrom somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s--of whom he now thought less and less, and vainly\nstrove to think no more, because of the shame that pierced him! But if\nthis Spanish maiden really did not care about him, why did she try, as\nshe clearly did, to conquer and subdue him? Why did she shoot such\nglances at him as Spanish eyes alone can shoot; why bend her graceful\nneck so sweetly, slope her delicate head so gently, showing the ripe\nfirm curve of cheek, and with careless dancings let her raven hair fall\ninto his? Hilary could not imagine why; but poor Camilla knew too well.\nIf ever Camilla felt for a moment the desirability of any one, Claudia\n(with her bolder manners, and more suddenly striking beauty, and less\ndignified love of conquest) might be relied upon to rush in and attract\nthe whole attention.\n\nHilary found these lovely sisters in their little cove of rock, where\nthe hot wind seldom entered through the fringe of hanging frond. They\nhad a clever device of their own for welcoming the Atlantic breeze,\nby means of a silken rope which lifted all the screen of fern, and\ncreeper, and of grey rock-ivy.\n\nNow the screen was up, and the breeze flowed in, meeting a bright rill\nbubbling out (whose fountain was in the living rock), and the clear\nobscurity was lit with forms as bright as poetry. Camilla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comely\nhead had been laid on the bosom of her sister, as if she had made some\nsoft appeal for mercy or indulgence there. And Claudia had been moved\na little, as the glistening of her eyelids showed, and a tender gleam\nin her expression--the one and the only thing required to enrich her\nbrilliant beauty. And thus, without stopping to think, she came up to\nHilary, with a long kind glance, and gave a little sigh, worth more\nthan even that sweet glance to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! dear Captain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in Spanish, which Hilary was quite pat\nwith now; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have been lamenting your brief departure. How shall we\nlive when you are lost?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat cruelty of yourselves to think! The matter of your inquiry should\nbe the chance of my survival.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell said!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou English are not so very stupid after\nall. Why do you not clap your hands, Camilla?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCamilla, being commanded thus, made a weak attempt with her little\npalms; but her heart was down too low for any brisk concussion of flesh\nor air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe, Master Captain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Claudia, throwing herself gracefully\non a white bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hide--shaped as a chair on the slopes of moss--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\nyou are most happy to make your escape from this long and dull\nimprisonment. Behold, how little we have done for you, after all the\nbrave things you have done for us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Camilla, gazing sadly at the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaptain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d who would not\ngaze at her; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is true that we have done but little. Yet, Senhor, we\nmeant our best.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour kindness to me has been wonderful, magnificent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Hilary.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe days I have passed under your benevolence have been the happiest\nof my life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHereupon Camilla turned away, to hide her tenderness of tears. But\nClaudia had no exhibition, except a little smile to hide.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd will you come again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you ever think of us any\nmore, in the scenes of your grand combats, and the fierce delight of\nglory?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it possible for me to forget\u00e2\u0080\u009d--began Hilary, in his noblest\nSpanish--\u00e2\u0080\u009cyour constant care of a poor stranger, your never-fatigued\nattention to him, and thy--thy saving of his life? To thee I owe my\nlife, and will at any moment render it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was a little too much for Camilla, who really had saved him; and\nbeing too young to know how rarely the proper person gets the praise,\nshe gathered up her things to go.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDarling Claudia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can do nothing at all without my\nlittle silver spinetta. This steel thing is so rusty that it fills my\nwork with canker. You know the danger of rusty iron, Claudia; is it not\nso?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is cross,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Claudia, as her sister with gentle dignity left\nthe cove. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can have made her so cross to-day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe saints are good to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hilary answered, little suspecting the\ntruth of the case: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey grant me the chance of saying what I have long\ndesired to say to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo me, Senhor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the maiden, displaying a tremulous glow in\nher long black eyes, and managing to blush divinely, and then in the\nfrankness of her nature caring not to conceal a sigh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt cannot be to\nme, Senhor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo you--to you, of all the worlds, of all the heavens, and all the\nangels!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fervent youth fell upon his knees before his lovely idol,\nand seized the hand she began to press to her evidently bounding heart,\nand drew her towards him, and thought for the moment that she was\nglad to come to him. Then, in his rapture, he stroked aside her loose\nand deliciously fragrant hair, and waited, with all his heart intent,\nfor the priceless glance--to tell him all. But, strongly moved as she\nwas, no doubt, by his impassioned words and touch, and the sympathy of\nyouthful love, she kept her oval eyelids down, as if she feared to let\nhim see the completion of his conquest. Then, as he fain would have\nhad her nearer, and folded in his eager arms, she gently withdrew, and\nturned away; but allowed him to hear one little sob, and to see tears\nirrepressible.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou loveliest of all lovely beings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d began Lorraine, in very decent\nSpanish, such as herself had taught him; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand at the same time, you\nbest and dearest----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStop, Senhor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered, gazing sadly, and then playfully, at\nthis prize of her eyes and slave of her lips; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must not allow you to\nsay so much. You will leave us to-morrow, and forget it all. What is\nthe use of this fugitive dream?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHereupon the young soldier went through the usual protestations of\ntruth, fidelity, devotion, and eternal memory; so thoroughly hurried\nand carried away, that he used in another tongue the words poured forth\nscarcely a year ago to a purer, truer, and nobler love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young Donna now mimicked, in voice and attitude, some\ndeserted one; \u00e2\u0080\u009cto how many beautiful English maidens have these very\nnoble words been used! You cavaliers are all alike. I will say no more\nto you now, brave captain; the proof of truth is not in words, but in\ntrue and devoted actions. You know our proverb--\u00e2\u0080\u0098The cork is noisiest\nwhen it leaves the bottle.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 If you would have me bear you in mind, you\nmust show that you remember me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the cost of my life, of my good repute, of all that I have in the\nworld, or shall have, of everything but my hope of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall remember these words, my captain; and perhaps I shall put them\nto the test some day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She gave him her soft and trembling hand, and\nhe pressed it to his lips, and sought to impress a still more loving\nseal; but she said \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot yet, not yet, oh beloved one!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or whether she\nsaid \u00e2\u0080\u009coh enamoured one!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he could not be quite certain. And before he\ncould do or say anything more, she had passed from his reach, and was\ngliding swiftly under the leafy curtain of that ever-sacred bower. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\nis mine, she is mine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried young Lorraine, as he caught up the velvet\nband of her hair, and covered it with kisses, and then bestowed the\nsame attentions on the white bull-skin, where her form had lain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nloveliest creature ever seen is mine! What can I have done to deserve\nher?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile he lay in the ecstasy of his triumph, the loveliest creature ever\nseen stole swiftly up a rocky path, beset with myrtle and cornel-wood,\nand canopied with climbers. After some intricate turns, and often\nwatching that no one followed her, she came to the door of a little\nhut embosomed in towering chestnut-trees. The door was open, and a\nman of great stature was lounging on a couch too short for his legs,\nand smoking a cigar of proportions more judiciously adapted to his\nown. Near one of his elbows stood a very heavy carbine, and a sword\nthree-quarters of a fathom long; and by his other hand lay a great\npitcher empty and rolled over.\n\nAs the young Donna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s footfall struck his ears, he leaped from his\ncouch, and cocked his gun; then, recognizing the sound, replaced it,\nand stood indolently at his door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt last, you are come then!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with an accent decidedly of the\nnorthern provinces (not inborn, however, but caught from comrades); \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nthought that you meant to let me die of thirst. You forget that I have\nlost the habit of this execrable heat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClaudia looked up at her cousin Don Alcides d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Alcar--or, as he loved to\nbe called, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe great Brigadier\u00e2\u0080\u009d--with a very different gaze from any\npoor Hilary could win of her. To this man alone the entire treasures\nof her heart were open; for him alone her glorious eyes no longer\nsparkled, flashed, or played with insincere allurements; but beamed and\nshone with depths of light, and profusion of profoundest love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDarling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as she stood on tiptoe, and sweetly pacified him;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have laboured in vain to come sooner to you. Your commands took a\nlong time to execute. You men can scarcely understand such things. And\nthat tiresome Camilla hung about me; I thought my occasion would never\narrive. But all has gone well: he is my slave for ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou did not allow him to embrace you, I trust?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Before he could finish\nhis scowl, she stopped his mouth, and reassured him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it to be imagined? A miserable shaveling Briton!\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, though she\nlooked so indignant, she knew how near she had been to that ignominy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are as clever as you are lovely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Brigadier,\nwell pleased. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I die of thirst, my beloved one. Fly swiftly to\nTeresina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s store; for I dare not venture till the night has fallen.\nWould that you could manage your father, as you wind those striplings\nround your spindle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor the Count of Zamora had given orders that his precious nephew\nshould be shot, if ever found upon land of his. So Claudia took the\nempty pitcher to fetch another half-skin of wine, as well as some\nfood, for the great Brigadier; and, having performed this duty, met\nthe infatuated Hilary, for the last time, at her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board. She\nwished him good night, and good-bye, with a glance of deep meaning and\nkind encouragement; while the fair Camilla bent over his hand, and then\ndeparted to her chamber, with full eyes and an empty heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nHARD RIDING AND HARD READING.\n\n\nIn those old times of heavy pounding, scanty food, and great hardihood,\nwhen war was not accounted yet as one of the exact sciences, and\nsoldiers slept, in all sorts of weather, without so much as a blanket\nround them, much less a snug tent overhead, the duties of the different\nbranches of the service were not quite so distinct as they are now.\nLieutenant Lorraine--for the ladies had given over-rapid promotion\nwhen they called him their \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrave captain\u00e2\u0080\u009d--had not rejoined his\nregiment long before he obtained acknowledgment of his good and gallant\nactions. Having proved that he could sit a horse, see distinctly at\nlong distance, and speak the Spanish language fairly--thanks to the two\nyoung Donnas--and possessed some other accomplishments (which would now\nbe tested by paper work), he received an appointment upon the Staff,\nnot of the Light Division, but at Head-quarters, under the very keen\neyes of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe hero of a hundred fights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIf the brief estimate of his compeers is of any importance to a man\nof powerful genius--as no doubt it must be, by its effect on his\nopportunities--then the Iron Duke, though crowned with good luck (as\neverybody called each triumph of his skill and care), certainly seems\nto have been unlucky as to the date of his birth and work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cProvidence\nin its infinite wisdom\u00e2\u0080\u009d--to use a phrase of the Wesleyans, who claim\nthe great general as of kin to their own courageous founder--produced\nhim at a time, no doubt, when he was uncommonly needful; but when (let\nhim push his fame as he would, by victory after victory) there always\nwas a more gigantic, because a more voracious, glory marching far in\nfront of him. Our great hero never had the chance of terrifying the\nworld by lopping it limb by limb and devouring it; and as noble glory\nis the child of terror (begotten upon it by violence), the fame of\nWellington could never vie with Napoleon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glory.\n\nTo him, however, this mattered little, except that it often impaired\nhis means of discharging his duty thoroughly. His present duty was to\nclear the Peninsula of Frenchmen; and this he would perhaps have done\nin a quarter of the time it cost, if his own country had only shown due\nfaith in his abilities. But the grandeur of his name grew slowly (as\nthe fame of Marcellus grew), like a tree in the hidden lapse of time;\nand perhaps no other general ever won so many victories, before his\ncountry began to dream that he could be victorious.\n\nNow this great man was little, if at all, inferior to his mighty rival\nin that prime necessity of a commander--insight into his material. He\nmade a point of learning exactly what each of his officers was fit\nfor; and he seldom failed, in all his warfare, to put the \u00e2\u0080\u009cright man\nin the right place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He saw at a glance that Lieutenant Lorraine was a\ngallant and chivalrous young fellow, active and clever in his way, and\nlikely to be very useful on the Staff after a little training. And so\nmany young aids had fallen lately, or were upon the sick-list, that the\nquartermaster-general was delighted with a recruit so quick and zealous\nas Hilary soon proved himself. And after a few lessons in his duties,\nhe set him to work with might and main to improve his knowledge of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ccolloquial French.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith this Lorraine, having gift of tongues, began to grow duly\nfamiliar; and the more so perhaps because his knowledge of \u00e2\u0080\u009cepistolary\nEnglish\u00e2\u0080\u009d afforded him very little pleasure just now. For all his good\nprinciples and kind feelings must have felt rude shock and shame, when\nhe read three letters from England which reached him on the very same\nday at Valladolid. The first was from his Uncle Struan; and after\nmaking every allowance for the Rector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s want of exercise in the month\nof August, Hilary (having perhaps a little too much exercise himself)\ncould not help feeling that the tone was scarcely so hearty as usual.\nThe letter was mainly as follows:--\n\n                                     \u00e2\u0080\u009cWest Lorraine, 20th August, 1812.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMY DEAR NEPHEW,\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour father and myself have not been favoured with any letters\n    from you for a period of several months. It appears to me that\n    this is neither dutiful nor affectionate; although we know that\n    you have been wounded, which increased our anxiety. You may\n    have been too bad to write, and I wish to make all allowance\n    for you. But where there is a will there is a way. When I was\n    at Oxford, few men perhaps in all the University felt more\n    distaste than I did for original Latin composition. Yet every\n    Saturday when we went to the hall to get our battelbills--there\n    was my essay, neatly written, and of sound Latinity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\n    come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Lorraine; this is a little too cool, my dear\n    uncle. How many times have I heard you boast what you used to\n    pay your scout\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son per line!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot expect any young man, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the\n    worthy parson, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto make such efforts for conscience\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake as\n    in my young days were made cheerfully. But this indolence and\n    dislike of the pen _furc\u00c3\u00a2 expellendum est_--must be expelled\n    with a knife and fork. Perhaps you will scarcely care to hear\n    that your aunt and cousins are doing well. After your exploits\n    your memory seems to have grown very short of poor folk in old\n    England. Your birthday falling on a Sunday this year, I took\n    occasion to allude in the course of my sermon to a mural crown,\n    of which I remember to have heard at school. Nobody knew what I\n    meant; but many were more affected than if they did. But, after\n    all, it requires, to my mind, quite as much courage, and more\n    skill, to take a dry wall properly, when nobody has been over\n    it, than to scramble into Badajos. Alice will write to you by\n    this post, and tell you all the gossip of the sad old house, if\n    there is any. There seems to be nobody now with life enough to\n    make much gossip. And all that we hear is about Captain Chapman\n    (who means to have Alice), and about yourself.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout you it is said, though I cannot believe it, and must\n    be ashamed of you when I do so, that you are making a fool of\n    yourself with a Spanish lady of birth and position, but a rank,\n    idolatrous, bigoted Papist! The Lorraines have been always\n    sadly heterodox in religious matters, from age to age receiving\n    every whim they came across of. They have taken to astrology,\n    Mahomet, destiny, and the gods of Greece, and they never seem\n    to know when to stop. The only true Church, the Church of\n    England, never has any hold of them; and if you should marry a\n    Papist, Hilary, it would be a judgment.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour father, perhaps, would be very glad of any looseness of\n    mind and sense, that might have the power to lead you astray\n    from my ideas of honour. I have had a little explanation with\n    him; in the course of which, as he used stronger language\n    than I at all approve of, I ventured to remind him that\n    from the very outset I had charged him with what I call this\n    low intention, this design of working upon your fickle and\n    capricious temper, to make you act dishonourably. Your poor\n    father was much annoyed at this home-truth, and became so\n    violent, and used such unbecoming language, that I thought it\n    the most clerical course to leave him to reflect upon it. On\n    the following Sunday I discoursed upon the third chapter of the\n    Epistle of St. James; but there was only Alice in the Coombe\n    pew. I saw, however, that she more than once turned away her\n    face with shame, although I certainly did not discover any\n    tears. It is to be hoped that she gave Sir Roland an accurate\n    summary of my discourse; none of which (as I explained to your\n    dear aunt after the service) was intended for my own domestic\n    hearth. Since that time I have not had the pleasure of meeting\n    Sir Roland Lorraine in private life.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now a few words as to your own conduct. Your memory is\n    now so bad that you may have forgotten what I did for you.\n    At a time when my parish and family were in much need of my\n    attention, and two large coveys of quite young birds were\n    lying every night in the corner of the Hays, I left my home in\n    extremely hot weather, simply to be of use to you. My services\n    may have been trifling; but at that time you did not think so.\n    It was not my place to interfere in a matter which was for your\n    father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision. But I so far committed myself, that if you\n    are fool enough and knave enough--for I never mince language,\n    as your father does--to repudiate your engagement with a\n    charming and sensible girl, for the sake of high-flying but\n    low-minded Papists, much of the disgrace will fall on me.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what are those Spanish families (descended perhaps from\n    Don Quixote, or even Sancho Panza) to compare with Kentish\n    landowners, who derive their title from the good old Danes?\n    And what are their women when they get yellow--as they always\n    do before twenty-five--compared with an Englishwoman, who\n    generally looks her best at forty? And not only that (for after\n    all, that is a secondary question, as a man grows wise), but is\n    a southern foreigner likely to make an Englishman happy? Even\n    if she becomes converted from her image-worship (about which\n    they are very obstinate), can she keep his house for him? Can\n    she manage an English servant? Can she order a dinner? does she\n    even know when a bed is aired? can a gentleman dine and sleep\n    at her house after a day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hunting, without having rheumatism,\n    gout, and a bilious attack in the morning? All this, you will\n    think, can be managed by deputy; and in very large places it\n    must be so. But I have been a guest in very large places--very\n    much finer than Coombe Lorraine, however your father may have\n    scoffed at me; and I can only say that I would rather be the\n    guest of an English country-squire, or even a parson, with a\n    clever and active wife at the head of his table, than of a\n    duke with a grand French cook, and a duchess who never saw a\n    dust-pan.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if you should marry a Spaniard, where are you to get your\n    grand establishment? Your father never saves a farthing, and\n    you are even less likely to do so. And as for the lady, she\n    of course will have nothing. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My blood is blue because I have\n    no breeches,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says one of their poets, feelingly; and that is\n    the case with all of them. Whereas I have received a little\n    hint, it does not matter how or where, that Mabel Lovejoy (who\n    is much too good for any fickle jackanapes) is down for a\n    nice round sum in the will of a bachelor banker at Tonbridge.\n    Her father and mother do not know it, neither do any of her\n    family; but I did not pass my very pleasant holiday in that\n    town for nothing. Every one seemed to understand me, and I was\n    thoroughly pleased with all of them.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I shall not be pleased at all with you, and in good truth\n    you never shall darken my door, if you yield yourself, bound\n    hand and foot, to any of those Dulcineas, or rather Delilahs.\n    I have known a good many Spaniards, when Nelson was obliged to\n    take them prisoners; they are a dirty, lazy lot, unfit to ride\n    anything but mules, and they poison the air with garlic.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour aunt and cousins, who have read this letter, say that I\n    have been too hard upon you. The more they argue the more I am\n    convinced that I have been far too lenient. So that I will only\n    add their loves, and remain, my dear nephew,\n\n                       \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour affectionate uncle,\n\n                                                     \u00e2\u0080\u009cSTRUAN HALES.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cP.S.--We expect a very grand shooting season. Last year,\n    through the drought and heat, there was not a good turnip-field\n    in the parish. Birds were very numerous, as they always are in\n    hot seasons; but there was no getting near them. This season,\n    the turnips are up to my knees. How I wish that you were here,\n    instead of popping at the red legs! Through the great kindness\n    of young Steenie Chapman I am to have free warren of all Sir\n    Remnant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vast estates! But I like the home-shooting best; and\n    no doubt your father will come to a proper state of mind before\n    the first. Do not take amiss, my dear boy, whatever I may have\n    said for your good. _Scribe cito. Responde cras._\n\n                          \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour loving uncle,\n\n                                                            \u00e2\u0080\u009cS. H.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll this long epistle was read by Hilary in the saddle; for he had two\nhorses allowed him now--whenever he could get them--and now he was\ncantering with an order to an out-post of the advanced-guard, tracking\nthe rear of Clausel. They knew not yet what Clausel was,--one of the\nfew men who ever defied, and yet escaped from Wellington. The British\nStaff was weak just now, though freshly recruited with Hilary; or\nhaply the Frenchman might not have succeeded in his brilliant movement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe must be terribly put out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said young Lorraine, meaning neither\nClausel, nor Wellington, nor Napoleon even, but his Uncle Struan;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is not a word of any paragon dog, nor the horses he has bought\nor chopped, nor even little Cecil. He must have had a great row with\nmy father, and he visits it on this generation. How can he have heard\nof angelic Claudia, and then talk of garlic? My darling, I know what\nyou are, though heavy-seated Britons fail to soar to such perfection!\nNow for Alice, I suppose. She will know how to behave, I should hope.\nWhy how she begins, as if I were her thirty-second cousin ten times\nremoved! And how precious short it is! But what a beautifully clear\nfirm hand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMY DEAR HILARY,\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father, not having any time to spare just now, and having\n    received no letter from you which he might desire to answer,\n    has asked me to say that we are quite well, and that we are\n    very glad to hear that you seem to have greatly distinguished\n    yourself. To hear this must always be, as you will feel, a\n    pleasure and true pride to us. At the same time we have been\n    very anxious, because you have been returned in the _Gazette_\n    as heavily wounded. We hope, however, that it is not so, for we\n    have been favoured with a very long letter from Major Clumps of\n    your regiment to my grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dear friend, Lady de Lampnor,\n    in which you were spoken of most highly; and since that he has\n    not spoken of you, as he must have done, if you were wounded.\n    Pray let us hear at once what the truth is. Uncle Struan was\n    very rude to my father about you the other day, and used the\n    most violent language, and preached such a sermon against\n    himself on Sunday! But he has not been up to apologize yet; and\n    I hear from dear Cecil that he means to tell you all about it.\n    He is most thoroughly good, poor dear; but allowances must be\n    made for him.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe will tell you, of course, all the gossip of the place;\n    which is mainly, as usual, about himself. He seems to attach so\n    much importance to what we consider trifles. And he does the\n    most wonderful things sometimes.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has taken a boy from the bottom of our hill--the boy that\n    stole the donkey, and lived upon rags and bottles--and he has\n    him at the Rectory, every day except Sunday, to clean knives\n    and boots. The whole of the village is quite astonished; the\n    boy used to run for his life at the sight of dear Uncle Struan,\n    and we cannot help thinking that it is done just because we\n    could never encourage the boy.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa thinks that you are very likely to require a little cash\n    just now, for he knows that young officers are poorly paid,\n    even when they can get their money, which is said to be scarce\n    with your brave army now; therefore he has placed \u00c2\u00a3100 to\n    your credit with Messrs. Shotman, for which you can draw as\n    required, and the money will be replaced at Christmas. And\n    grandmamma begs me to add that she is so pleased with your\n    success in the only profession fit for a gentleman, that she\n    sends from her own purse twenty guineas, through the hands of\n    Messrs. Shotman. And she trusts that you will now begin to\n    cultivate frugality.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith these words I must now conclude, prolonging only to\n    convey the kind love of us all, and best desires for your\n    welfare, with which I now subscribe myself,\n\n                      \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour affectionate sister,\n\n                                                   \u00e2\u0080\u009cALICE LORRAINE.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cP.S.--Darling Brother,--The above has been chiefly from that\n    grandmamma. I have leave to write to you now myself; and the\n    rest of this piece of paper will hold not a hundredth part\n    of what I want to say. I am most unhappy about dear papa,\n    and about you, and Uncle Struan, and Captain Chapman, and\n    everybody. Nothing goes well; and if you fight in Spain, we\n    fight much worse in England. Father is always thinking, and\n    dwelling upon his thoughts, in the library. He knows that he\n    has been hard upon you; and the better you go on, the more he\n    worries himself about it, because he is so thoroughly set upon\n    being just to everyone. And even concerning a certain young\n    lady--it is not as Uncle Struan fancies. You know how headlong\n    he is, and he cannot at all understand our father. My father\n    has a justice such as my uncle cannot dream of. But dear papa\n    doubts your knowledge of your own mind, darling Hilary. What\n    a low idea of Uncle Struan, that you were sent to Spain to\n    be tempted! I did not like what happened to you in Kent last\n    summer, any more than other people did. But I think that papa\n    would despise you--and I am quite sure that I should--if you\n    deceived anybody after leading them to trust you. But of course\n    you could not do it, darling, any more than I could.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow do write home a nice cheerful letter, with every word of\n    all you do, and everything you can think of. Papa pretends\n    to be very quiet--but I am sure that is always thinking of\n    you; and he seems to grow so much older. I wish all his books\n    were at Hanover! I would take him for a good ride every day.\n    Good-bye, darling! If you make out this, you will deserve\n    a crown of crosses. Uncle Struan thought that he was very\n    learned; and he confounded the mural with the civic crown!\n    Having earned the one, earn the other by saving us all, and\n    your own\n\n                                                          \u00e2\u0080\u009cLALLIE.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary read this letter twice; and then put it by, to be read again;\nfor some of it touched him sadly. Then he delivered the orders he\nbore, and made a rough sketch of the valley, and returning by another\ntrack, drew forth his third epistle. This he had feared to confront,\nbecause his conscience went against him so; for he knew that the hand\nwas Gregory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. However, it must be met sooner or later; it was no good\nputting off the evil day; and so he read as follows:--\n\n                                     \u00e2\u0080\u009cMid. Temple, Aug. 22nd, 1812.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMY DEAR LORRAINE,\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is now many months since I heard from you, and knowing that\n    you had been wounded, I have been very anxious about you, and\n    wrote three several times to inquire, under date May 3rd, June\n    7th, and July 2nd. Of course none of these may have come to\n    hand, as they were addressed to your regiment, and I do not at\n    all understand how you manage without having any post-town. But\n    I have heard through my friend Capper, who knows two officers\n    of your regiment, that you were expected to return to duty in\n    July, since which I have vainly expected to hear from you by\n    every arrival. No one, therefore, can charge me with haste or\n    impatience in asking, at last, for some explanation of your\n    conduct. And this I do with a heavy heart, in consequence of\n    some reports which have reached me, from good authority.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cConfound the fellow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the conscious Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow he beats about\nthe bush! Will he never have it out and be done with it? What an\nabominably legal and cold-blooded style! Ah, now for it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must be aware that you have won the warmest regard, and\n    indeed I must say the whole heart, of my sister Mabel. This\n    was much against the wishes and intentions of her friends. She\n    was not thrown in your way to catch the heir to a title, and\n    a rich man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son. We knew that there would be many obstacles,\n    and we all desired to prevent it. Even I, though carried away\n    by my great regard for you, never approved it. If you have a\n    particle of your old candour left, you will confess that from\n    first to last the engagement was of your own seeking. I knew,\n    and my sister also knew, that your father could not be expected\n    to like it, or allow it, for a very long time to come. But we\n    also knew that he was a man of honour and integrity, and that\n    if he broke it off, it would be done by fair means, and not by\n    foul. Everything depended upon yourself. You were not a boy,\n    but a man at least five years older than my sister; and you\n    formed this attachment with your eyes open, and did your utmost\n    to make it mutual.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure I did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the young officer, giving a swish to his\ninnocent horse, because himself deserved it; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow could I help it?\nShe was such a dear! How I wish I had never seen Claudia! But really,\nGregory, come now, you are almost too hard upon me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd not only this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued that inexorable young barrister;\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut lest there should be any doubt about your serious\n    intentions, you induced, or at any rate you permitted, your\n    uncle, the Rev. Struan Hales, to visit Mabel and encourage\n    her, and assure her that all opposition would fail if she\n    remained true and steadfast.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMabel has remained true and steadfast, even to the extent of\n    disbelieving that you can be otherwise. From day to day, and\n    from week to week, she has been looking for a message from\n    you, if it were only one kind word. She has felt your wound,\n    I make bold to say, a great deal more than you have done. She\n    has taken more pride than you can have taken, in what she calls\n    your \u00e2\u0080\u0098glory.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 She watches every morning for the man who goes\n    for the letters, and every evening she waits and listens for a\n    step that never comes.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she could only make up her mind that you had quite\n    forgotten her, I hope that she would try to think that you were\n    not worth grieving for. But the worst of it is that she cannot\n    bring herself to think any ill of you. And until she has it\n    under your own hand that you are cruel and false to her, she\n    only smiles at and despises those who think it possible.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must put a stop to this state of things. It is not fair\n    that any girl should be kept in the dark and deluded so;\n    least of all such a girl as Mabel, so gentle, and true, and\n    tender-hearted. Therefore I must beg you at once to write to my\n    sister or to me, and to state honestly your intentions. If your\n    intention is to desert my sister, I ask you, as a last favour,\n    to do it as rudely and roughly as possible, so that her pride\n    may be aroused and help her to overget the blow. But if you can\n    give any honourable explanation of your conduct, no one will be\n    more delighted, and beg your pardon more heartily and humbly,\n    than your former friend,\n\n                                                 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGREGORY LOVEJOY.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nTRY TO THINK THE BEST OF ME.\n\n\nLorraine set spurs to his horse as soon as he got to the end of this\nletter. It was high time for him to gallop away from the one idea,--the\nbitter knowledge that out of this he could not come with the conscience\nof a gentleman. He was right in fleeing from himself, as hard as\never he could go; for no Lorraine had been known ever to behave so\nshabbily. In the former days of rather low morality and high feudalism,\nmany Lorraines might have taken fancies to pretty girls, and jilted\nthem--but never as he had done; never approaching a pure maid as an\nequal, and pledging honour to her, and then dishonourably deserting her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure I know not what to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, in a cold sweat, while\nhis nag was in a very hot one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven knows who my true love is. I am\nalmost sure that it must be Mabel; because when I think of her I get\nhot; and when I think of Claudia, I get cold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere may have been some sense in this; at any rate it is a question\nfor a meteorologist. Though people who explain--as they always\nmanage to do--everything, might without difficulty declare that they\nunderstood the whole of it. That a young man in magnetic attitude\ntowards two maidens widely distinct, one positive and one negative,\nshould hop up and down, like elder-pith, would of course be accounted\nfor by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrange phenomena of electricity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But little was known of\nsuch things then; and every man had to confront his own acts, without\nany fine phraseology. And Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acts had left him now in such a\nposition--or \u00e2\u0080\u009cfix\u00e2\u0080\u009d as it is forcibly termed nowadays--that even that\nmost inventive Arab, the Sheikh of the Subterfuges, could scarcely have\ndelivered him.\n\nBut, after all, the griefs of the body (where there is perpetual work)\nknock at the door of the constitution louder than those of the mind\ndo. And not only Hilary now, but all the British army found it hard to\nget anything to eat. As for money--there was none, or next to none,\namong them; but this was a trifling matter to men who knew so well how\nto help themselves. But shoes, and clothing, and meat for dinner, and\nyellow soap for horny soles, and a dram of something strong at night\nbefore lying down in the hole of their hips,--they felt the want of\nthese comforts now, after spending a fortnight in Madrid. And now they\nwere bound to march every day fifteen to twenty English miles, over\nvery hard ground, and in scorching weather, after an enemy offering\nmore than affording chance of fighting.\n\nThese things made every British bosom ready to explode with anger; and\nthe Staff was blamed, as usual, for negligence, ignorance, clumsiness,\ninability, and all the rest of it. These reproaches entered deeply into\nthe bruised heart of Lorraine, and made him so zealous that his chief\nvery often laughed while praising him. And thus in the valley of the\nArlanzan, on the march towards Burgos, he became a gallant captain,\nwith the goodwill of all who knew him.\n\nLorraine was royally proud of this; for his nature was not\nself-contained. He contemplated many letters beginning \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain\nLorraine presents his compliments to so-and-so;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he even thought at\none time of thus defying his Uncle Struan. However, a little reflection\nshowed him that the wisest plan was to let the Rector abide a while in\nsilence. It was out of all reason--though not, perhaps, entirely beyond\nprecedent--that he, the least injured of all the parties, should be the\nloudest in complaint; and it would serve him right to learn, from the\nhostile source of Coombe Lorraine, the withering fact that his recreant\nnephew was now a British captain bold.\n\nTo Alice, therefore, the Captain wrote at the very first opportunity,\nto set forth his promotion, and to thank his father and grandmother for\ncash. But he made no allusion to home-affairs, except to wish everybody\nwell. This letter he despatched on the 17th of September; and then,\nbeing thoroughly stiff and weary from a week spent in the saddle,\nhe shunned the camp-fires and the cooking, and slept in a tuffet of\nplantain-grass, to the melody of the Arlanzan.\n\nOn the following day our army, being entirely robbed of fighting by a\ndancing Frenchman (who kept snapping his fingers at Lord Wellington),\nentered in no pleasant humour into a burning city. The sun was hot\nenough in all conscience, roasting all wholesome Britons into a dirty\nMoorish colour, without a poor halt and maimed soldier having to march\nbetween burning houses. A house on fire is full of interest, and has\nbecome proverbial now as an illustration of bright success. But the\nmetaphor--whether derived or not from military privileges--proceeds on\nthe supposition that the proper people have applied the torch. In the\npresent case this was otherwise. The Frenchmen had fired the houses,\nand taken excellent care to rob them first.\n\nFinding the heat of the town of Burgos almost past endurance, although\nthe fire had now been quenched, Hilary strolled forth towards sunset\nfor a little change of air. His duties, which had been so incessant,\nwere cut short for a day or two; but to move his legs, with no horse\nbetween them, seemed at first unnatural. He passed through narrow\nreeking streets, where filthy people sprawled about under overlapping\neaves and coignes, and then he came to the scorched rough land, and\nlooked back at the citadel. The garrison, now that the smoke was\nclearing from the houses below the steep (which they had fired for\nsafety\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake), might be seen in the western light, training their guns\nupon the city, which swarmed with Spanish guerillas.\n\nThese sons of the soil were plundering with as good a grace as if\nthemselves had taken a hostile city; and in the enthusiasm of the\nmoment, or from force of habit perhaps, some of them gladly lent a hand\nin robbing their own houses. But the British soldiers grounded arms,\nand looked on very grimly; for they had not carried the town by storm,\nand their sense of honesty prevailed. All this amused Lorraine, who\nwatched it through his field-glass, as he sat on a rocky mound outside\nthe city, resting himself, for his legs were stiff, and feeling quite\nout of his element at being his own master. But presently he saw that\nthe French, who were very busy in the castle, were about to treat both\nSpaniards and Britons to a warm salute of shells; and he rose at once\nto give them warning, but found his legs too stiff for speed. So he\nthrew a half-dollar to a Portuguese soldier, who was sauntering on the\nroad below, and bade him run at his very best pace, and give notice of\ntheir danger.\n\nBut before his messenger had passed the gate, Hilary saw a Spanish\nchief, as in the distance he seemed to be, come swiftly out of a\nside street, and by rapid signals recall and place quite out of the\nline of fire all the plundering Spaniards. This man, as Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nspy-glass showed him, was of very great breadth and stature, and wore\na slouch-hat with a short black feather, a green leather jerkin, and\na broad white sash; his mighty legs were encased above mid-thigh in\nboots of undressed hide; and he was armed with a long straight sword\nand dagger. Having some experience of plunderers, Hilary was surprised\nat the prompt obedience yielded to this guerilla chief, until he was\ngratified by observing a sample of his discipline. For two of his men\ndemurring a little to the abandonment of their prey, he knocked them\ndown as scientifically as an English pugilist, handed their booty\nto others, and had them dragged by the heels round the corner. Then\nhaving his men all under cover, he stood in a calm and reflective\nattitude, with an immense cigar in his mouth, to see a fine group of\nthirsty Britons (who were drinking in the middle of the square), shot\nor shelled as the case might be. And when Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s messenger ran up in\nbreathless haste to give the alarm, and earn his half-dollar honestly,\nwhat did that ruthless fellow do, but thrust forth a long leg, trip\nhim up, and hand him over with a grin to some brigands, who rifled his\npockets and stopped his mouth. Then came what Hilary had expected, a\nroar, a plunge, a wreath of smoke, and nine or ten brave Englishmen lay\nshattered round the fountain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat Spaniard is a very queer ally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, with a shudder.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe knew what was coming, and he took good care that it should not be\nprevented. Let me try to see his face, if my good glass will show it.\nI call him a bandit, and nothing else. _Partidas_ indeed! I call them\ncut-throats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt that very moment, the great guerilla turned round to indulge in a\nhearty laugh, and having a panel of pitched wall behind him, presented\nhis face (like a portrait in an ebony frame) towards Hilary. The collar\nof the jerkin was rolled back, and the great bull throat and neck left\nbare, except where a short black beard stood forth, like a spur of jet\nto the heavy jaws. The mouth was covered with a thick moustache; but\nhaughty nostrils and a Roman nose, as well as deep lines of face, and\nfierce eyes hung with sullen eyebrows, made Hilary cry, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat an ugly\nfellow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he turned his glass upon something else.\n\nYet this was a face such as many women dote upon and almost adore.\nPower is the first thing they look for in the face of a man; or at\nleast it is the very first thing that strikes them. And \u00e2\u0080\u009cpower\u00e2\u0080\u009d of\nthat sort is headstrong will, with no regard for others. From mental\npower it so diverges that very few men have embodied both; as nature\nhas kindly provided, for the happiness of the rest of us. But Captain\nLorraine, while he watched that Spaniard, knew that he must be a man\nof mark, though he little dreamed that his wild love Claudia utterly\nscorned his own comely self in comparison with that \u00e2\u0080\u009cugly fellow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut for the moment the sight of that brigand, and slaughter of good\nEnglish soldiers, set Hilary (who, with all his faults, was vigorously\npatriotic) against the whole race of Spaniards, male or female, or\nwhatever they might be.\n\nMoreover, his long absence now from Claudia, and her neglect to write\n(as she had promised to do) to him, as well as an anecdote which he had\nheard on good authority about her, had combined to weaken the spell of\nher dazzling and impassioned beauty--a power which above all others,\nmust have its victim within reach. And even as regarded mere personal\ncharms, the more he had to deal with the Spanish race, the more he\nacknowledged the truth of the words of his good Uncle Struan. Mabel, at\nthirty, would be in full beauty; Claudia would be rapidly falling into\nthe sere and yellow leaf. The more he thought of the matter, the more\nhis heart glowed back towards the one who loved him, and cooled towards\nthe selfish foreigner.\n\nWhile he was in this state of mind, a mounted orderly dashed up, and\nplaced a small parcel in his hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom home, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, and\nsaluted, and dashed off. Hilary opened it, and found a most lovely\nminiature of Mabel. There was the good, bright, clever face; the calm\nclear forehead, and the rich brown eyes; the rosy lips ready for a\ncharming smile; the soft glossy hair, in natural curls to fit caressing\nfingers. Above all there was, what there never could be in the face of\nClaudia, the happy expression of loving-kindness, faith, and truth, and\nconstancy.\n\nWho sent that portrait was for years unknown to any one but the sender.\nIt proved in the end to be Uncle Struan.\n\nHilary gazed at it most intently, and for some moments sadly. But the\nmore he gazed the better and brighter became his own expression. The\ngoodness of his true-love seemed to breathe from her face into his, and\nfill him with a likeness to her, and chasten, enlarge, and ennoble him.\n\nHesitation was thenceforth banished; and being driven by nature,\nas usual, rather with a spur than bridle, he made a strong dash at\na desperate fence which for months had been puzzling him. Horses\nunluckily do not write, although they talk, and laugh, and think, and\ntell with their eyes a great deal more than most of us who ride them.\nTherefore this metaphor must be dropped, for Lorraine pulled out his\nroll of paper, pen, and ink (which he was bound to carry), and put up\nhis knees, all stiff and creaking, and on that desk did what he ought\nto have done at least three months ago. He wrote to his loving Mabel;\nsurely better late than never.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMY DARLING MABEL,\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that I have not behaved to you kindly, or even as a\n    gentleman. Although I was not allowed to write to you, I ought\n    to have written to your brother Gregory long ago, and I am\n    ashamed of myself. But I am much more ashamed of the reason,\n    and I will make no sham excuses. It is difficult to say what I\n    want to say; but my only amends is to tell the whole truth, and\n    I hope that you will try to allow for me.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the truth is this. I fell in love: not as I did with\n    you, my darling, just because I loved you; but because--well,\n    I cannot tell why, although I am trying for the very truth;\n    I cannot tell why I did it. She saved my life, and nursed me\n    long. She was not bad-looking; but young and brave.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope that it is all over now. I trust in the Lord that it\n    is so. I see that these Spaniards are cruel people, and I work\n    night and day to forget them all. When I get any sleep, it is\n    you that come and look upon me beautifully; and when I kick up\n    with those plaguesome insects, the face that I see is a Spanish\n    one. This alone shows where my heart is fixed. But you have\n    none of those things at Old Applewood.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now I can say no more. I write in the midst of roaring\n    cannon, and perhaps you will say, when you see my words, that I\n    had better have died of my wounds, than live to disgrace, as I\n    have done, your\n\n                                                           \u00e2\u0080\u009cHILARY.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cP.S.--Try to think the best of me, darling. If anybody needs\n    it, I do. Gregory wrote me such a letter that I am afraid to\n    send you any--anythings!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nSOMETHING WORTH KISSING.\n\n\nPessimists who love to dwell on the darker side of human nature,\nand find (or at any rate colour) that perpetually changing object\nto the tone of their own dull thoughts, making our whole world no\nbetter than the chameleon of themselves; who trace every act and word\nand thought, either to very mean selfishness, or exceedingly grand\ndestiny--according to their own pet theory,--let those gloomy spirits\nmigrate in as cheerful a manner as they can manage to the back side\nof the moon, the side that neither shines on earth, nor gathers any\nearthshine. But even if they will not thus oblige inferior mortals, let\nthem not come near a scene where true love dwells, and simple faith,\nand pleasant hours are spent in helping nature to be kind to us.\n\nWhere the rich recesses of the bosomed earth brim over with variety;\nwhere every step of man discloses some new goodness over him; and\nevery hour of the day shows different veins of happiness; the light in\nsloping glances looking richer as the sun goes down, and showing with a\ndeeper love its own good works and parentage; the children of the light\npresenting all their varied joy to it; some revolving, many bending,\nall with one accord inclining softly, sweetly, and thankfully,--can any\nman, even of a churlish nature, wander about at a time like this, with\nthe power of the sunset over him, and walk down the alleys of trees,\nand spend a leisure hour among them, without admitting into his heart a\ncalm unconscious kindliness?\n\nIf any man could be so ungrateful to the Giver of all good things,\nhe was not to be found in the land of Kent, but must be sought in\nsome northern county where they grow sour gooseberries. Master Martin\nLovejoy had, in the month of October, 1812, as fine a crop of pears as\never made a fountain of a tree.\n\nFor the growers did not understand the pruning of trees as we do now.\nThey were a benighted lot altogether, proceeding only by rule of thumb\nand the practice of their grandfathers, never lopping the roots of a\ntree, nor summer pinching, nor wiring it, nor dislocating its joints;\nand yet they grew as good fruit as we do! They had no right to do so;\nbut the thing is beyond denial. Therefore one might see a pear-tree\nrising in its natural form, tall and straight and goodly, hanging\nits taper branches like a chandelier with lustrous weight, tier upon\ntier, the rich fruit glistening with the ruddy sun-streaks, or with\nrusset veinage mellowing. Hard thereby the Golden Noble, globular and\nstainless, or the conical King Pippin, pencilled on its orange fulness\nwith a crimson glow, or the great bulk of Dutch Codlin, oblong, ribbed,\nand over-bearing. Here was the place and time for a man to sit in the\nmidst of his garden, and feel that the year was not gone in vain, nor\nhis date of life lessened fruitlessly, and looking round with right\ngood will, thank the Lord, and remember his father.\n\nIn such goodly mood and tenor Master Martin Lovejoy sat, early of an\nOctober afternoon, to smoke his pipe and enjoy himself. He had finished\nhis dinner--a plain but good one; his teeth were sound, and digestion\nstanch; he paid his tithes and went to church; he had not an enemy in\nthe world, to the utmost of his knowledge; and his name was good for a\nthousand pounds from Canterbury to Reigate. His wheat had been fine,\nand his hops pretty good, his barley by no means below the mark, the\ncherry and strawberry season fair, and his apples and pears as you\nsee them. Such a man would be guilty of a great mistake if he kept on\nthe tramp perpetually. Fortune encouraged him to sit down, and set an\narm-chair and a cushion for him, and mixed him a glass of Schiedam and\nwater, with a slice of lemon, and gave him a wife to ask how his feet\nwere, as well as a daughter to see to his slippers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get on at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as he mixed Mrs Lovejoy the\nleast little drop, because of the wind going round to the north; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nare so abstemious, my dear soul; by-and-by you will pay out for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must be a disciplinarian, Martin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Lovejoy replied, with a sad\nsweet smile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow ever the ladies can manage to take beer, wine, gin,\nbitters, and brandy, in the way they do, all of an afternoon, is beyond\nmy comprehension.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey get used to it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Grower, calmly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand their\nconstitution requires it. At the same time I am not saying, mind you,\nthat some of them may not overdo it. Moderation is the golden rule; but\nyou carry it too far, my dear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter too little than too much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Lovejoy sententiously.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever I take, I like just to know that there is something in it,\nand no more. No, Martin, no--if you please, not more than the thickness\nof my thumb-nail. Well, now for what we were talking about. We can\nnever go on like this, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWife, I will tell you what it is\u00e2\u0080\u009d--here Martin Lovejoy tried to look\nboth melancholy and stern, but failed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe do not use our duties right;\nwe do not work up in the position to which it has pleased God to call\nus. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make our children see that they are--bless my heart, what\nis the word?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Obligated\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is the word you mean. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Obligated\u00e2\u0080\u0099 they all of them are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no; \u00e2\u0080\u0098bounden\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is the word I mean; \u00e2\u0080\u0098bounden\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says the Catechism.\nThey are bounden to obey, whether they like it or no, and that is the\nword\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expression. Now is there one of them as does it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say there is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his wife replied, after thinking of all three\nof them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMartin, no; they do their best, but you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have them quite\ntied hand and foot. And I doubt whether we should love them better, if\nwe had them always to order.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLikely not. I cannot tell. They have given me no chance of trying.\nThey do what seems best in their own eyes, and the fault of it lies\nwith you, mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo they ever do anything wrong, Martin Lovejoy? Do they ever disgrace\nyou anywhere? Do they ever go about and borrow money, or trade on their\nname, or anything? Surely you want to provoke me, Martin, when you\nbegin to revile my children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Grower, blowing smoke, in the manner of a matrimonial\nman, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us go to something else. Here is this affair of Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now.\nHow do you mean to settle it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you should rather tell me, Martin, how you mean to settle\nit. She might have been settled long ago, in a good position and\ncomfortable, if my advice had been heeded. But you are the most\nobstinate man in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, my dear, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that you should be hard upon any\none in that respect. You have set your heart upon one thing, and I upon\nanother; and we have to deal with some one perhaps more obstinate than\nboth of us. She takes after her good mother there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter her father, more likely, Martin. But she has given her promise,\nand she will keep it, and the time is very nearly up, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe battle of Trafalgar, yes. The 21st of October, seven years ago, as\nI am a man! Lord bless me, it seems but yesterday! How all the country\nup and wept, and how it sent our boy to sea! There never can be such a\nthing again; and no one would look at a drumhead savoy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlague upon the market, Martin! I do believe you think much more\nof your growings than your gainings. But she fixed the day herself,\nbecause it was a battle; didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, wife, yes. But after all, I see not so much to come of it.\nSupposing she gets no letter by to-morrow-night, what comes of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, a very great deal. You men never know. She puts all her foolish\nideas aside, and she does her best to be sensible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the spread of my measure, oh deary me! I thought she was bound to\nmuch more than that. She gives up him, at any rate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, poor dear, she gives him up, and a precious cry she will make\nof it. Why, Martin, when you and I were young we carried on so\ndifferently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat use to talk about that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Grower: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey all must have\ntheir romances now. Like tapping a cask of beer, it is. You must let\nthem spit out at the top a little.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll that, of course, needs no discussion. I do not remember that, in\nour love-time, you expected to see me \u00e2\u0080\u0098spit out at the top!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 You grow\nso coarse in your ideas, Martin; the more you go growing, the coarser\nyou get.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, is there nothing to be said but that? She gives him up, and she\ntries to be sensible. The malting season is on, and how can Elias come\nand do anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMartin, may I say one word? You keep so perpetually talking, that I\nscarcely have a chance to breathe. We do not want that low Jenkins\nhere. How many quarters he soaks in a week is nothing, and cannot be\nanything to me. A tanner is more to my taste a great deal, if one must\ncome down to the dressers. And there one might get some good ox-tails.\nI believe that you want to sell your daughter to get your malt for\nnothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Grower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indignation at this despicable charge was such, that he\nrolled in his chair, like a man in a boat, and spread his sturdy legs,\nand said nothing, for fear of further mischief. Then he turned out his\nelbows, in a manner of his own, and Mrs. Lovejoy saw that she had gone\ntoo far.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she resumed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps not quite that. Mr. Jenkins, no\ndoubt, is very well in his way: and he shall have fair play, so far as\nI am concerned. But mind, Dr. Calvert must have the same; that was our\nbargain, Martin. All the days of the week to be open to both, and no\ndifference in the dinner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, very well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the franklin murmured, being still a little\nwounded about the malt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure I put up with anything. Calvert\nmay have her, if he can cure her. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear to see the poor maid\nso pining. It makes my heart ache many a time; but I have more faith\nin barley-corn than jalap; though I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want neither of them for\nnothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall see, my dear, how she will come round. The doctor prescribes\ncarriage exercise for her. Well, how is she to get it, except in his\ncarriage? And she cannot well have his carriage, I suppose, before she\nmarries him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCarriage exercise? Riding on wheels, I suppose, is what they mean by\nit. If riding on wheels will do her any good, she can have our yellow\ngig five times a-week. And I want to go round the neighbourhood too.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some little bits of money owing me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take her for a drive\nto-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour yellow gig! To call that a carriage! A rough sort of exercise, I\ndoubt. Why, it jerks up, like a Jack-in-a-box, at every stone you come\nto. If that is your idea of a carriage, Martin, pray take us all out in\nthe dung-cart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe old gig was good enough for my mother; and why should my daughter\nbe above it? They doctors and women are turning her head, worse than\npoor young Lorraine did. Oh, if I had Elias to prune my trees--after\nall I have taught him--and Lorraine to get up in the van again; I might\nkeep out of the bankrupt court after all; I do believe I might.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here\nthe Grower fetched a long sigh through his pipe. He was going to be\nbankrupt every season; but never achieved that glory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Lovejoy said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou used to frighten me with\nit at first, whenever there came any sort of weather--a storm, or a\nfrost, or too much sun, or too much rain, or too little of it; the Lord\nknows that if you have had any fruit, you have got it out of Him by\ngrumbling. And now you are longing, in a heathenish manner, to marry\nyour daughter to two men at once! One for the night-work, and one for\nthe day. Now, will you, for once, speak your mind out truly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, wife, there is no one that tries a man so badly as his own wife\ndoes. I am pretty well known for speaking my mind too plainly, more\nthan too doubtfully. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say the same to you, as I should have to\nsay to anybody else; because you are my wife, you see, and have a good\nright to be down upon me. And so I am forced to get away from things\nthat ought to be argued. But about my daughter, I have a right to think\nmy own opinion; while I leave your own to you, as a father has a right\nwith a mother. And all I say is common-sense. Our Mabel belongs to a\ntime of life when the girls are always dreaming. And then you may say\nwhat you like to them mainly; and it makes no difference. Now she looks\nvery pale, and she feels very queer, all through that young sort of\nmischief. But let her get a letter from Master Hilary--and you would\nsee what would come over her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have got it! I have got it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried a young voice, as if in answer,\nalthough too sudden of approach for that. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFather, here it is! Mother,\nhere it is! Long expected, come at last! There, what do you think of\nthat now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer face was lit with a smile of delight, and her eyes with tears of\ngladness, as she stood between her astonished parents, and waved in the\nair an open letter, fluttering less (though a breeze was blowing) than\nher true heart fluttered. Then she pressed the paper to her lips, and\nkissed it, with a good smack every time; and then she laid it against\nher bosom, and bowed to her father and mother, as much as to say--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nmay think what you like of me--I am not ashamed of it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Grower pushed two grey curls aside, and looked up with a grand\namazement. Here was a girl, who at dinner-time even would scarcely say\nmore than \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cno;\u00e2\u0080\u009d who started when suddenly spoken to, and\nwas obliged to clear her mind to think; who smiled now and then, when\na smile was expected, and not because she had a smile,--in a word,\nwho had become a dull, careless, unnatural, cloudy, depressed, and\nabominably inconsistent Mabel--a cause of anxiety to her father, and of\nrecklessness to herself--when lo, at a touch of the magic wand, here\nshe was, as brave as ever!\n\nThe father, and the mother also, knew the old expression settled on the\ndarling face again; the many family modes of thinking, and of looking,\nand of loving, and of feeling out for love, which only a father and a\nmother dearly know in a dear child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. And then they looked at one\nanother; and in spite of all small variance, the husband and the wife\nwere one in the matter of rejoicing.\n\nIt was not according to their schemes, and they both might still be\nobstinate. But by a stroke their hearts were opened--wise or foolish,\nright or wrong,--what they might say outside reason, they really could\nnot stop to think. They only saw that their sweet good child, for many\nlong months a stranger to them, was come home to their hearts again.\nAnd they could have no clearer proof than this.\n\nShe took up her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pipe, and sniffed with a lofty contempt at the\nsealing-wax (which was of the very lowest order), and then she snapped\nit off and scraped him (with a tortoiseshell handled knife of her own)\na proper place to suck at. And while she was doing that, and most busy\nwith one of her fingers to make a draught, she turned to her mother\nwith her other side, as only a very quick girl could do, and tucked up\nsome hair (which was slipping from the string, with a palpable breach\nof the unities) and gave her two tugs, in the very right place to make\nher of the latest fashion; and then let her know, with lips alone, what\nstore she set on her opinion. And the whole of this business was done\nin less time than two lovers would take for their kissing!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have beaten me, Popsy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Lovejoy, fetching up an old name\nof the days when she was nursing this one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDash me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Grower; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall marry Old Harry, if you choose\nto set your heart on him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nA DANGEROUS COMMISSION.\n\n\nPeradventure the eyes and the heart, as well as the boundless charity\nof true love, were needed to descry what Mabel at a glance discovered,\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrand nobility\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct, and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpathetic beauty\u00e2\u0080\u009d of\nhis self-reproach. Perhaps at first sight the justice of the latter\nwould be a more apparent thing; but love (when it deserves the name) is\na generous as well as a jealous power; especially in the tender gush of\nrenewal and reunion. And Lorraine meant every word as he wrote it, and\nindeed for a good while afterwards; so that heart took pen to heart,\nwhich is sometimes better than the wings of speech. Giving comfort\nthus, he also received the same from his own conscience and pure\nresolutions; and he felt that his good angel was, for the present at\nleast, come back to him. How long she would stop was another question.\n\nAnd he needed her now in matters even more stirring than the hottest\nlove-affairs. For though he had no chance of coming to the front in\nany of the desperate assaults on the castle of Burgos, being far away\nthen with despatches, he was back with his chief when the retreat\nbegan; a retreat which must have become a rout under any but the finest\nmanagement. For the British army was at its worst towards the month of\nNovember, 1812. Partly from intercourse with _partidas_, partly perhaps\nfrom the joys of Madrid, but mainly no doubt from want of cash, the\nBritons were not as they had been. Even the officers dared to be most\nthoroughly disobedient, and to follow the route which they thought\nbest, instead of that laid down for them. But Wellington put up with\ninsolent ignorance, as a weaker man could not have deigned to do: he\nhad to endure it from those above him; and he knew how to bear it with\nall around him; and yet to be the master. His manifold dealings with\neverybody and everything at this time (with nobody caring to understand\nhim, and his own people set against him; with the whole world making\nlittle of him, because he hated flash-work; and perhaps his own mind\nin some doubt of its powers, because they were not recognised)--these,\nand the wearisome uphill struggle to be honest without any money, were\nbeginning to streak with grey the hair that had all the hard brain\nunder it.\n\nHere again was a chance for Hilary; and without thinking, he worked it\nwell. In his quick, and perhaps too sudden, way of taking impression of\nevery one, he had stamped on his mind the abiding image of his great\ncommander. The General knew this (as all men feel the impression they\nare making, as sharply almost as a butter-stamp), and of course he felt\ngoodwill towards the youth who so looked up to him. It was quite a new\nthing for this great Captain, after all his years of conquest, to be\naccounted of any value; because he was not a Frenchman.\n\nBeing, however, of rigid justice, although he was no Frenchman,\nLord Wellington did not lift Captain Lorraine over the heads of his\ncompeers. He only marked him (in his own clear and most tenacious mind)\nas one who might be trusted for a dashing job, and deserved to have the\nchance of it.\n\nAnd so they went into winter quarters on the Douro and Aguada, after\na great deal of fighting, far in the rear of their storms and sieges\nand their many victories; because the British Government paid whole\nmillions right and left to rogues, and left its own army to live\nwithout money, and to be hanged if it stole an onion. And the only\nsatisfaction our men had--and even in that they were generous--was to\nhear of the Frenchmen in Russia freezing, as fast as could well be\nexpected.\n\nNow, while this return to the frontier, and ebb of success created\ndisgust in England and depression among our soldiers, they also bore\nmost disastrously on the fortunes of a certain gallant and very zealous\nStaff officer. For they brought him again into those soft meshes,\nwhence he had wellnigh made good his escape without any serious damage;\nbut now there was no such deliverance for him. And this was a very hard\ncase, and he really did deserve some pity now; for he did not return\nof his own accord, and fall at the feet of the charmer; but in the\nstrictest course of duty became an unwilling victim. And it happened\naltogether in this wise.\n\nIn the month of May, 1813, when the British commander had all things\nready for that glorious campaign which drove the French over the\nPyrenees; and when the British army, freshened, strengthened, and\nsternly redisciplined, was eager to bound forward--a sudden and sad\ncheck arose. By no means, however, a new form of hindrance, but one\nonly too familiar at all times and in all countries--the sinews of\nwar were not forthcoming. The military chest was empty. The pay of\nthe British troops was far in arrear, and so was their bounty-money;\nbut that they were pretty well used to by this time, and grumble as\nthey might, they were ready to march. Not so, however, the Portuguese,\nwho were now an important element; and even the Spanish regulars in\nAndalusia would do nothing, until they had handled dollars.\n\nThis need of money had been well foreseen by the ubiquitous mind of\nWellington; but what he had not allowed for, and what no one else\nwould have taken into thought, so soon after Nelson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, was the\nsluggishness of the British navy. Whether it were the fault of our\nGovernment, or of our Admiral on the station, certain it is that the\nmouth of the Tagus (which was the mouth of the whole British army)\nwas stopped for days, and even weeks together, by a few American\nprivateers. And ships containing supplies for our army (whether of\nfood, or clothing, or the even more needful British gold), if they\nescaped at all, could do it only by running for the dangerous bar of\nthe Douro, or for Cadiz.\n\nIn this state of matters, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeneralissimo\u00e2\u0080\u009d sent for Captain Lorraine\none day, and despatched him on special duty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know Count Zamora,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lord Wellington, in his clear voice of\nprecision; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand his castle in the Sierra Morena.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary bowed, without a word, knowing well what his Chief was pleased\nwith.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou also know the country well, and the passes of the Morena. Colonel\nLangham has orders to furnish you with the five best horses at hand,\nand the two most trusty men he knows of. You will go direct to Count\nZamora\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, and deliver to him this letter. He will tell you what\nnext to do. I believe that the ship containing the specie, which will\nbe under your charge, was unable to make either Lisbon or the port of\nCadiz, and ran through the Straits for Malaga. But the Count will know\nbetter than I do. Remember that you are placed at his disposal, in\nall except one point--and that is the money. He will provide you with\nSpanish escort, and the Spaniards are liable for the money, through\nAndalusia, and the mountains, until you cross the Zujar, where a\ndetachment from General Hill will meet you. They begged me not to send\nBritish convoy (beyond what might be needful to authorize the delivery\nto them), because their own troops are in occupation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind that; be as wide awake as if every farthing was your own,\nor rather was part of your honour. I seldom place so young a man in a\nposition of so much trust. But the case is peculiar; and I trust you.\nThere will be \u00c2\u00a3100,000, in English gold, to take care of. The Spaniards\nwill furnish the transport, and Count Zamora will receive half of the\nspecie, on behalf of the Junta of Seville, for the pay of the Spanish\nforces, and give you his receipt for it. The remainder you will place\nunder the care of General Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s detachment, and rejoin us as soon\nas possible. I have no time more. Colonel Langham will give you your\npasses, and smaller directions. But remember that you are in a place\nof trust unusual for so young an officer. Good-bye, and keep a sharp\nlook-out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLord Wellington gave his hand, with a bow of the fine old type, to\nHilary. And he from his proper salute recovered, and took it as one\ngentleman takes the courtesy of another. But as he felt that firm,\nand cool, and muscular hand for a moment, he knew that he was treated\nwith extraordinary confidence; and that his future as an officer, and\nperhaps as a gentleman, hung on the manner in which he should acquit\nhimself of so rare a trust. In the courtyard he found Colonel Langham,\nwho gave him some written instructions, and his passes and credentials,\nas well as a good deal of sound advice, which the General had no time\nto give. And in another hour Hilary Lorraine was riding away in the\nhighest spirits, thinking of Mabel, and of all his luck; and little\ndreaming that he was galloping into the ditch of his fortunes.\n\nBehind him rode two well-tried troopers, as thoroughly trained to their\nwork as the best hereditary butler, gamekeeper or even pointer. There\ncould be found no steadier men in all the world of steadiness. One\nwas Sergeant-major Bones, and the other was Corporal Nickles. Each of\nthem led a spare horse by the soft brown twist of willow-bark, steeped\nin tan and fish-oil, so as to make a horse think much of it. And thus\nthey rode through the brilliant night, upon a fine old Roman road, with\nbeautiful change, and lovely air, and nobody to challenge them. For the\nFrench army lay to the east and north; the Portuguese were far in their\nrear; and the Spanish forces away to the south, except a few guerillas,\nwho could take nothing by meddling with them. But the next day was hot,\nand the road grew rough, and their horses fell weary; and, haste as\nthey might, they did not arrive at Monte Argento till after sunset of\nthe second day.\n\nThe Count of Zamora felt some affection, as well as much gratitude,\ntowards Lorraine, and showed it through the lofty courtesy with which\nhe received him. And Hilary, on his part, could not help admiring the\nvalour and patriotism, and almost poetic dignity, of this chieftain\nof a time gone by. For being of a simple mind, and highly valuing\neloquence, the Count nearly always began with a flourish as to what\nhe might have done for the liberation of his country; if he had been\nyounger. Having exhausted this reflection, he was wont to proceed at\nleisure to the military virtues of his sons. Then, if anybody showed\nimpatience, he always stopped with a lofty bow; otherwise, on he went,\nand the further he went, the more he enjoyed himself. Hilary, a very\npolite young man, and really a kind-hearted one, had grown into the\nCount\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good graces--setting aside all gratitude--by truly believing\nall his exploits, and those of his fathers and grandfathers, and best\nof all those of his two sons,--and never so much as yawning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are at my orders?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Count, with a dry smile on his fine\nold face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is well, my son; it is glorious. Our great commander has\nso commanded. My first order is that you come to the supper; and rest,\nand wear slippers, for the three days to follow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShall I take those instructions in writing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand under\nthe seal of the Junta?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Junta is an old woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his host; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe chatters, and she\nscolds, and she locks up the money. But enter, my son, enter, I pray\nyou. You are at the very right moment arrived--as is your habit; or I\nshould not be here. We have a young boar of the first nobility; and\ntruffles are in him from the banks which you know. You shall carve\nhim for us; you are so strong, and you Englishmen so understand sharp\nsteel. My sons are still at the war; but my daughters--how will they be\npleased to see you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the smell of the innocent young roaster--for such he was in\nverity,--light curtains rose, and light figures entered; for all\nSpanish ladies know well what is good. Camilla and Claudia greeted\nHilary, as if they had been with him all the morning; and turned their\nwhole minds to the table at once. And Hilary, thoroughly knowing their\nmanners, only said to himself, how well they looked!\n\nIn this he was right. The delicate grace and soft charm of Camilla set\noff the more brilliant and defiant beauty of young Claudia. Neither\nof them seemed to care in the least what anybody thought of her; or\nwhether any thought at all occurred to anybody, upon a subject so\nindifferent, distant, and purely abstract. Captain Lorraine was no\nmore to them than a friar, or pilgrim, or hermit. They were very much\nobliged to him for cutting up the pig; and they showed that they\nthought it a good pig.\n\nNow, as it happened, these were not the tactics fitted for the\nmoment. In an ordinary mood, Lorraine might have fallen to these fair\nParthians; but knowing what danger he was running into--without any\nchance of avoiding it--he had made up his mind, all along the road, to\nbe severely critical. Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true affection (as shown by a letter in\nanswer to his) had moved him; she had not hinted at any rival, or lapse\nof love on his part; but had told with all her dear warm heart the\npleasure, the pride, and the love she felt. Hilary had this letter in\nhis pocket; and it made him inclined to be critical.\n\nNow it may, without any lese-majesty of the grand female race, be\nasserted, that good, and kind, and beautiful, and purely superior as\nthey are, they are therewith so magnanimous to men, that they abstain,\nfor the most part, from exhibiting too much cruel perfection. No\nspecimen of them seems ever to occur that is entirely blameless, if\nsubmitted to rigid criticism; which, of course, they would never submit\nto. Therefore it was wrong of Hilary, and showed him in a despicable\nlight, that because the young ladies would not look at him much, he\nlooked at them with judicial eyes. And the result of his observation,\nover the backbone of the pig, was this.\n\nIn \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysique\u00e2\u0080\u009d--a word which ought to be worse than physic to an\nEnglishman--there was no fault of any sort to be found with either\nof these young ladies. They were noble examples of the best Spanish\ntype, tall, and pure, yet rich of tint, with most bewitching eyes, and\nclassic flexure of luxuriant hair, grace in every turn and gesture, and\nmelody in every tone. Yet even in the most expressive glance, and most\nenchanting smile, was there any of that simple goodness, loyalty, and\ncomfort, which were to be found in an equally lovely, but less superb\nyoung woman?\n\nHerewith the young Captain began to think of his Uncle Struan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice,\nand even his sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words on the matter; which from so haughty a\ngirl--as he called her, although he knew that she was not that--had\ncaused him at first no small surprise, and at the same time produced\nno small effect. And the end of it was that he gave a little squeeze\nto Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portrait and loving letter; and said to himself that one\nEnglish girl was worth a dozen Spanish ones.\n\nOn the following day, the fair young Donnas changed their mode of\naction. They vied with each other in attention to Hilary, led him\nthrough the well-known places, chattered Spanish most musically, and\nsang melting love-songs, lavished smiles and glances on him; and\nnothing was too good for him. He was greatly delighted, of course, and\nwas bound in gratitude to flirt a little; but still, on the whole,\nhe behaved very well. For instance, he gave no invidious preference\nto either of his lovely charmers; but paid as much heed to poor\nCamilla (whose heart was bounding with love and happiness) as he did\nto Claudia; who began to be in earnest now, that her sister might\nnot conquer him. This was a dangerous turn of events for Hilary; and\nit was lucky for him that he was promptly called away. For his host\ngot despatches which compelled him to cut short hospitality; and\nCaptain Lorraine, with great relief, set forth the next morning for\nMalaga. Sergeant Bones and Corporal Nickles had carried on handsomely\ndownstairs, and were most loth to come away; but duty is always the\nguiding-star of the noble British Corporal. Nickles and Bones, at the\ncall of their country, cast off all domestic ties, and buckled up their\nbelly-bands. Merrily thus they all rode on, for their horses were fresh\nand frolicsome, to the Spanish head-quarters near Cordova; and forward\nthence to Malaga.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nSTERLING AND STRIKING AFFECTION.\n\n\nAt this particular time there was nothing so thoroughly appreciated,\nloved, admired, and begged, borrowed, or stolen in every corner of the\nContinent, as the good old English guinea. His fine old face and his\njovial colour made him welcome everywhere; one look at him was enough\nto show his purity, substance, and sterling virtue, and prove him sure\nto outlast in the end the flashy and upstart \u00e2\u0080\u009cNapoleon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Happily for\nthe world, that poor, weak-coloured, and adulterated coin now called\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009csovereign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was not the representative of English worth at that\ntime; otherwise Europe might have been either France or Russia for a\ncentury.\n\nAnd though we are now in the mire so low--through time-servers,\nhucksters, and demagogues--that the voice of England is become no more\nthan the squeak of a halfpenny shoeblack, we might be glad to think\nof all our fathers did, at our expense, so grandly and heroically,\nif nations (trampled on for years, and but for England swept away)\nwould only take it as not a mortal injury that through us they\nlive. At any rate, many noble Spaniards in and round about Malaga\ncondescended to come and see the unloading of the British corvette,\n_Cleopatra-cum-Antonio_. She was the nimblest little craft (either\non or off a wind) of all ever captured from the French; and her name\nhad been reefed into _Clipater_ first, and then into _Clipper_, which\nstill holds way. And thus, in spite of all her money, she had run the\ngauntlet of Americans and Frenchmen, and lay on her keel discharging.\n\nLorraine regarded this process with his usual keen interest.\n\nThe scene was so new, and the people so strange, and their views of the\nworld so original, that he could not have tried to step into anything\nnobler and more refreshing. There was no such Babel of gesticulation\nas in a French harbour must have been; but there was plenty of little\nside-play, in and out among the natives, such as a visitor loves to\nwatch. And the dignity with which the Spaniards took the money into\ntheir charge was truly gratifying to the British mind. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey might\nhave said \u00e2\u0080\u0098Thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at any rate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Hilary, signing the bill\nof delivery, under three or four Spanish signatures. But that was no\nconcern of his.\n\nOne hundred thousand British guineas, even when they are given away,\nare not to be made light of. Their weight (without heeding the iron\nchests wherein they were packed in Threadneedle Street) perhaps was\nnot very much under a ton; and with the chests must have been nearly\ntwo tons. There were ten chests, thoroughly secured and sealed, each\ncontaining ten thousand guineas, and weighing about 4 cwt. All these\nwere delivered by the English agent to the deputy of Count Zamora,\nwho was accompanied by two members of the Junta of Seville, and the\nAlcaide of Cordova; and these great people, after no small parley, and\nwith the aid of Spanish officers, packed all the consignment into four\nmule-carts, and sent them under strong escort to head-quarters near\nCordova. Here the Count met them, and gave a receipt to Hilary for the\nSpanish subsidy, which very soon went the way of all money among the\nSpanish soldiers. And the next day the five less lucky mules, who were\ndragging the pay of the British army, went on with the five remaining\nchests--three in one cart and two in the other--still under Spanish\nescort, towards the slopes of the Sierra Morena.\n\nHilary, as usual, adapted himself to the tone and the humour around\nhim. The Spanish officers took to him kindly, and so did the soldiers,\nand even the mules. He was in great spirits once more, and kindly and\ncordially satisfied with himself. His conscience had pricked him for\nmany months concerning that affair with Claudia; but now it praised him\nfor behaving well, and returning to due allegiance. He still had some\nlittle misgiving about his vows to the Spanish maiden; but really he\ndid not believe that she would desire to enforce them. He was almost\nsure in his heart that the lovely young Donna did not care for him, but\nhad only been carried away for the moment, by her own warmth, and his\nstupid fervour. Tush! he now found himself a little too wide awake,\nand experienced in the ways of women, to be led astray by any of them.\nClaudia was a most beautiful girl, most fascinating, and seductive; but\nnow, if he only kept out of her way, as he meant most religiously to\ndo----\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe brave and renowned young captain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Count of Zamora,\nriding up in the fork of the valley where the mountain-road divided,\nand one branch led to his house, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill not, of course, disdain our\nhumble hospitality for the night?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear that it cannot be, dear Senhor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lorraine, with a lift\nof his hat in the Spanish manner, which he had caught to perfection;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cmy orders are to make all speed with the treasure, until I meet our\ndetachment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are responsible for the treasure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Count replied, with a smile\nof good-humour, and the slightest touch of haughtiness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cuntil you have\ncrossed the river upon the other side of our mountains. Senhor, is not\nthat enough? We have travelled far, and the mules are weary. Even if\nthe young captain prefers to bivouac in the open air, it is a proverb\nthat the noble English think more of their beasts than of themselves.\nAnd behold, even now the sun is low; and there are clouds impending!\nThe escort is under my orders as yet. If you refuse, I must exercise\nthe authority of the Junta.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat could Hilary do but yield? He was ordered to be at the Count\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndisposal; and thus the Count disposed of him. Nevertheless he\nstipulated that the convoy should pursue its course, as soon as the\nmoon had risen; for the night is better than the day for travelling, in\nthis prime of the southern year.\n\nSo the carts were brought into a walled quadrangle of the Monte\nArgento; and heavy gates were barred upon them, while the mules came\nout of harness, and stood happily round a heap of rye. The Spanish\nofficers, still in charge, were ready to be most convivial; and Hilary\nfell into their mood, with native compliance well cultivated. In a\nword, they all enjoyed themselves.\n\nOne alone, the star of all, the radiant, brilliant, lustrous one, the\nadmired of all admirers, that young Claudia, was sorrowful. Hilary, in\nthe gush of youthful spirits and promotion; in the glow of duty done\nand lofty standard satisfied; through all the pride of money paid by\nthe nation he belonged to; and even the glory of saying good things\nin a language slightly known to him;--Hilary caught from time to time\nthose grand reproachful eyes, and felt that they quite spoiled his\ndinner. And he was not even to get off like this.\n\nFor when he was going in the calmest manner, to order forth his carts,\nand march, with the full moon risen among the hills--the daintiest\nlittle note ever seen came into his hand, as softly as if it were\ndropped by a dove too young to coo. He knew that it came from a lady of\ncourse; and in the romantic place and time, his quick heart beat more\nquickly.\n\nThe writing was too fine for even his keen eyes by moonlight; but he\nmanaged to get to a quiet lamp, and there he read as follows: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have\nforgotten your vows to me. I must have an explanation. There is no\nchance of it in this house. My nurse has a daughter at the \u00e2\u0080\u0098bridge of\nechoes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 You know it, and you will have to cross it, within a league of\nyour journey. If I can escape, I shall be on that bridge in two hours\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ntime. You will wait for me there, if you are an English gentleman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis letter was unsigned, but of course it could only come from\nClaudia. Of all those conceited young Spanish officers, who had been\ncontradicting Lorraine, and even daring to argue with him, was there\none who would not have given his right hand, his gilt spurs, or even\nhis beard, to receive such a letter and such an appointment from the\ndaughter of the Count of Zamora?\n\nHilary fancied, as he said farewell, in the cumbrous mass of shadows\nand the foliage of the moonlight, that Donna Camilla (who came forth,\nwith a white mantilla fluttering) made signs, as if she longed, with\nall her heart, to speak to him. But the Count stood by, and the guests\nof the evening, and two or three mule-drivers cracking whips; and\nHilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horse turned on his tail, till the company kissed their hands\nto him. And thus he began to descend through trees, and rocks, and\nfreaks of shadow-land, enjoying the freshness of summer night, and the\ntranquil beauty of moonlit hills. Nickles and Bones, the two English\ntroopers, rode a little in advance of him, each of them leading a spare\nhorse, and keeping his eyes fixed stubbornly on the treasure-carts\nstill in the custody of the Spanish horsemen. For the Englishmen had\nbut little faith in the honesty of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthem palavering Dons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and regarded\nit as an affront, and a folly, that the treasure should be in their\ncharge at all.\n\nIn this order they came to the river Zujar, quite a small stream here\nat the foot of the mountains, and forming the boundary of the Count\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nestates. According to the compact with the Spaniards, and advices that\nday received, the convoy was here to be met by a squadron of horse from\nHill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s division; who at once would assume the charge of it, and be\nguided, as to their line of return, by Captain Lorraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggestions.\nAt the ford, however, there was no sign of any British detachment, and\nthe trumpeters sounded a flourish in vain.\n\nHilary felt rather puzzled by this; but his own duty could not be in\ndoubt. He must on no account allow the treasure-carts to pass the\nford, and so quit Spanish custody, until placed distinctly under\nBritish protection. And this he said clearly to the Spanish colonel,\nwho quite agreed with him on that point, and promised to halt until he\ngot word from Lorraine to move into the water. Then Bones and Nickles\nwere despatched to meet and hurry the expected squadron; for the\nSpanish troopers were growing impatient, and their discipline was but\nfortuitous.\n\nUnder these circumstances young Lorraine was sure that he might,\nwithout any neglect, spare just a few minutes, to do his duty\nelsewhere, as a gentleman. He felt that he might have appeared perhaps\nto play fast and loose with Claudia, although in his heart he was\npretty certain that she was doing that same with him. And now he\nintended to tell her the truth, and beg to be quit of a vow, whose\nrecall was more likely to gall than to grieve her.\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cbridge of echoes\u00e2\u0080\u009d was about a furlong above the ford, where the\nconvoy halted. It was an exceedingly ancient bridge, supposed to be\neven of Gothic date, and patched with Moorish workmanship. It stood\nlike a pack-saddle over the torrent, which roared from the mountains\nunder it; and it must have been of importance once, as commanding\napproach to the passes. For, besides two deep embrasures wherein\ndefenders might take shelter, it had (at the south or Morena end) a\nheavy fortalice beetling over, with a dangerous portcullis. And the\nwhole of it now was in bad repair, so that every flood or tempest\nworked it away, at the top or bottom; and capable as it was of light\ncarts or of heavy people, the officers were quite right in choosing to\nsend the treasure by the ford below.\n\nHilary proved that his sword was free to leap at a touch from its\nscabbard, ere ever he set foot on that time-worn, shadowy, venerable,\nand cut-throat bridge. The precaution perhaps was a wise one. But it\ncertainly did not at first sight exhibit any proof of true love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nconfidence in the maiden he was come to meet. It showed the difference\nbetween a wise love and a wild one; and Hilary smiled as he asked\nhimself whether he need have touched his sword, in coming to meet\nMabel. Then, half ashamed of himself, for such very low mistrust of\nClaudia, he boldly walked through the crumbling gateway, and up the\nsteep rise of the bridge.\n\nOn the peaked crown of the old arch he stood, and looked both up and\ndown the river. Towards the mountains there was nothing but loneliness\nand rugged shadow; scarred with clefts of moonlight, and at further\ndistance fringed with mist. And down the water, and the quiet sloping\nof the lowlands, everything was feeding on the comfort of the summer\nnight; the broad delicious calm of lying under nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s womanhood;\nwhen the rage of the masculine sun is gone, and fair hesitation comes\nafter it.\n\nHilary looked at all these things; but did not truly see them. He\ntook a general idea that the view was beautiful; and he might have\nbeen glad, at another time, to stand and think about it. For the\npresent, however, his time was short, and he must make the most of it.\nThe British detachment might appear at the ford, at any moment; and\nhis duty would be to haste thither at once, and see to the transfer\nof convoy. And to make sure of this, he had begged that the Spanish\ntrumpets might be sounded; while he kept his own horse waiting for him,\nand grazing kindly where the grass was cold.\n\nThe shadow of the old keep, and the ivy-mantled buttress, fell along\nthe roadway of the bridge, and lay in scollops there. Beyond it, every\nstone was clear (of facing or of parapet), and the age of each could be\nguessed almost, and its story, and its character. Even a beetle, or an\nearwig, must have had his doings traced, if an enemy were after him.\nBut under the eaves of the lamp of night, and within all the marge of\nthe glittering, there lay such darkness as never lies in the world,\nwhere the noon is less brilliant. Hilary stood in the broad light\nwaiting; and out of the shadow came Claudia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI doubted whether you would even do me the honour to meet me here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe said; \u00e2\u0080\u009coh, Hilary, how you are changed to me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have changed in no way, senhorita; except that I know when I am\nloved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you do not know--then you do not know--it does not become me to\nsay it, perhaps. Your ways are so different from ours, that you would\ndespise me if I told it all. I will not weep. No, I will not weep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith violent self-control, she raised her magnificent eyes to prove her\nwords; but the effort was too much for her. The great tears came, and\nglistened in the brilliance of the moonlight; but she would not show\nthem, only turned away; and wished that nobody in the world should know\nthe power of her emotions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary (for an Englishman always says \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome, come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwhen he is taken aback), \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou cannot mean half of this, of course.\nCome, Claudia; what can have made you take such a turn? You never used\nto do it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, I may have been fickle in the days gone by. But absence--absence\nis the power that proves----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark! I hear a sound down the river! Horses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feet, and wheels, and\nclashing----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; it is only the dashing of the water. I know it well. That is why\nthis bridge is called the \u00e2\u0080\u0098bridge of echoes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The water makes all sorts\nof sounds. Look here; and I will show you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took his hand, as she spoke, and led him away from the parapet\nfacing the ford to the one on the upper side of the bridge; when,\nsuddenly, such a faintness seized her, that she was obliged to cling to\nhim, as she hung over the low and crumbling wall. And how lovely she\nlooked in the moonlight, so pale, and pure, and perfect; and at the\nsame time so intensely feminine and helpless!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me fall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat does it matter, with no one in the\nworld to care for me? Hilary, let me fall, I implore you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat would be nice gratitude to the one who nursed me, and saved my\nlife. Senhorita, sit down, I pray you. Allow me to hold you. You are in\ngreat danger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, oh no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered faintly; as he was obliged to support her\nexquisite, but alas! too sensitive figure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I must not be embraced.\nOh, Hilary, how can you do such a thing to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can I help such a thing, you mean? How beautiful you are, Claudia!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the use of it? Alas! what is the use of it, if I am? When the\nonly one in all the world----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! There I heard that noise again. It is impossible that it can be\nthe water,--and I see horses, and the flash of arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, do not leave me! I shall fall into the torrent. For the sake\nof all the saints, stay one moment! How can I be found here? What\ninfamy!--at least, at least, swear one thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnything--anything. But I must be gone. I may be ruined in a moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so may I. In the name of the Saviour, swear not to tell that I met\nyou here. My father would kill me. You cannot even dream----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI swear that no power on earth shall make me say a word about you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I faint, I faint! Lay me there in the shadow. No one will see me.\nIt is the last time. O how cruel, how cold, how false! how bitterly\ncruel you are to me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a breath he whispered--for now he was in great stir,\nand hurry, and heard the Spanish trumpets sound, as he carried her\ntowards the shadow of the keep, and there for an instant leaned over\nher: \u00e2\u0080\u009cis it true that you love me, Claudia?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith my whole--oh, what do I say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as if she could not trust the\nechoes, she glanced at the corner timidly; \u00e2\u0080\u009coh, do not go, for one\nmoment, darling!--with every atom of my poor----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she was going to say, no doubt, but was spared the trouble;\nfor down fell Hilary, stunned by a crashing blow from that dark corner;\nand in a moment Alcides d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Alcar had him by the throat with gigantic\nhands, and planted one great knee on his breast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid I do it well?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Claudia, recovering bright activity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him see me. He never must know it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNeither that nor anything else shall he know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the brigand muttered,\nwith a furious grasp; until poor Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blue eyes started forth their\nsockets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou did it too well, my fair actress; so warmly, indeed, that\nI am quite jealous. The bottom of the Zujar is his marriage-couch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLoosen his throat, or I scream for his comrades. You promised me not\nto hurt him. He shall not be hurt more than we can help; although he\nhas been so faithless to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa, ha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d laughed the great brigand; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is no understanding the\ndelicate views of the females. But you shall be obeyed, beloved one. He\nwill come to himself in about ten minutes; these Englishmen have such a\nthickness of head. Search him; be quick; let me have his despatch-book.\nYou know where your lovers keep their things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSenseless though Hilary lay, the fair maiden kept herself out of the\nrange of his eyes, as her nimble fingers probed him. In a moment she\ndrew from an inner breast-pocket his private despatch-book, and Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nletter, and portrait. Those last she stowed away for her own revenge,\nafter glancing with great contempt at them; but the book she spread\nopen to her lover.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is noble!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, as the brilliant moonlight shone upon the\npages. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat could be more fortunate? Here are the blank forms with\nthe heading, and the flourish prepared for his signature. There is his\nmetal pencil. Now write as I tell you in Spanish, but with one or two\nlittle barbarisms; such as you know him given to. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The detachment is\nhere. I am holding them back. They are not to cross the water. Send the\ntwo carts through; but do not come yourselves. Good-night, and many\nthanks to you. May we soon meet again. (Signed) Hilary Lorraine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 You\nknow how very polite he is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is written, and in his own hand, most clearly. He has been my\npupil, and I have been his. Poor youth, I am very sorry for him. Now\nlet me go. Have I contented you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you at the chapel to-morrow night. I shall have the\ncleverest and most beautiful bride in all Iberia. How can I part with\nyou till then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will promise me not to hurt him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered through his\nbeard, as he clasped her warmly; while Hilary lay at their feet, still\nsenseless.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy all the saints that ever were, or will be, multiplied into all the\nangels! One kiss more, and then adieu, if it must be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe active young Claudia glided away; while the great brigand\nproceeded, with his usual composure, to arrange things to his liking.\nHe lifted poor Hilary, as if he were a doll, and bound him completely\nwith broad leather straps, which he buckled to their very tightest;\nand then he fixed over his mouth a scarf of the delicate wool of the\nmountains; and then he laid him in the shade; for he really was a\nmost honourable man, when honour came into bearing. And though (as far\nas his own feelings went) he would gladly have pitched this Captain\nLorraine into the rush of the Zujar, he had pledged his honour to\nClaudia. Therefore he only gagged and bound him, and laid him out of\nthe moonlight; which, at the time of year, might have maddened him.\nAfter this, Don Alcides d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Alcar struck flint upon punk, and lit a long\ncigar.\n\nThe whole of that country is full of fleas. The natives may say what\nthey like; but they only damage their credit by denying it, or prove\nto a charitable mind their own insensibility. The older the deposit or\nthe stratum is, the greater is the number of these active insects; and\nthis old bridge, whether Moorish, or Gothic, or even Roman (as some\ncontended), had an antiquarian stock of them.\n\nTherefore poor Hilary, coming to himself--as he was bound to do\nby-and-by--grew very uneasy, but obtained no relief through the natural\nsolace of scratching. He was strapped so tightly that he could only\nroll; and if he should be induced to roll a little injudiciously\nthrough a gap of the parapet he must go to the bottom of the lashing\nwater. Considering these things, he lay and listened; and though he\nheard many things which he disliked (and which bore a ruinous meaning\nto him for the rest of his young life, and all who loved him) he called\nhis high courage to his help; and being unable to talk to himself (from\nthe thickness of the wool between his teeth, which was a most dreadful\ndenial to him), he thought in his inner parts--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, if I die, there\nwill be no harm to say of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He laid this to his conscience, and in\ncontempt of all insects rolled off to sleep.\n\nThe uncontrollable outbreak of day, in the land where the sun is\nparamount, came like a cataract over the mountains, and scattered all\ndarkness with leaps of light. The winding valley and the wooded slope,\nthe white track of water, and the sombre cliffs, all sprang out of\ntheir vaporous mantle; and even the bridge of echoes looked a cheerful\nplace to lounge on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA bad job surely!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Corporal Nickles, marching with his footsteps\ncounted, as if he were a pedometer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBones, us haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t searched this\nhere ramshackle thing of a Spanish bridge. Wherever young Cap\u00e2\u0080\u0099en can\nbe, the Lord knows. At the bottom of the river, I dessay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter if he never was born,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Bones; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor leastwise now to be\na dead one. Fifty thousand guineas in a sweep! All cometh of trusting\nthem beggarly Dons. Corporal, what did I say to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike a horacle, you had foreseen it, sergeant. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099m all right,\nhowsomever it be. In our favour we has the hallerby.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary, waking, heard all this, and he managed to sputter so through\nthe wool, that the faithful non-commissioned officers ran to look for a\nwild sheep coughing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it all gone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked pretty calmly, when they had cut him free at\nlast, but he could not stand from stiffness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean to say that\nthe whole is gone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bones, with a solemn salute, which Nickles repeated as\njunior, \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery guinea are gone, as clean as a whistle; and the Lord\nknows where \u00e2\u0080\u0099em be gone to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, your honour, every blessed guinea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nickles, in\nconfirmation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo my mind it goes against the will of the Lord to have\nsuch a damned lot of money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a philosopher,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lorraine; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is pleasing to find\nsuch a view of the case. But as for me, I am a ruined man. No captain,\nnor even \u00e2\u0080\u0098your honour,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 any more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour honour must keep your spirits up. It mayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so bad as your\nhonour thinks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they answered very kindly, well knowing that he was a\nruined man, but saluting him all the more for it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nEMPTY LOCKERS.\n\n\nIt may perhaps be said, without any painful exaggeration, that\nthroughout the whole course of this grand war, struggle of great\ncaptains, and heroic business everywhere, few things made a deeper,\nsadder, and more sinister impression than the sudden disappearance\nof those fifty thousand guineas. On the other hand, it must not be\nsupposed that the disappearance of guineas was rare. Far otherwise--as\nmany people still alive can testify; and some of them perhaps with\ngratitude for their reappearance in the right quarter. But these\nparticular fifty thousand were looked out for in so many places, and\nhad so long been the subject of hope, as a really solid instalment of\na shilling in the pound for heroes, that the most philosophical of\nthese latter were inclined to use a short, strong word, of distinctive\nnationality.\n\nPoor Hilary felt that for this bad verb his own name must be the\nreceptive case; and he vainly looked about for any remedy or rescue.\nStiff as he was in the limbs, by reason of the straps of Don Alcides,\nand giddy of head from the staff of that most patriotic Spaniard, he\nfound it for some time a little hard to reflect as calmly as he should\nhave done. Indeed it was as much as he could do to mount his horse--who\n(unlike his master) had stuck to his post very steadfastly--and with\nsadness alike with soul and body to ride down to the fatal ford.\nSergeant-major Bones and Corporal Nickles also remounted and followed\nthe bewildered captain, keeping behind him at a proper distance for\nquiet interchange of opinion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCorporal, now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the sergeant-major, sliding his voice from\nbehind one hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat may be your sentiments as consarns this very\npecooliar and most misfortunate haxident?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSergeant, it would be misbehooving,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Nickles, who was a\nwest-country man, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas well as an onceremonious thing for me to spake\nfirst in the matter. To you it belongeth, being the one as foretold it\nlike a book; likewise senior hofficer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCorporal, you are a credit to the army. Your discretion, at your\nage, is wonderful. There be so few young men as remember when a man\nhas spoken right. I am the last man in the world to desire to be\noverpraised, or to take to myself any sense of it. And now I wants no\ncredit for it. To me it seems to come natteral to discern things in a\nsort of way that I find in nobody else a\u00e2\u0080\u0099most.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou doos, you doos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Corporal Nickles. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the time as\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said to myself--\u00e2\u0080\u0098Whur can I goo, to find sergeant-major, in this\nhere trick of the henemy?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And now, sergeant, what do \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee think of\nthis? No fear to tell truth in spaking \u00e2\u0080\u0099long of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCorporal, I have been thinking strongly ever since us untied him. And\nI have been brought up in the world so much, that I means to think\nagain of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, sergeant, you never means to say----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNickles, I means just what I means. I may be right, and yet again I\nmay be altogether wrong; as is the way of every man. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let me alone\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is\nall I say. But if I was sure as you could hold your tongue, I might\nhave something to say to you. Not of any account, you know; but still,\nsomething.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, sergeant, after all the thumps us has seen and been through\ntogether, you never would behave onhandsome to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCorporal Nickles, if you put it upon that footing, I cannot deny you.\nAnd mind you, now, my opinion is that this is a very queer case indeed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, now, to think of that! Why, sergeant, you ought to be a general!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNickles, no flattery; I am above it. Not but what I might have done so\nwell as other people, if the will of the Lord had been so. Consarning,\nhowever, of this to-do, and a precious rumpus it will be, my opinion is\nthat we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know half.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSpeaking thus, the sergeant nodded to the corporal impressively, and\njerked his thumb towards the captain in front, and winked, and then\nbegan again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, corporal, my place is to keep both eyes wide open. There was\na many things as struck me up at the old Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yonder. A carrying on\nin corners, and a going to lamps to read things, and a winking out of\nyoung ladies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eyes, to my mind most unmilitary. But I might a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought\nthat was all young people, and a handsome young chap going on as they\nwill, only for what one of they dirty devils as drives them mules have\nsaid to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, now, sergeant; never, now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs true as I sit this here hoss, when us come back with the sun\ngetting up, what did that pagan say to me? You seed him, corporal,\na-running up, and you might have saved me the trouble, only you was\nnodding forward. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Senhor captain,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said to me, and the whites of his\neyes was full of truth, \u00e2\u0080\u0098the young cavalier has been too soft.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 That\nwas how I made out his country gibberish; the stuff they poor beggars\nare born to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt gooeth again the grain of my skin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Corporal Nickles answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto\nharken them fellows chattering. But sergeant, what did he say next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, they may chatter, or hold their tongues, to them as cannot\nunderstand them. Requireth a gift, which is a denial to most folk, to\nunderstand them. And what he said, Corporal Nickles, was this--that he\nwas coming up the river, while the carts was waiting, and afore the\nrobbery, mind you; and he seed a young woman come on to the bridge--you\nknows how they goes, corporal, when they expects you to look after\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSergeant, I should think so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, she come on the bridge for all the world like that. Us have seen\nit fifty times. And she had a white handkercher on her head, or an\nIshmaelitish mantle; and she were looking out for some young chap. And\nour young cap\u00e2\u0080\u0099en come after her. And who do you think she were? Why,\none of the daughters of the old Don up yonner!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood heart alaive, now, Sergeant Bones, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a\u00e2\u0080\u0099most belave it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNickles, I tell you what was told me--word for word; and I say no\nmore. But knowing what the ways of the women is, as us dragoons is so\nforced to do, even after a marriage and family----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, sergeant, sergeant! we tries in vain to keep inside the strick\nline of dooty. I does whatever a man can do; and my father were a\nbutcher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCorporal, it is one of the trials which the Lord has ordered. They do\nlook up at one so, and they puts the middle of their lips up, and then\nwith their bodies they turns away, as if there was nothing to look at.\nBut, Nickles, they gives you no sort of a chance to come to the bottom\nof them. And this is what young cap\u00e2\u0080\u0099en will find out. The good females\nalways is found out at last; the same as my poor wife was. But here\nus are. We have relaxed the bonds of discipline with conversation.\nCorporal, eyes right, and wait orders!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile these two trusty and veteran fellows had been discussing a\nsubject far too deep for a whole brigade of them, and still were full\nof tender recollections (dashed with good escape), poor Hilary had\nbeen vainly spurring, here and there, and all about, himself not come\nto his clear mind yet, only hoping to know where the money was gone.\nHope, however, upon that point was disappointed, as usual. The track\nof the heavy carts was clear in the gravel of the river, and up the\nrocky bank, and on the old Roman road towards Merida. And then, at\nthe distance of about a furlong from the Zujar, the rut of the wooden\nwheels turned sharply into an elbow of a mountain-road. Here, on the\nhump of a difficult rise, were marks, as if many kicks, and pricks, and\neven stabs, had been ministered to good mules labouring heavily. There\nwas blood on the road, and the blue shine of friction, where hard rock\nencountered hard iron, and the scraping of holes in gravelly spots,\nand the nicks of big stones laid behind wheels to ease the tugging,\nand afford the short relief of panting. These traces were plain, and\nbecoming plainer as the road grew worse, for nearly a mile of the\nmountain-side, and then the track turned suddenly into a thicket of\ndark ilex, where, out of British sight and ken, the spoil had been\ndivided.\n\nThe treasure-carts had been upset, and two of the sturdy mules, at last\nfoundered with hard labour, lay in their blood, contented that their\nwork was over, and that man (a greater brute than themselves) had taken\nall he wanted out of them. The rest had been driven or ridden on, being\nuseful for further torment. And here on the ground were five stout\ncoffers of good British iron; but, alas! the good British gold was\nflown.\n\nAt this sight, Hilary stared a little; and the five chests in the\nmorning sun glanced back at him with such a ludicrously sad expression\nof emptiness, that, in spite of all his trouble, the poor young captain\nbroke into a hearty laugh. Then his horse walked up, and sniffed at\nthem, being reminded, perhaps, of his manger; and Hilary, dismounting,\nfound a solitary guinea lying in the dust, the last of fifty thousand.\nThe trail of coarse esparto bags, into which the gold had been poured\nfrom the coffers, for the sake of easier transport, was very distinct\nin the parts untrampled by horses, mules, or brigands. But of all the\nmarks there was none more conspicuous than the impressions of some\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boots, larger and heavier than the rest, and appearing, over and\nover again, here, there, and everywhere. For a few yards up the rugged\nmountain, these and other footprints might be traced without much\ntrouble, till suddenly they dispersed, grew fainter, and then wholly\ndisappeared in trackless, hopeless, and (to a stranger) impenetrable\nforest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou honest guinea that would not be stolen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried poor Lorraine,\nas he returned and picked up the one remaining coin; \u00e2\u0080\u009chaply I shall\nnever own another honest guinea. Forty-nine thousand nine hundred and\nninety-nine prefer the ownership of rogues. Last of guineas, we will\nnot part till gold outlives humanity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, sir, is there anything us can do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Bones and Nickles, or\none of them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe has followed all the way up this here long hill, for\nwant of better orders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my good fellows, there is nothing to be done. We cannot follow any\nfurther. I must go with all speed to report myself. Follow me, if you\ncan keep up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe sergeant nodded to the corporal--for, loyal and steadfast as they\nwere, suspicion was at work with them; that ugly worm which, once set\ngoing, wriggles into the stoutest heart. Surely it was a queer thing\nof the captain not even to let them examine the spot; but order was\norder, and without a word they followed the young officer back to the\nhigh road, and then, for some hours in the heat of the day, on the way\ntowards Estremadura. At noontide they came to a bright, broad stream,\nknown to them as the Guadalmez, a confluent of the Guadiana; and here\nthey were challenged, to their great surprise, by a strong detachment\nof British hussars.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is your duty here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Lorraine, as his uniform and face were\nacknowledged and saluted by sentries posted across the ford.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo receive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried an officer, riding through the river (for all\nof these people were wide awake), \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Lorraine and his Spanish\nconvoy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no convoy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, dropping his voice into very sad\nmusic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll is lost. It is partly your fault. You were ordered to meet\nme at the Zujar ford.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the Zujar ford,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the cavalry major answered, sternly; and\nHilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart fell from its last hope of recovering anything.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been here these three days waiting for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the\nmajor, with vehemence; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have lost all our chance of a glorious\nbrush; we sent you advice that we were waiting for you. And now you\nappear without your convoy! Captain Lorraine, what does all this mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMajor, my explanation is due at head-quarters, rather than to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd a deuced hard job you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to give it, or my name\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not\nM\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rustie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the senior officer muttered, with more terseness and truth\nthan courtesy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m blessed if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d stand in your shoes before Old Beaky\nfor a trifle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPoor Hilary tried in vain to look as if he took it lightly. Even his\nbright and buoyant nature could not lift head against the sea of\ntroubles all in front of him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have done no harm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he kept saying to himself, when, after the\nfew words that duty demanded, he urged his stout horse forward; and\nthe faithful sergeant and corporal, who had shunned all inquisitive\nhussars, spurred vigorously after him, feeling themselves (as a Briton\nloves to feel himself) pregnant with mighty evidence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat harm have\nI done?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Hilary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw to everything; I worked hard. I never\nquitted my post, except through duty towards a lady. Any gentleman\nmust have done what I did. To be an officer is an accident; to be a\ngentleman is a necessity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you felt altogether,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said conscience to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe necessity\nof that necessity? Have you found it impossible to depart from a\ngentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first duty--good faith to those who trust in him? When you\nfound yourself bewitched with a foreign lady, did you even let your\nfirst love know it? For months you have been playing fast and loose,\nnot caring what misery you caused. And now you are fast in the trap of\nyour looseness. Whatever happens serves you right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever happens serves me right!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary Lorraine, aloud, as he\nlifted his sword just a little way forth, for the last time to admire\nit, and into the sheath dropped a quick, hot tear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have done my duty\nas an officer badly; and as a gentleman far worse. But, Mabel, if you\ncould see me now, I think that you would forgive me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe felt his heart grow warm again with the thought of his own Mabel;\nand in the courage of that thought, he stood before Lord Wellington.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nBE NO MORE OFFICER OF MINE.\n\n\nThe hero of a hundred fights (otherwise called \u00e2\u0080\u009cOld Beaky\u00e2\u0080\u009d) had just\nscraped through a choking trouble on the score of money with the\ngrasping Portuguese regency; and now, in the year 1813, he was busier\nthan even he had ever found himself before. He had to combine, in most\ndelicate manner, and with exquisite nicety of time, the movements of\ncolumns whose number scarcely even to himself was clear; for the force\nof rivers unusually strong, and the doubt of bridges successively\nbroken, and the hardship of the Tras os Montes, and the scattering of\nsoldiers, who for want of money had to \u00e2\u0080\u009csubsist themselves\u00e2\u0080\u009d--which\nmeans to hunt far afield after cows, sheep, and hens--also the\nshifty and unpronounced tactics of the enemy, and a great many other\ndisturbing elements, enough to make calculation sea-sick,--a senior\nwrangler, or even Herr Steinitz (the Wellington of the chess-board),\neach in his province, might go astray, and trust at last to luck itself\nto cut the tangled knot for him.\n\nIt was a very grand movement, and triumphantly successful; opening up\nas fine a march as can be found in history, sweeping onward in victory,\nand closing with conquest of the Frenchmen in their own France, and\nnothing left to stop the advance on Paris. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWas all this luck, or was\nit skill?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the historian asks in wonder; and the answer, perhaps, may\nbe found in the proverb--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLuck has a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love for skill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBe that as it may, it is quite certain that Hilary, though he had\nshown no skill, had some little luck in the present case. For the\nCommander-in-Chief was a great deal too busy, and had all his officers\ntoo hard at work, to order, without fatal loss of time, a general\ncourt-martial now. Moreover, he had his own reasons for keeping the\nmatter as quiet as possible, for at least another fortnight. Every\nsoldier by that time would be in march, and unable to turn his back on\nBrown Bess: whereas now there were some who might lawfully cast away\nthe knapsack, if they knew that their bounty was again no better than\na cloudy hope. And, again, there were some ugly pot-hooks of English\nquestions to be dealt with.\n\nAll these things passed through the rapid mind of the General, as he\nreined his horse, and listened calmly to poor Lorraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over-true\nreport. And then he fixed his keen grey eyes upon Hilary, and said\nshortly--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat were you doing upon that bridge?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is a question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Lorraine, while marvelling at his own\naudacity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich I am pledged by my honour, as a gentleman, not to\nanswer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy your duty as an officer, in a place of special trust, you are bound\nto answer it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGeneral, I cannot. My lord, as I rather must call you now, I wish I\ncould answer; but I cannot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have no suspicion who it was that stole the money, with so much\ncare?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a suspicion, but nothing more; and it makes me feel\ntreacherous, to suspect it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind that. We have rogues to deal with. What is your suspicion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, I am sorry to say that again I cannot, in honour, answer you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Lorraine, I have no time to spare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lord Wellington had been\nmore than once interrupted by despatches. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce and for all, do you\nmean to give any, or no explanation of your conduct, in losing \u00c2\u00a350,000?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGeneral, all my life, and the honour of my family, depend upon what I\ndo now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen go and seek advice, Lorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the General answered kindly, for\nhis heart was kind; and he had taken a liking for this young fellow,\nand knew a little of his family.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no one to go to for advice, my lord. What is your advice to\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d With these words, Hilary looked so wretched and yet so proud from\nhis well-bred face, and beautifully-shaped blue eyes, that his General\nstopped from his hurry to pity him. And then he looked gently at the\npoor young fellow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the most irregular state of things I have ever had to deal\nwith. You have lost a month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pay of our army, and enough to last them\nhalf a year; and you seem to think that you have done great things,\nand refuse all explanation. Is there any chance of recovering the\nmoney?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere might be, my lord, if we were not likely to advance too rapidly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere might be, if we threw away our campaign! You have two courses\nbefore you; at least, if I choose to offer them. Will you take my\nadvice, if I offer the choice?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am only too glad to have any choice; and anything chosen for me by\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen this is just how you stand, Lorraine--if we allow the\nalternative. You may demand a court-martial, or you may resign your\ncommission. On the other hand, as you know, a court-martial should at\nonce be held upon you. What answer are you prepared to make, when asked\nwhy you left your convoy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should be more stubborn to them than even your lordship has let me\nbe to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, Captain Lorraine, resign your commission. With my approval it\ncan be done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cResign my commission!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lorraine exclaimed, reeling as if he had\nreceived a shot, and catching at the mane of the General\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horse,\nwithout knowing what he was doing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, I never could do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well. I have given you my advice. You prefer your own decision;\nand I have other things to attend to. Captain Money will receive your\nsword. You are under arrest, till we can form a court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, it would break my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart, if he were to hear of such\na thing. I suppose I had better resign my commission, if I may.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut that in writing, and send it to me. I will forward it to the Horse\nGuards with a memorandum from myself. I am sorry to lose you, Captain\nLorraine: you might have done well, if you had only proved as sensible\nas you are active and gallant. But one word more--what made you stop\nshort at the ford of a little mountain-stream? I chose you as knowing\nthe country well. You must have known that the Zujar ford was twenty\nmiles further on your road.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know all that country too well, my lord. We halted at the real Zujar\nford. General Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s detachment stopped at the ford of the Guadalmez.\nThat is wrongly called the Zujar there. The Zujar has taken a great\nsweep to the east, and fallen into the Guadalmez and Guadalemar. Major\nM\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rustie must have been misled; and no doubt it was done on purpose. I\nhave my information on the very best authority.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I ask, upon what authority? Are you pledged in honour to conceal\neven that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I may tell that, I do believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, after one moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthought, and with his old bright simple smile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had it, my lord,\nfrom the two young ladies--the daughters of the Count of Zamora.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Lord Wellington (being almost as fond of young ladies as\nthey of him, and touched perhaps for a moment by the magic of a sweet\nyoung smile,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cI begin to understand the bridge affair. But I fear\nthat young ladies can hardly be cited as authorities on geography.\nOtherwise, we might make out a case against the Spanish authorities for\nsending our escort to the wrong place. And the Spanish escort, as you\nsay, took the other for the proper place?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly, my lord, they did. And so did the Count, and everybody. Is\nthere any hope now that I may be acquitted?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notice from Hope that she would like to come back to her\nlodgings, Hilary opened his eyes so wide, and his heart so wide, and\nevery other place that hope is generally partial to, that the great\ncommander (who trusted as little, as possible, of his work to hope)\ncould not help smiling a quick, dry smile. And he felt some pain, as,\nword by word, he demolished hope in Hilary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe point of the thing is the money, Lorraine. And that we never could\nrecover from the Spaniards, even if it was lost through them; for the\nvery good reason that they have not got it. And even supposing the\nmistake to be theirs, and our escort to have been sent astray; you were\na party to that mistake. And more than that; you were bound to see that\nthe treasure did not cross the river, until our men were there. Did you\ndo so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, if I only had done that, I should not be so miserable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExactly so. You neglected your duty. Take more care of your own money\nthan you have taken of the public cash, Lorraine. Do as I told you. And\nnow, good-bye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe General, who had long been chafing at so much discourse just now,\noffered his hand to Lorraine, as one who was now a mere civilian.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs there no hope?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Hilary, dropping a tear into the mane of the\nrestive horse. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan I never be restored, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever! unless the money is made good, before we go into quarters\nagain. A heavy price for a captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commission!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it is made good, my lord, will you restore me from this deep\ndisgrace?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe question will be for his Royal Highness. But I think that in such\nan extraordinary case, you may rely--at any rate you may rely upon my\ngood word, Lorraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you, my lord. The money shall be paid. Not for the sake of my\ncommission, but for the honour of our family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nFAREWELL, ALL YOU SPANISH LADIES.\n\n\nThe British army now set forth on its grand career of victory, with\nan entirely new set of breeches. Interception of convoys, and other\nadverse circumstances, had kept our heroes from having any money,\nalthough they had new pockets. And the British Government, with keen\ninsight into nature, had insisted upon it, in the last contract, that\nthe pockets should be all four inches wide. With this the soldiers\nwere delighted--for all the very bravest men are boys--and they put\ntheir knuckles into their pockets, and felt what a lot of money they\nwould hold. And though the money did not come, there was the delightful\nreadiness for it. It might come any day, for all they knew: and what\nfools they must have looked, if their pockets would not hold it! In\nshort, these men laid on their legs, to march with empty pockets;\nand march they did, as history shows, all the better for not having\nsixpence.\n\nThough Hilary was so heartily liked, both in his own regiment and\nby the Staff, time (which had failed for his trial) also failed for\npity of the issue. The General had desired that as little as possible\nshould be said; and even if any one had wished to argue, the hurry\nand bustle would have stopped his mouth. Lorraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old comrades were\nfar in advance; and the Staff, like a shuttle, was darting about;\nand the hills and the valleys were clapping their hands to the happy\naccompaniment of the drum.\n\nCasting by every outward sign that he ever had been a soldier, Hilary\nLorraine set forth on his sad retreat from this fine advance; afoot,\nand bearing on his shoulder a canvas bag on a truncheon of olive.\nHe would not accept any knapsack, pouch, or soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usage of any\nkind. He had lost all right to that, being now but a shattered young\ngentleman on his way home.\n\nHowever, in one way he showed good sense. By losing such a heap of the\npublic money, he had learned to look a little better after his own; so\nhe drew every farthing that he could get of his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cash and his\ngrandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, but scorned to accept the arrears of his pay; because he\ncould not get them.\n\nTo a man of old, or of middle age, it has become (or it ought to\nbecome), a matter of very small account that he has thrown away his\nlife. He has seen so many who have done the like (through indolence,\npride, bad temper, reserve, timidity, or fools\u00e2\u0080\u0099 confidence--into which\nthe most timid men generally rush), that he knows himself now to be a\nfine example, instead of standing forth as a very unpleasant exception\nto the rule. And now, if he takes it altogether, he finds many fellows\nwho have done much worse, and seem all the better for it. Has he missed\nan appointment! They cut down the salary. Did he bang his back-door on\na rising man? Well, the man, since he rose, has forgotten his hosts.\nHas he married a shrew? She looks after his kitchen. Remembering and\nreflecting thus, almost any good man must refuse to be called, without\nsomething to show for it, a bigger fool than his neighbours.\n\nBut a young man is not yet late enough to know what human life is. He\nis sure that he sees by foresight all the things which, as they pass\nus, leave so little time for insight; and of which the only true view\nis calm and pleasant retrospect. And then, like some high-stepping colt\nbrought suddenly on his knees, to a sense of long-worn granite, he\nflounders about in amazement, so, that if the fatal damage is not done\nto him, he does it.\n\nLorraine was not one of those who cry, as the poets of all present\nages do--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet the world stand still, until I get on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nevertheless, he\nwas greatly downcast to find his own little world so early brought to\na sudden stand-still. And it seems to be sadly true that the more of\nversatile quickness a man has in him, the less there remains to expect\nof him in the way of pith and substance. But Hilary now was in no\ncondition to go into any philosophies. He made up his mind to walk down\nto the sea, and take ship at some good seaport; and having been pleased\nat Malaga by the kind quiet ways of the people, and knowing the port to\nbe unobserved by French and American cruisers, he thought that he might\nas well try his luck once more in that direction.\n\nSwift of foot as he was, and lightsome when his heart was toward, he\ndid not get along very fast on his penitential journey. So that it\nwas the ninth day, or the tenth, from his being turned out of the\narmy, when he came once more to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBridge of Echoes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d henceforth\nhis \u00e2\u0080\u009cBridge of Sighs\u00e2\u0080\u009d for ever. Here he stopped and ate his supper,\nfor his appetite was good again; and then he looked up and down the\nZujar, and said to himself what a fool he was. For lo! where Claudia\nhad clung to him trembling over a fearful abyss of torrent (as it\nseemed by moonlight), there now was no more than nine inches of water\ngliding along very pleasantly. These Spanish waters were out of his\nknowledge, as much as the Spanish ladies were; but though the springs\nmight have been much higher a fortnight ago than they were now, Hilary\ncould not help thinking that Claudia, instead of fainting on the verge,\nmight have jumped over, at any moment, without spraining her very neat\nankles. And then he remembered that it was this same beautiful and\nromantic girl who had proved to the satisfaction of the Spanish Colonel\nthat this was the only Zujar ford, for that river merged its name\nwhere it joined the longer and larger Guadalmez. Upon this question\nthere long had arisen a hopeful dilemma in Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, which stated\nitself in this form. If this were the true Zujar ford, then surely the\nSpaniards, the natives of the country, were bound to apprise General\nHill thereof. If this were not the Zujar ford, then the Spaniards\nwere liable for the treasure beyond this place, and as far as the\ntrue one. The latter was of course the stronger horn of the dilemma;\nbut unluckily there arose against it a mighty monster of fact, quite\nstrong enough to take even the Minotaur by the horns. Suppose the brave\nSpaniards to owe the money, it was impossible to suppose that they\ncould pay it.\n\nThis reflection gave Hilary such a pain in his side that he straightway\ndropped it. And beholding the vivid summer sky beginning to darken\ninto deeper blue, and the juts of the mountainous places preparing to\nthrow light and shadow length-wise, and the simmering of the sun-heat\nsinking into white mists of the vales, he made up his mind to put best\nfoot foremost, and sleep at Monte Argento. For he felt quite sure of\nthe goodwill and sympathy of that pure hidalgo, the noble Count of\nZamora; and from the young Donnas he might learn something about his\nmisadventure. He could not bring himself to believe that Claudia had\nbeen privy to the dastardly outrage upon himself. His nature was too\nfrank and open to foster such mean ideas. Young ladies were the best\nand sweetest, the kindest and the largest-hearted, of created beings.\nSo they were, and so they are; but all rules have exceptions.\n\nHilary, as he walked up the hill (down which he had ridden so\ngallantly, scarcely more than a fortnight since), was touched with\nmany thinkings. The fall of the sun (which falls and rises over us so\nmagnanimously) had that power upon his body which it has on all things.\nThe sun was going; he had done his work, and was tired of looking at\npeople: mount as you might, the sun was sinking, and disdained all\nshadows and oblation of memorial.\n\nThrough the growth of darkness thus, and the urgency of froward trees\n(that could not fold their arms and go to sleep without some rustling),\nand all the many quiet sounds that nurse the repose of evening,\nLorraine came to the heavy gates that had once secured the money. The\nporter knew him, and was glad to let in the young British officer,\nwhose dollars leaping right and left had made him many household\nfriends. But in the hall the old steward met him, and with many grave\ninclinations of his head and body, mourned that he could not receive\nthe illustrious Senhor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is in the castle no one now, but my noble mistress the Donna\nCamilla. His Excellence the Count is away, far from home at the wars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the young Lady Claudia, where is she? I beg your pardon, steward,\nif I ought not to ask the question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor the ancient steward had turned away at the sound of Donna Claudia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nname; and pretending to be very deaf, began to trim a lamp or two.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill the Donna Camilla permit me to see her for one minute, or two\nperhaps? Her father is from home; but you, Senhor steward, know what is\ncorrect, and thus will act.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary had not been so frightened at his own temerity in the deadly\nbreach of Badajos, as now when he felt himself softly slipping a brace\nof humble English guineas into this lofty Spaniard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s palm. The steward,\nwithout knowing what he was about, except that he was trimming a very\nstubborn lamp, felt with his thumb that there must be a brace, and with\ncontemptuous indignation let them slide into his pocket.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenhor, I will do only what is right. I am of fifty years almost in\nthis noble family. I am trusted, as I deserve. What I do is what the\nCount himself would do. But a very sad thing has happened. We are\nobliged now to be most careful. The Senhor knows what the ladies are?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenhor steward, that is the very thing that I never do know. You know\nthem well. But alas! I do not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! I do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the steward, panting, and longing to pour forth\nexperience; but he saw some women peeping down stairs, and took the\nupper hand of them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenhor, it is not worth the knowing. Our affairs\nare loftier. Go back, all you women, and prepare for bed. Have you not\nhad your supper? Now, Senhor, in here for a minute, if you please;\npatience passeth all things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patience itself was passed, as he waited in this little\nante-room, ere the steward returned with the Donna Camilla, and, with a\nlow bow, showed her in, and posted himself in a corner. She was dressed\nin pure white, which Hilary knew to be the mourning costume of the\nfamily.\n\nThe hand which the young Andalusian lady offered was cold and\ntrembling, and her aspect and manner were timid and abashed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBegone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried to the worthy steward, with a sudden indignation,\nwhich perhaps relieved her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat now shall I do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the steward to\nhimself, with one hand spread upon his silver beard; \u00e2\u0080\u009cis this one also\nto run away?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBegone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Camilla to him once more, looking so grand that he could\nonly go; and then quietly bolting the old gentleman out. After which\nshe returned to Hilary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenhor Captain, I am very sorry to offer you any scenes of force. You\nhave had too many from our family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not understand you, Senhorita. From your family I have received\nnothing but kindness, hospitality, and love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas, Senhor! and heavy blows. Our proverb is, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Love leads to blows;\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nand this was our return to you. But she is of our family no more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am at a loss. It is my stupidity. I do not know at all what is meant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn sincerity, the cavalier has no suspicion who smote down and robbed\nhim?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn sincerity, the cavalier knows not: although he would be very glad\nto know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it possible? Oh the dark treachery! It was my cousin who struck you\ndown; my sister who betrayed you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lorraine, in a moment, seeing how she trembled for his\nwords, and how terribly she felt the shame; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it be so, I am still\nin her debt. She saved my life once, and she spared it again. Now, as\nyou see, I am none the worse. The only loser is the British Government,\nwhich can well afford to pay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not so. The loss is ours, of honour, faith, and gratitude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you not to take it so. Everybody knows that the fault was mine.\nAnd whatever has happened only served me right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt served you right for trusting us! It is too true. It is a bitter\nsaying. My father mourns, and I mourn. She never more will be his\ndaughter, and never more my sister.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, taking her hand, as she turned away to\ncontrol herself--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you, Donna Camilla, to look at this little\nmatter sensibly. I now understand the whole of it. Your sister is of\nvery warm and strong patriotic sentiments. She felt that this money\nwould do more good, as the property of the _partidas_, than as the pay\nof the British troops. And so she exerted herself to get it. All good\nSpaniards would have thought the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe exerted herself to disgrace herself, and to disgrace her family.\nThe money is not among the _partidas_, but all in the bags of her\nCousin Alcides, whom she has married without dispensation, and with her\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sanction forged. Can you make the best of that, Senhor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary certainly could not make anything very good out of this. And\ncheerful though his nature was, and tolerably magnanimous, he could not\nbe expected to enjoy the treatment he had met with. To be knocked down\nand robbed was bad enough; to be disgraced was a great deal worse; but\nto be cut out by a rival, betrayed into his power, and made to pay for\nhis wedding with trust-money belonging to poor soldiers,--all this was\nenough to embitter even the sweet and kind nature of young Lorraine.\nTherefore his face was unlike itself, as he turned it away from the\nyoung Spanish lady, being much taken up with his own troubles, and not\nyet ready to make light of them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you not speak to me, Senhor? I am not in any way guilty of this.\nI would have surrendered the whole of my life----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI pray you to pardon me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hilary answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not accustomed to\nthis sort of thing. Where are they now? Can I follow them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven a Spaniard could not find them. My brothers would not attempt\nit. Alcides knows every in and out. He has hidden his prize in the\nmountains of the north.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that is so, I can only hasten to say farewell to the Spanish land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo go away, and to never come back! Is it possible that you could do\nthat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be a bitter thing; but I must try. I am now on my way to\nMalaga. Being discharged from the British army, I have only to find my\nown way home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt cannot be; it never can be! Our officers lose a mule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-load of\nmoney, or spend it at cards; and we keep them still. Senhor Captain,\nyou must have made some mistake. They never could discharge you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there has been any mistake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, regaining his sweet\nsmile, with his sense of humour, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is on their part, not on mine.\nDischarged I am; and the British army, as well as the Spanish cause,\nmust do their best to get on without me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaints of heaven! And you will go, and never come back any more?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the help of the saints, that is my hope. What other hope is left\nto me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCamilla de Montalvan did not answer this question with her lips, but\nmore than answered it with her eyes. She fell back suddenly, as if with\nterror, into a great blue velvet chair, and her black tresses lay on\nher snowy arms, although her shapely neck reclined. Then with a gentle\nsigh, as if recovering from a troubled dream, she raised her eyes to\nHilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and let them dwell there long enough to make him wonder where\nhe was. And he saw that he had but to speak the word to become the\nowner of grace and beauty, wealth, and rank in the Spanish army, and\n(at least for a time) true love.\n\nBut, alas! a burned child dreads the fire. There still was a bump on\nLorraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head from the staff of Don Alcides; and Camilla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were\ntoo like Claudia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to be trusted all at once. Moreover, Hilary thought\nof Mabel, of all her goodness, and proven trust; and Spanish ladies,\nthough they might be queens, had no temptation for him now. And perhaps\nhe thought--as quick men think of little things unpleasantly--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not\nwant a wife whose eyes will always be deeper than my own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And so he\nresolved to be off as soon as it could be done politely.\n\nCamilla, having been disappointed more than once of love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reply,\nclearly saw what was going on, and called her pride to the rescue.\nThe cavalier should not say farewell to her; she would say it to the\ncavalier. Also, she would let him know one thing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you must leave us, Captain Lorraine, and return to your native\nland, you will at least permit me to do what my father would have done\nif he were at home--to send you with escort to Malaga. The roads are\ndangerous. You must not go alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you. I am scarcely worth robbing now. I can sing in the\npresence of the bandit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will grant me this last favour, I am sure, if I tell you one\nthing. It was not that wicked Claudia, who drew the iron from your\nwound.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was not the Donna Claudia! To whom then do I owe my life?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you not, by any means, endeavour to conjecture?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow glad I am?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, as he kissed her cold and trembling\nhand--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe lady to whom I owe my life is gentle, good, and truthful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no debt of life, Senhor. But would it have grieved you,\nnow, if Claudia had done it? Then be assured she did not do it. Her\nmanner never was to do anything good to anyone. And yet--how wonderful\nare things!--everybody loved her. It is no good to be good, I fear.\nPedro, you are at the door, then, are you? You have taken care to hear\neverything. Go order a repast for the cavalier of the best we have,\nand men and horses to conduct him to Malaga. Be quick, I say, and show\nno hesitation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At her urgent words the steward went, yet grumbling\nand reluctant, and glancing over his shoulder all the way along the\npassage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow that old man amuses me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued to the wondering\nHilary, who had never dreamed that she could speak sharply; \u00e2\u0080\u009cever since\nmy sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disgrace, he thinks that his duty is to watch me! Ah! what\nam I to be watched for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is no Spaniard who would not long to\nsteal the beautiful young Donna.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo Spaniard shall ever do that. But haste; you are in such hurry for\nthe sunny land of Anglia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not understand the Senhorita. Why should I hurry to my great\ndisgrace? I shall never hear the last of the money I have lost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis all money, money, money, in the noble England. But the friends of\nthe Captain need not mourn; for the money was not his, nor theirs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis grandly philosophical, and most truly Spanish, view of the\ncase destroyed poor Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last fond hope of any sense of a debt\nof honour, on the part of the Montalvans. If the money lost had\nbeen Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, the Count of Zamora (all compact of chivalry and\nrectitude) might have discovered that he was bound to redeem his\ndaughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s robbery. But as it stood, there was no such chance. Private\nhonour is a mountain rill that does not always lead to any lake of\npublic honesty. All Spaniards would bow to the will of the Lord, that\nBritish guineas should slip into Spanish hands so providentially.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not take things just so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said young Lorraine quite sadly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nmust go home and restore the money. Donna Camilla, I must say farewell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will come again when you are restored? When you have proved that\nyou did not take the money for yourself, Senhor, you will remember your\nSpanish friends?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never shall forget my Spanish friends. To you I owe my life, and\nhold it (as long as I hold it) at your command.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is generously said, Senhor. Generosity always makes me weep. And\nso, farewell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nGOING UP THE TREE.\n\n\nIn all the British army--then a walking wood of British oak, without a\nyard of sapling--there was no bit of better stuff than the five feet\nand a quarter (allowing for his good game leg) of Major, by this time\nColonel Clumps. This officer knew what he had to do, and he made a\npoint of doing it. Being short of imagination, he despised that foolish\ngift, and marvelled over and over again at others for laughing so at\nnothing. That whimsical tickling of the veins of thought, which some\npeople give so and some receive (with equal delight on either side),\nhumour, or wit, or whatever it is, to Colonel Clumps was a vicious\nthing. Everything must be either true or false. If it were true, who\ncould laugh at the truth? If it were false, who should laugh at a\nfalsehood?\n\nMany a good man has reasoned thus, reducing laughter under law, and\nhimself thenceforth abandoned by that lawless element. Colonel Clumps\nhad always taken solid views of everything, and the longer he lived in\nthe world the less he felt inclined to laugh at it. But, that laughter\nmight not be robbed of all its dues and royalties, just nature had\nprovided that, as the Colonel would not laugh at the world, the world\nshould laugh at the Colonel. He had been the subject of more bad jokes,\none-sided pleasantries, and heartless hoaxes, than any other man in\nthe army; with the usual result that now he scarcely ever believed the\ntruth, while he still retained, for the pleasure of his friends, a\ntempting stock of his native confidence in error. So it came to pass\nthat when Colonel Clumps (after the battle of Vittoria, in which he had\nshown conspicuous valour) was told of poor Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sad disgrace, he\nwas a great deal too clever and astute to believe a single word of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is ludicrous, perfectly ludicrous!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, that being the\nstrongest adjective he knew to express pure impossibility. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA gallant\nyoung fellow to be cashiered without even a court-martial! How dare you\ntell me such a thing, sir? I am not a man to be rough-ridden. Nobody\never has imposed on me. And the boy is almost a sort of cousin of my\nown. The first family in the kingdom, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe colonel flew into so great a rage, twisting his white hair, and\nstamping his lame heel, that the officer who had brought the news,\nbeing one of his own subalterns, wisely retired into doubts about it,\nand hinted that nobody knew the reason, and therefore that it could not\nbe true.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I mention that absurd report about young Lorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought\nColonel Clumps, when writing to Lady de Lampnor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI may do harm, and\nI can do no good, but only get myself laughed at as the victim of a\nstupid hoax. So I will say no more about him, except that I have not\nseen him lately, being so far from head-quarters, and knowing how Old\nBeaky is driving the staff about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And before the brave Colonel found\nopportunity of taking the pen in hand again, he was heavily wounded in\na skirmish with the French rear-guard, and ordered home, as hereafter\nwill appear.\n\nIt also happened that Mr. Capper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends, those two officers who had\nearned so little of Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gratitude by news of Hilary, were harassed\nand knocked about too much to find any time for writing letters. And\nas the _Gazette_ in those days neglected the smaller concerns of the\narmy, and became so hurried by the march of events, and the rapid\nsequence of battles, that the doings of junior officers slipped through\nits fingers until long afterwards, the result was that neither Coombe\nLorraine nor Old Applewood farm received for months any news of the\nyoung staff officer. Neither did he yet present himself at either of\nthose homesteads. For, as the ancient saying runs, misfortunes never\ncome alone. The ship in which Hilary sailed for England from the port\nof Cadiz--for he found no transport at Malaga--_The Flower of Kent_, as\nshe was called, which appeared to him an excellent omen, was nipped in\nthe bud of her homeward voyage. She met with a nasty French privateer\nto the southward of Cape Finisterre. In vain she crowded sail, and\ntried every known resource of seamanship; the Frenchman had the heels\nof her, and laid her on board at sundown. Lorraine, and two or three\nold soldiers, battered and going to hospital, had no idea of striking,\nexcept in the British way of doing it. But the master and mate knew\nbetter, and stopped the hopeless conflict. So the Frenchman sacked\nand scuttled the ship in the most scientific manner, and, wanting no\nprisoners, landed the crew on a desolate strand of Gallicia, without\nany money to save them.\n\nThis being their condition, it is the proper thing to leave them\nso; for nothing is more unwise than to ask, or rather to \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitute\ninquiries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as to the doings of people who are much too likely to\nrequire a loan; therefore return we to the South Down hills.\n\nThe wet, ungenial, and stormy summer of 1813 was passing into a wetter,\nmore cheerless, and most tempestuous autumn. On the northern slopes of\nthe light-earthed hills the moss had come over the herbage, and the\nsweet nibble of the sheep was souring. The huddled trees (which here\nand there rise just to the level of the ridge, and then seem polled by\nthe sweep of the wind-rush), the bushes also, and the gorse itself,\nstood, or rather stooped, beneath the burden of perpetual wet. The\nleaves hung down in a heavy drizzle, unable to detach themselves from\nthe welting of the unripe stalks; the husk of the beech and the key\nof the ash were shrivelled for want of kernels, and the clusters of\nthe hazel-nut had no sun-varnish on them. The weakness of the summer\nsun (whether his face was spotted overmuch, or too immaculate), and\nthe humour of clouds, and the tenor of winds, and even the tendency\nof the earth itself to devolve into eccentricity,--these and a\nhundred other causes for the present state of the weather were found,\naccording to where they were looked for. On one point only there was no\ncontradiction,--things were not as they ought to be.\n\nEven the Rector of West Lorraine, a man of most cheerful mind and not\nto be put down by any one, laying to the will of the Lord his failures,\nand to his own merits all good success,--even the Rev. Struan Hales\nwas scarcely a match for the weather. Sportsmen in those days did\nnot walk in sevenfold armour, for fear of a thorn, or a shower, or a\ncow-dab; nor skulked they two or three hours in a rick, awaiting the\njoy of one butchering minute. Fair play for man, and dog, and gun, and\nfur and feather, was then the rule; and a day of sport meant a day of\nwork, and healthful change, and fine exercise. Therefore, Mr. Hales\nwent forth with his long and heavily-loaded gun, to comfort himself\nand refresh his mind, whatever the weather might be about, upon six\ndays out of every seven. The hounds had not begun to meet; the rivers\nwere all in flood, of course; the air was so full of rheumatism that\nno man could crook his arm to write a sermon, or work a concordance.\nTwo sick old women had taken a fancy for pheasant boiled with\nartichoke;--willy-nilly, the parson found it a momentous duty now to\nshoot.\n\nAnd who went with him? There is no such thing as consistency of the\nhuman mind; yet well as this glorious truth was known, and bemoaned\nby every one for his neighbour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake--not they, not all the parish,\nnor even we of the enlarged philosophy, could or can ever be brought\nto believe our own eyes that it was Bonny! But, in spite of all\nimpossibility, it was; and the explanation requires relapse.\n\nIs it within recollection that the Rector once shot a boy in a hedge?\nThe boy had clomb up into an ivied stump, for purposes of his own,\ncombining espial with criticism. All critics deserve to be shot, if\nthey dare to cross the grand aims of true enterprise. They pepper, and\nare peppered; but they generally get the best of it. And so did this\nboy that was shot in the hedge. Being of a crafty order, he dropped,\nand howled and rolled so piteously, that poor Mr. Hales, although\nhe had fired at a distance of more than fourscore yards from the\nlatent vagabond, cast down his gun in the horror of having slain a\nfellow-creature. But when he ran up, and turned him over to search for\nthe fatal injury, the boy so vigorously kicked and roared, that the\nparson had great hopes of him. After some more rolling, a balance was\nstruck; the boy had some blue spots under his skin, and a broad gold\nguinea to plaster them.\n\nNow this boy was not our Bonny, nor fit in any way to compare with him.\nBut uncivilized minds are very jealous; and next to our Bonny, this boy\nthat was shot was the furthest from civilization of all the boys of\nthe neighbourhood. Therefore, of course, bitter jealousy raged betwixt\nhim and the real outsider. Now the boy that was shot got a new pair of\nboots from the balance of his guinea, and a new pair of legs to his\nnether garments, under his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guidance. And to show what he was,\nand remove all doubts of the genuine expenditure, his father and mother\ncombined and pricked him, with a pin in a stick, to the Sunday-school.\nHere Madge Hales (the second and strongest daughter of the church) laid\nhold of him, and converted him into right views of theology, hanging\nupon sound pot-hooks.\n\nBut a far greater mind than Bill Harkles could own was watching this\nnoble experiment. Bonny had always hankered kindly after a knowledge\nof \u00e2\u0080\u009cpictur-books.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The gifts of nature were hatching inside him, and\nchipped at the shell of his chickenhood. He had thrashed Bill Harkles\nin two fair fights, without any aid from his donkey, and he felt that\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind had no right whatever to be brought up to look down on him.\n\nThis boy, therefore, being sneered at by erudite Bill Harkles, knew\nthat his fists would be no fair answer, and retired to his cave. Here\nhe looked over his many pickings, and proudly confessing inferior\nlearning, refreshed himself with superior wealth. And this meditation,\nhaving sound foundation, satisfied him till the next market-day--the\nmarket-day at Steyning. Bonny had not much business here, but he\nalways liked to look at things; and sometimes he got a good pannier of\nvictuals, and sometimes he got nothing. For the farmers of the better\nsort put off their dinner till two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, when the prime of the\nmarket was over, and then sat down to boiled beef and carrots in the\nyard of the White Horse Inn, and often did their best in that way.\n\nOf this great \u00e2\u0080\u009cordinary\u00e2\u0080\u009d--great at any rate as regards\nconsumption--Farmer Gates, the churchwarden, was by ancestral right\nthe chairman; but for several market-days the vice-presidency had been\nvacant. A hot competition had raged, and all Steyning had thrilled with\nhigh commotion about the succession to the knife and fork at the bottom\nof the table; until it was announced amid general applause that Bottler\nwas elected. It was a proud day for this good pigman, and perhaps a\nstill prouder one for Bonny, when the new vice-president was inducted\ninto the Windsor chair at the foot of the long and ancient table; and\nit marked the turning-point in the life of more than one then present.\n\nThe vice-president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cart was in the shed close by, and on the front\nlade sat Bonny, sniffing the beauty of the \u00e2\u0080\u009csilver-side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the\nluscious suggestions of the marrow-bone. Polly longed fiercely to be\nup there with him; but her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stern sense of decorum forbade;\nthe pretty Miss Bottlers would be toasted after dinner,--and was one\nto be spied in a pig-cart? No sooner was the cloth removed, than the\nchairman proposed, in most feeling and eloquent language, the health of\nhis new colleague. And now it was Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reply which created a grand\nrevolution in Steyning. With graceful modesty he ascribed his present\nproud position, the realization of his fondest hopes, neither to his\nwell-known integrity, industry, strict attention to business, nor even\nthe quality of his bacon. All these things, of course, contributed;\nbut \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat was the grand element of his unparalleled success in life?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nA cry of \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhite stockings!\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the Bramber pig-sticker was sternly\nsuppressed, and the man kicked out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe grand element of his success\nin life was his classical education!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNobody knowing what was meant by this, thunders of applause ensued;\nuntil it was whispered from cup to cup that Bottler, when he was six\nyears old, had been three months at the Grammar School. He might have\nforgotten every word he had learned, but any one might see that it\nwas dung dug in. So a dozen of the farmers resolved at once to have\ntheir children Latined; and Bonny in his inmost heart aspired to some\neducation. What was the first step to golden knowledge? He put this\nquestion to himself obscurely, as he rode home on his faithful Jack,\nwith all the marrow-bones of the great feast rattling in a bag behind\nhim. From the case of Bill Harkles he reasoned soundly, that the first\nthing to do was to go and get shot.\n\nOn the following day--the month being August, or something very near\nit, in the year 1812 (a year behind the time we got on to)--Mr. Hales,\nto keep his hand in, took his favourite flint-gun down, and patted\nit, and reprimed it. He had finished his dinner, it had been a good\none; and his partner in life had been lamenting the terrible price of\nbutcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meat. She did not see how it could end in anything short\nof a wicked rebellion, when the price of bread was put with it. And\nthe Rector had answered, with a wink to Cecil, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOrder no meat for\nto-morrow, my dear, nor even for the next day. We shall see what we\nshall see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With this power of promise, he got on his legs, and stopped\nall who were fain to come after him. He knew every coney and coney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhole on the glebe, and on the clerk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land; and they all would now be\nout at grass, and must be treated gingerly. He was going to shoot for\nthe pot, as sportsmen generally did in those days.\n\nWith visions of milky onions, about to be poured on a broad and\nwell-boiled back, the Rector (after sneaking through a furzy gate)\npeeped down a brown trench of the steep hill-side; here he spied\nthree little sandy juts of Recent excavation, and on each of them sat\na hunch-backed coney, proud of the labours of the day, and happily\ncurling his whiskers. The Rector, peering downward, saw the bulging\nover their large black eyes, and the prick of their delicate ears,\nand their gentle chewing of the grass-blade. There was no chance of a\nrunning shot, for they would pop into earth in a moment; so he tried\nto get two of them into a line, and then he pulled his trigger. The\nnearest rabbit fell dead as a stone; but the Rector could scarcely\nbelieve his eyes, when through the curls of the smoke he beheld,\ninstead of the other rabbit, a ragged boy rolling, and kicking, and\nholloaing!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I never to shoot without shooting a boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the parson, rushing\nforward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother guinea! A likely thing! I vow I will only pay a\nshilling this time. The sport would ruin a bishop!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Mr. Hales found to his great delight that the boy was not touched\nby a shot, nor even made pretence to be so. He had craftily crept\nthrough the bushes from below, and quietly lurked near the rabbit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhole, and after the shot, had darted forth, and thrown himself cleverly\non the wounded rabbit, who otherwise must have got away to die a\nlingering death in his burrow. The quickness and skill of the boy,\nand the luck of thus bagging both rabbits, so pleased the Rector that\nhe gave him sixpence, and bade him follow, to carry the game and to\nsee more sport. Bonny had a natural turn for sport, which never could\nbe beaten out of him, and to get it encouraged by the rector of the\nparish was indeed a godsend. And in his excitement at every shot, he\npoured forth his heart about rabbits, and hares, and wood-queests, and\npartridges, and even pheasants.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you know more than I do!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector, kindly laying his hand\non the shoulder of the boy, after loading for his tenth successful\nshot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow ever have you picked up all these things? The very worst\npoacher of the coming age; or else the best gamekeeper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI looks about, or we does, me and Jack together,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Bonny, with\none of his broadest and most genuine grins; and the gleam of his teeth,\nand the twinkle of his eyes, enforced the explanation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome to my house in the morning, Bonny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector. And that was\nthe making of him. For the boy that cleaned the knives and boots had\nnever conscientiously filled that sphere, though he was captain of the\nBible-class. And now he had taken the measles so long, that they had\nput him to earth the celery. Here was an opening, and Bonny seized it;\nand though he made very queer work at first, his native ability carried\nhim on, till he put a fine polish on everything. From eighteenpence a\nweek he rose to two and threepence, within nine months; and to this he\nsoon added the empty bottles, and a commission upon the grease-pot!\n\nEven now, all has not been told; for by bringing the cook good news\nof her sweetheart, and the parlourmaid dry sticks to light her fire,\nand by showing a tender interest in the chilblains of even the\nscullerymaid, he became such a favourite in the kitchen, that the\ncaptain of the Bible-class defied him to a battle in the wash-house.\nThe battle was fought, and victory, though long doubtful, perched at\nlast upon the banner of brave Bonny; and with mutual esteem, and four\nblack eyes, the heroes parted.\n\nAfter this all ran smooth. The Rector (who had enjoyed the conflict\nfrom his study-window, without looking off, more than he could help,\nfrom a sermon upon \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeek peace, and ensue it\u00e2\u0080\u009d), as soon as he had\nsatisfied himself which of the two boys hit the straighter, went to\nan ancient wardrobe, and examined his bygone hunting clothes. Here he\nfound an old scarlet coat, made for him thirty years ago at Oxford, but\nnow a world too small; and he sighed that he had no son to inherit it.\nAlso a pair of old buckskin breeches, fitter for his arms than his legs\njust now. The moths were in both; they were growing scurfy; sentiment\nmust give way to sense. So Bonny got coat and breeches; and the maids\nwith merry pinches, and screams of laughter, and consolatory kisses,\nadapted them. He showed all his grandeur to his donkey Jack, and Jack\nwas in two minds about snapping at it.\n\nThis matter being cleared, and the time brought up, here we are at West\nLorraine in earnest, in the month of October, 1813; long after Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nshocking disgrace, but before any of his own people knew it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nTHE WOEBURN.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a lazy loon that Steenie Chapman is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector, for about\nthe twentieth time, one fine October morning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe knows what dreadful\nweather we get now, and yet he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be here by nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock! Too bad,\nI call it; too bad a great deal. Send away the teapot, Caroline.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mrs. Hales, who always made the best of every\none, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou forget how very bad the roads must be, after all the rain we\nhave had. And I am sure he will want a cup of tea after riding through\nsuch flooded roads.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTea, indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the parson muttered, as he strode in and out of the\nroom, with his shot-belt dancing on his velveteen shooting-coat, and\nsnapped his powder-flask impatiently; \u00e2\u0080\u009cSteenie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tea comes from the\ncase, not the caddy. And the first gleam of sunshine I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen for a\nweek, after that heavy gale last night. It will rain before twelve\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, for a guinea. Cecil, run and see if you can find that boy\nBonny. I shall start by myself, and send Bonny down the road with a\nmessage for Captain Chapman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe huntsman came out of the back-kitchen, Cecil, about two minutes\nago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Madge, who never missed a chance of a cut at Bonny, because\nhe had thrashed her pet Bible-scholar; \u00e2\u0080\u009che was routing about, with his\nred coat on, for scraps of yellow soap and candle-ends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a story!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Cecil, who was Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s champion, being his\nschoolmistress; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish your Dick was half as good a boy. He gets\nhonester every day almost. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll send him to you, papa, in two seconds.\nI suppose you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll speak to him at the side-door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt a nod from her father, away she ran, while Madge followed slowly to\nhelp in the search; and finding that the boy had left the house, they\ntook different paths in the garden to seek him, or overtake him on his\nhomeward way. In a few moments Cecil, as she passed some laurels, held\nup her hand to recall her sister, and crossed the grass towards her\nvery softly, with finger on lip and a mysterious look.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush! and come here very quietly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you\nsomething as good as a play.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then the two girls peeped through the\nlaurel-bush, and watched with great interest what was going on.\n\nIn an alley of the kitchen-garden sat Bonny upon an old sea-kale pot,\nclad in his red coat and white breeches, and deeply meditating. Before\nhim, upon an espalier tree, hung a tempting and beautiful apple, a\nscarlet pearmain, with its sleek sides glistening in the slant of the\nsunbeams.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lay you a shilling he steals it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madge whispered into the ear\nof her sister. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Cecil, with her hand before her mouth.\nMeanwhile Bonny was giving them the benefit of his train of reasoning.\nHis mouth was wide open, and his eyes very bright, and his forehead a\nfield of perplexity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all agrubbing in the house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he reflected; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand they ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been\nand offered me a bit to-day. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever so many more on the tree; and\nthey locked up the scullery cupboard; and one on \u00e2\u0080\u0099em called me a little\nwarmint; and they tuck the key out of the beertap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith all these wrongs upward, he stretched forth his hand, and pretty\nCecil trembled for her shilling, shillings being very scarce with her.\nBut the boy, without quite having touched the apple, drew back his\nhand; and that withdrawal perhaps was the turning-point of his life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe gived me all this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, looking at his sleeve; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand all on \u00e2\u0080\u0099em\nstitched it up for me; and they lets me go in and out without watching;\nand twice I\u00e2\u0080\u0099se been out with him, shutting! I \u00e2\u0080\u0099ont, I \u00e2\u0080\u0099ont. And them\ncoorse red apples seldom be worth ating of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSturdily he arose, and gave a kick at one of the posts of the\napple-tree, and set off for the gate as hard as he could go, while the\nvirtuous vein should be uppermost.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a darling of honour!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Cecil Hales, jumping after him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA\nBayard, a Cato, an Aristides! He shall have his apple, and he shall\nhave sixpence; and unlimited faith for ever. Bonny! come back. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nyour apple for you, and sixpence; and what would you like to have best\nin all the world now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo go out shutting with the master, miss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall do it; I will speak to papa myself. If you please, Miss\nMadge, pay up your shilling. Now come back, Bonny; your master wants\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a little too late for your errand, I fear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Margaret,\npulling her purse out; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhile you were pursuing this boy, I heard the\nsound of a grand arrival.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo much the better!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Cecil, who (like her mother) always made\nthe best of things. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa has been teasing his gun for an hour. Bonny,\nrun back, and keep old Shot quiet. He will break his chain, by the\nnoise he makes. You are as bad as he is; and you both shall go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Rector--of all men the most hospitable, though himself so sober\nin the morning--revived Captain Chapman, or at least refreshed him,\nwith brandy and bitters, after that long ride. And keenly heeding all\nhindrance, in his own hurry to be starting, he thought it a very bad\nsign for poor Alice, that Stephen received no comfort from one, nor\ntwo, nor even three, large glasses.\n\nAt length they set forth, with a sickly sun shrinking back from the\npromise of the morning, and a vaporous glisten in the white south-east,\nlooking as watery as the sea. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you so, Steenie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nparson, who knew every sign of the weather among these hills; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe ought\nto have started two hours sooner. If ever we had wet jackets in our\nlife, we shall have them to-day, bold captain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will bring in the snipes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain, bravely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not\nthe sort of men, I take it, to heed a little sprinkle. Tom, have you\ngot my bladder-coat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, your honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his keeper replied: and \u00e2\u0080\u009cSee-ho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nBonny, while the dogs were ranging.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere, where, where?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the captain, dancing in a breathless\nflurry round a tuft of heath. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see him; where is he, boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoke her up, boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector; \u00e2\u0080\u009csurely you would not shoot the\npoor thing on her form!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet him sit till I see him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the captain, cocking both his\nbarrels; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow I am ready. Where the devil is he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Bonny, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause your honour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heel be on\nher whiskers. Ah, there her gooth! Quick, your honour!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd go she did in spite of his honour, and both the loads he sent\nafter her; while the Rector laughed so at the captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plight, that\nit was quite impossible for him to shoot. The keeper also put on an\nexperienced grin, while Bonny flung open all the cavern of his mouth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRun after him, boy! Look alive!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the captain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI defy him to go\nmore than fifty yards. You must all have seen how I peppered him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, and salted her too, I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the parson: \u00e2\u0080\u009clook along the\nbarrel of my gun, and you will see the salt still on her tail, Steenie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he pointed they all saw the gallant hare at a leisurely canter\ncrossing the valley, some quarter of a mile below them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid you see that jump? What can there be to\njump over there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d For puss had made a long bound from bank to bank, at\na place where they could not see the bottom.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWater, if \u00e2\u0080\u0099e plaize, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Bonny; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca girt strame of water\ncomed down that hollow, all of a sudden this mornint; and it hath been\ngrowing stronger ever since.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Mr. Hales, dropping his gun. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the water\nlike, boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never seed no water like it afore. As black as what I does your\nboots with, sir; but as clear--you can see every stone in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen the Lord have mercy on this poor parish; and especially to the\nold house of Lorraine! For the Woeburn has broken out again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Rector, you seem in a very great fright,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Captain Chapman,\nrecovering slowly from his sad discomfiture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter about\nthis water? Some absurd old superstition--is not it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuperstition or not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Hales answered shortly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must leave you\nto shoot by yourself, Captain Chapman. I could not fire another shot\nto-day. It is more than three hundred and fifty years since this water\nof death was seen. In my church you may read what happened then. And\nnot only that, but according to tradition its course runs directly\nthrough our village, and even through my garden. My people know nothing\nabout it yet. It may burst upon them quite suddenly. There are many\nobstructions, no doubt, in its course, and many hollow places to fill\nup. But before many hours it will reach us. As a question of prudence,\nI must hasten home. Shot, come to heel this moment!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall do the same. Your\nhospitable board will excuse me to-night. I would much rather not leap\nthe Woeburn in the dark.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith the instinct of a man of the world, he perceived that the Rector,\nunder this depression, would prefer to have no guest. Moreover, the\nclouds were gathering with dark menace over the hill-tops; and he was\nnot the man--if such man there be--to find pleasure in a wet day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nshooting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo horse has ever yet crossed the Woeburn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Hales replied, as they\nall turned homeward across the shoulder of the hill; \u00e2\u0080\u009cat least, if the\nlegends about that are true. Though a hare may have leaped it to-day,\nto-morrow no horse will either swim or leap it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBless my heart! does it rise like that? The sooner we get out of its\nway the better. What a pest it will be to you, Rector! Why, you never\nwill be able to come to the meet, and our opening day is next Tuesday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSteenie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector, imbibing hope, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit has not struck me in\nthat light before. But it scarcely could ever be the will of the Lord\nto cut off a parson from his own pack!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t walk so fast!\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted Captain Chapman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck might\nbe broken down a hill like this. Tom, let me lean on your shoulder.\nBoy, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you sixpence to carry my gun. Tom take the flints out,\nthat he mayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shoot me. Here, Uncle Struan, just sit down a minute; a\nminute can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any difference, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector, who was also out of breath. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBonny,\nhow far was the black water come? You seem to know all about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlaize, sir, it seem to be coming down a hill; and the longer I\nlooked, the more water was a-coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou little nincompoop! had it passed your own door yet--your hole, or\nyour cave, or whatever you call it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlaize, sir, it worn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a runnin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 towards I at all. It wor makin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a\nhole in the ground and kickin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a splash up in a fuzzy corner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy poor boy, its course is not far from your door; it may be in among\nyour goods, and have drowned your jackass and all, by this time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLike an arrow from a bow, away went Bonny down the headlong hill,\nhaving cast down the captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gun, and pulled off his red coat to run\nthe faster. The three men left behind clapped their hands to their\nsides and roared with laughter; at such a pace went the white buckskin\nbreeches, through bramble, gorse, heather, over rock, sod, and chalk.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a grand flying shot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the keeper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere the treasure is, there will the heart be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector as\nsoon as he could speak. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would give a month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tithes for a good day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nrout among that boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accumulations. He has got the most wonderful\nthings, they say; and he keeps them on shelves, like a temple of idols.\nWhat will he do when he gets too big to go in at his own doorway? I am\nfeeding him up with a view to that; and so are my three daughters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe must be a thorough young thief,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn any other\nparish he would be in prison. I scarcely know which is the softer\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098beak\u00e2\u0080\u0099--as we are called--you, or Sir Roland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector, \u00e2\u0080\u009crun on before us; you are young and active.\nInquire where old Nanny Stilgoe lives, at the head of the village, and\ntell her that the flood is coming upon her; and help her to move her\nthings, poor old soul, if she will let you help her. Tell her I sent\nyou, and perhaps she will, although she is very hard to deal with. She\nhas long been foretelling this break of the bourne; but the prophets\nare always the last to set their own affairs in order.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe keeper touched his hat, and set off. He always attended to the\nparson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders more than his own master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. And Mr. Hales saw from the\ncaptain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face that he had ordered things too freely.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSteenie, I beg your pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI forgot for the moment that I\nshould have asked you before I despatched your man like that. But I did\nit for your own good, because we need no longer hurry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRector, I am infinitely obleeged to you. To order those men is so\nfatiguing. I always want some one to do it for me. And now we may go\ndown the hill, I suppose, without snapping all our knee-caps. To go up\na hill fast is a very bad thing; but to go down fast is a great deal\nworse, because you think you can do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear fellow, you may take your time. I will not walk you off your\nlegs, as that wicked niece of mine did. How are you getting on there\nnow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that is a delicate question, Rector. You know what ladies\nare, you know. But I do not see any reason to despair of calling you\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098uncle,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in earnest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you brought the old lady over to your side? You are sure to be\nright when that is done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has been on my side all along, for the sake of the land. Ah, how\ngood it is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd nobody else in the field, that we know of. Then Lallie can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold\nout so very much longer. Lord bless me! do you see that black line\nyonder?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure! Why, it seems to be moving onward, like a great snake\ncrawling. And it has a white head. What a wonderful thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is our first view of the Woeburn. Would to heaven that it were our\nlast one! The black is the water, and the white, I suppose, is the\nchalky scum swept before it. It is following the old track, as lava\ndoes. It will cross the Coombe road in about five minutes. If you want\nto get home, you must be quick to horse. Never mind the rain: let us\nrun down the hill--or just stop one half-minute.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey were sitting in the shelter of a chalky rock, with the sullen\nstorm rising from the south behind them, and the drops already\npattering. On the right hand and on the left, brown ridges, furzy\nrises, and heathery scollops overhanging slidden rubble, and the\nsteep zigzags of the sheep, and the rounding away into nothing of\nthe hill-tops,--all of these were fading into the slaty blue of the\nrain-cloud. Before them spread for leagues and leagues, clear and soft,\nand smiling still, the autumnal beauty of the wealdland. Tufting\nhamlets here and there, with darker foliage round them, elbows of some\ndistant lane unconsciously prominent, swathes of colour laid on broadly\nwhere the crops were all alike; some bold tree of many ages standing on\nits right to stand; and grey church-towers, far asunder, landmarks of a\nlonger view; in the fading distance many things we cannot yet make out;\nbut hope them to be good and beauteous, calm, and large with human life.\n\nThis noble view expanded always the great heart of the Rector; and he\nnever failed to point out clearly the boundary-line of his parish. He\ncould scarcely make up his mind to miss that opportunity, even now; and\nwas just beginning with a distant furze-rick, far to the westward under\nChancton Ring, when Chapman, having heard it at least seven times, cut\nhim short rather briskly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are forgetting one thing, my dear sir. Your parish is being cut in\ntwo, while you are dwelling on the boundaries.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSteenie, you are right. I had no idea that you had so much sense,\nmy boy. You see how the ditches stand all full of water, so as to\nconfuse me. A guinea for the first at the rectory gate! You ought to be\nhandicapped. You call yourself twenty years younger, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the guinea!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Chapman, as the parson set off; \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo if you\nlike; only let me come down this confounded hill considerately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Hales found nothing yet amiss with his own premises; some people\nhad come to borrow shovels, and wheeling-planks, and such like; but the\ngarden looked so fair and dry, with its pleasant slope to the east,\nthat the master laughed at his own terrors; until he looked into the\ncovered well, the never-failing black-diamond water, down below the\ntool-house. Here a great cone rose in the middle of the well, like a\nplume of black ostrich; and the place was alive with hollow noises.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDig the celery!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery man and boy, come here. I\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have my celery washed away, nor my drumhead savoys, nor my ragged\nJack. Girls, come out, every one of you. There is not a moment to\nlose, I tell you. I never had finer stuff in all my life; and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhave it washed away, I tell you. Here, you heavy-breeched Dick! what\nthe dickens are you gaping at? I shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a thing done before dark,\nat this rate. Out of my way, every one of you. If ye can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stir you\nstumps, I can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith less avail, like consternation seized every family in West\nLorraine. A river, of miraculous birth and power, was sweeping down\nupon all of them. There would never be any dry land any more; all the\nwise old women had said so. Everybody expected to see black water\nbubbling up under his bed that night.\n\nMeanwhile this beautiful and grand issue of the gathered hill-springs\nmoved on its way majestically, obeying the laws it was born of. The\ngale of the previous night had unsealed the chamber of great waters,\nforcing the needful air into the duct, and opening vaults that stored\nthe rainfall of a hundred hills and vales. Through such a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbower of\nstalactite, such limpid realms and lakes enlock\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in caves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cyrene led\nher weeping son--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere all the rivers of the world he found,\n    In separate channels gliding underground.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd now, as this cold resistless flood calmly reclaimed its ancient\nchannel, swallowed up Nanny Stilgoe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well, and cut off the Rector from\nhis own church; as if to encounter its legendary bane, a poor young\nfellow, depressed, and shattered, feeble, and wan, and heavy-hearted,\nwas dragging his reluctant steps up the valley of the Adur. Left on\nthe naked rocks of Spain, conquered, plundered, and half-starved,\nHilary Lorraine had fallen, with the usual reaction of a sanguine\ntemperament, into low spirits and disordered health. So that when he\nat last made his way to Corunna, and found no British agent there, nor\nany one to draw supplies from, nothing but the pride of his family\nkept him from writing to the Count of Zamora. Of writing to England\nthere was no chance. All communication ran through the channels of the\ndistant and victorious army. So that he thought himself very lucky (in\nthe present state of his health and fortunes), when the captain of\nan oil-ship bound for London, having lost three hands on the outward\nvoyage, allowed him to work his passage. The fare of a landsman in\nfeeble health was worth perhaps more than his services; but the captain\nwas a kind-hearted man, and perceived (though he knew not who Hilary\nwas) that he had that very common thing in those days, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgent under\na cloud\u00e2\u0080\u009d to deal with. And the gale, which had opened the Woeburn,\nshortened Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track towards it, by forcing his ship to run for\nrefuge into Shoreham harbour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow shall I go home? What shall I say? Disgraced, degraded, and broken\ndown, a stain upon my name and race, I am not fit to enter our old\ndoors. What will my father say to me? And proud Alice--what will her\nthoughts be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith steps growing slower at each weary drag, he crossed the bridge\nof Bramber, and passed beneath the ivied towers of the rivals of his\nancestors, and then avoiding Steyning town, he turned up the valley of\nWest Lorraine. And the rain which had come on at middle-day, and soaked\nhis sailor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slops long ago, now took him on the flank judiciously. And\nhis heart was so low, that he received it all without talking either to\nhimself or it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go to the rectory first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought; \u00e2\u0080\u009cUncle Struan is violent,\nbut he is warm. And though he has three children of his own, he loves\nme much more than my father does.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith this resolution, he turned on the right down a lane that came\nout by the rectory. The lane broke out suddenly into black water; and\na tall robust man stood in the twilight, with a heavy spade over his\nshoulder. And Hilary Lorraine went up to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, my man; not a penny to spare!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector in\nanticipation; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have a great deal too much to do with our own poor,\nand with this new trouble especially. The times are hard--yes, they\nalways are; I never knew them otherwise. But an honest man always can\nget good work. Or go and fight for your country, like a man. But we\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any vagrants in my parish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have fought for my country like a man, Uncle Struan; and this is all\nthat has come of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood God, Hilary!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector; and for a long time he found\nnothing better to say.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Uncle Struan, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you understand? Every one must have his ups\nand downs. I am having a long spell of downs just now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear boy, my dear boy! Whatever have you done?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean to throw me over, Uncle Struan, as the rest of the world\nhas beautifully done! Everything seems to be upset. What is the meaning\nof this broad, black stream?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome into my study, and tell me all. I can let you in without sight of\nyour aunt. The shock would be too great for her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary followed, without a word. Mr. Hales led him in at the window,\nand warmed him, and covered him with his own dressing-gown, and watched\nhim slowly recovering.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind the tar on your hands; it is an honest smell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy\npoor boy, my poor boy, what you must have been through!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever has happened to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Hilary, spreading his thin\nhands to the fire, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas been all of my own doing, Uncle Struan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall have a cordial, and you shall tell me all. There, I have\nbolted the door. I am your parson as well as your uncle. All you say\nwill be sacred with me. And I am sure you have done no great harm after\nall. We shall see what your dear aunt thinks of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Hilary, sipping a little rum-and-water, wandered through his\nstory; not telling it brightly, as once he might have done, but hiding\nnothing consciously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean to tell me there is nothing worse than that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the\nRector, with a sigh of great relief.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing worse, uncle. How could it be worse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they turned you out of the army for that! How thankful I am for\nbelonging to the Church! You are simply a martyred hero.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, they turned me out of the army for that. How could they help it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nReasoning thus, he met his uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look of pity, and it was too much\nfor him. He did what many a far greater man, and braver hero has done,\nand will do, when the soul is moving. He burst into a hot flood of\ntears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nGOING DOWN THE HILL.\n\n\nSir Roland Lorraine was almost as free from superstition as need be. To\nbe wholly quit of that romantic element is a disadvantage still; and\nexcepts a neighbour even now from the general neighbourly sympathy.\nThreescore years ago, of course, that prejudice was threefold.\n\nThe swing of British judgment mainly takes magnetic repulse from\nwhatever the French are rushing after. When they are Republican, all of\nus rally for throne and Constitution. When they have a Parliament, we\nwant none. When they are pressed under empire, we are apt to be glad\nthat it serves them right. We know them to be brave and good, lovers of\nhonour, and sensitive; but we cannot get over the line between us and\nthem--and the rest of the world, perhaps.\n\nWhatever might be said or reasoned, for or against the whole of\nsuch things, Sir Roland had long made up his mind to be moderate\nand neutral. He liked everybody to speak his best (according to\nself-opinion), and he liked to keep out of the way of them all, and\nrelapse into the wiser ages. He claimed his own power to think for\nhimself, as well as the mere right of doing so. And therefore he long\nhad been \u00e2\u0080\u009cheterodox\u00e2\u0080\u009d to earnest, right-minded people.\n\nNever the more, however, could he shake himself free from the inborn\nmight of hereditary impress. The traditions of his house and race had\nstill some power over him, a power increased by long seclusion, and the\nlove of hearth and home. Therefore, when Trotman was cut off, on his\nway for his weekly paper, by a great black gliding flood, and aghast\nran up the Coombe to tell it--Sir Roland, while he smiled, felt strange\nmisgivings creeping coldly.\n\nAlice, a sweet and noble maiden, on the tender verge of womanhood, came\nto her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, and led him back to his favourite book-room. She\nsaw that he was at the point of trembling; although he could still\ncommand his nerves, unless he began to think of them. Dissembling her\nsense of all this, she sat by the fire, and waited for him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy darling, we have had a very happy time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began at last to say to\nher; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou and I, for many years, suiting one another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure we have, father. And I mean to go on suiting you, for many\nmore years yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer father saw by the firelight the sadness in her eyes; and he put\nsome gaiety into his own, or tried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLallie, you have brighter things before you--a house of your own, and\nsociety, and the grand world, and great shining.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExcellent things, no doubt, my father; but not to be compared with you\nand home. Have I done anything to vex you that you talk like this to\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me see. Come here and show me. There are few things I enjoy so\nmuch as being vexed by you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, papa, you are in a hurry to have your usual laugh at me. You\nshall have no material now. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I knows what is right, and I means to do\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099--as the man said to me at the turnpike-gate, when he made me pay\ntwice over. Consider yourself, my darling father, saddled for all your\nlife with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland loved his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quick bright turns of love, and filial\npassion when her heart was really moved. A thousand complex moods and\nlongings played around or pierced her then; yet all controlled, or\nat least concealed, by an English lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quietude. Alice was so like\nhimself, that he always knew what she would think; and he tried his\nbest to follow the zigzag flash of feminine feeling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last: \u00e2\u0080\u009csomething has been too much for you.\nPerhaps that foolish fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story of this mysterious water. A gross\nexaggeration, doubtless. The finny tribe fast sticking by the gills in\nthe nest of the wood-pigeon. Marry come up! Let us see these wonders.\nThe moon is at the full to-night; and I hear no rain on the windows\nnow. Go and fetch my crabstick, darling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, may I come with you, papa? Do say yes. I shall lie awake all\nnight, unless I go. The moon is sure to clear the storm off; and I will\nwrap up so thoroughly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you cannot wrap up your feet, dear child; and the roads are\ncontinually flooded now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot on the chalk, papa; never on the chalk, except in the very hollow\nplaces. Besides, I will put on my new French clogs. They can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be much\nless than six inches thick. I shall stand among the deluge high enough\nfor the fish to build their nests on me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDaughter of folly, and no child of mine, go and put your clogs on. We\nwill go out at the eastern door, to arouse no curiosity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs the master and his daughter passed beneath the astrologer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tower,\nand left the house by his private entrance, they could not help\nthinking of the good old prince, and his kind anxiety about them. To\nthe best of their knowledge, the wise Agasicles had never heard of the\nWoeburn; or perhaps his mind had been so much engrossed with the comet\nthat he took no heed of it. And even in his time, this strange river\nwas legendary as the Hydaspes.\n\nAfter the heavy and tempestuous rain, the night was fair, as it\ngenerally is, even in the worst of weather, when the full moon rises.\nThe long-chained hill, with its level outline stretching towards the\nsouth of east, afforded play for the glancing light of a watery and\nlaborious moon. Long shadows, laid in dusky bars, or cast in heavy\nmasses where the hollow land prevailed for them, and misty columns\nhovering and harbouring over tree-clumps, and gleams of quiet light\npursuing avenues of opening--all of these, at every step of deep\ndescent, appeared to flicker like a great flag waving.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a very lovely night! How beautifully the clouds lie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nAlice, being apt to kindle rashly into poetry: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey softly put\nthemselves in rows, and then they float towards the moon, and catch the\nsilver of her smile--oh, why do they do that, papa?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause the wind is west, my dear. Take care; you are on a great flint\nI fear. You are always cutting your boots out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, papa, no. I have got you this time. That shows how much you attend\nto me. I have got my great French clogs on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen how very unsafe to be looking at the moon! Lean on me steadily,\nif you must do that. The hill is slippery with slime on the chalk. You\nwill skate away to the bottom, and leave me mourning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, how I should love to skate, if ladies ever could do such a thing!\nI can slide very nicely, as you know, papa. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think, after all\nthis rain, we are sure to have a nice cold winter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho can tell, Lallie? I only hope not. You children, with your quick\ncirculation, active limbs, and vigorous lungs, are always longing for\nfrost and snow. But when they come, you get tired of them, within a\nweek at the utmost. But in your selfish spring of life you forget all\nthe miseries of the poor and old, or even young folk who are poor, and\nthe children starving everywhere. And the price of all food is now most\nalarming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure I meant no harm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cone cannot always think of\neverything. Papa, do you know that you have lately taken to be very\nhard on me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell now, everybody says that of me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered\nthoughtfully; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI scarcely dreamed that my fault was that. But out\nof many mouths I am convicted. Struan Hales says it; and so does my\nmother. Hilary seemed to imply it also, at the time when he last\nwas heard of. Mine own household, Trotman, Mrs. Pipkins, and that\ncharitable Mrs. Merryjack, have combined to take the same view of me.\nThere must be truth in it. I cannot make head against such a cloud of\nwitnesses. And now Alice joins them. What more do I want? I must revise\nmy opinion of myself, and confess that I am a hard-hearted man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis question Sir Roland debated with himself, in a manner which had\nlong been growing upon him, in the gathering love of solitude. Being\nby nature a man with a most extraordinary love of justice, he found\nit hard (as such rare men do) to be perfectly sure about anything. He\nalways desired to look at a subject from every imaginable outside view,\nreceding (like a lark in the clouds) from groundling consideration,\nyet frankly open (like a woodcock roasting) to anything good put under\nhim. Nobody knew him; but he did his best when he thought of that\nmatter, to know himself.\n\nNow, his daughter allowed him to follow out his meditation quietly; and\nthen she said as they went down the hill, warily heeding each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsteps--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, I beg you particularly to pay no attention whatever to your own\nopinion, or any other opinion in the world, except perhaps, at least,\nperhaps----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps that of Alice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite so, papa. About my own affairs my opinion is of no value: but\nabout yours, and the family in general, it is really--something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWisest of our race, and bravest, you are rushing into the water,\ndarling--stop; you have forgotten what we came for. We came to see the\nWoeburn, and here it is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this it? And yesterday I walked across this very place! Oh, what a\nstrange black river!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs Alice drew suddenly back and shuddered, Sir Roland Lorraine threw\nhis left arm round her, without a word, and looked at her. The light of\nthe full moon fell on her face, through a cleft of jagged margins, and\nthe shadow of a branch that had lost its leaves lay on her breast, and\ndarkened it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Lallie, you seem to be quite frightened,\u00e2\u0080\u009d her father said, after\nwaiting long; \u00e2\u0080\u009clook up at me, and tell me, dear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I am not at all frightened, papa, but perhaps I am a little out of\nspirits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Sir Roland; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou surely do not pay heed to old rhymes and\nsilly legends. I call this a fine and very lively water. I only wish it\nwere always here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, papa, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that, I implore you. And I felt you shiver when\nyou saw it first. You know what it means for our family,--loss of\nlife once, loss of property twice, and the third time the loss of\nhonour,--and with that, of course, our extinction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou little goose, none can lose their honour without dishonourable\nacts. Come, Miss Cassandra; of the present Lorraines--a very narrow\nresidue--who is to be distinguished thus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFather, you know so much more than I do; but I thought that many\npeople were disgraced, without having ever deserved it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDisgraced, my darling; but not dishonoured. What could disgrace\never be to us?--a thing that comes and goes according to the fickle\nseason--a result of the petty human weather, as this melancholy water\nis of the larger influence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, then you own that it is melancholy. That was just what I wanted\nyou to do. You always take things so differently from everybody else,\nthat I began to think you would look upon this as a happy outburst of a\ndesirable watering-water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell done, Lallie! The command of language is an admirable gift. But\nthe want of it leads to still finer issues. This watering-water seems\ninclined to go on for a long time watering.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, it must go flowing, flowing, until its time is over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLallie, you have, among many other gifts, a decided turn for epigram.\nYou scarcely could have described more tersely the tendencies of water.\nI firmly believe that this stream will go on flowing and flowing, until\nit quite stops.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, you are a great deal too bad. You must perceive that you are\nso even by the moonlight. I say the most sensible things ever thought\nof, and out of them you make nonsense. Now let me have my turn. So\nplease you, have you thought of bridges? How is our butcher to come, or\nour miller, our letters, or even our worthy beggars? We are shut off\nin front. Without building a boat can I ever hear even uncle Struan\npreach? Hark! I hear something like him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou frivolous Lallie! you are too bad. I cannot permit such views of\nthings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, papa, I never meant that. Only please to listen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe dark and deep stream, which now had grown to a width of some twelve\nyards perhaps, was gliding swiftly, but without a murmur, towards the\nbroad and watery moon. On the right-hand side, steep scars of chalk,\nshedding gleams of white rays, made the hollow places darker; while on\nthe other side, furzy tummocks, patches of briar, and tufted fallows\nspread the many-pointed light among their shadows justly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease to listen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d again said Alice, shrinking from her father, lest\nshe might be felt to tremble. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a plaintive, thrilling sound! It\nmust be a good banshee, I am sure; a banshee that knows how good we\nare, and protests against our extinction. There it is again--and there\nseems to be another wail inside of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA Chinese puzzle of noises, Lallie, and none of them very musical.\nYour ears are keener than mine, of course; but being extinct of\nromance, I should say that I heard a donkey braying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, now! papa, if it comes to that--and I said it was like Uncle\nStruan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice! But I beg his pardon, quite down on my knees, if you\nthink that it can be a donkey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am saved all the trouble of thinking about it. There he is, looking\nhard at us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, papa, he is not looking hard at us. He is looking most softly\nand sadly. What a darling donkey! and his nose is like a snowdrop!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nClearly in the moonlight shone, on the opposite bank of the Woeburn,\nthe nose of Jack the donkey. His wailings had been coming long, and\nhis supplications rising; he was cut off from his home, and fodder,\nand wholly beloved Bonny. And the wail inside a wail--as Alice had\ndescribed it--was the sound of the poor boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s woe, responsive to the\nforlorn appeal of Jack. On the brink of the cruel dividing water they\nmust have been for a long time striding up and down, over against each\nother, stretching fond noses vainly forward, and outvying one another\nin the luxury of poetic woe.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say a word, papa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe boy cannot see us here\nbehind this bush, and we can see him beautifully in the moonlight. I\nwant to know what he will do, so much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see what he can do except howl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered quietly:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand certainly he seems to possess remarkable powers in that way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBo-hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d wept Bonny in confirmation of this opinion;\nand \u00e2\u0080\u009ceke-haw, eke-haw,\u00e2\u0080\u009d from a nose of copious pathos, formed the\nelegiac refrain. Then having exhausted the well of weeping, the boy\nbecame fitter for reasoning. He wiped his eyes with his scarlet\nsleeves, and stretched forth his arms reproachfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Jack, Jack, Jack, whatever have I done to you? all the crumb of\nthe loaf you had, and the half of the very last orchard I run, and the\nprime of old Nanny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s short-horns, and if you wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pleased, you might\na\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said so all the morning, Jack. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s none in all the world as\nknoweth what you and I be, but one another. And there is none as careth\nfor either on us, only you and me, Jack. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee, Jack, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee go\nand run away. If \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee do, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give the thieves all as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve collected,\nand the rogues as calls us two waggabones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy poor boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland Lorraine, suddenly parting the bush\nbetween them, in fear of another sad boo-hoo--for Bonny had stirred his\nown depths, so that he was quite ready to start again--\u00e2\u0080\u009cmy poor boy,\nyou seem to be very unhappy about your donkey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBonny made answer to never a word. This woe belonged only to Jack and\nhimself. They could never think of being meddled with.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBonny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, in her soft sweet voice, and kindly touching him,\nas he turned away, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you wish to know how to recover your Jack? Would\nyou go a long way to get him back again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the outermost end of the world, Miss, if the whole of the way wor\nfuzz-bush. Miles and miles us have gone a\u00e2\u0080\u0099ready.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need not go quite to the end of the world. Instead of going up and\ndown these banks, keep steadily up the water. In about a mile you will\ncome to its head, if what I have heard of it is true; then keep well\nabove it, and round the hill, and you will meet the white-nosed donkey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHee-haw!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jack from the opposite bank, not without a whisk of\ntail. Then the boy, without a word of thanks, by reason of incredulity,\nwhistled a quick reply, and set off to test this doubtful theory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cObserve now the bliss of possessing a donkey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland began to\nmeditate; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not at all skilful in asses, whether golden, or\nleaden, or wooden, or even as described by \u00c3\u0086lian. But the contempt\nto which they are born, proves to my mind that they do not deserve\nit; or otherwise how would they get it? My sentence is clumsy. My\nidea--if there be one--has not managed to express itself. I hear the\nwhite-nosed donkey in the distance braying at me, with an overpowering\necho of contempt. I am unequal to this contest. Let me withdraw to my\nbook-room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, papa, you will do nothing of the sort. You are always\nwithdrawing to your book-room; and even I must not come in; and what\ngood ever comes of it? You must, if you please, make up your mind to\nmeet things very differently. And only think how long it is since we\nhave heard of poor Hilary! There are troubles coming, overwhelming\ntroubles, on all with the name or love of Lorraine, as sure as I stand,\nmy dear father, before you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I pray you to stand behind me, Alice. What an impulsive child it\nis! And the moonlight, my darling, has had some effect, as it always\nhas, wonderfully on such girls. You have worked yourself up, Lallie; I\ncan see it. My pet, I must watch you carefully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a mistake you make, papa! I never do anything of the sort. You\nseem to regard me as anybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child, to be reasoned with, out of a\nwindow. I may be supposed to say foolish things, and to imagine all\nsorts of nonsense; and, of course, I cannot reason, because it is not\nborn with us. And then, when I try, I have no chance whatever; though\nperfect justice is my aim; and--who comes lingering after me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour excellent father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered, kissing away his child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nexcitement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour loving father does all this, my pet, and brings you\nquite home to stern reason. And now he will take you home to your home.\nYou have caught the sad spirit of the donkey, petling; you long to go\nup and down this water, with some one to bewail you on the other side.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, papa, so I do. You are so clever! But I think I should go down\nand up, papa; if the quadruped you are thinking of went up and down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow Lallie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; and he said no more. For he knew that she hinted\nat Stephen Chapman, and wanted to fight her own battle against him,\nnow that she was in the humour. The father was ready to put off the\nconflict--as all good fathers must be--and he led his dear child up the\nhill, or let her lead him peacefully.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nTHE PLEDGE OF A LIFE.\n\n\nThree days of gloom and storm ensued upon the outbreak of the water;\nwhile the old house at the head of the Coombe in happy ignorance\nlooked down upon its hereditary foe. But dark foreboding and fine\nold stories agitated the loyal hearts of the domestics of the upper\nconclave,--that ancient butler Onesimus Binns, Mrs. Pipkins, and Mrs.\nMerryjack. With such uneasy feelings prevalent in the higher circle,\nnothing short of terror, or even panic, could be expected among the\ninferior dignitaries, now headed by John Trotman. This young man had\nlong shown himself so ambitious and aggressive, even \u00e2\u0080\u009ccockroaching\u00e2\u0080\u009d as\nMrs. Merryjack said, \u00e2\u0080\u009con the most sacred rights of his betters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that\nthe latter had really but one course left--to withdraw to their upper\nroom, and exclude \u00e2\u0080\u009call as didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to behave theirselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOf these unhappily there were too many; and they seemed to enjoy\nthemselves more freely after their degradation. For Trotman (though\nrapid of temper, perhaps, and given to prompt movements of the foot)\nwas not at all bad (when allowed his own way), and never kicked anybody\nwho offered to be kicked. So with his dictatorship firmly established\nin the lesser lower regions he became the most affable of mankind,\nand read all the crimes of the county to the maids and drew forth\nlong sighs of delicious horror, that his own brave self might console\nthem. And now, when they heard of the sombre Woeburn, with its dismal\nlegend, enhanced by ghastly utterances of ancient Nanny Stilgoe, and\ntidings brought through wailing winds of most appalling spectres, the\nstoutest heart was agitated with mysterious terror. At the creak of a\ndoor or the flit of a shadow, the rustle of a dry leaf, or the waving\nof a window-blind, the hoot of an owl, or even the silent creep of\ngloomy evening--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy goodness, Mary Ann, what was that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolly,\ncome closer, I hear something;\u00e2\u0080\u009d or, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJane, do \u00e2\u0080\u0099ee look behind the\nplate-screen;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then with one voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn, John, John, come down;\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dear man, John!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such was the state of the general nerve,\nas proved by many a special appeal from kitchen, back-kitchen, and\nscullery, pantry, terrible cellar, or lonesome wash-house; and the best\nof everything was kept for John.\n\nEven in the world of finer, feebler, and more foreign English; in\ndining-room, drawing-room, parlour, and book-room, and my lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nchamber, a mild uneasiness prevailed, and a sense of evil auspices.\nLady Valeria, most of all, who carried conservatism into relapse, felt\nthat troublous days were coming, and almost longed to depart in peace;\nor at any rate she said so. But with her keen mind, and legal insight,\nshe was bound to perceive that the authorized version of the other\nworld is democratic; as might be that of this world if Christianity\nmade Christians. Therefore her ladyship preferred to wait. Things might\nget better; and they could scarcely get worse. She had a good deal to\nsee to and settle among things strictly visible, and she threatened\neverybody with her decease; but did not prepare to make it.\n\nSir Roland Lorraine, on the other hand, paid little heed, of his own\naccord, to superstitious vanities. He found a good many instances,\nin classic, Persian, and Italian literature, of the outbreak of\nunderground waters; and there it was always a god who caused it--either\nby chasing river-nymphs, or by showing the power of a horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heels,\nor from benevolent motives, and a desire to water gardens. Therefore\nSir Roland gathered hope. He had not invested his mind as yet in\nimplicit faith in anything; but rather was inclined to be tolerant,\nand tentative, and diffident of his own opinions. And these not being\nparticularly strong, self-assertive, or self-important, and not being\nfounded on any rock, but held on the briefest building-lease, their\nowner, lease-holder, or tenant-at-will, was a very pleasant man to talk\nwith.\n\nThat means, of course, when he could be got to talk. And less and less\ncould he be got to talk, as the few people who had the key to his\nliking dropped off; and no others came. Never, even in his brightest\ndays, had he been wont to sparkle, flash, or even glow, in converse. He\nsimply had a soft large way of listening, and a small dry knack of so\ndiverting serious thought, that genial minds went roving. But now his\nown mind had grown more and more accustomed to go a-roving; and though,\nhaving never paid any attention to questions of science, or even to\nthe weather (now gradually becoming one of them), he could not satisfy\nhimself about the menacing appearance; in a very few hours he buried\nthe portent in a still more portentous pile of books.\n\nBut Alice, though fond of reading and of meditating in her little way,\nwas too full of youth and of healthy life, to retire into the classic\nages of even our English language. Her delight was rather in the\nwriters of the day, so many of whom were making themselves the writers\nof all future days--Coleridge, Wordsworth, Campbell, and above all\nothers, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cWizard of the North,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whose lays of romance and legend\nwere a spur that raised the clear spirit of Alice.\n\nOn the third day from the Woeburn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise, she sat in her garden bower,\nabsorbed in her favourite \u00e2\u0080\u009cLady of the Lake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her bower though damp and\nmossy, and dishevelled by the storms of autumn, was still a pleasant\nplace to rest in, when the view was clear and bright. The fairest\nview, however, now, and the most attractive study, were not of flower,\nand tree, and landscape, but of face and figure--the face of Alice\nLorraine, so gentle, pure, and rapt with poetic thought; and the\nperfect maiden form inspired by the roused nobility of the mind. The\nhair, in lines of flowing softness fallen back, disclosed the clear\ntranquillity of forehead, in contrast with the quick tremor of lip, and\nthe warmth that tinted, now and then, the delicate moulding of bright\nyoung cheeks. And as the sweet face, more and more lit up with sequent\nthought, and bowed with the flitting homage of a reader, genial tears\nfor dead and buried love, and grief, and gallantry arose, and glistened\nin dark grey eyes, and hung like the gem that quivers in the lashes of\nthe sun-dew.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlaize, Miss Halice, my leddy desireth to see you, at wonst, if you\nplaize, Miss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus spake the practical, and in appearance most unpoetical, Trotman,\nglancing at Alice, and then at her book, with more curiosity than he\ndurst convey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease to say that I will be with her as soon as I can\nfinish some important work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, speedily quenching Trotman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhope of finding out what she was reading, so as to melt the housemaids\ntherewith at night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, she always were a rum un,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered in\nhis disappointment, as he returned to his own little room, which he\nalways called his \u00e2\u0080\u009cstudy;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe captain will have to stand on his head\nto please her, or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m mistaken. Why, a body scarce dare look at her.\nSooner him than me, say I; although she is such a booty. But the old un\nwill give her her change I hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMeanwhile the young lady (unloved of Trotman, because she held fast\nby old Mr. Binns) put aside, with a sigh, both the poem and her own\npoetic dreamings, and proved that her temper, however strong, was sweet\nand large and well controlled, by bridling her now closed lips from\nany peevish exclamation. She waited a little time, until the glow of\nher cheeks abated, and the sparkle of her eyes was tranquil, and then\nshe put her pretty hat on (deep brown, trimmed with plumes of puce),\nand thinking no more of herself than that, set forth to encounter her\ngrandmother.\n\nBy this time Alice Lorraine had grown, from a sensitive spirited girl,\ninto a sensitive spirited woman. The things which she used to think and\nfeel to be right, she was growing to know to be right; and the fleeting\nof doubt from her face was beginning to form the soft expression.\nThat is to say--if it can be described, and happily it never can\nbe--goodwill, largeness of heart, rich mercy, sympathy and quick\ntenderness combined with grace and refinement, towards the perfection\nof womanly countenance.\n\nSo, whatever there was to be done, this Alice was always quite ready\nto do it. She had not those outlets for her active moods which young\nladies have at the present day, who find or form an unknown quantity of\nmost pressing duties. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, I have no time to marry anybody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they\nexclaim in a breathless manner; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I did, I must either neglect my\ndistrict, or my natural history.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPoor Alice had neither district, duck-weed net, nor even microscope;\nand what was even worse, she had no holy priest to guide her thoughts,\nno texts to work in moss and sago, nor even any croquet. Whatever she\ndid, she had to do without any rush of the feminine mind into masculine\nchannels prepared for it; and even without any partnership of dear and\ngood companions. So that the fight before her was to be fought out by\nherself alone.\n\nThis was the last quiet day of her life; the last day for thinking of\nlittle things; the last day of properly feeding her pets, her poultry,\nand tame hares, and pigeons, self-important robins (perched upon their\nown impudence), and sweetly trustful turtle-doves, that have no dream\nof evil. She fed them all; and if it were not her last day of feeding\nthem, it was the last time she could feed them happily, and without\nenvying their minds.\n\nThis was that important work, which she was bound to attend to,\nbefore she could hurry to the side of her grandmother. That fine old\nlady always made a point of sending for Alice, whenever she knew\nher need--or rather, without knowing, needed the relief of a little\nexplosion. Her dignity strictly barred this outlet towards those\ncreatures of a lower creation, who had the bliss of serving her. To\nall such people she was most forbearing, in a large and liberal style;\nbecause it must be so impossible for them at all to understand her.\nAnd, for this courteous manner, every woman in the place disliked her.\nThe men, however, having slower perceptions, thought that her ladyship\nwas quite right. They could make allowances for her--that they could;\nand after all, if you come to think of it, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfemmel\u00e2\u0080\u009d race was most\naggravating. So they listened to what the women had to tell; and\nwithout contradiction wisely let female opinion waste itself.\n\nLady Valeria Lorraine, though harassed and weakened by rheumatism and\npain of the nerves (which she sternly attributed to the will of God and\nthe weather), still sat as firmly erect as ever, and still exacted, by\na glance alone, all those little attentions which she looked so worthy\nto receive. The further she became removed from the rising generation,\nthe greater was the height of contempt from which she deigned to look\ndown upon it. So that Alice used to say to her father sometimes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwonder whether I have any right to exist. Grandmamma seems to think it\nso impertinent of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne thing is certain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered,\nwith a quiet smile at his favourite; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that is, that you cannot\nexist without impertinence, my dear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis fine old lady was dressed with her usual taste and elaboration;\nno clumsy chits would she have to help her, during the three hours\noccupied, by what she termed, most truly, her \u00e2\u0080\u009cdevotions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She wore a\nmaroon-coloured velvet gown of the softest and richest fabric, trimmed,\nnot too profusely, with exquisite point-lace; while her cap, of the\nsame lace, with dove-coloured ribbon, at the same time set off and\nwas surpassed by the beauty of her snow-white hair. Among many other\nsmall crotchets, she held that brilliants did not suit a very old lady;\nand she wore no jewels, except a hoop of magnificent pearls with a\nturquoise setting, to preserve her ancient wedding-ring. And now, as\nher grandchild entered quietly, she was a little displeased at delay,\nand feigned to hear no entrance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere I am, grandmamma, if you please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, after three\nmost graceful curtseys, which she was always commanded to make, and\nmade with much private amusement; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you please to look round,\ngrandmamma, and tell me what you want of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could scarcely have dreamed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lady Valeria, slowly turning\ntowards her grandchild, and smiling with superior dignity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat any\nmember of our family would use the very words of the clown in the ring.\nBut, perhaps, as I always try to think, you are more to be pitied than\ncondemned. Partly through your own fault, and partly through peculiar\ncircumstances, you have lost those advantages which a young lady of our\nhouse is entitled to. You have never been at Court; you have seen no\nsociety; you have never even been in London!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! it is all too true, grandmamma. But how often have you told me\nthat I never must hope, in this degenerate age, to find any good model\nto imitate! And you have always discouraged me, by presenting yourself\nas the only one for me to follow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are quite right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the ancient lady, failing to observe the\nturn of thought, as Alice was certain that she would do, else scarcely\nwould she have ventured it; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you do not make the most of even that\nadvantage. You can read and write, perhaps better than you ought, or\nbetter than used to be thought at all needful; but you cannot come into\na room, or make a tolerable curtsey; and you spend all your time with\ndogs, and poets, and barrows of manure, and little birds!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow really, madam, you are too hard upon me. I may have had a\nbarrow-load of poets; but more than a month ago, you gave orders that I\nwas not to have one bit more of manure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly I did, and high time it was. A young gentlewoman to dabble\nin worms, and stable-stuff, and filthiness! However, I did not send for\nyou to speak about such little matters. What I have to say is for your\nown good; and I will trouble you not to be playing with your hands, but\njust listen to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, gently; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not know I was moving\nmy hands. I will listen, without doing that any more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, my dear child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d began Lady Valeria, being softened by the dutiful\nmanner and sweet submission of the girl: \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhatever we do is for your\nown good. You are not yet old enough to judge what things may profit,\nand what may hurt you. Even I, who had been brought up in a wholly\nsuperior manner, could not at your age have thought of anything. I was\nready to be led by wiser people; although I had seen a good deal of\nthe world. And you, who have seen nothing, must be only too glad to do\nthe same. You know quite well, what has long been settled, between your\ndear father and myself, about what is to be done with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be done with me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed poor Alice, despite her resolve to hold\nher tongue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be done with me! As if I were just a bundle of rags, to\nbe got rid of!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProuder and handsomer girls than you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lady Valeria,\nquietly--for she loved to provoke her grandchild, partly because it was\nso hard to do--\u00e2\u0080\u009chave become bundles of rags, by indulging just such a\ntemper as yours is. You will now have the goodness to listen to me,\nwithout any vulgar excitement. Your marriage with Captain Chapman has\nfor a very long time been agreed upon. It is high time now to appoint\nthe day. Sir Remnant Chapman has done me the honour of a visit upon\nthat subject. He is certainly a man of the true old kind; though his\nbirth is comparatively recent. I was pleased with him; and I have\npledged myself to the marriage, within three months from this day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt cannot be! it shall not be! You may bury me, but not marry me. Who\ngave you the right to sell me? And who made me to be sold? You selfish,\ncold-hearted--no, I beg your pardon. I know not what I am saying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may well fall away, child, and cower like that; when you have\ndared to use such dreadful words. No, you may come to yourself, as\nyou please. I am not going to give you any volatile salts, or ring,\nand make a scene of it. That is just what you would like; and to be\npetted afterwards. I hope you have not hurt yourself, so much as you\nhave hurt me perhaps, by your violent want of self-control. I am not\nan old woman--as you were going to call me--but an elderly lady. And I\nhave lived indeed to be too old, when any one descended from me has so\nlittle good blood in her as to call her grandmother an old woman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very, very, sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, with catches of breath, as she\nspoke, and afraid to trust herself yet to rise from the chair, into\nwhich she had fallen; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI used no such words, that I can remember. But\nI spoke very rudely, I must confess. I scarcely know what I am to do,\nwhen I hear such dreadful things; unless I bite my tongue off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI quite agree with you. And I believe it is the very best thing all\nyoung people can do. But I strive to make every allowance for you,\nbecause you have been so very badly brought up. Now come to this\nwindow, child, and look out. Tut, tut--tears, indeed! What are young\ngirls made of now? White sugar in a wet tea-cup. Now if the result of\nyour violence allows you to see anything at all, perhaps you will tell\nme what that black line is, among the rough ground, at the bottom of\nthe hill. To me it is perfectly clear, although I am such a very old\nwoman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, of course, it is the Woeburn, madam. It has been there for three\ndays.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know what it means; and you calmly tell me that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that it means harm, of course. But I really could not help its\ncoming. And it has not done any harm as yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Alice, it waits its due time, of course. Three months is its time,\nI believe, for running, before it destroys the family. Your marriage\naffords the only chance of retrieving the fortunes of this house, so\nas to defy disasters. Three months, therefore, is the longest time to\nwhich we can possibly defer it. How many times have we weakly allowed\nyou to slip out of any certain day. But now we have settled that you\nmust be Mrs. Chapman by the 15th of January at the latest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, grandmamma, to think that I ever should live to be called Mrs.\nChapman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe name is a very good one, Alice, though it may not sound very\nromantic. But poor Sir Remnant, I fear, is unlikely to last for a great\ntime longer. He seemed so bent, and his sight so bad, and requiring so\nmuch refreshment! And then, of course, you would be Lady Chapman if you\ncare about such trifles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a piteous prospect, madam. And I think Captain Chapman must\nbe older than his father. You know the old picture, \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Downhill of\nLife;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the excellent and affectionate couple, descending so nicely\nhand-in-hand. Well, I should illustrate that at once. I should have to\nlead my--no, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call him husband--but my tottering partner down\nthe hill, whenever we came to see you and papa. Oh, that would be so\ninteresting!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou silly child, you might do much worse than that. Lady de Lampnor\nhas promised most kindly to see to your outfit in London. But I cannot\ntalk of that at present. There now you may go. I have told you all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, grandmamma. But, if you please, I have not told you all,\nnor half. It need not, however, take very long. It is just this. No\npower on earth shall ever compel me to marry Stephen Chapman; unless,\nindeed it were so to happen----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou disobedient and defiant creature--unless what should happen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnless the existence, and even the honour, of the Lorraines required\nit. But of that I see no possibility at all. At present it seems to\nbe nothing more than a small and ignominious scheme. More and more\nI despise and dislike that heroic officer. I will not be sacrificed\nfor nothing; and I have not the smallest intention of being the\npurchase-money for old acres.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter that I shall leave you to your father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Lady Valeria,\ngrowing tired. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may amuse you to talk so largely, and perhaps for\nthe moment relieves you. But your small self-will and your childish\nfancies, cannot be always gratified. However, I will ask you one\nthing. If the honour, and even the life of Lorraine can be shown to you\nto require it, will you sacrifice your noble self?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Alice, with brave eyes flashing, and looking tall\nand noble. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the honour of the Lorraines depends upon me, I will give\nmyself and my life for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nA HERO\u00e2\u0080\u0099S RETURN.\n\n\nHilary was so weak and weary, and so seriously ill, when at last he\nreached the rectory, that his uncle and aunt would not hear of his\ncoming downstairs for a couple of days at least. They saw that his best\nchance of escaping some long and perhaps fatal malady was to be found\nin rest and quietude, nursing, and kindly feeding. And the worst of it\nwas that, whatever they did, they could not bring him to feed a quarter\nso kindly as he ought to do. The Rector said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cConfound the fellow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nand Mrs. Hales shook her head, and cried \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d as dish after\ndish, and dainty little plate, came out of his room untasted.\n\nAnd now, on the morning of that same day on which Alice thus had\npledged herself (being the third from her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival, of which\nshe was wholly ignorant), the Rector of West Lorraine arose, and\ngirded himself, and ate his breakfast with no small excitement. He had\nreceived a new clerical vestment of the loftiest symbolism, and he\nhoped to exhibit it at the head of a very long procession.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout poor Hilary? What am I to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mrs. Hales, coming into the\nlobby, to see her good husband array himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll sorts of things may\nhappen while you are away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Caroline, how can you ask such a question? Feed, feed, feed;\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the line of treatment. And above all things, lock up your\nmedicine-chest. He wants no squills, or scammony, or even your patent\nelectuary--of all things the most abominable; though I am most\nungrateful to call it so--for I owe to it half my burial-fees. He wants\nno murderous doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stuff: he wants a good breakfast--that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what he\nwants.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, my dear, you forget,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered good Mrs. Hales, who kept a small\nwardrobe of bottles, and pills, gallipots, powders, and little square\nscales; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are quite overlooking the state of his tongue. He has not\neaten the size of my little finger. Why? Why, because of the fur on his\ntongue!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBless the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongue, and yours too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should\nnot care twopence about his tongue, if he only used his teeth\nproperly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, Struan, Struan! those who have never known what ache or pain\nis, cannot hope to understand the system. I know exactly how to\ntreat him--a course of gentle drastics first, and then three days of\nmy electuary, and then cardamomum, exhibited with liquor potassy.\nDoctoring has always been in my dear mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family; and when your\ntime comes to be ill and weak, how often you will thank Providence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank the Lord for all things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the parson, who was often of a\nreligious turn: \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I must be brought very low indeed, ere I thank Him\nfor your electuary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut on your new hunting-coat, my dear. There it hangs, and I know that\nyou are dying to exhibit it. The vanity of men surpasses even the love\nof women. There, there! You never will learn how to put a coat on. Just\ncome to the hall-chair, for me to pull it up. You are so unreasonably\ntall, that you never can get your coat up at the neck. Now, will you\nhave it done, or will you go as you are, and look a regular figure in\nthe saddle? You call it a \u00e2\u0080\u0098bottle-green\u00e2\u0080\u0099! I call it a green, without\nthe bottle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCaroline, sometimes you are most provoking. It is not your nature; but\nyou try to do it. The cloth is of quite an invisible green, as the man\nin London told me--manufactured on purpose for ecclesiastics; though\nhundreds of parsons, God knows, go after the hounds in the good old\nscarlet. If you say any more, I will order a scarlet, and keep West\nGrinstead in countenance. They always do it in the West of England. In\ninvisible green, I am a hypocrite.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excite yourself, Struan, or you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy your opening\nday at all. And I am sure that the green is as bright as can be; and\nyou look very well--very well indeed. Though I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite see how you\ncan button it. Perhaps it is meant for a button-hook, or a leather\nthong over your stomach, dear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is meant to fit me, Mrs. Hales; and it fits me to a nicety. It\ncould not fit better; and it will be too easy, when we have had a few\nhard runs. Where are my daughters? They know a good fit; and they know\nhow to put a thing on my shoulders. Carry, Madge, and Cecil, come\nto the rescue of your father. Your father is baited, worse than any\nbadger. Come all of you; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop a minute, or get perverted by your\nmother. Now, in simple truth, what do you say to this, my dears? Each\nspeak her own opinion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt suits you most beautifully, papa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, I think that I never saw you look a quarter so well before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear father, if there are any ladies, mamma will have reason to be\njealous. But I fear that I see the back-seam starting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou clever little Cecil, I am afraid that it is. I feel a relief in\nmy--ahem!--I mean an uncomfortable looseness in the chest. I told the\nfellow forty-eight inches at least. He has scamped the cloth, the\nLondon rascal! However, we can spare it from round the waist, as soon\nas our poor Cobble can see to it. But for to-day--ah yes, well thought\nof! My darling, go and get some of your green purse-silk. You can\nherring-bone it so as to last for the day at least. Your mother will\nshow you how to do it. Madge, tell Bonny to run and tell Robert not to\nbring the mare yet for a quarter of an hour. Now, ladies, I am at your\nmercy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, papa dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Cecil, as she stitched away at the seam of her\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s burly back; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif poor Cousin Hilary should get up and want to\ngo out, what are we to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can you even put such a question? Even on our opening day, I would\nnot dream of leaving the house, if I thought that you could be so\nstupid as to let that poor boy out. I would not have him seen in the\nparish, and I would not have his own people see him, even for the brush\nof the Fox-coombe fox, who is older than the hills, they say, and no\nhound dare go near him. One of you must be always handy; and if he gets\nrestless, turn the key on him. Nothing can be simpler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith his bottle-green coat, now warranted to last (unless he\nover-buttoned it), the Rector kissed his dear wife and daughters; and\nthen universal good wishes, applauses, and kissings of hand, set him\nforth on his way, with a bright smile spread upon his healthy face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow mind, we are left in charge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Madge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are his doctor, of\ncourse, mamma; but we are to be his constables. I hope to goodness that\nhe will eat by-and-by. It makes me so miserable to see him. And the\ntrouble we have had to keep the servants from knowing who he is, mamma!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear, your father has ordered it so. For my part, I cannot see why\nthere should be so much mystery about it. But he always knows better\nthan we do, of course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely, mamma,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggested Cecil, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit would be a dreadful shock to\nthe family to receive poor Hilary in such a condition, just after\nthe appearance of that horrid water. They would put the two things\ntogether, and believe it the beginning of great calamities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, my dear child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mrs. Hales, who loved to speak a word in\nseason; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet not us, who are Christians, hearken to such superstitious\nvanities. Trust in the Lord, and all will be well. He holdeth in the\nhollow of his hands the earth and all that therein is; yea, and the\nwaters that be under the earth. Now run up, and see whether your poor\ncousin has eaten that morsel of anchovy toast. And tell him that I am\ngoing to prepare his draught; but he must not take the pills until\nhalf-past eleven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, mamma dear, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll drive him out of the house. Poor fellow, how I\ndo pity him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow Hilary certainly deserved this pity--not for his bodily ailments\nonly, and the cruel fate which had placed him at the mercy of the\nmedicine-chest, but more especially for the low and feverish condition\nof his heart and mind. Brooding perpetually on his disgrace, and\nattributing to himself more blame than his folly and failure demanded,\nhe lost the refreshment of dreamless sleep, which his jaded body called\nout for. No rest could he find in the comforting words of his uncle and\naunt and cousins: he knew that they were meant for comfort, and such\nknowledge vexes; or at least it irritates a man, until the broader time\nof life, when things are taken as they are meant, and any good word is\nwelcome.\n\nHe was not, however, so very far gone as to swallow his dear aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nboluses. He allowed his pillow to take his pills; and his good-natured\ncousins let him swallow them, as much as a juggler swallows swords.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take them while you are looking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen you come in\nagain you will find them gone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow one of the girls--it was never known which, because all three\ndenied it--stupidly let the sick cousin know that the master of the\nhouse was absent. Hilary paid no special heed at the moment when\nhe heard it; but after a while he began to perceive (as behoved a\nblockaded soldier) that here was his chance for a sally. And he told\nthem so, after his gravy-beef and a raw egg beaten up with sherry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow cunning you are now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cecil, who liked and admired him\nvery deeply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you are not quite equal, Master Captain, to female\ningenuity. The Spanish ladies must have taught you that, if half that\nI hear is true of them. Now you need not look so wretched, because I\nknow nothing about them. Only this I know, that out of this house you\nare not allowed to go, without--oh, what do you call it?--a pass, or a\nwatchword, or a countersign, or something or other from papa himself.\nSo you may just as well lie down--or mamma will come up with a powder\nfor you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe will of the Lord be done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, Cecil, you are\ngetting very pretty, and you need not take away my breeches.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry to do it, Cousin Hilary; but I know quite well what I am\nabout. And none of your military ways of going on can mislead me as to\nyour character. You want to be off. We are quite aware of it. You can\nscarcely put two feet to the ground.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh dear, how many ought I to be able to put?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know best--at least four, I should hope. But you are not equal to\nargument. And we are all particularly ordered to keep you from what is\ntoo much for you. Now I shall take away these things--whatever they are\ncalled, I have no idea; but I do what I am told to do. And after this\nyou will take that glass of red wine declared to be wonderful; and then\nyou will shut both your eyes, if you please, till my father comes home\nfrom his hunting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lively girl departed with a bow of light defiance, carrying away\nher father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s small clothes (which had been left for Hilary), and\nlocking the door of his bedroom with a decisive turn of a heavy key.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, you may go to sleep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as she ran down into the\ndrawing-room: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI defy him to go, if he were Jack Sheppard: he has got\nno breeches to go in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCecil, you are almost too clever! How your father will laugh, to be\nsure!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the excellent lady began her nap.\n\nAs the afternoon wore away, Hilary grew more and more impatient of\nhis long confinement. Not only that he pined for the open air--as, of\ncourse, he must do, after living so long with the free sky for his\ncanopy--but also that he felt most miserable at being so near the old\nhouse on the hill, yet doubtful of his reception there. More than once\nhe rang the bell; but the old nurse, who alone of the servants was\nallowed to enter, would do no more than scold or coax him, and quietly\nlock him in again. So at last he got out of bed, and feebly made his\nway to the window, and thence beheld, betwixt him and the grassy mounds\nof the churchyard, that swift black stream which had so surprised him\non the night of his arrival.\n\nSince then he had been persuaded himself, or allowed others to persuade\nhim, that the water had been a vision only of his weak and exited\nbrain. But now he saw it clearly, calmly, and in a very few moments\nknew what it was, and of what dark import.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can I have let them keep me here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, with indignation.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father and sister must believe me dead, while I play at this\nmiserable hide-and-seek. Perhaps they will think that I had better have\nbeen dead; but, at any rate, they shall know the truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these words he took up his sailor-clothes, which the clever Cecil\nhad overlooked, and which had been left in his room for fear of setting\nthe servants talking; and he dressed himself as well as he could, and\ntried to look clean and tidy. But do what he might, he could only cut a\npoor and sorry figure; and looking in the glass, he was frightened at\nhis wan and worn appearance. Then, knowing the habits of the house, and\nwishing to avoid excitement, he waited until the two elder daughters\nwere gone down the village for their gossip, and Cecil was seeing the\npotatoes dug, and Mrs. Hales sleeping over Fisher or Patrick, while the\ncook was just putting the dinner down; and then, without trying the\ndoor at all, he quietly descended from the window, with the help of a\nstack-pipe and a spurry pear-tree.\n\nSo feeble was he now, that this slight exertion made him turn faint,\nand sick, and giddy; and he was obliged to sit down and rest under a\nshrub, into which he had staggered. But after a while, he found himself\ngetting a little better; and, pulling up one of the dahlia-stakes, to\nhelp himself along with, he made his way to the gate; and there being\ncut off from the proper road, followed the leave of the land and the\nwater, along the valley upward.\n\nAlice Lorraine had permitted herself not quite to lose her temper,\nbut still to get a little worried by her grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exhortations.\nOf all living beings, she felt herself to be one of the very most\nreasonable; and whenever she began to doubt about it, she knew there\nwas something wrong with her. Her favourite cure for this state of mind\nwas a free and independent ride, over the hills and far away. She hated\nto have a groom behind her, watching her, and perhaps criticising the\nmovements of her figure. But as it was scarcely the proper thing for\nMiss Lorraine to be scouring the country, like a yeoman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, she\nalways had to start with a trusty groom; but she generally managed to\nget rid of him.\n\nAnd now, having vainly coaxed her father to come for a breezy canter,\nAlice set forth about four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, for an hour of rapid air to clear,\ninvigorate, and enliven her. Whatever she did, or failed of doing (when\nher grandmother was too much for her), she always looked graceful,\nand bright, and kind. But she never looked better than when she was\nsitting, beautifully straight, on her favourite mare, skimming the\nsward of the hills; or bowing her head in some tangled covert. This\nday, she allowed the groom to chase her (like the black care that sits\nbehind) until she had taken free burst of the hills, and longed to see\nthings quietly. And then she sent him, in the kindest manner, to a very\nold woman at Lower Chancton, to ask whether she had been frightened;\nand, when he had turned the corner of a difficult plantation, Alice\ntook her course for that which she had made up her mind to do.\n\nAccording to the ancient stories, no fair-blooded creatures (such as\nman, or horse, cow, dog, or pigeon) would ever put lip to the accursed\nstream; whereas all foul things, pole-cats, foxes, fitches, badgers,\nravens, and the like, were drawn by it, as by a loadstone, and made\na feasting-place of it. So Alice resolved that her darling \u00e2\u0080\u009cElfrida\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d should be compelled to pant with thirst, and then should have the\nfairest offer of the water of the Woeburn. And of this intent she was\nso full, that she paid no heed to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdressing bell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d clanging over\nthe lonely hill, nor even to her pet mare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sense of dinner; but took a\nshort cut of her own knowledge, down a lonely borstall, to the channel\nof new waters.\n\nThe stream had risen greatly even since the day before yesterday, and\nnow in full volume swept on grandly towards the river Adur. Any one who\nmight chance to see it for the first time, and without any impression,\nor even idea concerning it, could scarcely fail to observe how it\ndiffered from ordinary waters. Not only through its pellucid blackness,\nand the swaying of long grass under it (whose every stalk, and sheath,\nand awn, and even empty glume, was clear, as they quivered, wavered,\nsevered, and spread, or sheafed themselves together again, and hustled\nin their common immersion),--not only in this, and the absence of any\nwater-plants along its margin, was the stream peculiar, but also in\nits force and flow. It did not lip, or lap, or ripple, or gurgle, or\nwimple, or even murmur, as all well-meaning rivers do; but swept on in\none even sweep, with a face as smooth as the best plate-glass, and the\nsilent slide of nightfall.\n\nNow the truth of the old saying was made evident to Alice, that one\ncan take a horse to water, but a score cannot make him drink, unless\nhe is so minded. Though it was not an easy thing to get Elfrida to the\nwater. She started away with flashing eyes, pricked ears, and snorting\nnostrils; and nothing but perfect faith in Alice would have made her\neven come anigh. But as for drinking, or even wetting her nose in that\nblack liquid--might the horse-fiend seize her, if she dreamed of doing\na thing so dark and unholy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall, you shall, you wicked little witch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice, who\nwas often obstinate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean to drink it; and we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any\nsuperstition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She leaped off lightly, with her skirt tucked up, and\ntaking the mare by the cheek-piece of the bridle, drew her forward.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome along, come along! you shall drink! If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pour it up\nyour nostrils, Frida; somehow or other, you shall swallow it. You know\nI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any nonsense, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe beautiful filly, with great eyes partly defiant and partly\nsuppliant, drew back her straight nose, and blowing nostrils, and the\nglistening curve of the foamy lip. Not even a hair of her muzzle should\ntouch the face of the accursed water.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, then, you shall have it thus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice, with her curved\npalm brimming with the unpopular liquid; when suddenly a shadow fell on\nthe shadowy brilliance before her--a shadow distinct from her own and\nElfrida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and cast further into the wavering.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice, turning sharply round; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what business\nhave you on my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She was in the greatest fright at the\nsudden appearance of a foreign sailor, and the place so lonely and\nbeyond all help; but without thinking twice, she put a brave face on\nher terror.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho am I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hilary, trying to get up a sprightly laugh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\nthink you must have seen me once or twice in the course of your long\nlife, Miss Lorraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Hilary, Hilary, Hilary!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe threw herself into his arms with a jump, relying upon his\naccustomed strength, and without any thought of the difference. He\ntottered backwards, and must have fallen, but for the trunk of a\npollard ash. And seeing how it was, she again cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Hilary,\nHilary, Hilary!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is my name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, after kissing her in a timid manner;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut not my nature; at the present moment I am not so very hilarious.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you are not fit to walk, or talk, or even to look like a hero.\nYou are the bravest fellow that ever was born. Oh, how proud we are\nof you! My darling, what is the matter? Why, you look as if you did\nnot know me! Help, help, help! He is going to die. Oh, for God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake,\nhelp!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPoor Hilary, after looking wildly around, and trying in vain to command\nhis mouth, fell suddenly back, convulsed, distorted, writhing, foaming,\nand wallowing in the depths of epilepsy. Sky, hill, and tree swung to\nand fro, across his strained and starting eyes, and then whirled round\nlike a spinning-wheel, with radiating sparks and spots. Then all fell\ninto abyss of darkness, down a bottomless pit, into utter and awful\nloss of everything.\n\nThe vigour of youth had fought against this robbery of humanity so\nlong and hard that Alice, the only spectator of the conflict, began to\nrecover from shriek and wailing at the time that her brother fell into\nthe black insensibility. The ground sloped so that if she had not been\nthere, the unfortunate youth must have rolled into the Woeburn, and so\nended. But being a prompt and active girl, she had saved him from this\nat any rate. She had had the wit also to save his tongue, by slipping\na glove between his teeth; which scarcely a girl in a hundred, who\nsaw such a thing for the first time, would have done. And now, though\nher face was bathed in tears, and her hands almost as tremulous as if\nthemselves convulsed, she filled her low-crowned riding-hat with water\nfrom the river, and sprinkled his forehead gently, and released his\nneck from cumbrance. And then she gazed into his thin pale features,\nand listened for the beating of his heart.\n\nThis was so low that she could not hear or even feel it anywhere.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, how can I get him home?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, my only brother, my\nonly brother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d In fright and misery she leaped upon a crest of chalk,\nto seek around for any one to help her; and suddenly she espied her\ngroom against the skyline, a long way off, galloping up the ridge from\nChancton. In hope that one of the many echoes of the cliffs might\naid her, she shrieked with all her power, and tore a white kerchief\nfrom under her riding-habit, and put it on her whip and waved it. And\npresently she had the joy of seeing the horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head turned towards\nher. The rider had not caught her voice, but had descried some white\nthing fluttering between him and the sombre stripe which he was\nwatching earnestly.\n\nThis groom was a strong and hearty man, and the father of seven\nchildren. He made the best of the case, and ventured to comfort his\nyoung mistress. And then he laid Hilary upon Elfrida, the docile and\nsoft-stepper; and making him fast with his own bridle, and other quick\ncontrivances, he tethered his own horse to a tree, and leading the\nmare, set off, with Alice walking carefully and supporting the head of\nher senseless brother. So came this hero, after all his exploits, back\nto the home of his fathers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nTHE GRAVE OF THE ASTROLOGER.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can I do? Oh, how can I escape?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice to herself one\nmorning, towards the end of dreary November; \u00e2\u0080\u009cone month out of three\nis gone already, and the chain of my misery tightens round me. No,\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come near me, any of you birds; you will have to do without me\nsoon; and you had better begin to practise. Ah me! you can make your\nown nests, and choose your mates; how I envy you! Well, then, if you\nmust be fed, you must. Why should I be so selfish?\u00e2\u0080\u009d With tears in her\neyes, she went to her bower and got her little basket of moss, well\nknown to every cock-robin, and thrush, and blackbird, dwelling on the\npremises. At the bottom were stored, in happy ignorance of the fate\nbefore them, all the delicacies of the season--the food of woodland\nsong, the stimulants of aerial melody. Here were woodlice, beetles,\nearwigs, caterpillars, slugs, and nymphs, well-girt brandlings, and\nthe offspring of the tightly-buckled wasp, together with the luscious\nmeal-worm, and the peculiarly delicious grub of the cockchafer--all as\nfresh as a West-end salmon, and savouring sweetly of moss and milk--no\nwonder the beaks of the birds began to water at the mere sight of that\nbasket.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have had enough now for to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is useless to put\nall your heads on one side, and pretend that you are just beginning.\nI know all your tricks quite well by this time. No, not even you, you\nMethuselah of a Bob, can have any more--or at least, not much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor this robin (her old pet of all, and through whose powers of\ninterpretation the rest had become so intimate) made a point of\nperching upon her collar, and nibbling at her ear, whenever he felt\nhimself neglected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no friend like an old friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his\nmotto; and his poll was grey, and his beak quite blunted with feeding a\nscore of families, and his large black eyes were fading. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMethuselah,\ncome and help yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, relenting softly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will not\nhave the chance much longer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow, as soon as the birds, with a chirp and a jerk, and one or two\nfurtive hops, had realised the stern fact that there was no more for\nthem, and then had made off to their divers business (but all with an\neye to come back again), Alice, with a smiling sigh--if there can be\nsuch a mixture--left her pets, and set off alone to have a good walk,\nand talk, and think. The birds, being guilty of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccupboard love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d were\ncontent to remain in their trees and digest; and as many of them as\nwere in voice expressed their gratitude brilliantly. But out of the\ncover they would not budge; they hated to be ruffled up under their\ntails: and they knew what the wind on the Downs was.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall march off straight for Chancton Ring,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice Lorraine,\nmost resolutely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow thankful I am, to be able to walk! and poor\nHilary--ah, how selfish of me to contrast my state with his!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBriskly she mounted the crest of the coombe, and passed to the open\nupland, the long chine of hill which trends to its highest prominence\nat Chancton Ring--a land-mark for many a league around. Crossing\nthe trench of the Celtic camp--a very small obstruction now--which\nloosely girds the ancient trees, Alice entered the vegetable throng of\nweather-beaten and fantastic trunks. These are of no great size, and\nshed no impress of hushed awe, as do the mossy ramparts and columnar\nmajesty of New Forest beech-trees. Yet, from their countless and\nfurious struggles with the winds in their might in the wild midnight,\nand from their contempt of aid or pity in their loneliness, they\nenforce the respect and the interest of any who sit beneath them.\n\nAt the foot of one of the largest trees, the perplexed and disconsolate\nAlice rested on a lowly mound, which held (if faith was in tradition)\nthe bones of her native ancestor, the astrologer Agasicles. The\ntree which overhung his grave, perhaps as a sapling had served to\nrest (without obstructing) his telescope; and the boughs, whose\nmurmurings soothed his sleep, had been little twigs too limp for him\nto hang his Samian cloak on. Now his descendant in the ninth or tenth\ngeneration--whichever it was--had always been endowed with due (but\nmainly rare) respect for those who must have gone before her. She could\nnot perceive that they must have been fools, because many things had\nhappened since they died; and she was not even aware that they must\nhave been rogues, to beget such a set of rogues.\n\nTherefore she had veneration for the remains that lay beneath her\n(mouldering in no ugly coffin, but in swaddling-clothes, committed\nlike an infant into the mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bosom), and the young woman dwelt,\nas all mortals must, on death, when duly put to them. The everlasting\nsorrow of the moving winds was in the trees; and the rustling of the\nsad, sere leaf, and creaking of the lichened bough. And above their\nlittle bustle, and small fuss about themselves, the large, sonorous\nstir was heard of Weymouth pines and Scottish firs, swaying in the\ndistance slowly, like the murmur of the sea. Even the waving of yellow\ngrass-blades (where the trees allowed them), and the ruffling of tufted\nbriars, and of thorny thickets, shone and sounded melancholy, with a\nfarewell voice and gaze.\n\nIn the midst of all this autumn sound, Alice felt her spirits fall.\nShe knew that they were low before, and she was here to enlarge and\nlift them, with the breadth of boundless prospect, and the height\nof the breezy hill. But fog and cloud came down the weald, and grey\nencroachment creeping, and on the hill-tops lay some heavy sense of\ndesolation. And Alice being at heart in union with the things around\nher (although she tried to be so brave), began to be weighed down,\nand lonesome, sad, and wondering, and afeared. From time to time she\nglanced between the uncouth pillars of the trees, to try to be sure of\nno man being in among them hiding. And every time when she saw no one,\nshe was so glad that she need not look again--and then she looked again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is quite early,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to herself; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing--not even three\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. I get into the stupidest, fearfullest ways, from such\ncontinual nursing. How I wish poor Hilary was here! One hour of this\nfine breeze and cheerful scene----My goodness, what was that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe cracking of a twig, without any sign of what had cracked it; the\nrustle of trodden leaves; but no one, in and out the graves of leafage,\nvisible to trample them. And then the sound of something waving, and a\nsharp snap as of metal, and a shout into the distant valley.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the astrologer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought Alice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, why did I laugh at him? He\nhas felt me sitting on his dear old head. He is waving his cloak, and\nsnapping his casket. He has had me in view for his victim always, and\nnow he is shouting for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn confirmation of this opinion, a tall grey form, with one arm thrown\nup, and a long cloak hanging gracefully, came suddenly gliding between\nthe trees. The maiden, whose brain had been overwrought, tried to\nspring up with her usual vigour; but her power failed her. She fell\nback against the sepulchral trunk and did not faint, but seemed for the\nmoment very much disposed thereto.\n\nWhen she was perfectly sure of herself, and rid of all presence of\nspectres, she found a strong arm behind her head, and somebody leaning\nover her. And she laid both hands before her face, without meaning any\nrudeness; having never been used to be handled at all, except by her\nbrother or father.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon most humbly, madam. But I was afraid of your\nknocking yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I thank you. I was very foolish. But now I am quite well again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you take my hand to get up? I am sure, I was scared as much as\nyou were.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, if I could only believe that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy self-respect would\nsoon return; for you do not seem likely to be frightened very easily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was blushing already; and now her confusion deepened, with the\nconsciousness that the stranger might suppose her to be admiring his\nmanly figure; of which, of course, she had not been thinking, even for\none moment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought not to be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, in the simplest manner possible;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I had a sunstroke in America, fifteen months ago or so; and since\nthat I have been good for nothing. May I tell you who I am?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes, I should like so much to know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alice was surprised at herself\nas she spoke; but the stranger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unusually simple yet most courteous\nmanner led her on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am one Joyce Aylmer, not very well known; though at one time I hoped\nto become so. A major in his Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service\u00e2\u0080\u009d--here he lifted his hat\nand bowed--\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut on the sick-list, ever since we fought the Americans at\nFort Detroit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Major Aylmer, I have often heard of you, and how you fell into a\nsad brain-fever, through saving the life of a poor little child. My\nuncle, Mr. Hales, knows you, I believe, and has known your father for\nmany years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is so. And I am almost sure that I must be talking to Miss\nLorraine, the daughter of Sir Roland Lorraine, whom my father has often\nwished to know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. And perhaps you know my brother, who has served in the Peninsula,\nand is now lying very ill at home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very sorry indeed to hear that of him. I know him of course, by\nreputation, as the hero of Badajos; but I think I was ordered across\nthe Atlantic before he joined; or, at any rate, I never met him that I\nknow of--though I shall hope to do so soon. May I see you across this\nlonely hill? Having frightened you so, I may claim the right to prevent\nany others from doing it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlice would have declined the escort of any other stranger; but she had\nheard such noble stories of this Major Aylmer, and felt such pity for a\nbrave career baffled by its own bravery (which in some degree resembled\nher poor brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortunes), that she gave him one of her soft bright\nsmiles, such a smile as he never had received before. Therefore he set\ndown his broad sketch-book, and case of pencils, and went to the rim of\nthe Ring that looks towards the vale of Sussex; and there he shouted,\nto countermand the groom who had been waiting for him at the farm-house\nfar below.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am ordered to ride about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as he returned to Alice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand be\nout of doors all day--a very pleasant medicine. And so, for something\nto do, I have taken up my old trick of drawing; because I must not\nfollow hounds. I would not talk so about myself, except to show you how\nit was that you did not hear me moving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow soon it gets dark on the top of these hills!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice, most\nunscientifically; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI always believe that they feel it sooner, because\nthey see the sun go down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat seems to me to be a fine idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joyce Aylmer answered faithfully.\nAnd his mind was in a loose condition of reason all the way to Coombe\nLorraine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nCOURTLY MANNERS.\n\n\nSir Remnant Chapman, in his dry old fashion, was a strongly-determined\nman. He knew the bitter strait of Coombe Lorraine for ready money;\nand from his father, Sir Barker Chapman (a notorious usurer), he had\ninherited the gift of spinning a disc into a globe. But, like most of\nthe men who labour thus to turn their guineas, he could be very liberal\nwith them for the advancement of his family. And though the Chapmans\nhad gradually acquired such a length of rent-roll, their pedigree\nwas comparatively short among their Norman neighbours. Nothing would\ncure that local defect more speedily and permanently than a wedlock\nwith Lorraine; and father and son were now eager tenfold, by reason\nof Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illness. They had made up their minds that he must die\nwithin a few months; and then Alice, of course, would be the heiress of\nCoombe Lorraine. But the marriage must be accomplished first before the\nmourning stopped it. Then Hilary would drop out of the way; and after\nSir Roland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time was passed, and the properties had been united, there\nought not to be any very great trouble, with plenty of money to back\nthe claim, in awakening the dormant earldom of Lorraine, and enhancing\nits glory with a Chapman.\n\nTo secure all this success at once, they set forth in their yellow\ncoach, one fine November morning. They knew that Sir Roland was\nfretting and pining (although too proud to speak of it) at his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndisgrace, and the crippled and fettered fortunes of the family. Even\napart from poor Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illness, and perhaps fatal despondency, the\nhead of the house of Lorraine would have felt (with his ancient pride\nand chivalry) that a stain must lie on his name until the money was\nmade good again. And now the last who could prolong male heritage\nunbroken--of which the Lorraines were especially proud--was likely to\ngo to a world that does not heed direct succession--except from the\nsinful Adam--for the want of \u00c2\u00a350,000.\n\nCut, and clipped, and cleft with fissures of adjacent owners, the\nonce broad lands of Lorraine were now reduced, for the good of the\nneighbours. But even in those evil days, when long war had lowered\neverything, the residue of the estates would have been for that sum\ngood security, being worth about twice the money. This, however, was\nof no avail; because, by the deed of settlement (made in the time of\nthe late Sir Roger, under the Lady Valeria), nothing could be bound,\nbeyond life-interest, while Alice was living, and under age. This point\nhad been settled hopelessly, by reference to the highest and deepest\nlegal authority of the age, Sir Glanvil Malahide, K.C. Sir Glanvil\nwas not all the man to stultify his own doings. He had been instructed\nto tie tight; and he was pleased to show now how tight he had tied,\nafter his own remonstrance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am of opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote this great lawyer\n(after drawing his pen through the endorsement of a fifty-guinea fee\non the case), \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat under the indentures of Lease and Release, dated\nAug. 5th and 6th, 1799, the estates comprised therein are assured\nto uses precluding any possibility of valid title being made, until\nAlice Lorraine is of age, or deceased.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was a good deal more, of\ncourse; but that was the gist of the matter.\n\nHaving learned from the Rector how these things stood, the captain\ndevised a clever stroke, by which he could render the escape of Alice\nalmost an impossibility. For by this contrivance he could make Sir\nRoland most desirous of the match, who up to the present, though\nwell aware of the many substantial advantages offered, had always\nlistened to his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleading, and promised not to hurry her.\nThe captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan was very simple, as all great ideas are; the honour\nof the family was to be redeemed by the sacrifice of Alice. For, among\nother points, it had been arranged upon the treaty of marriage, that\n\u00c2\u00a350,000 should be settled on Alice, for her separate use, with the\nusual powers of appointment.\n\nNow the captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excellent idea was, that on his wedding-day, this\nsum should be paid in hard cash to Sir Roland and Hilary, as trustees\nfor Alice; and they, by deed of even date, should charge that sum on\nthe Lorraine estate--\u00e2\u0080\u009c_valeat quantum_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the lawyers say; for they\ncould only bind their own interests. The solicitors would be directed\nto waive the obvious objections, which might lead to mischief, or might\nnot, according to circumstances. Thus the flaw of title, which would be\nfatal to any cold-blooded mortgage, might well be turned to good use,\nwhen stopped by a snug little family arrangement.\n\nSir Remnant, with inherited instinct, saw the blot of this conception.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt comes to this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as soon as ever he was told of it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\nyou get the Lorraine property saddled with a loss of \u00c2\u00a350,000, which has\ngone to the scoundrelly Government! The Government rob us all they can.\nIn a sensible point of view, young Lorraine is the first sensible man\nof his family. He has stolen \u00c2\u00a350,000, which the Government stole from\nus tax-payers. As for paying it back again--an idiot might think of it!\nIt makes me kick; and that always hurts me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNevertheless, he was brought round (when he had kicked his passion\nout), as most of the obstinate old men are, to the plans and aims of\nthe younger ones. Steenie was a fool--they all were fools--there was\nscarcely any sense left in anybody but himself, and the boy who stole\nall that money, and was dying for fear of being prosecuted. Sir Remnant\ncould not bring himself to believe a word of the story, except as\nhimself had shaped it. Thus he worked himself up, with his want of\nfaith, to believe that poor Hilary had got the money buried somewhere\non the Downs, and would dig it up like a morel, as soon as the stir of\nthe moment was over. If so, there could be no loss after all; only it\nwould have been very much better to make no fuss about the money stolen.\n\nRevolving these things in his mind, and regretting the good old times\nwhen any one (if at all in a good position) might have stolen \u00c2\u00a350,000\nwithout any trumpery scandal, this baronet of the fine old school\nprepared to listen, in a quiet way, to any plans that would come home\nagain. And he thought that this plan of his son would do so, either in\nmoney or in kind. Yet having formed some misty sketch of the character\nof Sir Roland, each of these Chapmans wished the other to begin the\noverture.\n\nIt would have been pleasant for anybody quite outside of danger, to\nwatch the great yellow coach of the captain labouring up the chalky\nroad, the best approach to Coombe Lorraine, now that the Steyning road\nwas stopped, for all who could not walk a tree, by the outburst of the\nwater. All the roads were drenched just now; and wet chalk is a most\nslippery thing, especially when it has taken blue stripes from the\nrubbing of soft iron, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrag\u00e2\u0080\u009d of some heavy waggon sliding down the\nsteep with a clank and jerk. Sir Remnant had very little faith in his\nson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most expensive gift of driving; and he jerked out his bad head\nat every corner in anxiety for his good body and soul. The wicked,\nhowever, are protected always; and thus this venturesome baronet was\nfetched out of his coach, with much applause, and a little touch of\ngout about him, such as he would not stop to groan at.\n\nSir Roland Lorraine was not glad to see them, and did not feign to be\nso. He wanted to be left alone just now, with such a number of things\nto think of. He perceived that they were come to hurry him about a\nthing he was not ripe with. Knowing his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steadfast nature,\nand his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stubborn stuff, in the calm of his heart he had\nhoped good things. To balance one against the other in psychological\ncounterpoise--as all good English writers of the present day express\nit--or, as our rude granddads said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto let them fight it out between\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOver your books again, Lorraine? Well, well, I can understand all\nthat. I was pretty nigh taking to such things myself, after I put my\nknee-cap out. Steenie is a wonderful scholar now. I believe a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 can\nconstrue Homer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat depends on the mood I am in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the captain, modestly;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009csometimes I can make out a very nice piece.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that is more than any man can say in the county, that I know\nof. Except, of course, one or two new parsons, and Sir Roland here,\nand some ragamuffins that come about teaching their stuff in lodgings.\nLorraine now, after all, how are you? How do you get through these bad\ntimes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland Lorraine, for the third time now, shook hands with Sir\nRemnant Chapman. Not from any outburst of hospitality on his part, but\nbecause the other would have it so. A strong opinion had newly set\nin, that all good Britons were bound to shake hands; that dirty and\ncold-blooded Frenchmen bowed at a distance homicidally; and therefore\nthat wholesome Englishman must squeeze one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knuckles to the\nutmost. And that idea is not yet extinct.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how is her ladyship?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Sir Remnant, striking his gold-headed\nstick on the floor very firmly at the mere thought of her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you\nthink she will see her most humble servant? Gadzooks, sir, she is of\nthe true old sort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was amused the last time you were here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland answered\nsmiling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto find how thoroughly you and my mother seemed to understand\neach other. I am sure that if she is well enough to see anybody, she\nwill see you. Meanwhile, will you take something?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow that is not the way to put it. Of course I will take something. I\nlike to see the glasses all brought in, and then the cupboards opened\nand then the young women all going about, with hot and cold water, and\nsugar-tongs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will try to do those little things aright,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the host answered very\nquietly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cby the time of your reappearance. Trotman is come to say that\nmy mother will do herself the honour of receiving you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSteenie, you stop here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted Sir Remnant, getting up briskly and\nsetting his eyebrows, eyes, and knees for business. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSteenie, you are a\nboy yet, and Court ladies prefer the society of men. No, no; I can pick\nup my cane myself. Just you sit down quietly, Steenie, and entertain\nSir Roland till I come back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Remnant, though somewhat of a bear by nature, prided himself on\nhis courtly manners, when occasion called for them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGadzooks, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe used to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnurse my vittels, if I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make a leg with the very\nbest of them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he carried his stick in a manner to prove that he\nmust have kissed hands, or toes, or something.\n\nEntering Lady Valeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drawing-room in his daintiest manner, the old\nreprobate (as he called himself, sometimes with pride, and sometimes\nwith terror, according as his spirits were up or down) made a slow and\ndeep obeisance, then kissed the tips of his fingers, and waved them,\nand, seeing a smile on the lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, ventured to lay his poor hand\non his heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Sir Remnant, you are too gallant!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, who in good\ntruth despised him, and hated him also as the owner of great broad\nstripes of the land of Lorraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe never get such manners now; never\nsince the Court was broken up: and things that it would not become me\nat all to hint at are encouraged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, my lady; you are right all over. Gadzooks--ahem, I beg\nyour ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pardon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy no means, Sir Remnant. The gentlemen always, in the best society,\nwere allowed to say those little things. And I missed them sadly when I\ncame down here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam, my admiration of you increases with every word you speak. From\nwhat I hear of the mock-Court now (as you and I might call it), and\nmy son has been hand-in-glove for years with the P.R., indeed, the\nwhole number of their Royal Highnesses,--in short, I cannot tell your\nladyship--things are very bad, very bad indeed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Sir Remnant made a\ngrimace, as if his own whole life had been purity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear that is too true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the lady answered, looking straight at him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe find things always growing worse, as we ourselves grow wiser.\nBut come now, and sit in this chair, and tell me, if you please, Sir\nRemnant, how the poor things are getting on--your captain and my poor\ngrandchild.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, madam, I need not tell a lady of your high breeding and\nexperience; the maids of the present day are not at all the same thing\nas they used to be. But, thank the Lord, they get on, on the whole as\nwell as can be expected. But Sir Roland will not help us; and the young\nmaid flies and flickers, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to come to know her own mind.\nYou know, my lady, the Lord in heaven scarce knows what to make of\nthem. They will have this, and they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that; and they hates to\nlook at anything but their swinging-glasses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, sir, you have not been at court for nothing. You have come to a\nvery sad view of the ladies. But they deserve a great deal more than\nthat. If you were to hear what even I, at this great distance, know of\nthem--but I will say no more; it is always best, and charitable, not to\nspeak of them. So let us go back, if you please, Sir Remnant; I have my\nown ways of considering things. Indeed, I am obliged to have them, in a\nmanner now scarcely understood. But, I hear a noise--is it a mouse, or\na rat, do you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was neither mouse nor rat; as Lady Valeria knew quite well. It was\nsimply poor Sir Remnant tapping on the floor with his walking-stick;\nwhich of course he had no right to do, while the lady was addressing\nhim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt sounds like a very little mouse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor perhaps it was the\ndeath-tick. It often comes in these old rooms, when any of the people\nare going to die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old gentleman had not been at Court for nothing (as the old lady\nhad told him); he knew how timid and superstitious were the brave women\nof the fine old time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, sir, are you sure that you never made a tap?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Lady Valeria,\nanxiously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a quarter of a tap, as I hope to be saved,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old reprobate\nanswered, below his breath; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI pay no heed to nonsense; but a thing of\nthis sort must mean something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere have been a great many signs of late,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old lady, after\nlistening with her keener ear brought round, and the misty lace of her\nbeautiful cap quivering like a spider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s web: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere seems to have been\na great many signs of bad things coming, in their proper time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will come before we are ready, madam; old Scratch waits for no\ninvitation. But they say that the death-tick runs before him, and keeps\ntime with his cloven heel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Lord, Sir Remnant, how dreadfully you talk! I beg you to spare\nme; I have had no sleep since I was told of that horrible water, and\nof my poor grandson. Poor Hilary! He has done great things, and spent\nno money of his own; and indeed he had none of his own to spend; and\nhaving denied himself so, is it right that he should be disgraced and\nbreak his heart, because he could not help losing a little money, that\nwas not at all his own? And he had taken a town worth ten times as\nmuch; now, truly speaking, is it fair of them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly not, madam; pox upon them! It is the scurviest thing ever\nheard of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you must remember, sir, if you please, that from his childhood\nupward, indeed ever since he could move on two legs, he always lost\nevery sixpence put by kind people into his pockets. I gave him a guinea\non his very fifth birthday; and in the afternoon what do you think\nhe showed me? A filthy old tobacco-pipe, and nothing else--no change\nwhatever. And his pride was more than he could set forth; though he\nalways was a chatterer. Now, if such a thing as that could only be\nproperly put at the Horse Guards, by some one of good position, surely,\nSir Remnant, they would make allowance; they would see that it was his\nnature; at least they would have done so in my time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course they would, of course, my lady. But things have been\ngrowing, from year to year, to such a pitch of\u00e2\u0080\u009d--here Sir Remnant\ntook advantage of the lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s courtly indulgence towards bad\nlanguage--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat--that--they seem to want almost--gadzooks, they want to\ntreat men almost all alike?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey never can do that, good sir. They never could be such fools as to\ntry it. And, bad as they may be, they must be aware that my grandson\nhas done no harm to them. Why, the money he lost was not theirs at\nall; it was all for the pay of the common soldiers. It comes out of\neverybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pocket, and it goes into nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. And, to my mind, it\nserves them all perfectly right. Who is that General--I forget his\nname, an Irishman, if I remember aright--who is he, or of what family,\nthat he should put a Lorraine to look after dirty money? The heir of\nall the Lorraines to be put to do a cashier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven save me from such a proud woman as this!\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought poor Sir\nRemnant Chapman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif Alice is like her, the Lord have pity on our\nunlucky Steenie! He won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dare have his nip of brandy, even in a\ncorner!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, poor dear, he is very ill indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the ancient\nlady, recovering from the indignation which had even wrinkled her\nfirm and smooth forehead; \u00e2\u0080\u009che has pledged his honour to make good the\nmoney; and my son also thinks that the dignity of our family demands\nit: though to me it seems quite a ridiculous thing; and you of course\nwill agree with me. And the doctors say that he has something on his\nmind; and if he cannot be relieved of it, he must die, poor boy. And\nthen what becomes of the name of Lorraine that has been here for nearly\neight hundred years?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt becomes extinct, of course, my lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Sir Remnant, as\ncalmly as if the revolution of the earth need not be stopped; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it\nmight be revived in the female line, by royal licence, hereafter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat would be of very little use. Why, even your grandson might be a\nLorraine! Is that what you were thinking of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, no! Of course not, my lady. Nothing could be further from my\nthoughts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The old baronet vainly endeavoured, as he spoke, to meet the\nsuspicious gaze of the lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still penetrating and bright eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not so particular about the spindle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she resumed with some\ncondescension; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut in the sword line we must be represented duly; and\nwe never could be supplanted by a Chapman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGadzooks, madam, are the Chapmans dirt? But in order to show how you\nwrong us, my lady, I will tell you what I am come to propose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHerewith he looked very impressive, and leaned both hands on his stick,\nas if inditing of an excellent matter. And thus he set forth his\nscheme, which bore at first sight a fair and magnanimous face; as if\nall that large sum of money were given, or without security trusted,\nfor no other purpose, except to save a life precious to both families.\nThe old lady listened with prudent reserve, yet an inward sense of\nrelief, and even a faint suspicious gratitude. She was too old now\nto digest very freely any generous sentiment. Blessed are they who,\ncrossing the limit of human years, can carry with them faith in worn\nhumanity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\nA SAMPLE FROM KENT.\n\n\nOf all trite proverbs, no truer there is in the affairs of men (perhaps\nbecause in the kingdom of the clouds so untrue) than this venerable\nsaying--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt never rains, but what it pours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Chapmans had come,\nwith a storm of cash, to wash away Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obstructions; and now on\nthat very same day there appeared a smaller, but more kindly cloud, to\ndrop its little fatness.\n\nJust when Sir Roland had managed to get rid (at the expense of\npoor Alice perhaps) of that tedious half-born Stephen Chapman, the\nindefatigable Trotman came, with his volatile particles uppermost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf\nyou plaize, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop un at all. He saith as he will\nsee you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if he will, he must, of course. But who is this man of such\nresolute mind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you plaize, sir, I never had seed un from Adam. And I showed un the\nwrong way, to get a little time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen go now, and show him the right way, John. I am always ready to\nsee any one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland knew well that this was not true. He had said it without\nthinking; and, with his pure love of truth, he began to condemn himself\nfor saying it. He knew that he liked no strangers now, nor even any\nordinary friends; and he was always sorry to hear that any one made\ndemand to see him. Before he could repent of his repentance, the door\nwas opened, and in walked a man of moderate stature, sturdy frame,\nand honest, ruddy, and determined face, well shaven betwixt grey\nwhiskers. Sir Roland had never been wont to take much heed of the human\ncountenance; therefore he was surprised to find himself rushing to a\nrash conclusion--\u00e2\u0080\u009can honest man, if ever there was one; also a very\nkind one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Grower came forward, without any sign of humility, awkwardness,\nsense of difference, or that which is lowest of all--intense and\nshallow self-assertion. He knew that he was not of Sir Roland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rank;\nand he had no idea of defying it: he was simply a man, come to speak\nto a man, for the love of those dependent on him, in the largeness\nof humanity. At the same time, he was a little afraid of going too\nfar with anything. He made a bow (by no means graceful, but of a tidy\nEnglish sort, when the back always wants to go back again), and then,\nas true Englishmen generally do, he waited to be spoken to.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you have had trouble in\nfinding me. We generally manage to get on well; but sometimes things go\ncrooked. Will you come and sit down here, and tell me why you came to\nsee me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartin Lovejoy made another bow, of pattern less like a tenterhook. He\nhad come with a will to be roughly received; and lo, there was nothing\nbut smoothness. Full as he was of his errand, and the largest views of\neverything, he had made up his mind to say something fierce; and here\nwas no opportunity. For he took it for granted, in his simple way, that\nSir Roland knew thoroughly well who he was.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am come to see you, Sir Roland Lorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began, with a slightly\nquivering voice, after declining the offered chair; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot to press\nmyself upon you, but only for the sake of my daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the other answered, beginning to suspect; \u00e2\u0080\u009care you then the\nfather of that young lady----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am the father of Mabel Lovejoy. And sorry I should be to be her\nfather, if--if--I mean, sir, if she was anybody else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter. But\nbeing as it is, she is my own dear child; and no man has a better one.\nAnd if any one says that she threw herself at the feet of your son, for\nthe sake of his name, Sir Roland, that man is a liar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy good sir, I know it. I never supposed that your daughter did\nanything of the kind. I have heard that the fault was my son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\naltogether.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen why have you never said a word to say so? Why did you leave\nus like so many dogs, to come when you might whistle? Because we\nare beneath you in the world, is your son to do a great wrong to my\ndaughter, while you sit up here on the top of your hill, as if you had\nnever heard of us? Is this all the honour that comes of high birth?\nThen I thank the Almighty that we are not high born.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Grower struck his ash-stick with disdain upon the rich Turkey\ncarpet, and turned his broad back on Sir Roland Lorraine; not out of\nrudeness (as the latter thought), but to hide the moisture that came\nand spoiled the righteous sparkle of his eyes. The baronet perhaps\nhad never felt so small and self-condemned before. He had not been so\nblind and narrow-minded, as to forget, through the past two years,\nthat every question has two sides. He had often felt that the Kentish\nhomestead had a grievance against the South Down castle; but with\nhis contemplative ease, and hatred of any disturbance, he had left\nthe case mainly to right itself; persuading himself at last that he\nmust have done all that could be expected, in making that promise to\nStruan Hales. But now all the fallacy of such ideas was scattered by a\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honest wrath. And he was not a man who would argue down the\nrights of another; when he saw them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, Mr. Lovejoy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not behaved at\nall well to you. I will make no excuses, but tell you fairly that I am\nsorry for my conduct now that you put it so plainly. And whatever I can\ndo shall be done, to make amends to your daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmends means money, from one rank to another. Would you dare to offer\nme money, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly not; it is the very last thing I ever should dream of doing.\nNot to mention the scarcity of cash just now. In such a case, money is\nan insult.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think so--I should think so. What money would ever pay for\nour Mabel? If you had only seen her once, you could never have been\nangry with your son. Although I was; although I was--until I heard how\nill he is. But bless you, sir, they will do these things--and there is\nno stopping them. It puts one into a passion with them until one begins\nto remember. But now, sir, I have heard all sorts of things. Is it true\nthat Master Hilary lies very ill abed, for want of money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou put it very shortly; but it comes to that. He has lost a large sum\nof the public money, and we cannot very well replace it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you should a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 come to me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cure all that trouble in a\njiffy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Grower, tugging heavily at something well inside his\nwaistcoat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very tidy lump of money; and no call to\nbe ashamed of it, in the way you high folk look at things--because us\nnever made it. Not a farden of it ever saw Covent Garden; all came\nstraight without any trade whatever! He can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lost all that, anyhow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMartin Lovejoy, with broad-tipped fingers, and nails not altogether\nexempt from chewing, was working away, as he spoke, at a bag such as\nwheat is sampled in, and tied with whipcord round the neck. Sir Roland\nLorraine, without saying a word, looked on, and smiled softly with\nquiet surprise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo patience--I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t no patience with counting, since I broke my\nfinger, sir,--seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, no--well, it must be\nright, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reckoned amiss; our Mab reckoned every penny--no longer\nthan yesterday morning--twenty thousand pounds it must be, according\nto the ticket. There is one lot a-missing; oh, here it is, in among my\nfingers, I do believe! What slippery rubbish this bank stuff is! Will\nyou please now to score them all up, Sir Roland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Lovejoy, why should I do that? It cannot matter what the quantity\nis. The meaning is what I am thinking of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell sir, and the meaning is just this. My daughter Mabel hath had a\nfortune left her by her godfather, the famous banker Lightgold, over to\nthe town of Tonbridge. No doubt you have heard of him, Sir Roland, and\nof his death six months agone. Well no, I forget; it is so far away. I\nbe so used to home, that I always speak as if I was at home. And they\nmade me trustee for her--that they did; showing confidence in my nature\nalmost, on the part of the laiyers, sir, do you think? At least I took\nit in that way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was kind of you, so to take it. They have no confidence in\nanybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nature, whenever they can help it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I have heard, sir. I have heard that same, and in my small way\nproved it. But will you be pleased just to count the money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must be worse than the lawyers if I did. Your daughter Mabel must be\nthe best, and kindest-hearted, and most loving----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Grower, as if that point wanted no\nestablishing; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut business is business, Sir Roland Lorraine. I am my\ndaughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trustee, do you see, and bound to be sure that her money\ngoes right. And it is a good bit of money, mind you; more than I could\nearn in all my life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you tell me exactly what she said? I should like to hear her very\nwords. I beg you to sit down. Are you afraid that I shall run off with\nthe trust-funds?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are like your son. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be dashed if you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Excuse me, Sir\nRoland, for making so free--but that was just his way of turning\nthings; a sort of a something in a funny manner, that won the heart\nof my poor maid. None of our people know how to do it; except of\ncourse our Mabel. Mabel can do it, answer for answer, with any that\ncome provoking her. But she hathn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shown the spirit for it, now ever\nsince--the Lord knows what was the name of the town Master Hilary took.\nThat signifies nothing, neither here nor there; only it showeth how\nthey do take on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Mr. Lovejoy, I see all that. But what was it your good daughter\nsaid?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is always saying something, sir--something or other; except now\nand then; when her mind perhaps is too much for it. But about this\nmoney-bag she said--is that what you ask, Sir Roland? Well, sir, what\nshe said was this. They had told me a deal, you must understand, about\ninvesting in good securities, meaning their own blessed pockets, no\ndoubt. But they found me too old a bird for that. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Down with the\nmoney!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says I, the same as John Shorne might in the market. They\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Not a bit of it, till I put another laiyer\nat them--my own son, sir, if you please, a counsellor on our circuit;\nand he brought them to book in no time, and he laid down the law to\nme pretty strong about my being answerable. So as soon as I got it,\nI said to her, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mabel, how am I to lodge it for you, to fetch proper\ninterest, until you come of age?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But the young silly burst out crying,\nand she said--\u00e2\u0080\u0098What good can it ever be to me? Take it all, father,\ntake every penny, and see if it will do any good to him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And no peace\ncould I have, till at last I set off. And there it is, Sir Roland. But\nI am thinking that, the money in no way belonging to me, I am bound\nto ask you to make a receipt, or give me your note of hand for it, or\nsomething as you think proper, just to disappoint the laiyers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall have my receipt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland Lorraine, with his eyes\nbeginning to glisten. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeanwhile place all the money in the bag, and\ntie it up securely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Grower fetched a quiet little sigh, and allowed the corners of\nhis mouth to drop, as he did what he was told to do. It had cost him\nmany a hard fight with Mabel, and many a sulky puff of pipe, to be\nsent on such an errand. Money is money; and a man who makes it with so\nmuch anxiety, chance of season, and cheating from the middlemen, as a\nfruit-grower has to struggle through,--such a man wants to know the\nreason why he should let it go all of a heap. However, Martin Lovejoy\nwas one of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnoblest works of God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an honest man--though an honest\nwoman is even yet more noble, if value goes by rarity--and he knew that\nthe money was his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, to do what she pleased with, in a\ntwelvemonth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, when she would be a spinster of majority.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have written my receipt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland, breaking in on Master\nLovejoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sad retrospect at the bag of money. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRead it, and tell me if\nI have been too cold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt is a thing quite unaccountable, haply (and yet there must be some\ncause for it), that some men who allow no tone of voice, no pressure\nof hand, to betray emotion, yet cannot take pen without doing it, and\nletting the fount of heart break open from the sealed reserve of eye.\nNo other explanation can be offered for this note of hand from Sir\nRoland Lorraine. The Grower put on his specs.; and then he took them\noff, and wiped them; and then, as the shadow of the hill came over, he\nfound it hard to read anything. The truth was that he had read every\nword, but had no idea of being overcome. And the note, so hard to read,\nwas as follows:--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMABEL,\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have done you much injustice. And I hope that I may live\n    long enough to show what now I think of you. Your perfect faith\n    and love are more than any one can have deserved of you, and\n    least of all my son, who has fallen into all his sad distress\n    by wandering away from you. Your money, of course, I cannot\n    accept; but your goodwill I value more than I have power to\n    tell you. If you would come and see Hilary, I think it would do\n    him more good than a hundred doctors. Sometimes he seems pretty\n    well; and again he is fit for little or nothing. I know that he\n    longs to see you, Mabel; and having so wronged you, I ask you\n    humbly to come and let us do you justice.\n\n                                                 \u00e2\u0080\u009cROLAND LORRAINE.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\nA FAMILY ARRANGEMENT.\n\n\nIt did not occur to Sir Roland Lorraine (as he shook Martin Lovejoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhand, and showed him forth on his way to meet the Reigate coach at\nPyecombe) that Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rich legacy might be supposed to have changed\nhis own views concerning her. Whether her portion was to be twenty\nthousand pounds or twenty pence, made very little difference to him;\nbut what made all the difference was the greatness of her faith and\nlove.\n\nThe Grower was a man who judged a man very much by eyesight. He had\nfound out so many rogues, by means of that \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeen Kentish look,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for\nwhich the Sidneys, and some other old families, were famous. And having\nwell applied this to Sir Roland, he had no longer any doubt of him.\nAnd yet, with his shrewd common-sense, he was not sorry to button up\nhis coat with the money once more inside it, in the sample-bag, which\nhad sampled so much love, and trust, and loyalty. Money is not so\nlight to come by as great landlords might suppose; and for a girl to\nbe known to have it is the best of all strings to her bow. So Master\nLovejoy grasped his staff; and it would have been a hard job for even\nthe famous Black Robin, the highwayman of the time, to have wrested the\ntrust-fund from him.\n\nCovering the ground at an active pace, and crossing the Woeburn by\na tree-bridge (rudely set up where the old one had been) he strode\nthrough West Lorraine and Steyning, and over the hills to Pyecombe\ncorner, where he took the Reigate coach; and he slept that night at\nReigate.\n\nMeanwhile the Chapmans gathered their forces for perfect conquest of\nAlice. Father and son had quite agreed that the final stroke of victory\nmight best be made by occupying the commanding fortress Valeria. They\nknew that this stronghold was only too ready, for the sake of the land\nbelow it to surrender at discretion; and the guns thereof being turned\non the castle, the whole must lie at their mercy.\n\nYet there were two points which these besiegers had not the perception\nto value duly and seize to their own advantage. One was the character\nof Sir Roland; the other was the English courage and Norman spirit of\nAlice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is all at our mercy now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they thought; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have only to\nhammer away; and the hammer of gold is too heavy for anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They\ndid not put it so clearly as that--for people of that sort do not put\ntheir views to themselves very clearly; still, if they had looked\ninside their ideas, they would have found them so.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSteenie, let me see him first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Remnant, meeting his son, by\nappointment, at the sun-dial in the eastern walk, which for half the\nyear possessed a sinecure office, and a easy berth even through the\nother half. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSteenie, you will make a muddle; you have been at your\nflask again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, what can I do? That girl is enough to roll anybody over. I\nwish I had never seen her--oh, I wish I had never seen her! She\ndis-dis-dis----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDislikes you, Steenie! She can never do that. Of all I have settled\nwith, none have said it. They are only too fond of you, Steenie; just\nas they were of your father before you. And now you are straight, and\ngoing on so well! After all you have done for the women, Steenie, no\ngirl can dislike you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the very thing I try to think. And I know that it ought to be\nso, if only from proper jealousy. But she never seems to care when I\ntalk of girls; and she looks at me so that I scarcely dare speak. And\nit scarcely makes any difference at all what girls have been in love\nwith me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you had the sense to tell her of any of the royal family?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I did. I mentioned two or three, with good foundation. But\nshe never inquired who they were, and nothing seems to touch her. I\nthink I must give it up, after all. I never cared for any girl before.\nAnd it does seem so hard, after more than a score of them, when one is\nin downright earnest at last, not to be able to get a chance of the\nonly one I ever lov-lov-loved!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSteenie, you are a mere ass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Remnant; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou always are, when\nyou get too much--which you ought to keep for dinner-time. I have\nsettled everything for you upstairs, so that it must come right, if\nonly you can hold your tongue and wait. I have them all under my thumb;\nand nothing but your rotten fuss about the young maid can make us one\nday later. Her time is fixed. And whether she dislikes----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDis-dis-dis--what I meant to say was--despises.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPish, and tush, fiddlemaree! A young girl to despise a man! I had\nbetter marry her myself, I trow, if that is all you are fit for. Now\njust go away; go down the hill; go and see old Hales; go anywhere for a\ncouple of hours, while I see Lorraine. Only first give me your honour\nfor this, that you will not touch one more drop of drink until you come\nback for the dinner-time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are always talking at me about that now. And I have had almost\nless than nothing. And even that drop I should not have had, if Alice\nhad not upset me so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you may have needed it. I will say no more. We will upset her\npretty well, by-and-by, the obstinate, haughty fagot! But, Steenie, you\nwill give me your honour--not another drop, except water. You always\nkeep your honour, Steenie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir, I do; and I will give it. But I must not go near either\nAlice or Hales. She does so upset me that I must have a drop. And\nI defy anybody to call upon Hales without having two or three good\nglasses. Oh, I know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do; and I need not cross that infernal\nblack water to do it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call upon the boy at the bottom of the hill,\nand play at pitch guineas with him. They say that he rolls every night\nin money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, Steenie, go and take a lesson from him. All you do with the\nmoney is to roll it away--ducks and drakes, and dipping yourself. I\nwould not have stuck to this matter so much, except that I know it for\nyour last chance. Your last chance, Steenie, is to have a wife, with\nsense and power to steer you. It is worth all the money we are going to\npay; even if it never come back again; which I will take deuced good\ncare it does. You know you are my son, my boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I suppose I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be anybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s else; you carried on very much as\nI do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when my time is over, Steenie--if you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drunk yourself to\ndeath before me--you will say that you had a good kind father, who\nwould go to the devil to save you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, sir, you were down upon me for having had a sentimental drop.\nBut, I think, I may return the compliment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo down the hill, Steenie--go down the hill. It seems to be all that\nyou are fit for. And do try to put your neckcloth tidy before you come\nback to dinner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Remnant Chapman returned to the house, with a heavy sigh from his\nwithered breast. He had not the goodness in him which is needed to\nunderstand the value of a noble maiden, or even of any good girl, taken\nas against man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s selfishness. But in his little way, he thought of the\nbonds of matrimony as a check upon his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poor rambling life; and he\nknew that a lady was wanted in his house; and his great ambition was\nto see, at last, a legitimate grandson. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he comes of the breed of\nLorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will settle \u00c2\u00a3100,000, the very day he is\nborn, on him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith this in his head, he came back to try his measures with Sir\nRoland. He knew that he must not work at all as he had done with Lady\nValeria; but put it all strictly as a matter of business, with no\nobligation on either side; but as if there were \u00e2\u0080\u009clanded security\u00e2\u0080\u009d for\nthe purchase-money of Alice. And he managed all this so well, that Sir\nRoland, proud and high-minded as he was, saw nothing improper in an\narrangement by which Alice would become an incumbent on the Lorraine\nestates, for the purpose of vindicating the honour of Lorraine, and\nsaving, perhaps, the male heir thereof. Accordingly the matter was\nreferred to the lawyers; who put it in hand, with the understanding\nthat the trustees of the marriage-settlement, receiving an indemnity\nfrom Sir Remnant, would waive all defects, and accept as good a\nmortgage as could be made by deed of even date, to secure the \u00c2\u00a350,000.\n\nSir Roland had long been unwilling to give his favourite Alice to\nsuch a man as Captain Chapman seemed to be. Although, through his own\nretiring and rather unsociable habits, he was not aware of the loose\nunprincipled doings of the fellow, he could not but perceive the want\nof solid stuff about him, of any power for good, or even respectable\npowers of evil. But he first tried to think, and then began to believe,\nthat his daughter would cure these defects, and take a new pride and\ndelight in doing so. He knew what a spirited girl she was; and he\nthought it a likely thing enough, that she would do better with a\nweak, fond husband, than with one of superior mind, who might fail to\nbe polite to her. And he could not help seeing that Steenie was now\nentirely devoted to her. Perpetual snubbings or silent contempt made\nlittle difference to Steenie. He knew that he must win in the end; and\nthen his turn might come perhaps; and in half an hour after his worst\nset-down, he was up again, on the arm of Cognac.\n\nAlice Lorraine, with that gift of waiting for destiny, which the best\nwomen have, allowed the whole thing to go on, as if she perceived there\nwas no hope for it. She made no touching appeals to her father, nor\nfrantic prayers to her grandmother; she let the time slip on and on,\nand the people said what they liked to her. She would give her life for\nher brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, and the honour of the family; but firmly was she\nresolved never to be the wife of Stephen Chapman.\n\nThe more she saw of this man, the more deeply and utterly she despised\nhim. She could not explain to her father, or even herself, why she so\nloathed him. She did not know that it was the native shrinking of the\ngood from evil, of the lofty from the low, the brave from the coward,\nthe clean from the unclean. All this she was too young to think of,\ntoo maidenly to imagine. But she felt perhaps, an unformed thought, an\nunpronounced suggestion, that death was a fitter husband for a pure\ngirl, than a rake-hell.\n\nMeanwhile Hilary, upon whom she waited with unwearying love and\ncare, was beginning to rally from his sad disorder and threatening\ndecline. The doctors, who had shaken their heads about him, now\nbegan to smile, and say that under skilful treatment, youth and good\nconstitution did wonders; that \u00e2\u0080\u009creally they had seldom met with clearer\npremonitory indications of phthisis pulmonalis, complicated by cardiac\nand hypochondriac atony, and aggravated by symptomatic congestion\nof the cerebellum. But proper remedial agents had been instrumental\nin counteracting all organic cachexy, and now all the principles of\nsound hygiene imperatively demanded quietude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In plain English, he\nwas better and must not be worried. Therefore he was not even told of\nthe arrangement about his sister. Alice used to come and sit by his\nbed, or sofa, or easy-chair, as he grew a little stronger, and talk\nlight nonsense to him, as if her heart was above all cloud and care.\nIf he alluded to any trouble, she turned it at once to ridicule; and\nwhen he spoke of his indistinct remembrance of the Woeburn, she made\nhim laugh till his heart grew fat, by her mimicry of Nanny Stilgoe,\nwhom she could do to the very life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow gay you are, Lallie; I never\nsaw such a girl!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, with the gratitude which arises from\nliberated levity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do her with the stick so well! Do her again\nwith the stick, dear Lallie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His mind was a little childish now, from\nlong lassitude of indoor life, which is enough to weaken and depress\nthe finest mind that ever came from heaven, and hankers for sight of\nits birth-place. In a word, Alice Lorraine was bestowing whatever of\nmirth or fun she had left (in the face of the coming conflict), all\nthe liveliness of her life, and revolt of bright youth against misery,\nto make her poor brother laugh a little and begin to look like himself\nagain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\nBETTER THAN THE DOCTORS.\n\n\nHilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s luck was beginning to turn. For in a few days he received a\ngrand addition to his comforts, and wholesome encouragement to get\nwell. For after the Grower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return to his home, and recovery from\nhard Sussex air (which upset him for two days and three nights, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom\nthe want of any fruitiness about it\u00e2\u0080\u009d), a solemn council was called\nand held in the state apartment of Old Applewood farm. There were no\nless than five personages present all ready to entertain and maintain\nfundamentally opposite opinions Mr. Martin Lovejoy, M.G., Mrs. Martin\nLovejoy, Counsellor Gregory Lovejoy (brought down by special retainer),\nMiss Phyllis Catherow, and Lieutenant Charles Lovejoy, R.N. Poor Mabel\nwas not allowed to be present, for fear she should cry and disturb\nstrong minds, and corrode all bright honour with mercy. The Grower\nthought that Master John Shorne, as the London representative of the\nhouse, was entitled to be admitted; but no one else saw it in that\nlight, and so the counsel of a Kentish crust was lost.\n\nThe question before the meeting was--Whether without lese-majesty of\nthe ancient Lovejoy family, and in consistence with maiden dignity, and\nthe laws of Covent Garden, Mabel Lovejoy might accept the invitation\nof Coombe Lorraine. A great deal was said upon either side, but no one\nconvinced or converted, till the master said, \u00e2\u0080\u009d You may all talk as you\nlike; but I will have my own way, mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Lovejoy and Gregory were against accepting anything: a letter\nwritten on the spur of the moment was not the proper overture; neither\nought Mabel to go at last, because they might happen to want her. But\nthe father said, and the sailor also, and sweet Cousin Phyllis, that\nif she was wanted she ought to go, dispensing with small formality;\nespecially if she should want to go.\n\nShe did want to go; and go she did, backed up by kind opinions; and her\nfather being busy with his pears and hops (which were poor and late\nthis wet season), the fine young sailor, now adrift on shore--while his\nship was refitting at Chatham--made sail, with his sister in convoy,\nfor the old roadstead of the South Downs. Gregory (who had refused to\ngo, for reasons best known to himself, but sensible and sound ones)\nwishing them good luck, returned to his chambers in the Middle Temple.\n\nNow there is no time to set forth how these two themselves set forth;\nthe sailor with all the high spirit of the sea, when it overruns the\nland; the spinster inclined to be meditative, tranquil, and deep of eye\nand heart; yet compelled to come out of herself and smile, and then let\nherself come into her smile. It is a way all kind-hearted girls have,\nwhen they know that they ought to be grave, and truly intend to be so,\nyet cannot put a chain on the popgun pellets of young age, health, and\ninnocence.\n\nEnough that they had arrived quite safely at the old house in the\nCoombe, with the sailor of course in a flurry of ambition to navigate\nhis father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horse whenever he looked between his ears. The inborn\nresemblance between ships and horses has been perceived, and must have\nbeen perceived, long before Homer, or even Job, began to consider the\nsubject; and it still holds good, and deserves to be treated by the\nmost eloquent man of the age, retiring into silence.\n\nMr. Hales had claimed the right of introducing his favourite Mabel to\nhis brother-in-law, Sir Roland. For amity now reigned again between\nthe Coombe and the Rectory; the little quarrel of the year before had\nlong since been adjusted, and the parson was as ready to contribute his\nvaluable opinion upon any subject, as he was when we began with him.\nOne might almost say even more so; for the longer a good man lives with\na wife and three daughters to receive the law from him, and a parish to\naccept his divinity, the less hesitation he has in admitting the extent\nof his own capacities. Nevertheless he took very good care to keep out\nof Lady Valeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBless my heart! you look better than ever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector to\nblushing Mabel, as her pretty figure descended into his strong arms, at\nthe great house door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me a kiss. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hearty lass. I shall\nalways insist upon it. What! Trembling lips! That will never do. A\nlittle more Danish courage, if you please. You know I am the Danish\nchampion. And here is the Royal Dane of course; or a Dane in the Royal\nNavy, which does quite as well, or better. Charlie, my boy, I want no\nintroduction. You are a fisherman--that is enough; or too much, if your\nsister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words are true. You can catch trout, when I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir, never, I never should dare. But Mabel always makes me a\nwonder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, perhaps we shall try some day, the Church against the Navy; and\nMabel to bring us the luncheon. Well said, well said! I have made her\nsmile; and that is worth a deal of trying. She remembers the goose,\nand the stuffing, and how she took in the clerk from Sussex. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbelieve she made a bit of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did, I did! How can you say such things? I can make better stuffing\nthan that to-morrow. I was not at all at my best, then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are at your best now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, having purposely moved her\nmettle: \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome in with that colour and those sparkling eyes, and you\nwill conquer every one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to conquer no one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, with female privilege of last\nword; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only came to see poor Hilary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Rector, with the fine gallantry and deference of old-fashioned\ndays, led the beautiful and good girl, and presented her to Sir Roland.\nShe was anxious to put her hair a little back, before being looked at;\nbut the impetuous parson wisely would not let her trim herself. She\ncould not look better than she did; so coy, and soft, and bashful,\nresolved to be by no means timid, but afraid that she could not\ncontrive to be brave.\n\nSir Roland Lorraine came forward gently, and took her hand, and kissed\nher. He felt in his heart that he had been hard upon this very pretty\nmaiden, imputing petty ambition to her; which one glance of her true\ndear eyes disproved to his mind for ever. She was come to see Hilary;\nnothing more. Her whole heart was on Hilary. She had much admiration\nof Sir Roland, as her clear eyes told him. But she had more than\nadmiration for some one on another floor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want to go upstairs, my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland said, with the usual\nbathos of all critical moments; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would like to take off your\nthings, and so on, before you see poor Hilary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course she must touch herself up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat do you\nknow about young women? Roland, where is Mrs. Pipkins?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI told her to be not so very far off; but she is boiling down bullace\nplums, or something, of the highest national importance. We could not\ntell when this dear child would come, or we might have received her\nbetter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I am so glad! You cannot receive me, you could not receive me,\nbetter. And now that you have called me your dear child, I shall always\nlove you. I did not think that you would do it. And I came for nothing\nof the kind. I only came for Hilary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, we quite understand that we are nobodies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Sir Roland,\nsmiling; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall go to him directly. But you must not be frightened\nby his appearance. He has been a good deal knocked about, and fallen\ninto sad trouble; but we all hope that now he is getting better, and\nthe sight of you will be better than a hundred doctors to him. But you\nmust not stay very long, of course, and you must keep him very quiet.\nBut I need not tell you--I see that you have a natural gift of nursing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll who have the gift of cookery have the gift of nursing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed\nMr. Hales, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause \u00e2\u0080\u0098omne majus continet in se minus.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Ah, Roland, you\nthink nothing of my learning. If only you knew how I am pervaded with\nLatin, and with logic!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese elderly gentlemen chattered thus because they were gentlemen.\nThey saw that poor Mabel longed to have their attention withdrawn from\nher; and without showing what they saw, they nicely thus withdrew it.\nThen Alice, having heard of Miss Lovejoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival, came down and was\ngood to her, and their hearts were speedily drawn together by their\ncommon anxiety. Alice thought Mabel the prettiest girl she had ever\nseen anywhere; and Mabel thought Alice the loveliest lady that could\nexist out of a picture.\n\nWhat passed between Mabel and Hilary may better be imagined duly, than\nput into clumsy words.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV.\n\nIMPENDING DARKNESS.\n\n\nThe darkness of the hardest winter of the present century--so far as\nthree-fourths of its span enable us to estimate--was gathering over\nthe South Down hills, and all hills and valleys of England. There may\nhave been severer cold, by fits and starts, before and since; but the\nspecial character of this winter was the consistent low temperature.\nThere may have been some fiercer winters, whose traditions still abide,\nand terrify us beyond the range of test and fair thermometer. But\nwithin the range of trusty records, there has been no frost to equal\nthat which began on Christmas-day, 1813.\n\nSeven weeks it lasted, and then broke up, and then began again, and\nlingered: so that in hilly parts the snow-drifts chilled not only the\nlap of May but the rosy skirt of June. That winter was remarkable, not\nonly for perpetual frost, but for continual snowfall; so that no man\nof the most legal mind could tell when he was trespassing. Hedges and\nditches were all alike, and hollow places made high; and hundreds of\nmen fell into drifts; and some few saved their lives by building frozen\nsnow to roof them, and cuddling their knees and chin together in a\npure white home, having heard the famous and true history of Elizabeth\nWoodcook.\n\nBut now before this style of things set in, in bitter earnest, nobody\non the South Down hills could tell what to make of the weather. For\ntwenty years the shepherds had not seen things look so strange like.\nThere was no telling their marks, or places, or the manners of the\nsheep. A sulky grey mist crawled along the ground even when the sky\nwas clear. In the morning, every blade and point, and every spike of\nattraction, and serrated edge (without any intention of ever sawing\nanything), and drooping sheath of something which had vainly tried to\nripen, and umbellate awning of the stalks that had discharged their\nseed, were, one and all alike, incrusted with a little filmy down.\nSometimes it looked like the cotton-grass that grows in boggy places;\nand sometimes like the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican blight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so common now on apple-trees;\nand sometimes more like gossamer, or the track of flying spiders. The\nshepherds had never seen this before; neither had the sheep--those\nwoolly sages of the weather. The sheep turned up their soft black eyes\nwith wonder towards the heavens,--the heavens where every sheep may\nhope to walk, in the form of a fleecy cloud, when men have had his legs\nof mutton.\n\nIt is needless to say that this long warning (without which no great\nfrost arrives) was wholly neglected by every man. The sheep, the\ncattle, and the pigs foresaw it, and the birds took wing to fly from\nit; the fish of the rivers went into the mud, and the fish of the sea\nto deep water. The slug, and the cockroach, the rat and the wholesome\ntoad, came home to their snuggeries; and every wire-worm and young grub\nbored deeper down than he meant to do. Only the human race straggled\nabout, without any perception of anything.\n\nIn this condition of the gloomy air, and just when frost was hovering\nin the grey clouds before striking, Alice Lorraine came into her\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book-room, on the Christmas-eve. There was no sign of any\nmerry Christmas in the shadowed house, nor any young delighted hands\nto work at decoration. Mabel was gone, after a longer visit than had\never been intended; and Alice (who had sojourned in London, under lofty\nauspices) had not been long enough at home to be sure again that it\nwas her home. Upon her return she had enjoyed the escort of a mighty\nwarrior, no less a hero than Colonel Clumps, the nephew of her hostess.\nThe Colonel had been sadly hacked about, in a skirmish soon after\nVittoria, when pressing too hotly on the French rear-guard. He had lost\nnot only his right arm, but a portion of his one sound leg; and instead\nof saying his prayers every morning, he sat for an hour on the edge of\nhis bed and devoted all his theological knowledge to the execration\nof the clumsy bullet, which could not even select his weak point for\nattack. This choler of his made much against the recovery of what was\nleft of him: and the doctors thought that country air might mitigate\nhis state of mind, and at the same time brace his body, which sadly\nwanted bracing. Therefore it had been arranged that he should go for a\nmonth to Coombe Lorraine, posting all the way, of course, and having\nthe fair Alice to wait on him--which is the usual meaning of escort.\n\nAt the date of this journey, the Colonel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two daughters were still\naway at a boarding-school; but they were to come and spend the\nChristmas with his aunt in London, and then follow their father into\nSussex, and perhaps appear as bridesmaids. Meanwhile their father\nwas making himself a leading power at Coombe Lorraine. He naturally\nentered into strict alliance with his aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend, Lady Valeria,\nand sternly impressed upon everybody the necessity of the impending\nmarriage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat earthly objection can there be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he argued with Mrs.\nPipkins, now Alice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only partisan, except old Mr. Binns, the butler;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ceven if Captain Chapman is rather lazy, and a little too fond of\nhis wine-glass; both points are in her favour, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am. She will manage\nhim like a top, of course. And as for looking up to him, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all\nnonsense. If she did, he would have to look down upon her; and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwhat the women can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear, of course. How would you like it now, Mrs.\nPipkins? Tut, tut, tut, now don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me! I am a little too old to be\ntaken in. I only wish that one of my good daughters had \u00c2\u00a350,000 thrown\nat her, with \u00c2\u00a320,000 a-year to follow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut perhaps, sir, your young ladies is not quite so particular, and\nromantic like, as our poor dear Miss Alice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should hope not. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d romantic them. Bread and water is the thing\nfor young hussies, who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know on which side their bread is\nbuttered. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe a bit of it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all sham and girlish\nmake-believe. In her heart she is as ready as he is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlmost everybody said the same thing; and all the credit the poor girl\ngot for her scorn of a golden niddering, was to be looked upon as a coy\npiece of affectation and thanklessness. All this she was well aware\nof. Evil opinion is a thing to which we are alive at once; though good\nopinion is well content to impress itself on the coffin. Alice (who\notherwise rather liked his stolid and upright nature) thought that\nColonel Clumps had no business to form opinion upon her affairs; or at\nany rate, none to express it. But the Colonel always did form opinions,\nand felt himself bound to express them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI live in this house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, when Alice hinted at some such\nphantasy; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the affairs of this house are my concern. If I am not\nto think about the very things around me, I had better have been cut\nin two, than made into three pieces.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He waved the stalk of his arm,\nand stamped the stump of the foot of his better leg, with such a noise\nand gaze of wrath, that the maiden felt he must be in the right. And\nso perhaps he may have been. At any rate, he got his way as a veteran\ncolonel ought to do.\n\nWith everybody he had his way. Being unable to fight any more, he had\ncome to look so ferocious, and his battered and shattered body so\nfiercely backed up the charge of his aspect, that none without vast\nreserve of courage could help being scattered before him. Even Sir\nRoland Lorraine (so calm, and of an infinitely higher mind), by reason\nperhaps of that, gave way, and let the maimed veteran storm his home.\nBut Alice rebelled against all this.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said on that Christmas-eve, when the house was\nchilled with the coming cold, and the unshedden snow hung over it,\nand every sheep, and cow, and crow, and shivering bird, down to the\nJenny-wren, was hieing in search of shelter; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfather, I have not many\nwords to say to you; but such as they are, may I say them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland Lorraine, being struck by her quite unwonted voice and\nmanner, rose from his chair of meditation, left his thoughts about\nthings which can never be thought out by mankind, and came to meet what\na man should think of foremost--his child, his woman child.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLallie, my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said very gently, and kindly looking at her sad\nwild eyes, whose difference from their natural softness touched him\nwith some terror--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLallie, now what has made you look like this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPapa, I did not mean to look at all out of my usual look. I beg your\npardon, if indeed I do. I know that all such things are very small in\nyour way of regarding things. But still, papa--but still, papa, you\nmight let me say something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave I ever refused you, Alice, the right to say almost everything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; that you have never done, of course. But what I want to say now\nis something more than I generally want to say. Of course, it cannot\nmatter to you, papa; but to me it makes all the difference.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear, you are growing sarcastic. All that matters to you matters a\ngreat deal more to me, of course. You know what you have always been to\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do, papa. And that is why I find it so very hard to believe that you\ncan be now so hard with me. I do not see what I can have done to make\nyou so different to me. Girls like me are fond of saying very impudent\nthings sometimes; and they seem to be taken lightly. But they are not\nforgiven as they are meant. Have I done anything at all to vex you in\nthat way, papa?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can you be so foolish, Lallie? You talk as if I were a girl\nmyself. You never do a thing to vex me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen why do you do a thing to kill me? It must come to that; and\nyou know it must. I am not very good, nor in any way grand, and I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to say what might seem harsh. But, papa, I think I may say\nthis--you will never see me Stephen Chapman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Lallie, it is mainly your own doing. I did not wish to urge it,\nuntil it seemed to become inevitable. You encouraged him so in the\nsummer, that we cannot now draw back honourably.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFather, I encouraged him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. Your grandmother tells me so. I was very busy at that time; and\nyou were away continually. And whenever I wanted you, I always heard\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Miss Alice is with Captain Chapman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow utterly untrue! But, O papa now, you got jealous! Do say that you\ngot jealous; and then I will forgive you everything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear, there is nothing to be jealous of. I thought that you were\ntaking nicely to the plan laid out for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe plan that will lay me out, papa. But will you tell me one thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my dear child, a hundred things; if you will only ask them\nquietly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not making any noise, papa; it is only that my collar touched my\nthroat. But what I want to know is this. If anything should happen to\nme, as they say; if I should drop out of everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way, could the\nmoney be got that you are all so steadfastly set upon getting? Could\nthe honour of the family be set up, and poor Hilary get restored,\nand well, and the Lorraines go on for ever? Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you answer me,\npapa? My question is a very simple one. What I have a right to ask is\nthis--am I, for some inscrutable reason (which I have had nothing to do\nwith), the stumbling-block--the fatal obstacle to the honour and the\nlife of the family?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice, I never knew you talk like this, and I never saw you look so.\nWhy, your cheeks are perfectly burning! Come here, and let me feel\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, papa; they will do very well. But will you just answer my\nquestion? Am I the fatal--am I the deathblow to the honour and life of\nour lineage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSir Roland Lorraine was by no means pleased with this curt mode of\nputting things. He greatly preferred, at his time of life, the rounding\noff and softening of affairs that are too dramatic. He loved his\nbeautiful daughter more than anything else on the face of the earth;\nhe knew how noble her nature was, and he often thought that she took\na more lofty view of the world than human nature in the end would\njustify. But still he must not give way to that.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can scarcely see why you should so disturb\nyourself. There are many things always to be thought of--more than one\nhas time for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, papa; I know all that; and I hate to see you worried. But\nI think that you might try to tell me whether I am right or not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy darling, you are never wrong. Only things appear to you in a\nstronger light than they do to me. Of course, because you are younger\nand get into a hurry about many things that ought to be more dwelt\nupon. It is true that your life is interposed, through the command of\nyour grandmother and the subtlety of the lawyers, between poor Hilary\nand the money that might have been raised to save him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is true, papa; now, is it? I believe every word that you say; but\nI never believe one word of my grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shocking child! Yes, it is true enough. But, after all, it comes\nto nothing. Of the law I know nothing, I am thankful to say; but from\nSir Glanvil Malahide I understand, through some questions which your\ngrandmother laid before him, that the money can only be got--either\nthrough this family arrangement, or else by waiting till you, as a\nspinster attain the age of twenty-one--which would be nearly two years\ntoo late.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, papa, if I were to die?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLallie, why are you so vexatious? If you were to die, the whole of the\nrace might end--so far as I care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father, you say that, to make me love you more than I do already,\nwhich is a hopeless attempt on your part. Now you need not think that I\nam jealous. It is the last thing I could dream of. But ever since Mabel\nLovejoy appeared, I have not been what I used to be; either with you,\nor with Hilary. In the case of poor Hilary, I must of course expect it,\nand put up with it. But I cannot see, for a moment, why I ought to be\ncut out with you, papa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat foolish jealousy, Alice! Shall I tell you why I like and admire\nMabel so much? But as for comparing her with you----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, papa, why do you like and admire her so deeply?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou jealous child, I did not say \u00e2\u0080\u0098deeply.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But I like her, because she\nis so gentle, so glad to do what she is told, so full of self-sacrifice\nand self-devotion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I am harsh, and disobedient, self-seeking, and devoted to self.\nNo doubt she would marry according to order. Though I dreamed that I\nheard of a certain maltster, who had the paternal sanction. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Veni,\nvidi, vici,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 appears to be her motto. Even grandmamma is vanquished by\nher, or by her legacy. She says that she curtseys much better than I\ndo. She is welcome to that distinction. I am not at all sure that the\nprime end and object of woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life is to curtsey. But I see exactly\nhow I am placed. I will never trouble you any more, papa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these words, Alice Lorraine arose, and kissed her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nforehead gently, and turned away, not to worry him with the long sigh\nof expiring hope. She had still three weeks to make up her mind, or\nrather to wait with her mind made up. And three weeks still is a long\nspell of time for the young to anticipate misery.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are quite unlike yourself, my child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland said with perfect\ntruth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou surprise me very much to-day. I am sure that you do not\nmean a quarter of what you are saying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, papa. I do not mean even a tenth part of my\nspitefulness. I will try to be more like Mabel Lovejoy, who really is\nso good and nice. It is quite a mistake to suppose that I could ever be\njealous of her. She is a dear kind-hearted girl, and the very wife for\nHilary. But I think that she differs a little from me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is no matter of opinion, Alice. Mabel differs from you, as widely\nas you differ from your Cousin Cecil. I begin to incline to an old\nopinion (which I came across the other day), that much more variety is\nto be found in the weaker than in the stronger sex. Regard it thus----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExcuse me, father. I have no courage for regarding anything. You can\nlook at things in fifty lights; and I in one shadow only. Good-bye,\ndarling. Perhaps I shall never speak to you again as I have to-night.\nBut I hope you will remember that I meant it for the best.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV.\n\nA FINE CHRISTMAS SERMON.\n\n\nAccording to all the best accounts, that long and heavy frost began\nwith the clearing of the sky upon Christmas-day. At least it was so in\nthe south of England, though probably two or three days earlier in the\nnorthern countries. A great frost always advances slowly, creeping from\nhigher latitudes. If the cold begins in London sooner than it does in\nEdinburgh, it very seldom lasts out the week; and if it comes on with\na violent wind, its time is generally shorter. It does seem strange,\nbut it is quite true, that many people, even well-informed, attribute\nto this severity of cold the destruction of the great French army\nduring its retreat from Moscow, and the ruin of Napoleon. They know\nthe date of the ghastly carnage of the Beresina and elsewhere, which\nhappened more than a year ere this; but they seem to forget that each\nwinter belongs to the opening, and not to the closing, year. Passing\nall such matters, it is enough to say that Christmas-day 1813 was\nunusually bright and pleasant. The lowering sky and chill grey mist of\nthe last three weeks at length had yielded to the gallant assault of\nthe bright-speared sun. That excellent knight was pricking merrily over\nthe range of the South Down hills; his path was strewn with sparkling\ntrinkets from the casket of the clouds; the brisk air moved before him,\nand he was glad to see his way again. But behind him, and before him,\nlay the ambush of the \u00e2\u0080\u009csnow-blink,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to catch him at night, when he\nshould go down, and to stop him of his view in the morning. However,\nfor the time, he looked very well; and as no one had seen him for ever\nso long, every one took him at his own price.\n\nRector Struan Hales was famous for his sermon on Christmas-day. For\nfive-and-twenty years he had made it his grand sermon of the year. He\nstruck no strokes of enthusiasm--which nobody dreamed of doing then,\nexcept the very low Dissenters--still he began with a strong idea\nthat he ought to preach above the average. And he never failed to do\nso--partly through inspiration of other divines, but mainly by summing\nup all the sins of his parish, and then forgiving them.\n\nThe parish listened with apathy to the wisdom and eloquence of great\nmen (who said what they had to say in English--a lost art for nearly\ntwo centuries), and then the parish pricked up all its ears to hear of\nits own doings. The Rector preached the first part of his sermon in a\nsing-song manner, with a good see-saw. But when he came down to his\nparish-bounds, and traced his own people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trespasses, he changed his\nvoice altogether, so that the deafest old sinner could hear him. It\nwas the treat of all the year to know what the parson was down upon;\nand, to be sure, who had done it. Then, being of a charitable kind,\nand loving while he chastened, the Rector always let them go, with a\nblessing which sounded as rich as a grace for everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Christmas\ndinner. Everybody went out of church, happy and contented. They had\nenough to talk about for a week; and they all must have earned the\ngoodwill of the Lord by going to church on a week-day. But the Rector\nalways waited for his two church-wardens to come into the vestry, and\nshake hands, and praise his sermon. And, not to be behindhand, Farmer\nGates and Mr. Bottler (now come from Steyning to West Lorraine, and\nimmediately appointed, in right of the number of pigs killed weekly,\njunior churchwarden)--these two men of excellent presence, and of\naccomplished manners, got in under the vestry arch, and congratulated\nthe Rector.\n\nAlice Lorraine was not at church. Everybody had missed her in her usual\nniche, between the two dark marble records of certain of her ancestors.\nThere she used to sit, and be set off by their fine antiquity; but she\ndid not go to church that day; for her mind was too full of disturbance.\n\nWest Lorraine Church had been honoured, that day, by the attendance\nof several people entitled to as handsome monuments as could be found\ninside it. For instance, there was Sir Remnant Chapman (for whom even\nan epitaph must strain its elastic charity); Stephen, his son--who had\nspent his harm, without having much to show for it; Colonel Clumps, who\nwould rise and fight, if the resurrection restored his legs; a squire\nof high degree (a distant and vague cousin of the true Lorraines),\nwho wanted to know what was going on, having great hopes through the\nWoeburn, but sworn to stick (whatever might happen) to his own surname,\nwhich was \u00e2\u0080\u009cBloggs;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and last, and best of all, Joyce Aylmer, Viscount\nAylmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only son, of a true old English family, but not a very wealthy\none.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA merry Christmas to you all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mr. Hales, as they stood in the\nporch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA merry Christmas, gentlemen! But, my certy, we shall have a\nqueer one. How keen the air is getting!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey all shook hands with the parson, and thanked him, after the good\nold fashion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor his learned and edifying discourse;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and they asked\nwhat he meant about the weather; but he was too deep to tell them. Even\nhe had been wrong upon that matter, and had grown too wise to commit\nhimself. Then Cecil, who followed her father of course, made the proper\ncurtseys, as the men made bows to her; and Major Aylmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horse was\nbrought, and a carriage for the rest of them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you coming with us, Rector? We dine early,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Remnant, with\na hungry squeak. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have another service, can you? God knows,\nyou have done enough for one day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough to satisfy you, at any rate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Rector answered, smiling:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I should have my house about my ears, if I dined outside of it on\na Christmas-day. Plain and wholesome and juicy fare, sir--none of your\nforeign poisons. Well, good-bye, gentlemen; I shall hope to see all of\nyou again to-morrow, if the snow is not too deep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Rector knew that\na very little snow would be quite enough to stop them, on the morning\nof the morrow--the Sunday.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSnow, indeed! No sign of snow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Remnant answered sharply; he had\nan inborn hate of snow, and he wanted to be at home on the Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\nI say, Missie, remember one thing. Tuesday fortnight is the day. Have\nall your fal-lals ready. Blushing bridesmaids--ah! fine creatures! I\nshall claim a score of busses, mind. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you wish it was your own\nturn, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old rogue, with a hearty smack, blew a kiss to Cecil Hales, who\nblushed and shivered, and then tried to smile, for fear of losing her\nlocket; for it had been whispered that Sir Remnant Chapman had ordered\na ten-guinea locket in London for each of the six bridesmaids. So\nchecking the pert reply, which trembled on the tip of her tongue, she\nmade them a pretty curtsey, as they drove away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, did you observe, papa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, as she took her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm,\nbent fully to gossip with him up the street, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow terribly pale Major\nAylmer turned, when he heard about the bridesmaids? I thought he was\ngoing to drop; as they say he used to do, when he first came home from\nAmerica. I am sure I was right, papa; I am sure I was, in what I told\nyou the other day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNonsense, fiddlesticks, romantic flummery! You girls are never content\nwithout rivalry, jealousy, love and despair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may laugh as much as you like; but it makes no difference to me,\npapa. I tell you that Major Aylmer has lost his heart to Alice, a great\ndeal worse than he lost his head in America.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, he must live with no head and no heart. He can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have\nAlice. He has got no money; even if it were possible to change the\nbridegroom at the door of the church.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you what proves it beyond all dispute. You know how that\nwretched little Captain Chapman looks up when he hates any one, and\nthinks he has made a hit of it. There--like that; only I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it,\nuntil I get much uglier. He often does it to me you know. And then he\npatted his wonderful waistcoat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Cecil, what spiteful things girls are! It is quite impossible\nthat he can hate you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am thankful to say that he does, papa; or perhaps you might have\nsold me to him. If ever any girl was sold, Alice is both bought and\nsold. And Sir Roland cannot love her as she used to think, or he\nwould have had nothing to do with it. It must be fearfully bitter for\nher. And to marry a man who is tipsy every night and tremulous every\nmorning. Oh, papa, papa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear you exaggerate horribly. You have always disliked poor\nSteenie; perhaps that is why he looks up to you. We must hope for the\nbest; we must hope for the best. Why, bless my heart, if every man\nwas to have the whole of his doings raked up, I should never want the\nmarriage-register!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, but papa, if we could only manage to change the man, you know!\nThe other is so different; so kind, and noble, and grand, and simple!\nIf any man in all the world is worthy to marry dear Alice, it is Major\nAylmer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe man might be changed; but not the money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector, rather\nshortly; and his daughter knew from the tone of his voice that she must\nquit the subject; the truth being (as she was well aware) that her\nfather was growing a little ashamed of his own share in the business.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI.\n\nCOMING DOWN IN EARNEST.\n\n\nDark weather and dark fortune do not always come together. Indeed, the\nspirit of the British race, and the cheer flowing from high spirit,\nseem to be most forward in the worst conditions of the weather.\nSomething to battle with, something to talk about, something to make\nthe father more than usually welcome, and the hearth more bright and\nwarm to him, and something also which enlarges, by arousing charity,\nand spreads a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interior comfort into general goodwill--bitter\nweather, at the proper season, is not wholly bitterness.\n\nBut when half-a-dozen gentlemen, who care not a fig for one another,\nhate books (as they hated their hornbooks), scorn all indoor pursuits\nbut gambling, gormandising, and drinking, and find little scope for\npursuing these--when a number of these are snowed up together, and\ncannot see out of the windows--to express it daintily, there is likely\nto be much malediction.\n\nAnd this is exactly what fell upon them, for more than a week, at\nCoombe Lorraine. They made a most excellent dinner on Christmas-day,\nabout three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, as they all declared; and, in spite of the\nshortness of the days, they saw their way till the wine came. They\nwere surprised at this, so far as any of them noticed anything; for,\nof course, no glance of the setting sun came near the old house in the\nwinter. And they thought it a sign of fine hunting-weather, and so they\nwent on about it; whereas it was really one of the things scarcely ever\nseen down here, but common in the arctic regions--the catch, and the\nrecast, and the dispersion of all vague light downward, by the dense\ngrey canopy of gathering snow-vapour.\n\nThe snow began about seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, when the influence of the sun was\nlost; and for three days and three nights it snowed, without taking\nor giving breathing-time. It came down without any wind, or unfair\nattempt at drifting. The meaning of the sky was to snow and no more,\nand let the wind wait his time afterwards. There was no such thing as\nany spying between the flakes at any time. The flakes were not so very\nlarge, but they came as close together as the sand pouring down in an\nhour-glass. They never danced up and down, like gnats or motes, as\ncommon snowflakes do, but one on the back of another fell, expecting\nmillions after them. And if any man looked up to see that gravelly\ninfinitude of pelting spots, which swarms all the air in a snowstorm,\nhe might just as well have shut both eyes, before it was done by\nsnowflakes.\n\nAll the visitors, except the Colonel, were to have left on Monday\nmorning, but only one of them durst attempt the trackless waste of\nwhite between the South Down Coombe and their distant homes. For\nalthough no drifting had begun as yet, some forty hours of heavy fall\nhad spread a blinding cover over road and ditch, and bog and bank,\nand none might descry any sign-post, house, tree, or hill, or other\nland-mark, at the distance of a hundred yards, through the snow, still\ncoming down as heavily as ever. Therefore everybody thought Major\nAylmer almost mad, when he ordered his horse for the long ride home in\nthe midst of such terrible weather.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I ought to let you go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his host said, when the horse\ncame round, as white already as a counterpane. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice, where is your\npersuasive voice? Surely you might beg Major Aylmer to see what another\nday will bring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother day will only make it worse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joyce Aylmer replied, with a\nglance at Alice, which she perfectly understood. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI might be snowed up\nfor a week, Sir Roland, with my father the whole time fidgeting. And\nafter all, what is this compared to the storms we had in America?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, but you were much stronger then. You would not be here, were it\nnot so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI scarcely know. I shall soon rejoin if I get on so famously as this.\nBut I am keeping you in the cold so long, and Miss Lorraine in a chilly\ndraught. Good-bye once more. Can I leave any message for you at the\nRectory?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn another second the thick snow hid him and his floundering horse,\nas they headed towards the borstall, for as yet there was only a\nfootbridge thrown over the course of the Woeburn, and horsemen or\ncarriages northward bound were obliged to go southward first, and then\nturn to the right on the high land, and thus circumvent the stream;\neven as Alice quickly thinking, had enabled poor Bonny to recover his\nJack.\n\nAlice went back, with a sigh, to her own little room to sit and think\nawhile. She knew that she had seen the last of a man whom she could\nwell have loved, and who loved her (as she knew somehow) much too well\nalready. Feeling that this could do no good, but only harm to both of\nthem, he had made up his mind to go, ere any mischief should arise\nfrom it. He had no idea how vastly Alice scorned poor Steenie Chapman,\notherwise even his duty to his host might perhaps have failed him.\nHowever, he had acted wisely, and she would think no more of him.\n\nThis resolution was hard to keep, when she heard a little later in the\nday, that the Major had sent back his groom after making believe to\ntake him. The groom brought a message from his master, begging quarters\nfor a day or two, on the plea that his horse had broken down; but Alice\nfelt sure that he had been sent back, because Major Aylmer would not\nexpose him to the risk which he meant himself to face. For she knew it\nto be more than twenty miles (having studied the map on the subject)\nfrom Coombe Lorraine to Stoke-Aylmer. And ill in the teeth of a bitter\nwind, now just beginning to crawl and wail, as only a snowy wind can do.\n\nThe rest of the gentlemen plagued the house. It was hard to say which\nwas the worst of them--Sir Remnant (who went to the lower regions to\nmake the acquaintance of the kitchen-maids), or Colonel Clumps (who sat\non a sideboard, and fought all his battles over again with a park of\nprofane artillery), or Squire Bloggs (who bit his nails, and heavily\ndemanded beer all day), or Steenie, who scorned beer altogether, and\nbeing repulsed by Onesimus Binns, at last got into Trotman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cstudy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nand ordered some bottles up, and got on well. He sent for his groom,\nand he sent for his horn (which he had not wind enough to blow), and\naltogether he carried on so with a greasy pack of cards and a dozen\ngrimy tumblers, that while the women, being strictly sober, looked down\non his affability, the men said they had known much worse.\n\nFor a week Sir Roland Lorraine was compelled to endure this wearing\nworry--tenfold wearisome as it was to a man of his peculiar nature. He\nhad always been shy of inviting guests; but when they were once inside\nhis door the hospitality of his race and position revived within him.\nAll in the house was at their service, including the master himself, so\nfar as old habits can be varied, but now he was almost like the whelk\nthat admits the little crab for company, and is no more the master of\nhis own door. No man in all England longed that the roads might look\nlike roads again more heartily and sadly than the hospitable Sir Roland.\n\nWith brooms of every sort and shape, and shovels, and even pickaxes,\nall the neighbourhood turned out, as soon as ever a man could manage to\nopen his own cottage-door. For three days it had been no good to try to\ndo anything but look on; but the very first moment the sky left off,\neverybody living under it began to recover courage. The boys came first\nin a joyful manner, sinking over their brace-buttons in the shallow\nplaces, and then the girls came, and were puzzled by the manner of\ntheir dress, till they made up their minds to be boys for a time.\n\nAnd after these came out their mother, for the sake of scolding them;\nand then the father could do no less than stand on his threshold with\npipe in mouth, and look up wisely at the sky, and advise everybody to\nwait a bit. And thus a great many people managed to get out of their\nhouses. And it was observed, not only then, but also for many years to\ncome, how great the mercy of the Lord was. Having seen fit to send such\na storm, he chose for it, not a Wednesday night, nor a Thursday night,\nnor a Friday night, but a Saturday night, when He knew, in His wisdom,\nthat every man had got his wages, and had filled his bread-pan.\n\nAs for the roads, they were blocked entirely against both wheels\nand horses, until a violent wind arose from the east, and winnowed\nfiercely. Sweeping along all the bend of the hill, and swaying the\nladen copses, it tore up the snow in squally spasms, and cast white\nblindness everywhere. Three days the snow had defied the wind, and for\nthree days now the wind had its way. Vexed mortals could do nothing\nmore than shelter themselves in their impotence, and hope, as they\nshivered and sniffed at their pots, that the Lord would repent of His\nanger. It was already perceived, and where people could get together\nthey did not hide it, that Mr. Bottler must go up, and Farmer Gates\ncome down a peg. For, although the sheep were folded well, and mainly\nfetched into the hollows, as soon as the drift began it was known that\nthe very precaution would murder them. For sheep have a foolish trick\nof crowding into the lee of the fold, just where the drift must be the\ndeepest. But pigs are as clever as their mother, dirt--which always\ngets over everything. So Farmer Gates lost three hundred sheep, while\nBottler did not lose a pig, but saved (and exalted the price of) his\nbacon.\n\nWhen the snow, on the wings of the wind, began to pierce the windows\nof Coombe Lorraine (for in such case no putty will keep it out), and\nevery ancient timber creaked with cold disgust of shrinking, and\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrawing\u00e2\u0080\u009d of all the fireplaces was more to the door than the\nchimney, and the chimneys drew submissive moans to the howling of the\ntempest, and chilly rustles and frosty taps sounded outside the walls\nand in--from all these things the young lady of the house gained some\nhope and comfort. Surely in such weather no one could ever think of a\nwedding; nobody could come or go; it would take a week to dig out the\nchurch, and another week to get to it. Blow, blow, thou east wind,\nblow, and bury rather than marry us.\n\nBut the east wind (after three days of blowing, and mixing snow\nof earth and sky) suddenly fell with a hollow sound, like the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cconvolutions of a shell\u00e2\u0080\u009d into deep silence. Clear deep silence settled\non the storm of drifted billows. As the wind left them, so they\nstopped, until the summer rose under them; for spring there was none\nin that terrible year, and no breath of summer until it broke forth.\nAnd now set in the long steadfast frost, which stopped the Thames and\nSevern, the Trent and Tweed, and all the other rivers of Great Britain.\nFrom the source to the mouth a man might cross them without feeling\nwater under him.\n\nAlas for poor Alice! The roads of the weald (being mainly unhedged at\nthat time) were opened as if by \u00e2\u0080\u009cSesame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The hill-roads were choked\nmany fathoms deep wherever they lay in shelter; but the furious wind\nhad swept the flat roads clear, as with a besom.\n\nTheir brown track might be traced for miles, frozen as hard as an\noaken plank, except where a slight depression, or a sudden bend, or a\nfarmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wall, had kept the white wave from shoaling. So, as soon as\na passage had been dug through the borstall, and down the hill to the\nwestward, the Chapmans were free to come and go with their gaudy coach\nas usual.\n\nAlice took this turn of matters with all the calmness of despair. It\nwas nothing but a childish thing to long for a few days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reprieve,\nwhich could not help her much, and might destroy all the good of her\nsacrifice. In one way or the other she must go; standing so terribly\nacross the welfare of all that was dear to her, and seeming (as she\ntold herself) to have no one now to whom she was dear. With no one to\nadvise or aid her, no one even to feel for her, she had to meet the\nsaddest doom that can befall proud woman--wedlock with an object.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII.\n\nTHE LAST CHANCE LOST.\n\n\nAnd now there was but one day left; Monday was come, and on the morrow,\nAlice was to be Mrs. Stephen Chapman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou call yourself an unlucky fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Colonel Clumps to Hilary,\nwho was leaning back in his easy-chair; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I call you the luckiest\ndog in the world. What other man in the British army could have lost\nfifty thousand guineas, escaped court-martial, and had a good furlough,\nmade it all snug with his sweetheart (after gallivanting to his heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncontent), and then got the chance to get back again under Old Beaky,\nand march into Paris? I tell you they will march into Paris, sir. What\nis there to stop them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, Colonel, you forget that I can scarcely march across the room as\nyet. And even if I could, there is much to be done before I get back\nagain. Our fellows may go into winter quarters, and then the General\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npromise drops; or even without that, he may fail with the Duke of York,\nwho loves him not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStuff and rubbish, my dear boy! You pay the money--that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\ngot to do. No fear of their refusing it. Of course it will all be kept\nvery quiet; and we shall find in the very next \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gazette\u00e2\u0080\u0099 some such\nparagraph as this: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Captain Lorraine, of the Headquarter Staff, who has\nlong been absent on sick leave, is now on his way to rejoin, and will\nresume his duties upon the Staff.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome now, Colonel, you are too bad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary, blushing with\npleasure, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey never could put me on the Staff again. It is impossible\nthat they could have the impudence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me. Why, they had the impudence never to put me on it! They\nhave the impudence enough for anything. You set to and get strong, that\nis all. Are you going to your sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wedding to-morrow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you a secret. I mean to go, though I am under strict\norders not to go. What do I care for the weather? Tush, I have settled\nit all very cleverly. You will see me there, when you least expect it.\nLallie has behaved very badly to me; so has everybody else about it. Am\nI never to be told anything? She seems to be in a great hurry about it.\nDesperately in love, no doubt, though from what I remember of Stephen\nChapman I am a little surprised at her taste--but of course----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, of course, one must never say a word about young ladies\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nfancies. There was a young lady in Spain--to be sure there are a great\nmany young ladies in Spain----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Colonel dropped the subject in the clumsiest manner possible. He\nwas under medical orders not to say a word that might stir up Hilary;\nand yet from the time he came into the room he had done nothing else\nbut stir him up. Colonel Clumps was about the last man in the world\nthat ought to stump in at any sick man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDash it, there I\nam again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he used to say, as he began to let out something, and\nstopped short, and jammed his lips up, and set his wooden apparatus\ndown. Therefore he had not been allowed to pay many visits to Hilary,\notherwise the latter must soon have discovered the nature of the\narrangement pending to retrieve his fortunes. At present he thought\nthat the money was to be raised by a simple mortgage, of which he\nvowed, in his sanguine manner, that he would soon relieve the estates,\nby getting an appointment in India, as soon as he had captured Paris.\nMabel of course would go with him, and be a great lady, and make his\ncurries. He was never tired of this idea, and was talking of it to\nColonel Clumps, who had seen some Indian service, when a gentle knock\nat the door was heard, and a soft voice said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I come in?\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Alice\nentered, the battered warrior arose and made a most ingenious bow,\nquite of his own invention. Necessity is the mother of that useful\nbeing; and the Colonel having no leg to stand upon, and only one arm to\nbalance with, was in a position of extreme necessity. Of late he had\nalmost begun to repent of serving under Lady Valeria; the beauty and\ncalm resignation of Alice had made their way into his brave old heart;\nand the more he saw of Captain Chapman, the more he looked down on that\nfeather-bed soldier.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye, my lad. Keep your pecker up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, beginning with\nhis thick bamboo to beat a retreat; for Hilary was not allowed two\nvisitors; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll march into Paris yet, brave boys; with Colonel Clumps\nat the head of the column. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be misled by appearances, Alice;\nthe Colonel has good work in him yet. His sword is only gone to be\nsharpened, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am; and then he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll throw away this d----d bamboo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn his spirited flourish, the Colonel slipped, and not yet being master\nof his wooden leg, and down he must have come, without the young lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\narm, as well as the aid of the slighted staff. Alice, in spite of all\nher misery, could not help a little laugh, as the Colonel, recovering\nhis balance, strutted carefully down the passage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a merry girl you are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Hilary, who was a little vexed\nat having his martial counsel routed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou seem to me to be always\nlaughing when there is nothing to laugh at.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat shows a low sense of humour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor else an excess of\nhigh spirits. Perhaps in my case, the two combine. But I am sorry if I\ndisturbed you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not quite so easily disturbed. I am as well as I ever was. It is\nenough to make one ill, to be coddled up in this kind of way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear brother, you are to be released as soon as the weather\nchanges. At present nobody ventures out who is not going to be married.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf that I can judge from the window, Lallie: and even from my\nwater-jugs. But how is your very grand wedding to be? I have seen a\nscore of men shovelling. You seem to be in such a hurry, dear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps not. Let us talk of something else. Do you really think,\nwithout any nonsense, that all your good repute and welfare depend on\nthe payment of the money which you lost?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can you ask me such a stupid question? I never could lift up my\nhead again--but it is not myself, not at all myself--it is what will\nbe said of the family, Alice. And I do not see how the raising of the\nmoney can interfere at all with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, of course not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, and then she turned away and looked\nout of the window, reflecting that Hilary was right enough. Neither\nloss nor gain of money could long interfere at all with her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye, darling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said at last, forgiving his sick\npetulance, and putting back his curly hair, and kissing his white\nforehead--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye, darling I must not stay; I always seem to excite\nyou so. You will not think me unkind, I am sure; but you may not see\nme again for ever--oh, ever so long; I have so much to do before I am\nready for--my wedding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHilary allowed himself to be kissed with brotherly resignation; and\nthen he called merrily after her--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Lallie, mind, you must look\nyour best. You are going to make a grand match, you know. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be\nastonished if you see me there. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you answer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe would not look round, because of the expression of her face,\nwhich she could not conceal in a moment--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not at all sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe brother wisely, as the sister shut the door and fled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the\nman who marries Alice won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t almost have caught a Tartar. She is very\nsweet-tempered; but the good Lord knows that she is determined also.\nNow Mabel is quite another sort of girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d &c., &c.--reflections which he\nmay be left to reflect.\n\nAlice Lorraine, having none to advise with, and being in her firm\nheart set to do the right thing without flinching, through dark days\nand through weary nights had been striving to make sure what was the\none right thing to do. It was plain that the honour of her race must\nbe saved at her expense. By reason of things she had no hand in, it\nhad come to pass that her poor self stood in everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way. Her poor\nself was full of life, and natural fun, and mind perhaps a little above\nthe average. No other self in the world could find it harder to go\nout of the world; to be a self no more peradventure, but a wandering\nsomething. To lose the sight, and touch, and feeling of the light, and\nlife, and love; not to have the influence even of the weather on them;\nto lie in a hollow place, forgotten, cast aside, and dreaded; never\nmore to have, or wish for, power to say yes or no.\n\nThis was all that lay before her, if she acted truly. As to marrying a\nman she scorned--she must scorn herself ere she thought of it. She knew\nthat she was nothing very great; and her little importance was much\npulled down by the want of any one to love her; but her purity was her\nown inborn right; and nobody should sell or buy it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go to my father once more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she thought; \u00e2\u0080\u009che cannot refuse to\nsee me. I will not threaten. That would be low. But if he cares at all\nto look, he will know from my face what I mean to do. He used, if I had\nthe smallest pain, he used to know it in a moment. But now he cares not\nfor a pain that seems to gnaw my life away. Perhaps it is my own fault.\nPerhaps I have been too proud to put it so. I have put it defiantly,\nand not begged. I will beg, I will beg; on my knees I will beg! I will\ncry, as I never cried before, oh, father, father, father!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPerhaps if she had won this chance, she might even yet have vanquished.\nFor her last reflection was true enough. She had been too defiant, and\npositive in her strength of will towards her father. She had never\ntried the power of tears and prayers, and a pet child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eloquence.\nAnd her father no doubt, had felt this change in her attitude towards\nhim, and had therefore believed more readily his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repeated\nassertions, that nothing stood in the way of a most desirable\narrangement, except the coyness of a spirited girl, whose fancy was not\ntaken.\n\nBut the luckless girl lost all the chances of a last appeal, through\na simple and rather prosaic affair. Her father was not to be found in\nhis book-room; and hurrying on in search of him, she heard the most\nmelancholy drone, almost worse than the sad east wind. Her prophetic\nsoul told her what it was, and that she had a right to be present.\nSo she knocked at the door of a stern, cold room, and being told to\nenter, entered. There she saw seven people sitting, and looking very\nmiserable: for the bitter cold had not been routed by the new-made\nfire. One was reading a tremendous document, five were pretending to\nlisten, and one was listening very keenly. The reader was a lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nclerk; three of the mock-listeners were his principal and the men of\nthe other side; the other two were Sir Roland Lorraine and Captain\nStephen Chapman. The real listener was Sir Remnant, who pricked up\nhis ears at every sentence. Upon the table lay another great deed,\nor rather a double one, lease and release,--the mortgage of all the\nLorraine estates, invalid without her signature, which she was too\nyoung to give.\n\nAlice Lorraine knew what all this meant. It was the charter of her\nslavery, or rather the warrant of her death. She bowed to them all,\nand left the room; with \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the said, and the said--doth hereby, doth\nhereby\u00e2\u0080\u009d--buzzing in her helpless brain.\n\nNow followed a thing which for ever settled and sealed her\ndetermination. Steenie, on the eve of his wedding-day, really felt that\nhe ought to do something towards conciliating his bride. He really\nloved (so far as his nature was capable of honest love) this proud and\nmost lovable maiden, who was to belong to him to-morrow. And his father\nhad said to him, as they came over to go through the legal ceremony,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNurse my vittels, now, Steenie; for God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, try to be a man a bit.\nThe mistake you make with the girl is the way you keep your distance\nfrom her. Why, they draw up their figures, and screw up their mouths,\non purpose to make you run after them. I have seen such a lot of it.\nAnd so have you. All girls are alike; as you ought to know now. Why\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you treat her properly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe unfortunate Steenie took his advice, and he took (which was worse)\na great draught of brandy. And so, when the lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drone had driven\nhim thoroughly out of his patience, at the sight of Alice he slipped\nout and followed her down the passage.\n\nShe despised him too much to run away, as he had hoped that she would\ndo. She heard his weak step, and weaker breath, and stopped, and faced\nhim quietly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\n\nTHE DEATH-BOURNE.\n\n\nStanding in a dark grey corner of the old stone passage, below a faded\nand exiled portrait of some ancestor of hers, Alice looked so calm\nand noble, that Steenie (although he \u00e2\u0080\u009chad his grog on board,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with\nhis daily bill of lading) found it harder than he expected to follow\nhis father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counsel. In twenty-four hours he would have this lovely\ncreature at his mercy; and then he would tame her, and make her love\nhim, and perhaps even try to keep to her. For he really did love this\npoor girl, in a way that quite surprised him; and he could not help\nthinking that if she knew it, by Jove she must be grateful!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice, dear Alice, sweet Alice!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as at every approach she\nshrank further away; \u00e2\u0080\u009clovely Alice, what have I done, that you will not\nyield me one beautiful smile? You know how very well I have behaved. I\nhave not even pleaded for one kiss. And considering all that is between\nus----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cConsidering the distance there is between us, you have shown your\njudgment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do not understand me at all. What I meant was entirely different.\nThere should be no difference between us. Why should there be? Why\nshould there be? In a few hours more we shall both be alike; flesh of\none flesh, and bone of one bone. I am not quite sure that I have got it\nright. But I am not far out at any rate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour diffidence is your one good point. You are very far out when you\novercome it. Have the kindness to keep at a proper distance and hear\nwhat I have to say. I believe that you mean well, Stephen Chapman; so\nfar as you have any meaning left. I believe that you mean well by me;\nand, in your weak manner, like me. But if you had gone all around the\nworld, you could not have found one to suit you less. I used to think\nthat I was humble; as of course I ought to be; but when I search into\nmyself, I find the proudest of the proud. Nothing but great misery\ncould have led me to this knowledge. I speak to you now for the last\ntime, Stephen; and I never meant to speak as I do. But I believe that,\nin your little way, you like me; and I cannot bear to be thought too\nhard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere Alice could not check a sigh and a tear, at the thought of the\nname she might leave behind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat shall I do? What can I do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Stephen, not being such a very\nhard fellow, any more than the rest of us; but feeling himself unworthy\neven to touch her pocket-handkerchief.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have nothing to do, I should hope, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Alice,\nrecovering dignity; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very glad that, whatever happens, you may\nblame other people. Please to remember that I said that. And good-bye,\nCaptain Chapman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye, till dinner-time, my darling--well, then, good-bye, Miss\nLorraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt any rate I am glad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she thought, as she hastened to her room,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat, even to him, I have said my last, as kindly as I could manage\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen she entered her room, it was three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and the day already\nwaning; though the snow from hill and valley, and the rime of quiet\nfrost, spread the flat pervading whiteness of the cold and hazy light.\nAlice looked out, and thought a little; and the scene was by no means\ncheering. The eastern side of the steep straight coombe (up which\nclomb the main road to the house) lay thirty or forty feet deep in\nsnow, being filled by the drift that swept over its crest, for nearly\nthe breadth of the coombe itself. But under the western rampart still\na dark-brown path was open, where the wind, leaping over the eastern\nscarp, had whirled the snow up the western. And here, through her own\npet garden, fell a direct path down to the Woeburn.\n\nShe had long been ready to believe that here her young and lively life\nmust end. Down this steep and narrow way she had gazed, or glanced,\nor peeped (according to the measure of her courage), ever since the\nWoeburn rose, and she was sure what it meant for her. Now looking at\nit, with her mind made up, and her courage steadfast, she could not\nhelp perceiving that she had a great deal to be thankful for. Her life\nhad been very bright and happy, and it had been long enough. She had\nlearned to love all pleasant creatures, and to make them love her. She\nhad found that nature has tenfold more of kindness than of cruelty; and\nthat of her kindness, all the best and dearest ends in death. Painless\ndeath, the honest and peaceful end of earthly things; noble death, that\nsettles all things, scarcely leaving other life (its brief exception)\ntime to mourn.\n\nAll this lay clear and bright before her, now that the golden mist of\nhope was scattered by stern certainty. Many times she had been confused\nby weak desires to escape her duty, and foolish hankerings after things\nthat were but childish trifles. About her bridal dress, for instance,\nshe had been much inclined to think. Of course, she never meant to wear\nit; still, she knew that the London people meant to charge to a long\nextreme; and she thought that she ought to try it on once more, ere\never it was rashly paid for. She truly cared no more than can be helped\nby any woman, whether it set her off or not; but she knew that it must\nbe paid for, and she wanted to know if the Frenchwoman had caught any\nidea of her figure.\n\nTo settle this question, she locked the door, and then very carefully\nchanged her dress. Being the tidiest of the tidy, and as neat as an\nold maid in her habits, she left not a pin, nor a hair on the cloth,\nnor even a brush set crooked. Then being in bridal perfection, and\nas lovely a bride as was ever seen, without one atom of conceit, she\nknew that she was purely beautiful. She stood before the glass, and\nsadly gazed at all her beauty. There she saw the large sweet forehead\n(calm and clear as ever), the deep desire of loving eyes for some one\nto believe in, the bright lips even now relaxing into a sadly playful\nsmile, the oval symmetry of chastened face, in soft relief against\nthe complex curves and waves of rebellious hair. To any man who could\nhave her love, what a pet, what a treasure she might have been, what a\npearl beyond all price--or, as she simply said to herself, what a dear\ngood wife! It was worse than useless to think of that; but, being of\na practical turn of mind, she did not see why she should put on her\nlovely white satin, and let no one see it.\n\nTherefore, she rang for her maid, who stared, and cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, laws,\nMiss! what a booty you do look!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then, of course, wanted to put\nin a pin, and to trim a bow here, and to stroke a plait there; \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is\nwaste of time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice. Then she told her to send Mrs. Pipkins up;\nand the good housekeeper came and kissed her beautiful pet, as she\nalways called her (maintaining the rights of the nursery days), and\nthen began some of the very poor jokes supposed to suit such occasions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPippy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, that the old endearment might cure the pain of the\nsudden check, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must not talk so; I cannot bear it. Now just tell\npapa, not yet, but when dinner is going in, give him this message--say,\nwith my love, that I beg him to excuse me from coming in to dinner,\nbecause I have other things to see to. And mind, Pippy, one thing: I\nhave many arrangements to make before I go away; and if my door should\nbe locked to-night, nobody is to disturb me. I can trust you to see to\nthat, I know. And now say \u00e2\u0080\u0098good-bye\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to me, Pippy dear; I may not see\nyou again, you know. Let me kiss you as I used to do when I was a dear\ngood little child, and used to coax for sugar-plums.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs soon as her kind old friend was gone, Alice made fast her door\nagain, and took off her bridal dress, and put on a plain white frock\nof small value; and then she knelt down at the side of her bed, and\nsaid her usual evening prayers. Although she made no pretence to any\nvehement power of piety, in the depth of heart and mind she nourished\nlove of God, and faith in Him. She believed that He gives us earthly\nlife, to be rendered innocently back to Him, not in cowardly escape\nfrom trouble, but when honour and love demand it. In the ignorance\ncommon to us all, she prayed.\n\nBeing now in a calmer state of mind, she took from her desk a tress of\nlong hair, the most valued of all her treasures. Her long-lost mother;\noh, if only she had a mother to advise her now! She kissed it, and laid\nit in her breast, and then she glided forth to steal one last sad look\nat Hilary. He lay with his back to her, fast asleep, and she kissed him\nlightly, and ran away.\n\nThen, when all the house was quiet, except for the sound of plates and\ndishes (greasily going into deep baskets, one on the head of another),\nAlice Lorraine, having gathered her long hair into a Laconian knot, put\nher favourite garden hat on, and made the tie firm under her firm chin.\nShe looked round her favourite room once more, and nodded farewell to\neverything, and went to seek death with a firmer step than a bride\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ntowards a bridegroom.\n\nAttired in pure white she walked through a scene of bridal beauty.\nEvery tree was overcast with crystal lace and jewellery; common briars\nand ignominious weeds stood up like sceptres; weeping branches shone\nlike plumes of ostrich turned to diamond. And on the ground wave after\nwave of snow-drift, like a stormy tide driven by tempestuous wind, and\nbound in its cresting wrath by frost.\n\nAlthough there was now no breath of wind, Alice knew from the\nglittering whiteness that it must be very cold. She saw her pretty\nbower like a pillow under bed-clothes; and on the clear brown walk she\nscattered crumbs for the poor old robin as soon as he should get up in\nthe morning. And there she saw her favourite rose, a cluster-rose of\nthe softest blush, overcome with trouble now, and the hardness of the\nfreezing world. When the spring should come again, who would there be\nto unroll its grubs, or watch for the invasion of green-fly?\n\nAt this thought, for fear of giving way, she gathered up her dress and\nran. She had no overwhelming sense of fate, necessity, or At\u00c3\u00a9--the\npowers that drove fair maids of Greece to offer themselves for others.\nShe simply desired to do her duty, to save the honour of her race, and\nher pure self from defilement.\n\nThe Woeburn was running as well as ever, quite untouched by any frost,\nand stretched at its length, like a great black leech who puts out its\nhead for suction. Gliding through great piles of snow, it looked sable\nas Cocytus, with long curls of white vapour hovering, where the cold\nair lay on it. The stars were beginning to sparkle now; and a young\nmoon, gazing over Chancton Ring, avouched the calm depth of heaven.\n\nThen Alice came forward, commending her soul to God in good Christian\nmanner, and without a fear, or tear, or sigh, committed her body to the\nDeath-bourne.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX.\n\nBOTTLER BEATS THE ELEMENTS.\n\n\nIt seems to be almost a settled point in the affairs of everybody\n(except, perhaps, Prince Bismarck) that nothing shall come to pass\nexactly according to arrangement. The best and noblest of mankind\ncan do no more than plan discreetly, firmly act, and humbly wait the\npleasure of a just, beneficent, and all-seeing Power.\n\nFor instance, Mr. Bottler had designed for at least three weeks to slay\na large styful of fat pigs. But from day to day he had been forced to\ndefer the operation. The frost was so intense that this good Azrael\nof the grunters had no faith in the efficacy of his ministrations.\nNot indeed as regarded his power to dismiss them to a happier world.\nIn any kind of weather he could stick a pig; the knife they could not\nvery well decline, when skilfully suggested; but they might, and very\noften did, break all the laws of hospitality, by sternly refusing to\naccept his salt. And the object of a pig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creation is triple--(setting\naside his head, and heels, and other small appurtenances)--fresh pork,\npickled pork, and bacon; and the greatest of these three is bacon.\n\nNow what was West Lorraine to do, and even the town of Steyning?\nCart-loads of mutton came into the market, from the death in the snow\nof so many sheep; which (as the general public reasoned) must have made\nthe meat beautifully white; and a great many labourers got a good feed,\nwho had almost forgotten the taste of meat; and it did them good, and\nkept them warm. But the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest families\u00e2\u0080\u009d would not have this: they liked\ntheir mutton to have \u00e2\u0080\u009cinterviewed\u00e2\u0080\u009d the butcher, in a constitutional\nmanner; and not being sure how to prove this point, they would not look\nat any mutton at all, till lamb came out of snow-drift. This being\nso, what was now to be done? Many people said, \u00e2\u0080\u009clive on bread, and so\non, red herrings, and ship-chandler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stores, and whatever else the\nLord may send.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fifty good women came up through the snow to learn the\nRector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion; and all he could say was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoil down your bones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis produced such a desperate run upon the bank of poor Bonny,\nwhich really was a bank--of marrow bones, put by in the summer to\nseason--that Jack was at work almost all the day long, and got\nthoroughly up to the tricks of the snow, and entirely learned how to\ntravel it. Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poor hands were so chapped by the cold, that he\nslurred all the polish of the Rector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boots; and Mr. Hales said that\nhe had better grease them; which cut the boy deeper than any chap.\n\nSuperior people, however, could not think of relying upon Bonny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbones; their money was ready, and they would pay for good meat what it\nwas worth--and no more. Now a thoroughly honest man grows uneasy at\nthe thought of getting more than he ought to get. It is pleasant to\ncheat the public; but the pleasure soaks down through the conscience,\nleaving tuberculous affection there, or bacteria; or at any rate some\nmicroscopic affliction. Bottler felt all these visitations; and in\nspite of all demand, he could not bring himself to do any more than\ntreble the price of pig-meat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does weigh so light this weather! Only take it in your hand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe was bound to tell everybody, for their own sakes; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow you might\nscarcely think it--but what with one thing and another, that pig\nhave cost me two and threepence a pound, and I sell him at one and\nninepence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Mr. Bottler, what a shame of you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, as you stand there, my dear! You might not believe it, from any\none but me; till you marry, and go into business. Ah, and a very bad\nbusiness it is. Starvation to everybody, unless they was bred and born\nto it; and even then only a crust of bread!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Churchwarden Bottler,\nhowever, did not look at all as if he sustained existence on a crust\nof bread. His stockings, whiter than the snow-drifts round him, showed\nvery substantial bulge of leg, and his blue baize apron did like duty\nfor that part of the human being which is so fatal to the race of pigs.\nAnd the soft smile, without which he never spoke, arose and subsided in\nno gaunt cheeks, and flickered in the channels of no paltry chin. In a\nword, Mr. Bottler was quite fat enough to kill.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPolly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to his favourite child, as soon as he had finished\nhis Monday dinner; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have been a good child through this very\nbad weather; and dad means to give you a rare treat to-night. Not\nconsarning the easing of the pigs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, in answer to her\nusual nod, and employing his regular euphemism;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere will be a many\npigs to be eased, to satisfy the neighbourhood, and shut off the rogue\nto Bramber. But you shall see, Polly; you shall see something as will\nastonish you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBottler put on his brown leathern apron, and gently performed his\nspiriting.\n\nAnd without any nonsense, Polly saw a lovely scene soon afterwards.\nFor her father had made up his mind to do a thing which would greatly\nexalt his renown, and quench that little rogue at Bramber. In spite of\nthe weather he would kill pigs; and in spite of the weather, he would\npickle them. He had five nice porkers and four bacon pigs, as ready as\npigs can be for killing. They seemed to him daily to reproach him for\ntheir unduly prolonged existence. They could not lay on any fat in this\nweather, but relapsed for want of carving.\n\nFor Bottler in the morning had done this--which could not have\noccurred to any but a very superior mind. In his new premises facing\nthe lane, a short way below Nanny Stilgoe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cottage, he had a little\nyard, well away from all thatch, and abutting on nothing but his\nscalding-house. This yard was square, and enclosed by a wall of the\nchalky flints, that break so black, and bind so well into mortar.\n\nOf course the whole place was still snowed up; but Master Bottler\nsoon cured that. He went to the parish school, which was to have\nopened after the Christmas holidays on this 10th of January; but the\nschoolmaster vowed that, in such weather, he would warm no boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\neducational part, unless the parish first warmed his own. And the\nparish replied that he might do that for himself; not a knob of coal\nshould he have; it was quite beginning at the wrong end, to warm him\nfirst. His answer was to bolt the school door, and sit down with a pipe\nand a little kettle.\n\nThe circumspect churchwarden had anticipated this state of siege; for\nhe knew that every boy in the parish (who would have run like the devil\nif the door was open), knowing the door to be bolted, would spend the\nwhole day in kicking at it. And here he found them, Bonny at the head,\nas a boy of rising intellect, and Captain Dick of the Bible-corps,\nand the boy who had been shot in the hedge, and many other less\ndistinguished boys, furiously raging together because robbed of their\nright to a flogging.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome along, my lads,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bottler, knowing how to manage boys; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nmay kick all day, and wear out your shoes. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a job for fifty of\nyou, and a penny apiece for all as works well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNot to be too long, these boys all followed Churchwarden Bottler; and\nhe led them to his little yard, and there he fitted every one of them\nup with something or other to work with. Some had brooms, and some had\nshovels, some had spades, and some had mops, one or two worked with old\nfrying-pans, and Bonny had a worn-out warming-pan. All the boys who\nhad got into breeches were to have twopence apiece; and the rest, who\nwere still stitched up at the middle, might earn a penny a head if they\nworked hard.\n\nNot one of them shirked his work. They worked as boys alone ever do\nwork, throwing all their activity into it. And taking the big with the\nlittle ones, it cost Mr. Bottler four shillings and fourpence to get\nsome hundred cubic yards of snow cleared out so thoroughly, that if\na boy wanted to pelt a boy, he must go outside for his snowball. Mr.\nBottler smiled calmly as he paid them; well he knew what an area of\nhunger he was spreading for his good pork, by means of this army of\nworkboys. Then he showed the boys the pigs still living, and patted\ntheir shoulders, and smacked his lips with a relish that found an echo\nat more than forty hearths that evening. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they come up rare?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy and go down rarer still,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Bonny, already beginning\nto stand in high esteem for jocosity, which he did his very best to\nearn.\n\nAll boys other than Bonny departed with lips overflowing with love\nof pork into little icicles. Then Mr. Bottler went to his cart-shed,\nand came back with his largest tarpaulin. He spread and fixed this\nin a clever manner over the middle of his little yard, leaving about\nten feet clear all round between the edge of it and the wall. This\nbeing done, he invited Bonny to dinner, and enjoyed his converse, and\nafterwards pledged himself to Polly, as heretofore recorded. Later\nin the day many squeaks were heard; while Bonny worked hard at the\nfurze-rick.\n\nAll things are judged always by their results. Be it enough, then, to\nchronicle these. West Lorraine, Wiston, and Steyning itself pronounced\nwith one voice on the following day that a thing had been done on the\nbank of the Woeburn that verily vanquished the Woeburn itself. As\nHercules conquered the Achelo\u00c3\u00bcs, and the great Pelides hacked up by\nthe roots both Simois and Scamander, so Bottler (a greater hero than\neven Nestor himself could call to mind, to snub inferior pig-stickers),\nBottler aroused his valour, and scotched, and slew that Python--the\nWoeburn.\n\nIt is not enough to speak of such doings in this casual sort of way.\nBottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deeds are now passing into the era of romance, which always\nprecedes the age of history. Out of romance they all emerge with a\ntail of attestation; and if anybody lays hold of this, and clearly\nsees what to do with it, his story becomes history, and himself a\ngreat historian. But lo, here are the data for any historian of duly\ncombative enthusiasm, to work out what Bottler did.\n\nHe let Bonny work--as all heroes permit--a great deal harder than he\nworked himself. He calmly looked on and smoked his pipe; and knowing\nquite well how the pigs would act (according to bulk and constitution)\nin the question of cooling down, he kept his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watch in hand,\nand at proper periods eased them. Meanwhile Bonny laboured for his\nlife, and by the time all the pigs were ready for posthumous toilet,\ntheir dressing-room was warm and waiting for them. A porker may come\nhome to his positive degree--pork--in less than no time. But the value\nof his dedication of himself--in the manner of a young curate--to the\nservice of humanity, depends very much upon how he is treated.\n\nThe pork-trade at this time of writing is so active, that\neverybody--however small his operations are--should strive to give it\na wholesome check rather than further impetus. And for that reason the\ndoings of Bottler--fully as they deserve description--shall not have a\nbit of it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX.\n\nOH, HARO! HARO! HARO!\n\n\nAgain, another thing will show how heavily and wearily all people that\non earth do dwell plod and plead their little way, and are but where\nthey came from. Three young people, all well wrapped up, and ready to\nface anything, set out from Old Applewood farm on the very day next\nafter Twelfth-day. They meant with one accord to be at Coombe Lorraine\nby the Saturday night, all being summoned upon church-service. There\nwas not one of them that could be dispensed with--according to the last\nadvices--and they felt their extreme responsibility, when the Grower\nlocked them out of the great white gate.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make fools of yourselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be there\nquite so soon as you think.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They laughed him to scorn; but even before\nthey got to Tonbridge a snowstorm came behind them, and quite smothered\nall their shoulders up, and grizzled the roots of the whiskers of the\nonly one who had any. This was Counsellor Gregory, and the other two\nlaughed at him, and vowed that his wig must have slipped down there,\nand then flicked him with pocket-handkerchiefs.\n\nCounsellor Gregory took no heed. He was wonderfully staid and sapient\nnow; and the day when he had played at darts--if cross-examination\ncould have fetched it up--would have been to his expanded mind a\npainful remembrance of All-fools\u00e2\u0080\u0099 day. He stuck to his circuit, and\ncultivated the art of circuitous language. And being a sound and\ndiligent lawyer, of good face and temper, he was able already to pay a\nclerk, who carried his bag and cleaned his boots.\n\nBut any client who had seen him now driving two spirited horses\nactually in tandem process, and sitting as if he were on the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nBench, would have met him at the gate with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cquo warranto,\u00e2\u0080\u009d if not a\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cquousque tandem?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was well aware of this; his conscience told him\nthat a firm of attorneys abode in the chief street of Tonbridge, and\nin spite of the snow either partner or clerk would almost be sure to\nbe out at the door. He would not have been the Grower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son if he had\ntried to circumvent them; so he drove by their door, and the senior\npartner took off his hat to Mabel, and said that Gregory was a most\nrising young man.\n\nMabel sat in the middle, of course, with a brother on either side to\nbreak the cold wind, and keep off the snow. She laughed at the weather\nat first; but soon the weather had the laugh of her. According to their\nown ideas, they were to put up for the night at the fine old inn at\nHorsham, and make their way thence to Coombe Lorraine in time for\ndinner on the Saturday. For Mabel of course was to be a bridesmaid,\nthe Rector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three daughters, and the Colonel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two, completing the\nnecessary six. But it soon became clear that the Grower knew more about\nroads and weather than the counsellor and the sailor did. By the time\nthese eager travellers passed Penshurst and the home of the Sidneys,\nthe road was some eight or nine inches deep with soft new-fallen snow.\nThey had wisely set forth with a two-wheeled carriage, strong and not\neasily knocked out of gear--no other, in fact, than the old yellow gig\ndisdained by Mrs. Lovejoy. For the look of it they cared not one jot;\nanything was good enough for such weather; and a couple of handsome and\npowerful horses would carry off a great deal worse than that; even if\nthey had thought of it. But they never gave one thought to the matter.\nExcept that the counsellor was a little tamed by \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe law and its\nramifications,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they all took after their father about the _esse_ _v._\nthe _videri_. Nevertheless, they all got snowed up for the Friday night\nat East Grinstead, instead of getting on to Horsham.\n\nFor the further they got away from home, the more they managed to lose\ntheir way. The hedges and the ditches were all as one; the guide-posts\nwere buried long ago; instead of the proper finger and thumb, great\nfists and bellies of drift, now and then, stuck out to stop the\ntraveller. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo thoroughfare here\u00e2\u0080\u009d in great letters of ivy--the ivy\nthat hangs in such deep relief, as if itself relieved by snow--and\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrespassers beware\u00e2\u0080\u009d from an alder, perhaps overhanging a swamp, where,\nif the snow-crust were once cut through a poor man could only toss up\nhis arms, and go down and be no more heard of.\n\nAnd now that another heavy storm was at it (black behind them, and\nwhite in front), the horses asked for nothing better than to be left to\nfind their way. They threw up their forelocks, and jerked their noses,\nand rattled their rings, and expressed their ribs, and fingered away\nat the snow with their feet; meaning that their own heads were the\nbest, if they could only have them. So the counsellor let them have\ntheir heads, for the evening dusk was gathering; and the leader turned\nround to the wheeler, and they had many words about it. And then they\nstruck off at a merry trot, having both been down that road before, and\nsupped well at the end of it. Foreseeing the like delight, with this\nkeen weather to enhance it, they put their feet out at a tidy stretch,\nscuffling one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snowballs; and by the time of candle-lighting,\nlanded their three inferior bipeds at the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreen Man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d at East\nGrinstead.\n\nOn the following day they were still worse off, for although it did not\nsnow again, they got into an unknown country without any landmarks;\nand the cold growing more and more severe, they resolved to follow the\nBrighton road, if ever they should find it. But the Brighton coaches\nwere taken off, and the road so entirely stopped, that they must have\ncrossed without perceiving it. And both the nags growing very tired,\nand their own eyes dazed with so much white, they had made up their\nminds to build themselves a snow-house like the Esquimaux, when the\nsailor spied something in the distance, tall and white against the\nsetting sun, which proved to be Horsham spire. With difficulty they\nreached the town by starlight, and all pretty well frost-bitten; and\nthere they were obliged to spend the Sunday, not only for their horses\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsakes, but equally for their own poor selves.\n\nTo finish a bitter and tedious journey, they started from Horsham\non the Monday morning, as soon as the frozen-out sun appeared; and\nalthough the travelling was wonderfully bad, they fetched to West\nGrinstead by twelve o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and found good provender for man and\nbeast. After an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s halt, and a peck of beans to keep the cold out\nof the horses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stomachs, and a glass of cherry-brandy to do the like\nfor their own, and a visit to the blacksmith (to fetch up the cogs of\nthe shoes, and repair the springs), all set off again in the best of\nspirits, and vowing never to be beaten. But, labour as they might, the\nsun had set ere they got to Steyning; and under the slide of the hills,\nof course, they found the drift grow deeper; so that by the time they\nwere come to the long loose street of West Lorraine, almost every soul\ntherein, having regard to the weather, was tucked up snugly under the\ncounterpane. With the weary leader stooping chin to knee to rub off\nicicles, and the powerful wheeler tramping sedately with his withers\ndown and his crupper up, these three bold travellers, Gregory, Mabel,\nand Charles Lovejoy, sitting abreast in the yellow gig, passed silently\nthrough the deep silence of snow; and not even a boy beheld them, until\nthey came to a place where red light streamed from an opening upon\nthe lane, and cast on the snow the shadow of a tall man leaning on a\ngate. Inside the gate was a square of bright embers, and a man in white\nstockings uncommonly busy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Gregory, stop for a moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mabel, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow warm it looks! Oh,\nhow I wish I was a pig!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey drew up in the ruddy light, and turned their frosted faces, frozen\ncloaks, and numbed hands towards it. And the leader turned round on his\ntraces, and cheered up his poor nose with gazing; for warmth, as well\nas light, came forth in clouds upon the shivering air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a wonderful man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Mabel again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have nobody like him\nin all our parish. He looks very good-natured. Oh, do let us go in, and\nwarm ourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd get our noses frozen off directly we come out. No, thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid Gregory, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will drive on. Get up, Spangler, will you, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe flipped the leader with his frozen lash, and the tall man leaning\nupon the gate (as if he were short of employment) turned round and\nlooked at them, and bade the busy man a very good evening, and came out\ninto the snow, as if he were glad of any wheel track. At the turn of\nthe lane they lost sight of him, slowly as they ploughed their way, and\nin another minute a very extraordinary thing befel them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mabel, as they came to a bank, where once the road might\nhave gone straight on, but now turned sharply to the right, being\nbroken by a broad black water. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am quite sure I heard something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe frost is singing in your ears,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Charlie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is what it\nalways does at sea. Or a blessed cold owl is hooting. Greg, what do you\nsay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will offer my opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the counsellor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen I have\nsufficient data.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when you get your fee endorsed. There it is again! Now did you\nhear it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe stood up between her two brothers, and stayed herself in the mighty\njerks of road, with a hand on the shoulder of each of them. They\nlistened, and doubted her keener ears, and gave her a pull to come back\nagain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a child it is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the counsellor; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe always loses her\nwits when she gets within miles of that blessed Hilary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that all you know about it--now, after all the mischief you have\nmade! You have done your worst to part us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThough still quite a junior counsel, Gregory had been long enough\ncalled to the Bar to understand that women must not be cited to the bar\nof reason. Their opinions deserve the most perfect respect, because\nthey are inspired; and no good woman ever changes them.\n\nAt any rate, Mabel was right this time. Before they could say a word,\nor look round, they not only heard but saw a boy riding and raving\nfuriously, on the other side of the water. He was coming down the\ncourse of the stream towards them as fast as his donkey could flounder,\nand slide, and tear along over the snow-drifts. And at the top of his\nvoice he was shouting,--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA swan, a swan, a girt white swan! The bootiful leddy have turned into\na girt swan! Oh, I never!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you mad, you young fool? Just get back from the water,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nGregory Lovejoy, sternly; for as Bonny pulled up, the horses, weary as\nthey were, jumped round in affright, at Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s white nose and great\nears jerking in a shady place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet back from the water, or we shall\nall be in it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d For the wheeler, having caught the leader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scare, was\nbacking right into the Woeburn, and Mabel could not help a little\nscream; till the sailor sprang cleverly over the wheel, and seized the\nshaft-horse by the head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere she cometh! there she cometh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted Bonny all the while; \u00e2\u0080\u009coh,\nwhatever shall I do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see it! I see it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mabel, leaning over the rail of the gig,\nand gazing up the dark stream steadfastly; \u00e2\u0080\u009coh, what can it be? It is\nall white. And hangs upon the water so. It must be some one floating\ndrowned!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCharlie, the sailor, without a word, ran to a bulge of the bank, as he\nsaw the white thing coming nearer, looked at it for an instant with all\nhis eyes, then flung off his coat, and plunged into the water, as if\nfor a little pleasant swim. He had no idea of the power of the current;\nbut if he had known all about it, he would have gone head-foremost all\nthe same. For he saw in mid-channel the form of a woman, helpless,\nsenseless, at the mercy of the water; and that was quite enough for him.\n\nFrom his childhood up he had been a swimmer, and was quite at his ease\nin rough water; and therefore despised this sliding smoothness. But\nbefore he had taken three strokes, he felt that he had mistaken his\nenemy. Instead of swimming up the stream (which looked very easy to\ndo from the bank), he could not even hold his own with arms and legs\nagainst it, but was quietly washed down by the force bearing into the\ncups of his shoulders. But in spite of the volume of torrent, he felt\nas comfortable as could be; for the water was by some twenty degrees\nwarmer than in the frosty air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCut the traces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he managed to shout, as his brother and sister hung\nover the bank.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does he mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Gregory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake my little knife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mabel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit cuts like a razor; but my hands\nshake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see, I see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d nodded the counsellor; and he cut the long traces of\nthe leader, and knotted them together. Meanwhile Charlie let both\nfeet sink, and stood edgewise in the rapid current, treading water\nquietly. Of course he was carried down stream as he did it; but slowly\n(compared with a floating body). And he found that the movement was\nmuch less rapid, at three or four feet from the surface. Before he had\ntime to think of this, or fairly fetch his balance, the white thing he\nwas waiting for came gliding in the blackness towards him. He flung\nout his arms at once, and cast his feet back, and made towards it. In\nthe gliding hurry, and the flit of light, it passed him so far that\nhe said \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then (perhaps from the attraction of bodies)\nit seemed for a second to stop; and the hand he cast forth laid hold\nof something. His own head went under water, and he swallowed a good\nmouthful; but he stuck to what he had got hold of, as behoves an\nEnglishman. Then he heard great shouting upon dry land, and it made him\nhold the tighter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBravo, my noble fellow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He heard; he was getting a\nlittle tired; but encouragement is everything. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCatch it! catch it! lay\nhold! lay hold!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he heard in several voices, and he saw the splash of\nthe traces thrown, but had no chance to lay hold of them. The power of\nthe black stream swept him on, and he vainly strove for either bank;\nunless he would let loose his grasp, and he would rather drown with it\nthan do that.\n\nNow who saved him and his precious salvage? A poor, despised, and yet\nclever boy, whose only name was Bonny. When Gregory Lovejoy had lashed\nthe Woeburn with his traces vainly, and Mabel had fixed her shawl to\nthe end of them, and the tall man who followed the gig had dropped into\nthe water quietly, and Bottler (disturbed by the shouting) had left his\npigs and shone conspicuous--not one of them could have done a bit of\ngood, if it had not been for Bonny. From no great valour on the part of\nthe boy; but from a quick-witted suggestion.\n\nHis suggestion had to cross the water, as many good suggestions have\nto do; and but for Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge of his voice, nobody would have\nnoticed it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll nab \u00e2\u0080\u0099em down to bridge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009churn down to bridge, and\nee\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll nab \u00e2\u0080\u0099em. Tell \u00e2\u0080\u0099un not to faight so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet your\u00e2\u0080\u0099sen go with the strame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted Bottler to the gallant\nCharlie; \u00e2\u0080\u009cno use faighting for the bank. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tree as crosseth\ndown below; and us\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pull\u00e2\u0080\u0099ee both out, when \u00e2\u0080\u0099a gets there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCharlie had his head well up, and saw the wisdom of this counsel. He\nknew by long battle that he could do nothing against the tenor of the\nWoeburn, and the man who had leaped in to help him, brave and strong\nas he was, could only follow as the water listed. The water went at\none set pace, and swimmers only floated. And now it was a breathless\nrace for the people on the dry land to gain the long tree that spanned\nthe Woeburn, ere its victims were carried under. And but for sailor\nLovejoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skill, and presence of mind, in seeking downward, and\npaddling more than swimming, the swift stream would have been first at\nthe bridge; and then no other chance for them.\n\nAs it was, the runners were just in time, with scarcely a second to\nspare for it. Three men knelt on the trunk of the tree, while Mabel\nknelt in the snow, and prayed. The merciless stream was a fathom below\nthem; but they hung the staunch traces in two broad loops, made good\nat each end in a fork of bough, and they showed him where they were by\nflipping the surface of the water.\n\nClinging to his helpless burden still, and doing his best to support\nit, the young sailor managed to grasp the leather; but his strength was\nspent, and he could not rise, and all things swam around him; the snowy\nbanks, the eager faces, the white form he held, and the swift black\ncurrent--all like a vision swept through his brain, and might sweep\non for ever. His wits were gone, and he must have followed, and been\nswept away to another world, if a powerful swimmer had not dashed up in\nfull command of all faculties. The tall man, whom nobody had heeded in\nthe rush and hurry, came down the black gorge with his head well up,\nand the speed and strength of an osprey. He seized the broad traces\nwith such a grasp that the timber above them trembled, and he bore\nhimself up with his chest to the stream, and tearing off his neckcloth,\nfastened first the drowned white figure, and then poor Charlie, to the\nloop of the strap, and saw them drawn up together; then gathering all\nhis remaining powers, he struck for the bank, and gained it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHurrah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted Bottler! and every one present, Mabel included,\njoined the shout.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe quick, be quick! It is no time for words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the tall man,\nshaking his dress on the snow; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me have the lady; you bring the\nfine fellow as quickly as possible to Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yard. Bottler, just\nshow us the shortest way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bottler answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, Major, you cannot carry\nher, and the drops are freezing on you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo as I told you. Run in front of me; and just show the shortest road.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDash my stockings!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Master Bottler; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be worth looking\nat to-morrow. And all through the snow, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve kept un white. And I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ngot any more clean ones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever he took a short cut to his yard; while Aylmer, with the lady\nin his arms, and her head hanging over his shoulder, followed so fast,\nthat the good pig-sticker could scarcely keep in front of him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried brave Charlie, reviving; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am as right as ever.\nMabel, go on and help; though I fear it is too late to do any good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhoever it is, it is dead as a stone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the counsellor, wiping\nthe wet from his sleeves; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit fell away from me like an empty bag; you\nmight have spared your ducking, Charlie. But it must have been a lovely\nyoung woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDead or alive, I have done my duty. But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know who it is? Oh,\nMabel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow could I see her face?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mabel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe men would not let me touch\nher. And about here I know no one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you do. You know Alice Lorraine. It is poor Sir Roland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndaughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI.\n\nAN ARGUMENT REFUTED.\n\n\nWhile these things were going on down in the valley, a nice little\nargument was raging in the dining-room of the old house on the hill. By\nreason of the bitter weather, Mr. Binns and John Trotman had brought\nin two large three-winged screens of ancient poikolo-D\u00c3\u00a6dal canvas.\nUpon them was depicted every bird that flies, and fish that swims, and\nbeast that walks on the face of the earth, besides many that never did\nanything of the sort. And betwixt them and a roaring fire sat six good\ngentlemen, taking their wine in the noble manner of the period.\n\nUnder the wings of one great screen, Sir Roland Lorraine, and Colonel\nClumps, and Parson Hales were sitting. In the other, encamped\nSir Remnant Chapman, Stephen, his son, and Mr. John Ducksbill, a\nfundamentally trusty solicitor, to see to the deed in the morning.\n\nThe state of the weather brought about all this. It would have been\nbetter for the bridegroom to come with a dash of horses in the morning,\nstir up the church, and the law, and the people, and scatter a pound\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nworth of halfpence. But after so long an experience of the cold white\nmood of the weather, common sense told everybody, that if a thing was\nto be done at all, all who were to do it must be kept pretty well\ntogether.\n\nBut, alas! even when the weather makes everybody cry, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d it is\nworse than the battles of the wind and snow, for six male members of\nthe human race to look at one another with the fire in their front,\nand the deuce of a cold draught in their backs, and wine without stint\nat their elbows, and dwell wholly together in harmony. And the most\nexciting of all subjects unluckily had been started--or rather might be\nsaid \u00e2\u0080\u009cinevitably.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Six gentlemen could not, in any reason, be hoped to\nsit over their wine, without getting into the subject of the ladies.\n\nThis is a thing to be always treated with a deep reserve, and\nconfidential hint of something, that must not go beyond a hint. Every\nman thinks, with his glass in his hand, that he knows a vast deal more\nabout woman than any woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son before him. Opinions at once begin to\nclash. Every man speaks from his own experience; which, upon so grand a\nmatter, is as the claw of a lobster grasping at a whale--the largest of\nthe mammals.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRector, I tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Sir Remnant, with an angry ring of his\nwine-glass, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you know less than nothing about it, sir. All the\nmore to your credit, of course, of course. A parson must stick to his\ncloth and his gown, and keep himself clear of the petticoats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, my dear sir, my own three daughters----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may have got thirty daughters, without knowing anything at all\nabout them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, my good sir, my wife, at least--come now, is that no experience?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may have got sixty wives, sir, and be as much in the dark as ever.\nDucksbill, you know; come now, Ducksbill, give us your experience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir Remnant, I am inclined to think that, upon the whole, your view of\nthe question is the one that would be sustained. Though the subject has\nso many ramifications, that possibly his Reverence----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKnows nothing at all about it. Gadzooks, sir! less than nothing. I\ntell you they have no will of their own any more than they have any\njudgment. A man with a haporth of brains may do exactly what he likes\nwith them. Colonel, you know it; come, Colonel, now, after all your\nbattles----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy battles were not fought amongst the women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Colonel Clumps,\nvery curtly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHear, hear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector, smacking his fat leg, in the joy of a\nnew alliance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Remnant, with his wrath diverted from the\nparson to the soldier; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou mean, I suppose, that my battles have been\nfought among the women only?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI said nothing of the sort. I know nothing of your battles. You\nalluded to mine, and I spoke my mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Colonel Clumps had been vexed by\nSir Remnant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words. He had long had a brother officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widow in his\nmind; and ever since he had been under-fitted with a piece of boxwood,\nhis feelings were hurt whenever women were run down in his presence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChapman, I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland Lorraine, to assuage the rising\nstorm, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat we might as well leave these little points (which have\nbeen in debate for some centuries) for future centuries to settle at\ntheir perfect leisure. Mr. Ducksbill, the wine is with you. Struan, you\nare not getting on at all. My son has been in Portugal, and he says\nthese olives are the right ones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll the other gentlemen took the hint and dropped the pugnacious\nsubject; but Sir Remnant was such a tough old tyrant, that there was no\ndiverting him. He took a mighty pinch of snuff, rapped the corner of\nhis box, and began again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, look you, Lorraine, at that girl of yours, as nice a girl as ever\nlived, and well brought up by her grandmother. A clever girl, too--I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbe dashed if she isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. She has said many things that have made me\nlaugh; and it takes a good joke to do that, I can tell you. But no will\nof her own--no judgment--no what I may call decision.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry to hear it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sir Roland, dryly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought my daughter\nhad plenty of all those.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course you did. All men think that till they find their mistake\nout. Nurse my vittels, if there is any one thing a woman should know\nher own mind about, it would be her own marriage. But, gadzooks,\ngentlemen, Miss Lorraine over and over again declared that she would\nnot have our Steenie; and to-morrow morning she will have him, as merry\nas a grig, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d began Captain Chapman; but as he spoke the screens were\nparted; and Trotman stood there, in all the importance of a great\nnewsbearer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you mean, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Colonel Clumps, whose sedentary\narrangements were suddenly disturbed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cby gad, sir, if I only had my\nbamboo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you plaize, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Trotman, looking only at his master, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\nbe very bad news indeed. Miss Halice have adrowned herself in the\nWoeburn; and her corpse be at Bottler, the pigman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector; and the men either started to their feet,\nor fell back on their chairs according to their constitution. Sir\nRoland alone sat as firm as a rock.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon what authority, au-thor-i-ty----\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sir Roland neither finished\nthat sentence, nor began another. His face became livid; his under-jaw\nfell; he rolled on his side, and lay there. As if by a hand direct from\nheaven, he was struck with palsy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII.\n\nON LETHE\u00e2\u0080\u0099S WHARF.\n\n\nAs soon as the master of the house had been taken to his bedroom, and\na groom sent off at full gallop for the nearest doctor, Mr. Hales went\nup to Stephen Chapman, who was crying in a corner, and hauled him\nforth, and took his hand, and patted him on the shoulder. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, my\ngood fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must not allow yourself to be so overcome;\nthe thing may be greatly exaggerated--everything always is, you know.\nI never believe more than half of a story; and I generally find that\ntwice too much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, but I did so love--love--love her! It does seem too hard upon me.\nOh, Parson, I feel as if I should die almost. When the doctor comes,\nlet him see me first. He cannot do any good to Sir Roland; and Sir\nRoland is old, and he has always been good; but I have been a very bad\nman always----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBad or good, be a man of some sort--not a whining baby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nRector. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPut on your hat, and come out with me, if you have got a bit\nof pluck in you. I am going down to see my poor niece, at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I could not do it! I could never do it! How can you ask me to do\nsuch a thing? And in such weather as this is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Hales replied, buttoning up the collar of his coat; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nhave no son, Stephen Chapman; and I am in holy orders, and therefore\ncanonically debarred from the use of unclerical language; but if I had\na son like you, dash me if I would not kick him from my house-door\nto my mixen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Having thus relieved his mind, the Rector went to the\nmain front passage, and chose for himself a most strenuous staff, and\nthen he pulled the wire of the front-door bell, that the door might be\nfastened behind him. And before any of the scared servants came up, he\nhad thought of something. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is it? Oh, Mrs. Merryjack, is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir; please, sir, the men are all away, and the housemaids too\nfrightened to come up the stairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a good woman. Where is Mrs. Pipkins?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe hath fetched up her great jar of leeches, sir; and she is trying\nthem with poor master. Lord bless you, you might every bit as well put\nhorse radish on him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd better, Merryjack--better, I believe. Now, you are a sensible and\nclever woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir. Oh, Lord, sir, I was never told that; though some folk may a\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were right, every time they said it, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am. And no one has said\nit more often than I have. Now Mrs. Merryjack----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir; yes, sir. Anything you tells me, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is only this: I am going, as fast as I can, to Churchwarden\nBottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. I shall take the short cut, and cross the water. You cannot\ndo that; it would not be safe for a woman, in the dark, to attempt it.\nBut just do this: order the light close carriage as soon as possible.\nThe horses are roughed, to go to church to-morrow. Get inside it, with\nyour warmest cloak on, and blankets, and shawls, and anything else you\ncan think of, and tell the man to drive for his life to Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\nWomen will be wanted there; for one thing, or the other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir; to be sure, sir. We are always wanted. Oh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me, the poor,\nyoung dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Rector set off by a path to the right, passing eastward of the\nCoombe, and leading, as well as might be, to the tree that crossed the\nwater. It was a rough and dreary road; and none but a veteran sportsman\ncould, in that state of the weather, have followed it. But Mr. Hales\nknew every yard of the hill, and when he could trust the drift, and\nwhere it would have been death to venture. And though the moon had set\nlong ere this, the sky was bright, and the sparkle of the stars was\nspread, as in a concave mirror, by the radiance of the snow.\n\nAt Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gate Mr. Hales was rudely repulsed, until they looked at\nhim. Gregory and Bonny were on guard, with a great tarpaulin behind\nthem; each of them having a broom in hand, ready to be thrust into\nanybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. A great glow of light was in the air, and by it their\neyes shone--whether it were with ferocity, or whether it were with\ntenderness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am her own uncle--I must go in. I stand in the place of her father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBonny, of course, knew his master, and opened the paling-gate to let\nhim in. And there Mr. Hales beheld a thing such as he never had seen\nbefore. Every sign of the singeing or dressing of pigs had been done\naway with. The embers of fuel, all around the grey walls, had given\ntheir warmth, and lay quivering. The grey flints, bedded in lime behind\nthem, were of a dull and sulky red; the ground all over the courtyard\nsteamed, as the blow of the frost rose out of it, and the cover spread\noverhead reflected genial warmth and comfort.\n\nNear the middle of the yard, on the mattress, lay the form of\npoor Alice, enfolded in the warm blankets, and Mrs. Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best\ncounterpane. The kind and good woman, with Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help, had removed\nthe wet and freezing clothes, when Major Aylmer had laid his burden in\nMrs. Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parlour. The only hope that the fleeting spirit might\nremain, or return, was to be found in warmth, or rather strong heat,\napplied at once; and therefore (with the Major\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice and aid) clever\nuse had been made of Mr. Bottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great preparations. It is needless\nto say that the pigman (who had now galloped off to Steyning for a\ndoctor) would, if left to himself, have settled matters very speedily,\nby hanging the poor girl up head downwards, to drain off the water\nshe had swallowed. But now, under Major Aylmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care, everything had\nbeen done as well as a doctor could have managed it. The body was laid\nwith the head well up, and partly inclined on the right side, so that\nthe feeble flutter of the heart--if any should arise--might not be\nhindered. The slender feet, so white and beautifully arched, were laid\non a brown stone jar of hot water; and the little helpless palms were\nchafed by the rough hands of Mrs. Bottler. Mabel also spread light\nfriction, with a quick and glancing touch, over the cold heart, frozen\nbreast, and chill relapse of everything. And from time to time she\nendeavoured to inspire the gentle rise and fall of breath.\n\nThe Major came forward and took the hand of his friend, the Rector,\nsilently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs there any hope?\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered Mr. Hales.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLess and less. It is now two hours since we began trying to restore\nher. I was nearly drowned myself, some years ago, and lay for an hour\ninsensible. Every minute that passes now lessens the chance. But this\nyoung lady is wonderfully clever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI only do what you tell me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mabel, looking up without leaving\noff her persevering efforts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFlying in the face of the Almighty, I call it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Bottler,\nwho was very tired, and ought to have had equal share of the praise.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor dear! we had better let her bide till the doctor cometh, or the\ncrowner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot till a doctor declares her dead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Major Aylmer, quietly;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am delighted that you are come, Mr. Hales. You are a great\nreinforcement. I have longed to try my own hand, but--but you can; you\nare her uncle. Perhaps you have not seen a case like this. Will you act\nunder my directions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith all my heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Rector, pulling off his coat, and\npitching it down anywhere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, my dear, my pretty dear, I do believe\nyou will know my touch. Go out of the way, Mrs. Bottler, now--go and\nmake some soup, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am. Mabel and I, Mabel and I, when we get together,\nI do believe we could make a flock of sheep out of a row of flints.\nNow, sir, what am I to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhatever he was told, he did with such a will, that presently Mabel\nlooked up, and exclaimed with breathless delight--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I feel a little\nthrob--I did feel a little flutter of the heart--I am almost sure I\ndid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear girl, rub away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Rector; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is right, Major,\nis not it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe so. Now is the critical time. A relapse--and all is over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere shall be no relapse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector, working away with his\nshirt-sleeves up, and his ruddy face glowing in the firelight; \u00e2\u0080\u009cplease\nGod, there shall be no relapse; the bravest and the noblest maid in the\nworld shall not go out of it. Do you know me, my darling? you ought to\nknow your kind Uncle Struan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPurely white and beautiful as a piece of the noblest sculpture, Alice\nlay before them. Her bashful virgin beauty was (even in the shade of\ndeath) respected with pure reverence. The light of the embers (which\nalone could save her mouldering ash of life) showed the perfect\noutline, and the absence of the living gift, which makes it more than\noutline. Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, intense with vital energy and quick resolve,\nshone and glowed in contrast with the apathy and dull whiteness\nover which she bent so eagerly. Now, even while she gazed, the dim\nabsorption of white cheeks and forehead slowly passed and changed its\ndulness (like a hydrophane immersed) into glancing and reflecting play\nof tender light and life. Rigid lines, set lineaments, fixed curves,\nand stubborn vacancy, began to yield a little and a little, and then\nmore and more, to the soft return of life, and the sense of being alive\nagain.\n\nThere is no power of describing it. Those who have been through it\ncannot tell what happened to them. Only this we know, that we were dead\nand now we live again. And by the law of nature (which we under-crept\nso narrowly) we are driven to the opposite extreme of tingling vitality.\n\nSoftly as an opening flower, and with no more knowledge of the windy\nworld around us, eyelids, fair as Cytherea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, raised their fringe, and\nfell again. Then a long deep sigh of anguish (quite uncertain where it\nwas, but resolved to have utterance), arose from rich, pure depth of\nbreast, and left the kind heart lighter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDarling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mabel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you know me? Open your eyes again, and tell\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlice opened her eyes again; but she could not manage to say anything.\nAnd she did not seem to know any one. Then the doctor pulled up at the\npaling-gate, skipped in, felt pulse, or felt for it, and forthwith\nordered stimulants.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut her to bed in a very warm room. The carriage is here with the\nblankets, but on no account must she go home. Mrs. Bottler will give up\nher best room. Let Mrs. Merryjack sit up all night. She is a cook, she\ncan keep a good fire up. Let her try to roast her young mistress. Only\nkeep the air well moving. I see that you have a first-rate nurse--this\npretty young lady--excuse me, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am. Well I shall be back in a couple\nof hours. I have a worse case to see to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe meant Sir Roland; but would not tell them. He had met the groom from\nCoombe Lorraine; and he knew how the power of life has dropped, from a\nscore of years to threescore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\n\nPOLLY\u00e2\u0080\u0099S DOLL.\n\n\nIn this present state of things, and difficulty everywhere, the one\nthing most difficult of all is to imagine greater goodness than that\nof Mr. Bottler. He had a depression that could not be covered by a\nfive-pound note, to begin with, in the value of the pig-meat he was\ndressing scientifically, when he had to turn it all out to be frozen,\nand take in poor Alice to thaw instead. Of that he thought nothing,\nless than nothing--he said so; and he tried to feel it. But take it\nas you will, it is something. A man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family may be getting lighter,\nas they begin to maintain themselves; but the man himself wants more\nmaintenance, after all his exertions with them; and the wife of his\nold bosom lacks more nourishment than the bride of his young one. More\nmoney goes out as more money comes in.\n\nAnd not only that, but professional pride grows stronger as a man\ngrows older and more thoroughly up to his business, especially if a\nlot of junior fellows, like the man at Bramber, rush in, and invent\nnew things, and boast of work that we know to be clumsy. If any man in\nEngland was proud of the manner in which he turned out his pork, that\nman was Churchwarden Bottler. Yet disappointment combined with loss\ncould not quench his accustomed smile, or plough one wrinkle in his\nsnowy hose, as he quitted his cart on the following morning, and made\nhis best duty and bow to Alice.\n\nAlice, still looking very pale and frail, was lying on the couch in\nthe pigman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drawing-room; while Mabel, who had been with her all the\nnight, sat on her chair by her pillow. Alice had spoken, with tears in\nher eyes, of the wonderful kindness of every one. Her mind was in utter\nconfusion yet as to anything that had befallen her; except that she had\nsome sense of having done some desperate deed, which had caused more\ntrouble than she was worthy of. Her pride and courage were far away.\nHer spirit had been so near the higher realms where human flesh is not,\nthat it was delighted to get back, and substantially ashamed of itself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat will my dear father say? And what will other people think? I seem\nto have considered nothing; and I can consider nothing now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDarling, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to consider,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mabel answered softly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have\nconsidered far too much; and what good ever comes of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cless than none. Consider the lilies that\nconsider not. Oh, my head is going round again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was the roundness of her head, which had saved her life in the long\ndark water. Any long head must have fallen back, and yielded up the\nghost; but her purely spherical head, with the garden-hat fixed tightly\nround it, floated well on a rapid stream, with air and natural hair\nresisting any water-logging. And thus the Woeburn had borne her for a\nmile, and vainly endeavoured to drown her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, why does not my father come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, as soon as she could\nclear her mind; \u00e2\u0080\u009che always used to come at once, and be in such a\nhurry, even if I got the nettle-rash. He must have made his mind up\nnow, to care no more about me. And when he has once made up his mind,\nhe is stern--stern--stern. He never will forgive me. My own father will\ndespise me. Where now, where is somebody?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are getting to be foolish again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mabel; much as it grieved\nher to speak thus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour father cannot come at the very first moment\nyou call for him. He is full of lawyers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 business, and allowances must\nbe made for him. Now, you are so clever, and you have inherited from\nthe Normans such a quick perception. Take this thing; and tell me,\nAlice, what it can be meant for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom the place of honour in the middle of the mantelpiece, Mabel\nLovejoy took down a tool which had been dwelling on her active mind\never since the night before. She understood taps, she had knowledge of\ncogs, she could enter into intricate wards of keys, and was fond of\nletter-padlocks; but now she had something which combined them all; and\nshe could not make head or tail of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought that I knew every metal that grows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as Alice\nopened her languid hand for such a trifle; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI always clean our forks\nand spoons, and my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three silver teapots. But I never beheld\nany metal of such a colour as this has got, before. Can you tell me\nwhat this metal is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought to know something, but I know nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alice answered,\nwearily; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy father is acknowledged to be full of learning. Every\nminute I expect him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt he will tell us, when he comes. But I am so impatient. And\nit looks like the key of some wonderful lock, that nothing else would\nopen. May I ask what it is? Come, at least say that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will give me the greatest delight to know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, with a\nyawn, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat the thing is; because it will please you, darling. And it\ncertainly does look curious.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUpon this question Mrs. Bottler, like a good woman, referred them to\nher learned husband, who came in now from his morning drive, scraping\noff the frozen snow, and accompanied, of course by Polly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPolly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doll, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we call it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe little maid took\nsuch a liking to it, that Bonny was forced to give it to her. Where\nthe boy got it, the Lord only knows. The Lord hath given him the gift\nof finding a\u00e2\u0080\u0099most everything. He hath it both in his eyes and hands. I\nbelieve that boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099d die Lord Mayor of London, if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d only come out of\nhis hole in the hill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut cannot we see him, Mr. Bottler?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mabel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen he is finding\nthese things, does he lose himself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot he, Miss!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the man of bacon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe knows where he is, go\nwhere he will. You can hear him a-whistling down the lane now. He\nknoweth when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve a been easing of the pigs, sharper than my own steel\ndo. Chittlings, or skirt, or milt, or trimmings--oh, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the boy for a\nrare pig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fry--it don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter what the weather is. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d as lief dine\nwith him as at home a\u00e2\u0080\u0099most.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, let me go and see him at the door,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mabel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am so fond of\nclever boys.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So out she ran without waiting for leave, and presently\nran back again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, what a nice boy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed to Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cso\nvery polite, and he has got such eyes! But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sadly afraid he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be\nimpudent when he grows much older.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha, Miss, aha, Miss! you are right enough there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed Mr.\nBottler, with a crafty grin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t over bashful already, perhaps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where do you think he found this most extraordinary instrument? At\nShoreham, drawn up by the nets from the sea! And they said that it must\nhave been dropped from a ship, many and many a year ago, when Shoreham\nwas a place for foreign traffic. And he is almost sure that it must be\na key of some very strange old-fashioned lock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you may depend upon it, that it is a key, and nothing else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nBottler, with his fine soft smile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat boy Bonny hath been about so\nmuch among odds, and ends, and rakings, that he knoweth a bit about\neverything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn old-fashioned key from the sea at Shoreham? Let me think of\nsomething,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, leaning back on her pillow, with her head still\nfull of the Woeburn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI seem to remember something, and then I am not\nat all sure what it is. Oh! when is my father coming?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour father hath sent orders, Miss Alice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bottler, coming back\nwith a good bold lie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you must go up to the house, if you please.\nHe hath so much to see to with them Chapman lot, that he must not leave\nhome nohow. The coach is a-coming for you now just.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Alice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will do as I am told. I mean to do\nalways whatever I am told for all the rest of my life, I am sure. But\nwill you lend me Polly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doll?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord bless you, Miss, I daren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it for my life. Polly would have\nthe house down. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099m is the strangest child as you ever did see, until\nyou knows how to manage her. Her requireth to be taken the right side\nup. Now, if I say \u00e2\u0080\u0098Poll\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to her, her won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do nothing; but if I say\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Polly dear,\u00e2\u0080\u0099--why, there she is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlice was too weak and worn to follow this great question up. But Mabel\nwas as wide awake as ever, although she had been up all night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\nMr. Bottler, just do this: Go and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Polly, dear, will you lend your\ndoll to the pretty lady, till it comes back covered with sugar-plums?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMr. Bottler promised that he would do this; and by the time Alice was\nready to go, square Polly, with a very broad gait, came up and placed\nher doll without a word, in the hands of Alice and then ran away, and\ncould never stop sobbing, until her father put the horse in on purpose,\nand got her between his legs in the cart. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere are you going?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nMrs. Bottler. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will drive to the end of the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m blowed if I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be any gate to pay between this and\nthat, by the look of things. Polly, hold on by daddy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knees.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\n\nFROM HADES\u00e2\u0080\u0099 GATES.\n\n\nIn the old house and good household, warmth of opinion and heat of\nexpression abounded now about everything. Pages might be taken up by\nsaying what even one man thought, and tens of pages would not contain\nthe half of what one woman said. Enough, that when poor Alice was\nbrought back through the snow-drifts quietly, every moveable person in\nthe house was at the door. Everybody loved her, and everybody admired\nher; but now with a pendulous conscience. Also, with much fear about\nthemselves; as the household of Admetus gazed at the pale return of\nAlcestis.\n\nAlice, being still so weak, and quite unfit for anything, was\nfrightened at their faces, and drew back and sank with faintness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSillies!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mabel, jumping out, with Polly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doll inside her muff;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cnaturals, or whatever you are, just come and do your duty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey still hung away, and not one of them would help poor Alice across\nher own father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s threshold, until a great scatter of snow flew about,\nand a black horse was reigned up hotly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou zanies!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou cowardly fools! You never come\nto church, or you would know what to do. You skulking hounds, are you\nafraid of your own master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter? I have got my big whip. By the\nLord, you shall have it. Out of my parish I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll set to and kick every\ndastardly son of a cook of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is my father?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice faintly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hoped that he would have\ncome for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the sound of her voice they began to perceive that she was not the\nghost of the Woeburn; and the Rector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong championship cast at\nonce the broad and sevenfold shield of the church over the maiden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nskeary deed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Uncle Struan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered, hanging upon his arm,\nas he led her in; \u00e2\u0080\u009chave I committed some great crime? Will my father be\nashamed of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe should rather be ashamed of himself, I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, for\nthe present declining the subject which he meant to have out with her\nsome day; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, my dear, he is not quite well; that is why he does not\ncome to see you. And, indeed, he does not know--I mean he is not at all\ncertain how you are. Trotman, open that door, sir, this moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe parson rather carried than led his niece into a sitting-room, and\nset her by a bright fire, and left Mabel Lovejoy to attend to her;\nwhile he himself hurried away to hear the last account of Sir Roland,\nand to consult the doctor as to the admittance of poor Alice. But in\nthe passage he met Colonel Clumps, heavily stumping to and fro, with\neven more than wonted energy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my life and soul, Master Parson, I must get out of this house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009cslashing work, sir, horrible slashing! I had better be under\nOld Beaky again. I came here to quiet my system, sir: and zounds, sir,\nthey make every hair stand up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Colonel, what is the matter now? Surely, a man of war, like\nyou----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir, a man of war I am; but not a man of suicide, and paralysis,\nand precipices, and concussions of the brain, sir--battle, and murder,\nand sudden death--why, my own brain is in a concussion, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo it appears,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Rector softly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut surely, Colonel, you can\ntell us what the news is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe news is just this, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Colonel, stamping, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe two\nChapmans were upset in their coach last night down a precipice, and\nboth killed as dead as stones, sir. They sent for the doctor; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nproof of it; our doctor has had to be off for his life. No man ever\nsends for the doctor, until he is dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is some truth in that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mr. Hales; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe\nit quite yet, at any rate. No doubt they have been upset. I said so\nas soon as I heard they were gone; particularly with their postilions\ndrunk. And I dare say they are a good deal knocked about. But snow is\na fine thing to ease a fall. Whatever has happened, they brought on\nthemselves by their panic and selfish cowardice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, they ran like rats from a sinking ship, when they saw poor Sir\nRoland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition. Alice had frightened them pretty well; but the\nother affair quite settled them. Sad as it was, I could scarcely help\nlaughing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA sad disappointment for your nice girls, Colonel. Instead of a gay\nwedding, a house of death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd for your pretty daughters, Rector, too. However, we must not think\nof that. You have taken in the two Lovejoys, I hear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGregory and Charlie? Yes, poor fellows. They were thoroughly scared\nlast night, and of course Bottler had no room for them. That Charlie is\na grand fellow, and fit to follow in the wake of Nelson. He was frozen\nall over as stiff as a rick just thatched, and what did he say to me?\nHe said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall get into the snow and sleep. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wet mother\nBottler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s floor.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell done! well said! There is nothing in the world to equal English\npluck, sir, when you come across the true breed of it. Ah, if those\nd----d fellows had left me my leg, I would have whistled about my arm,\nsir. But the worst of the whole is this, supposing that I am grossly\ninsulted, sir, how can I do what a Briton is bound to do--how can I\nkick--you know what I mean, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, Colonel, if you can manage to spin round like that, you need\nnot despair of compassing the national salute. But here we are at Sir\nRoland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door. Are we allowed to go in? or what are the orders of the\ndoctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes; he is quite unconscious. You might fire off a cannon close\nto his ear, without his starting a hair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breadth. He will be so for\nthree days, the doctor thinks; and then he will awake, and live or die\naccording as the will of the Lord is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of us do that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the parson; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut what shall I say to his\ndaughter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLeave her to me. I will take her a message, sir. I have been hoaxed so\nin the army, that now I can hoax any one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe you are right. She will listen to you a great deal more than\nshe would to me. Moreover, I want to be off, as soon as I have seen\npoor Sir Roland. I shall ride on, and ask how the Chapmans are. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbelieve they are dead; they are far too tough. What a blessing it is\nto have you here, Colonel, with the house in such a state! How is that\nconfounded old woman, who lies at the bottom of all this mischief?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady Valeria Lorraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Colonel, rather stiffly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis as well\nas can be expected, sir. She has been to see her son Sir Roland, and\nher grandson Hilary. My opinion is that this brave girl inherits her\nspirit from her grandmother. Whatever happens, I am sure of one thing,\nshe ought to be the mother of heroes, sir; not the wife of Steenie\nChapman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the Rector; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit will take a brave man to marry her,\nafter what she has done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStuff and nonsense!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the Colonel; \u00e2\u0080\u009ca good man will value her\nall the more, and scorn the opinion of the county, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Rector, in his own stout heart, was much of the same persuasion;\nbut it would not do for him to say so yet. So, after a glance at Sir\nRoland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wan and death-like features, he rode forth with a sigh, to\nlook after the Chapmans.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV.\n\nSOMETHING LIKE A LEGACY.\n\n\nA grand physician being called from London, pronounced that Sir\nRoland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case was one of asthenic apoplexy, rather than of pure\nparalysis. He gave the proper directions, praised the local\npractitioners, hoped for the best, took his fifty guineas with\npromptitude, and departed. If there were any weight on the mind, it\nmust be cast aside at once, as soon as the mind should have sense of\nit. For this a little effort might be allowed, \u00e2\u0080\u009csuch as the making of a\nwill, or so forth, or good-bye to children; for on the first return of\nsense, some activity was good for it. But after that, repose, dear sir,\ninsist on repose, and nourishing food. No phlebotomy--no, that is quite\na mistake; an anachronism, a barbarism, in such a case as this is. It\nis an\u00c3\u00a6mia, with our poor friend, and vascular inaction. No arterial\nplethorism; quite the opposite, in fact. You have perfectly diagnosed\nthe case. How it will end I cannot say, any more than you can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOne more there was, one miserable heart, perpetually vexed and torn,\nthat could not tell how things would end, if even they ended anyhow.\nAlice Lorraine could not be kept from going to her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bed, and\nshe was not strong enough yet to bear the sight of the wreck before her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my doing--my doing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009coh, what a wicked thing I must\nhave done, to be punished so bitterly as this!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you please, Miss, to go away with your excitement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old\nnurse, who was watching him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou promised to behave yourself; and this\nis how you does it! Us never can tell what they hears, or what they\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; when they lies with their ears pricked up so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNurse, I will go away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI always do more harm than good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe only comfort she now could get flowed from the warm bright heart\nof Mabel. Everybody else gave signs of being a little, or much, afraid\nof her. And what is more dreadful for any kind heart, than for other\nhearts to dread it? She knew that she had done a desperate thing; and\nshe felt that everybody had good reason for shrinking away from her\nlarge deep eyes. She tried to keep up her courage, in spite of all that\nwas whispered about her; and, truly speaking, her whole heart vested in\nher father and her brother.\n\nMabel watched the whole of this, and did her best to help it. But sweet\nand good girl as she was, and in her way very noble, she belonged to a\nstratum of womanhood distinct from that of Alice. She would never have\njumped into the river. She would simply have defied them to take her to\nchurch. She would have cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere I am, and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t marry any man,\nunless I love him. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love this man; and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have him. Now do\nyour worst, every one of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A sensible way of regarding the thing,\nexcept for the need of the money.\n\nOn the third day, Sir Roland moved his eyes, and feebly raised one\nelbow. Alice sat there at his side, as now she was almost always\nsitting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you would only give me one little\nsign that you know me. Just to move your darling hand, or just to give\nme one little glance. Or, if I have no right to that----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo away, Miss; leave the room, if you please. My orders was very\nparticular to have nobody near him, when he first begins to take notice\nto anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlice, with a deep sigh, obeyed the orders of the cross old dame;\nand when the doctor came she received her reward in his approval.\nIt was pitiful to see how humble this poor girl was now become. The\naccident to the Chapmans, her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cstroke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d poor Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruin,\nthe lowering of the family for years, had all been attributed to\nher \u00e2\u0080\u009cwicked sin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Lady Valeria, whose wrath was boundless at the\noverthrow of all her plans.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat good have you done? What good have you done by such a heinous\noutrage? You have disgraced yourself for ever. Who will ever look at\nyou now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody, I am afraid, Madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alice answered, with a blush.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know what I mean, as well as I do. Even if you were drowned, I\nbelieve you would catch at the words of your betters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDrowning people catch at straws,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered with a shudder of\nmemory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you could not even drown yourself. You were too clumsy to do even\nthat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, with a smile almost resembling that of\nbetter times; \u00e2\u0080\u009csurely even you will admit that I did my best towards\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, you flighty child, leave my room, and go and finish killing your\nfather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow when the doctor came and saw the slight revival of his patient,\nhe hurried in search of Miss Lorraine, towards whom he had taken a\nliking. After he had given his opinion of the case, and comforted\nher until she cried, he said--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you must come and see him. And if\nyou can think of anything likely to amuse him, or set his mind in\nmotion--any interesting remembrance, or suggestion of mild surprise, it\nwill be the very best thing possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut surely, to see me again will sufficiently astonish him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not likely. In most of these cases perfect oblivion is the\nrule as to the occurrence that stimulated the predisposition to these\nattacks. Sir Roland will not have the smallest idea that--that anything\nhas happened to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd so it proved. When Alice came to her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, he looked at\nher exactly as he used to do, except that his glance was weak and\nwavering, and full of desire to comfort her. The doctor had told her to\nlook cheerful, and even gay--and she did her best. Sir Roland had lost\nall power of speech; but his hearing was as good as ever; and being\nordered to take turtle-soup, he was propped up on a bank of pillows,\nand doing his best to execute medical directions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, my darling, darling!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice, after a little while, being\nleft to feed her father delicately: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have got such a surprise for\nyou! You will say you were never so astonished in all the course of\nyour life before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe knew how her father would have answered if he had been at all\nhimself. He would have lifted his eyebrows, and aroused her dutiful\ncombativeness, with some of that little personal play which passes\nbetween near relatives, who love and understand each other. As it was,\nhe could only nod, to show his anxiety for some surprise. And then\nAlice did a thing which under any other circumstances, would have been\nmost inconsistent in her. In the drawer of his looking-glass she found\nhis best-beloved snuff-box, and she put one little pinch between his\nlimp forefinger and white thumb, and raised them towards the proper\npart, and trusted to nature to do the rest. A pleasant light shone\nforth his eyes; and she felt that she had earned a kiss. Betwixt a\nsmile and a tear, she took it; and then, for fear of a chill, she\ntucked him up, and sat quietly by him. She had learned, as we learn in\nour syntax, what \u00e2\u0080\u009cvacuis committere venis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen he had slept for two or three hours, with Alice hushing the sound\nof her breath, he was seized with sudden activity. His body had been\ngreatly strengthened by the most nourishing of all food; and now his\nmind began to aim at like increase of movement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you think I have got to show you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice, perceiving this\ncondition. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing less, I do believe, than the key of the fine old\nAstrologer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case! Of course, I can only guess, because you have got it\nlocked away, papa. But from the metal looking just the same, and the\nshape of it, and the seven corners, and its being found at Shoreham, in\nthe sea, where Memel was said to have lost it, I do think it must be\nthat very same key. And I found it, papa--well I found it under rather\npeculiar circumstances. Now may I go and try? There can be no harm, if\nit turns out to be pure fancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer father nodded, and pointed to a drawer where he kept his important\nkeys, as his daughter of course was well aware. And in five minutes,\nAlice came back again, with the strange old case in one hand, and\nPolly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s queer doll in the other. Mabel lingered in the passage, not\nbeing sure that she ought to come in, though Alice tried to fetch her.\nThen Alice set the case, or cushion, upon her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bedside table,\nand with a firm hand pushed the key down, and endeavoured to turn it.\nNot a tittle would anything yield or budge; although it was clear to\nthe dullest eye that lock and key belonged together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the key, papa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit fits to a hair; but it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nturn. This queer old thing goes round and round, instead of staying\nquiet, and waiting to be unlocked justly. I suppose my hands are too\nweak. Oh there! Provoking thing, it goes round again. I know how I\ncould manage it, if I may, my darling father. In the Astrologer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room,\nI saw a tremendous vice, fit to take anything. I have inherited some of\nhis turn for tools and mechanism; though of course in a most degenerate\ndegree. Now may I go up? I shall have no fear whatever, if Mabel comes\nwith me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWinning mute assent, she ran for the key of that room, and took Mabel\nwith her: and soon they had that obstinate case set fast in a vice,\nwhose screw had not been turned for more than two centuries. The bottom\nof the cone was hard and solid, and bedded itself in the old oak slabs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow turn, Mabel, turn; the key is warped, or we might apply more\nforce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice. They did not know that it had been crooked by the\njaws of Jack the donkey. Even so, it would not yield, until they passed\nan ancient chisel through its loop, and worked away. Then, with a thin\nand sulky screech, the cogs began to move, and the upper half of the\ncase to slide aside.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I am so frightened, Alice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mabel, drawing back her hands.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the room is so cold! It seems so unholy! It feels like witchcraft!\nAnd all his old tools looking at us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWitch or wizard, or necromancer, I am not going to leave off now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nanswered Alice the resolute. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may run away, if you like. But I mean\nto get to the bottom of this, if I--if I can, at least.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was going to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I die for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But she had been so close to\nDeath quite lately, that she feared to take his name in vain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow slowly it moves! How it does resist!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mabel, returning to\nthe charge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought I was pretty strong--well, it ought to be worth\nsomething for all this work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is fire-proof! It is lined with asbestos!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alice answered eagerly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, there must be an enormous lot of gold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mabel; why a thousand guineas is more than you\nor I could carry. And you carried this easily in one hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk so!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut work away. I am desperately anxious.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for me, I am positively dying of curiosity. Lend me your\npocket-handkerchief, dear. I am cutting my hands to pieces.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere it comes, I do believe. Well, what an extraordinary thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe dome of the cone had yielded sulkily to the vigour and perseverance\nof two good young ladies. It had slidden horizontally, the key of\ncourse sliding with it, upon a strong rack of metal, which had been\npurposely made to go stiffly; and now that the cover had passed the\ncogs, it was lifted off quite easily. All this was the handiwork of the\nman, the simple-minded Eastern sage, who loved the shepherds and the\nsheep; and whose fine spirit would have now rejoiced to see the result\nof good workmanship.\n\nThe two fair girls poured hair together, with forehead close to\nforehead, when the round substantial case lay coverless before them. A\ndisc of yellow parchment was spread flat on the top of everything, with\nits edges crenelled into the asbestos lining. Hours, and perhaps days\nof care, had been spent by clever brain and hands, to keep the air and\ndust out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho shall lift it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mabel, panting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am almost afraid to move.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will lift it, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am his descendant; and he\nforesaw that I should do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took from the lathe a little narrow tool for turning ivory (which\nhad touched no hand since the Prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s), and she delicately loosened\nup the parchment, and examined it. It was covered with the finest\nmanuscript, in concentric rings, beginning with half an inch of\ndiameter; but she could not interpret a word of that. Below it shone a\nthick flossy layer of the finest mountain wool; and under that the soft\nspun amber of the richest native silk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Alice, do you mean to stop all night!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mabel; \u00e2\u0080\u009csee how the\nlight is fading!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe light was fading, and spreading also, in a way that reminded Alice\n(although the season and the weather were so entirely different) of\nher visit to that room two and a half long years ago, alone among the\nshadows. The white light, with the snow-gleam in it, favoured any\ninborn light in everything else that was beautiful.\n\nAlice, with the gentlest touch of the fairy-gifts of her fingers,\nraised the last gossamer of the silk, and drew back and sighed with\nwonder. Mabel (always prompt to take the barb and shaft of everything)\nleaned over, and looked in, and at once enlarged her eyes and mouth in\npurest stupefaction.\n\nBefore and between these two most lovely specimens of the human race,\nlay the most beautiful and more lasting proofs of what nature used to\ndo, before the production of women. Alice and Mabel, with the light\nin their eyes and the flush in their fair cheeks quivering, felt that\ntheir beauty was below contempt--except in the opinion of stupid\nmen--if compared with what they were looking at.\n\nOf all the colours cast by nature on the world, as lavishly as\nShakespeare threw his jewels forth, of all the tints of sun and heaven\nin flower, sea and rainbow, there was not one that did not glance, or\ngleam, or lie in ambush, and then suddenly flash forth, and blush and\nthen fall back again. None of them waited to be looked at; all were in\nperpetual play; they had been immured for centuries; and when the glad\nlight broke upon them, forth they danced like meteors. And then, as\nall quick with life, they began to weave their crossing rays, and cast\ntheir tints through one another, like the hurtling of the Aurora. And\nto back their fitful brilliance, in amongst them lay and spread a soft,\ndelicious, milky way of bashful white serenity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is terrible witchcraft!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried dazzled Mabel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is the noblest casket ever seen, of precious\nopals, and of pearls. You shall carry them to my father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, I will not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the generous Mabel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have earned, and\nyou shall offer them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\n\nSCIENTIFIC SOLUTION.\n\n\nBeauty having due perception and affection for itself, it is natural\nthat young ladies should be much attached to jewels. It does not,\nhowever, follow that they know anything about them, any more than they\nalways do about other objects of their attachment. Nevertheless, they\nalways want to know the money-value.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should say that they are worth a thousand pounds, if they are worth\na penny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mabel, sagely shaking her head, and looking wonderfully\nlearned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA thousand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTen thousand, you mean. Now put it all back\nas we found it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, one more glance, one more good look, before other people see them!\nOh, let the light fall sideways.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMabel, in her admiration of them, danced all round the Astrologer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nroom, whisking the dust from the wheel of his lathe, and scattering\nquaint rare tools about; while Alice, calmly smiling at her, repacked\nthe case, silk, wool, and parchment, and giving her friend the cover to\ncarry, led the way towards her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room.\n\nSir Roland Lorraine was so amazed, that for the moment the mind resumed\ncommand of the body; the needful effort was made; and he \u00e2\u0080\u009cspake with\nhis tongue\u00e2\u0080\u009d once more, though feebly and inarticulately.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFather, darling, that is worth more to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice, throwing her\narms around him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthan all the jewels that ever were made from the\nfirst year of the world to this. Oh, I could never, never live, without\nhearing your dear voice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was long, however, before Sir Roland recovered mind and spirit, so\nas to attempt a rendering of the provident sage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s document The writing\nwas so small, that a powerful lens was wanted for it; the language,\nmoreover, was Latin, and the contractions crabbed to the last degree.\nAnd crammed as it was with terms of art, an interpreter might fairly\ndoubt whether his harder task would be to make out the words or their\nmeaning. But omitting some quite unintelligible parts, it seemed to be\nsomewhat as follows:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, descendant of mine in far-off ages, neither be thou carried away\nby desire of riches, neither suppose thine ancestor to have been so\ncarried. I bid thee rather to hold thy money in the place of nothing,\nand to be taught that it is a work of royal amplitude and most worthy\nof the noblest princes, to conquer the obstinacy of nature by human\nskill and fortitude. Labouring much, I have accomplished little;\nseeking many things, I have found some; it is not just that I should\nbe forgotten, or mingled with those of my time and rank, who live by\nviolence, and do nothing for the benefit of humanity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmong many other things which I have by patience and learning\nconquested, the one the most likely of all to lead to wealth is of\na simple kind. To wit, as Glaucus of Chios (following up the art of\nCelmis and Damnameneus) discovered the \u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00bb\u00ce\u00bb\u00ce\u00b7\u00cf\u0083\u00ce\u00b9\u00cf\u0082 of iron, so have I\ndiscovered that of jewels--the opal, and perhaps the ruby. As regards\nthe opal, I am certain; as regards the ruby, I have still some\ndifficulties to conquer. All who know the opal can, with very clear\nvision, perceive that its lustre and versatile radiance flow from\ninnumerable lamins, united by fusion in the endless flux of years.\nHaving discovered how to solve the opal with a caustic liquor\u00e2\u0080\u009d--here\nfollowed chemical marks which none but a learned chemist could\nunderstand--\u00e2\u0080\u009cand how to recompose it, I have spent twelve months in\nHungary, collecting a full medimnus of small opals of the purest\nquality. After many trials and a great waste of material, I have\naccomplished things undreamed by Baccius, Evax, or Leonardus; I have\nproduced the priceless opal, cast to mould, and of purest water, from\nthe size of an avellan-nut to that of a small castane. Larger I would\nnot make them, knowing the incredulity of mankind, who take for false\nall things more than twice the size of their own experience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas! it is allowed to no man, great works having been carried\nthrough, to see what will become of them. These gems of inestimable\nvalue, polished by their own liquescence, and coherent as the rainbow,\ndemand, as far as I yet can judge, at least a hundred years of darkness\nand of cavernous seclusion, such as nature and the gods require for all\nperfect work. And when the air is first let in, it must be very slowly\ndone, otherwise all might fall abroad, as though I had never touched\nthem. For this, with the vigilance of a great philosopher, I have\nprovided.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, farewell, whether descended from me, or whether (if the fates\nwill) alien. A philosopher who has penetrated, and under the yoke led\nnature, is the last of all men to speak proudly, or record his own\ngreat deeds. That he leaves for inferior and less tranquil minds, as\nare those of the poets. Only do not thou sell these gems for little,\nif thou sell them. The smallest of them is larger and finer than that\nof the Senator Nonius, or that which is called \u00e2\u0080\u0098Troy burning,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 from\nthe propugnacled flash of its movement. Be not misled by jewellers.\nRogues they are, and imitators, and perpetually striving to make gain\ndisgracefully. Hearken thou not to one word of these; but keep these\njewels, if thou canst. If narrow matters counsel sale, then go to the\nking of thy country, or great nobles, who will not wrong thee. And be\nsure that thou keep them well advised, that neither in skill of hand\nnor in learning should they attempt to vie with Agasicles the Carian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\n\nHER HEART IS HIS.\n\n\nLong ere the writing of the diffident sage had been thus interpreted,\nthe casket, or rather its contents (being intrusted to the wary hands\nof the Counsellor, on his return to London) had passed the severest\ntest and been pronounced of enormous value. The great philosopher\nhad not deigned to say a word about the pearls, whether produced or\namalgamated by his skill, or whether they were heirlooms in his ancient\nfamily. The jewellers said that they were Cingalese, and of the rarest\nquality; and for these alone one large house (holding a commission from\na coalowner), offered fifteen, and then twenty, and finally twenty-five\nthousand pounds. But Sir Roland had resolved not to part with these,\nbut divide them between his daughter and future daughter-in-law, if\nhe could raise the required sum without them. In this no difficulty\nwas found. Though opals were not in fashion just then (and indeed they\nare even now undervalued, through a stupid superstition), six of the\nsmaller gems were sold for \u00c2\u00a365,000, and now their owners would not\naccept double that price for them.\n\nLady Valeria right quickly discarded her terror of the casket, and very\nquietly appropriated the magnificent central gem. It was the cover,\nwith its spiral coils of metal, which had frightened her ladyship. The\nstrongest-minded ladies are, as a general rule, the most obstinate in\ntheir dread of what has injured them. The Earl of Thanet, this lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfather, had been a great lover of the honey-bee, and among his other\nexperiments, he had a small metal hive, which his daughter upset, with\nresults which need not trouble us so much as they troubled the lady.\nAnd although so much smaller, the Astrologer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case strangely resembled\nthat deadly hive.\n\nWhen Hilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sin had been purged, and himself (at certainly a somewhat\nheavy figure) allowed to draw his sword again, he soon regained all his\nformer strength, and health, and perhaps a little more than his former\nshare of wisdom. But he did not march into Paris as Colonel Clumps had\nonce predicted; or at least not in that memorable year 1814. But in\nJuly of the following year, he certainly put in an appearance there,\nunder the immortal Wellington, who had been truly pleased to have him\nunder his command, but never on his Staff, again. And Hilary Lorraine,\nat Waterloo, had shown most clearly (through the thick of the smoke)\nthat if the Duke had erred about his discretion, he had made no mistake\nabout his valour.\n\nAnd it was, of course, tenfold more valorous of him to carry on as he\ndid there, when he called to mind that he had at home a lovely wife,\nof the name of Mabel, and a baby of the name of Roger. Because he had\ntaken advantage of the piping time of peace,--when all the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrowned\nheads\u00e2\u0080\u009d were in England,--to put on his own head that \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrown of glory\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n(richer than mural or civic) whereof the wise man speaks the more\nwarmly, because he had so many of them. In June 1814, Hilary and Mabel\nwere made one, under junction of the good Rector; and nature, objecting\nto this depopulating fusion of her integrals, had sternly recouped her\narithmetic, by appeal to the multiplication table.\n\nAt Waterloo, Hilary worked his right arm much harder than he worked it\nthrough the rest of his life; because there he lost it. When the French\nCuirassiers made their third grand charge upon the British artillery,\nto change the fortune, or meet their fate, Lorraine, with his troop of\nthe Dasher-Hussars, now commanded by Colonel Aylmer, was in front of\nthe rest of the regiment. The spirit of these men was up; they had been\na long while held back, that day, and they could not see any reason\nwhy they should not have their turn at it. Man and horse were of one\naccord, needing no spur, neither heeding bridle. As straight as hounds\nin full view, they flew; and Hilary flew in front of them. In the crush\nand crash, he got rolled over, dismounted, and left slashing wildly in\na storm of horses. An enormous cuirassier made at him, with a sword of\nmonstrous length. Their eyes met, and they knew each other--the robber\nand the robbed; the crafty plotter and the simple one; the victor and\nthe victim.\n\nAlcides cried in Spanish--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art at thy latest gasp; I have no\norders now from my precious wife--receive this, and no more of thee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWith rowels deep in the flank of his horse, he made a horrible swoop\nat Hilary, spent of strength and able only to present a feeble guard.\nHilary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blade spun round and round, and his right arm flew off at the\nelbow; and the crash was descending upon his poor head, when a stern\nreply met Alcides. Through the joints of his harness Joyce Aylmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsword went in, and drank his life-blood. His horse dashed on the plain,\nlike the felled trunk of a poison-tree,--that plain where lay so many\nnobler, and so few meaner than himself. Having run through the whole of\nthe stolen money, he had donned the French cuirass, and left his wife\nand infant child to starve.\n\nWhen the times of slaughter passed, and Nature began to be aware again\nthat she has other manure than bloodshed; when even the cows could low\nwithout fear of telling where their calves were, and mares could lick\ntheir foals unwept on; and hills and valleys began again to listen to\nthe voice of quiet waters (drowned no more in the din of the drum); and\neverything in our dear country was most wonderfully dear,--something\nhappened at this period not to be passed over. Parenthetically it may\nbe said--and deserves no more than parenthesis--that neither of the\nChapmans had been killed (as mendacious fame reported), only knocked on\nthe head, and legs, and stomach, and other convenient places. Steenie\nwedded their housemaid Sally; and it was the best thing he could have\ndone, to clean up the steps of the family.\n\nBut now there is just time to say that it must have been broad August,\nwhen the fields were growing white for harvest, after the swath of\nWaterloo, ere Colonel Aylmer durst bring forth what he nursed in his\nheart for Alice. His words were short and simple, though he did not\nmean to make them so. But he found her in old Chancton Ring, where\nfirst he had beholden her; and so much came across him, that he never\ntook his hat off, but just whispered underneath it. The whisper went\nunder a prettier hat, where it long had been expected; and if a feather\nwaved at all, it only was a white one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you not afraid of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Alice Lorraine, with a tremulous\nglance, enough to terrify any one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat I am, to the last degree. I never shall get over it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat augurs well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied with a smile--such a smile as none else\ncould give; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I mean more than that; I mean your fear of what the\nworld will say of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf that I am infinitely more afraid. It will vex me so to hear for\never--\u00e2\u0080\u0098What has he done to deserve such a wife?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen what he has done is simply this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alice, looking nobly; \u00e2\u0080\u009che\nhas saved her life, and her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s: he has taught her now to fear\nherself; and her heart is his, if he cares for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\n\nTHE LAST WORD COMES FROM BONNY.\n\n\nIt takes but little time to tell what happened to the rest of them. Sir\nRoland Lorraine had the pleasure of seeing two tribes of grandchildren\nround him, who routed him out of his book-room, and scattered his\nunwholesome tendencies wholesale. If he shocked society in his middle\nage, society had revenge in the end, and pursued him, like the\nEumenides. The difference was this, however, that here were truly\nwell-meaning ones, not called so by timorous truckling. And another\npoint of distinction might be found in the style of their legs and\nbodies. Also, they had no \u00e2\u0080\u009cstony glare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the brightest of all young\neyes, that shine like a flower filled with morning dew.\n\nThese little men and women played at hide-and-seek, and made rich\necho in the Woeburn channel. Forsooth, that fearful stream (like\nother fateful rivers), beaten by Vulcanian fires of Bottler--or, as\nsome people said (who knew not Bottler), by the power of the long dry\nfrost--retired into the bowels of the earth, and never means to come\nforth again. But before leaving off it did one good thing--it drowned\nold Nanny Stilgoe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cProphet of ill, never yet to me spakest thou thing\nlucksome\u00e2\u0080\u009d--this was the sentiment of that river when disappointed of\nAlice. Old Nanny ran out of her door next day, with a stick, at a boy\nwho cast snowballs, and she slipped on some ice, and in she went; and\nsome people tried to rake her out, but she was too perverse for them.\nHer prophecies of evil fell, like lead on her head, and sank her; and\nthe parish was fiercely divided whether she ought to have Christian\nburial. But Rector Hales let them talk as they liked, and refused to\nhear reason about it. He had made up his own mind what to do (which of\nall things is the foremost); so he buried old Nanny and paid for it all\nand set up her tombstone, whereon the sculptor, with visions of his own\ndate prolonged, set down her figure at 110.\n\nThe passing of time is one of those things that most astonish every\none. For instance, no one would ever believe, except with a hand\nupon either temple, that Applewood farm is now carried on, and all\nthe growing business done, by a sturdy and highly enlightened young\nfellow, whose name is Struan Lovejoy. He owes his origin to a heavy\ncold, caught by his father (the present highly respected Admiral Sir\nCharles Lovejoy), through the freezing of his naval trousers, and\nthe coddling which of course ensued. Charlie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart lay open through\nall the stages of catarrh, and he felt, even in the worst fits of\nsneezing, whose initials were done in hair on three handkerchiefs under\nhis pillow. In short, no sooner did his nose begin to resume its duty\nin the system, and his eyes to cease from running, then he took Cecil\nHales by the hand, and said that he had something to say to her. And he\nsaid it well; as sailors do. And she could not deny that it might mean\nsomething, if ever they could maintain themselves.\n\nThis is what all young people say; some with a little, and some with\nless, discretion upon the subject. The helm of all the question hangs\nupon the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own sternpost. There is no time to talk of that. Charlie\nmarried Cecil; and they had a son called \u00e2\u0080\u009cStruan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStruan Lovejoy took the turn for gardening and for growing, which had\nfailed the Lovejoy race in the middle generation. Gout descends, and so\ndoes growing, with a skip of one step of mankind; and you cannot make\nthe wrong generation lay heel on spade or toe in slipper.\n\nBut most of us can make some men feel--however small our circle\nis--that there is room for them inside it. That we scorn hypocritical\nlove of mean humanity; but love the noble specimens--when we get them.\nThat we know how short our time is, and attempt to do a little forward\nfor the slowly rolling age. In a word, that, taking things altogether,\nthey are pretty nearly as good as could have been hoped for, even sixty\nyears ago.\n\nBut it is quite a few years back, to wit in 1861, when the great\nleading case upon rights of way--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLovejoy _v._ Shatterlocks\u00e2\u0080\u009d--was\ntried for the ninth and final time. Chief Justice Sir Gregory Lovejoy,\nthrough feelings of delicacy, left the Bench, and would not even\nallow his wife--our Phyllis Catherow--to be called. But Major-general\nSir Hilary Lorraine marched into the witness-box; and so vividly did\nhe call to mind what had passed (and what had been stopped at the\nwhite gate, and where the key was kept) half a century ago, that the\ndefendant had no leg to stand upon. Mabel (who heard all his evidence,\nwith an Alice Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand in hers) vowed that he made a confusion of\nkeys, and was thinking of the gate where she came to meet him. And when\nhe had time for more reflection, he could not contradict her.\n\nNow what says Bonny? He sits on his hill. He sees his life before him.\nThough he does not know that for finding the key, he is to have \u00c2\u00a31000,\ninvested already, and to accumulate, until he entirely settles down. In\nfulness of time he will cast away the unsaleable portion of his rags,\nand wed square Polly Bottler. Their hearts are as one; they only wait\nfor parental assent, and the band or bann--whichever may be the proper\nword--shouted thrice by the Rector, defiant of the world to forbid\nthose two. They are not ready yet to be joined together; but they are\npolishing their fire-irons.\n\nMeanwhile Bonny may be seen to sit on one of those wonderful nicks of\nthe hill, which seem to be scolloped by nature and padded, to tempt\nher restless mankind to rest. For here the curve of the slope is so\nsnug, that only pleasant airs find entry, with the flowery tales they\nbring, and the grass is of the greenest, and the peep into the lowland\ndistance of the most refreshing blue. Lulled on a bank here Bonny sits,\nnot quite so fair as the fairy-queen (who perhaps is watching him\nunseen), but picturesque enough for the age, and provided with a donkey\nworthy of Titania\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purest love. Jack is gazing with deep interest at\nan image of himself, cleverly shaped by his master on the green with\nsnowy outline of chalky flints. Here are set forth his long tail, white\nnose, and ears as long and rich as the emblem of fair Ceres. He sniffs\nat his nose, and he treads on his toes, and not being able to explain\naway all things, he falls to and grazes from his own stomach.\n\nBut what is Bonny doing here, instead of attending to his rags and\nbones? Well, he ought to be, but he certainly is not, attending to the\nRector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sheep. To wit, Mr. Hales, growing stiff in the saddle, betakes\nhimself freely to saddles of mutton; and has paid, and is paying,\nhis three daughters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 portions, after the manner of the patriarchs.\nBut leaving the flock to their own devices (for which, an he were\nsatirical, he might quote his master as precedent), Bonny opens his\ncapacious mouth, and the fresh air of the Downs rings richly, with a\nsimple\n\n    SOUTHDOWN SONG.\n\n    1\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the sheep are on the hill,\n      In the early summer day,\n    They may wander at their will,\n      While I go myself astray.\n        _Chorus (sustained by sheep and Jack)._\n    We may wander at our will,\n      While you go to sleep, or play!\n\n    2\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the May wind hath an edge\n      Rather winterly and cold,\n    I shall sit beneath a hedge,\n      While they wander o\u00e2\u0080\u0099er the wold.\n        _Chorus (by the same performers)._\n    There you sit beneath the hedge,\n      Singing like a minstrel bold!\n\n    3\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cShould ill-natured people say\n      That I loiter, or do ill,\n    Pick a hole in me they may--\n      When they see me through the hill.\n        _Chorus._\n    If they catch you at your play,\n      Whip you merrily they will.\n\n    4\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlayful creatures grow not old;\n      Play is healthy nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pledge.\n    \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the dull heart gives the hold\n      For the point of trouble\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wedge.\n        _Chorus._\n    These reflections are as old\n      As the saws of rush and sedge.\n\n    5\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrisky lambkins in the grass,\n      Mint and pepper, if they spy,\n    Do they weep, and cry \u00e2\u0080\u0098alas!\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\n      Nay, but whisk their tails on high.\n        _Chorus._\n    Weep, indeed, and cry \u00e2\u0080\u0098alas!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n      Sooner you, than we or I.\n\n    6\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, how soon the shadows pass,\n      How the sun hath chased the gloom!\n    If our life is only grass--\n      Grass is where the flowers bloom.\n        _Chorus._\n    If we mainly live on grass,\n      Many a flower we consume.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd so may we leave them singing.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Alice Lorraine, by Richard Doddridge Blackmore\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE LORRAINE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 49075-0.txt or 49075-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/9\/0\/7\/49075\/\n\nProduced by Shaun Pinder and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net (This file was\nproduced from images generously made available by The\nInternet Archive)\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":696,"split":"train"}
