His older brother Billy rapes and kills an underage sex worker and is cornered by Thai police. Lieutenant Chang allows the girl's father, Choi Yan Lee, to beat Billy to death in the same room Billy killed the girl. Chang then cuts off the father's forearm for allowing his daughter to be a sex worker.\nJulian also engages in aberrant sexual practices. He prefers to be bonded as he watches his favorite prostitute, Mai, masturbate. Upon discovering his brother has been murdered, Julian and his crew go to Choi's kiosk to confront him. He decides to spare Choi's life after hearing about Chang's involvement. When Julian's mother, Crystal, arrives in Bangkok to identify Billy's corpse, she demands Julian find and kill the men responsible for Billy's death. He refuses\u00e2\u0080\u0094believing Choi was justified in avenging the death of his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0094infuriating Crystal. Fascinated by his sense of justice, Julian imagines meeting Chang in a dark room, where Chang cuts Julian's hands off.\nJulian brings Mai to meet Crystal, posing as his girlfriend. Crystal sees through the ruse, insulting Mai and demeaning Julian, pronouncing him to be sexually inferior to his dead brother. Julian is passive to Crystal's verbal abuse, but his aggravation results in in him viciously humiliating Mai afterwards. At Crystal's request, one of the fighters at Julian's boxing club assassinates Choi. Later, the police arrive at Julian's club, but Chang concludes that Julian is not Choi's killer. Julian recognises Chang from his visions and follows him from the boxing club, but Chang seems to disappear into thin air.\nAfter learning that Chang was involved in Billy's death, Crystal meets with an associate, Byron, to arrange Chang's assassination. Three gunmen on motorbikes are sent to kill Chang at a restaurant, which results in several customers and two of Chang's men being killed in a shoot-out. Chang kills two of the gunmen, follows the third on foot, and beats him with a frying pan. The surviving gunman leads Chang to his boss, Li Po, who has resorted to arranging assassination contracts as a means of providing for his crippled son. Chang then kills the gunman but spares Li Po after seeing his affection for his son. Li Po points Chang to Byron, who ordered the hit. Chang finds Byron in a club and tortures him to reveal the reasoning behind the hit.\nJulian confronts Chang and challenges him to a fight at Julian's boxing venue. Chang, an experienced boxer, quickly beats Julian, who does not land a single blow. Afterwards, Crystal tells Julian that Chang has figured out she ordered the hits. Fearful for her life, she pleads with Julian to kill Chang, the same way she asked Julian to kill his own father for her. She promises that after Julian kills Chang, they will go back home, and she will be a true mother to him.\nWith his associate Charlie Ling, Julian infiltrates Chang's home after shooting Chang's guard dead, intent on ambushing Chang when he returns. Charlie informs Julian that Crystal instructed him to execute Chang's entire family. Charlie murders the nanny of Chang's daughter as she enters the home, but Julian kills Charlie before he can murder Chang's young daughter.\nChang and a police officer find Crystal in the hotel she is staying at. She explains how Julian killed his father with his bare hands, asserting to Chang that Julian is violent and deranged, blaming him for the violent crimes committed in the family's name. Chang decides to punish her by cutting her throat. Later, Julian returns to the hotel and finds his mother's corpse. In silence, he approaches her body and cuts open her abdomen before placing his hand inside of the wound.\nJulian is later shown standing in a field with Chang, who appears to cut off both of Julian's hands with his sword. Finally Chang is singing at a karaoke bar to an audience of attentive police officers.\n<html>\n<head><title>Only God Forgives Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Only God Forgives script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Only God Forgives script, Only God Forgives movie script, Only God Forgives film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

That shuts everyone up and gets the Russian Criminals\n          up and ready for a confrontation. Half the bar's emptied by the\n          time Chang reaches Yuri Karkov.\n\n<b>                          YURI\n<\/b>           You better have a fucking good reason\n           for doing this.

Then a phone starts ringing in\n          Dimitri's jacket pocket (with a really cheesy ringtone). Dimitri\n          winces. Chang shakes his head.\n          Yuri pulls a gun. Kim shoots him dead.

Kim next to him along with a couple\n          of his crew. He looks incredibly calm.\n          The first bell sounds. Five second warning...\n          Chang looks over into the crowd. Kanita with Nadee. Kanita offers\n          him a 'thumbs up'. Chang smiles. Returns it.\n          Julian looks over. Sees Mai take a seat. She holds his gaze.\n          The second bell sounds. The first of five rounds. Julian and Chang\n          walk up to the centre of the ring. The Referee stands between\n          them. Brings them together. A quick look down to the Three Judges.\n          Then a look between the two fighters.\n          Julian eyes Chang. Steely determination in his eyes.

Julian moves in to attack\n          first. He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps\n          his left foot forward at the same time. Chang bends his right\n          leg, dodging the attack. He then pounces on the upper part of\n          Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his\n          left hand. He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's\n          too strong. This is a surprise for Chang. He breaks and steps\n          back.\n          Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an\n          attack on Chang's head. Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut,\n          connecting hard with Julian's chin. Julian moves back, dazed.\n          Takes a moment to get his bearings back. That hurt.\n          Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack. He hangs back.\n          Waiting for Julian to come at him again. This pisses Julian off.\n          He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot.\n          Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike\n          with a counter attack. He moves too slow. The right footed attack\n          was a feint. Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and\n          uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects\n          with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back.\n          Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards. He bounds\n          over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs\n          and punches to his upper body and face.\n          Chang's almost on the ropes. Julian comes in hard with kicks to\n          the shins with his right foot. Chang bends his body to pass under\n          Julian's right foot. Julian misses the target. Chang manages to\n          place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him\n          fall down.\n          Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make\n          the killer blow. He steps back to let him recover. Again this\n          enrages Julian.\n          He gets up and moves forward towards Chang. He comes in with a\n          high right kick. Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns\n          with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee. Julian swivels,\n          punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut. His guard's\n          down. But again no killer punch.\n\n<b>                          JULIAN\n<\/b>           Come on.\n          Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on.\n          Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take\n          out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one.\n          Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a\n          look of intense anger and frustration.\n\n<b>                          CUT TO:\n<\/b>\n<b>          INT.

Chang is reluctant to attack.\n          A waiting game... Who will strike first... Chang wins. Julian\n          moves to kick Chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as\n          he moves in. Chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own\n          kick as it comes in. Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels,\n          using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike\n          with his left foot. Chang goes flying backwards.\n          PICK OUT the look of concern etched on the faces of Nadee and\n          Kanita.\n          Chang recovers but Julian moves in fast with a series of punches\n          and elbows. Chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten.\n          He clings on to Julian to limit the damage.\n\n<b>                          REFEREE\n<\/b>\n<b>                          (IN THAI)\n<\/b>           Break.\n          The two fighters step back from each other.

Jenna watching with Gordon...\n          End of round: Julian feeling more confident. Again his eyes scan\n          the crowd. This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna.\n          Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner. Sees him staring\n          into the crowd. Looks over. Tries to see what he's looking at\n          but can't make it out.\n          POV from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian. When\n          she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the\n          fight - urging him to hit harder...\n          Jenna then walks back to Gordon...\n          On Chang. Deep in thought. He gets up early. Walks around the\n          ring. Looking into the crowd.\n          Jenna sees him. Stares at him. Suddenly nervous.\n          Everything slows down as Chang clocks her again. The colours of\n          the room change from blue to yellow to red. He's seen her and\n          she knows she's been seen. And he knows. And she knows that he\n          knows...\n          The bell goes off. Back to reality. Chang turns round. Too late.\n          He gets a massive blow to his head. He goes down hard.\n          The Referee starts counting.\n          Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful.\n          Jenna holds her breath.
