Rowland is a disgraced former US Navy officer. Now an alcoholic fallen to the lowest levels of society, he's been dismissed from the Navy and works as a deckhand on the Titan. One April night the ship hits an iceberg, sinking somewhat before the halfway point of the novel.\nThe second half follows Rowland. He saves the young daughter of a former lover by jumping onto the iceberg with her. The pair find a lifeboat washed up on the iceberg, and are eventually rescued by a passing ship. But the girl is recovered by her mother and Rowland is arrested for her kidnapping. A sympathetic magistrate discharges him and rebukes the mother for unsympathy to her daughter's savior. Rowland disappears from the world.\nIn a brief final chapter covering several years, Rowland works his way up from homeless and anonymous fisherman to a desk job and finally, two years after passing his civil service exam, to \"a lucrative position under the Government, and as he seated himself at the desk in his office, could have been heared to remark: 'Now John Rowland, your future is your own. You have merely suffered in the past from a mistaken estimate of the importance of women and whisky.' THE END\" (1898 edition at Google Books).\nA later edition includes a coda. Rowland receives a letter from the mother, who congratulates him and pleads for him to visit her, and the girl who begs for him.

On her bridge were\nofficers, who, besides being the pick of the Royal Navy, had passed\nrigid examinations in all studies that pertained to the winds, tides,\ncurrents, and geography of the sea; they were not only seamen, but\nscientists. The same professional standard applied to the personnel of\nthe engine-room, and the steward's department was equal to that of a\nfirst-class hotel.\n\nTwo brass bands, two orchestras, and a theatrical company entertained\nthe passengers during waking hours; a corps of physicians attended to\nthe temporal, and a corps of chaplains to the spiritual, welfare of all\non board, while a well-drilled fire-company soothed the fears of nervous\nones and added to the general entertainment by daily practice with their\napparatus.\n\nFrom her lofty bridge ran hidden telegraph lines to the bow, stern\nengine-room, crow's-nest on the foremast, and to all parts of the ship\nwhere work was done, each wire terminating in a marked dial with a\nmovable indicator, containing in its scope every order and answer\nrequired in handling the massive hulk, either at the dock or at\nsea--which eliminated, to a great extent, the hoarse, nerve-racking\nshouts of officers and sailors.\n\nFrom the bridge, engine-room, and a dozen places on her deck the\nninety-two doors of nineteen water-tight compartments could be closed in\nhalf a minute by turning a lever. These doors would also close\nautomatically in the presence of water. With nine compartments flooded\nthe ship would still float, and as no known accident of the sea could\npossibly fill this many, the steamship _Titan_ was considered\npractically unsinkable.\n\nBuilt of steel throughout, and for passenger traffic only, she carried\nno combustible cargo to threaten her destruction by fire; and the\nimmunity from the demand for cargo space had enabled her designers to\ndiscard the flat, kettle-bottom of cargo boats and give her the sharp\ndead-rise--or slant from the keel--of a steam yacht, and this improved\nher behavior in a seaway. She was eight hundred feet long, of seventy\nthousand tons' displacement, seventy-five thousand horse-power, and on\nher trial trip had steamed at a rate of twenty-five knots an hour over\nthe bottom, in the face of unconsidered winds, tides, and currents. In\nshort, she was a floating city--containing within her steel walls all\nthat tends to minimize the dangers and discomforts of the Atlantic\nvoyage--all that makes life enjoyable.\n\nUnsinkable--indestructible, she carried as few boats as would satisfy\nthe laws. These, twenty-four in number, were securely covered and lashed\ndown to their chocks on the upper deck, and if launched would hold five\nhundred people. She carried no useless, cumbersome life-rafts;\nbut--because the law required it--each of the three thousand berths in\nthe passengers', officers', and crew's quarters contained a cork jacket,\nwhile about twenty circular life-buoys were strewn along the rails.\n\nIn view of her absolute superiority to other craft, a rule of\nnavigation thoroughly believed in by some captains, but not yet openly\nfollowed, was announced by the steamship company to apply to the\n_Titan_: She would steam at full speed in fog, storm, and sunshine, and\non the Northern Lane Route, winter and summer, for the following good\nand substantial reasons: First, that if another craft should strike her,\nthe force of the impact would be distributed over a larger area if the\n_Titan_ had full headway, and the brunt of the damage would be borne by\nthe other. Second, that if the _Titan_ was the aggressor she would\ncertainly destroy the other craft, even at half-speed, and perhaps\ndamage her own bows; while at full speed, she would cut her in two with\nno more damage to herself than a paintbrush could remedy. In either\ncase, as the lesser of two evils, it was best that the smaller hull\nshould suffer. A third reason was that, at full speed, she could be more\neasily steered out of danger, and a fourth, that in case of an end-on\ncollision with an iceberg--the only thing afloat that she could not\nconquer--her bows would be crushed in but a few feet further at full\nthan at half speed, and at the most three compartments would be\nflooded--which would not matter with six more to spare.\n\nSo, it was confidently expected that when her engines had limbered\nthemselves, the steamship _Titan_ would land her passengers three\nthousand miles away with the promptitude and regularity of a railway\ntrain. She had beaten all records on her maiden voyage, but, up to the\nthird return trip, had not lowered the time between Sandy Hook and\nDaunt's Rock to the five-day limit; and it was unofficially rumored\namong the two thousand passengers who had embarked at New York that an\neffort would now be made to do so.\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nEight tugs dragged the great mass to midstream and pointed her nose down\nthe river; then the pilot on the bridge spoke a word or two; the first\nofficer blew a short blast on the whistle and turned a lever; the tugs\ngathered in their lines and drew off; down in the bowels of the ship\nthree small engines were started, opening the throttles of three large\nones; three propellers began to revolve; and the mammoth, with a\nvibratory tremble running through her great frame, moved slowly to sea.\n\nEast of Sandy Hook the pilot was dropped and the real voyage begun.\nFifty feet below her deck, in an inferno of noise, and heat, and light,\nand shadow, coal-passers wheeled the picked fuel from the bunkers to the\nfire-hold, where half-naked stokers, with faces like those of tortured\nfiends, tossed it into the eighty white-hot mouths of the furnaces. In\nthe engine-room, oilers passed to and fro, in and out of the plunging,\ntwisting, glistening steel, with oil-cans and waste, overseen by the\nwatchful staff on duty, who listened with strained hearing for a false\nnote in the confused jumble of sound--a clicking of steel out of tune,\nwhich would indicate a loosened key or nut. On deck, sailors set the\ntriangular sails on the two masts, to add their propulsion to the\nmomentum of the record-breaker, and the passengers dispersed themselves\nas suited their several tastes. Some were seated in steamer chairs, well\nwrapped--for, though it was April, the salt air was chilly--some paced\nthe deck, acquiring their sea legs; others listened to the orchestra in\nthe music-room, or read or wrote in the library, and a few took to their\nberths--seasick from the slight heave of the ship on the ground-swell.\n\nThe decks were cleared, watches set at noon, and then began the\nnever-ending cleaning-up at which steamship sailors put in so much of\ntheir time. Headed by a six-foot boatswain, a gang came aft on the\nstarboard side, with paint-buckets and brushes, and distributed\nthemselves along the rail.\n\n\"Davits an' stanchions, men--never mind the rail,\" said the boatswain.\n\"Ladies, better move your chairs back a little. Rowland, climb down out\no' that--you'll be overboard. Take a ventilator--no, you'll spill\npaint--put your bucket away an' get some sandpaper from the yeoman. Work\ninboard till you get it out o' you.\"\n\nThe sailor addressed--a slight-built man of about thirty, black-bearded\nand bronzed to the semblance of healthy vigor, but watery-eyed and\nunsteady of movement--came down from the rail and shambled forward with\nhis bucket. As he reached the group of ladies to whom the boatswain had\nspoken, his gaze rested on one--a sunny-haired young woman with the blue\nof the sea in her eyes--who had arisen at his approach. He started,\nturned aside as if to avoid her, and raising his hand in an embarrassed\nhalf-salute, passed on. Out of the boatswain's sight he leaned against\nthe deck-house and panted, while he held his hand to his breast.\n\n\"What is it?\" he muttered, wearily; \"whisky nerves, or the dying flutter\nof a starved love. Five years, now--and a look from her eyes can stop\nthe blood in my veins--can bring back all the heart-hunger and\nhelplessness, that leads a man to insanity--or this.\" He looked at his\ntrembling hand, all scarred and tar-stained, passed on forward, and\nreturned with the sandpaper.\n\nThe young woman had been equally affected by the meeting. An expression\nof mingled surprise and terror had come to her pretty, but rather weak\nface; and without acknowledging his half-salute, she had caught up a\nlittle child from the deck behind her, and turning into the saloon door,\nhurried to the library, where she sank into a chair beside a\nmilitary-looking gentleman, who glanced up from a book and remarked:\n\"Seen the sea-serpent, Myra, or the Flying Dutchman? What's up?\"\n\n\"Oh, George--no,\" she answered in agitated tones. \"John Rowland is\nhere--Lieutenant Rowland. I've just seen him--he is so changed--he tried\nto speak to me.\"\n\n\"Who--that troublesome flame of yours? I never met him, you know, and\nyou haven't told me much about him. What is he--first cabin?\"\n\n\"No, he seems to be a common sailor; he is working, and is dressed in\nold clothes--all dirty. And such a dissipated face, too. He seems to\nhave fallen--so low. And it is all since--\"\n\n\"Since you soured on him? Well, it is no fault of yours, dear. If a man\nhas it in him he'll go to the dogs anyhow. How is his sense of injury?\nHas he a grievance or a grudge? You're badly upset. What did he say?\"\n\n\"I don't know--he said nothing--I've always been afraid of him. I've met\nhim three times since then, and he puts such a frightful look in his\neyes--and he was so violent, and headstrong, and so terribly\nangry,--that time. He accused me of leading him on, and playing with\nhim; and he said something about an immutable law of chance, and a\ngoverning balance of events--that I couldn't understand, only where he\nsaid that for all the suffering we inflict on others, we receive an\nequal amount ourselves. Then he went away--in such a passion. I've\nimagined ever since that he would take some revenge--he might steal our\nMyra--our baby.\" She strained the smiling child to her breast and went\non. \"I liked him at first, until I found out that he was an\natheist--why, George, he actually denied the existence of God--and to\nme, a professing Christian.\"\n\n\"He had a wonderful nerve,\" said the husband, with a smile; \"didn't know\nyou very well, I should say.\"\n\n\"He never seemed the same to me after that,\" she resumed; \"I felt as\nthough in the presence of something unclean. Yet I thought how glorious\nit would be if I could save him to God, and tried to convince him of the\nloving care of Jesus; but he only ridiculed all I hold sacred, and said,\nthat much as he valued my good opinion, he would not be a hypocrite to\ngain it, and that he would be honest with himself and others, and\nexpress his honest unbelief--the idea; as though one could be honest\nwithout God's help--and then, one day, I smelled liquor on his\nbreath--he always smelled of tobacco--and I gave him up. It was then\nthat he--that he broke out.\"\n\n\"Come out and show me this reprobate,\" said the husband, rising. They\nwent to the door and the young woman peered out. \"He is the last man\ndown there--close to the cabin,\" she said as she drew in. The husband\nstepped out.\n\n\"What! that hang-dog ruffian, scouring the ventilator? So, that's\nRowland, of the navy, is it! Well, this is a tumble. Wasn't he broken\nfor conduct unbecoming an officer? Got roaring drunk at the President's\nlevee, didn't he? I think I read of it.\"\n\n\"I know he lost his position and was terribly disgraced,\" answered the\nwife.\n\n\"Well, Myra, the poor devil is harmless now. We'll be across in a few\ndays, and you needn't meet him on this broad deck. If he hasn't lost all\nsensibility, he's as embarrassed as you. Better stay in now--it's\ngetting foggy.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nWhen the watch turned out at midnight, they found a vicious half-gale\nblowing from the northeast, which, added to the speed of the steamship,\nmade, so far as effects on her deck went, a fairly uncomfortable whole\ngale of chilly wind. The head sea, choppy as compared with her great\nlength, dealt the _Titan_ successive blows, each one attended by\nsupplementary tremors to the continuous vibrations of the engines--each\none sending a cloud of thick spray aloft that reached the crow's-nest on\nthe foremast and battered the pilot-house windows on the bridge in a\nliquid bombardment that would have broken ordinary glass. A fog-bank,\ninto which the ship had plunged in the afternoon, still enveloped\nher--damp and impenetrable; and into the gray, ever-receding wall ahead,\nwith two deck officers and three lookouts straining sight and hearing to\nthe utmost, the great racer was charging with undiminished speed.\n\nAt a quarter past twelve, two men crawled in from the darkness at the\nends of the eighty-foot bridge and shouted to the first officer, who had\njust taken the deck, the names of the men who had relieved them. Backing\nup to the pilot-house, the officer repeated the names to a quartermaster\nwithin, who entered them in the log-book. Then the men vanished--to\ntheir coffee and \"watch-below.\" In a few moments another dripping shape\nappeared on the bridge and reported the crow's-nest relief.\n\n\"Rowland, you say?\" bawled the officer above the howling of the wind.\n\"Is he the man who was lifted aboard, drunk, yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Is he still drunk?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"All right--that'll do. Enter Rowland in the crow's-nest,\nquartermaster,\" said the officer; then, making a funnel of his hands, he\nroared out: \"Crow's-nest, there.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" came the answer, shrill and clear on the gale.\n\n\"Keep your eyes open--keep a sharp lookout.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Been a man-o'-war's-man, I judge, by his answer. They're no good,\"\nmuttered the officer. He resumed his position at the forward side of the\nbridge where the wooden railing afforded some shelter from the raw wind,\nand began the long vigil which would only end when the second officer\nrelieved him, four hours later. Conversation--except in the line of\nduty--was forbidden among the bridge officers of the _Titan_, and his\nwatchmate, the third officer, stood on the other side of the large\nbridge binnacle, only leaving this position occasionally to glance in at\nthe compass--which seemed to be his sole duty at sea. Sheltered by one\nof the deck-houses below, the boatswain and the watch paced back and\nforth, enjoying the only two hours respite which steamship rules\nafforded, for the day's work had ended with the going down of the other\nwatch, and at two o'clock the washing of the 'tween-deck would begin, as\nan opening task in the next day's labor.\n\nBy the time one bell had sounded, with its repetition from the\ncrow's-nest, followed by a long-drawn cry--\"all's well\"--from the\nlookouts, the last of the two thousand passengers had retired, leaving\nthe spacious cabins and steerage in possession of the watchmen; while,\nsound asleep in his cabin abaft the chart-room was the captain, the\ncommander who never commanded--unless the ship was in danger; for the\npilot had charge, making and leaving port, and the officers, at sea.\n\nTwo bells were struck and answered; then three, and the boatswain and\nhis men were lighting up for a final smoke, when there rang out overhead\na startling cry from the crow's-nest:\n\n\"Something ahead, sir--can't make it out.\"\n\nThe first officer sprang to the engine-room telegraph and grasped the\nlever. \"Sing out what you see,\" he roared.\n\n\"Hard aport, sir--ship on the starboard tack--dead ahead,\" came the cry.\n\n\"Port your wheel--hard over,\" repeated the first officer to the\nquartermaster at the helm--who answered and obeyed. Nothing as yet could\nbe seen from the bridge. The powerful steering-engine in the stern\nground the rudder over; but before three degrees on the compass card\nwere traversed by the lubber's-point, a seeming thickening of the\ndarkness and fog ahead resolved itself into the square sails of a\ndeep-laden ship, crossing the _Titan's_ bow, not half her length away.\n\n\"H--l and d--\" growled the first officer. \"Steady on your course,\nquartermaster,\" he shouted. \"Stand from under on deck.\" He turned a\nlever which closed compartments, pushed a button marked--\"Captain's\nRoom,\" and crouched down, awaiting the crash.\n\nThere was hardly a crash. A slight jar shook the forward end of the\n_Titan_ and sliding down her fore-topmast-stay and rattling on deck came\na shower of small spars, sails, blocks, and wire rope. Then, in the\ndarkness to starboard and port, two darker shapes shot by--the two\nhalves of the ship she had cut through; and from one of these shapes,\nwhere still burned a binnacle light, was heard, high above the confused\nmurmur of shouts and shrieks, a sailorly voice:\n\n\"May the curse of God light on you and your cheese-knife, you\nbrass-bound murderers.\"\n\nThe shapes were swallowed in the blackness astern; the cries were hushed\nby the clamor of the gale, and the steamship _Titan_ swung back to her\ncourse. The first officer had not turned the lever of the engine-room\ntelegraph.\n\nThe boatswain bounded up the steps of the bridge for instructions.\n\n\"Put men at the hatches and doors. Send every one who comes on deck to\nthe chart-room. Tell the watchman to notice what the passengers have\nlearned, and clear away that wreck forward as soon as possible.\" The\nvoice of the officer was hoarse and strained as he gave these\ndirections, and the \"aye, aye, sir\" of the boatswain was uttered in a\ngasp.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe crow's-nest \"lookout,\" sixty feet above the deck, had seen every\ndetail of the horror, from the moment when the upper sails of the doomed\nship had appeared to him above the fog to the time when the last tangle\nof wreckage was cut away by his watchmates below. When relieved at four\nbells, he descended with as little strength in his limbs as was\ncompatible with safety in the rigging. At the rail, the boatswain met\nhim.\n\n\"Report your relief, Rowland,\" he said, \"and go into the chart-room!\"\n\nOn the bridge, as he gave the name of his successor, the first officer\nseized his hand, pressed it, and repeated the boatswain's order. In the\nchart-room, he found the captain of the _Titan_, pale-faced and intense\nin manner, seated at a table, and, grouped around him, the whole of the\nwatch on deck except the officers, lookouts, and quartermasters. The\ncabin watchmen were there, and some of the watch below, among whom were\nstokers and coal-passers, and also, a few of the idlers--lampmen,\nyeomen, and butchers, who, sleeping forward, had been awakened by the\nterrific blow of the great hollow knife within which they lived.\n\nThree carpenters' mates stood by the door, with sounding-rods in their\nhands, which they had just shown the captain--dry. Every face, from the\ncaptain's down, wore a look of horror and expectancy. A quartermaster\nfollowed Rowland in and said:\n\n\"Engineer felt no jar in the engine-room, sir; and there's no excitement\nin the stokehold.\"\n\n\"And you watchmen report no alarm in the cabins. How about the steerage?\nIs that man back?\" asked the captain. Another watchman appeared as he\nspoke.\n\n\"All asleep in the steerage, sir,\" he said. Then a quartermaster entered\nwith the same report of the forecastles.\n\n\"Very well,\" said the captain, rising; \"one by one come into my\noffice--watchmen first, then petty officers, then the men.\nQuartermasters will watch the door--that no man goes out until I have\nseen him.\" He passed into another room, followed by a watchman, who\npresently emerged and went on deck with a more pleasant expression of\nface. Another entered and came out; then another, and another, until\nevery man but Rowland had been within the sacred precincts, all to wear\nthe same pleased, or satisfied, look on reappearing. When Rowland\nentered, the captain, seated at a desk, motioned him to a chair, and\nasked his name.\n\n\"John Rowland,\" he answered. The captain wrote it down.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said, \"that you were in the crow's-nest when this\nunfortunate collision occurred.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; and I reported the ship as soon as I saw her.\"\n\n\"You are not here to be censured. You are aware, of course, that nothing\ncould be done, either to avert this terrible calamity, or to save life\nafterward.\"\n\n\"Nothing at a speed of twenty-five knots an hour in a thick fog, sir.\"\nThe captain glanced sharply at Rowland and frowned.\n\n\"We will not discuss the speed of the ship, my good man,\" he said, \"or\nthe rules of the company. You will find, when you are paid at Liverpool,\na package addressed to you at the company's office containing one\nhundred pounds in banknotes. This, you will receive for your silence in\nregard to this collision--the reporting of which would embarrass the\ncompany and help no one.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, captain, I shall not receive it. On the contrary, sir,\nI shall speak of this wholesale murder at the first opportunity!\"\n\nThe captain leaned back and stared at the debauched face, the trembling\nfigure of the sailor, with which this defiant speech so little accorded.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, he would have sent him on deck to be dealt\nwith by the officers. But this was not an ordinary circumstance. In the\nwatery eyes was a look of shock, and horror, and honest indignation; the\naccents were those of an educated man; and the consequences hanging over\nhimself and the company for which he worked--already complicated by and\ninvolved in his efforts to avoid them--which this man might precipitate,\nwere so extreme, that such questions as insolence and difference in rank\nwere not to be thought of. He must meet and subdue this Tartar on common\nground--as man to man.\n\n\"Are you aware, Rowland,\" he asked, quietly, \"that you will stand\nalone--that you will be discredited, lose your berth, and make enemies?\"\n\n\"I am aware of more than that,\" answered Rowland, excitedly. \"I know of\nthe power vested in you as captain. I know that you can order me into\nirons from this room for any offense you wish to imagine. And I know\nthat an unwitnessed, uncorroborated entry in your official log\nconcerning me would be evidence enough to bring me life imprisonment.\nBut I also know something of admiralty law; that from my prison cell I\ncan send you and your first officer to the gallows.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken in your conceptions of evidence. I could not cause\nyour conviction by a log-book entry; nor could you, from a prison,\ninjure me. What are you, may I ask--an ex-lawyer?\"\n\n\"A graduate of Annapolis. Your equal in professional technic.\"\n\n\"And you have interest at Washington?\"\n\n\"None whatever.\"\n\n\"And what is your object in taking this stand--which can do you no\npossible good, though certainly not the harm you speak of?\"\n\n\"That I may do one good, strong act in my useless life--that I may help\nto arouse such a sentiment of anger in the two countries as will forever\nend this wanton destruction of life and property for the sake of\nspeed--that will save the hundreds of fishing-craft, and others, run\ndown yearly, to their owners, and the crews to their families.\"\n\nBoth men had risen and the captain was pacing the floor as Rowland, with\nflashing eyes and clinched fists, delivered this declaration.\n\n\"A result to be hoped for, Rowland,\" said the former, pausing before\nhim, \"but beyond your power or mine to accomplish. Is the amount I named\nlarge enough? Could you fill a position on my bridge?\"\n\n\"I can fill a higher; and your company is not rich enough to buy me.\"\n\n\"You seem to be a man without ambition; but you must have wants.\"\n\n\"Food, clothing, shelter--and whisky,\" said Rowland with a bitter,\nself-contemptuous laugh. The captain reached down a decanter and two\nglasses from a swinging tray and said as he placed them before him:\n\n\"Here is one of your wants; fill up.\" Rowland's eyes glistened as he\npoured out a glassful, and the captain followed.\n\n\"I will drink with you, Rowland,\" he said; \"here is to our better\nunderstanding.\" He tossed off the liquor; then Rowland, who had waited,\nsaid: \"I prefer drinking alone, captain,\" and drank the whisky at a\ngulp. The captain's face flushed at the affront, but he controlled\nhimself.\n\n\"Go on deck, now, Rowland,\" he said; \"I will talk with you again before\nwe reach soundings. Meanwhile, I request--not require, but request--that\nyou hold no useless conversation with your shipmates in regard to this\nmatter.\"\n\nTo the first officer, when relieved at eight bells, the captain said:\n\"He is a broken-down wreck with a temporarily active conscience; but is\nnot the man to buy or intimidate: he knows too much. However, we've\nfound his weak point. If he gets snakes before we dock, his testimony is\nworthless. Fill him up and I'll see the surgeon, and study up on drugs.\"\n\nWhen Rowland turned out to breakfast at seven bells that morning, he\nfound a pint flask in the pocket of his pea-jacket, which he felt of but\ndid not pull out in sight of his watchmates.\n\n\"Well, captain,\" he thought, \"you are, in truth, about as puerile,\ninsipid a scoundrel as ever escaped the law. I'll save you your drugged\nDutch courage for evidence.\" But it was not drugged, as he learned\nlater. It was good whisky--a leader--to warm his stomach while the\ncaptain was studying.\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nAn incident occurred that morning which drew Rowland's thoughts far from\nthe happenings of the night. A few hours of bright sunshine had brought\nthe passengers on deck like bees from a hive, and the two broad\npromenades resembled, in color and life, the streets of a city. The\nwatch was busy at the inevitable scrubbing, and Rowland, with a swab and\nbucket, was cleaning the white paint on the starboard taffrail, screened\nfrom view by the after deck-house, which shut off a narrow space at the\nstern. A little girl ran into the inclosure, laughing and screaming, and\nclung to his legs, while she jumped up and down in an overflow of\nspirits.\n\n\"I wunned 'way,\" she said; \"I wunned 'way from mamma.\"\n\nDrying his wet hands on his trousers, Rowland lifted the tot and said,\ntenderly: \"Well, little one, you must run back to mamma. You're in bad\ncompany.\" The innocent eyes smiled into his own, and then--a foolish\nproceeding, which only bachelors are guilty of--he held her above the\nrail in jesting menace. \"Shall I drop you over to the fishes, baby?\" he\nasked, while his features softened to an unwonted smile. The child gave\na little scream of fright, and at that instant a young woman appeared\naround the corner. She sprang toward Rowland like a tigress, snatched\nthe child, stared at him for a moment with dilated eyes, and then\ndisappeared, leaving him limp and nerveless, breathing hard.\n\n\"It is her child,\" he groaned. \"That was the mother-look. She is\nmarried--married.\" He resumed his work, with a face as near the color of\nthe paint he was scrubbing as the tanned skin of a sailor may become.\n\nTen minutes later, the captain, in his office, was listening to a\ncomplaint from a very excited man and woman.\n\n\"And you say, colonel,\" said the captain, \"that this man Rowland is an\nold enemy?\"\n\n\"He is--or was once--a rejected admirer of Mrs. Selfridge. That is all I\nknow of him--except that he has hinted at revenge. My wife is certain of\nwhat she saw, and I think the man should be confined.\"\n\n\"Why, captain,\" said the woman, vehemently, as she hugged her child,\n\"you should have seen him; he was just about to drop Myra over as I\nseized her--and he had such a frightful leer on his face, too. Oh, it\nwas hideous. I shall not sleep another wink in this ship--I know.\"\n\n\"I beg you will give yourself no uneasiness, madam,\" said the captain,\ngravely. \"I have already learned something of his antecedents--that he\nis a disgraced and broken-down naval officer; but, as he has sailed\nthree voyages with us, I had credited his willingness to work\nbefore-the-mast to his craving for liquor, which he could not satisfy\nwithout money. However--as you think--he may be following you. Was he\nable to learn of your movements--that you were to take passage in this\nship?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" exclaimed the husband; \"he must know some of Mrs. Selfridge's\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said, eagerly; \"I have heard him spoken of, several\ntimes.\"\n\n\"Then it is clear,\" said the captain. \"If you will agree, madam, to\ntestify against him in the English courts, I will immediately put him in\nirons for attempted murder.\"\n\n\"Oh, do, captain,\" she exclaimed. \"I cannot feel safe while he is at\nliberty. Of course I will testify.\"\n\n\"Whatever you do, captain,\" said the husband, savagely, \"rest assured\nthat I shall put a bullet through his head if he meddles with me or mine\nagain. Then you can put me in irons.\"\n\n\"I will see that he is attended to, colonel,\" replied the captain as he\nbowed them out of his office.\n\nBut, as a murder charge is not always the best way to discredit a man;\nand as the captain did not believe that the man who had defied him would\nmurder a child; and as the charge would be difficult to prove in any\ncase, and would cause him much trouble and annoyance, he did not order\nthe arrest of John Rowland, but merely directed that, for the time, he\nshould be kept at work by day in the 'tween-deck, out of sight of the\npassengers.\n\nRowland, surprised at his sudden transfer from the disagreeable\nscrubbing to a \"soldier's job\" of painting life-buoys in the warm\n'tween-deck, was shrewd enough to know that he was being closely watched\nby the boatswain that morning, but not shrewd enough to affect any\nsymptoms of intoxication or drugging, which might have satisfied his\nanxious superiors and brought him more whisky. As a result of his\nbrighter eyes and steadier voice--due to the curative sea air--when he\nturned out for the first dog-watch on deck at four o'clock, the captain\nand boatswain held an interview in the chart-room, in which the former\nsaid: \"Do not be alarmed. It is not poison. He is half-way into the\nhorrors now, and this will merely bring them on. He will see snakes,\nghosts, goblins, shipwrecks, fire, and all sorts of things. It works in\ntwo or three hours. Just drop it into his drinking pot while the port\nforecastle is empty.\"\n\nThere was a fight in the port forecastle--to which Rowland belonged--at\nsupper-time, which need not be described beyond mention of the fact that\nRowland, who was not a participant, had his pot of tea dashed from his\nhand before he had taken three swallows. He procured a fresh supply and\nfinished his supper; then, taking no part in his watchmates' open\ndiscussion of the fight, and guarded discussion of collisions, rolled\ninto his bunk and smoked until eight bells, when he turned out with the\nrest.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\"Rowland,\" said the big boatswain, as the watch mustered on deck; \"take\nthe starboard bridge lookout.\"\n\n\"It is not my trick, boats'n,\" said Rowland, in surprise.\n\n\"Orders from the bridge. Get up there.\"\n\nRowland grumbled, as sailors may when aggrieved, and obeyed. The man he\nrelieved reported his name, and disappeared; the first officer sauntered\ndown the bridge, uttered the official, \"keep a good lookout,\" and\nreturned to his post; then the silence and loneliness of a night-watch\nat sea, intensified by the never-ceasing hum of the engines, and\nrelieved only by the sounds of distant music and laughter from the\ntheater, descended on the forward part of the ship. For the fresh\nwesterly wind, coming with the _Titan_, made nearly a calm on her deck;\nand the dense fog, though overshone by a bright star-specked sky, was so\nchilly that the last talkative passenger had fled to the light and life\nwithin.\n\nWhen three bells--half-past nine--had sounded, and Rowland had given in\nhis turn the required call--\"all's well\"--the first officer left his\npost and approached him.\n\n\"Rowland,\" he said as he drew near; \"I hear you've walked the\nquarter-deck.\"\n\n\"I cannot imagine how you learned it, sir,\" replied Rowland; \"I am not\nin the habit of referring to it.\"\n\n\"You told the captain. I suppose the curriculum is as complete at\nAnnapolis as at the Royal Naval College. What do you think of Maury's\ntheories of currents?\"\n\n\"They seem plausible,\" said Rowland, unconsciously dropping the \"sir\";\n\"but I think that in most particulars he has been proven wrong.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so myself. Did you ever follow up another idea of\nhis--that of locating the position of ice in a fog by the rate of\ndecrease in temperature as approached?\"\n\n\"Not to any definite result. But it seems to be only a matter of\ncalculation, and time to calculate. Cold is negative heat, and can be\ntreated like radiant energy, decreasing as the square of the distance.\"\n\nThe officer stood a moment, looking ahead and humming a tune to himself;\nthen, saying: \"Yes, that's so,\" returned to his place.\n\n\"Must have a cast-iron stomach,\" he muttered, as he peered into the\nbinnacle; \"or else the boats'n dosed the wrong man's pot.\"\n\nRowland glanced after the retreating officer with a cynical smile. \"I\nwonder,\" he said to himself, \"why he comes down here talking navigation\nto a foremast hand. Why am I up here--out of my turn? Is this something\nin line with that bottle?\" He resumed the short pacing back and forth on\nthe end of the bridge, and the rather gloomy train of thought which the\nofficer had interrupted.\n\n\"How long,\" he mused, \"would his ambition and love of profession last\nhim after he had met, and won, and lost, the only woman on earth to him?\nWhy is it--that failure to hold the affections of one among the\nmillions of women who live, and love, can outweigh every blessing in\nlife, and turn a man's nature into a hell, to consume him? Who did she\nmarry? Some one, probably a stranger long after my banishment, who came\nto her possessed of a few qualities of mind or physique that pleased\nher,--who did not need to love her--his chances were better without\nthat--and he steps coolly and easily into my heaven. And they tell us,\nthat 'God doeth all things well,' and that there is a heaven where all\nour unsatisfied wants are attended to--provided we have the necessary\nfaith in it. That means, if it means anything, that after a lifetime of\nunrecognized allegiance, during which I win nothing but her fear and\ncontempt, I may be rewarded by the love and companionship of her soul.\nDo I love her soul? Has her soul beauty of face and the figure and\ncarriage of a Venus? Has her soul deep, blue eyes and a sweet, musical\nvoice? Has it wit, and grace, and charm? Has it a wealth of pity for\nsuffering? These are the things I loved. I do not love her soul, if she\nhas one. I do not want it. I want her--I need her.\" He stopped in his\nwalk and leaned against the bridge railing, with eyes fixed on the fog\nahead. He was speaking his thoughts aloud now, and the first officer\ndrew within hearing, listened a moment, and went back. \"Working on him,\"\nhe whispered to the third officer. Then he pushed the button which\ncalled the captain, blew a short blast of the steam whistle as a call to\nthe boatswain, and resumed his watch on the drugged lookout, while the\nthird officer conned the ship.\n\nThe steam call to the boatswain is so common a sound on a steamship as\nto generally pass unnoticed. This call affected another besides the\nboatswain. A little night-gowned figure arose from an under berth in a\nsaloon stateroom, and, with wide-open, staring eyes, groped its way to\nthe deck, unobserved by the watchman. The white, bare little feet felt\nno cold as they pattered the planks of the deserted promenade, and the\nlittle figure had reached the steerage entrance by the time the captain\nand boatswain had reached the bridge.\n\n\"And they talk,\" went on Rowland, as the three watched and listened; \"of\nthe wonderful love and care of a merciful God, who controls all\nthings--who has given me my defects, and my capacity for loving, and\nthen placed Myra Gaunt in my way. Is there mercy to me in this? As part\nof a great evolutionary principle, which develops the race life at the\nexpense of the individual, it might be consistent with the idea of a\nGod--a first cause. But does the individual who perishes, because\nunfitted to survive, owe any love, or gratitude to this God? He does\nnot! On the supposition that He exists, I deny it! And on the complete\nlack of evidence that He does exist, I affirm to myself the integrity of\ncause and effect--which is enough to explain the Universe, and me. A\nmerciful God--a kind, loving, just, and merciful God--\" he burst into a\nfit of incongruous laughter, which stopped short as he clapped his hands\nto his stomach and then to his head. \"What ails me?\" he gasped; \"I feel\nas though I had swallowed hot coals--and my head--and my eyes--I can't\nsee.\" The pain left him in a moment and the laughter returned. \"What's\nwrong with the starboard anchor? It's moving. It's changing. It's\na--what? What on earth is it? On end--and the windlass--and the spare\nanchors--and the davits--all alive--all moving.\"\n\nThe sight he saw would have been horrid to a healthy mind, but it only\nmoved this man to increased and uncontrollable merriment. The two rails\nbelow leading to the stem had arisen before him in a shadowy triangle;\nand within it were the deck-fittings he had mentioned. The windlass had\nbecome a thing of horror, black and forbidding. The two end barrels were\nthe bulging, lightless eyes of a non-descript monster, for which the\ncable chains had multiplied themselves into innumerable legs and\ntentacles. And this thing was crawling around within the triangle. The\nanchor-davits were many-headed serpents which danced on their tails, and\nthe anchors themselves writhed and squirmed in the shape of immense\nhairy caterpillars, while faces appeared on the two white\nlantern-towers--grinning and leering at him. With his hands on the\nbridge rail, and tears streaming down his face, he laughed at the\nstrange sight, but did not speak; and the three, who had quietly\napproached, drew back to await, while below on the promenade deck, the\nlittle white figure, as though attracted by his laughter, turned into\nthe stairway leading to the upper deck.\n\nThe phantasmagoria faded to a blank wall of gray fog, and Rowland found\nsanity to mutter, \"They've drugged me\"; but in an instant he stood in\nthe darkness of a garden--one that he had known. In the distance were\nthe lights of a house, and close to him was a young girl, who turned\nfrom him and fled, even as he called to her.\n\nBy a supreme effort of will, he brought himself back to the present, to\nthe bridge he stood upon, and to his duty. \"Why must it haunt me through\nthe years?\" he groaned; \"drunk then--drunk since. She could have saved\nme, but she chose to damn me.\" He strove to pace up and down, but\nstaggered, and clung to the rail; while the three watchers approached\nagain, and the little white figure below climbed the upper bridge steps.\n\n\"The survival of the fittest,\" he rambled, as he stared into the fog;\n\"cause and effect. It explains the Universe--and me.\" He lifted his hand\nand spoke loudly, as though to some unseen familiar of the deep. \"What\nwill be the last effect? Where in the scheme of ultimate balance--under\nthe law of the correlation of energy, will my wasted wealth of love be\ngathered, and weighed, and credited? What will balance it, and where\nwill I be? Myra,--Myra,\" he called; \"do you know what you have lost? Do\nyou know, in your goodness, and purity, and truth, of what you have\ndone? Do you know--\"\n\nThe fabric on which he stood was gone, and he seemed to be poised on\nnothing in a worldless universe of gray--alone. And in the vast,\nlimitless emptiness there was no sound, or life, or change; and in his\nheart neither fear, nor wonder, nor emotion of any kind, save one--the\nunspeakable hunger of a love that had failed. Yet it seemed that he was\nnot John Rowland, but some one, or something else; for presently he saw\nhimself, far away--millions of billions of miles; as though on the\noutermost fringes of the void--and heard his own voice, calling.\nFaintly, yet distinctly, filled with the concentrated despair of his\nlife, came the call: \"Myra,--Myra.\"\n\nThere was an answering call, and looking for the second voice, he beheld\nher--the woman of his love--on the opposite edge of space; and her eyes\nheld the tenderness, and her voice held the pleading that he had known\nbut in dreams. \"Come back,\" she called; \"come back to me.\" But it seemed\nthat the two could not understand; for again he heard the despairing\ncry: \"Myra, Myra, where are you?\" and again the answer: \"Come back.\nCome.\"\n\nThen in the far distance to the right appeared a faint point of flame,\nwhich grew larger. It was approaching, and he dispassionately viewed it;\nand when he looked again for the two, they were gone, and in their\nplaces were two clouds of nebula, which resolved into myriad points of\nsparkling light and color--whirling, encroaching, until they filled all\nspace. And through them the larger light was coming--and growing\nlarger--straight for him.\n\nHe heard a rushing sound, and looking for it, saw in the opposite\ndirection a formless object, as much darker than the gray of the void as\nthe flame was brighter, and it too was growing larger, and coming. And\nit seemed to him that this light and darkness were the good and evil of\nhis life, and he watched, to see which would reach him first, but felt\nno surprise or regret when he saw that the darkness was nearest. It\ncame, closer and closer, until it brushed him on the side.\n\n\"What have we here, Rowland?\" said a voice. Instantly, the whirling\npoints were blotted out; the universe of gray changed to the fog; the\nflame of light to the moon rising above it, and the shapeless darkness\nto the form of the first officer. The little white figure, which had\njust darted past the three watchers, stood at his feet. As though warned\nby an inner subconsciousness of danger, it had come in its sleep, for\nsafety and care, to its mother's old lover--the strong and the weak--the\ndegraded and disgraced, but exalted--the persecuted, drugged, and all\nbut helpless John Rowland.\n\nWith the readiness with which a man who dozes while standing will answer\nthe question that wakens him, he said--though he stammered from the now\nwaning effect of the drug: \"Myra's child, sir; it's asleep.\" He picked\nup the night-gowned little girl, who screamed as she wakened, and folded\nhis pea-jacket around the cold little body.\n\n\"Who is Myra?\" asked the officer in a bullying tone, in which were also\nchagrin and disappointment. \"You've been asleep yourself.\"\n\nBefore Rowland could reply a shout from the crow's-nest split the air.\n\n\"Ice,\" yelled the lookout; \"ice ahead. Iceberg. Right under the bows.\"\nThe first officer ran amidships, and the captain, who had remained\nthere, sprang to the engine-room telegraph, and this time the lever was\nturned. But in five seconds the bow of the _Titan_ began to lift, and\nahead, and on either hand, could be seen, through the fog, a field of\nice, which arose in an incline to a hundred feet high in her track. The\nmusic in the theater ceased, and among the babel of shouts and cries,\nand the deafening noise of steel, scraping and crashing over ice,\nRowland heard the agonized voice of a woman crying from the bridge\nsteps: \"Myra--Myra, where are you? Come back.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nSeventy-five thousand tons--dead-weight--rushing through the fog at the\nrate of fifty feet a second, had hurled itself at an iceberg. Had the\nimpact been received by a perpendicular wall, the elastic resistance of\nbending plates and frames would have overcome the momentum with no more\ndamage to the passengers than a severe shaking up, and to the ship than\nthe crushing in of her bows and the killing, to a man, of the watch\nbelow. She would have backed off, and, slightly down by the head,\nfinished the voyage at reduced speed, to rebuild on insurance money, and\nbenefit, largely, in the end, by the consequent advertising of her\nindestructibility. But a low beach, possibly formed by the recent\noverturning of the berg, received the _Titan_, and with her keel cutting\nthe ice like the steel runner of an ice-boat, and her great weight\nresting on the starboard bilge, she rose out of the sea, higher and\nhigher--until the propellers in the stern were half exposed--then,\nmeeting an easy, spiral rise in the ice under her port bow, she heeled,\noverbalanced, and crashed down on her side, to starboard.\n\nThe holding-down bolts of twelve boilers and three triple-expansion\nengines, unintended to hold such weights from a perpendicular flooring,\nsnapped, and down through a maze of ladders, gratings, and fore-and-aft\nbulkheads came these giant masses of steel and iron, puncturing the\nsides of the ship, even where backed by solid, resisting ice; and\nfilling the engine- and boiler-rooms with scalding steam, which brought\na quick, though tortured death, to each of the hundred men on duty in\nthe engineer's department.\n\nAmid the roar of escaping steam, and the bee-like buzzing of nearly\nthree thousand human voices, raised in agonized screams and callings\nfrom within the inclosing walls, and the whistling of air through\nhundreds of open deadlights as the water, entering the holes of the\ncrushed and riven starboard side, expelled it, the _Titan_ moved slowly\nbackward and launched herself into the sea, where she floated low on her\nside--a dying monster, groaning with her death-wound.\n\nA solid, pyramid-like hummock of ice, left to starboard as the steamer\nascended, and which projected close alongside the upper, or boat-deck,\nas she fell over, had caught, in succession, every pair of davits to\nstarboard, bending and wrenching them, smashing boats, and snapping\ntackles and gripes, until, as the ship cleared herself, it capped the\npile of wreckage strewing the ice in front of, and around it, with the\nend and broken stanchions of the bridge. And in this shattered, box-like\nstructure, dazed by the sweeping fall through an arc of seventy-foot\nradius, crouched Rowland, bleeding from a cut in his head, and still\nholding to his breast the little girl--now too frightened to cry.\n\nBy an effort of will, he aroused himself and looked. To his eyesight,\ntwisted and fixed to a shorter focus by the drug he had taken, the\nsteamship was little more than a blotch on the moon-whitened fog; yet he\nthought he could see men clambering and working on the upper davits, and\nthe nearest boat--No. 24--seemed to be swinging by the tackles. Then the\nfog shut her out, though her position was still indicated by the roaring\nof steam from her iron lungs. This ceased in time, leaving behind it the\nhorrid humming sound and whistling of air; and when this too was\nsuddenly hushed, and the ensuing silence broken by dull, booming\nreports--as from bursting compartments--Rowland knew that the holocaust\nwas complete; that the invincible _Titan_, with nearly all of her\npeople, unable to climb vertical floors and ceilings, was beneath the\nsurface of the sea.\n\nMechanically, his benumbed faculties had received and recorded the\nimpressions of the last few moments; he could not comprehend, to the\nfull, the horror of it all. Yet his mind was keenly alive to the peril\nof the woman whose appealing voice he had heard and recognized--the\nwoman of his dream, and the mother of the child in his arms. He hastily\nexamined the wreckage. Not a boat was intact. Creeping down to the\nwater's edge, he hailed, with all the power of his weak voice, to\npossible, but invisible boats beyond the fog--calling on them to come\nand save the child--to look out for a woman who had been on deck, under\nthe bridge. He shouted this woman's name--the one that he\nknew--encouraging her to swim, to tread water, to float on wreckage, and\nto answer him, until he came to her. There was no response, and when his\nvoice had grown hoarse and futile, and his feet numb from the cold of\nthe thawing ice, he returned to the wreckage, weighed down and all but\ncrushed by the blackest desolation that had, so far, come into his\nunhappy life. The little girl was crying and he tried to soothe her.\n\n\"I want mamma,\" she wailed.\n\n\"Hush, baby, hush,\" he answered, wearily and bitterly; \"so do I--more\nthan Heaven, but I think our chances are about even now. Are you cold,\nlittle one? We'll go inside, and I'll make a house for us.\"\n\nHe removed his coat, tenderly wrapped the little figure in it, and with\nthe injunction: \"Don't be afraid, now,\" placed her in the corner of the\nbridge, which rested on its forward side. As he did so, the bottle of\nwhisky fell out of the pocket. It seemed an age since he had found it\nthere, and it required a strong effort of reasoning before he remembered\nits full significance. Then he raised it, to hurl it down the incline of\nice, but stopped himself.\n\n\"I'll keep it,\" he muttered; \"it may be safe in small quantities, and\nwe'll need it on this ice.\" He placed it in a corner; then, removing the\ncanvas cover from one of the wrecked boats, he hung it over the open\nside and end of the bridge, crawled within, and donned his coat--a\nready-made, slop-chest garment, designed for a larger man--and buttoning\nit around himself and the little girl, lay down on the hard woodwork.\nShe was still crying, but soon, under the influence of the warmth of his\nbody, ceased and went to sleep.\n\nHuddled in a corner, he gave himself up to the torment of his thoughts.\nTwo pictures alternately crowded his mind; one, that of the woman of his\ndream, entreating him to come back--which his memory clung to as an\noracle; the other, of this woman, cold and lifeless, fathoms deep in the\nsea. He pondered on her chances. She was close to, or on the bridge\nsteps; and boat No. 24, which he was almost sure was being cleared away\nas he looked, would swing close to her as it descended. She could climb\nin and be saved--unless the swimmers from doors and hatches should swamp\nthe boat. And, in his agony of mind, he cursed these swimmers,\npreferring to see her, mentally, the only passenger in the boat, with\nthe watch-on-deck to pull her to safety.\n\nThe potent drug he had taken was still at work, and this, with the\nmusical wash of the sea on the icy beach, and the muffled creaking and\ncrackling beneath and around him--the voice of the iceberg--overcame him\nfinally, and he slept, to waken at daylight with limbs stiffened and\nnumb--almost frozen.\n\nAnd all night, as he slept, a boat with the number twenty-four on her\nbow, pulled by sturdy sailors and steered by brass-buttoned officers,\nwas making for the Southern Lane--the highway of spring traffic. And,\ncrouched in the stern-sheets of this boat was a moaning, praying woman,\nwho cried and screamed at intervals, for husband and baby, and would not\nbe comforted, even when one of the brass-buttoned officers assured her\nthat her child was safe in the care of John Rowland, a brave and trusty\nsailor, who was certainly in the other boat with it. He did not tell\nher, of course, that Rowland had hailed from the berg as she lay\nunconscious, and that if he still had the child, it was with him\nthere--deserted.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nRowland, with some misgivings, drank a small quantity of the liquor, and\nwrapping the still sleeping child in the coat, stepped out on the ice.\nThe fog was gone and a blue, sailless sea stretched out to the horizon.\nBehind him was ice--a mountain of it. He climbed the elevation and\nlooked at another stretch of vacant view from a precipice a hundred\nfeet high. To his left the ice sloped to a steeper beach than the one\nbehind him, and to the right, a pile of hummocks and taller peaks,\ninterspersed with numerous ca\u00c3\u00b1ons and caves, and glistening with\nwaterfalls, shut out the horizon in this direction. Nowhere was there a\nsail or steamer's smoke to cheer him, and he retraced his steps. When\nbut half-way to the wreckage, he saw a moving white object approaching\nfrom the direction of the peaks.\n\nHis eyes were not yet in good condition, and after an uncertain scrutiny\nhe started at a run; for he saw that the mysterious white object was\nnearer the bridge than himself, and rapidly lessening the distance. A\nhundred yards away, his heart bounded and the blood in his veins felt\ncold as the ice under foot, for the white object proved to be a traveler\nfrom the frozen North, lean and famished--a polar bear, who had scented\nfood and was seeking it--coming on at a lumbering run, with great red\njaws half open and yellow fangs exposed. Rowland had no weapon but a\nstrong jackknife, but this he pulled from his pocket and opened as he\nran. Not for an instant did he hesitate at a conflict that promised\nalmost certain death; for the presence of this bear involved the safety\nof a child whose life had become of more importance to him than his own.\nTo his horror, he saw it creep out of the opening in its white covering,\njust as the bear turned the corner of the bridge.\n\n\"Go back, baby, go back,\" he shouted, as he bounded down the slope. The\nbear reached the child first, and with seemingly no effort, dashed it,\nwith a blow of its massive paw, a dozen feet away, where it lay quiet.\nTurning to follow, the brute was met by Rowland.\n\nThe bear rose to his haunches, sank down, and charged; and Rowland felt\nthe bones of his left arm crushing under the bite of the big,\nyellow-fanged jaws. But, falling, he buried the knife-blade in the\nshaggy hide, and the bear, with an angry snarl, spat out the mangled\nmember and dealt him a sweeping blow which sent him farther along the\nice than the child had gone. He arose, with broken ribs, and--scarcely\nfeeling the pain--awaited the second charge. Again was the crushed and\nuseless arm gripped in the yellow vise, and again was he pressed\nbackward; but this time he used the knife with method. The great snout\nwas pressing his breast; the hot, fetid breath was in his nostrils; and\nat his shoulder the hungry eyes were glaring into his own. He struck for\nthe left eye of the brute and struck true. The five-inch blade went in\nto the handle, piercing the brain, and the animal, with a convulsive\nspring which carried him half-way to his feet by the wounded arm, reared\nup, with paws outstretched, to full eight feet of length, then sagged\ndown, and with a few spasmodic kicks, lay still. Rowland had done what\nno Innuit hunter will attempt--he had fought and killed the\nTiger-of-the-North with a knife.\n\nIt had all happened in a minute, but in that minute he was crippled for\nlife; for in the quiet of a hospital, the best of surgical skill could\nhardly avail to reset the fractured particles of bone in the limp arm,\nand bring to place the crushed ribs. And he was adrift on a floating\nisland of ice, with the temperature near the freezing point, and without\neven the rude appliances of the savage.\n\nHe painfully made his way to the little pile of red and white, and\nlifted it with his uninjured arm, though the stooping caused him\nexcruciating torture. The child was bleeding from four deep, cruel\nscratches, extending diagonally from the right shoulder down the back;\nbut he found upon examination that the soft, yielding bones were\nunbroken, and that her unconsciousness came from the rough contact of\nthe little forehead with the ice; for a large lump had raised.\n\nOf pure necessity, his first efforts must be made in his own behalf; so\nwrapping the baby in his coat he placed it in his shelter, and cut and\nmade from the canvas a sling for his dangling arm. Then, with knife,\nfingers, and teeth, he partly skinned the bear--often compelled to pause\nto save himself from fainting with pain--and cut from the warm but not\nvery thick layer of fat a broad slab, which, after bathing the wounds at\na near-by pool, he bound firmly to the little one's back, using the torn\nnight-gown for a bandage.\n\nHe cut the flannel lining from his coat, and from that of the sleeves\nmade nether garments for the little limbs, doubling the surplus length\nover the ankles and tying in place with rope-yarns from a boat-lacing.\nThe body lining he wrapped around her waist, inclosing the arms, and\naround the whole he passed turn upon turn of canvas in strips, marling\nthe mummy-like bundle with yarns, much as a sailor secures chafing-gear\nto the doubled parts of a hawser--a process when complete, that would\nhave aroused the indignation of any mother who saw it. But he was only a\nman, and suffering mental and physical anguish.\n\nBy the time he had finished, the child had recovered consciousness, and\nwas protesting its misery in a feeble, wailing cry. But he dared not\nstop--to become stiffened with cold and pain. There was plenty of fresh\nwater from melting ice, scattered in pools. The bear would furnish food;\nbut they needed fire, to cook this food, keep them warm, and the\ndangerous inflammation from their hurts, and to raise a smoke to be seen\nby passing craft.\n\nHe recklessly drank from the bottle, needing the stimulant, and\nreasoning, perhaps rightly, that no ordinary drug could affect him in\nhis present condition; then he examined the wreckage--most of it good\nkindling wood. Partly above, partly below the pile, was a steel\nlifeboat, decked over air-tight ends, now doubled to more than a right\nangle and resting on its side. With canvas hung over one half, and a\nsmall fire in the other, it promised, by its conducting property, a\nwarmer and better shelter than the bridge. A sailor without matches is\nan anomaly. He whittled shavings, kindled the fire, hung the canvas and\nbrought the child, who begged piteously for a drink of water.\n\nHe found a tin can--possibly left in a leaky boat before its final hoist\nto the davits--and gave her a drink, to which he had added a few drops\nof the whisky. Then he thought of breakfast. Cutting a steak from the\nhindquarters of the bear, he toasted it on the end of a splinter and\nfound it sweet and satisfying; but when he attempted to feed the child,\nhe understood the necessity of freeing its arms--which he did,\nsacrificing his left shirtsleeve to cover them. The change and the food\nstopped its crying for a while, and Rowland lay down with it in the warm\nboat. Before the day had passed the whisky was gone and he was delirious\nwith fever, while the child was but little better.\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nWith lucid intervals, during which he replenished or rebuilt the fire,\ncooked the bear-meat, and fed and dressed the wounds of the child, this\ndelirium lasted three days. His suffering was intense. His arm, the seat\nof throbbing pain, had swollen to twice the natural size, while his\nside prevented him taking a full breath, voluntarily. He had paid no\nattention to his own hurts, and it was either the vigor of a\nconstitution that years of dissipation had not impaired, or some\nanti-febrile property of bear-meat, or the absence of the exciting\nwhisky that won the battle. He rekindled the fire with his last match on\nthe evening of the third day and looked around the darkening horizon,\nsane, but feeble in body and mind.\n\nIf a sail had appeared in the interim, he had not seen it; nor was there\none in sight now. Too weak to climb the slope, he returned to the boat,\nwhere the child, exhausted from fruitless crying, was now sleeping. His\nunskillful and rather heroic manner of wrapping it up to protect it from\ncold had, no doubt, contributed largely to the closing of its wounds by\nforcibly keeping it still, though it must have added to its present\nsufferings. He looked for a moment on the wan, tear-stained little face,\nwith its fringe of tangled curls peeping above the wrappings of canvas,\nand stooping painfully down, kissed it softly; but the kiss awakened it\nand it cried for its mother. He could not soothe it, nor could he try;\nand with a formless, wordless curse against destiny welling up from his\nheart, he left it and sat down on the wreckage at some distance away.\n\n\"We'll very likely get well,\" he mused, gloomily, \"unless I let the fire\ngo out. What then? We can't last longer than the berg, and not much\nlonger than the bear. We must be out of the tracks--we were about nine\nhundred miles out when we struck; and the current sticks to the fog-belt\nhere--about west-sou'west--but that's the surface water. These deep\nfellows have currents of their own. There's no fog; we must be to the\nsouthward of the belt--between the Lanes. They'll run their boats in the\nother Lane after this, I think--the money-grabbing wretches. Curse\nthem--if they've drowned her. Curse them, with their water-tight\ncompartments, and their logging of the lookouts. Twenty-four boats for\nthree thousand people--lashed down with tarred gripe-lashings--thirty\nmen to clear them away, and not an axe on the boat-deck or a\nsheath-knife on a man. Could she have got away? If they got that boat\ndown, they might have taken her in from the steps; and the mate knew I\nhad her child--he would tell her. Her name must be Myra, too; it was her\nvoice I heard in that dream. That was hasheesh. What did they drug me\nfor? But the whisky was all right. It's all done with now, unless I get\nashore--but will I?\"\n\nThe moon rose above the castellated structure to the left, flooding the\nicy beach with ashen-gray light, sparkling in a thousand points from the\ncascades, streams, and rippling pools, throwing into blackest shadow the\ngullies and hollows, and bringing to his mind, in spite of the weird\nbeauty of the scene, a crushing sense of loneliness--of littleness--as\nthough the vast pile of inorganic desolation which held him was of far\ngreater importance than himself, and all the hopes, plans, and fears of\nhis lifetime. The child had cried itself to sleep again, and he paced up\nand down the ice.\n\n\"Up there,\" he said, moodily, looking into the sky, where a few stars\nshone faintly in the flood from the moon; \"Up there--somewhere--they\ndon't know just where--but somewhere up above, is the Christians'\nHeaven. Up there is their good God--who has placed Myra's child\nhere--their good God whom they borrowed from the savage, bloodthirsty\nrace that invented him. And down below us--somewhere again--is their\nhell and their bad god, whom they invented themselves. And they give us\nour choice--Heaven or hell. It is not so--not so. The great mystery is\nnot solved--the human heart is not helped in this way. No good, merciful\nGod created this world or its conditions. Whatever may be the nature of\nthe causes at work beyond our mental vision, one fact is indubitably\nproven--that the qualities of mercy, goodness, justice, play no part in\nthe governing scheme. And yet, they say the core of all religions on\nearth is the belief in this. Is it? Or is it the cowardly, human fear of\nthe unknown--that impels the savage mother to throw her babe to a\ncrocodile--that impels the civilized man to endow churches--that has\nkept in existence from the beginning a class of soothsayers,\nmedicine-men, priests, and clergymen, all living on the hopes and fears\nexcited by themselves?\n\n\"And people pray--millions of them--and claim they are answered. Are\nthey? Was ever supplication sent into that sky by troubled humanity\nanswered, or even heard? Who knows? They pray for rain and sunshine, and\nboth come in time. They pray for health and success and both are but\nnatural in the marching of events. This is not evidence. But they say\nthat they know, by spiritual uplifting, that they are heard, and\ncomforted, and answered at the moment. Is not this a physiological\nexperiment? Would they not feel equally tranquil if they repeated the\nmultiplication table, or boxed the compass?\n\n\"Millions have believed this--that prayers are answered--and these\nmillions have prayed to different gods. Were they all wrong or all\nright? Would a tentative prayer be listened to? Admitting that the\nBibles, and Korans, and Vedas, are misleading and unreliable, may there\nnot be an unseen, unknown Being, who knows my heart--who is watching me\nnow? If so, this Being gave me my reason, which doubts Him, and on Him\nis the responsibility. And would this being, if he exists, overlook a\ndefect for which I am not to blame, and listen to a prayer from me,\nbased on the mere chance that I might be mistaken? Can an unbeliever, in\nthe full strength of his reasoning powers, come to such trouble that he\ncan no longer stand alone, but must cry for help to an imagined power?\nCan such time come to a sane man--to me?\" He looked at the dark line of\nvacant horizon. It was seven miles away; New York was nine hundred; the\nmoon in the east over two hundred thousand, and the stars above, any\nnumber of billions. He was alone, with a sleeping child, a dead bear,\nand the Unknown. He walked softly to the boat and looked at the little\none for a moment; then, raising his head, he whispered: \"For you, Myra.\"\n\nSinking to his knees the atheist lifted his eyes to the heavens, and\nwith his feeble voice and the fervor born of helplessness, prayed to the\nGod that he denied. He begged for the life of the waif in his care--for\nthe safety of the mother, so needful to the little one--and for courage\nand strength to do his part and bring them together. But beyond the\nappeal for help in the service of others, not one word or expressed\nthought of his prayer included himself as a beneficiary. So much for\npride. As he rose to his feet, the flying-jib of a bark appeared around\nthe corner of ice to the right of the beach, and a moment later the\nwhole moon-lit fabric came into view, wafted along by the faint westerly\nair, not half a mile away.\n\nHe sprang to the fire, forgetting his pain, and throwing on wood, made a\nblaze. He hailed, in a frenzy of excitement: \"Bark ahoy! Bark ahoy! Take\nus off,\" and a deep-toned answer came across the water.\n\n\"Wake up, Myra,\" he cried, as he lifted the child; \"wake up. We're going\naway.\"\n\n\"We goin' to mamma?\" she asked, with no symptoms of crying.\n\n\"Yes, we're going to mamma, now--that is,\" he added to himself; \"if that\nclause in the prayer is considered.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later as he watched the approach of a white\nquarter-boat, he muttered: \"That bark was there--half a mile back in\nthis wind--before I thought of praying. Is that prayer answered? Is she\nsafe?\"\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOn the first floor of the London Royal Exchange is a large apartment\nstudded with desks, around and between which surges a hurrying, shouting\ncrowd of brokers, clerks, and messengers. Fringing this apartment are\ndoors and hallways leading to adjacent rooms and offices, and scattered\nthrough it are bulletin-boards, on which are daily written in duplicate\nthe marine casualties of the world. At one end is a raised platform,\nsacred to the presence of an important functionary. In the technical\nlanguage of the \"City,\" the apartment is known as the \"Room,\" and the\nfunctionary, as the \"Caller,\" whose business it is to call out in a\nmighty sing-song voice the names of members wanted at the door, and the\nbare particulars of bulletin news prior to its being chalked out for\nreading.\n\nIt is the headquarters of Lloyds--the immense association of\nunderwriters, brokers, and shipping-men, which, beginning with the\ncustomers at Edward Lloyd's coffee-house in the latter part of the\nseventeenth century, has, retaining his name for a title, developed into\na corporation so well equipped, so splendidly organized and powerful,\nthat kings and ministers of state appeal to it at times for foreign\nnews.\n\nNot a master or mate sails under the English flag but whose record, even\nto forecastle fights, is tabulated at Lloyds for the inspection of\nprospective employers. Not a ship is cast away on any inhabitable coast\nof the world, during underwriters' business hours, but what that mighty\nsing-song cry announces the event at Lloyds within thirty minutes.\n\nOne of the adjoining rooms is known as the Chart-room. Here can be found\nin perfect order and sequence, each on its roller, the newest charts of\nall nations, with a library of nautical literature describing to the\nlast detail the harbors, lights, rocks, shoals, and sailing directions\nof every coast-line shown on the charts; the tracks of latest storms;\nthe changes of ocean currents, and the whereabouts of derelicts and\nicebergs. A member at Lloyds acquires in time a theoretical knowledge of\nthe sea seldom exceeded by the men who navigate it.\n\nAnother apartment--the Captain's room--is given over to joy and\nrefreshment, and still another, the antithesis of the last, is the\nIntelligence office, where anxious ones inquire for and are told the\nlatest news of this or that overdue ship.\n\nOn the day when the assembled throng of underwriters and brokers had\nbeen thrown into an uproarious panic by the Crier's announcement that\nthe great _Titan_ was destroyed, and the papers of Europe and America\nwere issuing extras giving the meager details of the arrival at New York\nof one boat-load of her people, this office had been crowded with\nweeping women and worrying men, who would ask, and remain to ask again,\nfor more news. And when it came--a later cablegram,--giving the story of\nthe wreck and the names of the captain, first officer, boatswain, seven\nsailors, and one lady passenger as those of the saved, a feeble old\ngentleman had raised his voice in a quavering scream, high above the\nsobbing of women, and said:\n\n\"My daughter-in-law is safe; but where is my son,--where is my son, and\nmy grandchild?\" Then he had hurried away, but was back again the next\nday, and the next. And when, on the tenth day of waiting and watching,\nhe learned of another boat-load of sailors and children arrived at\nGibraltar, he shook his head, slowly, muttering: \"George, George,\" and\nleft the room. That night, after telegraphing the consul at Gibraltar of\nhis coming, he crossed the channel.\n\nIn the first tumultuous riot of inquiry, when underwriters had climbed\nover desks and each other to hear again of the wreck of the _Titan_,\none--the noisiest of all, a corpulent, hook-nosed man with flashing\nblack eyes--had broken away from the crowd and made his way to the\nCaptain's room, where, after a draught of brandy, he had seated himself\nheavily, with a groan that came from his soul.\n\n\"Father Abraham,\" he muttered; \"this will ruin me.\"\n\nOthers came in, some to drink, some to condole--all, to talk.\n\n\"Hard hit, Meyer?\" asked one.\n\n\"Ten thousand,\" he answered, gloomily.\n\n\"Serve you right,\" said another, unkindly; \"have more baskets for your\neggs. Knew you'd bring up.\"\n\nThough Mr. Meyer's eyes sparkled at this, he said nothing, but drank\nhimself stupid and was assisted home by one of his clerks. From this on,\nneglecting his business--excepting to occasionally visit the\nbulletins--he spent his time in the Captain's room drinking heavily, and\nbemoaning his luck. On the tenth day he read with watery eyes, posted on\nthe bulletin below the news of the arrival at Gibraltar of the second\nboat-load of people, the following:\n\n    \"Life-buoy of _Royal Age_, London, picked up among wreckage in Lat.\n    45-20, N. Lon. 54-31, W. Ship _Arctic_, Boston, Capt. Brandt.\"\n\n\"Oh, mine good God,\" he howled, as he rushed toward the Captain's room.\n\n\"Poor devil--poor damn fool of an Israelite,\" said one observer to\nanother. \"He covered the whole of the _Royal Age_, and the biggest chunk\nof the _Titan_. It'll take his wife's diamonds to settle.\"\n\nThree weeks later, Mr. Meyer was aroused from a brooding lethargy, by a\ncrowd of shouting underwriters, who rushed into the Captain's room,\nseized him by the shoulders, and hurried him out and up to a bulletin.\n\n\"Read it, Meyer--read it. What d'you think of it?\" With some difficulty\nhe read aloud, while they watched his face:\n\n    \"John Rowland, sailor of the _Titan_, with child passenger, name\n    unknown, on board _Peerless_, Bath, at Christiansand, Norway. Both\n    dangerously ill. Rowland speaks of ship cut in half night before\n    loss of _Titan_.\"\n\n\"What do you make of it, Meyer--_Royal Age_, isn't it?\" asked one.\n\n\"Yes,\" vociferated another, \"I've figured back. Only ship not reported\nlately. Overdue two months. Was spoken same day fifty miles east of that\niceberg.\"\n\n\"Sure thing,\" said others. \"Nothing said about it in the captain's\nstatement--looks queer.\"\n\n\"Vell, vwhat of it,\" said Mr. Meyer, painfully and stupidly: \"dere is a\ncollision clause in der _Titan's_ policy; I merely bay the money to der\nsteamship company instead of to der _Royal Age_ beeple.\"\n\n\"But why did the captain conceal it?\" they shouted at him. \"What's his\nobject--assured against collision suits?\"\n\n\"Der looks of it, berhaps--looks pad.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Meyer, what's the matter with you? Which one of the lost\ntribes did you spring from--you're like none of your race--drinking\nyourself stupid like a good Christian. I've got a thousand on the\n_Titan_, and if I'm to pay it I want to know why. You've got the\nheaviest risk and the brain to fight for it--you've got to do it. Go\nhome, straighten up, and attend to this. We'll watch Rowland till you\ntake hold. We're all caught.\"\n\nThey put him into a cab, took him to a Turkish bath, and then home.\n\nThe next morning he was at his desk, clear-eyed and clear-headed, and\nfor a few weeks was a busy, scheming man of business.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nOn a certain morning, about two months after the announcement of the\nloss of the _Titan_, Mr. Meyer sat at his desk in the Rooms, busily\nwriting, when the old gentleman who had bewailed the death of his son in\nthe Intelligence office tottered in and took a chair beside him.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Selfridge,\" he said, scarcely looking up; \"I suppose\nyou have come to see der insurance paid over. Der sixty days are up.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Mr. Meyer,\" said the old gentleman, wearily; \"of course, as\nmerely a stockholder, I can take no active part; but I am a member here,\nand naturally a little anxious. All I had in the world--even to my son\nand grandchild--was in the _Titan_.\"\n\n\"It is very sad, Mr. Selfridge; you have my deepest sympathy. I pelieve\nyou are der largest holder of _Titan_ stock--about one hundred thousand,\nis it not?\"\n\n\"About that.\"\n\n\"I am der heaviest insurer; so Mr. Selfridge, this battle will be\nlargely petween you and myself.\"\n\n\"Battle--is there to be any difficulty?\" asked Mr. Selfridge, anxiously.\n\n\"Berhaps--I do not know. Der underwriters and outside companies have\nblaced matters in my hands and will not bay until I take der initiative.\nWe must hear from one John Rowland, who, with a little child, was\nrescued from der berg and taken to Christiansand. He has been too sick\nto leave der ship which found him and is coming up der Thames in her\nthis morning. I have a carriage at der dock and expect him at my office\npy noon. Dere is where we will dransact this little pizness--not here.\"\n\n\"A child--saved,\" queried the old gentleman; \"dear me, it may be little\nMyra. She was not at Gibraltar with the others. I would not care--I\nwould not care much about the money, if she was safe. But my son--my\nonly son--is gone; and, Mr. Meyer, I am a ruined man if this insurance\nis not paid.\"\n\n\"And I am a ruined man if it is,\" said Mr. Meyer, rising. \"Will you come\naround to der office, Mr. Selfridge? I expect der attorney and Captain\nBryce are dere now.\" Mr. Selfridge arose and accompanied him to the\nstreet.\n\nA rather meagerly-furnished private office in Threadneedle Street,\npartitioned off from a larger one bearing Mr. Meyer's name in the\nwindow, received the two men, one of whom, in the interests of good\nbusiness, was soon to be impoverished. They had not waited a minute\nbefore Captain Bryce and Mr. Austen were announced and ushered in.\nSleek, well-fed, and gentlemanly in manner, perfect types of the\nBritish naval officer, they bowed politely to Mr. Selfridge when Mr.\nMeyer introduced them as the captain and first officer of the _Titan_,\nand seated themselves. A few moments later brought a shrewd-looking\nperson whom Mr. Meyer addressed as the attorney for the steamship\ncompany, but did not introduce; for such are the amenities of the\nEnglish system of caste.\n\n\"Now then, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Meyer, \"I pelieve we can broceed to\npizness up to a certain point--berhaps further. Mr. Thompson, you have\nthe affidavit of Captain Bryce?\"\n\n\"I have,\" said the attorney, producing a document which Mr. Meyer\nglanced at and handed back.\n\n\"And in this statement, captain,\" he said, \"you have sworn that der\nvoyage was uneventful up to der moment of der wreck--that is,\" he added,\nwith an oily smile, as he noticed the paling of the captain's\nface--\"that nothing occurred to make der _Titan_ less seaworthy or\nmanageable?\"\n\n\"That is what I swore to,\" said the captain, with a little sigh.\n\n\"You are part owner, are you not, Captain Bryce?\"\n\n\"I own five shares of the company's stock.\"\n\n\"I have examined der charter and der company lists,\" said Mr. Meyer;\n\"each boat of der company is, so far as assessments and dividends are\nconcerned, a separate company. I find you are listed as owning two\nsixty-seconds of der _Titan_ stock. This makes you, under der law, part\nowner of der _Titan_, and responsible as such.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, sir, by that word responsible?\" said Captain Bryce,\nquickly.\n\nFor answer, Mr. Meyer elevated his black eyebrows, assumed an attitude\nof listening, looked at his watch and went to the door, which, as he\nopened, admitted the sound of carriage wheels.\n\n\"In here,\" he called to his clerks, then faced the captain.\n\n\"What do I mean, Captain Bryce?\" he thundered. \"I mean that you have\nconcealed in your sworn statement all reference to der fact that you\ncollided with and sunk the ship _Royal Age_ on der night before the\nwreck of your own ship.\"\n\n\"Who says so--how do you know it?\" blustered the captain. \"You have only\nthat bulletin statement of the man Rowland--an irresponsible drunkard.\"\n\n\"The man was lifted aboard drunk at New York,\" broke in the first\nofficer, \"and remained in a condition of delirium tremens up to the\nshipwreck. We did not meet the _Royal Age_ and are in no way responsible\nfor her loss.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" added Captain Bryce, \"and a man in that condition is liable to\nsee anything. We listened to his ravings on the night of the wreck. He\nwas on lookout--on the bridge. Mr. Austen, the boats'n, and myself were\nclose to him.\"\n\nBefore Mr. Meyer's oily smile had indicated to the flustered captain\nthat he had said too much, the door opened and admitted Rowland, pale,\nand weak, with empty left sleeve, leaning on the arm of a bronze-bearded\nand manly-looking giant who carried little Myra on the other shoulder,\nand who said, in the breezy tone of the quarter-deck:\n\n\"Well, I've brought him, half dead; but why couldn't you give me time to\ndock my ship? A mate can't do everything.\"\n\n\"And this is Captain Barry, of der _Peerless_,\" said Mr. Meyer, taking\nhis hand. \"It is all right, my friend; you will not lose. And this is\nMr. Rowland--and this is der little child. Sit down, my friend. I\ncongratulate you on your escape.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Rowland, weakly, as he seated himself; \"they cut my\narm off at Christiansand, and I still live. That is my escape.\"\n\nCaptain Bryce and Mr. Austen, pale and motionless, stared hard at this\nman, in whose emaciated face, refined by suffering to the almost\nspiritual softness of age, they hardly recognized the features of the\ntroublesome sailor of the _Titan_. His clothing, though clean, was\nragged and patched.\n\nMr. Selfridge had arisen and was also staring, not at Rowland, but at\nthe child, who, seated in the lap of the big Captain Barry, was looking\naround with wondering eyes. Her costume was unique. A dress of\nbagging-stuff, put together--as were her canvas shoes and hat--with\nsail-twine in sail-makers' stitches, three to the inch, covered skirts\nand underclothing made from old flannel shirts. It represented many an\nhour's work of the watch-below, lovingly bestowed by the crew of the\n_Peerless_; for the crippled Rowland could not sew. Mr. Selfridge\napproached, scanned the pretty features closely, and asked:\n\n\"What is her name?\"\n\n\"Her first name is Myra,\" answered Rowland. \"She remembers that; but I\nhave not learned her last name, though I knew her mother years\nago--before her marriage.\"\n\n\"Myra, Myra,\" repeated the old gentleman; \"do you know me? Don't you\nknow me?\" He trembled visibly as he stooped and kissed her. The little\nforehead puckered and wrinkled as the child struggled with memory; then\nit cleared and the whole face sweetened to a smile.\n\n\"Gwampa,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, God, I thank thee,\" murmured Mr. Selfridge, taking her in his arms.\n\"I have lost my son, but I have found his child--my granddaughter.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" asked Rowland, eagerly; \"you--this child's grandfather?\nYour son is lost, you say? Was he on board the _Titan_? And the\nmother--was she saved, or is she, too--\" he stopped unable to continue.\n\n\"The mother is safe--in New York; but the father, my son, has not yet\nbeen heard from,\" said the old man, mournfully.\n\nRowland's head sank and he hid his face for a moment in his arm, on the\ntable at which he sat. It had been a face as old, and worn, and weary as\nthat of the white-haired man confronting him. On it, when it\nraised--flushed, bright-eyed and smiling--was the glory of youth.\n\n\"I trust, sir,\" he said, \"that you will telegraph her. I am penniless at\npresent, and, besides, do not know her name.\"\n\n\"Selfridge--which, of course, is my own name. Mrs. Colonel, or Mrs.\nGeorge Selfridge. Our New York address is well known. But I shall cable\nher at once; and, believe me, sir, although I can understand that our\ndebt to you cannot be named in terms of money, you need not be penniless\nlong. You are evidently a capable man, and I have wealth and influence.\"\n\nRowland merely bowed, slightly, but Mr. Meyer muttered to himself:\n\"Vealth and influence. Berhaps not. Now, gentlemen,\" he added, in a\nlouder tone, \"to pizness. Mr. Rowland, will you tell us about der\nrunning down of der _Royal Age_?\"\n\n\"Was it the _Royal Age_?\" asked Rowland. \"I sailed in her one voyage.\nYes, certainly.\"\n\nMr. Selfridge, more interested in Myra than in the coming account,\ncarried her over to a chair in the corner and sat down, where he fondled\nand talked to her after the manner of grandfathers the world over, and\nRowland, first looking steadily into the faces of the two men he had\ncome to expose, and whose presence he had thus far ignored, told, while\nthey held their teeth tight together and often buried their finger-nails\nin their palms, the terrible story of the cutting in half of the ship on\nthe first night out from New York, finishing with the attempted bribery\nand his refusal.\n\n\"Vell, gentlemen, vwhat do you think of that?\" asked Mr. Meyer, looking\naround.\n\n\"A lie, from beginning to end,\" stormed Captain Bryce.\n\nRowland rose to his feet, but was pressed back by the big man who had\naccompanied him--who then faced Captain Bryce and said, quietly:\n\n\"I saw a polar bear that this man killed in open fight. I saw his arm\nafterward, and while nursing him away from death I heard no whines or\ncomplaints. He can fight his own battles when well, and when sick I'll\ndo it for him. If you insult him again in my presence I'll knock your\nteeth down your throat.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThere was a moment's silence while the two captains eyed one another,\nbroken by the attorney, who said:\n\n\"Whether this story is true or false, it certainly has no bearing on the\nvalidity of the policy. If this happened, it was after the policy\nattached and before the wreck of the _Titan_.\"\n\n\"But der concealment--der concealment,\" shouted Mr. Meyer, excitedly.\n\n\"Has no bearing, either. If he concealed anything it was done after the\nwreck, and after your liability was confirmed. It was not even barratry.\nYou must pay this insurance.\"\n\n\"I will not bay it. I will not. I will fight you in der courts.\" Mr.\nMeyer stamped up and down the floor in his excitement, then stopped with\na triumphant smile, and shook his finger into the face of the attorney.\n\n\"And even if der concealment will not vitiate der policy, der fact that\nhe had a drunken man on lookout when der _Titan_ struck der iceberg will\nbe enough. Go ahead and sue. I will not pay. He was part owner.\"\n\n\"You have no witnesses to that admission,\" said the attorney. Mr. Meyer\nlooked around the group and the smile left his face.\n\n\"Captain Bryce was mistaken,\" said Mr. Austen. \"This man was drunk at\nNew York, like others of the crew. But he was sober and competent when\non lookout. I discussed theories of navigation with him during his trick\non the bridge that night and he spoke intelligently.\"\n\n\"But you yourself said, not ten minutes ago, that this man was in a\nstate of delirium tremens up to der collision,\" said Mr. Meyer.\n\n\"What I said and what I will admit under oath are two different things,\"\nsaid the officer, desperately. \"I may have said anything under the\nexcitement of the moment--when we were accused of such an infamous\ncrime. I say now, that John Rowland, whatever may have been his\ncondition on the preceding night, was a sober and competent lookout at\nthe time of the wreck of the _Titan_.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Rowland, dryly, to the first officer; then, looking\ninto the appealing face of Mr. Meyer, he said:\n\n\"I do not think it will be necessary to brand me before the world as an\ninebriate in order to punish the company and these men. Barratry, as I\nunderstand it, is the unlawful act of a captain or crew at sea, causing\ndamage or loss; and it only applies when the parties are purely\nemployees. Did I understand rightly--that Captain Bryce was part owner\nof the _Titan_?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Meyer, \"he owns stock; and we insure against barratry;\nbut this man, as part owner, could not fall back on it.\"\n\n\"And an unlawful act,\" went on Rowland, \"perpetrated by a captain who is\npart owner, which might cause shipwreck, and, during the perpetration of\nwhich shipwreck really occurs, will be sufficient to void the policy.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Mr. Meyer, eagerly. \"You were drunk on der\nlookout--you were raving drunk, as he said himself. You will swear to\nthis, will you not, my friend? It is bad faith with der underwriters. It\nannuls der insurance. You admit this, Mr. Thompson, do you not?\"\n\n\"That is law,\" said the attorney, coldly.\n\n\"Was Mr. Austen a part owner, also?\" asked Rowland, ignoring Mr. Meyer's\nview of the case.\n\n\"One share, is it not, Mr. Austen?\" asked Mr. Meyer, while he rubbed his\nhands and smiled. Mr. Austen made no sign of denial and Rowland\ncontinued:\n\n\"Then, for drugging a sailor into a stupor, and having him on lookout\nout of his turn while in that condition, and at the moment when the\n_Titan_ struck the iceberg, Captain Bryce and Mr. Austen have, as part\nowners, committed an act which nullifies the insurance on that ship.\"\n\n\"You infernal, lying scoundrel!\" roared Captain Bryce. He strode toward\nRowland with threatening face. Half-way, he was stopped by the impact of\na huge brown fist which sent him reeling and staggering across the room\ntoward Mr. Selfridge and the child, over whom he floundered to the\nfloor--a disheveled heap,--while the big Captain Barry examined\nteeth-marks on his knuckles, and every one else sprang to their feet.\n\n\"I told you to look out,\" said Captain Barry. \"Treat my friend\nrespectfully.\" He glared steadily at the first officer, as though\ninviting him to duplicate the offense; but that gentleman backed away\nfrom him and assisted the dazed Captain Bryce to a chair, where he felt\nof his loosened teeth, spat blood upon Mr. Meyer's floor, and gradually\nawakened to a realization of the fact that he had been knocked down--and\nby an American.\n\nLittle Myra, unhurt but badly frightened, began to cry and call for\nRowland in her own way, to the wonder, and somewhat to the scandal of\nthe gentle old man who was endeavoring to soothe her.\n\n\"Dammy,\" she cried, as she struggled to go to him; \"I want\nDammy--Dammy--Da-a-may.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a pad little girl,\" said the jocular Mr. Meyer, looking down\non her. \"Where did you learn such language?\"\n\n\"It is my nickname,\" said Rowland, smiling in spite of himself. \"She has\ncoined the word,\" he explained to the agitated Mr. Selfridge, who had\nnot yet comprehended what had happened; \"and I have not yet been able to\npersuade her to drop it--and I could not be harsh with her. Let me take\nher, sir.\" He seated himself, with the child, who nestled up to him\ncontentedly and soon was tranquil.\n\n\"Now, my friend,\" said Mr. Meyer, \"you must tell us about this\ndrugging.\" Then while Captain Bryce, under the memory of the blow he had\nreceived, nursed himself into an insane fury; and Mr. Austen, with his\nhand resting lightly on the captain's shoulder ready to restrain him,\nlistened to the story; and the attorney drew up a chair and took notes\nof the story; and Mr. Selfridge drew his chair close to Myra and paid no\nattention to the story at all, Rowland recited the events prior to and\nsucceeding the shipwreck. Beginning with the finding of the whisky in\nhis pocket, he told of his being called to the starboard bridge lookout\nin place of the rightful incumbent; of the sudden and strange interest\nMr. Austen displayed as to his knowledge of navigation; of the pain in\nhis stomach, the frightful shapes he had seen on the deck beneath and\nthe sensations of his dream--leaving out only the part which bore on the\nwoman he loved; he told of the sleep-walking child which awakened him,\nof the crash of ice and instant wreck, and the fixed condition of his\neyes which prevented their focusing only at a certain distance,\nfinishing his story--to explain his empty sleeve--with a graphic account\nof the fight with the bear.\n\n\"And I have studied it all out,\" he said, in conclusion. \"I was\ndrugged--I believe, with hasheesh, which makes a man see strange\nthings--and brought up on the bridge lookout where I could be watched\nand my ravings listened to and recorded, for the sole purpose of\ndiscrediting my threatened testimony in regard to the collision of the\nnight before. But I was only half-drugged, as I spilled part of my tea\nat supper. In that tea, I am positive, was the hasheesh.\"\n\n\"You know all about it, don't you,\" snarled Captain Bryce, from his\nchair, \"'twas not hasheesh; 'twas an infusion of Indian hemp; you don't\nknow--\" Mr. Austen's hand closed over his mouth and he subsided.\n\n\"Self-convicted,\" said Rowland, with a quiet laugh. \"Hasheesh is made\nfrom Indian hemp.\"\n\n\"You hear this, gentlemen,\" exclaimed Mr. Meyer, springing to his feet\nand facing everybody in turn. He pounced on Captain Barry. \"You hear\nthis confession, captain; you hear him say Indian hemp? I have a\nwitness now, Mr. Thompson. Go right on with your suit. You hear him,\nCaptain Barry. You are disinterested. You are a witness. You hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard it--the murdering scoundrel,\" said the captain.\n\nMr. Meyer danced up and down in his joy, while the attorney, pocketing\nhis notes, remarked to the discomfited Captain Bryce: \"You are the\npoorest fool I know,\" and left the office.\n\nThen Mr. Meyer calmed himself, and facing the two steamship officers,\nsaid, slowly and impressively, while he poked his forefinger almost into\ntheir faces:\n\n\"England is a fine country, my friends--a fine country to leave pehind\nsometimes. Dere is Canada, and der United States, and Australia, and\nSouth Africa--all fine countries, too--fine countries to go to with new\nnames. My friends, you will be bulletined and listed at Lloyds in less\nthan half an hour, and you will never again sail under der English flag\nas officers. And, my friends, let me say, that in half an hour after you\nare bulletined, all Scotland Yard will be looking for you. But my door\nis not locked.\"\n\nSilently they arose, pale, shamefaced, and crushed, and went out the\ndoor, through the outer office, and into the street.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nMr. Selfridge had begun to take an interest in the proceedings. As the\ntwo men passed out he arose and asked:\n\n\"Have you reached a settlement, Mr. Meyer? Will the insurance be paid?\"\n\n\"No,\" roared the underwriter, in the ear of the puzzled old gentleman;\nwhile he slapped him vigorously on the back; \"it will not be paid. You\nor I must have been ruined, Mr. Selfridge, and it has settled on you. I\ndo not pay der _Titan's_ insurance--nor will der other insurers. On der\ncontrary, as der collision clause in der policy is void with der rest,\nyour company must reimburse me for der insurance which I must pay to der\n_Royal Age_ owners--that is, unless our good friend here, Mr. Rowland,\nwho was on der lookout at der time, will swear that her lights were\nout.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Rowland. \"Her lights were burning--look to the old\ngentleman,\" he exclaimed. \"Look out for him. Catch him!\"\n\nMr. Selfridge was stumbling toward a chair. He grasped it, loosened his\nhold, and before anyone could reach him, fell to the floor, where he\nlay, with ashen lips and rolling eyes, gasping convulsively.\n\n\"Heart failure,\" said Rowland, as he knelt by his side. \"Send for a\ndoctor.\"\n\n\"Send for a doctor,\" repeated Mr. Meyer through the door to his clerks;\n\"and send for a carriage, quick. I don't want him to die in der office.\"\n\nCaptain Barry lifted the helpless figure to a couch, and they watched,\nwhile the convulsions grew easier, the breath shorter, and the lips from\nashen gray to blue. Before a doctor or carriage had come, he had passed\naway.\n\n\"Sudden emotion of some kind,\" said the doctor when he did arrive.\n\"Violent emotion, too. Hear bad news?\"\n\n\"Bad and good,\" answered the underwriter. \"Good, in learning that this\ndear little girl was his granddaughter--bad, in learning that he was a\nruined man. He was der heaviest stockholder in der _Titan_. One hundred\nthousand pounds, he owned, of der stock, all of which this poor, dear\nlittle child will not get.\" Mr. Meyer looked sorrowful, as he patted\nMyra on the head.\n\nCaptain Barry beckoned to Rowland, who, slightly flushed, was standing\nby the still figure on the couch and watching the face of Mr. Meyer, on\nwhich annoyance, jubilation, and simulated shock could be seen in turn.\n\n\"Wait,\" he said, as he turned to watch the doctor leave the room. \"Is\nthis so, Mr. Meyer,\" he added to the underwriter, \"that Mr. Selfridge\nowned _Titan_ stock, and would have been ruined, had he lived, by the\nloss of the insurance money?\"\n\n\"Yes, he would have been a poor man. He had invested his last\nfarthing--one hundred thousand pounds. And if he had left any more it\nwould be assessed to make good his share of what der company must bay\nfor der _Royal Age_, which I also insured.\"\n\n\"Was there a collision clause in the _Titan's_ policy?\"\n\n\"Dere was.\"\n\n\"And you took the risk, knowing that she was to run the Northern Lane at\nfull speed through fog and snow?\"\n\n\"I did--so did others.\"\n\n\"Then, Mr. Meyer, it remains for me to tell you that the insurance on\nthe _Titan_ will be paid, as well as any liabilities included in and\nspecified by the collision clause in the policy. In short, I, the one\nman who can prevent it, refuse to testify.\"\n\n\"Vwhat-a-t?\"\n\nMr. Meyer grasped the back of a chair and, leaning over it, stared at\nRowland.\n\n\"You will not testify? Vwhat you mean?\"\n\n\"What I said; and I do not feel called upon to give you my reasons, Mr.\nMeyer.\"\n\n\"My good friend,\" said the underwriter, advancing with outstretched\nhands to Rowland, who backed away, and taking Myra by the hand, moved\ntoward the door. Mr. Meyer sprang ahead, locked it and removed the key,\nand faced them.\n\n\"Oh, mine goot Gott,\" he shouted, relapsing in his excitement into the\nmore pronounced dialect of his race; \"vwhat I do to you, hey? Vwhy you\ngo pack on me, hey? Haf I not bay der doctor's bill? Haf I not bay for\nder carriage? Haf I not treat you like one shentleman? Haf I not, hey? I\nsit you down in mine office and call you Mr. Rowland. Haf I not been one\nshentleman?\"\n\n\"Open that door,\" said Rowland, quietly.\n\n\"Yes, open it,\" repeated Captain Barry, his puzzled face clearing at the\nprospect of action on his part. \"Open it or I'll kick it down.\"\n\n\"But you, mine friend--heard der admission of der captain--of der\ndrugging. One goot witness will do: two is petter. But you will swear,\nmine friend, you will not ruin me.\"\n\n\"I stand by Rowland,\" said the captain, grimly. \"I don't remember what\nwas said, anyhow; got a blamed bad memory. Get away from that door.\"\n\nGrievous lamentation--weepings and wailings, and the most genuine\ngnashing of teeth--interspersed with the feebler cries of the frightened\nMyra and punctuated by terse commands in regard to the door, filled that\nprivate office, to the wonder of the clerks without, and ended, at last,\nwith the crashing of the door from its hinges.\n\nCaptain Barry, Rowland, and Myra, followed by a parting, heart-borne\nmalediction from the agitated underwriter, left the office and reached\nthe street. The carriage that had brought them was still waiting.\n\n\"Settle inside,\" called the captain to the driver. \"We'll take another,\nRowland.\"\n\nAround the first corner they found a cab, which they entered, Captain\nBarry giving the driver the direction--\"Bark _Peerless_, East India\nDock.\"\n\n\"I think I understand the game, Rowland,\" he said, as they started; \"you\ndon't want to break this child.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" answered Rowland, weakly, as he leaned back on the cushion,\nfaint from the excitement of the last few moments. \"And as for the right\nor wrong of the position I am in--why, we must go farther back for it\nthan the question of lookouts. The cause of the wreck was full speed in\na fog. All hands on lookout could not have seen that berg. The\nunderwriters knew the speed and took the risk. Let them pay.\"\n\n\"Right--and I'm with you on it. But you must get out of the country. I\ndon't know the law on the matter, but they may compel you to testify.\nYou can't ship 'fore the mast again--that's settled. But you can have a\nberth mate with me as long as I sail a ship--if you'll take it; and\nyou're to make my cabin your home as long as you like; remember that.\nStill, I know you want to get across with the kid, and if you stay\naround until I sail it may be months before you get to New York, with\nthe chance of losing her by getting foul of English law. But just leave\nit to me. There are powerful interests at stake in regard to this\nmatter.\"\n\nWhat Captain Barry had in mind, Rowland was too weak to inquire. On\ntheir arrival at the bark he was assisted by his friend to a couch in\nthe cabin, where he spent the rest of the day, unable to leave it.\nMeanwhile, Captain Barry had gone ashore again.\n\nReturning toward evening, he said to the man on the couch: \"I've got\nyour pay, Rowland, and signed a receipt for it to that attorney. He paid\nit out of his own pocket. You could have worked that company for fifty\nthousand, or more; but I knew you wouldn't touch their money, and so,\nonly struck him for your wages. You're entitled to a month's pay. Here\nit is--American money--about seventeen.\" He gave Rowland a roll of\nbills.\n\n\"Now here's something else, Rowland,\" he continued, producing an\nenvelope. \"In consideration of the fact that you lost all your clothes\nand later, your arm, through the carelessness of the company's officers,\nMr. Thompson offers you this.\" Rowland opened the envelope. In it were\ntwo first cabin tickets from Liverpool to New York. Flushing hotly, he\nsaid, bitterly:\n\n\"It seems that I'm not to escape it, after all.\"\n\n\"Take 'em, old man, take 'em; in fact, I took 'em for you, and you and\nthe kid are booked. And I made Thompson agree to settle your doctor's\nbill and expenses with that Sheeny. 'Tisn't bribery. I'd heel you myself\nfor the run over, but, hang it, you'll take nothing from me. You've got\nto get the young un over. You're the only one to do it. The old\ngentleman was an American, alone here--hadn't even a lawyer, that I\ncould find. The boat sails in the morning and the night train leaves in\ntwo hours. Think of that mother, Rowland. Why, man, I'd travel round the\nworld to stand in your shoes when you hand Myra over. I've got a child\nof my own.\" The captain's eyes were winking hard and fast, and Rowland's\nwere shining.\n\n\"Yes, I'll take the passage,\" he said, with a smile. \"I accept the\nbribe.\"\n\n\"That's right. You'll be strong and healthy when you land, and when that\nmother's through thanking you, and you have to think of yourself,\nremember--I want a mate and will be here a month before sailing. Write\nto me, care o' Lloyds, if you want the berth, and I'll send you advance\nmoney to get back with.\"\n\n\"Thank you, captain,\" said Rowland, as he took the other's hand and then\nglanced at his empty sleeve; \"but my going to sea is ended. Even a mate\nneeds two hands.\"\n\n\"Well, suit yourself, Rowland; I'll take you mate without any hands at\nall while you had your brains. It's done me good to meet a man like you;\nand--say, old man, you won't take it wrong from me, will you? It's none\no' my business, but you're too all-fired good a man to drink. You\nhaven't had a nip for two months. Are you going to begin?\"\n\n\"Never again,\" said Rowland, rising. \"I've a future now, as well as a\npast.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nIt was near noon of the next day that Rowland, seated in a steamer-chair\nwith Myra and looking out on a sail-spangled stretch of blue from the\nsaloon-deck of a west-bound liner, remembered that he had made no\nprovisions to have Mrs. Selfridge notified by cable of the safety of her\nchild; and unless Mr. Meyer or his associates gave the story to the\npress it would not be known.\n\n\"Well,\" he mused, \"joy will not kill, and I shall witness it in its\nfullness if I take her by surprise. But the chances are that it will get\ninto the papers before I reach her. It is too good for Mr. Meyer to\nkeep.\"\n\nBut the story was not given out immediately. Mr. Meyer called a\nconference of the underwriters concerned with him in the insurance of\nthe _Titan_ at which it was decided to remain silent concerning the card\nthey hoped to play, and to spend a little time and money in hunting for\nother witnesses among the _Titan's_ crew, and in interviewing Captain\nBarry, to the end of improving his memory. A few stormy meetings with\nthis huge obstructionist convinced them of the futility of further\neffort in his direction, and, after finding at the end of a week that\nevery surviving member of the _Titan's_ port watch, as well as a few of\nthe other, had been induced to sign for Cape voyages, or had otherwise\ndisappeared, they decided to give the story told by Rowland to the press\nin the hope that publicity would avail to bring to light corroboratory\nevidence.\n\nAnd this story, improved upon in the repeating by Mr. Meyer to\nreporters, and embellished still further by the reporters as they wrote\nit up, particularly in the part pertaining to the polar bear,--blazoned\nout in the great dailies of England and the Continent, and was cabled to\nNew York, with the name of the steamer in which John Rowland had sailed\n(for his movements had been traced in the search for evidence), where it\narrived, too late for publication, the morning of the day on which, with\nMyra on his shoulder, he stepped down the gang-plank at a North River\ndock. As a consequence, he was surrounded on the dock by enthusiastic\nreporters, who spoke of the story and asked for details. He refused to\ntalk, escaped them, and gaining the side streets, soon found himself in\ncrowded Broadway, where he entered the office of the steamship company\nin whose employ he had been wrecked, and secured from the _Titan's_\npassenger-list the address of Mrs. Selfridge--the only woman saved. Then\nhe took a car up Broadway and alighted abreast of a large department\nstore.\n\n\"We're going to see mamma, soon, Myra,\" he whispered in the pink ear;\n\"and you must go dressed up. It don't matter about me; but you're a\nFifth Avenue baby--a little aristocrat. These old clothes won't do,\nnow.\" But she had forgotten the word \"mamma,\" and was more interested\nin the exciting noise and life of the street than in the clothing she\nwore. In the store, Rowland asked for, and was directed to the\nchildren's department, where a young woman waited on him.\n\n\"This child has been shipwrecked,\" he said. \"I have sixteen dollars and\na half to spend on it. Give it a bath, dress its hair, and use up the\nmoney on a dress, shoes, and stockings, underclothing, and a hat.\" The\nyoung woman stooped and kissed the little girl from sheer sympathy, but\nprotested that not much could be done.\n\n\"Do your best,\" said Rowland; \"it is all I have. I will wait here.\"\n\nAn hour later, penniless again, he emerged from the store with Myra,\nbravely dressed in her new finery, and was stopped at the corner by a\npoliceman who had seen him come out, and who marveled, doubtless, at\nsuch juxtaposition of rags and ribbons.\n\n\"Whose kid ye got?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I believe it is the daughter of Mrs. Colonel Selfridge,\" answered\nRowland, haughtily--too haughtily, by far.\n\n\"Ye believe--but ye don't know. Come back into the shtore, me tourist,\nand we'll see who ye shtole it from.\"\n\n\"Very well, officer; I can prove possession.\" They started back, the\nofficer with his hand on Rowland's collar, and were met at the door by a\nparty of three or four people coming out. One of this party, a young\nwoman in black, uttered a piercing shriek and sprang toward them.\n\n\"Myra!\" she screamed. \"Give me my baby--give her to me.\"\n\nShe snatched the child from Rowland's shoulder, hugged it, kissed it,\ncried, and screamed over it; then, oblivious to the crowd that\ncollected, incontinently fainted in the arms of an indignant old\ngentleman.\n\n\"You scoundrel!\" he exclaimed, as he flourished his cane over Rowland's\nhead with his free arm. \"We've caught you. Officer, take that man to the\nstation-house. I will follow and make a charge in the name of my\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"Then he shtole the kid, did he?\" asked the policeman.\n\n\"Most certainly,\" answered the old gentleman, as, with the assistance of\nthe others, he supported the unconscious young mother to a carriage.\nThey all entered, little Myra screaming for Rowland from the arms of a\nfemale member of the party, and were driven off.\n\n\"C'm an wi' me,\" uttered the officer, rapping his prisoner on the head\nwith his club and jerking him off his feet.\n\nThen, while an approving crowd applauded, the man who had fought and\nconquered a hungry polar bear was dragged through the streets like a\nsick animal by a New York policeman. For such is the stultifying effect\nof a civilized environment.\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nIn New York City there are homes permeated by a moral atmosphere so\npure, so elevated, so sensitive to the vibrations of human woe and\nmisdoing, that their occupants are removed completely from all\nconsideration of any but the spiritual welfare of poor humanity. In\nthese homes the news-gathering, sensation-mongering daily paper does not\nenter.\n\nIn the same city are dignified magistrates--members of clubs and\nsocieties--who spend late hours, and often fail to arise in the morning\nin time to read the papers before the opening of court.\n\nAlso in New York are city editors, bilious of stomach, testy of speech,\nand inconsiderate of reporters' feelings and professional pride. Such\neditors, when a reporter has failed, through no fault of his own, in\nsuccessfully interviewing a celebrity, will sometimes send him\nnews-gathering in the police courts, where printable news is scarce.\n\nOn the morning following the arrest of John Rowland, three reporters,\nsent by three such editors, attended a hall of justice presided over by\none of the late-rising magistrates mentioned above. In the anteroom of\nthis court, ragged, disfigured by his clubbing, and disheveled by his\nnight in a cell, stood Rowland, with other unfortunates more or less\nguilty of offense against society. When his name was called, he was\nhustled through a door, along a line of policemen--each of whom added to\nhis own usefulness by giving him a shove--and into the dock, where the\nstern-faced and tired-looking magistrate glared at him. Seated in a\ncorner of the court-room were the old gentleman of the day before, the\nyoung mother with little Myra in her lap, and a number of other\nladies--all excited in demeanor; and all but the young mother directing\nvenomous glances at Rowland. Mrs. Selfridge, pale and hollow-eyed, but\nhappy-faced, withal, allowed no wandering glance to rest on him.\n\nThe officer who had arrested Rowland was sworn, and testified that he\nhad stopped the prisoner on Broadway while making off with the child,\nwhose rich clothing had attracted his attention. Disdainful sniffs were\nheard in the corner with muttered remarks: \"Rich indeed--the idea--the\nflimsiest prints.\" Mr. Gaunt, the prosecuting witness, was called to\ntestify.\n\n\"This man, your Honor,\" he began, excitedly, \"was once a gentleman and a\nfrequent guest at my house. He asked for the hand of my daughter, and as\nhis request was not granted, threatened revenge. Yes, sir. And out on\nthe broad Atlantic, where he had followed my daughter in the guise of a\nsailor, he attempted to murder that child--my grandchild; but was\ndiscovered--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" interrupted the magistrate. \"Confine your testimony to the\npresent offense.\"\n\n\"Yes, your Honor. Failing in this, he stole, or enticed the little one\nfrom its bed, and in less than five minutes the ship was wrecked, and he\nmust have escaped with the child in--\"\n\n\"Were you a witness of this?\"\n\n\"I was not there, your Honor; but we have it on the word of the first\nofficer, a gentleman--\"\n\n\"Step down, sir. That will do. Officer, was this offense committed in\nNew York?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Honor; I caught him meself.\"\n\n\"Who did he steal the child from?\"\n\n\"That leddy over yonder.\"\n\n\"Madam, will you take the stand?\"\n\nWith her child in her arms, Mrs. Selfridge was sworn and in a low,\nquavering voice repeated what her father had said. Being a woman, she\nwas allowed by the woman-wise magistrate to tell her story in her own\nway. When she spoke of the attempted murder at the taffrail, her manner\nbecame excited. Then she told of the captain's promise to put the man in\nirons on her agreeing to testify against him--of the consequent decrease\nin her watchfulness, and her missing the child just before the\nshipwreck--of her rescue by the gallant first officer, and his assertion\nthat he had seen her child in the arms of this man--the only man on\nearth who would harm it--of the later news that a boat containing\nsailors and children had been picked up by a Mediterranean steamer--of\nthe detectives sent over, and their report that a sailor answering this\nman's description had refused to surrender a child to the consul at\nGibraltar and had disappeared with it--of her joy at the news that Myra\nwas alive, and despair of ever seeing her again until she had met her in\nthis man's arms on Broadway the day before. At this point, outraged\nmaternity overcame her. With cheeks flushed, and eyes blazing scorn and\nanger, she pointed at Rowland and all but screamed: \"And he has\nmutilated--tortured my baby. There are deep wounds in her little back,\nand the doctor said, only last night, that they were made by a sharp\ninstrument. And he must have tried to warp and twist the mind of my\nchild, or put her through frightful experiences; for he has taught her\nto swear--horribly--and last night at bedtime, when I told her the story\nof Elisha and the bears and the children, she burst out into the most\nuncontrollable screaming and sobbing.\"\n\nHere her testimony ended in a breakdown of hysterics, between sobs of\nwhich were frequent admonitions to the child not to say that bad word;\nfor Myra had caught sight of Rowland and was calling his nickname.\n\n\"What shipwreck was this--where was it?\" asked the puzzled magistrate of\nnobody in particular.\n\n\"The _Titan_,\" called out half a dozen newspaper men across the room.\n\n\"The _Titan_,\" repeated the magistrate. \"Then this offense was committed\non the high seas under the English flag. I cannot imagine why it is\nbrought into this court. Prisoner, have you anything to say?\"\n\n\"Nothing, your Honor.\" The answer came in a kind of dry sob.\n\nThe magistrate scanned the ashen-faced man in rags, and said to the\nclerk of the court: \"Change this charge to vagrancy--eh--\"\n\nThe clerk, instigated by the newspaper men, was at his elbow. He laid a\nmorning paper before him, pointed to certain big letters and retired.\nThen the business of the court suspended while the court read the news.\nAfter a moment or two the magistrate looked up.\n\n\"Prisoner,\" he said, sharply, \"take your left sleeve out of your\nbreast!\" Rowland obeyed mechanically, and it dangled at his side. The\nmagistrate noticed, and read on. Then he folded the paper and said:\n\n\"You are the man who was rescued from an iceberg, are you not?\" The\nprisoner bowed his head.\n\n\"Discharged!\" The word came forth in an unjudicial roar. \"Madam,\" added\nthe magistrate, with a kindling light in his eye, \"this man has merely\nsaved your child's life. If you will read of his defending it from a\npolar bear when you go home, I doubt that you will tell it any more bear\nstories. Sharp instrument--umph!\" Which was equally unjudicial on the\npart of the court.\n\nMrs. Selfridge, with a mystified and rather aggrieved expression of\nface, left the court-room with her indignant father and friends, while\nMyra shouted profanely for Rowland, who had fallen into the hands of the\nreporters. They would have entertained him after the manner of the\ncraft, but he would not be entertained--neither would he talk. He\nescaped and was swallowed up in the world without; and when the evening\npapers appeared that day, the events of the trial were all that could be\nadded to the story of the morning.\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nOn the morning of the next day, a one-armed dock lounger found an old\nfish-hook and some pieces of string which he knotted together; then he\ndug some bait and caught a fish. Being hungry and without fire, he\ntraded with a coaster's cook for a meal, and before night caught two\nmore, one of which he traded, the other, sold. He slept under the\ndocks--paying no rent--fished, traded, and sold for a month, then paid\nfor a second-hand suit of clothes and the services of a barber. His\nchanged appearance induced a boss stevedore to hire him tallying cargo,\nwhich was more lucrative than fishing, and furnished, in time, a hat,\npair of shoes, and an overcoat. He then rented a room and slept in a\nbed. Before long he found employment addressing envelopes for a mailing\nfirm, at which his fine and rapid penmanship secured him steady work;\nand in a few months he asked his employers to indorse his application\nfor a Civil Service examination. The favor was granted, the examination\neasily passed, and he addressed envelopes while he waited. Meanwhile he\nbought new and better clothing and seemed to have no difficulty in\nimpressing those whom he met with the fact that he was a gentleman. Two\nyears from the time of his examination he was appointed to a lucrative\nposition under the Government, and as he seated himself at the desk in\nhis office, could have been heard to remark: \"Now John Rowland, your\nfuture is your own. You have merely suffered in the past from a mistaken\nestimate of the importance of women and whisky.\"\n\nBut he was wrong, for in six months he received a letter which, in part,\nread as follows:\n\n    \"Do not think me indifferent or ungrateful. I have watched from a\n    distance while you made your wonderful fight for your old standards.\n    You have won, and I am glad and I congratulate you. But Myra will\n    not let me rest. She asks for you continually and cries at times. I\n    can bear it no longer. Will you not come and see Myra?\"\n\nAnd the man went to see--Myra.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PIRATES\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nTwo young men met in front of the post-office of a small country town.\nThey were of about the same age--eighteen--each was well dressed,\ncomely, and apparently of good family; and each had an expression of\nface that would commend him to strangers, save that one of them, the\nlarger of the two, had what is called a \"bad eye\"--that is, an eye\nshowing just a little too much white above the iris. In the other's eye\nwhite predominated below the iris. The former is usually the index of\nviolent though restrained temper; the latter of an intuitive, psychic\ndisposition, with very little self-control. The difference in character\nso indicated may lead one person to the Presidency, another to the\ngallows. And--though no such results are promised--with similar\ndivergence of path, of pain and pleasure, of punishment and reward, is\nthis story concerned.\n\nThe two boys were schoolmates and friends, with never a quarrel since\nthey had known each other; they had graduated together from the high\nschool, but neither had been valedictorian. They later had sought the\ncompetitive examination given by the congressman of the district for an\nappointment to the Naval Academy, and had won out over all, but so close\ntogether that the congressman had decreed another test.\n\nThey had taken it, and since then had waited for the letter that named\nthe winner; hence the daily visits to the post-office, ending in this\none, when the larger boy, about to go up the steps, met the smaller\ncoming down with an opened letter, and smiling.\n\n\"I've got it, Jack,\" said the smaller boy, joyously. \"Here it is. I win,\nbut, of course, you're the alternate. Read it.\"\n\nHe handed the letter to Jack, but it was declined.\n\n\"What's the use?\" was the somewhat sulky response. \"I've lost, sure\nenough. All I've got to do is to forget it.\"\n\n\"Then let me read it to you,\" said the winner, eagerly. \"I want you to\nfeel glad about it--same as I would if you had passed first. Listen:\n\n    \"'MR. WILLIAM DENMAN.\n\n    \"'DEAR SIR: I am glad to inform you that you have successfully\n    passed the second examination for an appointment to the Naval\n    Academy, winning by three points in history over the other\n    contestant, Mr. John Forsythe, who, of course, is the alternate in\n    case you do not pass the entrance examination at Annapolis.\n\n    \"'Be ready at any time for instructions from the Secretary of the\n    Navy to report at Annapolis. Sincerely yours,\n                                                        JACOB BLAND.'\"\n\n\"What do I care for that?\" said Forsythe. \"I suppose I've got a letter\nin there, too. Let's see.\"\n\nWhile Denman waited, Forsythe entered the post-office, and soon emerged,\nreading a letter.\n\n\"Same thing,\" he said. \"I failed by three points in my special study.\nHow is it, Bill?\" he demanded, fiercely, as his disappointment grew upon\nhim. \"I've beaten not only you, but the whole class from the primary up,\nin history, ancient, modern, and local, until now. There's something\ncrooked here.\" His voice sank to a mutter.\n\n\"Crooked, Jack! What are you talking about?\" replied Denman, hotly.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, Bill. Never mind. Come on, if you're going home.\"\n\nThey walked side by side in the direction of their homes--near together\nand on the outskirts of the town--each busy with his thoughts. Denman,\nthough proud and joyous over the prize he had won, was yet hurt by the\nspeech and manner of Forsythe, and hurt still further by the darkening\ncloud on his face as they walked on.\n\nForsythe's thoughts were best indicated by his suddenly turning toward\nDenman and blurting out:\n\n\"Yes, I say; there's something crooked in this. I can beat you in\nhistory any day in the week, but your dad and old Bland are close\nfriends. I see it now.\"\n\nDenman turned white as he answered:\n\n\"Do you want me to report your opinion to my father and Mr. Bland?\"\n\n\"Oh, you would, would you? And take from me the alternate, too! Well,\nyou're a cur, Bill Denman. Go ahead and report.\"\n\nThey were now on a block bounded by vacant lots, and no one was within\nsight. Denman stopped, threw off his coat, and said:\n\n\"No, I'll not report your opinion, but--you square yourself, Jack\nForsythe, and I'll show you the kind of cur I am.\"\n\nForsythe turned, saw the anger in Denman's eyes, and promptly shed his\ncoat.\n\nIt was a short fight, of one round only. Each fought courageously, and\nwith such fistic skill as schoolboys acquire, and each was equal to the\nother in strength; but one possessed about an inch longer reach than the\nother, which decided the battle.\n\nDenman, with nose bleeding and both eyes closing, went down at last, and\ncould not arise, nor even see the necessity of rising. But soon his\nbrain cleared, and he staggered to his feet, his head throbbing\nviciously and his face and clothing smeared with blood from his nose,\nto see between puffed eyelids the erect figure of Forsythe swaggering\naround a distant corner. He stanched the blood with his handkerchief,\nbut as there was not a brook, a ditch, or a puddle in the neighborhood,\nhe could only go home as he was, trusting that he would meet no one.\n\n\"Licked!\" he muttered. \"For the first time in my life, too! What'll the\nold gentleman and mother say?\"\n\nWhat the father and mother might say, or what they did say, has no part\nin this story; but what another person said may have a place and value,\nand will be given here. This person was the only one he met before\nreaching home--a very small person, about thirteen years old, with big\ngray eyes and long dark ringlets, who ran across the street to look at\nhim.\n\n\"Why, Billie Denman!\" she cried, shocked and anxious. \"What has happened\nto you? Run over?\"\n\n\"No, Florrie,\" he answered, painfully. \"I've been licked. I had a\nfight.\"\n\n\"But don't you know it's wrong to fight, Billie?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" answered Denman, trying to get more blood from his face to the\nalready saturated handkerchief. \"But we all do wrong--sometimes.\"\n\nThe child planted herself directly before him, and looked chidingly into\nhis discolored and disfigured face.\n\n\"Billie Denman,\" she said, shaking a small finger at him, \"of course I'm\nsorry, but, if you have been fighting when you know it is wrong,\nwhy--why, it served you right.\"\n\nHad he not been aching in every joint, his nose, his lips, and his eyes,\nthis unjust speech might have amused him. As it was he answered testily:\n\n\"Florence Fleming, you're only a kid yet, though the best one I know;\nand if I should tell you the name I was called and which brought on the\nfight, you would not understand. But you'll grow up some day, and then\nyou will understand. Now, remember this fight, and when some woman, or\npossibly some man, calls you a--a cat, you'll feel like fighting, too.\"\n\n\"But I wouldn't mind,\" she answered, firm in her position. \"Papa called\nme a kitten to-day, and I didn't get mad.\"\n\n\"Well, Florrie,\" he said, wearily, \"I won't try to explain. I'm going\naway before long, and perhaps I won't come back again. But if I do,\nthere'll be another fight.\"\n\n\"Going away, Billie!\" she cried in alarm. \"Where to?\"\n\n\"To Annapolis. I may stay, or I may come back. I don't know.\"\n\n\"And you are going away, and you don't know that you'll come back! Oh,\nBillie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry you got licked, too. Who did it? I hate\nhim. Who licked you, Billie?\"\n\n\"Never mind, Florrie. He'll tell the news, and you'll soon know who he\nis.\"\n\nHe walked on, but the child headed him and faced him. There were tears\nin the gray eyes.\n\n\"And you're going away, Billie!\" she exclaimed again. \"When are you\ngoing?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered. \"Whenever I am sent for. If I don't see you\nagain, good-by, Florrie girl.\" He stooped to kiss her, but straightened\nup, remembering the condition of his face.\n\n\"But I will see you again,\" she declared. \"I will, I will. I'll come to\nyour house. And, Billie--I'm sorry I scolded you, really I am.\"\n\nHe smiled ruefully. \"Never mind that, Florrie; you always scolded me,\nyou know, and I'm used to it.\"\n\n\"But only when you did wrong, Billie,\" she answered, gravely, \"and\nsomehow I feel that this time you have not done wrong. But I won't scold\nthe next time you _really_ do wrong. I promise.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you will, little girl. It's the privilege and prerogative of\nyour sex.\"\n\nHe patted her on the head and went on, leaving her staring, open-eyed\nand tearful. She was the child of a neighbor; he had mended her dolls,\nsoothed her griefs, and protected her since infancy, but she was only as\na small sister to him.\n\nWhile waiting for orders to Annapolis, he saw her many times, but she\ndid not change to him. She changed, however; she had learned the name of\nhis assailant, and through her expressed hatred for him, and through her\nsympathy for Billie as the disfigurements left his face, she passed the\nborder between childhood and womanhood.\n\nWhen orders came, he stopped at her home, kissed her good-by, and went\nto Annapolis, leaving her sad-eyed and with quivering lips.\n\nAnd he did not come back.\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nShe was the largest, fastest, and latest thing in seagoing destroyers,\nand though the specifications called for but thirty-six knots' speed,\nshe had made thirty-eight on her trial trip, and later, under careful\nnursing by her engineers, she had increased this to forty knots an\nhour--five knots faster than any craft afloat--and, with a clean bottom,\nthis speed could be depended upon at any time it was needed.\n\nShe derived this speed from six water-tube boilers, feeding at a\npressure of three hundred pounds live steam to five turbine engines\nworking three screws, one high-pressure turbine on the center shaft,\nand four low-pressure on the wing shafts. Besides these she possessed\ntwo \"astern\" turbines and two cruising turbines--all four on the wing\nshafts.\n\nShe made steam with oil fuel, there being no coal on board except for\nheating and cooking, and could carry a hundred and thirty tons of it,\nwhich gave her a cruising radius of about two thousand miles; also, with\n\"peace tanks\" filled, she could steam three thousand miles without\nreplenishing. This would carry her across the Atlantic at thirteen\nknots' speed, but if she was in a hurry, using all turbines, she would\nexhaust her oil in two days.\n\nWhen in a hurry, she was a spectacle to remember. Built on conventional\nlines, she showed at a mile's distance nothing but a high bow and four\nshort funnels over a mighty bow wave that hid the rest of her long,\ndark-hued hull, and a black, horizontal cloud of smoke that stretched\nastern half a mile before the wind could catch and rend it.\n\nShe carried four twenty-one-inch torpedo tubes and a battery of six\ntwelve-pounder, rapid-fire guns; also, she carried two large\nsearchlights and a wireless equipment of seventy miles reach, the\na\u00c3\u00abrials of which stretched from the truck of her short signal mast aft\nto a short pole at the taffrail.\n\nPacked with machinery, she was a \"hot box,\" even when at rest, and when\nin action a veritable bake oven. She had hygienic air space below decks\nfor about a dozen men, and this number could handle her; but she carried\nberths and accommodations for sixty.\n\nHer crew was not on board, however. Newly scraped and painted in the dry\ndock, she had been hauled out, stored, and fueled by a navy-yard gang,\nand now lay at the dock, ready for sea--ready for her draft of men in\nthe morning, and with no one on board for the night but the executive\nofficer, who, with something on his mind, had elected to remain, while\nthe captain and other commissioned officers went ashore for the night.\n\nFour years at the Naval Academy, a two years' sea cruise, and a year of\nactual service had made many changes in Denman. He was now twenty-five,\nan ensign, but, because of his position as executive, bearing the\ncomplimentary title of lieutenant.\n\nHe was a little taller and much straighter and squarer of shoulder than\nwhen he had gone to the academy. He had grown a trim mustache, and the\nsun and winds of many seas had tanned his face to the color of his eyes;\nwhich were of a clear brown, and only in repose did they now show the\nold-time preponderance of white beneath the brown.\n\nIn action these eyes looked out through two slits formed by nearly\nparallel eyelids, and with the tightly closed lips and high arching\neyebrows--sure sign of the highest and best form of physical and moral\ncourage--they gave his face a sort of \"take care\" look, which most men\nheeded.\n\nSome women would have thought him handsome, some would not; it all\ndepended upon the impression they made on him, and the consequent look\nin his eyes.\n\nAt Annapolis he had done well; he was the most popular man of his class,\nhad won honors from his studies and fist fights from his fellows, while\nat sea he had shown a reckless disregard for his life, in such matters\nas bursting flues, men overboard, and other casualties of seafaring,\nthat brought him many type-written letters from Washington, a few\nnumbers of advancement, and the respect and admiration of all that knew\nor had heard of him.\n\nHis courage, like Mrs. C\u00c3\u00a6sar's morals, was above suspicion. Yet there\nwas one man in the world who was firmly convinced that Lieutenant\nDenman had a yellow streak in him, and that man was Denman himself.\n\nHe had never been home since his departure for Annapolis. He had\npromised a small girl that if he came back there would be another fight,\nin which, as he mentally vowed, he would redeem himself. In this he had\nbeen sincere, but as the months at the academy went on, with the\nunsettled fight still in the future, his keen resentment died away,\nleaving in its place a sense of humiliation and chagrin.\n\nHe still meant to go back, however, and would have done so when vacation\ncame; but a classmate invited him to his home, and there he went, glad\nof the reprieve from an embarrassing, and, as it seemed to him now, an\nundignified conflict with a civilian. But the surrender brought its\nsting, and his self-respect lessened.\n\nAt the next vacation he surrendered again, and the sting began eating\ninto his soul. He thought of the overdue redemption he had promised\nhimself at all times and upon all occasions, but oftenest just before\ngoing to sleep, when the mental picture of Jack Forsythe swaggering\naround the corner, while _he_ lay conquered and helpless on the ground,\nwould accompany him through his dreams, and be with him when he wakened\nin the morning.\n\nIt became an obsession, and very soon the sudden thought of his coming\nfight with Forsythe brought the uplift of the heart and the slight\nchoking sensation that betokened nothing but fear.\n\nHe would not admit it at first, but finally was compelled to. Honest\nwith himself as he was with others, he finally yielded in the mental\nstruggle, and accepted the dictum of his mind. He was afraid to fight\nJack Forsythe, with no reference to, or regard for, his standing as an\nofficer and a gentleman.\n\nBut now, it seemed, all this was to leave him. A month before, he had\nthought strongly of his child friend Florrie, and, with nothing to do\none afternoon, he had written her a letter--a jolly, rollicking letter,\nfilled with masculine colloquialisms and friendly endearments, such as\nhe had bestowed upon her at home; and it was the dignity of her\nreply--received that day--with the contents of the letter, which was the\n\"something on his mind\" that kept him aboard.\n\nHis cheeks burned as he realized that she was now about twenty years\nold, a young lady, and that his letter to her had been sadly conceived\nand much out of place. But the news in the letter, which began with\n\"Dear Sir,\" and ended with \"Sincerely yours,\" affected him most. It\nread:\n\n    \"I presume you know that your enemy, Jack Forsythe, took his\n    disappointment so keenly that he never amounted to much at home, and\n    about two years ago enlisted in the navy. This relieves you, as\n    father tells me, from the necessity of thrashing him--as you\n    declared you would. Officers and enlisted men cannot fight, he said,\n    as the officer has the advantage, and can always order the man to\n    jail. I thank you very much for remembering me after all these\n    years--in fact, I shall never forget your kindness.\"\n\nHis cheeks and ears had burned all day, and when his fellow officers had\ngone, and he was alone, he reread the letter.\n\n\"Sarcasm and contempt between every line,\" he muttered. \"She expected\nme--the whole town expected me--to come back and lick that fellow.\nWell\"--his eyelids became rigidly parallel--\"I'll do it. When I find\nhim, I'll get shore leave for both of us, take him home, and square the\naccount.\"\n\nThis resolution did him good; the heat left his cheek, and the sudden\njump of the heart did not come with the occasional thought of the task.\nGradually the project took form; he would learn what ship Forsythe was\nin, get transferred to her, and when in port arrange the shore leave. He\ncould not fight him in the navy, but as man to man, in civilian's\nclothing in the town park, he would fight him and thrash him before the\npopulace.\n\nIt was late when he had finished the planning. He lighted a last cigar,\nand sauntered around the deck until the cigar was consumed. Then he went\nto his room and turned in, thinking of the caustic words of Miss\nFlorrie, forgiving her the while, and wondering how she looked--grown\nup.\n\nThey were pleasant thoughts to go to sleep on, but sleep did not come.\nIt was an intensely hot, muggy night, and the mosquitoes were thick. He\ntried another room, then another, and at last, driven out of the\nwardroom by the pests, he took refuge in the steward's pantry, and\nspreading his blanket on the floor, went to sleep on it.\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nHe slept soundly, and as he slept the wind blew up from the east,\ndriving the mosquitoes to cover and bringing with it a damp,\nimpenetrable fog that sank down over the navy yard and hid sentry from\nsentry, compelling them to count their steps as they paced.\n\nThey were scattered through the yard, at various important points, one\nat the gangway of each ship at the docks, others at corners and\nentrances to the different walks that traversed the green lawn, and\nothers under the walls of the huge naval prison.\n\nOne of these, whose walk extended from corner to corner, heard\nsomething, and paused often to listen intently, his eyes peering around\ninto the fog. But the sound was not repeated while he listened--only as\nhis footfalls sounded soggily on the damp path were they punctuated by\nthis still, small sound, that he could not localize or remember.\n\nIf asked, he might have likened it to the rustling of paper, or the\nsound of a cat's claws digging into a carpet.\n\nBut at last it ceased, and he went back and forth many times without\nhearing it; then, when about half-way from corner to corner, a heavy\nbody came down from above, landing on his head and shoulders and bearing\nhim to earth, while his rifle was knocked from his hand and big fingers\nclutched his throat.\n\nHe struggled and endeavored to call out. But the grip on his throat was\ntoo strong, and finally he quieted, his last flicker of consciousness\ncognizing other dropping bodies and the muttered and whispered words of\nmen.\n\nSo much for this sentry.\n\n\"I know the way,\" whispered the garroter, and a few gathered around him.\n\"We'll make a bee line for the dock and avoid 'em. Then, if we can't\nfind a boat, we'll swim for it. It's the only way.\"\n\n\"Right,\" whispered another; \"fall in here, behind Jenkins--all of you.\"\n\nThe whispered word was passed along, and in single file the dark-brown\nbodies, each marked on knee and elbow with a white number, followed the\nleader, Jenkins. He led them across the green, around corners where\nsentries were not, and down to the dock where lay the destroyer.\n\nHere was a sentry, pacing up and down; but so still was their approach\nthat he did not see them until they were right upon him.\n\n\"Who goes--\" he started, but the challenge was caught in his throat. He,\ntoo, was choked until consciousness almost left him; then the stricture\nwas relaxed while they questioned him.\n\n\"Got a boat around here?\" hissed Jenkins in his ear. \"Whisper--don't\nspeak.\"\n\n\"No,\" gasped the sentry, unable to speak louder had he dared.\n\n\"How many men are aboard the destroyer?\" was asked.\n\n\"None now. Crew joins in the morning.\"\n\n\"Nobody on board, you say? Lie quiet. If you raise a row, I'll drop you\noverboard. Come here, you fellows.\"\n\nThey closed about him, thirteen in all, and listened to his project. He\nwas a pilot of the bay. How many machinists were there in the party?\nFour claimed the rating.\n\n\"Right enough,\" said Jenkins. \"We'll run her out. She's oil fuel, as I\nunderstand. You can fire up in ten minutes, can't you? Good. Come on.\nWait, though.\"\n\nJenkins, with his grip of steel, was equal to the task of tearing a\nstrip from his brown prison jacket, and with this he securely gagged the\npoor sentry. Another strip from another jacket bound his hands behind\nhim, and still another secured him to a mooring cleat, face upward. This\ndone, they silently filed aboard, and spread about through the interior.\nThe sentry had spoken truly, they agreed, when they mustered together.\nThere was no one on board, and the machinists reported plenty of oil\nfuel.\n\nSoon the fires were lighted, and the indicator began to move, as the\nboilers made steam. They did not wait for full pressure. Jenkins had\nspread out a chart in the pilot-house, and when the engines could turn\nover he gave the word. Lines were taken in except a spring to back on;\nthen this was cast off, and the long, slim hull moved almost silently\naway from the dock.\n\nJenkins steered by the light of a match held over the compass until\nthere was steam enough to turn the dynamos, then the electrics were\nturned on in the pilot-house, engine room, and side-light boxes--by\nwhich time the dock was out of sight in the fog, and they dared speak in\narticulate words. Their language was profane but joyous, and their\ncongratulations hearty and sincere.\n\nA table knife is an innocent and innocuous weapon, but two table knives\nare not, for one can be used against the other so skillfully as to form\na fairly good hack saw, with which prison bars may be sawed. The sawing\nof steel bars was the sound that the sentry had heard mingling with his\nfootfalls.\n\nJenkins, at the wheel, called to the crowd. \"Take the wheel, one of\nyou,\" he ordered. \"I've just rounded the corner. Keep her sou'east, half\nsouth for a mile. I'll be here, then. I want to rig the log over the\nstern.\"\n\nThe man answered, and Jenkins departed with the boat's patent log. Down\nin the engine and boiler rooms were the four machinists--engineers, they\nwould be called in merchant steamers--and under their efforts the\nengines turned faster, while a growing bow wave spread from each side of\nthe sharp stem.\n\nThe fog was still thick, so thick that the fan-shaped beams from the\nside lights could not pierce it as far as the bow, and the forward\nfunnel was barely visible--a magnified black stump.\n\nJenkins was back among them soon, remarking that she was making twenty\nknots already. Then he slowed down, ordered the lead hove, each side,\nand ringing full speed, quietly took the wheel, changing the course\nagain to east, quarter north, and ordering a man aloft to keep a lookout\nin the thinner fog for lights ahead.\n\nIn a few minutes the man reported--a fixed white light four points off\nthe starboard bow, and a little later a fixed white-and-red flashlight\ntwo points off the port bow.\n\n\"Good,\" grunted Jenkins. \"I know just where I am. Come down from aloft,\"\nhe called, \"and watch out for buoys. I'm going out the South and\nHypocrite Channels.\"\n\nThen a dull boom rang out from astern, followed by another and another,\nand Jenkins laughed.\n\n\"They've found that sentry,\" he said, \"and have telephoned Fort\nIndependence; but it's no good. They've only got salute guns. We passed\nthat fort twenty minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Any others?\" they asked.\n\n\"Fort Warren, down on the Narrows. That's why I'm going out through the\nHypocrite. Keep your eyes peeled for buoys, you ginks, and keep those\nleads going.\"\n\nCalm and imperturbable, a huge, square-faced giant of a man, Jenkins\nnaturally assumed the leadership of this band of jail-breakers. The\nlight from the binnacle illuminated a countenance of rugged yet\nsymmetrical features, stamped with prison pallor, but also stamped with\na stronger imprint of refinement. A man palpably out of place, no doubt.\nA square peg in a round hole; a man with every natural attribute of a\nmaster of men. Some act of rage or passion, perhaps, some non-adjustment\nto an unjust environment, had sent him to the naval prison, to escape\nand become a pirate; for that was the legal status of all.\n\nSoon the wind shifted and the fog cleared to seaward, but still held its\nimpenetrable wall between them and the town. Then they turned on both\nsearchlights, and saw buoys ahead, to starboard and port.\n\nJenkins boasted a little. \"I've run these channels for years,\" he said,\n\"and I know them as I know the old backyard at home. Hello, what's up?\"\n\nA man had run to the pilot-house door in great excitement.\n\n\"An officer aboard,\" he whispered. \"I was down looking for grub, and saw\nhim. He's been asleep.\"\n\n\"Take the wheel,\" said Jenkins, calmly. \"Keep her as she goes, and leave\nthat black buoy to starboard.\" Then he stepped out on deck.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nSeamen, officers as well as men, accustomed to \"watch and watch,\" of\nfour hours' alternate duty and sleep, usually waken at eight bells, even\nwhen sure of an all night's sleep. It was long after midnight when\nDenman had gone to sleep on the pantry floor, and the slight noise of\ngetting under way did not arouse him; but when eight bells came around\nagain, he sat up, confused, not conscious that he had been called, but\ndimly realizing that the boat was at sea, and that he was culpable in\nnot being on deck.\n\nThe crew had come, no doubt, and he had over-slept. He did not\nimmediately realize that it was still dark, and that if the crew had\ncome the steward would have found him.\n\nHe dressed hurriedly in his room, and went on deck, spying a fleeing man\nin brown mounting the steps ahead of him, and looked around. Astern was\na fog bank, and ahead the open sea, toward which the boat was charging\nat full speed. As he looked, a man came aft and faced him. Denman\nexpected that he would step aside while he passed, but he did not;\ninstead he blocked his way.\n\n\"Are you an officer of this boat, sir?\" asked the man, respectfully.\n\n\"I am. What do you want?\"\n\n\"Only to tell you, sir, that she is not now under the control of the\nNavy Department. My name is Jenkins, and with twelve others I escaped\nfrom the prison to-night, and took charge of this boat for a while. We\ndid not know you were on board.\"\n\nDenman started back and felt for his pocket pistol, but it was in his\nroom. However, Jenkins had noticed the movement, and immediately sprang\nupon him, bearing him against the nearest ventilator, and pinioning his\narms to his side.\n\n\"None o' that, sir,\" said the giant, sternly. \"Are there any others on\nboard besides yourself?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" answered Denman, with forced calmness. \"The crew\nhad not joined when I went to sleep. What do you intend to do with me?\"\n\nHe had seen man after man approach from forward, and now a listening\ngroup surrounded him.\n\n\"That's for you to decide, sir. If you will renounce your official\nposition, we will put you on parole; if you will not, you will be\nconfined below decks until we are ready to leave this craft. All we want\nis our liberty.\"\n\n\"How do you intend to get it? Every warship in the world will chase this\nboat.\"\n\n\"There is not a craft in the world that can catch her,\" rejoined\nJenkins; \"but that is beside the point. Will you go on parole, sir, or\nin irons?\"\n\n\"How many are there in this party?\"\n\n\"Thirteen--all told; and that, too, is beside the point. Answer quickly,\nsir. I am needed at the wheel.\"\n\n\"I accept your offer,\" said Denman, \"because I want fresh air, and\nnothing will be gained in honor and integrity in my resisting you.\nHowever, I shall not assist you in any way. Even if I see you going to\ndestruction, I shall not warn you.\"\n\n\"That is enough, sir,\" answered Jenkins. \"You give your word of honor,\ndo you, as an American naval officer, not to interfere with the working\nof this boat or the movements of her crew until after we have left her?\"\n\n\"I give you my word,\" said the young officer, not without some\nmisgivings. \"You seem to be in command. What shall I call you?\"\n\n\"Herbert Jenkins, seaman gunner.\"\n\n\"Captain Jenkins,\" growled a man, and others repeated it.\n\n\"Captain Jenkins,\" responded Denman, \"I greet you cordially. My name is\nWilliam Denman, ensign in the United States Navy, and formally executive\nofficer of this boat.\"\n\nA suppressed exclamation came from the group; a man stepped forward,\npeered closely into Denman's face, and stepped back.\n\n\"None o' that, Forsythe,\" said Jenkins, sternly. \"We're all to treat Mr.\nDenman with respect. Now, you fellows, step forward, and introduce\nyourselves. I know only a few of you by name.\"\n\nJenkins went to the wheel, picked up the buoys played upon by the\nsearchlights, and sent the man to join the others, as one after another\nfaced Denman and gave his name.\n\n\"Guess you know me, Mr. Denman,\" said Forsythe, the first to respond.\n\n\"I know you, Forsythe,\" answered Denman, hot and ashamed; for at the\nsight and sound of him the old heart jump and throat ache had returned.\nHe fought it down, however, and listened to the names as the men gave\nthem: William Hawkes, seaman; George Davis, seaman; John Kelly, gunner's\nmate; Percy Daniels, ship's cook, and Thomas Billings, wardroom\nsteward.\n\nJohn Casey and Frank Munson, they explained, were at the searchlights\nforward; and down below were the four machinists, Riley, Sampson, King,\nand Dwyer.\n\nDenman politely bowed his acknowledgments, and asked the ratings of the\nsearchlight men.\n\n\"Wireless operators,\" they answered.\n\n\"You seem well-equipped and well-chosen men,\" he said, \"to run this\nboat, and to lead the government a lively dance for a while. But until\nthe end comes, I hope we will get on together without friction.\"\n\nIn the absence of the masterful Jenkins, they made embarrassed\nreplies--all but Forsythe, who remained silent. For no sudden upheaval\nand reversing of relations will eliminate the enlisted man's respect for\nan officer.\n\nDaylight had come, and Jenkins, having cleared the last of the buoys,\ncalled down the men at the searchlights.\n\n\"You're wireless sharps, aren't you?\" he asked. \"Go down to the\napparatus, and see if you can pick up any messages. The whole coast must\nbe aroused.\"\n\nThe two obeyed him, and went in search of the wireless room. Soon one\nreturned. \"The air's full o' talk,\" he said. \"Casey's at the receiver,\nstill listening, but I made out only a few words like 'Charleston,'\n'Brooklyn,' 'jail,' 'pirates,' 'Pensacola,' and one phrasing 'Send in\npursuit.'\"\n\n\"The open sea for us,\" said Jenkins, grimly, \"until we can think out a\nplan. Send one of those sogers to the wheel.\"\n\nA \"soger\"--one who, so far, had done no work--relieved him, and he\nmustered his men, all but two in the engine room, to a council\namidships. Briefly he stated the situation, as hinted at by Denman and\nverified by the wireless messages. Every nation in the world would send\nits cruisers after them, and no civilized country would receive them.\n\nThere was but one thing to do under the circumstances--make for the wild\ncoast of Africa, destroy the boat, and land, each man to work out his\nfuture as he could.\n\nAfter a little parley they assented, taking no thought of fuel or food,\nand trusting to Jenkins' power to navigate. Then, it being broad\ndaylight, they raided the boat's stores for clothing, and discarded\ntheir prison suits of brown for the blue of the navy--Jenkins, the\nlogical commander, donning the uniform of the captain, as large a man as\nhimself.\n\nNext they chose their bunks in the forecastle, and, as they left it for\nthe deck, Jenkins picked up a bright object from the floor, and absently\nput it in his trousers pocket.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe boat was now charging due east at full speed, out into the broad\nAtlantic, and, as the full light of the day spread over the sea, a few\nspecks and trails of smoke astern showed themselves; but whether or not\nthey were pursuing craft that had crept close in the darkness while they\nwere making steam could not be determined; for they soon sank beneath\nthe horizon.\n\nAssured of immediate safety, Jenkins now stationed his crew. Forsythe\nwas a seaman; he and Hawkes, Davis, and Kelly, the gunner's mate, would\ncomprise the deck force. Riley, Sampson, King, and Dwyer, all\nmachinists, would attend to the engine and boilers. Casey and Munson,\nthe two wireless operators, would attend to their department, while\nDaniels and Billings, the cook and steward, would cook and serve the\nmeals.\n\nThere would be no officers, Jenkins declared. All were to stand watch,\nand work faithfully and amicably for the common good; and all disputes\nwere to be referred to him. To this they agreed, for, though many there\nwere of higher comparative rating in the navy, Jenkins had a strong\nvoice, a dominating personality, and a heavy fist.\n\nBut Jenkins had his limitations, as came out during the confab. He could\nnot navigate; he had been an expert pilot of Boston Bay before joining\nthe navy, but in the open sea he was as helpless as any.\n\n\"However,\" he said, in extenuation, \"we only need to sail about\nsoutheast to reach the African coast, and when we hit it we'll know it.\"\nSo the course was changed, and soon they sat down to their breakfast;\nsuch a meal as they had not tasted in years--wardroom \"grub,\" every\nmouthful.\n\nDenman was invited, and, as he was a prisoner on parole, was not too\ndignified to accept, though he took no part in the hilarious\nconversation. But neither did Forsythe.\n\nDenman went to his room, locked up his private papers, and surrendered\nhis revolver to Jenkins, who declined it; he then put it with his papers\nand returned to the deck, seating himself in a deck chair on the\nquarter. The watch below had gone down, and those on deck, under\nJenkins, who stood no watch, busied themselves in the necessary cleaning\nup of decks and stowing below of the fenders the boat had worn at the\ndock.\n\nForsythe had gone below, and Denman was somewhat glad in his heart to be\nfree of him until he had settled his mind in regard to his attitude\ntoward him.\n\nManifestly he, a prisoner on parole, could not seek a conflict with\nhim. On the contrary, should Forsythe seek it, by word or deed, he could\nnot meet him without breaking his parole, which would bring him close\nconfinement.\n\nThen, too, that prospective fight and vindication before Miss Florrie\nand his townsmen seemed of very small importance compared with the\nexigency at hand--the stealing by jail-breakers of the navy's best\ndestroyer and one of its officers.\n\nHis duty was to circumvent those fellows, and return the boat to the\ngovernment. To accomplish this he must be tactful and diplomatic,\ndeferring action until the time should come when he could safely ask to\nbe released from parole; and with regard to this he was glad that\nForsythe, though as evil-eyed as before, and with an additional\ntruculent expression of the face, had thus far shown him no incivility.\nHe was glad, too, because in his heart there were no revengeful thoughts\nabout Forsythe--nothing but thoughts of a duty to himself that had been\nsadly neglected.\n\nThus tranquilized, he lit a cigar and looked around the horizon.\n\nA speck to the north caught his eye, and as he watched, it became a\nspot, then a tangible silhouette--a battle-ship, though of what country\nhe could not determine.\n\nIt was heading on a course that would intercept their own, and in a\nshort time, at the speed they were making, the destroyer would be within\nrange of her heavy guns, one shell from which could break the frail\ncraft in two.\n\nJenkins and his crowd were busy, the man at the wheel was steering by\ncompass and looking ahead, and it was the wireless operator on\nwatch--Casey--who rushed on deck, looked at the battle-ship, and shouted\nto Jenkins.\n\n\"Don't you see that fellow?\" he yelled, excitedly. \"I heard him before I\nsaw him. He asked: 'What ship is that?'\"\n\nJenkins looked to the north, just in time to see a tongue of red dart\nfrom a casemate port; then, as the bark of the gun came down the wind, a\nspurt of water lifted from the sea about a hundred yards ahead.\n\n\"Port your wheel--hard over,\" yelled Jenkins, running forward. The\ndestroyer swung to the southward, showing her stern to the battle-ship,\nand increasing her speed as the engine-room staff nursed the oil feed\nand the turbines. Black smoke--unconsumed carbon that even the blowers\ncould not ignite--belched up from the four short funnels, and partly hid\nher from the battle-ship's view.\n\nBut, obscure though she was, she could not quite hide herself in her\nsmoke nor could her speed carry her faster than the twelve-inch shells\nthat now came plowing through the air. They fell close, to starboard and\nto port, and a few came perilously near to the stern; but none hit or\nexploded, and soon they were out of range and the firing ceased, the\nbattle-ship heading to the west.\n\nJenkins came aft, and looked sternly at Denman, still smoking his cigar.\n\n\"Did you see that fellow before we did?\" he asked.\n\n\"I did,\" answered Denman, returning his stare.\n\n\"Why didn't you sing out? If we're sunk, you drown, too, don't you?\"\n\n\"You forget, Captain Jenkins, that I accepted my parole on condition\nthat I should neither interfere with you nor assist you.\"\n\n\"But your life--don't you value that?\"\n\n\"Not under some conditions. If I cannot emerge from this adventure with\ncredit and honor intact, I prefer death. Do you understand?\"\n\nJenkins' face worked visibly, as anger left it and wondering doubt\nappeared. Then his countenance cleared, and he smiled.\n\n\"You're right, sir. I understand now. But you know what we mean to do,\ndon't you? Make the African coast and scatter. You can stand for that,\ncan't you?\"\n\n\"Not unless I have to. But you will not reach the coast. You will be\nhunted down and caught before then.\"\n\nJenkins' face clouded again. \"And what part will you play if that\ncomes?\" he asked.\n\n\"No part, active or resistant, unless first released from parole. But if\nI ask for that release, it will be at a time when I am in greater danger\nthan now, I promise you that.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir. Ask for it when you like.\" And Jenkins went forward.\n\nThe course to the southeast was resumed, but in half an hour two other\nspecks on the southern horizon resolved into scout cruisers heading\ntheir way, and they turned to the east, still rushing at full speed.\n\nThey soon dropped the scouts, however, but were again driven to the\nnorth by a second battle-ship that shelled their vicinity for an hour\nbefore they got out of range.\n\nIt was somewhat discouraging; but, as darkness closed down, they once\nmore headed their course, and all night they charged along at forty\nknots, with lights extinguished, but with every man's eyes searching the\ndarkened horizon for other lights. They dodged a few, but daylight\nbrought to view three cruisers ahead and to port that showed\nunmistakable hostility in the shape of screaming shells and solid shot.\n\nAgain they charged to the north, and it was mid-day before the cruisers\nwere dropped. They were French, as all knew by their build.\n\nThough there was no one navigating the boat, Denman, in view of future\nneed of it, took upon himself the winding of the chronometers; and the\ndays went on, Casey and Munson reporting messages sent from shore to\nship; battle-ships, cruisers, scouts, and destroyers appearing and\ndisappearing, and their craft racing around the Atlantic like a hunted\nfox.\n\nJenkins did his best to keep track of the various courses; but, not\nskilled at \"traverse,\" grew bewildered at last, and frankly intimated\nthat he did not know where they were.\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nOne morning there was a council of war amidships to which Denman was not\ninvited until it had adjourned as a council to become a committee of\nways and means. Then they came aft in a body, and asked him to navigate.\n\n\"No,\" said Denman, firmly, rising to his feet and facing them. \"I will\nnot navigate unless you surrender this craft to me, and work her back to\nBoston, where you will return to the prison.\"\n\n\"Well, we won't do that,\" shouted several, angrily.\n\n\"Wait, you fellows,\" said Jenkins, firmly, \"and speak respectfully to an\nofficer, while he acts like one. Mr. Denman, your position need not be\nchanged for the worse. You can command this boat and all hands if you\nwill take us to the African coast.\"\n\n\"My _position_ would be changed,\" answered Denman. \"If I command this\nboat, I take her back to Boston, not to the African coast.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Jenkins, a shade of disappointment on his face.\n\"We cannot force you to join us, or help us; so--well, come forward, you\nfellows.\"\n\n\"Say, Jenkins!\" broke in Forsythe. \"You're doing a lot of dictating\nhere, and I've wondered why! Who gave you the right to decide? You admit\nyour incompetency; you can't navigate, can you?\"\n\n\"No, I cannot,\" retorted Jenkins, flushing. \"Neither can I learn, at my\nage. Neither can you.\"\n\n\"I can't?\" stormed Forsythe, his eyes glaring white as he glanced from\nJenkins to Denman and back. \"Well, I'll tell you I can. I tell you I\nhaven't forgotten all I learned at school, and that I can pick up\nnavigation without currying favor from this milk-fed thief. You know\nwell\"--he advanced and held his fist under Denman's face--\"that I won\nthe appointment you robbed me of, and that the uniform you wear belongs\nto me.\"\n\nAt the first word Denman's heart gave the old, familiar thump and jump\ninto his throat. Then came a quick reaction--a tingling at the hair\nroots, an opening of the eyes, followed by their closing to narrow\nslits, and, with the full weight of his body behind, he crashed his fist\ninto Forsythe's face, sending him reeling and whirling to the deck.\n\nHe would have followed, to repeat the punishment, but the others stopped\nhim. In an intoxication of ecstasy at the unexpected adjustment of his\nmental poise, he struck out again and again, and floored three or four\nof them before Jenkins backed him against the companion.\n\n\"He's broken his parole--put him in irons--chuck him overboard,\" they\nchorused, and closed around him threateningly, though Forsythe, his hand\nto his face, remained in the background.\n\n\"That's right, sir,\" said Jenkins, holding Denman at the end of one\nlong arm. \"You have violated your agreement with us, and we must\nconsider you a prisoner under confinement.\"\n\n\"All right,\" panted Denman. \"Iron me, if you like, but first form a ring\nand let me thrash that dog. He thrashed me at school when I was the\nsmaller and weaker. I've promised him a licking. Let me give it to him.\"\n\n\"No, sir, we will not,\" answered Jenkins. \"Things are too serious for\nfighting. You must hand me that pistol and any arms you may have, and be\nconfined to the wardroom. And you, Forsythe,\" he said, looking at the\nvictim, \"if you can master navigation, get busy and make good. And you\nother ginks get out of here. Talk it over among yourselves, and if you\nagree with Forsythe that I'm not in command here, get busy, too, and\nI'll overrule you.\"\n\nHe released Denman, moved around among them, looking each man steadily\nin the face, and they straggled forward.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" he said to Denman, \"come below.\"\n\nDenman followed him down the companion and into the wardroom. Knowing\nthe etiquette as well as Jenkins, he led him to his room, opened his\ndesk and all receptacles, and Jenkins secured the revolver.\n\n\"Is this all you have, sir?\" asked Jenkins.\n\n\"Why do you ask that?\" answered Denman, hotly. \"As a prisoner, why may I\nnot lie to you?\"\n\n\"Because, Mr. Denman, I think you wouldn't. However, I won't ask; I'll\nsearch this room and the whole boat, confiscating every weapon. You will\nhave the run of your stateroom and the wardroom, but will not be allowed\non deck. And you will not be annoyed, except perhaps to lend Forsythe\nany books he may want. He's the only educated man in the crowd.\"\n\n\"Better send him down under escort,\" responded Denman, \"if you want him\nback.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that'll be attended to. I've no part in your private affairs,\nsir; but you gave him one good one, and that ought to be enough for a\nwhile. If you tackle him again, you'll have the whole bunch at you.\nBetter let well enough alone.\"\n\nDenman sat down in his room, and Jenkins departed. Soon he came back\nwith three others--the steadiest men of the crew--and they made a\nsystematic search for weapons in the wardroom and all staterooms opening\nfrom it. Then they locked the doors leading to the captain's quarters\nand the doors leading forward, and went on deck, leaving Denman a\nprisoner, free to concoct any antagonistic plans that came to his mind.\n\nBut he made none, as yet; he was too well-contented and happy, not so\nmuch in being released from a somewhat false position as a prisoner\nunder parole as in the lifting of the burden of the years, the shame,\nhumiliation, chagrin, and anger dating from the school-day thrashing. He\nsmiled as he recalled the picture of Forsythe staggering along the deck.\nThe smile became a grin, then a soft chuckle, ending in joyous laughter;\nthen he applied the masculine leveler of all emotion--he smoked.\n\nThe staterooms--robbed of all weapons--were left open, and, as each room\ncontained a deadlight, or circular window, he had a view of the sea on\neach beam, but nothing ahead or astern; nor could he hear voices on deck\nunless pitched in a high key, for the men, their training strong upon\nthem, remained forward.\n\nThere was nothing on either horizon at present. The boat was storming\nalong to the southward, as he knew by a glance at the \"telltale\"\noverhead, and all seemed well with the runaways until a sudden stopping\nof the engines roused him up, to peer out the deadlights, and speculate\nas to what was ahead.\n\nBut he saw nothing, from either side, and strained his ears for sounds\nfrom the deck. There was excitement above. Voices from forward came to\nhim, muffled, but angry and argumentative. They grew louder as the men\ncame aft, and soon he could distinguish Jenkins' loud profanity,\ndrowning the protests of the others.\n\n\"She's afire and her boats are burned. There's a woman aboard. I tell\nyou we're not going to let 'em drown. Over with that boat, or I'll\nstretch some o' you out on deck-- Oh, you will, Forsythe?\"\n\nThen came a thud, as of the swift contact of two hard objects, and a\nsound as of a bag of potatoes falling to the deck, which told Denman\nthat some one had been knocked down.\n\n\"Go ahead with the machine, Sampson,\" said Jenkins again, \"and forward,\nthere. Port your wheel, and steer for the yacht.\"\n\nDenman sprang to a starboard deadlight and looked. He could now see,\nslantwise through the thick glass, a large steam yacht, afire from her\nmainmast to her bow, and on the still intact quarter-deck a woman\nfrantically beckoning. Men, nearer the fire, seemed to be fighting it.\n\nThe picture disappeared from view as the boat, under the impulse of her\nengines and wheel, straightened to a course for the wreck. Soon the\nengines stopped again, and Denman heard the sounds of a boat being\nlowered. He saw this boat leave the side, manned by Hawkes, Davis,\nForsythe, and Kelly, but it soon left his field of vision, and he\nwaited.\n\nThen came a dull, coughing, prolonged report, and the voices on deck\nbroke out.\n\n\"Blown up!\" yelled Jenkins. \"She's sinking forward! She's cut in two!\nWhere are they? Where's the woman? That wasn't powder, Riley. What was\nit?\"\n\n\"Steam,\" answered the machinist, coolly. \"They didn't rake the fires\nuntil too late, I suppose, and left the engine under one bell possibly,\nwhile they steered 'fore the wind with the preventer tiller.\"\n\n\"They've got somebody. Can you see? It's the woman! Blown overboard. See\nany one else? I don't.\"\n\nRiley did not answer, and soon Jenkins spoke again.\n\n\"They're coming back. Only the woman--only the woman out o' the whole\ncrowd.\"\n\n\"They'd better hurry up,\" responded Riley. \"What's that over to the\nnor'ard?\"\n\n\"Nothing but a tramp,\" said Jenkins, at length. \"But we don't want to be\ninterviewed. Bear a hand, you fellows,\" he shouted. \"Is the woman dead?\"\n\n\"No--guess not,\" came the answer, through the small deadlight. \"Fainted\naway since we picked her up. Burned or scalded, somewhat.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nDenman saw the boat for a moment or two as it came alongside, and\nnoticed the still form of the woman in the stern sheets, her face hidden\nby a black silk neckerchief. Then he could only know by the voices that\nthey were lifting her aboard and aft to the captain's quarters. But he\nwas somewhat surprised to see the door that led to these quarters opened\nby Jenkins, who beckoned him.\n\n\"We've picked up a poor woman, sir,\" he said, \"and put her in here. Now,\nwe're too busy on deck to 'tend to her, Mr. Denman, and then--we don't\nknow how; but--well, you're an educated man, and a gentleman. Would you\nmind? I've chased the bunch out, and I won't let 'em bother you. It's\njust an extension of your cruising radius.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Denman. \"I'll do what I can for her.\"\n\n\"All right, sir. I'll leave this door open, but I must lock the after\ncompanion.\"\n\nHe went on deck by the wardroom stairs, while Denman passed through to\nthe woman. She lay on a transom, dripping water from her clothing to the\ncarpet, and with the black cloth still over her face; but, on hearing\nhis footsteps, she removed it, showing a countenance puffed and crimson\nfrom the scalding of the live steam that had blown her overboard. Then,\ngroaning pitifully, she sat up, and looked at him through swollen\neyelids.\n\n\"What is it?\" she exclaimed, weakly. \"What has happened? Where is\nfather?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" said Denman, gently, \"you have been picked up from a steam\nyacht which exploded her boilers. Are you in pain? What can I do for\nyou?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Yes, I am in pain. My face.\"\n\n\"Wait, and I will get you what I can from the medicine-chest.\"\n\nDenman explored the surgeon's quarters, and returned with bandages and a\nmixture of linseed oil and lime water. He gently laved and bound the\npoor woman's face, and then led her to the captain's berth.\n\n\"Go in,\" he said. \"Take off your wet clothes, and put on his pajamas.\nHere they are\"--he produced them from a locker--\"and then turn in. I\nwill be here, and will take care of you.\"\n\nHe departed, and when he saw the wet garments flung out, he gathered\nthem and hung them up to dry. It was all he could do, except to look\nthrough the surgeon's quarters for stimulants, which he found. He\npoured out a strong dose of brandy, which he gave to the woman, and had\nthe satisfaction of seeing her sink into profound slumber; then,\nreturning to the wardroom, he found Jenkins waiting for him.\n\n\"I am after a sextant, Mr. Denman,\" he said, \"an almanac--a nautical\nalmanac. Forsythe wants them.\"\n\n\"You must find them yourself, then,\" answered Denman. \"Neither under\nparole nor confinement will I aid you in any way unless you surrender.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Jenkins, impatiently, as he stepped past Denman, and\napproached a bookcase. \"When we're through with the boat you can have\nher.\"\n\nHe had incautiously turned his back. Denman saw the protruding butt of\nhis pistol in Jenkins' pocket, and, without any formulated plan for the\nfuture, only seeing a momentary advantage in the possession of the\nweapon, pounced on his shoulders, and endeavored to secure it.\n\nBut he was not able to; he could only hold on, his arms around Jenkins'\nneck, while the big sailor hove his huge body from side to side, and,\ngripping his legs, endeavored to shake him off.\n\nNo word was spoken--only their deep breathing attested to their\nearnestness, and they thrashed around the wardroom like a dog and a cat,\nDenman, in the latter similitude, in the air most of the time. But he\nwas getting the worst of it, and at last essayed a trick he knew of,\ntaught him in Japan, and to be used as a last resort.\n\nGripping his legs tightly around the body of Jenkins, he sagged down and\npressed the tips of his forefingers into two vulnerable parts of the\nthick neck, where certain important nerves approach the surface--parts\nas vulnerable as the heel of Achilles. Still clinging, he mercilessly\ncontinued the pressure, while Jenkins swayed back and forth, and finally\nfell backward to the floor.\n\nDenman immediately secured the pistol; then, panting hard, he examined\nhis victim. Jenkins was breathing with the greatest difficulty, but\ncould not speak or move, and his big eyes glared piteously up at his\nconqueror. The latter would have ironed him at once, but the irons were\nforward in the armroom, so he temporarily bound him hand and foot with\nneckties replevined from his fellow officers' staterooms.\n\nThen, relieving Jenkins of his keys, he went through the forward door to\nthe armroom, from which he removed, not only wrist and leg arms, but\nevery cutlass and service revolver that the boat was stocked with, and a\nplentiful supply of ammunition.\n\nFirst properly securing the still inert and helpless Jenkins, he dragged\nhim to a corner, and then stowed the paraphernalia of war in his room,\nloading as many as a dozen of the heavy revolvers.\n\nHe was still without a plan, working under intense excitement, and could\nonly follow impulses, the next of which was to lock the wardroom\ncompanion down which Jenkins had come, and to see that the forward door\nand the after companion were secured. This done, he sat down abreast of\nhis prisoner to watch him, and think it out. There was no change in\nJenkins; he still breathed hard, and endeavored unsuccessfully to speak,\nwhile his eyes--the angry glare gone from them--looked up inquiringly.\n\n\"Oh, you're all right, Captain Jenkins,\" said Denman. \"You'll breathe\neasier to-morrow, and in a week, perhaps, you may speak in a whisper;\nbut you are practically deprived from command. So make the best of it.\"\n\nJenkins seemed willing to, but this did not solve the problem; there\nwere twelve other recalcitrants on deck who might not be so easily\njujutsued into weakness and dumbness.\n\nAs the situation cleared, he saw two ways of solving it, one, to remain\nbelow, and from the shelter of his room to pot them one by one as they\ncame down; the other, to take the initiative, assert himself on deck\nbehind the menace of cocked revolvers, and overawe them into submission.\n\nThe first plan involved hunger, for he could eat nothing not provided by\nthem; the other, a quick and certain ending of the false position he was\nin--a plan very appealing to his temperament.\n\nHe rose to his feet with a final inspection of Jenkins' bonds, and,\ngoing to his room, belted and armed himself with three heavy revolvers,\nthen opened the wardroom companion door, and stepped to the deck. No one\nwas in sight, except the man at the wheel, not now steering in the\nclose, armored conning tower, but at the upper wheel on the bridge.\n\nHe looked aft, and, spying Denman, gave a shout of warning.\n\nBut no one responded, and Denman, with a clear field, advanced forward,\nlooking to the right and left, until he reached the engine-room hatch,\ndown which he peered. Riley's anxious face looked up at him, and farther\ndown was the cringing form of King, his mate of the starboard watch.\nDenman did not know their names, but he sternly commanded them to come\nup.\n\n\"We can't leave the engines, sir,\" said Riley, shrinking under the cold\nargument of two cold, blue tubes pointed at them.\n\n\"Shut off your gas, and never mind your engines,\" commanded Denman.\n\"Come up on deck quietly, or I'll put holes in you.\"\n\nKing shut off the gas, Riley turned a valve that eased off the making\nsteam, and the two appeared before Denman.\n\n\"Lie down on deck, the two of you,\" said Denman, sharply. \"Take off your\nneckerchiefs, and give them to me.\"\n\nThey obeyed him. He took the two squares of black silk--similar to that\nwhich had covered the face of the rescued woman, and with them he bound\ntheir hands tightly behind their backs.\n\n\"Lie still, now,\" he said, \"until I settle matters.\"\n\nThey could rise and move, but could not thwart him immediately. He went\nforward, and mounted to the bridge.\n\n\"How are you heading?\" he demanded, with a pistol pointed toward the\nhelmsman.\n\n\"South--due south, sir,\" answered the man--it was Davis, of the\nstarboard watch.\n\n\"Leave the wheel. The engine is stopped. Down on deck with you, and take\noff your neckerchief.\"\n\nDavis descended meekly, gave him his neckerchief, and was bound as were\nthe others. Then Denman looked for the rest.\n\nSo far--good. He had three prisoners on deck and one in the wardroom;\nthe rest were below, on duty or asleep. They were in the forecastle--the\ncrew's quarters--in the wireless room below the bridge, in the galley\njust forward of the wardroom. Denman had his choice, and decided on the\nforecastle as the place containing the greatest number. Down the\nfore-hatch he went, and entered the apartment. A man rolled out of a\nbunk, and faced him.\n\n\"Up with your hands,\" said Denman, softly. \"Up, quickly.\"\n\nThe man's hands went up. \"All right, sir,\" he answered, sleepily and\nsomewhat weakly. \"My name's Hawkes, and I haven't yet disobeyed an order\nfrom an officer.\"\n\n\"Don't,\" warned Denman, sharply. \"Take off your neckerchief.\"\n\nOff came the black silk square.\n\n\"Wake up the man nearest you. Tie his hands behind his back, and take\noff his necktie.\"\n\nIt was a machinist named Sampson who was wakened and bound, with the\ncold, blue tube of Denman's pistol looking at him; and then it was\nDwyer, his watch mate, and Munson, the wireless man off duty, ending\nwith old Kelly, the gunner's mate--each tied with the neckerchief of the\nlast man wakened, and Hawkes, the first to surrender, with the\nneckerchief of Kelly.\n\n\"On deck with you all,\" commanded Denman, and he drove them up the steps\nto the deck, where they lay down beside Riley, King, and Davis. None\nspoke or protested. Each felt the inhibition of the presence of a\ncommissioned officer, and Denman might have won--might have secured the\nrest and brought them under control--had not a bullet sped from the\nafter companion, which, besides knocking his cap from his head,\ninflicted a glancing wound on his scalp and sent him headlong to the\ndeck.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nAfter the rescue of the woman, all but those on duty had mustered\nforward near the bridge, Jenkins with a pair of binoculars to his eyes\ninspecting a receding steamer on the horizon, the others passing\ncomments. All had agreed that she was a merchant craft--the first they\nhad met at close quarters--but not all were agreed that she carried no\nwireless equipment. Jenkins, even with the glasses, could not be sure,\nbut he _was_ sure of one thing, he asserted. Even though the steamer\nhad recognized and reported their position, it made little difference.\n\n\"Well,\" said Forsythe, \"if she can report us, why can't we? Why can't we\nfake a report--send out a message that we've been seen a thousand miles\nnorth?\"\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" said Casey, the wireless man off duty. \"We needn't\ngive any name--only a jumble of letters that spell nothing.\"\n\n\"How far can you send with what you've got?\" asked Jenkins.\n\n\"With those a\u00c3\u00abrials,\" answered Casey, glancing aloft at the long\ngridiron of wires, \"about fifty miles.\"\n\n\"Not much good, I'm afraid,\" said Jenkins. \"Lord knows where we are, but\nwe're more than fifty miles from land.\"\n\n\"That as far as you can reason?\" broke in Forsythe. \"Jenkins, you're\nhandy at a knockdown, but if you can't use what brain you've got, you'd\nbetter resign command here. I don't know who elected you, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Are you looking for more, Forsythe?\" asked Jenkins, taking a step\ntoward him. \"If you are, you can have it. If not, get down to your\nstudies, and find out where this craft is, so we can get somewhere.\"\n\nForsythe, hiding his emotions under a forced grin, retreated toward the\nfore-hatch.\n\n\"I can give you the latitude,\" he said, before descending, \"by a\nmeridian observation this noon. I picked up the method in one lesson\nthis morning. But I tell you fellows, I'm tired of getting knocked\ndown.\"\n\nJenkins watched him descend, then said to Casey: \"Fake up a message\nclaiming to be from some ship with a jumbled name, as you say, and be\nready to send it if he gets our position.\"\n\n\"Then you think well of it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Forsythe has brains. The only trouble with him is that he\nwants to run things too much.\"\n\nCasey, a smooth-faced, keen-eyed Irish-American, descended to consult\nwith his _confr\u00c3\u00a8re_, Munson; and Forsythe appeared, swinging a book.\nLaying this on the bridge stairs, he passed Jenkins and walked aft.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked the latter.\n\nForsythe turned, white with rage, and answered slowly and softly:\n\n\"Down to the officers' quarters to get a sextant or a quadrant. I found\nthat book on navigation in the pilot-house, but I need the instrument,\nand a nautical almanac. That is as far as my studies have progressed.\"\n\n\"You stay out of the officers' quarters,\" said Jenkins. \"There's a man\nthere who'll eat you alive if you show yourself. You want a sextant and\nnautical almanac. Anything else?\"\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\n\"I'll get them, and, remember, you and the rest are to stay away from\nthe after end of the boat.\"\n\nForsythe made no answer as Jenkins passed him on the way aft, but\nmuttered: \"Eat me alive? We'll see.\"\n\nRiley, one of the machinists, appeared from the engine-room hatch and\ncame forward, halting before Forsythe.\n\n\"Say,\" he grumbled, \"what call has that big lobster to bullyrag this\ncrowd the way he's been doin'? I heard him just now givin' you hell, and\nhe gave me hell yesterday when I spoke of the short oil.\"\n\n\"Short oil?\" queried Forsythe. \"Do you mean that----\"\n\n\"I mean that the oil won't last but a day longer. We've been storming\nalong at forty knots, and eating up oil. What'll we do?\"\n\n\"God knows,\" answered Forsythe, reflectively. \"Without oil, we stop--in\nmid-ocean. What then?\"\n\n\"What then?\" queried Riley. \"Well, before then we must hold up some\ncraft and get the oil--also grub and water, if I guess right. This bunch\nis hard on the commissary.\"\n\n\"Riley,\" said Forsythe, impressively, \"will you stand by me?\"\n\n\"Yes; if you can bring that big chump to terms.\"\n\n\"All right. Talk to your partners. Something must be done--and he can't\ndo it. Wait a little.\"\n\nAs though to verify Riley and uphold him in his contention, Daniels, the\ncook, came forward from the galley, and said: \"Just about one week's\nwhack o' grub and water left. We'll have to go on an allowance.\" Then he\npassed on, but was called back.\n\n\"One week's grub left?\" asked Forsythe. \"Sure o' that, Daniels?\"\n\n\"Surest thing you know. Plenty o' beans and hard-tack; but who wants\nbeans and hard-tack?\"\n\n\"Have you spoken to Jenkins about it?\"\n\n\"No, but we meant to. Something's got to be done. Where is he now?\"\n\n\"Down aft,\" said Forsythe, reflectively. \"What's keeping him?\"\n\nRiley sank into the engine room, and Daniels went forward to the\nforecastle, reappearing before Forsythe had reached a conclusion.\n\n\"Come aft with me, Daniels,\" he said. \"Let's find out what's doing.\"\n\nTogether they crept aft, and peered down the wardroom skylight. They saw\nDenman and Jenkins locked in furious embrace, and watched while Jenkins\nsank down, helpless and impotent. They saw Denman bind him, disappear\nfrom sight, and reappear with the irons, then they listened to his\nparting lecture to Jenkins.\n\n\"Come,\" said Forsythe, \"down below with us, quick.\"\n\nThey descended the galley companion, from which a passage led aft to the\npetty officers' quarters, which included the armroom, and thence to the\nforward door of the wardroom. Here they halted, and listened to Denman's\nmovements while he armed himself and climbed the companion stairs. They\ncould also see through the keyhole.\n\n\"He's heeled!\" cried Forsythe. \"Where did he get the guns?\"\n\n\"Where's the armroom? Hereabouts somewhere. Where is it?\"\n\nThey hurriedly searched, and found the armroom; it contained cumbersome\nrifles, cutlasses, and war heads, but no pistols.\n\n\"He's removed them all. Can we break in that door?\" asked Forsythe,\nrushing toward the bulkhead.\n\n\"No, hold on,\" said Daniels. \"We'll watch from the companion, and when\nhe's forward we'll sneak down the other, and heel ourselves.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nSo, while Denman crept up and walked forward, glancing right and left,\nthe two watched him from the galley hatch, and, after he had bound the\ntwo engineers and the helmsman, they slipped aft and descended the\nwardroom stairs. Here they looked at Jenkins, vainly trying to speak,\nbut ignored him for the present.\n\nThey hurried through the quarters, and finally found Denman's room with\nits arsenal of loaded revolvers. They belted and armed themselves, and\ncarefully climbed the steps just in time to see Denman drive the\nforecastle contingent to the deck. Then Forsythe, taking careful aim,\nsent the bullet which knocked Denman unconscious to the deck.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nForsythe and Daniels ran forward, while Billings, the cook off watch,\nfollowed from the galley hatch, and Casey came up from the wireless\nroom. Each asked questions, but nobody answered at once. There were\neight bound men lying upon the deck, and these must first be released,\nwhich was soon done.\n\nDenman, lying prone with a small pool of blood near his head, was next\nexamined, and pronounced alive--he was breathing, but dazed and shocked;\nfor a large-caliber bullet glancing upon the skull has somewhat the same\neffect as the blow of a cudgel. He opened his eyes as the men examined\nthem, and dimly heard what they said.\n\n\"Now,\" said Forsythe, when these preliminaries were concluded, \"here we\nare, miles at sea, with short store of oil, according to Riley, and a\nshort store of grub, according to Daniels. What's to be done? Hey? The\nman who has bossed us so far hasn't seen this, and is now down in the\nwardroom--knocked out by this brass-buttoned dudeling. What are you\ngoing to do, hey?\"\n\nForsythe flourished his pistols dramatically, and glared unspeakable\nthings at the \"dudeling\" on the deck.\n\n\"Well, Forsythe,\" said old Kelly, the gunner's mate, \"you've pretended\nto be a navigator. What do you say?\"\n\n\"I say this,\" declared Forsythe: \"I'm not a navigator, but I can be. But\nI want it understood. There has got to be a leader--a commander. If you\nfellows agree, I'll master the navigation and take this boat to the\nAfrican coast. But I want no half-way work; I want my orders to go, just\nas I give them. Do you agree? You've gone wrong under Jenkins. Take your\nchoice.\"\n\n\"You're right, Forsythe,\" said Casey, the wireless man of the starboard\nwatch. \"Jenkins is too easy--too careless. Take the job, I say.\"\n\n\"Do you all agree?\" yelled Forsythe wildly in his excitement.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" they acclaimed. \"Take charge, and get us out o' these seas.\nWho wants to be locked up?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Forsythe. \"Then I'm the commander. Lift that baby down\nto the skipper's room with the sick woman, and let them nurse each\nother. Lift Jenkins out of the wardroom, and stow him in a forecastle\nbunk. Riley, nurse your engines and save oil, but keep the dynamo going\nfor the wireless; and you, Casey, have you got that message cooked up?\"\n\n\"I have. All I want is the latitude and longitude to send it from.\"\n\n\"I'll give it to you soon. Get busy, now, and do your share. I must\nstudy a little.\"\n\nThe meeting adjourned. Denman, still dazed and with a splitting\nheadache, was assisted aft and below to the spare berth in the captain's\nquarters, where he sank into unconsciousness with the moaning of the\nstricken woman in his ears.\n\nCasey went down to his partner and his instruments; Riley and King, with\ntheir _confr\u00c3\u00a8res_ of the other watch, went down to the engines to \"nurse\nthem\"; and Forsythe, after Jenkins had been lifted out of the wardroom\nand forward to a forecastle bunk, searched the bookshelves and the desks\nof the officers, and, finding what he wanted, went forward to study.\n\nHe was apt; he was a high-school graduate who only needed to apply\nhimself to produce results. And Forsythe produced them. As he had\npromised, he took a meridian observation that day, and in half an hour\nannounced the latitude--thirty-five degrees forty minutes north.\n\n\"Now, Casey,\" he called, after he had looked at a track chart. \"Got your\nfake message ready?\"\n\n\"Only this,\" answered Casey, scanning a piece of paper. \"Listen:\n\n    \"Stolen destroyer bound north. Latitude so and so, longitude so and\n    so.\"\n\n\"That'll do, or anything like it. Send it from latitude forty north,\nfifty-five west. That's up close to the corner of the Lanes, and if it's\ncaught up it'll keep 'em busy up there for a while.\"\n\n\"What's our longitude?\"\n\n\"Don't know, and won't until I learn the method. But just north of us is\nthe west-to-east track of outbound low-power steamers, which, I take it,\nmeans tramps and tankers. Well, we'll have good use for a tanker.\"\n\n\"You mean we're to hold up one for oil?\"\n\n\"Of course, and for grub if we need it.\"\n\n\"Piracy, Forsythe.\"\n\n\"Have pirates got anything on us, now?\" asked Forsythe. \"What are we?\nMutineers, convicts, strong-arm men, thieves--or just simply pirates.\nOff the deck with you, Casey, and keep your wires hot. Forty north,\nforty-five west for a while, then we'll have it farther north.\"\n\nCasey jotted down the figures, and departed to the wireless room, where,\nat intervals through the day he sent out into the ether the radiating\nwaves, which, if picked up within fifty miles by a craft beyond the\nhorizon, might be relayed on.\n\nThe success of the scheme could not be learned by any tangible signs,\nbut for the next few days, while the boat lay with quiet engines and\nForsythe studied navigation, they remarked that they were not pursued or\nnoticed by passing craft.\n\nAnd as the boat, with dead engines, rolled lazily in the long Atlantic\nswell, while the men--all but Forsythe, the two cooks, and the two\nwireless experts--lolled lazily about the deck, the three invalids of\nthe ship's company were convalescing in different degrees.\n\nJenkins, dumb and wheezy, lay prone in a forecastle bunk, trying to\nwonder how it happened. His mental faculties, though apprising him that\nhe was alive, would hardly carry him to the point of wonder; for wonder\npredicates imagination, and what little Jenkins was born with had been\nshocked out of him.\n\nStill he struggled, and puzzled and guessed, weakly, as to what had\nhappened to him, and when a committee from the loungers above visited\nhim, and asked what struck him, he could only point suggestively to his\nthroat, and wag his head. He could not even whisper; and so they left\nhim, pondering upon the profanely expressed opinion of old Kelly that it\nwas a \"visitation from God.\"\n\nThe committee went aft to the skipper's quarters, and here loud talk and\nprofanity ceased; for there was a woman below, and, while these fellows\nwere not gentlemen--as the term is understood--they were men--bad men,\nbut men.\n\nOn the way down the stairs, Kelly struck, bare-handed, his watch mate\nHawkes for expressing an interest in the good looks of the woman; and\nSampson, a giant, like his namesake, smote old Kelly, hip and thigh, for\nqualifying his strictures on the comment of Hawkes.\n\nThus corrected and enjoined, with caps in hand, they approached the open\ndoor of the starboard room, where lay the injured woman in a berth,\nfully clothed in her now dried garments, and her face still hidden in\nDenman's bandage.\n\n\"Excuse me, madam,\" said Sampson, the present chairman of the committee,\n\"can we do anything for you?\"\n\n\"I cannot see you,\" she answered, faintly. \"I do not know where I am,\nnor what will happen to me. But I am in need of attention. One man was\nkind to me, but he has not returned. Who are you--you men?\"\n\n\"We're the crew of the boat,\" answered Sampson, awkwardly. \"The\nskipper's forward, and I guess the man that was kind to you is our\nprisoner. He's not on the job now, but--what can we do?\"\n\n\"Tell me where I am, and where I am going. What boat is this? Who are\nyou?\"\n\n\"Well, madam,\" broke in old Kelly, \"we're a crowd o' jail-breakers that\nstole a torpedo-boat destroyer, and put to sea. We got you off a burned\nand sinking yacht, and you're here with us; but I'm blessed if I know\nwhat we'll do with you. Our necks are in the halter, so to speak--or\nrather, our hands and ankles are in irons for life, if we're caught.\nYou've got to make the best of it until we get caught, and if we don't,\nyou've got to make the best of it, too. Lots o' young men among us, and\nyou're no spring chicken, by the looks o' you.\"\n\nOld Kelly went down before a fist blow from Hawkes, who thus strove to\nrehabilitate himself in the good opinion of his mates, and Hawkes went\nbackward from a blow from Sampson, who, as yet unsullied from unworthy\nthought, held his position as peacemaker and moralist. And while they\nwere recovering from the excitement, Denman, with blood on his face\nfrom the wound in his scalp, appeared among them.\n\n\"Are you fellows utterly devoid of manhood and self-respect,\" he said,\nsternly, \"that you appear before the door of a sickroom and bait a woman\nwho cannot defend herself even by speech? Shame upon you! You have\ncrippled me, but I am recovering. If you cannot aid this woman, leave\nher to me. She is burned, scalded, disfigured--she hardly knows her\nname, or where she came from. You have saved her from the wreck, and\nhave since neglected her. Men, you are jailbirds as you say, but you are\nAmerican seamen. If you cannot help her, leave her. Do not insult her. I\nam helpless; if I had power I would decree further relief from the\nmedicine-chest. But I am a prisoner--restricted.\"\n\nSampson squared his big shoulders. \"On deck with you fellows--all of\nyou. Git--quick!\"\n\nThey filed up the companion, leaving Sampson looking at Denman.\n\n\"Lieutenant,\" he said, \"you take care o' this poor woman, and if any one\ninterferes, notify me. I'm as big a man as Jenkins, who's knocked out,\nand a bigger man than Forsythe, who's now in command. But we're\nfair--understand? We're fair--the most of us.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered Denman, as he staggered back to a transom seat.\n\n\"Want anything yourself?\" asked Sampson, as he noted the supine figure\nof Denman. \"You're still Lieutenant Denman, of the navy--understand?\"\n\n\"No, I do not. Leave me alone.\"\n\nSampson followed his mates.\n\nDenman sat a few moments, nursing his aching head and trying to adjust\nhimself to conditions. And as he sat there, he felt a hand on his\nshoulder and heard a weak voice saying:\n\n\"Are you Lieutenant Denman--Billie Denman?\"\n\nHe looked up. The bandaged face of the woman was above him. Out of the\nfolds of the bandage looked two serious, gray eyes; and he knew them.\n\n\"Florrie!\" he said, in a choke. \"Is this you--grown up? Florrie Fleming!\nHow--why--what brings you here?\"\n\n\"I started on the trip, Billie,\" she said, calmly, \"with father on a\nfriend's yacht bound for the Bermudas. We caught fire, and I was the\nonly one saved, it seems; but how are you here, subordinate to these\nmen? And you are injured, Billie--you are bleeding! What has happened?\"\n\n\"The finger of Fate, Florrie, or the act of God,\" answered Denman, with\na painful smile. \"We must have the conceit taken out of us on occasions,\nyou know. Forsythe, my schoolmate, is in command of this crowd of\njail-breakers and pirates.\"\n\n\"Forsythe--your conqueror?\" She receded a step. \"I had-- Do you know,\nMr. Denman, that you were my hero when I was a child, and that I never\nforgave Jack Forsythe? I had hoped to hear--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" he interrupted, hotly, while his head throbbed anew with\nthe surge of emotion. \"I know what you and the whole town expected.\nBut--well, I knocked him down on deck a short time back, and the\nknockdown stands; but they would not allow a finish. Then he shot me\nwhen I was not looking.\"\n\n\"I am glad,\" she answered, simply, \"for your sake, and perhaps for my\nown, for I, too, it seems, am in his power.\"\n\nHe answered her as he could, incoherently and meaninglessly, but she\nwent to her room and closed the door.\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nDown the wardroom companion came Forsythe, followed by Sampson, who\nedged alongside of him as he peered into the after compartment, where\nDenman sat on the transom.\n\n\"What do you want down here with me?\" asked Forsythe, in a snarl, as he\nlooked sidewise at Sampson.\n\n\"To see that you act like a man,\" answered the big machinist. \"There's a\nsick woman here.\"\n\n\"And a more or less sick man,\" answered Forsythe, \"that if I hadn't made\nsick would ha' had you in irons. Get up on deck. All I want is a\nchronometer.\"\n\n\"Under the circumstances,\" rejoined Sampson, coolly, \"though I\nacknowledge your authority as far as governing this crew is concerned,\nwhen it comes to a sick woman defended only by a wounded officer, I\nshift to the jurisdiction of the officer. If Lieutenant Denman asks that\nI go on deck, I will go. Otherwise, I remain.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Denman, weakly, for he had lost much blood. \"Perhaps\nForsythe need not be antagonized or coerced. Forsythe, do you remember a\nlittle girl at home named Florrie Fleming? Well, that woman is she. I\nappeal to whatever is left of your boyhood ideals to protect this woman,\nand care for her.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember her,\" answered Forsythe, with a bitter smile. \"She\nthought you were a little tin god on wheels, and told me after you'd\ngone that you'd come back and thrash me. You didn't, did you?\" His\nspeech ended in a sneer.\n\n\"No, but I will when the time comes,\" answered Denman; but the mental\ntransition from pity to anger overcame him, and he sank back.\n\n\"Now, this is neither here nor there, Forsythe,\" said Sampson, sternly.\n\"You want a chronometer. When you get it, you've no more business here\nthan I have, and I think you'd better use your authority like a man, or\nI'll call a meeting of the boys.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" answered Forsythe, looking at the big shoulders of Sampson.\n\"But, inasmuch as I knew this fellow from boyhood, and knew this little\ngirl when a child, the best care I can give her is to remove this chap\nfrom her vicinity. We'll put him down the fore peak, and let one o' the\ncooks feed her and nurse her.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that on deck,\" said Sampson, indignantly. \"I'll talk--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" broke in Denman, standing up. \"Forsythe is right. It is not\nfitting that I should be here alone with her. Put me anywhere you like,\nbut take care of her, as you are men and Americans.\"\n\nForsythe made no answer, but Sampson gave Denman a troubled, doubtful\nlook, then nodded, and followed Forsythe to the various rooms until he\nhad secured what he wanted; then they went on deck together.\n\nBut in an hour they were back; and, though Denman had heard nothing of a\nconclave on deck, he judged by their faces that there had been one, and\nthat Forsythe had been overruled by the influence of Sampson. For\nSampson smiled and Forsythe scowled, as they led Denman into the\nwardroom to his own berth, and locked him in with the assurance that the\ncooks would feed him and attend to the wants of himself and the woman.\n\nBillings soon came with arnica, plaster, and bandages, and roughly\ndressed his wound; but he gave him no information of their plans.\nHowever, Denman could still look out through a deadlight.\n\nA few hours after the boat's engines had started, he could see a\nsteamer on the horizon, steering a course that would soon intercept that\nof the destroyer.\n\nShe was a one-funneled, two-masted craft, a tramp, possibly, a working\nboat surely; but he only learned when her striped funnel came to view\nthat she belonged to a regular line. She made no effort to avoid them,\nbut held on until within hailing distance, when he heard Forsythe's\nvoice from the bridge.\n\n\"Steamer ahoy!\" he shouted. \"What's your cargo?\"\n\n\"Oil,\" answered a man on the steamer's bridge. \"What are you holding me\nup for?\"\n\n\"Oil,\" answered Forsythe. \"How is it stowed--in cases, or in bulk?\"\n\n\"In bulk, you doggoned fool.\"\n\n\"Very good. We want some of that oil.\"\n\n\"You do, hey? Who are you? You look like that runaway destroyer I've\nheard so much about. Who's going to recompense the company for the oil\nyou want? Hey? Where do I come in? Who pays the bill?\"\n\n\"Send it to the United States Government, or send it to the devil. Pass\na hose over the side, and dip your end into the tank.\"\n\n\"Suppose I say no?\"\n\n\"Then we'll send a few shells into your water line.\"\n\n\"Is that straight? Are you pirates that would sink a working craft?\"\n\n\"As far as you are concerned we are. Pass over your hose, and stop\ntalking about it. All we want is a little oil.\"\n\n\"Will you give me a written receipt?\"\n\n\"Of course. Name your bill. We'll toss it up on a drift bolt. Pass over\nthe hose.\"\n\n\"All right. Hook on your own reducer and suck it full with your pump;\nthen it will siphon down.\"\n\n\"Got reducers, Sampson?\"\n\n\"Got several. Guess we can start the flow.\"\n\nThe two craft drew close together, a hose was flung from the tanker to\nthe destroyer, and the four machinists worked for a while with wrenches\nand pump fittings until the connection was made; then they started the\npump, filled the hose, and, disconnecting, dropped their end into the\ntanks.\n\nThe oil, by the force of gravity, flowed from one craft to the other\nuntil the gauges showed a full supply. Then a written receipt for one\nhundred and twenty-five tons of oil was signed by the leaders, tied to a\npiece of iron, and tossed aboard the tanker, and the two craft\nseparated, the pirate heading south, as Denman could see by the\ntelltale.\n\nDenman, his wounded scalp easier, lay down in his berth and smoked while\nhe thought out his plans. Obviously the men were pirates, fully\ncommitted; they would probably repeat the performance; and as obviously\nthey would surely be caught in time. There was nothing that he could do,\nexcept to heal his wound and wait.\n\nHe could not even assist Miss Florrie, no matter what peril might menace\nher; then, as he remembered a bunch of duplicate keys given him when he\njoined as executive officer, he thought that perhaps he might. They were\nin his desk, and, rolling out, he secured them.\n\nHe tried them in turn on his door lock, and finally found the one that\nfitted. This he took off the ring and secured with his own bunch of\nkeys, placing the others--which he easily surmised belonged to all the\nlocking doors in the boat--in another pocket. Then he lay back to finish\nhis smoke. But Sampson opened his door, and interrupted.\n\n\"You'll excuse me, sir,\" he began, while Denman peered critically at him\nthrough the smoke. \"But I suppose you know what we've just done?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"I could see a little and hear more. You've held up\nand robbed an oil steamer.\"\n\n\"And is it piracy, sir, in the old sense--a hanging matter if we're\ncaught?\"\n\n\"Hardly know,\" said Denman, after a moment's reflection. \"Laws are\nrepealed every now and then. Did you kill any one?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, I judge that a pirate at sea is about on the same plane as a\nburglar on shore. If he kills any one while committing a felony, he is\nguilty of murder in the first degree. Better not kill any fellow men,\nthen you'll only get a long term--perhaps for life--when you're nabbed.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Denman. They're talking big things on deck,\nbut--there'll be no killing. Forsythe is something of a devil and will\nstop at nothing, but I'll--\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said Denman, lazily, \"he'll stop at me if you release me.\"\n\n\"Not yet, sir. It may be necessary, but at present we're thinking of\nourselves.\"\n\n\"All right. But, tell me, how did you get a key to my door? How many\nkeys are there?\"\n\n\"Oh, from Billings, sir. Not with Forsythe's knowledge, however.\nBillings, and some others, think no more of him than I do.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" responded Denman. \"I knew him at school. Look out for\nhim. By the way, is the lady aft being attended to?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Daniels, the other cook, brings her what she needs. She is\nnot locked up, though.\"\n\n\"That's good. Give her the run of the deck, and take care of her.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, we will,\" answered Sampson, as respectfully as though it were\na legitimate order--for force of habit is strong. Then he left the room,\nlocking the door behind him.\n\nDenman smoked until he had finished the cigar, and, after he had eaten a\nsupper brought by Billings, he smoked again until darkness closed down.\nAnd with the closing down of darkness came a plan.\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTossing his cigar through the opened deadlight, Denman arose and\nunlocked his door, passing into the small and empty wardroom. First, he\ntried the forward door leading into the petty officers' quarters and to\nthe armroom, and, finding it locked, sought for the key which opened it,\nand passed through, closing the door softly behind him.\n\nFarther forward he could hear the voice of Billings, singing cheerfully\nto himself in the galley; and, filtering through the galley hatch and\nopen deadlights, the voice of Forsythe, uttering angry commands to some\none on deck.\n\nHe had no personal design upon Billings, nor at present upon Forsythe,\nso he searched the armroom. As Forsythe and Daniels had found, there was\nnothing there more formidable than cutlasses, rifles, and torpedo heads;\nthe pistols had been removed to some other place. So Denman went back\nand searched the wardroom, delving into closets and receptacles looking\nfor arms; but he found none, and sat down on a chair to think. Presently\nhe arose and tapped on the glazed glass door of the captain's\napartment.\n\n\"Florrie,\" he said, in a half whisper. \"Florrie, are you awake?\"\n\nThere was no answer for a moment; then he saw a shadow move across the\ndoor.\n\n\"Florrie,\" he repeated, \"are you awake?\"\n\n\"Who is this?\" came an answering whisper through the door.\n\n\"Denman--Billie Denman,\" he answered. \"If you are awake and clothed, let\nme in. I have a key, and I want to talk with you.\"\n\n\"All right--yes. Come in. But--I have no key, and the door is locked.\"\n\nDenman quickly found the key and opened the door. She stood there, with\nher face still tied up in cloths, and only her gray eyes showing in the\nlight from the electric bulbs of the room.\n\n\"Florrie,\" he said, \"will you do your part toward helping us out of our\npresent trouble?\"\n\n\"I'll do what I can, Billie; but I cannot do much.\"\n\n\"You can do a lot,\" he responded. \"Just get up on deck, with your face\ntied up, and walk around. Speak to any man you meet, and go forward to\nthe bridge. Ask any one you see, any question you like, as to where we\nare going, or what is to be done with us--anything at all which will\njustify your presence on deck. Just let them see that you are on deck,\nand will be on deck again. Will you, Florrie?\"\n\n\"My face is still very bad, Billie; and the wind cuts like a knife. Why\nmust I go up among those men?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you afterward. Go along, Florrie. Just show yourself, and\ncome down.\"\n\n\"I am in the dark. Why do you not tell me what is ahead? I would rather\nstay here and go to bed.\"\n\n\"You can go to bed in ten minutes,\" said Denman. \"But go up first and\nshow yourself, and come down. I will do the rest.\"\n\n\"Well, Billie, I will. I do not like to, but you seem to have some plan\nwhich you do not tell me of, so--well, all right. I will go up.\"\n\nShe put on a cloak and ascended the companion stairs, and Denman sat\ndown to wait. He heard nothing, not even a voice of congratulation, and\nafter a few moments Florrie came down.\n\n\"I met them all,\" she said, \"and they were civil and polite. What more\ndo you want of me, Billie?\"\n\n\"Your cloak, your hat, and your skirt. I will furnish the bandage.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Exactly. I will go up, dressed like you, and catch them unawares, one\nby one.\"\n\n\"But, Billie, they will kill you, or--hurt you. Don't do it, Billie.\"\n\n\"Now, here, Florrie girl,\" he answered firmly. \"I'll go into the\nwardroom, and you toss in the materials for my disguise. Then you go to\nbed. If I get into trouble they will return the clothes.\"\n\n\"But suppose they kill you! I will be at their mercy. Billie, I am alone\nhere without you.\"\n\n\"Florrie, they are sailors; that means that they are men. If I win, you\nare all right, of course. Now let me have the things. I want to get\ncommand of this boat.\"\n\n\"Take them, Billie; but return to me and tell me. Don't leave me in\nsuspense.\"\n\n\"I won't. I'll report, Florrie. Just wait and be patient.\"\n\nHe passed into the wardroom, and soon the skirt, hat, and cloak were\nthrown to him. He had some trouble in donning the garments; for, while\nthe length of the skirt did not matter, the width certainly did, and he\nmust needs piece out the waistband with a length of string, ruthlessly\npunching holes to receive it. The cloak was a tight squeeze for his\nbroader shoulders, but he managed it; and, after he had thoroughly\nmasked his face with bandages, he tried the hat. There were hatpins\nsticking to it, which he knew the utility of; but, as she had furnished\nhim nothing of her thick crown of hair, he jabbed these through the\nbandage, and surveyed himself in the skipper's large mirror.\n\n\"Most ladylike,\" he muttered, squinting through the bandages. Then he\nwent on deck.\n\nHis plan had progressed no further than this--to be able to reach the\ndeck unrecognized, so that he could watch, listen to the talk, and\ndecide what he might do later on.\n\nBillings still sang cheeringly in the galley, and the voices forward\nwere more articulate; chiefly concerned, it seemed, with the\nreplenishing of the water and food supply, and the necessity of\nForsythe's pursuing his studies so that they could know where they were.\nThe talk ended by their driving their commander below; and, when the\nwatches were set, Denman himself went down. He descended as he had come\nup, by the captain's companion, reported his safety to Florrie through\nthe partly opened stateroom door, and also requested that, each night as\nshe retired, she should toss the hat, cloak, and skirt into the\nwardroom. To this she agreed, and he discarded the uncomfortable rig and\nwent to his room, locking the captain's door behind him, also his own.\n\nHis plan had not progressed. He had only found a way to see things from\nthe deck instead of through a deadlight; and he went to sleep with the\ntroubled thought that, even though he should master them all, as he had\nonce nearly succeeded in doing, he would need to release them in order\nthat they should \"work ship.\" To put them on parole was out of the\nquestion.\n\nThe sudden stopping of the turbines woke him in the morning, and the\nsun shining into his deadlight apprised him that he had slept late. He\nlooked out and ahead, and saw a large, white steam yacht resting quietly\non the rolling ground swell, apparently waiting for the destroyer to\ncreep up to her.\n\n\"Another holdup,\" he said; \"and for grub and water this time, I\nsuppose.\"\n\nWishing to see this from the deck, he rushed aft to the captain's room\nand tapped on the door, meanwhile fumbling for his keys. There was no\nanswer, and, tapping again, he opened the door and entered.\n\n\"Florrie,\" he called, in a whisper, \"are you awake?\"\n\nShe did not reply, but he heard Sampson's voice from the deck.\n\n\"This is your chance, miss,\" he said. \"We're going to get stores from\nthat yacht; but no doubt she'll take you on board.\"\n\n\"Is she bound to New York, or some port where I may reach friends?\"\nasked the girl.\n\n\"No; bound to the Mediterranean.\"\n\n\"Will you release Mr. Denman as well?\"\n\n\"No. I'm pretty sure the boys will not. He knows our plans, and is a\nnaval officer, you see, with a strong interest in landing us. Once on\nshore, he would have every warship in the world after us.\"\n\n\"Then I stay here with Mr. Denman. He is wounded, and is my friend.\"\n\nDenman was on the point of calling up--to insist that she leave the\nyacht; but he thought, in time, that it would reveal his position, and\nleave him more helpless, while, perhaps, she might still refuse to go.\nHe heard Sampson's footsteps going forward, and called to her softly;\nbut she, too, had moved forward, and he went back to his deadlight.\n\nIt was a repetition of the scene with the oil steamer. Forsythe, loudly\nand profanely announcing their wants, and calling the yacht's attention\nto two twelve-pounders aimed at her water line. She was of the standard\ntype, clipper-bowed, square-sterned, with one funnel and two masts; and\nfrom the trucks of these masts stretched the three-wire grid of a\nwireless outfit.\n\nForward was a crowd of blue-clad sailors, on the bridge an officer and a\nhelmsman, and aft, on the fantail, a number of guests; while amidships,\nconversing earnestly, were two men, whose dress indicated that they were\nthe owner and sailing master.\n\nIn the door of a small deck house near them stood another man in\nuniform, and to this man the owner turned and spoke a few words. The man\ndisappeared inside, and Denman, straining his ears, heard the rasping\nsound of a wireless \"sender,\" and simultaneously Casey's warning shout\nto Forsythe:\n\n\"He's calling for help, Forsythe. Stop him.\"\n\nThen came Forsythe's vibrant voice.\n\n\"Call that man out of the wireless room,\" he yelled, \"or we'll send a\nshell into it. Train that gun, Kelly, and stand by for the word. Call\nhim out,\" he continued. \"Stop that message.\"\n\nThe rasping sound ceased, and the operator appeared; then, with their\neyes distended, the three ran forward.\n\n\"Any one else in that deck house?\" called Forsythe.\n\n\"No,\" answered the sailing master. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Kelly,\" said Forsythe, \"aim low, and send a shell into the house. Aim\nlow, so as to smash the instruments.\"\n\nKelly's reply was inarticulate, but in a moment the gun barked, and the\ndeck house disintegrated into a tangle of kindling from which oozed a\ncloud of smoke. Women screamed, and, forward and aft, the yacht's\npeople crowded toward the ends of the craft.\n\n\"What in thunder are you trying to do?\" roared the sailing master,\nshaking his fist. \"Are you going to sink us?\"\n\n\"Not unless necessary,\" replied Forsythe; \"but we want grub--good grub,\ntoo--and water. We want water through your own hose, because ours is\nfull of oil. Do you agree?\"\n\nThere was a short confab between the owner and the sailing master,\nending with the latter's calling out: \"We'll give you water and grub,\nbut don't shoot any more hardware at us. Come closer and throw a heaving\nline, and send your boat, if you like, for the grub. Our boats are all\nlashed down.\"\n\n\"That's reasonable,\" answered Forsythe. \"Hawkes, Davis, Daniels,\nBillings--you fellows clear away that boat of ours, and stand by to go\nfor the grub.\"\n\nThe two craft drew together, and for the rest it was like the other\nholdup. The hose was passed, and, while the tanks were filling, the boat\npassed back and forth, making three trips, heavily laden with barrels,\npackages, and boxes. Then, when Forsythe gave the word, the hose was\ndrawn back, the boat hoisted and secured, and the two craft separated\nwithout another word of threat or protest.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\"Fully committed,\" muttered Denman, as he drew back from the deadlight.\n\"They'll stop at nothing now.\"\n\nHe was about to open his door to visit Florrie, if she had descended,\nwhen it was opened from without by Billings, who had brought his\nbreakfast.\n\n\"We'll have better grub for a while, sir,\" he said, as he deposited the\ntray on the desk. \"Suppose you know what happened?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I see life imprisonment for all of you, unless you are killed\nin the catching.\"\n\n\"Can't help it, sir,\" answered Billings, with a deprecatory grin. \"We're\nnot going back to jail, nor will we starve on the high seas. All we're\nwaiting for is the course to the African coast--unless--\" He paused.\n\n\"Unless what?\" demanded Denman, leaning over his breakfast.\n\n\"Well--unless the vote is to stay at sea. We've got a good, fast boat\nunder us.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Continued piracy?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you any more, sir,\" answered Billings, and he went off,\nafter carefully locking the door behind him.\n\nWhen Denman had finished his breakfast, he quietly let himself out.\nTapping on the after door, he saw Florrie's shadow on the translucent\nglass, and opened it.\n\nShe stood before him with the bandages removed, and he saw her features\nfor the first time since she had come aboard. They were pink, and here\nand there was a blister that had not yet disappeared; but, even so\nhandicapped, her face shone with a beauty that he had never seen in a\nwoman nor imagined in the grown-up child that he remembered. The large,\nserious, gray eyes were the same; but the short, dark ringlets had\ndeveloped to a wealth of hair that would have suitably crowned a queen.\n\nDenman stood transfixed for a moment, then found his tongue.\n\n\"Florrie,\" he said, softly, so as not to be heard from above, \"is this\nreally you? I wouldn't have known you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" she answered, with a smile, which immediately changed to\na little grimace of pain. \"I was badly scalded, but I had to take off\nthe cloth to eat my breakfast.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I didn't mean that. I mean you've improved so. Why,\nFlorrie, you've grown up to be a beauty. I never imagined\nyou--you--looking so fine.\"\n\n\"Don't talk like that, Billie Denman. I'm disfigured for life, I know. I\ncan never show my face again.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Florrie. The redness will go away. But, tell me, why didn't\nyou go aboard that yacht? I overheard you talking to Sampson. Why didn't\nyou go, and get away from this bunch?\"\n\n\"I have just told you,\" she answered, while a tint overspread her pink\nface that did not come of the scalding. \"There were women on that yacht.\nDo you think I want to be stared at, and pitied, and laughed at?\"\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" said Denman; \"but I suppose it is a very\nvital reason for a woman. Yet, it's too bad. This boat is sure to be\ncaptured, and there may be gun fire. It's a bad place for you. But,\nFlorrie--let me tell you. Did you see what came on board from the\nyacht?\"\n\n\"Boxes, and barrels, and the water.\"\n\n\"Yes, and some of those boxes contained whisky and brandy. Whisky and\nbrandy make men forget that they are men. Have you a key for your door?\"\n\n\"No; I never saw one.\"\n\nDenman tried his bunch of keys on the stateroom door until he found the\nright one. This he took off the ring and inserted in the lock.\n\n\"Lock your door every time you go in there,\" he said, impressively;\n\"and, Florrie, another thing--keep that pretty face of yours out of\nsight of these men. Go right in there now and replace the bandages.\nThen, after a while, about nine o'clock, go on deck for a walk around,\nand then let me have your rig. I want a daylight look at things.\"\n\nShe acquiesced, and he went back to his room, locking himself in, just\nin time to escape the notice of Billings, who had come for the tray.\n\n\"Are you fellows going to deprive me of all exercise?\" he demanded.\n\"Even a man in irons is allowed to walk the deck a little.\"\n\n\"Don't know, sir,\" answered Billings. \"Forsythe is the man to talk to.\"\n\n\"I'll do more than talk to him,\" growled Denman between his teeth.\n\"Carry my request for exercise to him. Say that I demand the privileges\nof a convict.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir,\" answered Billings as he went out.\n\nIn a few moments he was back with the news that Forsythe had profanely\ndenied the request. Whereat Denman's heart hardened the more.\n\nHe remained quiet until two bells--nine o'clock--had struck, then went\nout and approached the after door, just in time to see Florrie's shadow\npass across the glass as she mounted the stairs. He waited, and in about\nfive minutes she came down, and, no doubt seeing his shadow on the door,\ntapped gently. He promptly opened it, and she said:\n\n\"Leave the door open and I will throw you my things in a minute. They\nare drinking up there.\"\n\n\"Drinking!\" he mused, as he waited. \"Well, perhaps I can get a gun if\nthey drink to stupidity.\"\n\nSoon Florrie's hand opened the door, and the garments came through.\nDenman had little trouble now in donning them, and, with his head tied\nup as before, he passed through the captain's apartment to the deck. It\nwas a mild, sunshiny morning, with little wind, and that from the\nnortheast. White globes of cloud showed here and there, and Denman knew\nthem for the unmistakable sign of the trade winds. But he was more\ninterested in matters on deck. All hands except Billings, who was\nsinging in the galley, and Munson, one of the wireless men, were\nclustered around the forward funnel; and there were several bottles\ncirculating around. Forsythe, with a sextant in his hand, was berating\nthem.\n\n\"Go slow, you infernal ginks,\" he snarled at them, \"or you'll be so\ndrunk in an hour that you won't know your names. Ready--in there,\nMunson?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Munson from the pilot-house.\n\nForsythe put the sextant to his eye, and swept it back and forth for a\nfew moments.\n\n\"Time,\" he called suddenly, and, lowering the sextant, looked in on\nMunson.\n\n\"Got it?\" asked Munson.\n\n\"Yes; and have it down in black and white.\" Forsythe made a notation\nfrom the sextant on a piece of paper.\n\n\"Now, again,\" said Forsythe, and again he took a sight, shouted, \"Time,\"\nand made another notation.\n\nThen he went into the pilot-house and Munson came out and made the\nshortest cut to the nearest bottle.\n\n\"He's taken chronometer sights,\" mused Denman, as he leaned against the\ncompanion hood. \"Well, he's progressing fast, but there never was a\ndoubt that he is a scholar.\"\n\nHe went down, and through a crack of the door obtained Miss Florrie's\npermission to keep the cloak and skirt for the morning, as he wanted to\nsee later how the drinking was progressing. Florrie consented, and he\nwent to his room to wait.\n\nAs he waited, the sounds above grew ominous. Oaths and loud laughter,\nshouts, whoops, and grumblings, mingled with Forsythe's angry voice of\ncommand, came down to him through the open deadlight. Soon he heard the\nthumping of human bodies on deck, and knew there was a fight going on.\n\nA fight always appealed to him; and, yielding to this unworthy\ncuriosity, Denman again passed through the captain's quarters, making\nsure on the way that Florrie was locked in, and reached the deck.\n\nThere were two fights in progress, one a stand-up-and-knock-down affair\nnear the pilot-house; the other a wrestling match amidships. He could\nnot recognize the contestants, and, with the thought that perhaps\nForsythe was one of them, stepped forward a few feet to observe.\n\nAt this moment Billings--the cheerful Billings--came up the galley\nhatch, no longer cheerful, but morose of face and menacing of gait, as\nis usual with this type of man when drunk. He spied Denman in his skirt,\ncloak, hat, and bandage, and, with a clucking chuckle in his throat and\na leering grin on his face, made for him.\n\n\"Say, old girl,\" he said, thickly. \"Let's have a kiss.\"\n\nDenman, anxious about his position and peculiar privilege, backed away;\nbut the unabashed pursuer still pursued, and caught him at the\ncompanion. He attempted to pass his arm around Denman, but did not\nsucceed. Denman pushed him back a few feet; then, with the whole weight\nof his body behind it, launched forth his fist, and struck the suitor\nsquarely between the eyes.\n\nBillings was lifted off his feet and hurled backward his whole length\nbefore he reached the deck; then he lay still for a moment, and as he\nshowed signs of life, Denman darted down to the wardroom, where he shed\nhis disguise as quickly as possible. Then he roused Florrie, passed the\ngarments in to her, warned her to keep her door locked, and went to his\nown room, locking the doors behind him.\n\nHe waited and listened, while the shouts and oaths above grew less, and\nfinally silent, though at times he recognized Forsythe's threatening\nvoice. He supposed that by now all of them except Forsythe were stupidly\ndrunk, and was much surprised when, at eight bells, Billings opened the\ndoor with his dinner, well cooked and savory. He was not quite sober,\nbut as sober as a drunken man may become who has had every nerve, sinew,\nand internal organ shocked as by the kick of a mule.\n\n\"Bad times on deck, sir,\" he said. \"This drinkin's all to the bad.\" He\nleered comically through his closed and blackened eyelids, and tried to\nsmile; but it was too painful, and his face straightened.\n\n\"Why, what has happened?\" inquired Denman. \"I heard the row, but\ncouldn't see.\"\n\n\"Nothin' serious, sir,\" answered Billings, \"except to me. Say, sir--that\nwoman aft. Keep away from her. Take it from me, sir, she's a bad un. Got\na punch like a battering-ram. Did you ever get the big end of a\nhandspike jammed into your face by a big man, sir? Well, that's the kind\nof a punch she has.\"\n\nBillings departed, and Denman grinned maliciously while he ate his\ndinner; and, after Billings had taken away the dishes--with more\ncomments on the woman's terrible punch--Denman went out into the\nwardroom, intending to visit Miss Florrie. A glance overhead stopped\nhim, and sent him back. The lubber's point on the telltale marked due\nwest northwest.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nHe sat down to think it out. Sampson had hinted at big things talked\nabout. Billings had spoken of a vote--to stay at sea or not. However,\nthere could have been no vote since Billings' last visit because of\ntheir condition. But Forsythe had indubitably taken chronometer sights\nin the morning, and, being most certainly sober, had doubtless worked\nthem out and ascertained the longitude, which, with a meridian\nobservation at noon, would give him the position of the yacht.\n\nThe \"big things\" requiring a vote were all in Forsythe's head, and he\nhad merely anticipated the vote. Not knowing their position himself,\nexcept as indicated by the trade-wind clouds, Denman could only surmise\nthat a west northwest course would hit the American coast somewhere\nbetween Boston and Charleston. But what they wanted there was beyond his\ncomprehension.\n\nHe gave up the puzzle at last, and visited Florrie, finding her dressed,\nswathed in the bandage, and sitting in the outer apartment, reading.\nBriefly he explained the occurrences on deck, and, as all was quiet now,\nasked her to step up and investigate. She did so, and returned.\n\n\"Forsythe is steering,\" she said, \"and two or three are awake, but\nstaggering around, and several others are asleep on the deck.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, hopefully, \"Forsythe evidently can control himself, but\nnot the others. If they remain drunk, or get drunker, I mean to do\nsomething to-night. No use trying now.\"\n\n\"What will you do, Billie?\" she asked, with concern in her voice.\n\n\"I don't know. I'll only know when I get at it. I hope that Forsythe\nwill load up, too. Hello! What's up? Run up, Florrie, and look.\"\n\nThe engine had stopped, and Forsythe's furious invective could be heard.\nFlorrie ran up the steps, peeped out, and returned.\n\n\"He is swearing at some one,\" she said.\n\n\"So it seems,\" said Denman. \"Let me have a look.\"\n\nHe ascended, and carefully peeped over the companion hood. Forsythe was\nlooking down the engine-room hatch, and his voice came clear and\ndistinct as he anathematized the engineers below.\n\n\"Shut off your oil, you drunken mutts,\" he vociferated. \"If the whole\nfour of you can't keep steam on the steering-gear, shut it off--all of\nit, I say. Shut off every burner and get into your bunks till you're\nsober.\"\n\nThen Sampson's deep voice arose from the hatch. \"You'll stop talking\nlike that to me, my lad, before long,\" he said, \"or I'll break some o'\nyour bones.\"\n\n\"Shut off the oil--every burner,\" reiterated Forsythe. \"We'll drift for\na while.\"\n\n\"Right you are,\" sang out another voice, which Denman recognized as\nDwyer's. \"And here, you blooming crank, take a drink and get into a good\nhumor.\"\n\n\"Pass it up, then. I need a drink by this time. _But shut off that\noil._\"\n\nDenman saw Forsythe reach down and bring up a bottle, from which he took\na deep draught. The electric lights slowly dimmed in the cabin,\nindicating the slowing down of the dynamo engine; then they went out.\n\nDenman descended, uneasy in mind, into the half darkness of the cabin.\nHe knew, from what he had learned of Forsythe, that the first drink\nwould lead to the second, and the third, and that his example would\ninfluence the rest to further drinking; but he gave none of his fears to\nFlorrie. He simply bade her to go into her room and lock the door. Then\nhe went to his own room against the possible advent of Billings at\nsupper-time.\n\nBut there was no supper for any that evening. Long before the time for\nit pandemonium raged above; and the loudest, angriest voice was that of\nForsythe, until, toward the last, Sampson's voice rose above it, and, as\na dull thud on the deck came to Denman's ears, he knew that his fist had\nsilenced it. Evidently the sleeping men had wakened to further\npotations; and at last the stumbling feet of some of them approached the\nstern. Then again came Sampson's voice.\n\n\"Come back here,\" he roared. \"Keep away from that companion, the lot of\nyou, or I'll give you what I gave Forsythe.\"\n\nA burst of invective and malediction answered him, and then there were\nthe sounds of conflict, even the crashing of fists as well as the thuds\non the deck, coming to Denman through the deadlight.\n\n\"Forrard wi' you all,\" continued Sampson between the sounds of impact;\nand soon the shuffling of feet indicated a retreat. Denman, who had\nopened his door, ready for a rush to Florrie's defense, now went aft to\nreassure her. She opened the door at his tap and his voice through the\nkeyhole.\n\n\"It's all right for the present, Florrie,\" he said. \"While Sampson is\nsober they won't come aft again.\"\n\n\"Oh, Billie,\" she gasped. \"I hope so. Don't desert me, Billie.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" he said, reassuringly. \"They'll all be stupid before\nlong, and then--to-night--there will be something doing on our side.\nNow, I must be in my room when Billings comes, or until I'm sure he\nwill not come. And you stay here. I'll be on hand if anything happens.\"\n\nHe went back to his room, but Billings did not come with his supper. And\none by one the voices above grew silent, and the shuffling footsteps\nended in thuds, as their owners dropped to the deck; and when darkness\nhad closed down and all above was still, Denman crept out to\nreconnoiter. He reached the door leading to the captain's room, and was\njust about to open it when a scream came to his ears.\n\n\"Billie! Billie--come--come quick! Help!\"\n\nThen a tense voice:\n\n\"Shut up your noise in there and open the door. I only want to have a\ntalk with you.\"\n\nDenman was into the room before the voice had ceased, and in the\ndarkness barely made out the figure of a man fumbling at the knob of the\nstateroom door. He knew, as much by intuition as by recognition of the\nvoice, that it was Forsythe, and, without a word of warning, sprang at\nhis throat.\n\nWith an oath Forsythe gripped him, and they swayed back and forth in the\nsmall cabin, locked together in an embrace that strained muscles and\nsinews to the utmost. Forsythe expended breath and energy in curses.\n\nDenman said nothing until Florrie screamed again, then he found voice to\ncall out:\n\n\"All right, Florrie, I've got him.\"\n\nShe remained silent while the battle continued. At first it was a\nwrestling match, each with a right arm around the body of the other, and\nwith Denman's left hand gripping Forsythe's left wrist. Their left hands\nswayed about, above their heads, to the right, to the left, and down\nbetween the close pressure of their chests.\n\nDenman soon found that he was the stronger of arm, for he twisted his\nenemy's arm around as he pleased; but he also found that he was not\nstronger of fingers, for suddenly Forsythe broke away from his grip and\nseized tightly the wrist of Denman.\n\nThus reversed, the battle continued, and as they reeled about, chairs,\ntable, and desk were overturned, making a racket as the combatants\nstumbled around over and among them that would have aroused all hands\nhad they been but normally asleep.\n\nAs it was, there was no interruption, and the two battled on in the\ndarkness to an end. It came soon. Forsythe suddenly released his clasp\non Denman's wrist and gripped his throat, then as suddenly he brought\nhis right hand up, and Denman felt the pressure of his thumb on his\nright eyeball. He was being choked and gouged; and, strangely enough, in\nthis exigency there came to him no thought of the trick by which he had\nmastered Jenkins. But instead, he mustered his strength, pushed Forsythe\nfrom him, and struck out blindly.\n\nIt was a lucky blow, for his eyes were filled with lights of various\nhue, and he could not see; yet his fist caught Forsythe on the chin, and\nDenman heard him crash back over the upturned table.\n\nForsythe uttered no sound, and when the light had gone out of his eyes,\nDenman groped for him, and found him, just beginning to move. He groaned\nand sat up.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\"No, you don't,\" said Denman, grimly. \"Fair play is wasted on you, so\nback you go to the Land of Nod.\"\n\nHe drew back his right fist, and again sent it crashing on the chin of\nhis victim, whom he could just see in the starlight from the companion,\nand Forsythe rolled back.\n\nLike Jenkins, he had arrayed himself in an officer's uniform, and there\nwas no convenient neckerchief with which to bind him; but Denman took\nhis own, and securely tied his hands behind his back, and with another\nstring tie from his room tied his ankles together. Then only did he\nthink of Florrie, and called to her. She answered hysterically.\n\n\"It's all right, Florrie girl,\" he said. \"It was Forsythe, but I've\nknocked him silly and have him tied hand and foot. Go to sleep now.\"\n\n\"I can't go to sleep, Billie,\" she wailed. \"I can't. Don't leave me\nalone any more.\"\n\n\"I must, Florrie,\" he answered. \"I'm going on deck to get them all. I'll\nnever have a better chance. Keep quiet and don't come out, no matter\nwhat you hear.\"\n\n\"But come back soon, Billie,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"I will, soon as I can. But stay quiet in there until I do.\"\n\nHe stole softly up the stairs and looked forward. The stars illuminated\nthe deck sufficiently for him to see the prostrate forms scattered\nabout, but not enough for him to distinguish one from another until he\nhad crept close. The big machinist, Sampson, he found nearest to the\ncompanion, as though he had picked this spot to guard, even in drunken\nsleep, the sacred after cabin. Denman's heart felt a little twinge of\npain as he softly untied and withdrew the big fellow's neckerchief and\nbound his hands behind him. Sampson snored on through the process.\n\nThe same with the others. Kelly, Daniels, and Billings lay near the\nafter funnel; Munson, Casey, Dwyer, and King were in the scuppers\namidships; Riley, Davis, and Hawkes were huddled close to the\npilot-house; and not a man moved in protest as Denman bound them, one\nand all, with their own neckerchiefs. There was one more, the stricken\nJenkins in the forecastle; and Denman descended and examined him by the\nlight of a match. He was awake, and blinked and grimaced at Denman,\nstriving to speak.\n\n\"Sorry for you, Jenkins,\" said Billie. \"You'll get well in time, but\nyou'll have to wait. You're harmless enough now, however.\"\n\nThere was more to do before he felt secure of his victory. He must tie\ntheir ankles; and, as neckerchiefs had run out, he sought, by the light\nof matches, the \"bos'n's locker\" in the fore peak. Here he found spun\nyarn, and, cutting enough lengths of it, he came up and finished the\njob, tying knots so hard and seamanly that the strongest fingers of a\nfellow prisoner could not untie them. Then he went aft.\n\nForsythe was still unconscious. But he regained his senses while Denman\ndragged him up the steps and forward beside his enemy, Sampson; and he\nemitted various sulphurous comments on the situation that cannot be\nrecorded here.\n\nDenman wanted the weapons; but, with engines dead, there was no light\nsave from his very small supply of matches, and for the simple, and\nperhaps very natural, desire to save these for his cigar lights, he\nforbore a search for them beyond an examination of each man's pockets.\nHe found nothing, however. It seemed that they must have agreed upon\ndisarmament before the drinking began. But from Forsythe he secured a\nbunch of keys, which he was to find useful later on.\n\nAll else was well. Each man was bound hand and foot, Jenkins was still a\nliving corpse; and Forsythe, the soberest of the lot, had apparently\nsuccumbed to the hard knocks of the day, and gone to sleep again. So\nDenman went down, held a jubilant conversation with Florrie through the\nkeyhole, and returned to the deck, where, with a short spanner in his\nhand--replevined from the engine room for use in case of an\nemergency--he spent the night on watch; for, with all lights out, a\nwatch was necessary.\n\nBut nothing happened. The men snored away their drunkenness, and at\ndaylight most of them were awake and aware of their plight. Denman paid\nno attention to their questions; but, when the light permitted, went on\na search for the arms and irons, which he found in the forecastle,\ncarefully stowed in a bunk.\n\nHe counted the pistols, and satisfied himself that all were there; then\nhe carried them aft to his room, belted himself with one of them, and\nreturned for the cutlasses, which he hid in another room.\n\nBut the irons he spread along the deck, and, while they cursed and\nmaligned him, he replaced the silk and spun-yarn fetters with manacles\nof steel. Next he dragged the protesting prisoners from forward and aft\nuntil he had them bunched amidships, and then, walking back and forth\nbefore them, delivered a short, comprehensive lecture on the unwisdom of\nstealing torpedo-boat destroyers and getting drunk.\n\nLike all lecturers, he allowed his audience to answer, and when he had\nrefuted the last argument, he unlocked the irons of Billings and Daniels\nand sternly ordered them to cook breakfast.\n\nThey meekly arose and went to the galley, from which, before long,\nsavory odors arose. And, while waiting for breakfast, Denman aroused\nMiss Florrie and brought her on deck, clothed and bandaged, to show her\nhis catch.\n\n\"And what will you do now, Billie?\" she asked, as she looked at the\nunhappy men amidships.\n\n\"Haven't the slightest idea. I've got to think it out. I'll have to\nrelease some of them to work the boat, and I'll have to shut down and\niron them while I sleep, I suppose. I've already freed the two cooks,\nand we'll have breakfast soon.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that,\" she answered. \"There was no supper last night.\"\n\n\"And I'm hungry as a wolf myself. Well, they are hungry, too. We'll have\nour breakfast on deck before they get theirs. Perhaps the sight will\nbring them to terms.\"\n\n\"Why cannot I help, Billie?\" asked the girl. \"I could watch while you\nwere asleep, and wake you if anything happened.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Florrie girl. Of course I'll throw the stuff overboard, but I\nwouldn't trust some of them, drunk or sober.\"\n\nBillings soon reported breakfast ready, and asked how he should serve\nthe captives.\n\n\"Do not serve them at all,\" said Denman, sharply. \"Bring the cabin table\non deck, and place it on the starboard quarter. Serve breakfast for two,\nand you and Daniels eat your own in the galley.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir,\" answered the subdued Billings, with a glance at the\nlong, blue revolver at Denman's waist. He departed, and with Daniels'\nhelp arranged the breakfast as ordered.\n\nFlorrie was forced to remove her bandage; but as she faced aft at the\ntable her face was visible to Denman only. He faced forward, and while\nhe ate he watched the men, who squirmed as the appetizing odors of\nbroiled ham, corn bread, and coffee assailed their nostrils. On each\ncountenance, besides the puffed, bloated appearance coming of heavy and\nunaccustomed drinking, was a look of anxiety and disquiet. But they were\nfar from being conquered--in spirit, at least.\n\nBreakfast over, Denman sent Florrie below, ordered the dishes and table\nbelow, and again put the irons on Billings and Daniels. Then he went\namong them.\n\n\"What do you mean to do?\" asked Forsythe, surlily, as Denman looked down\non him. \"Keep us here and starve us?\"\n\n\"I will keep you in irons while I have the power,\" answered Denman, \"no\nmatter what I may do with the others. Sampson,\" he said to the big\nmachinist, \"you played a man's part last night, and I feel strongly in\nfavor of releasing you on parole. You understand the nature of parole,\ndo you not?\"\n\n\"I do, sir,\" answered the big fellow, thickly, \"and if I give it, I\nwould stick to it. What are the conditions, sir?\"\n\n\"That you stand watch and watch with me while we take this boat back to\nBoston; that you aid me in keeping this crowd in subjection; that you do\nyour part in protecting the lady aft from annoyance. In return, I\npromise you my influence at Washington. I have some, and can arouse\nmore. You will, in all probability, be pardoned.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" answered Sampson, promptly. \"I am one of this crowd--you are\nnot one of us. I wouldn't deserve a pardon if I went back on my\nmates--even this dog alongside of me. He's one of us, too; and, while I\nhave smashed him, and will smash him again, I will not accept my liberty\nwhile he, or any of the others, is in irons.\"\n\nDenman bowed low to him, and went on. He questioned only a few--those\nwho seemed trustworthy--but met with the same response, and he left\nthem, troubled in mind.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nHe sat down in a deck chair and lighted a cigar as an aid to his mental\nprocesses. Three projects presented themselves to his mind, each of\nwhich included, of course, the throwing overboard of the liquor and the\nsecure hiding of the arms, except a pistol for himself, and one for\nFlorrie.\n\nThe first was to release them all, and, backed by his pistol, his\nuniform, and the power of the government, to treat them as mutineers,\nand shoot them if they defied or disobeyed him.\n\nTo this was the logical objection that they were already more than\nmutineers--that there was no future for them; that, even though he\noverawed and conquered them, compelling them to work the boat shoreward,\neach passing minute would find them more keen to revolt; and that, if\nthey rushed him in a body, he could only halt a few--the others would\nmaster him.\n\nThe second plan was born of his thoughts before breakfast. It was to\nrelease one cook, one engineer, and one helmsman at a time; to guard\nthem until sleep was necessary, then to shut off steam, lock them up,\nand allow the boat to drift while they slept. Against this plan was the\nabsolute necessity, to a seaman's mind, of a watch--even a one-man\nwatch--and this one man could work mischief while he slept--could even,\nif handy with tools, file out a key that would unlock the shackles.\n\nThe third plan was to starve them into contrition and subjection,\ntorturing them the while with the odors of food cooked for himself and\nFlorrie. But this was an inhuman expedient, only to be considered as a\nlast resource; and, besides, it would not affect the man doing the\ncooking, who could keep himself well fed and obdurate. And, even though\nthey surrendered and worked their way back toward prison, would their\nsurrender last beyond a couple of good meals? He thought not. Yet out of\nthis plan came another, and he went down the companion.\n\n\"Florrie,\" he called, \"can you cook?\"\n\nShe appeared at the stateroom door without her bandages, smiling at his\nquery, and for the moment Denman forgot all about his plans. Though the\npink tinge still overspread her face, the blisters were gone, and, in\nthe half light of the cabin, it shone with a new beauty that had not\nappeared to him in the garish sunlight when at breakfast--when he was\nintent upon watching the men. His heart gave a sudden jump, and his\nvoice was a little unsteady as he repeated the question.\n\n\"Why, yes, Billie,\" she answered, \"I know something about cooking--not\nmuch, though.\"\n\n\"Will you cook for yourself and me?\" he asked. \"If so, I'll keep the men\nlocked up, and we'll wait for something to come along.\"\n\n\"I will,\" she said; \"but you must keep them locked up, Billie.\"\n\n\"I'll do that, and fit you out with a pistol, too. I'll get you one\nnow.\"\n\nHe brought her a revolver, fully loaded, with a further supply of\ncartridges, and fitted the belt around her waist. Then, his heart still\njumping, he went on deck.\n\n\"Love her?\" he mused, joyously. \"Of course. Why didn't I think of it\nbefore?\"\n\nBut there was work to be done, and he set himself about it. He searched\nthe storerooms and inspected the forecastle. In the first he found\nseveral cases of liquor--also a barrel of hard bread. In the forecastle\nhe found that the water supply was furnished by a small faucet on the\nafter bulkhead. Trying it, he found a clear flow. Then he selected from\nhis bunch of keys the one belonging to the forecastle door, and put it\nin the lock--outside. Next, with a few cautionary remarks to the men, he\nunlocked their wrist irons one by one; and, after making each man place\nhis hands in front, relocked the irons.\n\n\"Now, then,\" he said, standing up over the last man, \"you can help\nyourselves and Jenkins to bread and water. One by one get up on your\nfeet and pass into the forecastle. If any man needs help, I will assist\nhim.\"\n\nSome managed to scramble to their feet unaided, while others could not.\nThese Denman helped; but, as he assisted them with one hand, holding his\npistol in the other, there was no demonstration against him with doubled\nfists--which is possible and potential. Mumbling and muttering, they\nfloundered down the small hatch and forward into the forecastle. The\nlast in the line was Sampson, and Denman stopped him.\n\n\"I've a job for you, Sampson,\" he said, after the rest had disappeared.\n\"You are the strongest man in the crowd. Go down the hatch, but aft to\nthe storeroom, and get that barrel of hard bread into the forecastle.\nYou can do it without my unlocking you.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir,\" answered Sampson, respectfully, and descended.\n\nDenman watched him from above, as, with his manacled hands, he twirled\nthe heavy barrel forward and into the men's quarters.\n\n\"Shut the door, turn the key on them, and come aft here,\" he commanded.\n\nSampson obeyed.\n\n\"Now, lift up on deck and then toss overboard every case of liquor in\nthat storeroom.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\" And up came six cases, as easily in his powerful grip\nas though they had been bandboxes, and then he hoisted his own huge bulk\nto the deck.\n\n\"Over the side with them all,\" commanded Denman.\n\nSampson picked them up, and, whether or not it came from temper, threw\nthem from where he stood, above and beyond the rail; but the fifth\nstruck the rail, and fell back to the deck. He advanced and threw it\nover.\n\n\"Carry the other one,\" said Denman, and Sampson lifted it up. It was a\nlow, skeleton rail, and, as the big man hobbled toward it,\nsomehow--neither he nor Denman ever knew how--his foot slipped, and he\nand the box went overboard together. The box floated, but when Sampson\ncame to the surface it was out of his reach.\n\n\"Help!\" he gurgled. \"I can't swim.\"\n\nWithout a thought, Denman laid his pistol on the deck, shed his coat,\nand dove overboard, reaching the struggling man in three strokes.\n\n\"Keep still,\" he commanded, as he got behind and secured a light but\nsecure grip on Sampson's hair. \"Tread water if you can, but don't\nstruggle. I'll tow you back to the boat.\"\n\nBut, though Sampson grew quiet and Denman succeeded in reaching the\ndark, steel side, there was nothing to catch hold of--not a trailing\nrope, nor eyebolt, nor even the open deadlights, for they were high out\nof reach. The crew were locked in the forecastle, and there was only\nFlorrie. There was no wind, and only the long, heaving ground swell,\nwhich rolled the boat slightly, but not enough to bring those\ntantalizing deadlights within reach; and at last, at the sound of dishes\nrattling in the galley, Denman called out.\n\n\"Florrie!\" he shouted. \"Florrie, come on deck. Throw a rope over.\nFlorrie--oh, Florrie!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nShe came hurriedly, and peered over the rail with a startled, frightened\nexpression. Then she screamed.\n\n\"Can you see any ropes lying on deck, Florrie?\" called Denman. \"If you\ncan, throw one over.\"\n\nShe disappeared for a moment, then came back, and cried out frantically:\n\"No, there is nothing--no ropes. What shall I do?\"\n\n\"Go down and get the tablecloth,\" said Denman, as calmly as he could,\nwith his nose just out of water and a big, heavy, frightened man bearing\nhim down.\n\nFlorrie vanished, and soon reappeared with the tablecloth of the\nmorning's breakfast. It was a cloth of generous size, and she lowered it\nover.\n\n\"Tie one corner to the rail, Florrie,\" said Denman, while he held the\nirresponsible Sampson away from the still frail support. She obeyed him,\ntying the knot that all women tie but which no sailor can name, and then\nDenman led his man up to it.\n\nSampson clutched it with both hands, drew it taut, and supported his\nweight on it. Fortunately the knot did not slip. Denman also held\nhimself up by it until he had recovered his breath, then cast about for\nmeans of getting on board. He felt that the tablecloth would not bear\nhis weight and that of his water-soaked clothing, and temporarily gave\nup the plan of climbing it.\n\nForward were the signal halyards; but they, too, were of small line,\nand, even if doubled again and again until strong enough, he knew by\nexperience the wonderful strength of arm required in climbing out of\nthe water hand over hand. This thought also removed the tablecloth from\nthe problem; but suggested another by its association with the necessity\nof feet in climbing with wet clothes.\n\nHe remembered that forward, just under the anchor davit, was a small,\nfixed ladder, bolted into the bow of the boat for use in getting the\nanchor. So, cautioning Sampson not to let go, he swam forward, with\nFlorrie's frightened face following above, and, reaching the ladder,\neasily climbed on board. He was on the high forecastle deck, but the\ngirl had reached it before him.\n\n\"Billie,\" she exclaimed, as she approached him. \"Oh, Billie--\"\n\nHe caught her just as her face grew white and her figure limp, and\nforgot Sampson for the moment. The kisses he planted on her lips and\ncheek forestalled the fainting spell, and she roused herself.\n\n\"I thought you would drown, Billie,\" she said, weakly, with her face of\na deeper pink than he had seen. \"Don't drown, Billie--don't do that\nagain. Don't leave me alone.\"\n\n\"I won't, Florrie,\" he answered, stoutly and smilingly. \"I'm born to be\nhanged, you know. I won't drown. Come on--I must get Sampson.\"\n\nThey descended--Denman picking up his pistol on the way--and found\nSampson quietly waiting at the end of the tablecloth. With his life\ntemporarily safe, his natural courage had come to him.\n\n\"I'm going to tow you forward to the anchor ladder, Sampson. You'll have\nto climb it the best way you can; for there isn't a purchase on board\nthat will bear your weight. Hold tight now.\"\n\nHe untied Florrie's knot, and slowly dragged the big man forward,\nexperiencing a check at the break of the forecastle, where he had to\nhalt and piece out the tablecloth with a length of signal halyards, but\nfinally got Sampson to the ladder. Sampson had some trouble in mounting,\nfor his shackles would not permit one hand to reach up to a rung without\nletting go with the other; but he finally accomplished the feat, and\nfloundered over the rail, where he sat on deck to recover himself.\nFinally he scrambled to his feet.\n\n\"Mr. Denman,\" he said, \"you've saved my life for me, and whatever I can\ndo for you, except\"--his face took on a look of embarrassment--\"except\ngoing back on my mates, as I said, I will do, at any time of my life.\"\n\n\"That was what I might have suggested,\" answered Denman, calmly, \"that\nyou aid me in controlling this crew until we reach Boston.\"\n\n\"I cannot, sir. There is prison for life for all of us if we are taken;\nand this crowd will break out, sir--mark my words. You won't have charge\nvery long. But--in that case--I mean--I might be of service. I can\ncontrol them all, even Forsythe, when I am awake.\"\n\n\"Forsythe!\" grinned Denman. \"You can thank Forsythe for your round-up.\nIf he hadn't remained sober enough to attempt to break into Miss\nFleming's room while you were all dead drunk, I might not have knocked\nhim out, and might not have roused myself to tie you all hand and foot.\"\n\n\"Did he do that, sir?\" asked Sampson, his rugged features darkening.\n\n\"He did; but I got there in time to knock him out.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Sampson, \"I can promise you this much. I must be\nlocked up, of course--I realize that. But, if we again get charge, I\nmust be asleep part of the time, and so I will see to it that you\nretain possession of your gun--and the lady, too, as I see she carries\none; also, sir, that you will have the run of the deck--on parole, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"That is kind of you,\" smiled Denman; \"but I don't mean to let you take\ncharge. It is bread and water for you all until something comes along to\nfurnish me a crew. Come on, Sampson--to the forecastle.\"\n\nSampson preceded him down the steps, down the hatch, and to the\nforecastle door, through which Denman admitted him; then relocked the\ndoor and bunched the key with his others. Then he joined Florrie, where\nshe had waited amidships.\n\n\"Now, then, Florrie girl,\" he said, jubilantly, \"you can have the use of\nthe deck, and go and come as you like. I'm going to turn in. You see, I\nwas awake all night.\"\n\n\"Are they secured safely, Billie?\" she asked, tremulously.\n\n\"Got them all in the forecastle, in double irons, with plenty of\nhard-tack and water. We needn't bother about them any more. Just keep\nyour eyes open for a sail, or smoke on the horizon; and if you see\nanything, call me.\"\n\n\"I will,\" she answered; \"and I'll have dinner ready at noon.\"\n\n\"That's good. A few hours' sleep will be enough, and then I'll try and\npolish up what I once learned about wireless. And say, Florrie. Next\ntime you go below, look in the glass and see how nice you look.\"\n\nShe turned her back to him, and he went down. In five minutes he was\nasleep. And, as he slipped off into unconsciousness, there came to his\nmind the thought that one man in the forecastle was not manacled; and\nwhen Florrie wakened him at noon the thought was still with him, but he\ndismissed it. Jenkins was helpless for a while, unable to move or\nspeak, and need not be considered.\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nFlorrie had proved herself a good cook, and they ate dinner together,\nthen Denman went on deck. The boat was still rolling on a calm sea; but\nthe long, steady, low-moving hills of blue were now mingled with a cross\nswell from the northwest, which indicated a push from beyond the horizon\nnot connected with the trade wind. And in the west a low bank of cloud\nrose up from, and merged its lower edge with, the horizon; while still\nhigher shone a \"mackerel sky,\" and \"mare's tail\" clouds--sure index of\ncoming wind. But there was nothing on the horizon in the way of sail or\nsmoke; and, anticipating another long night watch, he began preparations\nfor it.\n\nThree red lights at the masthead were needed as a signal that the\nboat--a steamer--was not under command. These he found in the lamp room.\nHe filled, trimmed, and rigged them to the signal halyards on the\nbridge, ready for hoisting at nightfall. Then, for a day signal of\ndistress, he hoisted an ensign--union down--at the small yard aloft.\n\nNext in his mind came the wish to know his position, and he examined the\nlog book. Forsythe had made an attempt to start a record; and out of his\ncrude efforts Denman picked the figures which he had noted down as the\nlatitude and longitude at noon of the day before. He corrected this with\nthe boat's course throughout the afternoon until the time of shutting\noff the oil feed, and added the influence of a current, which his more\nexpert knowledge told him of. Thirty-one, north, and fifty-five, forty,\nwest was the approximate position, and he jotted it down.\n\nThis done, he thought of the possibility of lighting the boat through\nthe night, and sought the engine room. He was but a theoretical\nengineer, having devoted most of his studies to the duties of a line\nofficer; but he mastered in a short time the management of the small gas\nengine that worked the dynamo, and soon had it going. Electric bulbs in\nthe engine room sprang into life; and, after watching the engine for a\nshort time, he decided that it required only occasional inspection, and\nsought the deck.\n\nThe cross sea was increasing, and the bank to the northwest was larger\nand blacker, while the mare's tails and mackerel scales had given way to\ncirrus clouds that raced across the sky. Damp gusts of wind blew, cold\nand heavy, against his cheek; and he knew that a storm was coming that\nwould try out the low-built craft to the last of its powers. But before\nit came he would polish up his forgotten knowledge of wireless\ntelegraphy, and searched the wireless room for books.\n\nHe found everything but what he wanted most--the code book, by which he\ncould furbish up on dots and dashes. Angry at his bad memory, he studied\nthe apparatus, found it in working order, and left the task to go on\ndeck.\n\nAn increased rolling of the boat threatened the open deadlights.\nTrusting that the men in the forecastle would close theirs, he attended\nto all the others, then sought Florrie in the galley, where she had just\nfinished the washing of the dishes. Her face was not pale, but there was\na wild look in her eyes, and she was somewhat unsteady on her feet.\n\n\"Oh, Billie, I'm sick--seasick,\" she said, weakly. \"I'm a poor sailor.\"\n\n\"Go to bed, little girl,\" he said, gently. \"We're going to have some\nbad weather, but we're all right. So stay in bed.\"\n\nHe supported her aft through the wardroom to her stateroom door in the\nafter cabin. \"I'll get supper, Florrie, and, if you can eat, I'll bring\nyou some. Lie down now, and don't get up until I call you, or until you\nfeel better.\"\n\nHe again sought the deck. The wind now came steadily, while the whole\nsky above and the sea about were assuming the gray hue of a gale. He\nclosed all hatches and companions, taking a peep down into the engine\nroom before closing it up. The dynamo was buzzing finely.\n\nA few splashes of rain fell on him, and he clothed himself in oilskins\nand rubber boots to watch out the gale, choosing to remain aft--where\nhis footsteps over her might reassure the seasick girl below--instead of\nthe bridge, where he would have placed himself under normal conditions.\n\nThe afternoon wore on, each hour marked by a heavier pressure of the\nwind and an increasing height to the seas, which, at first just lapping\nat the rail, now lifted up and washed across the deck. The boat rolled\nsomewhat, but not to add to his discomfort or that of those below; and\nthere were no loose articles on deck to be washed overboard.\n\nSo Denman paced the deck, occasionally peeping down the engine-room\nhatch at the dynamo, and again trying the drift by the old-fashioned\nchip-and-reel log at the stern. When tired, he would sit down in the\ndeck chair, which he had wedged between the after torpedo and the\ntaffrail, then resume his pacing.\n\nAs darkness closed down, he sought Florrie's door, and asked her if she\nwould eat something. She was too ill, she said; and, knowing that no\nwords could comfort her, he left her, and in the galley ate his own\nsupper--tinned meat, bread, and coffee.\n\nAgain the deck, the intermittent pacing, and resting in the chair. The\ngale became a hurricane in the occasional squalls; and at these times\nthe seas were beaten to a level of creamy froth luminous with a\nphosphorescent glow, while the boat's rolling motion would give way to a\nstiff inclination to starboard of fully ten degrees. Then the squalls\nwould pass, the seas rise the higher for their momentary suppression,\nand the boat resume her wallowing, rolling both rails under, and\npractically under water, except for the high forecastle deck, the\nfunnels, and the companions.\n\nDenman did not worry. With the wind northwest, the storm center was\nsurely to the north and east-ward of him; and he knew that, according to\nthe laws of storms in the North Atlantic, it would move away from him\nand out to sea.\n\nAnd so it continued until about midnight, when he heard the rasping of\nthe companion hood, then saw Florrie's face peering out. He sprang to\nthe companion.\n\n\"Billie! Oh, Billie!\" she said, plaintively. \"Let me come up here with\nyou?\"\n\n\"But you'll feel better lying down, dear,\" he said. \"Better go back.\"\n\n\"It's so close and hot down there. Please let me come up.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, Florrie, if you like; but wait until I fit you out. Come down\na moment.\"\n\nThey descended, and he found rubber boots, a sou'wester, and a long\noilskin coat, which she donned in her room. Then he brought up another\nchair, lashed it--with more neckties--to his own, and seated her in it.\n\n\"Don't be frightened,\" he said, as a sea climbed on board and washed\naft, nearly flooding their rubber boots and eliciting a little scream\nfrom the girl. \"We're safe, and the wind will blow out in a few hours.\"\n\nHe seated himself beside her. As they faced to leeward, the long brims\nof the sou'westers sheltered their faces from the blast of rain and\nspume, permitting conversation; but they did not converse for a time,\nDenman only reaching up inside the long sleeve of her big coat to where\nher small hand nestled, soft and warm, in its shelter. He squeezed it\ngently, but there was no answering pressure, and he contented himself\nwith holding it.\n\nHe was a good sailor, but a poor lover, and--a reeling, water-washed\ndeck in a gale of wind is an embarrassing obstacle to love-making. Yet\nhe squeezed again, after ten minutes of silence had gone by and several\nseas had bombarded their feet. Still no response in kind, and he spoke.\n\n\"Florrie,\" he said, as gently as he could when he was compelled to\nshout, \"do you remember the letter you sent me the other day?\"\n\n\"The other day,\" she answered. \"Why, it seems years since then.\"\n\n\"Last week, Florrie. It made me feel like--like thirty cents.\"\n\n\"Why, Billie?\"\n\n\"Oh, the unwritten roast between the lines, little girl. I knew what you\nthought of me. I knew that I'd never made good.\"\n\n\"How--what do you mean?\"\n\n\"About the fight--years ago. I was to come back and lick him, you know,\nand didn't--that's all.\"\n\n\"Are you still thinking of that, Billie? Why, you've won. You are an\nofficer, while he is a sailor.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he licked me at school, and I know you expected me to come\nback.\"\n\n\"And you did not come back. You never let me hear from you. You might\nhave been dead for years before I could know it.\"\n\n\"Is that it, Florrie?\" he exclaimed, in amazement. \"Was it me you\nthought of? I supposed you had grown to despise me.\"\n\nShe did not answer this; but when he again pressed her hand she\nresponded. Then, over the sounds of the storm, he heard a little sob;\nand, reaching over, drew her face close to his, and kissed her.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Florrie, but I didn't know. I've loved you all these years,\nbut I did not know it until a few days ago. And I'll never forget it,\nFlorrie, and I promise you--and myself, too--that I'll still make good,\nas I promised before.\"\n\nPoor lover though he was, he had won. She did not answer, but her own\nsmall hand reached for his.\n\nAnd so they passed the night, until, just as a lighter gray shone in the\neast, he noticed that one of the red lamps at the signal yard had gone\nout. As the lights were still necessary, he went forward to lower them;\nbut, just as he was about to mount the bridge stairs, a crashing blow\nfrom two heavy fists sent him headlong and senseless to the deck.\n\nWhen he came to, he was bound hand and foot as he had bound the\nmen--with neckerchiefs--and lay close to the forward funnel, with the\nwhole thirteen, Jenkins and all, looking down at him. But Jenkins was\nnot speaking. Forsythe, searching Denman's pockets, was doing all that\nthe occasion required.\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nWhen Sampson had entered the forecastle after his rescue by Denman, he\nfound a few of his mates in their bunks, the rest sitting around in\ndisconsolate postures, some holding their aching heads, others looking\nindifferently at him with bleary eyes. The apartment, long and\ntriangular in shape, was dimly lighted by four deadlights, two each\nside, and for a moment Sampson could not distinguish one from another.\n\n\"Where's my bag?\" he demanded, generally. \"I want dry clothes.\"\n\nHe groped his way to the bunk he had occupied, found his clothes bag,\nand drew out a complete change of garments.\n\n\"Who's got a knife?\" was his next request; and, as no one answered, he\nrepeated the demand in a louder voice.\n\n\"What d'you want of a knife?\" asked Forsythe, with a slight snarl.\n\n\"To cut your throat, you hang-dog scoundrel,\" said Sampson, irately.\n\"Forsythe, you speak kindly and gently to me while we're together, or\nI'll break some o' your small bones. Who's got a knife?\"\n\n\"Here's one, Sampson,\" said Hawkes, offering one of the square-bladed\njackknives used in the navy.\n\n\"All right, Hawkes. Now, will you stand up and rip these wet duds off\nme? I can't get 'em off with the darbies in the way.\"\n\nHawkes stood up and obeyed him. Soon the dripping garments fell away,\nand Sampson rubbed himself dry with a towel, while Hawkes sleepily\nturned in.\n\n\"What kept you, and what happened?\" asked Kelly. \"Did he douse you with\na bucket o' water?\"\n\nSampson did not answer at once--not until he had slashed the side seams\nof a whole new suit, and crawled into it. Then, as he began fastening it\non with buttons and strings, he said, coldly:\n\n\"Worse than that. He's made me his friend.\"\n\n\"His friend?\" queried two or three.\n\n\"His friend,\" repeated Sampson. \"Not exactly while he has me locked\nup,\" he added; \"but if I ever get out again--that's all. And his friend\nin some ways while I'm here. D'you hear that, Forsythe?\"\n\nForsythe did not answer, and Sampson went on: \"And not only his friend,\nbut the woman's too. Hear that, Forsythe?\"\n\nForsythe refused to answer.\n\n\"That's right, and proper,\" went on Sampson, as he fastened the last\nbutton. \"Hide your head and saw wood, you snake-eyed imitation of a\nman.\"\n\n\"What's up, Sampson?\" wearily asked Casey from a bunk. \"What doused you,\nand what you got on Forsythe now?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you in good time,\" responded Sampson. \"I'll tell you now\nabout Denman. I threw all the booze overboard at his orders. Then _I_\ntumbled over; and, as I can't swim, would ha' been there yet if he\nhadn't jumped after me. Then we couldn't get up the side, and the woman\ncome with a tablecloth, that held me up until I was towed to the anchor\nladder. That's all. I just want to hear one o' you ginks say a word\nabout that woman that she wouldn't like to hear. That's for you all--and\nfor _you_, Forsythe, a little more in good time.\"\n\n\"Bully for the woman!\" growled old Kelly. \"Wonder if we treated her\nright.\"\n\n\"We treated her as well as we knew how,\" said Sampson; \"that is, all but\none of us. But I've promised Denman, and the woman, through him, that\nthey'll have a better show if we get charge again.\"\n\n\"Aw, forget it!\" grunted Forsythe from his bunk. \"She's no good. She's\nbeen stuck on that baby since she was a kid.\"\n\nSampson went toward him, seized him by the shirt collar, and pulled him\nbodily from the bunk. Then, smothering his protesting voice by a grip on\nhis throat, slatted him from side to side as a farmer uses a flail, and\nthrew him headlong against the after bulkhead and half-way into an empty\nbunk. Sampson had uttered no word, and Forsythe only muttered as he\ncrawled back to his own bunk. But he found courage to say:\n\n\"What do you pick on me for? If you hadn't all got drunk, you wouldn't\nbe here.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said Sampson, quietly, \"that if you hadn't remained sober\nenough to find your way into the after cabin and frighten the woman, we\nwouldn't ha' been here; for that's what roused Denman.\"\n\nA few oaths and growls followed this, and men sat up in their bunks,\nwhile those that were out of their bunks stood up. Sampson sat down.\n\n\"Is that so, Sampson?\" \"Got that right, old man?\" \"Sure of it?\" they\nasked, and then over the hubbub of profane indignation rose Forsythe's\nvoice.\n\n\"Who gave you that?\" he yelled. \"Denman?\"\n\n\"Yes--Denman,\" answered Sampson.\n\n\"He lied. I did nothing of the--\"\n\n\"You lie yourself, you dog. You're showing on your chin the marks of\nDenman's fist.\"\n\n\"You did that just now,\" answered Forsythe, fingering a small, bleeding\nbruise.\n\n\"I didn't hit you. I choked you. Denman knocked you out.\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered Forsythe, forgetting the first accusation in the light\nof this last, \"it was a lucky blow in the dark. He couldn't do it in the\ndaylight.\"\n\n\"Self-convicted,\" said Sampson, quietly.\n\nThen, for a matter of ten minutes, the air in the close compartment\nmight have smelled sulphurous to one strange to forecastle discourse.\nForsythe, his back toward them, listened quietly while they called him\nall the names, printable and unprintable, which angry and disgusted men\nmay think of.\n\nBut when it had ended--when the last voice had silenced and the last man\ngone to the water faucet for a drink before turning in, Forsythe said:\n\n\"I'll even things up with you fellows if I get on deck again.\"\n\nOnly a few grunts answered him, and soon all were asleep.\n\nThey wakened, one by one, in the afternoon, to find the electric bulbs\nglowing, and the boat rolling heavily, while splashes of rain came in\nthrough the weather deadlights. These they closed; and, better humored\nafter their sleep, and hungry as well, they attacked the barrel of bread\nand the water faucet.\n\n\"He's started the dynamo,\" remarked Riley, one of the engineers. \"Why\ndon't he start the engine and keep her head to the sea?\"\n\n\"Because he knows too much,\" came a hoarse whisper, and they turned to\nJenkins, who was sitting up, regarding them disapprovingly.\n\n\"Because he knows too much,\" he repeated, in the same hoarse whisper.\n\"This is a so-called seagoing destroyer; but no one but a fool would\nbuck one into a head sea; and that's what's coming, with a big blow,\ntoo. Remember the English boat that broke her back in the North Sea?\"\n\n\"Hello, Jenkins--you alive?\" answered one, and others asked of his\nhealth.\n\n\"I'm pretty near all right,\" he said to them. \"I've been able to move\nand speak a little for twenty-four hours, but I saved my energy. I\nwasn't sure of myself, though, or I'd ha' nabbed Denman when he came in\nhere for the pistols.\"\n\n\"Has he got them?\" queried a few, and they examined the empty bunk.\n\n\"He sure has,\" they continued. \"Got 'em all. Oh, we're in for it.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" said Jenkins. \"I've listened to all this powwow, and\nI gather that you got drunk to the last man, and he gathered you in.\"\n\n\"That's about it, Jenkins,\" assented Sampson. \"We all got gloriously\ndrunk.\"\n\n\"And before you got drunk you made this pin-headed, educated rat\"--he\njerked his thumb toward Forsythe--\"your commander.\"\n\n\"Well--we needed a navigator, and you were out of commission, Jenkins.\"\n\n\"I'm in commission now, though, and when we get on deck, we'll still\nhave a navigator, and it won't be Denman, either.\"\n\n\"D'you mean,\" began Forsythe, \"that you'll take charge again, and\nmake--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jenkins, \"make you navigate. Make you navigate under orders\nand under fear of punishment. You're the worst-hammered man in this\ncrowd; but hammering doesn't improve you. You'll be keelhauled, or\ntriced up by the thumbs, or spread-eagled over a boiler--but you'll\nnavigate. Now, shut up.\"\n\nThere was silence for a while, then one said: \"You spoke about getting\non deck again, Jenkins. Got any plan?\"\n\n\"Want to go on deck now and stand watch in this storm?\" Jenkins\nretorted.\n\n\"No; not unless necessary.\"\n\n\"Then get into your bunk and wait for this to blow over. If there is any\nreal need of us, Denman will call us out.\"\n\nThis was good sailorly logic, and they climbed back into their bunks, to\nsmoke, to read, or to talk themselves to sleep again. As the wind and\nsea arose they closed the other two deadlights, and when darkness\nclosed down they turned out the dazzling bulbs, and slept through the\nnight as only sailors can.\n\nJust before daylight Jenkins lifted his big bulk out of the bunk, and,\ntaking a key from his pocket, unlocked the forecastle door. He stepped\ninto the passage, and found the hatch loose on the coamings, then came\nback and quietly wakened them all.\n\n\"I found this key on the deck near the door first day aboard,\" he\nvolunteered; \"but put it in my pocket instead of the door.\"\n\nThey softly crept out into the passage and lifted the hatch; but it was\nthe irrepressible and most certainly courageous Forsythe who was first\nto climb up. He reached the deck just in time to dodge into the darkness\nbehind the bridge ladder at the sight of Denman coming forward to attend\nto the lamps; and it was he who sent both fists into the side of\nDenman's face with force enough to knock him senseless. Then came the\nothers.\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\"That'll do, Forsythe,\" said Sampson, interrupting the flow of\nbillingsgate. \"We'll omit prayers and flowers at this funeral. Stand\nup.\"\n\nForsythe arose, waving two bunches of keys and Denman's revolver.\n\n\"Got him foul,\" he yelled, excitedly. \"All the keys and his gun.\"\n\n\"All right. Just hand that gun to me--what! You won't?\"\n\nForsythe had backed away at the command; but Sampson sprang upon him and\neasily disarmed him.\n\n\"Now, my lad,\" he said, sternly, \"just find the key of these darbies and\nunlock us.\"\n\nForsythe, muttering, \"Got one good smash at him, anyhow,\" found the key\nof the handcuffs, and, first unlocking his own, went the rounds. Then he\nfound the key of the leg irons, and soon all were free, and the manacles\ntossed down the hatch to be gathered up later. Then big Jenkins reached\nhis hand out to Forsythe--but not in token of amnesty.\n\n\"The keys,\" he said, in his hoarse whisper.\n\n\"Aren't they safe enough with me?\" queried Forsythe, hotly.\n\nJenkins still maintained the outstretched hand, and Forsythe looked\nirresolutely around. He saw no signs of sympathy. They were all closing\nin on him, and he meekly handed the two bunches to Jenkins, who pocketed\nthem.\n\nMeanwhile, Sampson had lifted Denman to his feet; and, as the boat still\nrolled heavily, he assisted him to the bridge stairs, where he could get\na grip on the railing with his fettered hands. Daylight had come, and\nDenman could see Florrie, still seated in the deck chair, looking\nforward with frightened eyes.\n\n\"Jenkins, step here a moment,\" said Sampson; \"and you other\nfellows--keep back.\"\n\nJenkins drew near.\n\n\"Did you hear, in the fo'castle,\" Sampson went on, \"what I said about\nMr. Denman saving my life, and that I promised him parole and the\npossession of his gun in case we got charge again?\"\n\nJenkins nodded, but said: \"He broke his parole before.\"\n\n\"So would you under the same provocation. Forsythe called him a milk-fed\nthief. Wouldn't you have struck out?\"\n\nJenkins nodded again, and Sampson continued:\n\n\"All right. My proposition is to place Mr. Denman under parole once\nmore, to give him and the lady the run of the deck abaft the galley\nhatch, and to leave them both the possession of their guns for\nself-defense, in case\"--he looked humorously around at the\nothers--\"these inebriates get drunk again.\"\n\n\"But the other guns. He has them somewhere. We want power of\nself-defense, too.\"\n\n\"Mr. Denman,\" said Sampson, turning to the prisoner, \"you've heard the\nconditions. Will you tell us where the arms are, and will you keep aft\nof the galley hatch, you and the lady?\"\n\n\"I will,\" answered Denman, \"on condition that you all, and particularly\nyour navigator, keep forward of the galley hatch.\"\n\n\"We'll do that, sir; except, of course, in case of working or fighting\nship. Now, tell us where the guns are, and we'll release you.\"\n\n\"Haven't we something to say about this?\" inquired Forsythe, while a few\nothers grumbled their disapproval of the plan.\n\n\"No; you have not,\" answered Jenkins, his hoarse whisper becoming a\nvoice. \"Not a one of you. Sampson and I will be responsible for this.\"\n\n\"All right, then,\" responded Forsythe. \"But I'll carry my gun all the\ntime. I'm not going to be shot down without a white man's chance.\"\n\n\"You'll carry a gun, my son,\" said Sampson, \"when we give it to you--and\nthen it won't be to shoot Mr. Denman. It's on your account, remember,\nthat we're giving him a gun. Now, Mr. Denman, where are the pistols and\ntoothpicks?\"\n\n\"The pistols are in my room, the cutlasses in the room opposite. You\nhave the keys.\"\n\n\"Aft all hands,\" ordered Jenkins, fumbling in his pockets for the keys,\n\"and get the weapons.\"\n\nAway they trooped, and crowded down the wardroom companion, Sampson\nlifting his cap politely to the girl in the chair. In a short time they\nreappeared, each man loaded down with pistols and cutlasses. They\nplaced them in the forecastle, and when they had come up Sampson\nreleased Denman's bonds.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" he said, \"you are free. We'll keep our promises, and we\nexpect you to keep yours. Here is your gun, Mr. Denman.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sampson,\" said Denman, pocketing the revolver and shaking\nhis aching hands to circulate the blood. \"Of course, we are to keep our\npromises.\"\n\n\"Even though you see things done that will raise your hair, sir.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Denman, with sudden interest.\n\n\"Can't tell you anything, sir, except what you may know, or will know.\nThis boat is _not_ bound for the African coast. That's all, sir.\"\n\n\"Go below the watch,\" broke in Jenkins' husky voice. \"To stations, the\nrest.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\"What happened, Billie?\" asked Florrie as Denman joined her.\n\n\"Not much, Florrie,\" he replied, as cheerfully as was possible in his\nmood. \"Only a physical and practical demonstration that I am the two\nends and the bight of a fool.\"\n\n\"You are not a fool, Billie; but what happened? How did they get out?\"\n\n\"By picking the lock of the door, I suppose; or, perhaps, they had a key\ninside. That's where the fool comes in. I should have nailed the door on\nthem.\"\n\n\"And what do they mean to do?\"\n\n\"Don't know. They have some new project in mind. But we're better off\nthan before, girl. We're at liberty to carry arms, and to go and come,\nprovided we stay this side of the galley hatch. They are to let us alone\nand stay forward of the hatch. By the way,\" he added. \"In view of the\nrather indeterminate outlook, let's carry our hardware outside.\"\n\nHe removed his belt from his waist and buckled it outside his oilskin\ncoat. Then, when he had transferred the pistol from his pocket to the\nscabbard, he assisted the girl.\n\n\"There,\" he said, as he stood back and looked at her, admiringly, \"with\nall due regard for your good looks, Florrie, you resemble a cross\nbetween a cowboy and a second mate.\"\n\n\"No more so than you,\" she retorted; \"but I've lost my place as cook, I\nthink.\" She pointed at the galley chimney, from which smoke was arising.\nDenman looked, and also became interested in an excited convention\nforward.\n\nThough Jenkins had sent the watch below and the rest to stations, only\nthe two cooks had obeyed. The others, with the boat still rolling in the\nheavy sea, had surrounded Jenkins, and seemed to be arguing with him.\nThe big man, saving his voice, answered only by signs as yet; but the\nvoices of the others soon became audible to the two aft.\n\n\"I tell you it's all worked out, Jenkins--all figured out while you were\ndopy in your bunk.\"\n\nJenkins shook his head.\n\nThen followed an excited burst of reason and flow of words from which\nDenman could only gather a few disjointed phrases: \"Dead easy,\nJenkins--Run close and land--Casey's brother--Can hoof it to--Might get\na job, which'd be better--Got a private code made up--Don't need\nmoney--Can beat his way in--My brother has a wireless--Take the dinghy;\nwe don't need it--I'll take the chance if you have a life-buoy\nhandy--Chance of a lifetime--Who wants beach combing in Africa--You see,\nhe'll watch the financial news--I'll stow away in her--I tell you,\nJenkins, there'll be no killing. I've made my mind up to that, and will\nsee to it.\"\n\nThe last speech was from Sampson; and, on hearing it, Jenkins waved them\nall away. Then he used his voice.\n\n\"Get to stations,\" he said. \"I'll think it out. Forsythe, take the\nbridge and dope out where we are.\"\n\nThey scattered, and Forsythe mounted to the bridge, while Jenkins, still\na sick man, descended to the forecastle.\n\n\"What does it all mean, Billie?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Haven't the slightest idea,\" answered Denman, as he seated himself\nbeside her. \"They've been hinting at big things; and Sampson said that\nthey might raise my hair. However, we'll know soon. The wind is going\ndown. This was the outer fringe of a cyclone.\"\n\n\"Why don't they go ahead?\"\n\n\"Too much sea. These boats are made for speed, not strength. You can\nbreak their backs by steaming into a head sea.\"\n\nDaniels, the cook, came on deck and aft to the limits of the hatch,\nindicating by his face and manner that he wished to speak to Denman.\n\nDenman arose and approached him.\n\n\"Will you and the lady eat breakfast together, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"I believe so,\" answered Denman. Then, turning to Florrie: \"How will it\nbe? May I eat breakfast with you this morning?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Then, sir,\" said Daniels, \"I'll have to serve it in the after cabin.\"\n\n\"Why not the wardroom? Why not keep out of Miss Fleming's apartment?\"\n\n\"Because, Mr. Denman, our work is laid out. Billings attends to the\nwardroom, and swears he won't serve this lady, or get within reach of\nher.\"\n\n\"Serve it in the after cabin, then,\" said Denman, turning away to hide\nthe coming smile, and Daniels departed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNot caring to agitate the girl with an account of Billings' drunken\novertures and his own vicarious repulse of them, he did not explain to\nher Billings' trouble of mind; but he found trouble of his own in\nexplaining his frequent bursts of laughter while they ate their\nbreakfast in the cabin. And Florrie found trouble in accepting his\nexplanations, for they were irrelevant, incompetent, and inane.\n\nAfter breakfast they went on deck without oilskins, for wind and sea\nwere going down. There was a dry deck; and above, a sky which, still\ngray with the background of storm cloud, yet showed an occasional\nglimmer of blue, while to the east the sun shone clear and unobstructed;\nbut on the whole clean-cut horizon there was not a sign of sail or\nsmoke.\n\nEight bells having struck, the watches were changed; but except possibly\na man in the engine room getting up steam--for smoke was pouring out of\nthe four funnels--no one was at stations. The watch on deck was\nscattered about forward; and Forsythe had given way to Jenkins, who,\nwith his eye fixed to a long telescope, was scanning the horizon from\nthe bridge.\n\nDenman, for over forty-eight hours without sleep, would have turned in\nhad not curiosity kept him awake. So he waited until nine o'clock, when\nForsythe, with Munson's help, took morning sights, and later until ten,\nwhen Forsythe handed Jenkins a slip of paper on which presumably he had\njotted the boat's approximate position. Immediately Jenkins rang the\nengine bells, and the boat forged ahead.\n\nDenman watched her swing to a starboard wheel; and, when the rolling\ngave way to a pitching motion as she met the head sea, he glanced at the\nafter binnacle compass.\n\n\"Northwest by north, half north,\" he said. \"Whatever their plan is,\nJenkins has been won over. Florrie, better turn in. I'm going to. Lock\nyour door and keep that gun handy.\"\n\nBut they were not menaced--not even roused for dinner; for Daniels had\ngone below, and Billings, on watch for the morning, could not wake\nDenman, and would not approach Miss Florrie's door. So it was late in\nthe afternoon when they again appeared on deck.\n\nThe weather had cleared, the sea was smoothing, and the boat surging\nalong under the cruising turbines; while Hawkes had the wheel, and\nForsythe, still in officer's uniform, paced back and forth.\n\nEvidently Jenkins, in the light of his physical and mental limitations,\nhad seen the need of an assistant. Old Kelly, the gunner's mate, was\nfussing around a twelve-pounder; the rest were out of sight.\n\nDenman concluded that some kind of sea discipline had been established\nwhile he slept, and that Kelly had been put in charge of the gunnery\ndepartment and been relieved from standing watch; otherwise, by the\nformer arrangement, Kelly would have been below while Forsythe and\nHawkes were on deck.\n\nThe horizon was dotted with specks, some showing smoke, others, under\nthe glass, showing canvas. Denman examined each by the captain's\nbinoculars, but saw no signs of a government craft--all were peaceably\ngoing their way.\n\n\"Why is it,\" asked Florrie, as she took the glass from Denman, \"that we\nsee so many vessels now, when we lay for days without seeing any?\"\n\n\"We were in a pocket, I suppose,\" answered Denman. \"Lane routes, trade\nroutes, for high and low-powered craft, as well as for sailing craft,\nare so well established these days that, if you get between them, you\ncan wait for weeks without seeing anything.\"\n\n\"Do you think there is any chance of our being rescued soon?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Florrie; though we can't go much nearer the coast without\nbeing recognized. In fact, I haven't thought much about it lately--the\ntruth is, I'm getting interested in these fellows. This is the most\ndaring and desperate game I ever saw played, and how they'll come out is\na puzzle. Hello! Eight bells.\"\n\nThe bell was struck on the bridge, and the watches changed, except that\nJenkins, after a short talk with Forsythe, did not relieve him, but came\naft to the engine-room hatch, where he held another short talk with\nSampson and Riley, who, instead of going below, had waited.\n\nOnly a few words came to Denman's ears, and these in the hoarse accents\nof Jenkins as he left them: \"Six days at cruising speed, you say, and\ntwo at full steam? All right.\"\n\nJenkins continued aft, but halted and called the retreating Sampson, who\njoined him; then the two approached the galley hatch and hailed Denman.\n\n\"Captain Jenkins can't talk very well, sir,\" said Sampson, with a\nconciliatory grin; \"but he wants me to ask you what you did to him. He\nsays he bears no grudge.\"\n\n\"Can't tell you,\" answered Denman, promptly. \"It is a trick of Japanese\njujutsu, not taught in the schools, and known only to experts. I\nlearned it in Japan when my life was in danger.\"\n\nJenkins nodded, as though satisfied with the explanation, and Sampson\nresumed:\n\n\"Another thing we came aft for, Mr. Denman, is to notify you that we\nmust search the skipper's room and the wardroom for whatever money there\nis on board. There may be none, but we want the last cent.\"\n\n\"What on earth,\" exclaimed Denman, \"do you want with money?\" Then, as\ntheir faces clouded, he added: \"Oh, go ahead. Don't turn my room\nupside-down. You'll find my pile in a suit of citizen's clothes hanging\nup. About four and a half.\"\n\n\"Four and a half is a whole lot, sir,\" remarked Sampson as they\ndescended the wardroom hatch.\n\n\"Got any money down below, Florrie?\" inquired Denman, joining the girl.\n\nShe shook her head. \"No. I lost everything but what I wear.\"\n\nThe tears that started to her eyes apprised Denman that hers was more\nthan a money loss; but there is no comfort of mere words for such loss,\nand he went on quickly:\n\n\"They are going through the cabin for money. They'll get all I've got.\nDid you see any cash in the captain's desk?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, Billie,\" she said, hesitatingly. \"I wanted a place to put my\ncombs when I wore the bandage, and I saw some money in the upper desk.\nIt was a roll.\"\n\n\"He's lost it, then. Always was a careless man. Did you count it?\"\n\n\"No. I had no right to.\"\n\nBut the question in Denman's mind was answered by Sampson when he and\nJenkins emerged from the hatch. \"Five hundred,\" he said. \"Fine! He\nwon't need a quarter of it, Jenkins.\"\n\n\"Five hundred!\" repeated Denman to the girl. \"Jail-breaking, stealing\ngovernment property, mutiny--against me--piracy, and burglary. Heaven\nhelp them when they are caught!\"\n\n\"But will they be?\"\n\n\"Can't help but be caught. I know nothing of their plans; but I do know\nthat they are running right into a hornet's nest. If a single one of\nthose craft on the horizon recognizes this boat and can wireless the\nnearest station, we'll be surrounded to-morrow.\"\n\nBut, as it happened, they were not recognized, though they took\ndesperate chances in charging through a coasting fleet in daylight. And\nat nightfall Jenkins gave the order for full speed.\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nFor an hour Denman remained with Florrie to witness the unusual\nspectacle of a forty-knot destroyer in a hurry.\n\nThe wind was practically gone, though a heavy ground swell still met the\nboat from the northwest; and as there was no moon, nor starlight, and as\nall lights were out but the white masthead and red and green side\nlights, invisible from aft, but dimly lighting the sea ahead, the sight\npresented was unusual and awe-inspiring.\n\nThey seemed to be looking at an ever-receding wall of solid blackness,\nbeneath which rose and spread from the high bow, to starboard and port,\ntwo huge, moving snowdrifts, lessening in size as the bow lifted over\nthe crest of a sea it had climbed, and increasing to a liquid avalanche\nof foam that sent spangles up into the bright illumination of the\nmasthead light when the prow buried itself in the base of the next sea.\n\nAstern was a white, self-luminous wake that narrowed to a point in the\ndistance before it had lost its phosphorescent glow.\n\nFlorrie was interested only in the glorious picture as a whole. Denman,\nequally impressed, was interested in the somewhat rare spectacle of a\ncraft meeting at forty knots a sea running at twenty; for not a drop of\nwater hit the deck where they stood.\n\nThey went below at last; but Denman, having slept nearly all day, was\nlong in getting to sleep. A curious, futile, and inconsequential thought\nbothered him--the thought that the cheerful Billings had ceased his\nsinging in the galley.\n\nThe monotonous humming of the turbines brought sleep at last; but he\nawakened at daylight from a dream in which Billings, dressed in a Mother\nHubbard and a poke bonnet, was trying to force a piece of salt-water\nsoap into his mouth, and had almost succeeded when he awoke. But it was\nthe stopping of the turbines that really had wakened him; and he dressed\nhurriedly and went on deck.\n\nThere was nothing amiss. No one was in sight but Jenkins, who leaned\nlazily against the bridge rail. In the dim light that shone, nothing\ncould be seen on the horizon or within it.\n\nSo, a little ashamed of his uncalled-for curiosity, he hurried down and\nturned in, \"all standing,\" to wait for breakfast and an explanation.\n\nBut no explanation was given him, either by events or the attitude of\nthe men. Those on deck avoided the after end of the boat--all except old\nKelly, whose duties brought him finally to the after guns and tubes;\nbut, while civilly lifting his cap to Miss Florrie, he was grouchy and\ntaciturn in his manner until his work was done, then he halted at the\ngalley hatch on his way forward to lean over and pronounce anathema on\nthe heads of the cooks because of the quality of the food.\n\nWhile waiting for breakfast, Denman had listened to an angry and wordy\nargument between the two cooks, in which Daniels had voiced his opinion\nof Billings for waking him from his watch below to serve the prisoners.\n\nWhen the watches were changed at eight bells that morning, he had heard\nHawkes and Davis, the two seamen of the deck department, protesting\nviolently to Jenkins at the promotion of Forsythe and Kelly, which left\nthem to do all the steering.\n\nJenkins had not answered orally, but his gestures overruled the protest.\nEven Casey and Munson argued almost to quarreling over various \"tricks\nof their trade,\" which Denman, as he listened, could only surmise were\nto form a part of the private code they had spoken of when haranguing\nJenkins.\n\nThere was a nervous unrest pervading them all which, while leaving\nFlorrie and Denman intact, even reached the engine room.\n\nAt noon Sampson and Dwyer were relieved, and the former turned back to\nshout down the hatch:\n\n\"I told you to do it, and that goes. We've over-hauled and cleaned it.\nYou two assemble and oil it up this afternoon, or you'll hear from me at\neight bells.\"\n\nThe voice of Riley--who was nearly as large a man as Sampson--answered\nhotly but inarticulately, and Denman could only ascribe the row to a\ndifference of opinion concerning the condition of some part of the\nengines.\n\nSampson, though possibly a lesser engineer than the others of his\ndepartment, yet dominated them as Jenkins dominated them all--by pure\nforce of personality. He had made himself chief engineer, and his\norders were obeyed, as evidenced by the tranquil silence that emanated\nfrom the engine room when Sampson returned at four in the afternoon.\n\nAll day the boat lay with quiet engines and a bare head of steam,\nrolling slightly in a swell that now came from the east, while the sun\nshone brightly overhead from east to west, and only a few specks\nappeared on the horizon, to remain for a time, and vanish.\n\nMeanwhile Florrie worried Denman with questions that he could not\nanswer.\n\n\"Forsythe took sights in the morning,\" he explained at length, \"and a\nmeridian observation at noon. He has undoubtedly found another 'pocket,'\nas I call these triangular spaces between the routes; but I do not know\nwhere we are, except that, computing our yesterday and last night's run,\nwe are within from sixty to a hundred miles of New York.\"\n\nHe was further mystified when, on going into his room for a cigar after\nsupper, he found his suit of \"citizen's clothes\" missing from its hook.\n\n\"Not the same thief,\" he grumbled. \"Sampson and Jenkins are too big for\nit.\"\n\nHe did not mention his loss to Florrie, not wishing to arouse further\nfeminine speculation; and when, at a later hour in this higher latitude,\ndarkness had come, and full speed was rung to the engine room, he\ninduced her to retire.\n\n\"I don't know what's up,\" he said; \"but--get all the sleep you can. I'll\ncall you if anything happens.\"\n\nHe did not go to sleep himself, but smoked and waited while the humming\nturbines gathered in the miles--one hour, two hours, nearly three--until\na quarter to eleven o'clock, when speed was reduced.\n\nRemembering his embarrassment of the morning, Denman did not seek the\ndeck, but looked through his deadlight. Nothing but darkness met his\neye; it was a black night with rain.\n\nHe entered the lighted wardroom and looked at the telltale above; it\ntold him that the boat was heading due north. Then he entered an\nopposite room--all were unlocked now--from which, slantingly through the\ndeadlight, he saw lights. He threw open the thick, round window, and saw\nmore clearly. Lights, shore lights, ahead and to port.\n\nHe saw no land; but from the perspective of the lights he judged that\nthey ran east and west. Then he heard the call of the lead: \"A quarter\nseventeen;\" and a little later: \"By the deep seventeen,\" delivered in a\nsing-song voice by Hawkes.\n\n\"The coast of Long Island,\" muttered Denman. \"Well, for picked-up,\nschool-book navigation, it is certainly a feat--to run over six hundred\nmiles and stop over soundings.\"\n\nThe boat went on at reduced speed until Hawkes had called out: \"By the\nmark ten,\" when the engines stopped, and there was a rush of footsteps\non deck, that centered over the open deadlight, above which was slung to\nthe davits the boat called by them the dinghy, but which was only a very\nsmall gasoline launch.\n\n\"In with you, Casey,\" said Jenkins, in his low, hoarse voice, \"and turn\nher over. See about the bottom plug, too. Clear away those guys fore and\naft, you fellows.\"\n\nIn a few moments came the buzzing of the small engine; then it stopped,\nand Casey said: \"Engine's all right, and--so is the plug. Shove out and\nlower away.\"\n\n\"Got everything right, Casey? Got your money? Got the code?\"\n\n\"Got everything,\" was the impatient answer.\n\n\"Well, remember--you're to head the boat out from the beach, pull the\nbottom plug, and let her sink in deep water. Make sure your wheel's\namidships.\"\n\n\"Shove out and lower away,\" retorted Casey. \"D'you think I never learned\nto run a naphtha launch?\"\n\nDenman heard the creaking sound of the davits turning in their beds,\nthen the slackening away of the falls, their unhooking by Casey, and the\nchugging of the engine as the launch drew away.\n\n\"Good luck, Casey!\" called Jenkins.\n\n\"All right!\" answered Casey from the distance. \"Have your life-buoys\nhandy.\"\n\nDenman had ducked out of sight as the launch was lowered, and he did not\nsee Casey; but, on opening a locker in his room for a fresh box of\ncigars, he noticed that his laundry had been tampered with. Six shirts\nand twice as many collars were gone. On looking further, he missed a new\nderby hat that he had prized more than usual, also his suitcase.\n\n\"Casey and I are about the same size,\" he muttered. \"But what the deuce\ndoes it all mean?\"\n\nHe went to sleep with the turbines humming full speed in his ears; but\nhe wakened when they were reduced to cruising speed. Looking at his\nwatch in the light from the wardroom, he found that it was half-past\ntwo; and, on stepping out for a look at the telltale, he found the boat\nheading due south.\n\n\"Back in the pocket,\" he said, as he returned to his room.\n\nBut the engines did not stop, as he partly expected; they remained at\nhalf speed, and the boat still headed south when he wakened at\nbreakfast-time.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nAfter breakfast, King, one of the machinists, and a pleasant-faced young\nman, came aft with an ensign, a hammer, chisel, and paint pot.\n\n\"This is work, sir,\" he said, as he passed, tipping his cap politely to\nMiss Florrie. \"Should have been done before.\"\n\nHe went to the taffrail, and, leaning over with the hammer and chisel,\nremoved the raised letters that spelled the boat's name. Then he covered\nthe hiatus with paint, and hoisted the ensign to the flagstaff.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" he remarked, as he gathered up his tools and paint pot,\n\"she's a government craft again.\"\n\n\"I see,\" commented Denman; and then to Florrie as King went forward:\n\"They're getting foxy. We're steaming into the crowd again, and they\nwant to forestall inspection and suspicion. I wonder if our being\nallowed on deck is part of the plan? A lady and an officer aft look\nlegitimate.\"\n\nAt noon every man was dressed to the regulations, in clean blue, with\nneckerchief and knife lanyard, while Jenkins and Forsythe appeared in\nfull undress uniform, with tasteful linen and neckwear.\n\nThat this was part of the plan was proven when, after a display of\nbunting in the International Signal Code from the yard up forward, they\nranged alongside of an outbound tank steamer that had kindly slowed down\nfor them.\n\nAll hands but one cook and one engineer had mustered on deck,\nshowing a fair semblance of a full-powered watch; and the one\ncook--Billings--displayed himself above the hatch for one brief\nmoment, clad in a spotless white jacket.\n\nThen, just before the two bridges came together, Jenkins hurried down\nthe steps and aft to Denman to speak a few words, then hasten forward.\nIt was sufficiently theatrical to impress the skipper of the tanker, but\nwhat Jenkins really said to Denman was: \"You are to remember your\nparole, sir, and not hail that steamer.\"\n\nTo which Denman had nodded assent.\n\n\"Steamer ahoy!\" shouted Forsythe, through a small megaphone. \"You are\nladen with oil, as you said by signal. We would like to replenish our\nsupply, which is almost exhausted.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the skipper; \"but to whom shall I send the bill?\"\n\n\"To the superintendent of the Charlestown Navy Yard. It will very likely\nbe paid to your owners before you get back. We want as much as a hundred\ntons. I have made out a receipt for that amount. Throw us a heaving line\nto take our hose, and I will send it up on the bight.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir. Anything else I can do for you, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes; we want about two hundred gallons of water. Been out a long time.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir--very glad to accommodate you. Been after that runaway\ntorpedo boat?\"\n\n\"Yes; any news of her on shore? Our wireless is out of order.\"\n\n\"Well, the opinion is that she was lost in the big blow a few days ago.\nShe was reported well to the nor'ard; and it was a St. Lawrence Valley\nstorm. Did you get any of it?\"\n\n\"Very little,\" answered Forsythe. \"We were well to the s'uth'ard.\"\n\n\"A slight stumble in good diction there, Mr. Forsythe,\" muttered the\nlistening Denman. \"Otherwise, very well carried out.\"\n\nBut the deluded tank skipper made no strictures on Forsythe's diction;\nand, while the pleasant conversation was going on, the two lines of hose\nwere passed, and the receipt for oil and water sent up to the steamer.\n\nIn a short time the tanks were filled, the hose hauled back, and the\nstarting bells run in both engine rooms.\n\nThe destroyer was first to gather way; and, as her stern drew abreast of\nthe tanker's bridge, the skipper lifted his cap to Florrie and Denman,\nand called out: \"Good afternoon, captain, I'm very glad that I was able\nto accommodate you.\"\n\nTo which Denman, with all hands looking expectantly at him, only replied\nwith a bow--as became a dignified commander with two well-trained\nofficers on his bridge to attend to the work.\n\nThe boat circled around, headed northwest, and went on at full speed\nuntil, not only the tanker, but every other craft in view, had sunk\nbeneath the horizon. Then the engines were stopped, and the signal yard\nsent down.\n\n\"Back in the pocket again,\" said Denman to Florrie. \"What on earth can\nthey be driving at?\"\n\n\"And why,\" she answered, with another query, \"did they go to all that\ntrouble to be so polite and nice, when, as you say, they are fully\ncommitted to piracy, and robbed the other vessels by force?\"\n\n\"This seems to show,\" he said, \"the master hand of Jenkins, who is a\nnatural-born gentleman, as against the work of Forsythe, who is a\nnatural-born brute.\"\n\n\"Yet he is a high-school graduate.\"\n\n\"And Jenkins is a passed seaman apprentice.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"One who enters the navy at about fifteen or sixteen to serve until he\nis twenty-one, then to leave the navy or re\u00c3\u00abnlist. They seldom re\u00c3\u00abnlist,\nfor they are trained, tutored, and disciplined into good workmen, to\nwhom shore life offers better opportunities. Those who do re\u00c3\u00abnlist have\nraised the standard of the navy sailor to the highest in the world; but\nthose that don't are a sad loss to the navy. Jenkins re\u00c3\u00abnlisted. So did\nForsythe.\"\n\n\"But do you think the training and tutoring that Jenkins received equal\nto an education like Forsythe's--or yours?\"\n\n\"They learn more facts,\" answered Denman. \"The training makes a man of a\nbad boy, and a gentleman of a good one. What a ghastly pity that,\nbecause of conservatism and politics, all this splendid material for\nofficers should go to waste, and the appointments to Annapolis be given\nto good high-school scholars, who might be cowardly sissies at heart, or\nblackguards like Forsythe!\"\n\n\"But that is how you received your appointment, Billie Denman,\" said the\ngirl, warmly; \"and you are neither a sissy nor a blackguard.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" he answered, grimly. \"Yet, if I had first served my time\nas seaman apprentice before being appointed to Annapolis, I might be up\non that bridge now, instead of standing supinely by while one seaman\napprentice does the navigating and another the bossing.\"\n\n\"There is that man again. I'm afraid of him, Billie. All the others,\nexcept Forsythe, have been civil to me; but he looks at me--so--so\nhatefully.\"\n\nBillings, minus his clean white jacket, had come up the hatch and gone\nforward. He came back soon, showing a sullen, scowling face, as though\nhis cheerful disposition had entirely left him.\n\nAs he reached the galley hatch, he cast upon the girl a look of such\nintense hatred and malevolence that Denman, white with anger, sprang to\nthe hatch, and halted him.\n\n\"If ever again,\" he said, explosively, \"I catch you glaring at this lady\nin that manner, parole or no parole, I'll throw you overboard.\"\n\nBillings' face straightened; he saluted, and, without a word, went down\nthe hatch, while Denman returned to the girl.\n\n\"He is an enlisted man,\" he said, bitterly, \"not a passed seaman\napprentice; so I downed him easily with a few words.\"\n\nAnd then came the thought, which he did not express to Florrie, that his\nfancied limitations, which prevented him from being on the bridge, also\nprevented him from enlightening the morbid Billings as to the real\nsource of the \"terrible punch\" he had received; for, while he could\njustify his silence to Florrie, he could only, with regard to Billings,\nfeel a masculine dread of ridicule at dressing in feminine clothing.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nAt supper that evening they were served with prunes, bread without\nbutter, and weak tea, with neither milk nor sugar.\n\n\"Orders from for'a'd, sir,\" said Daniels, noticing Denman's involuntary\nlook of surprise. \"All hands are to be on short allowance for a\nwhile--until something comes our way again.\"\n\n\"But why,\" asked Denman, \"do you men include us in your plans and\neconomies? Why did you not rid yourself of us last night, when you sent\none of your number ashore?\"\n\nDaniels was a tall, somber-faced man--a typical ship's cook--and he\nanswered slowly: \"I cannot tell you, sir. Except that both you and the\nlady might talk about this boat.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Denman, \"I was speaking for this lady, who doesn't\nbelong with us. My place is right here.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" agreed Daniels; \"but I am at liberty to say, sir, to you and\nthe lady, that you'd best look out for Billings. He seems to be goin'\nbatty. I heard him talking to himself, threatening harm to this lady. I\ndon't know what he's got against her myself--\"\n\n\"Tell him,\" said Denman, sharply, \"that if he enters this apartment, or\nsteps one foot abaft the galley hatch on deck, the parole is broken, and\nI'll put a bullet through his head. You might tell that to Jenkins,\ntoo.\"\n\nDaniels got through the wardroom door before answering: \"I'll not do\nthat, sir. Jenkins might confine him, and leave all the work to me. But\nI think Billings needs a licking.\"\n\nWhether Daniels applied this treatment for the insane to Billings, or\nwhether Billings, with an equal right to adjudge Daniels insane, had\napplied the same treatment to him, could not be determined without\nviolation of the parole; but when they had finished supper and reached\nthe deck, sounds of conflict came up from the galley hatch, unheard and\nuninterrupted by those forward. It was a series of thumps, oaths,\ngrowlings, and the rattling of pots and pans on the galley floor. Then\nthere was silence.\n\n\"You see,\" said Denman to Florrie, with mock seriousness, \"the baleful\ninfluence of a woman aboard ship! It never fails.\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" she said, with a pout and a blush--her blushes were\ndiscernible now, for the last vestige of the scalding had gone--\"but I\nmean to wear a veil from this on. I had one in my pocket.\"\n\n\"I think that would be wise,\" answered Denman, gravely. \"These men\nare--\"\n\n\"You see, Billie,\" she interrupted. \"I've got a new complexion--brand\nnew; peaches and cream for the first time in my life, and I'm going to\ntake care of it.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" he said, with a laugh. \"But I'll wager you won't patent\nthe process. Live steam is rather severe as a beautifier!\"\n\nBut she kept her word. After the meager breakfast next morning--which\nDaniels served with no explanation of the row--she appeared on deck with\nher face hidden, and from then on wore the veil.\n\nThere was a new activity among the men--a partial relief from the\nall-pervading nervousness and irritability. Gun and torpedo\npractice--which brought to drill every man on board except Munson,\nburied in his wireless room, and one engineer on duty--was inaugurated\nand continued through the day.\n\nTheir natty blue uniforms discarded, they toiled and perspired at the\ntask; and when, toward the end of the afternoon, old Kelly decided that\nthey could be depended upon to fire a gun or eject a torpedo, Jenkins\ndecreed that they should get on deck and lash to the rail in their\nchocks four extra torpedoes.\n\nAs there was one in each tube, this made eight of the deadliest weapons\nof warfare ready at hand; and when the task was done they quit for the\nday, the deck force going to the bridge for a look around the empty\nhorizon, the cooks to the galley, and the machinists to the engine room.\n\nDenman, who with doubt and misgiving had watched the day's preparations,\nled Florrie down the companion.\n\n\"They're getting ready for a mix of some kind; and there must be some\nplace to put you away from gun fire. How's this?\"\n\nHe opened a small hatch covered by the loose after edge of the cabin\ncarpet, and disclosed a compartment below which might have been designed\nfor stores, but which contained nothing, as a lighted electric bulb\nshowed him. Coming up, he threw a couple of blankets down, and said:\n\n\"There's a cyclone cellar for you, Florrie, below the water line. If\nwe're fired upon jump down, and don't come up until called, or until\nwater comes in.\"\n\nThen he went to his room for the extra store of cartridges he had\nsecreted, but found them gone. Angrily returning to Florrie, he asked\nfor her supply; and she, too, searched, and found nothing. But both\ntheir weapons were fully loaded.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, philosophically, as they returned to the deck, \"they\nonly guaranteed us the privilege of carrying arms. I suppose they feel\njustified from their standpoint.\"\n\nBut on deck they found something to take their minds temporarily off the\nloss. Sampson, red in the face, was vociferating down the engine-room\nhatch.\n\n\"Come up here,\" he said, loudly and defiantly. \"Come up here and prove\nit, if you think you're a better man than I am. Come up and square\nyourself, you flannel-mouthed mick.\"\n\nThe \"flannel-mouthed mick,\" in the person of Riley, white of face rather\nthan red, but with eyes blazing and mouth set in an ugly grin, climbed\nup.\n\nIt was a short fight--the blows delivered by Sampson, the parrying done\nby Riley--and ended with a crashing swing on Riley's jaw that sent him\nto the deck, not to rise for a few moments.\n\n\"Had enough?\" asked Sampson, triumphantly. \"Had enough, you imitation of\nan ash cat? Oh, I guess you have. Think it out.\"\n\nHe turned and met Jenkins, who had run aft from the bridge.\n\n\"Now, Sampson, this'll be enough of this.\"\n\n\"What have _you_ got to say about it?\" inquired Sampson, irately.\n\n\"Plenty to say,\" answered Jenkins, calmly.\n\n\"Not much, you haven't. You keep away from the engine room and the\nengine-room affairs. I can 'tend to my department. You 'tend to yours.\"\n\n\"I can attend to yours as well when the time comes. There's work ahead\nfor--\"\n\n\"Well, attend to me now. You've sweated me all day like a stoker at your\nwork; now go on and finish it up. I'll take a fall out o' you, Jenkins,\nright here.\"\n\n\"No, you won't! Wait until the work's done, and I'll accommodate you.\"\n\nJenkins went forward; and Sampson, after a few moments of scarcely\naudible grumbling, followed to the forecastle. Then Riley got up, looked\nafter him, and shook his fist.\n\n\"I'll git even wi' you for this,\" he declared, with lurid profanity.\n\"I'll have yer life for this, Sampson.\"\n\nThen he went down the hatch, while Forsythe on the bridge, who had\nwatched the whole affair with an evil grin, turned away from Jenkins\nwhen the latter joined him. Perhaps he enjoyed the sight of some one\nbeside himself being knocked down.\n\n\"It looks rather bad, Florrie,\" said Denman, dubiously; \"all this\nquarreling among themselves. Whatever job they have on hand they must\nhold together, or we'll get the worst of it. I don't like to see Jenkins\nand Sampson at it, though the two cooks are only a joke.\"\n\nBut there was no more open quarreling for the present. As the days wore\non, a little gun and torpedo drill was carried out; while, with steam\nup, the boat made occasional darts to the north or south to avoid too\nclose contact with passing craft, and gradually--by fits and\nstarts--crept more to the westward. And Jenkins recovered complete\ncontrol of his voice and movements, while Munson, the wireless man,\ngrew haggard and thin.\n\nAt last, at nine o'clock one evening, just before Denman went down,\nMunson ran up with a sheet of paper, shouting to the bridge:\n\n\"Caught on--with the United--night shift.\"\n\nThen, having delivered the sheet to Jenkins, he went back, and the\nrasping sound of his sending instrument kept up through the night.\n\nBut when Denman sought the deck after breakfast, it had stopped; and he\nsaw Munson, still haggard of face, talking to Jenkins at the hatch.\n\n\"Got his wave length now,\" Denman heard him say. \"Took all night, but\nthat and the code'll fool 'em all.\"\n\nFrom then on Munson stood watch at his instrument only from six in the\nevening until midnight, got more sleep thereby, and soon the tired,\nhaggard look left his face, and it resumed its normal expression of\nintelligence and cheerfulness.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nAfter supper about a week later, Denman and Florrie sat in the deck\nchairs, watching the twilight give way to the gloom of the evening, and\nspeculating in a desultory manner on the end of this never-ending\nvoyage, when Munson again darted on deck, and ran up the bridge stairs\nwith a sheet of paper, barely discernible in the gathering darkness, and\nhanded it to Jenkins, who peered over it in the glow from the binnacle.\n\nThen Jenkins blew on a boatswain's whistle--the shrill, trilling, and\npenetrating call that rouses all hands in the morning, but is seldom\ngiven again throughout the day except in emergencies.\n\nAll hands responded. Both cooks rushed up from the galley, the engineers\non watch shut off all burners and appeared, and men tumbled up from the\nforecastle, all joining Jenkins and Munson on the bridge.\n\nDenman strained his ears, but could hear nothing, though he saw each man\nbending over the paper in turn.\n\nThen they quickly went back to their places below or on deck; and, as\nthe bells were given to the engine room, the rasping of the wireless\ncould be heard.\n\nAs the two cooks came aft, Denman heard them discussing excitedly but\ninaudibly the matter in hand; and, his curiosity getting the better of\nhis pride, he waited only long enough to see the boat steadied at\neast-northeast, then went down and forward to the door leading into the\npassage that led to the galley.\n\nBillings was doing most of the talking, in a high-pitched, querulous\ntone, and Daniels answered only by grunts and low-pitched monosyllables.\n\n\"_Gigantia_--ten to-morrow--five million,\" were a few of the words and\nphrases Denman caught; and at last he heard the concluding words of the\ntalk.\n\n\"Dry up,\" said Daniels, loudly and threateningly. \"Yes, thirteen is an\nunlucky number; but, if you don't shut up and clear off these dishes,\nI'll make our number twelve. Glad you've got something to think about\nbesides that woman, but--shut up. You make me tired.\"\n\nDenman went back to Florrie somewhat worried, but no longer puzzled; yet\nhe gave the girl none of his thoughts that evening--he waited until\nmorning, when, after a look around a bright horizon dotted with sail and\nsteam, he said to her as she came up:\n\n\"Eat all the breakfast you can this morning, Florrie, for it may be some\ntime before we'll eat again.\"\n\n\"Why, Billie, what is the matter?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"We've traveled at cruising speed all night,\" he answered, \"and now must\nbe up close to the 'corner,' as they call the position where the\noutbound liners change to the great circle course.\"\n\n\"Well?\" she said, inquiringly.\n\n\"Did you ever hear of the _Gigantia_?\"\n\n\"Why, of course--you mean the new liner?\"\n\n\"Yes; the latest and largest steamship built. She was on her maiden\npassage when this boat left port, and is about due to start east again.\nFlorrie, she carries five million in bullion, and these fellows mean to\nhold her up.\"\n\n\"Goodness!\" exclaimed the girl. \"You mean that they will rob her--a big\nsteamship?\"\n\n\"She's big enough, of course, to tuck this boat down a hatchway; but\nthese passenger boats carry no guns except for saluting, while this boat\ncould sink her with the armament she carries. Look at those\ntorpedoes--eight altogether, and more below decks. Eight compartments\ncould be flooded, and bulkheads are not reliable. But will they dare?\nDesperate though they are, will they dare fire on a ship full of\npassengers?\"\n\n\"How did you learn this, Billie? It seems impossible--incredible.\"\n\n\"Remember the gun and torpedo drill!\" said Denman, softly, yet\nexcitedly. \"Our being in these latitudes is significant. They put Casey\nashore the other night and robbed the captain and me to outfit him. I\noverheard some of the talk. He has reached New York, secured a position\nas night operator in a wireless station, studied the financial news, and\nsent word last night that the _Gigantia_ sails at ten this morning with\nfive million in gold.\"\n\n\"And where do you think she is now?\" asked the girl, glancing around the\nhorizon.\n\n\"At her dock in New York. She'll be out here late in the afternoon, I\nthink. But, heavens, what chances!--to wait all day, while any craft\nthat comes along may recognize this boat and notify the nearest station!\nWhy didn't they intercept the lane route out at sea, where there is no\ncrowd like this? I can only account for it by the shortage of stores.\nYes; that's it. No sane pirate would take such risks. We've plenty of\noil and water, but little food.\"\n\nThat Denman had guessed rightly was partly indicated by the action of\nthe men and the boat that day.\n\nAll hands kept the deck, and their first task was to discard the now\nuseless signal mast, which might help identify the boat as the runaway\ndestroyer.\n\nTwo engineers sawed nearly through the mast at its base, while the\nothers cleared away the light shrouds and forestay. Then a few tugs on\nthe lee shroud sent it overboard, while the men dodged from under.\nBeyond smashing the bridge rail it did no damage.\n\nThe dodging tactics were resumed. A steamer appearing on the east or\nwest horizon, heading so as to pass to the northward or southward, was\ngiven a wider berth by a dash at full speed in the opposite direction.\n\nEvery face--even Florrie's and Denman's--wore an anxious, nervous\nexpression, and the tension increased as the hours went by.\n\nDinner was served, but brought no relief. Men spoke sharply to one\nanother; and Jenkins roared his orders from the bridge, bringing a\nculmination to the strain that no one could have foreseen.\n\nThe sudden appearance of an inbound steamer out of a haze that had\narisen to the east necessitated immediate full speed. Riley was in\ncharge of the engine room, but Sampson stood at the hatch exercising an\nunofficial supervision; and it was he that received Jenkins' thundering\nrequest for more steam.\n\nSampson, in a voice equally loud, and with more profanity, admonished\nJenkins to descend to the lower regions and attend to his own affairs.\n\nJenkins yielded. Leaving Forsythe in charge of the bridge, he came down\nthe stairs and aft on the run. Not a word was spoken by either; but,\nwith the prescience that men feel at the coming of a fight, the two\ncooks left their dishes and the engineers their engines to crowd their\nheads into the hatches. Riley showed his disfigured face over the heads\nof the other two; and on the bridge Forsythe watched with the same evil\ngrin.\n\nBut few blows were passed, then the giants locked, and, twisting and\nwrithing, whirled about the deck. Florrie screamed, but Denman silenced\nher.\n\n\"Nothing can be done,\" he said, \"without violating the parole; and even\nif--\"\n\nHe stopped, for the two huge forms, tightly embraced, had reeled like\none solid object to the rail, which, catching them at just above the\nknees, had sent them overboard, exactly as Sampson had gone before.\n\n\"Man overboard!\" yelled Denman, uselessly, for all had seen. But he\nthrew a life-buoy fastened to the quarter, and was about to throw\nanother, when he looked, and saw that his first was a hundred feet this\nside of the struggling men.\n\nHe turned to glance forward. Men were running about frantically, and\nshouting, but nothing was done, and the boat still held at a matter of\nforty knots an hour. Riley grinned from the hatch; and, forward on the\nbridge, Forsythe turned his now sober face away, to look at the\ncompass, and at the steamer fast disappearing in the haze that followed\nher.\n\nThen, more as an outlet for his anger and disgust than in the hope of\nsaving life, Denman threw the second life-buoy high in air over the\nstern, and led the shocked and hysterical Florrie down the stairs.\n\n\"Rest here a while,\" he said, gently, \"and try to forget it. I don't\nknow what they'll do now, but--keep your pistol with you at all times.\"\n\nHe went up with a grave face and many heartfelt misgivings; for, with\nForsythe and Riley now the master spirits, things might not go well with\nthem.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nIn about ten minutes Forsythe ground the wheel over and headed back;\nbut, though Denman kept a sharp lookout, he saw nothing of the two men\nor the life-buoys. He could feel no hope for Sampson, who was unable to\nswim. As for Jenkins, possibly a swimmer, even should he reach a\nlife-buoy, his plight would only be prolonged to a lingering death by\nhunger and thirst; for there was but one chance in a million that he\nwould be seen and picked up.\n\nAfter ten minutes on the back track, the boat was logically in about the\nsame position as when she had fled from the steamer; but Forsythe kept\non for another ten minutes, when, the haze having enveloped the whole\nhorizon, he stopped the engines, and the boat lost way, rolling\nsluggishly in the trough.\n\nThere was no wind, and nothing but the long ground swell and the haze to\ninconvenience them; the first in making it difficult to sight a\ntelescope, the second in hiding everything on the horizon, though hiding\nthe boat herself.\n\nBut at last Forsythe fixed something in the glass, gazing long and\nintently at a faint spot appearing to the northwest; and Denman,\nfollowing suit with the binoculars, saw what he was looking at--a huge\nbulk coming out of the haze carrying one short mast and five funnels.\nThen he remembered the descriptions he had read of the mighty\n_Gigantia_--the only ship afloat with five funnels since the _Great\nEastern_.\n\nForsythe called, and all hands flocked to the bridge, where they\ndiscussed the situation; and, as Denman judged by the many faces turned\nhis way, discussed him and Florrie. But whatever resulted from the\nlatter came to nothing.\n\nThey suddenly left the bridge, to disappear in the forecastle for a few\nmoments, then to reappear--each man belted and pistoled, and one\nbringing an outfit to Forsythe on the bridge.\n\nTwo engineers went to the engines, Forsythe rang full speed to them, and\nthe rest, cooks and all, swung the four torpedo tubes to port and manned\nthe forward one.\n\nThe big ship seemed to grow in size visibly as her speed, plus the\ndestroyer's, brought them together. In a few moments Denman made out\ndetails--six parallel lines of deadlights, one above the other, and\nextending from bow to stern, a length of a thousand feet; three tiers of\ndeck houses, one above the other amidships; a line of twenty boats to a\nside along the upper deck, and her after rails black with passengers;\nwhile as many as six uniformed officers stood on her bridge--eighty feet\nabove the water line.\n\nThe little destroyer rounded to alongside, and slowed down to a little\nmore than the speed of the larger ship, which permitted her to creep\nalong the huge, black side, inch by inch, until the bridges were nearly\nabreast. Then a white-whiskered man on the high bridge hailed:\n\n\"Steamer ahoy! What do you want?\"\n\n\"Want all that bullion stowed in your strong room,\" answered Forsythe\nthrough a megaphone; \"and, if you please, speak more distinctly, for the\nwash of your bow wave prevents my hearing what you say.\"\n\nThe officer was handed a megaphone, and through it his voice came down\nlike a thunderclap.\n\n\"You want the bullion stowed in our strong room, do you? Anything else\nyou want, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Forsythe. \"We want a boat full of provisions. Three\nbarrels of flour, the rest in canned meats and vegetables.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\" There was as much derision in the voice as can carry\nthrough a megaphone.\n\n\"That is all,\" answered Forsythe. \"Load your gold into one of your own\nboats, the provisions in another. Lower them down and let the falls\nunreeve, so that they will go adrift. We will pick them up.\"\n\n\"Well, of all the infernal impudence I ever heard, yours is the worst. I\njudge that you are that crew of jail-breakers we've heard of that stole\na government boat and turned pirates.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" answered Forsythe; \"but don't waste our time. Will you\ngive us what we asked for, or shall we sink you?\"\n\n\"Sink us, you scoundrel? You can't, and you'd better not try, or\nthreaten to. Your position is known, and three scouts started this\nmorning from Boston and New York.\"\n\n\"That bluff don't go,\" answered Forsythe. \"Will you cough up?\"\n\n\"No; most decidedly _no_!\" roared the officer, who might, or might not,\nhave been the captain.\n\n\"Kelly,\" said Forsythe, \"send that Whitehead straight into him.\"\n\nWhitehead torpedoes, be it known, are mechanical fish of machined steel,\nself-propelling and self-steering, actuated by a small air engine, and\ncarrying in their \"war heads\" a charge of over two hundred pounds of\nguncotton, and in their blunt noses a detonating cap to explode it on\ncontact.\n\nAt Forsythe's word, Kelly turned a lever on the tube, and the contained\ntorpedo dived gently overboard.\n\nDenman, looking closely, saw it appear once on the surface,\nporpoiselike, before it dived to its indicated depth.\n\n\"The inhuman devil!\" he commented, with gritting teeth.\n\nA muffled report came from the depths. A huge mound of water lifted up,\nto break into shattered fragments and bubbles. Then these bubbles burst,\ngiving vent to clouds of brown and yellow smoke; while up through the\nventilators and out through the opened lower deadlights came more of\nthis smoke, and the sound of human voices, screaming and groaning. These\nsounds were drowned in the buzzing of thousands of other voices on deck\nas men, women, and children fought their way toward the stern.\n\n\"Do you agree?\" yelled Forsythe, through the megaphone. \"Do you agree,\nor shall we unload every torpedo we've got into your hull?\"\n\nOld Kelly had calmly marshaled the crew to the next torpedo, and looked\nup to Forsythe for the word. But it did not come.\n\nInstead, over the buzzing of the voices, came the officer's answer, loud\nand distinct:\n\n\"We agree. We understand that your necks are in the halter, and that you\nhave nothing to lose, even though you should fill every compartment and\ndrown every soul on board this ship. So we will accede to your demands.\nWe will fill one boat with the bullion and another with provisions, and\ncast them adrift. But do not fire again, for God's sake!\"\n\n\"All right,\" answered Forsythe. \"Bear a hand.\"\n\nBreast to breast, the two craft charged along, while two boats were\nlowered to the level of the main deck, and swiftered in to the rail.\nSailors appeared from the doors in pairs, each carrying a box that taxed\ntheir strength and made them stagger. There were ten in all, and they\nslowly and carefully ranged them along the bottom of one of the boats,\nso as to distribute their weight.\n\nWhile this was going on, stewards and galley helpers were filling the\nother boat with provisions--in boxes, barrels, and packages. Then the\nword was given, and the boats were cast off and lowered, the tackles of\nthe heavier groaning mightily under the strain.\n\nWhen they struck the water, the falls were instantly let go; and, as the\nboats drifted astern, the tackles unrove their long length from the\nblocks, and were hauled on board again.\n\nForsythe stopped the engines, and then backed toward the drifting boats.\nAs the destroyer passed the stern of the giant steamer, a shout rang\nout; but only Denman heard it above the buzzing of voices. And it seemed\nthat only he saw Casey spring from the high rail of the mammoth into the\nsea; for the rest were busy grappling for the boat's painters, and\nForsythe was looking aft.\n\nWhen the painters were secured and the boats drawn alongside, Forsythe\nrang for half speed; and the boat, under a port wheel, swung away from\nthe _Gigantia_, and went ahead.\n\n\"There is your man Casey,\" yelled Denman, excitedly. \"Are you going to\nleave him?\"\n\nForsythe, now looking dead ahead, seemed not to hear; but Riley spoke\nfrom the hatch:\n\n\"Hold yer jaw back there, or ye'll get a passage, too.\"\n\nWith Casey's cries in his ears--sick at heart in the belief that not\neven a life-buoy would avail, for the giant steamship had not stopped\nher engines throughout the whole transaction, and was now half a mile\naway, Denman went down to Florrie, obediently waiting, yet nervous and\nfrightened.\n\nHe told her nothing of what had occurred--but soothed and quieted her\nwith the assurance that they would be rescued soon.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nThe engine stopped; and, climbing the steps to look forward, Denman saw\nthe bridge deserted, and the whole ten surrounding an equal number of\nstrong boxes, stamped and burned with official-looking letters and\nnumbers. Farther along were the provision; and a peep astern showed\nDenman the drifting boats.\n\nThe big _Gigantia_ had disappeared in the haze that hid the whole\nhorizon; but up in the western sky was a portent--a black silhouette of\nirregular out-line, that grew larger as he looked.\n\nIt was a monoplane--an advance scout of a scout boat--and Denman\nrecognized the government model. It seemed to have sighted the\ndestroyer, for it came straight on with a rush, circled overhead, and\nturned back.\n\nThere was no signal made; and, as it dwindled away in the west, Denman's\nattention was attracted to the men surrounding the boxes; only Munson\nwas still watching the receding monoplane. But the rest were busy. With\nhammers and cold chisels from the engine room they were opening the\nboxes of treasure.\n\n\"Did any one see that fellow before?\" demanded Munson, pointing to the\nspot in the sky.\n\nA few looked, and the others answered with oaths and commands: \"Forget\nit! Open the boxes! Let's have a look at the stuff!\"\n\nBut Munson spoke again. \"Forsythe, how about the big fellow's wireless?\nWe didn't disable it. He has sent the news already. What do you think?\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up!\" answered Forsythe, irately. \"I didn't think of it.\nNeither did any one. What of it? Nothing afloat can catch us. Open the\nbox. Let's have a look, and we'll beat it for Africa.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" vociferated Munson, \"that you'd better start now--at full\nspeed, too. That's a scout, and the mother boat isn't far away.\"\n\n\"Will you shut up, or will I shut you up?\" shouted Forsythe.\n\n\"You'll not shut me up,\" retorted Munson. \"You're the biggest fool in\nthis bunch, in spite of your bluff. Why don't you go ahead and get out\no' this neighborhood?\"\n\nA box cover yielded at this juncture, and Forsythe did not immediately\nanswer. Instead, with Munson himself, and Billings the cook--insanely\nemitting whoops and yelps as he danced around for a peep--he joined the\nothers in tearing out excelsior from the box. Then the bare contents\ncame to view.\n\n\"Lead!\" howled Riley, as he stood erect, heaving a few men back with his\nshoulders. \"Lead it is, if I know wan metal from another.\"\n\n\"Open them all,\" roared Forsythe. \"Get the axes--pinch bars--anything.\"\n\n\"Start your engine!\" yelled Munson; but he was not listened to.\n\nWith every implement that they could lay their hands on they attacked\nthe remaining boxes; and, as each in turn disclosed its contents, there\nwent up howls of disappointment and rage. \"Lead!\" they shouted at last.\n\"All lead! Was this job put up for us?\"\n\n\"No,\" yelled Munson, \"not for us. Every steamer carrying bullion also\ncarries lead in the same kind of boxes. I've read of it many a time.\nIt's a safeguard against piracy. We've been fooled--that's all.\"\n\nForsythe answered profanely and as coherently as his rage and excitement\nwould permit.\n\nMunson replied by holding his fist under Forsythe's nose.\n\n\"Get up on the bridge,\" he said. \"And you, Riley, to your engines.\"\n\nRiley obeyed the call of the exigency; but Forsythe resisted. He struck\nMunson's fist away, but received it immediately full in the face.\nStaggering back, he pulled his revolver; and, before Munson could meet\nthis new antagonism, he aimed and fired. Munson lurched headlong, and\nlay still.\n\nThen an uproar began. The others charged on Forsythe, who retreated,\nwith his weapon at arm's length. He held them off until, at his command,\nall but one had placed his pistol back in the scabbard. The dilatory one\nwas old Kelly; and him Forsythe shot through the heart. Then the pistols\nwere redrawn, and the shooting became general.\n\nHow Forsythe, single-handed against the eight remaining men, won in that\ngun fight can only be explained by the fact that the eight were too\nwildly excited to aim, or leave each other free to attempt aiming; while\nForsythe, a single target, only needed to shoot at the compact body of\nmen to make a hit.\n\nIt ended soon with Hawkes, Davis, and Daniels writhing on the deck, and\nForsythe hiding, uninjured, behind the forward funnel; while Riley,\nKing, and Dwyer, the three engineers, were retreating into their engine\nroom.\n\n\"Now, if you've had enough,\" shouted Forsythe, \"start the engine when I\ngive you the bells.\" Then he mounted to the bridge and took the wheel.\n\nBut, though the starting of the engines at full speed indicated that the\nengineers had had enough, there was one man left who had not. It was\nBillings, who danced around the dead and the wounded, shrieking and\nlaughing with the emotions of his disordered brain. But he did not fire\non Forsythe, and seemed to have forgotten the animus of the recent\nfriction.\n\nHe drifted aft, muttering to himself, until suddenly he stopped, and\nfixed his eyes on Denman, who, with gritting teeth, had watched the\ndeadly fracas at the companion.\n\n\"I told you so. I told you so,\" rang out the crazed voice of Billings.\n\"A woman aboard ship--a woman aboard ship. Always makes trouble. There,\ntake it!\"\n\nHe pulled his revolver and fired; and Denman, stupefied with the\nunexpected horror of it all, did not know that Florrie had crept up\nbeside him in the companion until he heard her scream in conjunction\nwith the whiz of the bullet through her hair. Then Denman awoke.\n\nAfter assuring himself of the girl's safety, and pushing her down the\ncompanion, he drew his revolver; and, taking careful aim, executed\nBillings with the cold calmness of a hangman.\n\nA bullet, nearly coincident with the report of a pistol, came from the\nbridge; and there was Forsythe, with one hand on the wheel, facing aft\nand taking second aim at him.\n\nDenman accepted the challenge, and stepped boldly out of the companion.\nThey emptied their revolvers, but neither did damage; and, as Forsythe\nreloaded, Denman cast a momentary glance at a black spot in the southern\nsky.\n\nHurriedly sweeping the upper horizon, he saw still another to the east;\nwhile out of the haze in the northwest was emerging a scout cruiser; no\ndoubt the \"mother\" of the first monoplane. She was but two miles away,\nand soon began spitting shot and shell, which plowed up the water\nperilously near.\n\n\"You're caught, Forsythe,\" called out Denman, pointing to the south and\neast. \"Will you surrender before we're sunk or killed?\"\n\nForsythe's answer was another shot.\n\n\"Florrie,\" called Denman down the companion, \"hand me your gun and pass\nup the tablecloth; then get down that hatch out of the way. We're being\nfired at.\"\n\nShe obeyed him; and, with Forsythe's bullets whistling around his head,\nhe hoisted the flag of truce and surrender to the flagstaff. But just a\nmoment too late. A shell entered the boat amidships and exploded in her\nvitals, sending up through the engine-room hatch a cloud of smoke and\nwhite steam, while fragments of the shell punctured the deck from below.\nBut there were no cries of pain or calls for help from the three men in\nthe engine room.\n\nForsythe left the bridge. Breathing vengeance and raging like a madman,\nhe rushed aft.\n\n\"I'll see you go first!\" he shrieked. He fired again and again as he\ncame; then, realizing that he had but one bullet left in his pistol, he\nhalted at the galley hatch, took careful aim, and pulled the trigger for\nthe last time.\n\nThere are tricks of the fighting trade taught to naval officers that are\nnot included in the curriculum at Annapolis. Denman, his loaded revolver\nhanging in his right hand at his side, had waited for this final shot.\nLike a duelist he watched, not his opponent's hand, but his eye; and,\nthe moment that eye gave him the unconcealable signal to the trigger\nfinger, he ducked his head, and the bullet sped above.\n\n\"Now, Forsythe,\" he said, as he covered the chagrined marksman, \"you\nshould have aimed lower and to the right--but that's all past now. This\nboat is practically captured, and I'm not going to kill you; for, even\nthough it would not be murder, there is no excuse in my conscience for\nit. Whether the boat sinks or not, we will be taken off in time, for\nthat fellow over yonder is coming, and has ceased firing. But before you\nare out of my hands I want to settle an old score with you--one dating\nfrom our boyhood, which you'll perhaps remember. Toss that gun forward\nand step aft a bit.\"\n\nForsythe, his face working convulsively, obeyed him.\n\n\"Florrie!\" called Denman down the hatch. \"Come up now. We're all right.\"\n\nShe came, white in the face, and stood beside him.\n\n\"Off with your coat, Forsythe, and stand up to me. We'll finish that old\nfight. Here, girl, hold this gun.\"\n\nFlorrie took the pistol, and the two men discarded their jackets and\nfaced each other.\n\nThere is hardly need of describing in detail the fist fight that\nfollowed. It was like all such, where one man is slightly the superior\nof the other in skill, strength, and agility.\n\nIn this case that one was Denman; and, though again and again he felt\nthe weight of Forsythe's fist, and reeled to the deck occasionally, he\ngradually tired out his heavier, though weaker, adversary; and at last,\nwith the whole weight of his body behind it, dealt a crashing blow on\nForsythe's chin.\n\nDenman's old-time foe staggered backward and fell face upward. He rolled\nhis head to the right and to the left a few times, then sank into\nunconsciousness.\n\nDenman looked down on him, waiting for a movement, but none came.\nForsythe had been knocked out, and for the last time. Florrie's scream\naroused Denman.\n\n\"Is the boat sinking, Billie?\"\n\nHe looked, and sprang for a life-buoy, which he slipped over Florrie's\nhead. The bow of the boat was flush with the water, which was lapping at\nthe now quiet bodies of the dead and wounded men forward. He secured\nanother life-buoy for himself; and, as he donned the cork ring, a hail\ncame from abeam.\n\n\"Jump!\" it said. \"Jump, or you'll be carried down with the wash.\"\n\nThe big scout ship was but a few lengths away, and a boat full of armed\nmen was approaching.\n\nHand in hand they leaped into the sea; and Denman, towing the girl by\nthe becket of her life-buoy, paid no attention to the sinking hull until\nsatisfied that they were safe from the suction.\n\nWhen he looked, the bow was under water, the stern rising in the air,\nhigher and higher, until a third of the after body was exposed; then it\nslid silently, but for the bursting of huge air bubbles, out of sight in\nthe depths.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout a year later, Lieutenant Denman received a letter with a Paris\npostmark, which he opened in the presence of his wife. In it was a draft\non a Boston bank, made out to his order.\n\n\"Good!\" he exclaimed, as he glanced down the letter. \"Listen, Florrie,\nhere's something that pleases me as much as my exoneration by the Board\nof Inquiry.\" Then he read to her the letter:\n\n    \"DEAR SIR: Inasmuch as you threw two life-buoys over for us you may\n    be glad, even at this late period, to know that we got them. The\n    fight stopped when we hit the water, and since then Sampson and\n    myself have been chums. I saw both buoys thrown and held Sampson up\n    while I swam with him to the first; then, from the top of a sea, I\n    saw the other, and, getting it, returned to him. We were picked up\n    by a fisherman next day, but you will not mind, sir, if I do not\n    tell you where we landed, or how we got here, or where we'll be when\n    this letter reaches you. We will not be here, and never again in the\n    United States. Yet we want to thank you for giving us a chance for\n    our lives.\n\n    \"We read in the Paris _Herald_ of your hearing before the Board of\n    Inquiry, and the story you told of the mess Forsythe made of things,\n    and the final sinking of the boat. Of course we were sorry for them,\n    for they were our mates; but they ought not to have gone back on\n    Casey, even though they saw fit to leave Sampson and me behind. And,\n    thinking this way, we are glad that you licked Forsythe, even at the\n    last minute.\n\n    \"We inclose a draft for five hundred and fifty dollars, which we\n    would like you to cash, and pay the captain, whose name we do not\n    know, the money we took from his desk. We hope that what is left\n    will square up for the clothes and money we took from your room. You\n    see, as we did not give Casey but a little of the money, and it came\n    in mighty handy for us two when we got ashore, it seems that we are\n    obligated to return it. I will only say, to conclude, that we got it\n    honestly.\n\n    \"Sampson joins with me in our best respects to Miss Fleming and\n    yourself.\n\n                                     \"Truly yours,\n\n                                                    \"HERBERT JENKINS.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm glad, Billie!\" she exclaimed. \"They are honest men, after all.\"\n\n\"Honest men?\" repeated Denman, quizzically. \"Yet they stole a fine\ndestroyer from Uncle Sam!\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" she said, stoutly. \"I'm glad they were saved. And,\nBillie boy\"--her hands were on his shoulders--\"if they hadn't stolen\nthat fine destroyer, I wouldn't be here to-day looking into your eyes.\"\n\nAnd Billie, gathering her into his arms, let it go at that.\n\n\n\n\nBEYOND THE SPECTRUM\n\n\nThe long-expected crisis was at hand, and the country was on the verge\nof war. Jingoism was rampant. Japanese laborers were mobbed on the\nwestern slope, Japanese students were hazed out of colleges, and\nJapanese children stoned away from playgrounds. Editorial pages sizzled\nwith burning words of patriotism; pulpits thundered with invocations to\nthe God of battles and prayers for the perishing of the way of the\nungodly. Schoolboy companies were formed and paraded with wooden guns;\namateur drum-corps beat time to the throbbing of the public pulse;\nmilitia regiments, battalions, and separate companies of infantry and\nartillery, drilled, practiced, and paraded; while the regular army was\nrushed to the posts and garrisons of the Pacific Coast, and the navy, in\nthree divisions, guarded the Hawaiian Islands, the Philippines, and the\nlarger ports of western America. For Japan had a million trained men,\nwith transports to carry them, battle-ships to guard them; with the\nchoice of objective when she was ready to strike; and she was displaying\na national secrecy about her choice especially irritating to molders of\npublic opinion and lovers of fair play. War was not yet declared by\neither side, though the Japanese minister at Washington had quietly\nsailed for Europe on private business, and the American minister at\nTokio, with several consuls and clerks scattered around the ports of\nJapan, had left their jobs hurriedly, for reasons connected with their\ngeneral health. This was the situation when the cabled news from Manila\ntold of the staggering into port of the scout cruiser _Salem_ with a\nsteward in command, a stoker at the wheel, the engines in charge of\nfiremen, and the captain, watch-officers, engineers, seamen gunners, and\nthe whole fighting force of the ship stricken with a form of partial\nblindness which in some cases promised to become total.\n\nThe cruiser was temporarily out of commission and her stricken men in\nthe hospital; but by the time the specialists had diagnosed the trouble\nas amblyopia, from some sudden shock to the optic nerve--followed in\ncases by complete atrophy, resulting in amaurosis--another ship came\ninto Honolulu in the same predicament. Like the other craft four\nthousand miles away, her deck force had been stricken suddenly and at\nnight. Still another, a battle-ship, followed into Honolulu, with fully\nfive hundred more or less blind men groping around her decks; and the\nadmiral on the station called in all the outriders by wireless. They\ncame as they could, some hitting sand-bars or shoals on the way, and\nevery one crippled and helpless to fight. The diagnosis was the\nsame--amblyopia, atrophy of the nerve, and incipient amaurosis; which in\nplain language meant dimness of vision increasing to blindness.\n\nThen came more news from Manila. Ship after ship came in, or was towed\nin, with fighting force sightless, and the work being done by the \"black\ngang\" or the idlers, and each with the same report--the gradual dimming\nof lights and outlines as the night went on, resulting in partial or\ntotal blindness by sunrise. And now it was remarked that those who\nescaped were the lower-deck workers, those whose duties kept them off\nthe upper deck and away from gunports and deadlights. It was also\nsuggested that the cause was some deadly attribute of the night air in\nthese tropical regions, to which the Americans succumbed; for, so far,\nthe coast division had escaped.\n\nIn spite of the efforts of the Government, the Associated Press got the\nfacts, and the newspapers of the country changed the burden of their\npronouncements. Bombastic utterances gave way to bitter criticism of an\ninefficient naval policy that left the ships short of fighters in a\ncrisis. The merging of the line and the staff, which had excited much\nridicule when inaugurated, now received more intelligent attention.\nFormer critics of the change not only condoned it, but even demanded the\nwholesale granting of commissions to skippers and mates of the merchant\nservice; and insisted that surgeons, engineers, paymasters, and\nchaplains, provided they could still see to box the compass, should be\ngiven command of the torpedo craft and smaller scouts. All of which made\nyoung Surgeon Metcalf, on waiting orders at San Francisco, smile sweetly\nand darkly to himself: for his last appointment had been the command of\na hospital ship, in which position, though a seaman, navigator, and\ngraduate of Annapolis, he had been made the subject of newspaper\nridicule and official controversy, and had even been caricatured as\ngoing into battle in a ship armored with court-plaster and armed with\nhypodermic syringes.\n\nMetcalf had resigned as ensign to take up the study and practice of\nmedicine, but at the beginning of the war scare had returned to his\nfirst love, relinquishing a lucrative practice as eye-specialist to\ntender his services to the Government. And the Government had responded\nby ranking him with his class as junior lieutenant, and giving him the\naforesaid command, which he was glad to be released from. But his\nclassmates and brother officers had not responded so promptly with\ntheir welcome, and Metcalf found himself combating a naval etiquette\nthat was nearly as intolerant of him as of other appointees from civil\nlife. It embittered him a little, but he pulled through; for he was a\nlikable young fellow, with a cheery face and pleasant voice, and even\nthe most hide-bound product of Annapolis could not long resist his\npersonality. So he was not entirely barred out of official gossip and\nspeculations, and soon had an opportunity to question some convalescents\nsent home from Honolulu. All told the same story and described the same\nsymptoms, but one added an extra one. An itching and burning of the face\nhad accompanied the attack, such as is produced by sunburn.\n\n\"And where were you that night when it came?\" asked Metcalf, eagerly.\n\n\"On the bridge with the captain and watch-officers. It was all hands\nthat night. We had made out a curious light to the north'ard, and were\ntrying to find out what it was.\"\n\n\"What kind of a light?\"\n\n\"Well, it was rather faint, and seemed to be about a mile away.\nSometimes it looked red, then green, or yellow, or blue.\"\n\n\"And then it disappeared?\"\n\n\"Yes, and though we steamed toward it with all the searchlights at work,\nwe never found where it came from.\"\n\n\"What form did it take--a beam or a glow?\"\n\n\"It wasn't a glow--radiation--and it didn't seem to be a beam. It was an\noccasional flash, and in this sense was like a radiation--that is, like\nthe spokes of a wheel, each spoke with its own color. But that was at\nthe beginning. In three hours none of us could have distinguished\ncolors.\"\n\nMetcalf soon had an opportunity to question others. The first batch of\ninvalid officers arrived from Manila, and these, on being pressed,\nadmitted that they had seen colored lights at the beginning of the\nnight. These, Metcalf remarked, were watch-officers, whose business was\nto look for strange lights and investigate them. But one of them added\nthis factor to the problem.\n\n\"And it was curious about Brainard, the most useless and utterly\nincompetent man ever graduated. He was so near-sighted that he couldn't\nsee the end of his nose without glasses; but it was he that took the\nship in, with the rest of us eating with our fingers and asking our way\nto the sick-bay.\"\n\n\"And Brainard wore his glasses that night?'\" asked Metcalf.\n\n\"Yes; he couldn't see without them. It reminds me of Nydia, the blind\ngirl who piloted a bunch out of Pompeii because she was used to the\ndarkness. Still, Brainard is hardly a parallel.\"\n\n\"Were his glasses the ordinary kind, or pebbles?\"\n\n\"Don't know. Which are the cheapest? That's the kind.\"\n\n\"The ordinary kind.\"\n\n\"Well, he had the ordinary kind--like himself. And he'll get special\npromotion. Oh, Lord! He'll be jumped up a dozen numbers.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Metcalf, mysteriously, \"perhaps not. Just wait.\"\n\nMetcalf kept his counsel, and in two weeks there came Japan's\ndeclaration of war in a short curt note to the Powers at Washington.\nNext day the papers burned with news, cabled _via_ St. Petersburg and\nLondon, of the sailing of the Japanese fleet from its home station, but\nfor where was not given--in all probability either the Philippines or\nthe Hawaiian Islands. But when, next day, a torpedo-boat came into San\nFrancisco in command of the cook, with his mess-boy at the wheel,\nconservatism went to the dogs, and bounties were offered for enlistment\nat the various navy-yards, while commissions were made out as fast as\nthey could be signed, and given to any applicant who could even pretend\nto a knowledge of yachts. And Surgeon George Metcalf, with the rank of\njunior lieutenant, was ordered to the torpedo-boat above mentioned, and\nwith him as executive officer a young graduate of the academy, Ensign\nSmith, who with the enthusiasm and courage of youth combined the\nmediocrity of inexperience and the full share of the service prejudice\nagainst civilians.\n\nThis prejudice remained in full force, unmodified by the desperate\nsituation of the country; and the unstricken young officers filling\nsubordinate positions on the big craft, while congratulating him, openly\ndenied his moral right to a command that others had earned a better\nright to by remaining in the service; and the old jokes, jibes, and\nsatirical references to syringes and sticking-plaster whirled about his\nhead as he went to and fro, fitting out his boat and laying in supplies.\nAnd when they learned--from young Mr. Smith--that among these supplies\nwas a large assortment of plain-glass spectacles, of no magnifying power\nwhatever, the ridicule was unanimous and heartfelt; even the newspapers\ntaking up the case from the old standpoint and admitting that the line\nought to be drawn at lunatics and foolish people. But Lieutenant Metcalf\nsmiled and went quietly ahead, asking for and receiving orders to scout.\n\nHe received them the more readily, as all the scouts in the squadron,\nincluding the torpedo-flotilla and two battle-ships, had come in with\nblinded crews. Their stories were the same--they had all seen the\nmysterious colored lights, had gone blind, and a few had felt the\nitching and tingling of sunburn. And the admiral gleaned one crew of\nwhole men from the fleet, and with it manned his best ship, the\n_Delaware_.\n\nMetcalf went to sea, and was no sooner outside the Golden Gate than he\nopened his case of spectacles, and scandalized all hands, even his\nexecutive officer, by stern and explicit orders to wear them night and\nday, putting on a pair himself as an example.\n\nA few of the men attested good eyesight; but this made no difference, he\nexplained. They were to wear them or take the consequences, and as the\nfirst man to take the consequences was Mr. Smith, whom he sent to his\nroom for twenty-four hours for appearing on deck without them five\nminutes afterward, the men concluded that he was in earnest and obeyed\nthe order, though with smiles and silent ridicule. Another explicit\ncommand they received more readily: to watch out for curious-looking\ncraft, and for small objects such as floating casks, capsized tubs or\nboats, et cetera. And this brought results the day after the penitent\nSmith was released. They sighted a craft without spars steaming along on\nthe horizon and ran down to her. She was a sealer, the skipper\nexplained, when hailed, homeward bound under the auxiliary. She had been\non fire, but the cause of the fire was a mystery. A few days before a\nstrange-looking vessel had passed them, a mile away. She was a whaleback\nsort of a hull, with sloping ends, without spars or funnels, only a slim\npole amidships, and near its base a projection that looked like a\nliner's crow's-nest. While they watched, their foremast burst into\nflames, and while they were rigging their hose the mainmast caught fire.\nBefore this latter was well under way they noticed a round hole burnt\ndeeply into the mast, of about four inches diameter. Next, the topsides\ncaught fire, and they had barely saved their craft, letting their masts\nburn to do so.\n\n\"Was it a bright, sunshiny day?\" asked Metcalf.\n\n\"Sure. Four days ago. He was heading about sou'west, and going slow.\"\n\n\"Anything happen to your eyesight?\"\n\n\"Say--yes. One of my men's gone stone blind. Thinks he must have looked\nsquarely at the sun when he thought he was looking at the fire up\naloft.\"\n\n\"It wasn't the sun. Keep him in utter darkness for a week at least.\nHe'll get well. What was your position when you met that fellow?\"\n\n\"About six hundred miles due nor'west from here.\"\n\n\"All right. Look out for Japanese craft. War is declared.\"\n\nMetcalf plotted a new course, designed to intercept that of the\nmysterious craft, and went on, so elated by the news he had heard that\nhe took his gossipy young executive into his confidence.\n\n\"Mr. Smith,\" he said, \"that sealer described one of the new seagoing\nsubmersibles of the Japanese, did he not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I think he did--a larger submarine, without any conning-tower\nand the old-fashioned periscope. They have seven thousand miles'\ncruising radius, enough to cross the Pacific.\"\n\nBy asking questions of various craft, and by diligent use of a\ntelescope, Metcalf found his quarry three days later--a log-like object\non the horizon, with the slim white pole amidships and the excrescence\nnear its base.\n\n\"Wait till I get his bearing by compass,\" said Metcalf to his chief\nofficer, \"then we'll smoke up our specs and run down on him. Signal him\nby the International Code to put out his light, and to heave to, or\nwe'll sink him.\"\n\nMr. Smith bowed to his superior, found the numbers of these commands in\nthe code book, and with a string of small flags at the signal-yard, and\nevery man aboard viewing the world darkly through a smoky film, the\ntorpedo-boat approached the stranger at thirty knots. But there was no\nblinding glare of light in their eyes, and when they were within a\nhundred yards of the submersible, Metcalf removed his glasses for a\nmoment's distinct vision. Head and shoulders out of a hatch near the\ntube was a man waving a white handkerchief. He rang the stopping bells.\n\n\"He surrenders, Mr. Smith,\" he said, joyously, \"and without firing a\ntorpedo!\"\n\nHe examined the man through the telescope and laughed.\n\n\"I know him,\" he said. Then funneling his hands, he hailed:\n\n\"Do you surrender to the United States of America?\"\n\n\"I surrender,\" answered the man. \"I am helpless.\"\n\n\"Then come aboard without arms. I'll send a boat.\"\n\nA small dinghy-like boat was dispatched, and it returned with the man, a\nJapanese in lieutenant's uniform, whose beady eyes twinkled in alarm as\nMetcalf greeted him.\n\n\"Well, Saiksi, you perfected it, didn't you?--my invisible searchlight,\nthat I hadn't money to go on with.\"\n\nThe Jap's eyes sought the deck, then resumed their Asiatic steadiness.\n\n\"Metcalf--this you,\" he said, \"in command? I investigated and heard you\nhad resigned to become a doctor.\"\n\n\"But I came back to the service, Saiksi. Thanks to you and your\nlight--my light, rather--I am in command here in place of men you\nblinded. Saiksi, you deserve no consideration from me, in spite of our\nrooming together at Annapolis. You took--I don't say stole--my\ninvention, and turned it against the country that educated you. You, or\nyour _confr\u00c3\u00a8res_, did this before a declaration of war. You are a\npirate, and I could string you up to my signal-yard and escape\ncriticism.\"\n\n\"I was under orders from my superiors, Captain Metcalf.\"\n\n\"They shall answer to mine. You shall answer to me. How many boats have\nyou equipped with my light?\"\n\n\"There are but three. It is very expensive.\"\n\n\"One for our Philippine squadron, one for the Hawaiian, and one for the\ncoast. You overdid things, Saiksi. If you hadn't set fire to that sealer\nthe other day, I might not have found you. It was a senseless piece of\nwork that did you no good. Oh, you are a sweet character! How do you get\nyour ultraviolet rays--by filtration or prismatic dispersion?\"\n\n\"By filtration.\"\n\n\"Saiksi, you're a liar as well as a thief. The colored lights you use to\nattract attention are the discarded rays of the spectrum. No wonder you\ninvestigated me before you dared flash such a decoy! Well, I'm back in\nthe navy, and I've been investigating you. As soon as I heard of the\nfirst symptom of sunburn, I knew it was caused by the ultraviolet rays,\nthe same as from the sun; and I knew that nothing but my light could\nproduce those rays at night time. And as a physician I knew what I did\nnot know as an inventor--the swift amblyopia that follows the impact of\nthis light on the retina. As a physician, too, I can inform you that\nyour country has not permanently blinded a single American seaman or\nofficer. The effects wear off.\"\n\nThe Jap gazed stolidly before him while Metcalf delivered himself of\nthis, but did not reply.\n\n\"Where is the Japanese fleet bound?\" he asked, sternly.\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"And would not tell, whether you knew or not. But you said you were\nhelpless. What has happened to you? You can tell that.\"\n\n\"A simple thing, Captain Metcalf. My supply of oil leaked away, and my\nengines must work slowly. Your signal was useless; I could not have\nturned on the light.\"\n\n\"You have answered the first question. You are far from home without a\nmother-ship, or she would have found you and furnished oil before this.\nYou have come thus far expecting the fleet to follow and strike a\nhelpless coast before your supplies ran out.\"\n\nAgain the Jap's eyes dropped in confusion, and Metcalf went on.\n\n\"I can refurnish your boat with oil, my engineer and my men can handle\nher, and I can easily learn to manipulate your--or shall I say\n_our_--invisible searchlight. Hail your craft in English and order all\nhands on deck unarmed, ready for transshipment to this boat. I shall\njoin your fleet myself.\"\n\nA man was lounging in the hatchway of the submersible, and this man\nSaiksi hailed.\n\n\"Ae-hai, ae-hai, Matsu. We surrender. We are prisoner. Call up all men\nonto the deck. Leave arms behind. We are prisoner.\"\n\nThey mustered eighteen in all, and in half an hour they were ironed in a\nrow along the stanchioned rail of the torpedo-boat.\n\n\"You, too, Saiksi,\" said Metcalf, coming toward him with a pair of\njingling handcuffs.\n\n\"Is it not customary, Captain Metcalf,\" said the Jap, \"to parole a\nsurrendered commander?\"\n\n\"Not the surrendered commander of a craft that uses new and deadly\nweapons of war unknown to her adversary, and before the declaration of\nwar. Hold up your hands. You're going into irons with your men. All Japs\nlook alike to me, now.\"\n\nSo Lieutenant Saiksi, of the Japanese navy, was ironed beside his cook\nand meekly sat down on the deck. With the difference of dress, they\nreally did look alike.\n\nMetcalf had thirty men in his crew. With the assistance of his engineer,\na man of mechanics, he picked eighteen of this crew and took them and a\nbarrel of oil aboard the submersible. Then for three days the two craft\nlay together, while the engineer and the men familiarized themselves\nwith her internal economy--the torpedo-tubes, gasoline-engines,\nstorage-batteries, and motors; and the vast system of pipes, valves, and\nwires that gave life and action to the boat--and while Metcalf\nexperimented with the mysterious searchlight attached to the periscope\ntube invented by himself, but perfected by others. Part of his\ninvestigation extended into the night. Externally, the light resembled a\nhuge cup about two feet in diameter, with a thick disk fitted around it\nin a vertical plane. This disk he removed; then, hailing Smith to rig\nhis fire-hose and get off the deck, he descended the hatchway and turned\non the light, viewing its effects through the periscope. This, be it\nknown, is merely a perpendicular, non-magnifying telescope that, by\nmeans of a reflector at its upper end, gives a view of the seascape when\na submarine boat is submerged. And in the eyepiece at its base Metcalf\nbeheld a thin thread of light, of such dazzling brilliancy as to\nmomentarily blind him, stretch over the sea; but he put on his smoked\nglasses and turned the apparatus, tube and all, until the thin pencil of\nlight touched the end of the torpedo-boat's signal-yard. He did not need\nto bring the two-inch beam to a focus; it burst into flame and he\nquickly shut off the light and shouted to Smith to put out the\nfire--which Smith promptly did, with open comment to his handful of men\non this destruction of Government property.\n\n\"Good enough!\" he said to Smith, when next they met. \"Now if I'm any\ngood I'll give the Japs a taste of their own medicine.\"\n\n\"Take me along, captain,\" burst out Smith in sudden surrender. \"I don't\nunderstand all this, but I want to be in it.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Smith. The chief might do your work, but I doubt that you could\ndo his. I need him; so you can take the prisoners home. You will\nundoubtedly retain command.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir,\" answered the disappointed youngster, trying to conceal\nhis chagrin.\n\n\"I don't want you to feel badly about it. I know how you all felt toward\nme. But I'm on a roving commission. I have no wireless apparatus and no\ndefinite instructions. I've been lampooned and ridiculed in the papers,\nand I'm going to give them my answer--that is, as I said, if I'm any\ngood. If I'm not I'll be sunk.\"\n\nSo when the engineer had announced his mastery of his part of the\nproblem, and that there was enough of gasoline to cruise for two weeks\nlonger, Smith departed with the torpedo-boat, and Metcalf began his\nsearch for the expected fleet.\n\nIt was more by good luck than by any possible calculation that Metcalf\nfinally found the fleet. A steamer out of San Francisco reported that it\nhad not been heard from, and one bound in from Honolulu said that it was\nnot far behind--in fact had sent a shot or two. Metcalf shut off\ngasoline, waited a day, and saw the smoke on the horizon. Then he\nsubmerged to the awash condition, which in this boat just floated the\nsearchlight out of water; and thus balanced, neither floating nor\nsinking nor rolling, but rising and falling with the long pulsing of the\nground-swell, he watched through the periscope the approach of the\nenemy.\n\nIt was an impressive spectacle, and to a citizen of a threatened country\na disquieting one. Nine high-sided battle-ships of ten-gun type--nine\nfloating forts, each one, unopposed, able to reduce to smoking ruin a\ncity out of sight of its gunners; each one impregnable to the shell fire\nof any fortification in the world, and to the impact of the heaviest\ntorpedo yet constructed--they came silently along in line-ahead\nformation, like Indians on a trail. There were no compromises in this\nfleet. Like the intermediate batteries of the ships themselves, cruisers\nhad been eliminated and it consisted of extremes, battle-ships, and\ntorpedo-boats, the latter far to the rear. But between the two were half\na dozen colliers, repair, and supply ships.\n\nNight came down before they were near enough for operations, and Metcalf\nturned on his invisible light, expanding the beam to embrace the fleet\nin its light, and moved the boat to a position about a mile away from\nits path. It was a weird picture now showing in the periscope: each gray\nship a bluish-green against a background of black marked here and there\nby the green crest of a breaking sea. Within Metcalf's reach were the\nlevers, cranks, and worms that governed the action of the periscope and\nthe light; just before him were the vertical and horizontal\nsteering-wheels; under these a self-illuminating compass, and at his ear\na system of push-buttons, speaking-tubes, and telegraph-dials that put\nhim in communication with every man on the boat, each one of whom had\nhis part to play at the proper moment, but not one of whom could see or\nknow the result. The work to be done was in Metcalf's hands and brain,\nand, considering its potentiality, it was a most undramatic performance.\n\nHe waited until the leading flag-ship was within half a mile of being\nabreast; then, turning on a hanging electric bulb, he held it close to\nthe eyepiece of the periscope, knowing that the light would go up the\ntube through the lenses and be visible to the fleet. And in a moment he\nheard faintly through the steel walls the sound transmitted by the sea\nof a bugle-call to quarters. He shut off the bulb, watched a wandering\nshaft of light from the flag-ship seeking him, then contracted his own\ninvisible beam to a diameter of about three feet, to fall upon the\nflag-ship, and played it back and forth, seeking gun ports and apertures\nand groups of men, painting all with that blinding light that they could\nnot see, nor immediately sense. There was nothing to indicate that he\nhad succeeded; the faces of the different groups were still turned his\nway, and the futile searchlight still wandered around, unable to bring\nto their view the white tube with its cup-like base.\n\nStill waving the wandering beam of white light, the flag-ship passed on,\nbringing along the second in line, and again Metcalf turned on his bulb.\nHe heard her bugle-call, and saw, in varied shades of green, the\ntwinkling red and blue lights of her masthead signals, received from the\nflag-ship and passed down the line. And again he played that green disk\nof deadly light upon the faces of her crew. This ship, too, was seeking\nhim with her searchlight, and soon, from the whole nine, a moving\nnetwork of brilliant beams flashed and scintillated across the sky; but\nnot one settled upon the cause of their disquiet.\n\nShip after ship passed on, each with its bugle-call to quarters, each\nwith its muster of all hands to meet the unknown emergency--the menace\non a hostile coast of a faint white light on the port beam--but not one\nfiring a shot or shell; there was nothing to fire at. And with the\npassing of the last of the nine Metcalf listened to a snapping and a\nbuzzing overhead that told of the burning out of the carbons in the\nlight.\n\n\"Good work for the expenditure,\" he murmured, wearily. \"Let's see--two\ncarbons and about twenty amperes of current, against nine ships at ten\nmillions apiece. Well, we'll soon know whether or not it worked.\"\n\nWhile an electrician rigged new carbons he rested his eyes and his\nbrain; for the mental and physical strain had been severe. Then he\nplayed the light upon the colliers and supply ships as they charged by,\ndisposing of them in the same manner, and looked for other craft of\nlarger menace. But there were none, except the torpedo contingent, and\nthese he decided to leave alone. There were fifteen of them, each as\nspeedy and as easily handled as his own craft; and already, apprised by\nthe signaled instructions from ahead, they were spreading out into a\nfan-like formation, and coming on, nearly abreast.\n\n\"The jig's up, chief,\" he called through a tube to the engineer. \"We'll\nget forty feet down until the mosquitoes get by. I'd like to take a\nchance at them but there are too many. We'd get torpedoed, surely.\"\n\nDown went the diving rudder, and, with a kick ahead of the engine, the\nsubmersible shot under, heading on a course across the path of the\nfleet, and in half an hour came to the surface. There was nothing in\nsight, close by, either through the periscope or by direct vision, and\nMetcalf decided to make for San Francisco and report.\n\nIt was a wise decision, for at daylight he was floundering in a heavy\nsea and a howling gale from the northwest that soon forced him to\nsubmerge again for comfort. Before doing so, however, he enjoyed one\ngood look at the Japanese fleet, far ahead and to port. The line of\nformation was broken, staggered, and disordered; and, though the big\nships were making good weather of it, they were steering badly, and on\none of them, half-way to the signal-yard, was the appeal for help that\nships of all nations use and recognize--the ensign, upside-down. Under\nthe lee of each ship was snuggled a torpedo-boat, plunging, rolling, and\nswamped by the breaking seas that even the mighty bulk to windward could\nnot protect them from. And even as Metcalf looked, one twisted in two,\nher after funnels pointing to port, her forward to starboard, and in ten\nseconds had disappeared.\n\nMetcalf submerged and went on at lesser speed, but in comfort and\nsafety. Through the periscope he saw one after the other of the\ntorpedo-craft give up the fight they were not designed for, and ship\nafter ship hoist that silent prayer for help. They yawed badly, but in\nsome manner or other managed to follow the flag-ship, which, alone of\nthat armada, steered fairly well. She kept on the course for the Golden\nGate.\n\nEven submerged Metcalf outran the fleet before noon, and at night had\ndropped it, entering the Golden Gate before daylight, still submerged,\nnot only on account of the troublesome turmoil on the surface, but to\navoid the equally troublesome scrutiny of the forts, whose searchlights\nmight have caught him had he presented more to their view than a slim\ntube painted white. Avoiding the mines, he picked his way carefully up\nto the man-of-war anchorage, and arose to the surface, alongside the\n_Delaware_, now the flag-ship, as the light of day crept upward in the\neastern sky.\n\n\"We knew they were on the coast,\" said the admiral, a little later, when\nMetcalf had made his report on the quarter-deck of the _Delaware_. \"But\nabout this light? Are you sure of all this? Why, if it's so, the\nPresident will rank you over us all. Mr. Smith came in with the\nprisoners, but he said nothing of an invisible light--only of a strong\nsearchlight with which you set fire to the signal-yard.\"\n\n\"I did not tell him all, admiral,\" answered Metcalf, a little hurt at\nthe persistence of the feeling. \"But I'm satisfied now. That fleet is\ncoming on with incompetents on the bridge.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll soon know. I've only one ship, but it's my business to get\nout and defend the United States against invaders, and as soon as I can\nsteam against this gale and sea I'll go. And I'll want you, too. I'm\nshort-handed.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. I shall be glad to be with you. But wouldn't you like\nto examine the light?\"\n\n\"Most certainly,\" said the admiral; and, accompanied by his staff, he\nfollowed Metcalf aboard the submersible.\n\n\"It is very simple,\" explained Metcalf, showing a rough diagram he had\nsketched. \"You see he has used my system of reflectors about as I\ndesigned it. The focus of one curve coincides with the focus of the\nnext, and the result is a thin beam containing nearly all the radiations\nof the arc.\"\n\n\"Very simple,\" remarked the admiral, dryly. \"Very simple indeed. But,\nadmitting this strong beam of light that, as you say, could set fire to\nthat sealer, and be invisible in sunshine, how about the beam that is\ninvisible by night? That is what I am wondering about.\"\n\n\"Here, sir,\" removing the thick disk from around the light. \"This\ncontains the prisms, which refract the beam entirely around the lamp;\nand disperse it into the seven colors of the spectrum. All the visible\nlight is cut out, leaving only the ultraviolet rays, and these travel\nas fast and as far, and return by reflection, as though accompanied by\nthe visible rays.\"\n\n\"But how can you see it?\" asked an officer. \"How is the ship it is\ndirected at made visible?\"\n\n\"By fluorescence,\" answered Metcalf. \"The observer is the periscope\nitself. Any of the various fluorescing substances placed in the focus of\nthe object-glass, or at the optical image in front of the eyepiece, will\nshow the picture in the color peculiar to the fluorescing material. The\ncolor does not matter.\"\n\n\"More simple still,\" laughed the admiral. \"But how about the colored\nlights they saw?\"\n\n\"Simply the discarded light of the spectrum. By removing this cover on\nthe disk, the different colored rays shoot up. That was to attract\nattention. I used only white light through the periscope.\"\n\n\"And it was this invisible light that blinded so many men, which in your\nhands blinded the crews of the Japanese?\" asked the admiral.\n\n\"Yes, sir. The ultraviolet rays are beneficial as a germicide, but are\ndeadly if too strong.\"\n\n\"Lieutenant Metcalf,\" said the admiral, seriously, \"your future in the\nservice is secure. I apologize for laughing at you; but now that it's\nover and you've won, tell us about the spectacles.\"\n\n\"Why, admiral,\" responded Metcalf, \"that was the simplest proposition of\nall. The whole apparatus--prisms, periscope, lenses, and the fluorescing\nscreen--are made of rock crystal, which is permeable to the ultraviolet\nlight. But common glass, of which spectacles are made, is opaque to it.\nThat is why near-sighted men escaped the blindness.\"\n\n\"Then, unless the Japs are near-sighted, I expect an easy time when I go\nout.\"\n\nBut the admiral did not need to go out and fight. Those nine big\nbattle-ships that Japan had struggled for years to obtain, and the\nauxiliary fleet of supply and repair ships to keep them in life and\nhealth away from home, caught on a lee shore in a hurricane against\nwhich the mighty _Delaware_ could not steam to sea, piled up one by one\non the sands below Fort Point; and, each with a white flag replacing the\nreversed ensign, surrendered to the transport or collier sent out to\ntake off the survivors.\n\n\n\n\nIN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW\n\n\nThere are few facilities for cooking aboard submarine torpedo-boats, and\nthat is why Lieutenant Ross ran his little submarine up alongside the\nflag-ship at noon, and made fast to the boat-boom--the horizontal spar\nextending from warships, to which the boats ride when in the water. And,\nas familiarity breeds contempt, after the first, tentative, trial, he\nhad been content to let her hang by one of the small, fixed painters\ndepending from the boom; for his boat was small, and the tide weak,\nbringing little strain on painter or boom. Besides, this plan was good,\nfor it kept the submarine from bumping the side of the ship--and paint\nbelow the water-line is as valuable to a warship as paint above.\n\nThus moored, the little craft, with only her deck and conning-tower\nshowing, rode lightly at the end of her tether, while Ross and his\nmen--all but one, to watch--climbed aboard and ate their dinner.\n\nRoss finished quickly, and sought the deck; for, on going down to the\nwardroom, he had seen among the visitors from shore the one girl in the\nworld to him--the girl he had met at Newport, Washington, and New York,\nwhom he wanted as he wanted life, but whom he had not asked for yet,\nbecause he had felt so sure of her.\n\nAnd now this surety was jolted out of his consciousness; for she was\nthere escorted by a man she had often described, and whom Ross\nrecognized from the description--a tall, dark, \"captainish\"-looking\nfellow, with a large mustache; but who, far from being a captain or\nother kind of superman, was merely a photographer--yet a wealthy and\nsuccessful photographer, whose work was unusual and artistic.\n\nRoss, though an efficient naval officer, was anything but \"captainish\";\nhe was simply a clean-shaven, clean-cut young fellow, with a face that\nmirrored every emotion of his soul. Knowing this infirmity--if such it\nis--he resolutely put down the jealous thoughts that surged through his\nbrain; and when the visitors, guests of the captain, reached the deck,\nhe met them, and was introduced to Mr. Foster with as pleasant a face as\nthe girl had ever seen.\n\nThen, with the captain's permission, he invited them down to inspect his\nsubmarine. A plank from the lower grating of the gangway to the deck of\nthe smaller craft was all that was needed, and along this they went, the\ngirl ahead, supported by Mr. Foster, and Ross following, with a\nmessenger boy from the bridge following him.\n\nAt the hatch, the girl paused and shrank back, for the wide-open eyes of\nthe caretaker were looking up at her. Ross surmised this, and called to\nthe man to come up and get his dinner; then, as the man passed him and\nstepped onto the plank, the messenger got his attention. The officer of\nthe deck desired to speak with him, he said.\n\nRoss explained the manner of descent, admonished his guests to touch\nnothing until he returned, and followed the messenger back to the\nofficer of the deck. It was nothing of importance, simply a matter\npertaining to the afternoon drill; and, somewhat annoyed, Ross returned.\nBut he paused at the end of the plank; a loud voice from below halted\nhim, and he did not care to interrupt. Nor did he care to go back,\nleaving them alone in a submarine.\n\n\"I mean it,\" Foster was saying vehemently. \"I hope this boat does go to\nthe bottom.\"\n\n\"Why, Mr. Foster!\" cried the girl. \"What a sentiment!\"\n\n\"I tell you I mean it. You have made life unbearable.\"\n\n\"I make your life unbearable?\"\n\n\"Yes, you, Irene. You know I have loved you from the beginning. And you\nhave coquetted with me, played with me--as a cat plays with a mouse.\nWhen I have endeavored to escape, you have drawn me back by smiles and\nfavor, and given me hope. Then it is coldness and disdain. I am tired of\nit.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, Mr. Foster, if anything in my attitude has caused such an\nimpression. I have given you no special smiles or favors, no special\ncoldness or disdain.\"\n\n\"But I love you. I want you. I cannot live without you.\"\n\n\"You lived a long time without me, before we met.\"\n\n\"Yes, before we met. Before I fell under the spell of your personality.\nYou have hypnotized me, made yourself necessary to me. I am heartsick\nall the time, thinking of you.\"\n\n\"Then you must get over it, Mr. Foster. I must think of myself.\"\n\n\"Then you do not care for me, at all?\"\n\n\"I do, but only as an acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Not even as a friend?\"\n\n\"I do not like to answer such pointed questions, sir; but, since you\nask, I will tell you. I do not like you, even as a friend. You demand so\nmuch. You are very selfish, never considering my feelings at all, and\nyou often annoy me with your moods. Frankly, I am happier away from\nyou.\"\n\n\"My moods!\" Foster repeated, bitterly. \"You cause my moods. But I know\nwhat the real trouble is. I was all right until Ross came along.\"\n\n\"You have no right, Mr. Foster,\" said the girl, angrily, \"to bring\nLieutenant Ross' name into this discussion.\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand. Do you think he can marry you on his pay?\"\n\n\"Mr. Ross' pay would not influence him, nor me.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you this\"--and Foster's voice became a snarl--\"you two\nwon't be married. I'll see to it. I want you; and if I can't have you,\nno one else shall.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" whistled Ross, softly, while he smiled sweetly, and danced a\nmental jig in the air. Then he danced a few steps of a real jig, to\napprise them of his coming. \"Time to end this,\" he said; then called\nout, cheerily: \"Look out below,\" and entered the hatch.\n\n\"Got a bad habit,\" he said, as he descended, \"of coming down this ladder\nby the run. Must break myself, before I break my neck. Well, how are you\nmaking out? Been looking around?\"\n\nThe girl's face, pale but for two red spots in her cheeks, was turned\naway from him as he stepped off the ladder, and she trembled visibly.\nFoster, though flushed and scowling, made a better effort at\nself-control.\n\n\"Why, no, lieutenant,\" he said, with a sickly smile. \"It is all strange\nand new to us. We were waiting for you. But I have become slightly\ninterested in this--\" He indicated a circular window, fixed in the steel\nside of the boat. \"Isn't it a new feature in submarines?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" answered Ross. \"But it has long been known that glass will\nstand a stress equal to that of steel, so they've given us deadlights.\nSee the side of the ship out there? We can see objects about twenty feet\naway near the surface. Deeper down it is darker.\"\n\n\"And I suppose you see some interesting sights under water,\" pursued\nFoster, now recovered in poise.\n\n\"Yes, very interesting--and some very harrowing. I saw a man drowning\nnot long ago. We were powerless to help him.\"\n\n\"Heavens, what a sight!\" exclaimed Foster. \"The expression on his face\nmust have been tragic.\"\n\n\"Pitiful--the most pitiful I ever looked at. He seemed to be calling to\nus. Such agony and despair; but it did not last long.\"\n\n\"But while it _did_ last--did you have a camera? What a chance for a\nphotographer! That is my line, you know. Did ever a photographer get a\nchance to photograph the expression on the face of a drowning man? What\na picture it would be?\"\n\n\"Don't,\" said the girl, with a shudder. \"For mercy's sake, do not speak\nof such things.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Miss Fleming,\" said Ross, gently. \"It was very\ntactless in me.\"\n\n\"And I, Miss Fleming,\" said Foster, with a bow, \"was led away by\nprofessional enthusiasm. Please accept _my_ apology, too. Still,\nlieutenant, I must say that I would like the chance.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Mr. Foster,\" answered Ross, coldly. \"We do all sorts of things\nto men in the navy, but we don't drown them for the sake of their\npictures. Suppose I show you around, for at two bells the men will be\nback from their dinner. Now, aft here, is the gasoline engine, which we\nuse to propel the boat on the surface. We can't use it submerged,\nhowever, on account of the exhaust; so, for under-water work, we use a\nstrong storage battery to work a motor. You see the motor back there,\nand under this deck is the storage battery--large jars of sulphuric acid\nand lead. It is a bad combination if salt water floods it.\"\n\n\"How? What happens?\" asked Foster.\n\n\"Battery gas, or, in chemical terms, chlorine gas is formed. It is one\nof the most poisonous and suffocating of all gases. That is the real\ndanger in submarine boats--suffocation from chlorine. It will remain so\nuntil we get a better form of motive power, liquid or compressed air,\nperhaps. And here\"--Ross led them to a valve wheel amidships--\"as though\nto invite such disaster, they've given us a sea cock.\"\n\n\"What's it for?\" asked Foster.\n\n\"To sink the boat in case of fire. It's an inheritance from\nsteamboats--pure precedent--and useless, for a submarine cannot catch\nfire. Why, a few turns of that wheel when in the awash trim would admit\nenough water in two minutes to sink the boat. I've applied for\npermission to abolish it.\"\n\n\"Two minutes, you say. Does it turn easy? Would it be possible to\naccidentally turn it?\"\n\n\"Very easy, and very possible. I caution my men every day.\"\n\n\"And in case you do sink, and do not immediately suffocate, how do you\nrise?\"\n\n\"By pumping out the water. There's a strong pump connected with that\nmotor aft there, that will force out water against the pressure of the\nsea at fifty fathoms down. That is ten atmospheres--pretty hard\npressure. But, if the motor gets wet, it is useless to work the pump;\nso, we can be satisfied that, if we sink by means of the sea cock, we\nstay sunk. There is a hand pump, to use on the surface with dead\nbatteries, but it is useless at any great depth.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by the awash trim, lieutenant?\" asked Foster, who was\nnow looking out through the deadlight.\n\n\"The diving trim--that is, submerged all but the conning-tower. I'll\nshow you, so that you can say that you have really been under water.\"\n\nRoss turned a number of valves similar to the sea cock, and the girl's\nface took on a look of doubt and sudden apprehension.\n\n\"You are not going to sink the boat, are you, Mr. Ross?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, no, just filling the tanks. When full, we still have three hundred\npounds reserve buoyancy, and would have to go ahead and steer down. But\nwe won't go ahead. Come forward, and I'll show you the torpedo-tube.\"\n\nFoster remained, moodily staring through the deadlight, while the other\ntwo went forward. Ross noticed his abstraction, and, ascribing it to\nweariness of technical detail, did not press him to follow, and\ncontinued his lecture to Miss Fleming in a lower tone and in evident\nembarrassment.\n\n\"Now, here is the tube,\" he said. \"See this rear door. It is\nwater-tight. When a torpedo is in the tube, as it is now, we admit\nwater, as well; and, to expel the torpedo, we only have to open the\nforward door, apply compressed air, and out it goes. Then it propels and\nsteers itself. We have a theory--no, not a theory now, for it has been\nproved--that, in case of accident, a submarine's crew can all be ejected\nthrough the tube except the last man. He must remain to die, for he\ncannot eject himself. That man\"--Ross smiled and bowed low to the\ngirl--\"must be the commander.\"\n\n\"How terrible!\" she answered, interested, but looking back abstractedly\nat Foster. \"Why do you remain at this work? Your life is always in\ndanger.\"\n\n\"And on that account promotion is more probable. I want promotion, and\nmore pay\"--he lowered his voice and took her hand--\"so that I may ask\nfor the love and the life companionship of the dearest and best girl in\nthe world.\"\n\nShe took her gaze off Foster, cast one fleeting glance into the young\nlieutenant's pleading face, then dropped her eyes to the deck, while her\nface flushed rosily. But she did not withdraw her hand.\n\n\"Must you wait for promotion?\" she said, at length.\n\n\"No, Irene, no,\" exclaimed Ross, excitedly, squeezing the small hand in\nhis own. \"Not if you say so; but I have nothing but my pay.\"\n\n\"I have always been poor,\" she said, looking him frankly in the face.\n\"But, John, that is not it. I am afraid. He--Mr. Foster, threatened\nus--vowed we would never-- Oh, and he turned something back there after\nyou started. He did it so quickly--I just barely saw him as I turned to\nfollow you. I do not know what it was. I did not understand what you\nwere describing.\"\n\n\"He turned something! What?\"\n\n\"It was a wheel of some kind.\"\n\nRoss looked at Foster. He was now on the conning-tower ladder, half-way\nup, looking at his opened watch, with a lurid, malevolent twist to his\nfeatures.\n\n\"Say your prayers!\" yelled Foster, insanely. \"You two are going to die,\nI say. Die, both of you.\"\n\nHe sprang up the ladder, and Ross bounded aft, somewhat bewildered by\nthe sudden turn of events. He was temporarily at his wits' end. But when\nFoster floundered down to the deck in a deluge of water from above, and\nthe conning-tower hatch closed with a ringing clang, he understood. One\nlook at the depth indicator was enough. The boat was sinking. He sprang\nto the sea-cock valve. It was wide open.\n\n\"Blast your wretched, black heart and soul,\" he growled, as he hove the\nwheel around. \"Did you open this valve? Hey, answer me. You did, didn't\nyou? And thought to escape yourself--you coward!\"\n\n\"Oh, God!\" cried Foster, running about distractedly. \"We're sinking, and\nI can't get out.\"\n\nRoss tightened the valve, and sprang toward him, the murder impulse\nstrong in his soul. In imagination, he felt his fingers on the throat of\nthe other, and every strong muscle of his arms closing more tightly his\ngrip. Then their plight dominated his thoughts; he merely struck out\nsilently, and knocked the photographer down.\n\n\"Get up,\" he commanded, as the prostrate man rolled heavily over on his\nhands and knees. \"Get up, I may need you.\"\n\nFoster arose, and seated himself on a torpedo amidships, where he sank\nhis head in his hands. With a glance at him, and a reassuring look at\nthe girl, who still remained forward, Ross went aft to connect up the\npump. But as he went, he noticed that the deck inclined more and more\nwith each passing moment.\n\nHe found the depressed engine room full of water, and the motor flooded.\nIt was useless to start it; it would short-circuit at the first contact;\nand he halted, wondering at the boat's being down by the stern so much,\nuntil a snapping sound from forward apprised him of the reason.\n\nThe painter at the boom had held her nose up until the weight was too\nmuch for it, and, with its parting, the little craft assumed nearly an\neven keel, while the water rushed forward among the battery jars beneath\nthe deck. Then a strong, astringent odor arose through the seams in the\ndeck, and Ross became alive.\n\n\"Battery gas!\" he exclaimed, as he ran amidships, tumbling Foster off\nthe torpedo with a kick--for he was in his way. He reached up and\nturned valve after valve, admitting compressed air from the flasks to\nthe filled tanks, to blow out the water. This done, he looked at the\ndepth indicator; it registered seventy feet; but, before he could\ndetermine the speed of descent, there came a shock that permeated the\nwhole boat. They were on the bottom.\n\n\"And Lord only knows,\" groaned Ross, \"how much we've taken in! But it's\nonly three atmospheres, thank God. Here, you,\" he commanded to the\nnerveless Foster, who had again found a seat. \"Lend a hand on this pump.\nI'll deal with your case when we get up.\"\n\n\"What must I do?\" asked Foster, plaintively, as he turned his face, an\nashy green now, toward Ross.\n\n\"Pump,\" yelled Ross, in his ear. \"Pump till you break your back if\nnecessary. Ship that brake.\"\n\nHe handed Foster his pump-brake, and they shipped them in the hand-pump.\nBut, heave as they might, they could not move it, except in jerks of\nabout an inch. With an old-fashioned force-pump, rusty from disuse, a\nthree-inch outlet, and three atmospheres of pressure, pumping was\nuseless, and they gave it up, even though the girl added her little\nweight and strength to the task.\n\nRoss had plenty of compressed air in the numerous air flasks scattered\nabout, and, as he could blow out no more tanks, he expended a jet into\nthe choking atmosphere of the boat. It sweetened the air a little, but\nthere was enough of the powerful, poisonous gas generated to keep them\nall coughing continually. However, he seated the girl close to the air\njet, so that she need not suffer more than was necessary.\n\n\"Are we in danger, John?\" she asked. \"Real danger, I mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, we are,\" he answered, tenderly. \"And it is best that you\nshould know. I have driven out all the water possible, and we cannot\npump at this depth. Higher up we could. But I can eject the torpedo\nfrom the tube, and perhaps the others. That will lighten us a good\ndeal.\"\n\nHe went forward, driving Foster before him--for he did not care to leave\nhim too close to the girl--and pushed him bodily into the cramped space\nbetween the tube and the trimming tanks.\n\n\"Stay there,\" he said, incisively, \"until I want you.\"\n\n\"What can I do?\" whimpered the photographer, a brave bully before the\ngirl, when safe; a stricken poltroon now. \"I'll do anything you say, to\nget to the surface.\"\n\n\"You'll get to the surface in time,\" answered Ross, significantly. \"How\nmuch do you weigh?\"\n\n\"Two hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"Two hundred more than we want. However, I'll get rid of this torpedo.\"\n\nRoss drove the water out of the tube, opened the breech-door; and,\nreaching in with a long, heavy wire, lifted the starting lever and water\ntripper that gave motion to the torpedo's engine. The exhaust of air\ninto the tube was driven out into the boat by the rapidly moving screws,\nand in a few moments the engine ran down.\n\nThen Ross closed the door, flooded the tube, opened the forward door, or\nport, and sent out the torpedo, confident that, with a dead engine, it\nwould float harmlessly to the surface, and perhaps locate their position\nto the fleet; for there could be little doubt that the harbor above was\ndotted with boats, dragging for the sunken submarine.\n\nAs the torpedo went out, Ross noticed that the nose of the boat lifted a\nlittle, then settled as the tube filled with water. This was\nencouraging, and he expelled the water. The nose again lifted, but the\nstern still held to the bottom. There were two other torpedoes, one\neach side, amidships, and though the dragging to the tube of these heavy\nweights was a job for all hands, Ross essayed it.\n\nThey were mounted on trucks, and with what mechanical aids and purchases\nhe could bring to bear, he and the subdued Foster labored at the task,\nand in an hour had the starboard torpedo in the tube.\n\nAs he was expending weights, he did not take into the 'midship tank an\nequal weight of water, as was usual to keep the boat in trim, and when\nthe torpedo, robbed of motive power and detonator, went out, the bow\nlifted still higher, though the stern held, as was evidenced by the\ngrating sound from aft. The tide was drifting the boat along the bottom.\n\nAnother hour of hard, perspiring work rid them of the other torpedo, and\nthe boat now inclined at an angle of thirty degrees, down by the stern\nbecause of the water in the engine room, but not yet at the critical\nangle that caused the flooding of the after battery jars as the boat\nsank.\n\nRoss looked at the depth indicator, but found small comfort. It read off\na depth of about sixty feet, but this only meant the lift of the bow.\nHowever, the propeller guard only occasionally struck the bottom now,\nproving to Ross that, could he expend a very little more weight, the\nboat would rise to the surface, where, even though he might not pump,\nhis periscope and conning-tower could be seen. He panted after his\nlabors until he had regained breath, then said to Foster:\n\n\"You next.\"\n\n\"I next? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You want to get to the surface, don't you?\" said Ross, grimly. \"You\nexpressed yourself as willing to do anything I might say, in order to\nget to the surface. Well, strip off your coat, vest, and shoes, and\ncrawl into that tube.\"\n\n\"What? To drown? No, I will not.\"\n\n\"Yes, you will. Can you swim?\"\n\n\"I can swim, but not when I am shot out of a gun.\"\n\n\"Then you'll drown. Peel off.\"\n\n\"I cannot. I cannot. Would you kill me?\"\n\n\"Don't care much,\" answered Ross, quietly, \"if I do. Only I don't want\nyour dead body in the boat. Come, now,\" he added, his voice rising. \"I'm\ngiving you a chance for your life. I can swim, too, and would not\nhesitate at going out that tube, if I were sure that the boat, deprived\nof my weight, would rise. But I am not sure, so I send you, not only\nbecause you are heavier than I, but because, as Miss Fleming must\nremain, I prefer to remain, too, to live or die with her. Understand?\"\n\n\"But, Miss Fleming,\" cackled Foster. \"She can swim. I've heard her say\nso.\"\n\n\"You cowardly scoundrel,\" said Ross, his eyes ablaze with scorn and\nrage. He had already shed his coat and vest. Now he rolled up his\nshirt-sleeves. \"Will you go into that tube of your own volition,\nconscious, so that you may take a long breath before I flood the tube,\nor unconscious, and pushed in like a bag of meal, to drown before you\nknow what ails you--which?\"\n\n\"No,\" shrieked Foster, as the menacing face and fists of Ross drew close\nto him. \"I will not. Do something else. You are a sailor. You know what\nto do. Do something else.\"\n\nRoss' reply was a crashing blow in the face, that sent Foster reeling\ntoward the tube. But he arose, and returned, the animal fear in him\nchanged to courage. He was a powerfully built man, taller, broader, and\nheavier than Ross, and what he lacked in skill with his fists, he\npossessed in the momentum of his lunges, and his utter indifference to\npain.\n\nRoss was a trained boxer, strong, and agile, and where he struck the\nlarger man he left his mark; but in the contracted floor space of the\nsubmarine he was at a disadvantage. But he fought on, striking, ducking,\nand dodging--striving not only for his own life, but that of the girl\nwhom he loved, who, seated on the 'midship trimming tank, was watching\nthe fight with pale face and wide-open, frightened eyes.\n\nOnce, Ross managed to trip him as he lunged, and Foster fell headlong;\nbut before Ross could secure a weapon or implement to aid him in the\nunequal combat, he was up and coming back, with nose bleeding and\nswollen, eyes blackened and half closed, and contusions plentifully\nsprinkled over his whole face.\n\nHe growled incoherently; he was reduced by fear and pain to the level of\na beast, and, beast-like, he fought for his life--with hands and feet,\nonly the possession of the prehensile thumb, perhaps, preventing him\nfrom using his teeth; for Ross, unable to avoid his next blind lunge,\nwent down, with the whole two hundred pounds of Foster on top of him,\nand felt the stricture of his clutch on his throat.\n\nA man being choked quickly loses power of volition, entirely distinct\nfrom the inhibition coming of suppressed breathing; after a few moments,\nhis movements are involuntary.\n\nRoss, with flashes of light before his eyes, soon took his hands from\nthe iron fingers at his throat, and, with the darkening of his\nfaculties, his arms and legs went through flail-like motions, rising and\nfalling, thumping the deck with rhythmic regularity.\n\nSomething in this exhibition must have affected the girl at the air jet;\nfor Ross soon began to breathe convulsively, then to see more or less\ndistinctly--while his limbs ceased their flapping--and the first thing\nhe saw was the girl standing over him, her face white as the whites of\nher distended eyes, her lips pressed tightly together, and poised aloft\nin her hands one of the pump-brakes, ready for another descent upon the\nhead of Foster, who, still and inert, lay by the side of Ross.\n\nAs Ross moved and endeavored to rise, she dropped the club, and sank\ndown, crying his name and kissing him. Then she incontinently fainted.\n\nRoss struggled to his feet, and, though still weak and nerveless, found\nsome spun yarn in a locker, with which he tied the unconscious victim's\nhands behind his back, and lashed his ankles together. Thus secured, he\nwas harmless when he came to his senses, which happened before Ross had\nrevived the girl. But there were no growling threats coming from him\nnow; conquered and bound, his courage changed to fear again, and he\ncomplained and prayed for release.\n\n\"Not much,\" said Ross, busy with the girl. \"When I get my wind, I'm\ngoing to jam you into that tube, like a dead man. I'll release you\ninside.\"\n\nWhen Miss Fleming was again seated on the tank, breathing fresh air from\nthe jet, Ross went to work with the practical methods of a sailor. He\nfirst, by a mighty exercise of all his strength, loaded the frightened\nFoster on to one of the torpedo trucks, face downward; then he wheeled\nhim to the tube, so that his uplifted face could look squarely into it;\nthen he passed a strap of rope around under his shoulders, to which he\napplied the big end of a ship's handspike, that happened to be aboard;\nand to the other end of this, as it lay along the back of Foster, he\nsecured the single block of a small tackle--one of the purchases he had\nused in handling the torpedoes--and when he had secured the double block\nto an eyebolt in the bow, he steadied the handspike between his knees,\nhauled on the fall, with no word to the screaming wretch, and launched\nhim, head and shoulders, into the tube.\n\nAs his hands, tied behind him, went in, Ross carefully cut one turn of\nthe spun yarn, hauled away, and as his feet disappeared, he cut the\nbonds on his ankles; then he advised him to shake his hands and feet\nclear, pulled out the handspike, slammed the breech-door to, and waited.\n\nThe protest from within had never ceased; but at last Ross got from the\ninformation, interlarded with pleadings for life, that his hands and\nfeet were free.\n\n\"All right. Take a good breath, and I'll flood you,\" called Ross. \"When\nyou're outside, swim up.\" The voice from within ceased.\n\nRoss threw over the lever that admitted water to the tube, opened the\nforward door, and applied the compressed air. There was a slight jump to\nthe boat's nose, but with the inrush of water as Foster went out, it\nsank.\n\nHowever, when Ross closed the forward door, and had expelled this water,\nit rose again, and he anxiously inspected the depth indicator.\n\nAt first, he hardly dared believe it, but in a few moments he was sure.\nThe indicator was moving, hardly faster than the minute hand of a clock.\nThe boat, released of the last few pounds necessary, was seeking the\nsurface.\n\n\"Irene,\" he shouted, joyously, \"we're rising. We'll be afloat before\nlong, and they'll rescue us. Even though we can't pump, they'll see our\nperiscope, and tow us somewhere where they can lift the hatch out of\nwater. It's all over, girl--all over but the shouting. Stand up, and\nlook at the indicator. Only fifty-five feet now.\"\n\nShe stood beside him, supported by his arm, and together they watched\nthe slowly moving indicator. Then Ross casually glanced at the\ndeadlight, and violently forced the girl to her seat.\n\n\"Sit still,\" he commanded, almost harshly. \"Sit still, and rest.\"\n\nFor, looking in through the deadlight, was the white face of Foster,\nwashed clean of blood, but filled with the terror and agony of the\ndying. His hands clutched weakly at the glass, his eyes closed, his\nmouth opened, and he drifted out of sight.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    Minor typographical errors have been corrected without note.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":122,"split":"train"}
