Pierre works as a doctor, and Jean is a lawyer. It recounts the story of a middle-class French family whose lives are changed when L\u00e9on Mar\u00e9chal, a deceased family friend, leaves his inheritance to Jean. This provokes Pierre to doubt the fidelity of his mother and the legitimacy of his brother. Pierre discovers that his theories about his brother's illegitimacy are correct when he finds and reads old letters that his mother and L\u00e9on Marechal had been sending to each other. This investigation sparks violent reactions in Pierre, whose external appearance vis a vis his mother visibly changes. In his anguish, most notably shown during family meals, he tortures her with allusions to the past that he has now uncovered. Meanwhile, Jean's career and love life improve over the course of the novel while Pierre's life gets significantly worse. Provoked by his brother's accusations of jealousy, Pierre reveals to Jean what he has learned. However, unlike Pierre, Jean offers his mother love and protection. The novel closes with Pierre\u2019s departure on an oceanliner. Thus the novel is organised around the unwelcome appearance of a truth (Jean\u2019s illegitimacy), its suppression for the sake of family continuity and the acquisition of wealth, and the expulsion from the family of the legitimate son.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Pierre and Jean, by Guy de Maupassant\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Roland, dozing in the stern by the side of Mme. Rosemilly, who had\nbeen invited to join the fishing-party, woke up, and turning her head to\nlook at her husband, said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well! Gerome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the old fellow replied in a fury:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey do not bite at all. I have taken nothing since noon. Only men\nshould ever go fishing. Women always delay the start till it is too\nlate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis two sons, Pierre and Jean, who each held a line twisted round his\nforefinger, one to port and one to starboard, both began to laugh, and\nJean remarked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are not very polite to our guest, father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nM. Roland was abashed, and apologized.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon, Mme. Rosemilly, but that is just like me. I invite\nladies because I like to be with them, and then, as soon as I feel the\nwater beneath me, I think of nothing but the fish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Roland was now quite awake, and gazing with a softened look at the\nwide horizon of cliff and sea.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have had good sport, all the same,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured.\n\nBut her husband shook his head in denial, though at the same time he\nglanced complacently at the basket where the fish caught by the three\nmen were still breathing spasmodically, with a low rustle of clammy\nscales and struggling fins, and dull, ineffectual efforts, gasping in\nthe fatal air. Old Roland took the basket between his knees and tilted\nit up, making the silver heap of creatures slide to the edge that he\nmight see those lying at the bottom, and their death-throes became more\nconvulsive, while the strong smell of their bodies, a wholesome reek\nof brine, came up from the full depths of the creel. The old fisherman\nsniffed it eagerly, as we smell at roses, and exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCristi! But they are fresh enough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many did you\npull out, doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis eldest son, Pierre, a man of thirty, with black whiskers trimmed\nsquare like a lawyer's, his mustache and beard shaved away, replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, not many; three or four.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe father turned to the younger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you, Jean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\nJean, a tall fellow, much younger than his brother, fair, with a full\nbeard, smiled and murmured:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch the same as Pierre--four or five.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEvery time they told the same fib, which delighted father Roland. He had\nhitched his line round a row-lock, and folding his arms he announced:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will never again try to fish after noon. After ten in the morning it\nis all over. The lazy brutes will not bite; they are taking their siesta\nin the sun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he looked round at the sea on all sides, with the\nsatisfied air of a proprietor.\n\nHe was a retired jeweller who had been led by an inordinate love of\nseafaring and fishing to fly from the shop as soon as he had made enough\nmoney to live in modest comfort on the interest of his savings. He\nretired to le Havre, bought a boat, and became an amateur skipper.\nHis two sons, Pierre and Jean, had remained at Paris to continue their\nstudies, and came for the holidays from time to time to share their\nfather's amusements.\n\nOn leaving school, Pierre, the elder, five years older than Jean, had\nfelt a vocation to various professions and had tried half a dozen in\nsuccession, but, soon disgusted with each in turn, he started afresh\nwith new hopes. Medicine had been his last fancy, and he had set to work\nwith so much ardour that he had just qualified after an unusually short\ncourse of study, by a special remission of time from the minister. He\nwas enthusiastic, intelligent, fickle, but obstinate, full of Utopias\nand philosophical notions.\n\nJean, who was as fair as his brother was dark, as deliberate as his\nbrother was vehement, as gentle as his brother was unforgiving, had\nquietly gone through his studies for the law and had just taken his\ndiploma as a licentiate, at the time when Pierre had taken his in\nmedicine. So they were now having a little rest at home, and both looked\nforward to settling in Havre if they could find a satisfactory opening.\n\nBut a vague jealousy, one of those dormant jealousies which grow up\nbetween brothers or sisters and slowly ripen till they burst, on the\noccasion of a marriage perhaps, or of some good fortune happening to\none of them, kept them on the alert in a sort of brotherly and\nnon-aggressive animosity. They were fond of each other, it is true, but\nthey watched each other. Pierre, five years old when Jean was born,\nhad looked with the eyes of a little petted animal at that other little\nanimal which had suddenly come to lie in his father's and mother's arms\nand to be loved and fondled by them. Jean, from his birth, had always\nbeen a pattern of sweetness, gentleness, and good temper, and Pierre had\nby degrees begun to chafe at ever-lastingly hearing the praises of this\ngreat lad, whose sweetness in his eyes was indolence, whose gentleness\nwas stupidity, and whose kindliness was blindness. His parents, whose\ndream for their sons was some respectable and undistinguished calling,\nblamed him for so often changing his mind, for his fits of enthusiasm,\nhis abortive beginnings, and all his ineffectual impulses towards\ngenerous ideas and the liberal professions.\n\nSince he had grown to manhood they no longer said in so many words:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at Jean and follow his example,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but every time he heard them say\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJean did this--Jean does that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he understood their meaning and the\nhint the words conveyed.\n\nTheir mother, an orderly person, a thrifty and rather sentimental woman\nof the middle class, with the soul of a soft-hearted book-keeper, was\nconstantly quenching the little rivalries between her two big sons\nto which the petty events of their life constantly gave rise. Another\nlittle circumstance, too, just now disturbed her peace of mind, and\nshe was in fear of some complications; for in the course of the winter,\nwhile her boys were finishing their studies, each in his own line, she\nhad made the acquaintance of a neighbour, Mme. Rosemilly, the widow of a\ncaptain of a merchantman who had died at sea two years before. The young\nwidow--quite young, only three-and-twenty--a woman of strong intellect\nwho knew life by instinct as the free animals do, as though she\nhad seen, gone through, understood, and weighted every conceivable\ncontingency, and judged them with a wholesome, strict, and benevolent\nmind, had fallen into the habit of calling to work or chat for an hour\nin the evening with these friendly neighbours, who would give her a cup\nof tea.\n\nFather Roland, always goaded on by his seafaring craze, would question\ntheir new friend about the departed captain; and she would talk of him,\nand his voyages, and his old-world tales, without hesitation, like a\nresigned and reasonable woman who loves life and respects death.\n\nThe two sons on their return, finding the pretty widow quite at home in\nthe house, forthwith began to court her, less from any wish to charm her\nthan from the desire to cut each other out.\n\nTheir mother, being practical and prudent, sincerely hoped that one of\nthem might win the young widow, for she was rich; but then she would\nhave liked that the other should not be grieved.\n\nMme. Rosemilly was fair, with blue eyes, a mass of light waving hair,\nfluttering at the least breath of wind, and an alert, daring, pugnacious\nlittle way with her, which did not in the least answer to the sober\nmethod of her mind.\n\nShe already seemed to like Jean best, attracted, no doubt, by an\naffinity of nature. This preference, however, she betrayed only by\nan almost imperceptible difference of voice and look and also by\noccasionally asking his opinion. She seemed to guess that Jean's\nviews would support her own, while those of Pierre must inevitably\nbe different. When she spoke of the doctor's ideas on politics, art,\nphilosophy, or morals, she would sometimes say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour crotchets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then\nhe would look at her with the cold gleam of an accuser drawing up an\nindictment against women--all women, poor weak things.\n\nNever till his sons came home had M. Roland invited her to join his\nfishing expeditions, nor had he ever taken his wife; for he liked to put\noff before daybreak, with his ally, Captain Beausire, a master mariner\nretired, whom he had first met on the quay at high tides and with whom\nhe had struck up an intimacy, and the old sailor Papagris, known as Jean\nBart, in whose charge the boat was left.\n\nBut one evening of the week before, Mme. Rosemilly, who had been dining\nwith them, remarked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be great fun to go out fishing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\njeweller, flattered by her interest and suddenly fired with the wish\nto share his favourite sport with her, and to make a convert after the\nmanner of priests, exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you like to come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure I should.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext Tuesday?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, next Tuesday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you the woman to be ready to start at five in the morning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe exclaimed in horror:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, indeed: that is too much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was disappointed and chilled, suddenly doubting her true vocation.\nHowever, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt what hour can you be ready?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell--at nine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot before?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not before. Even that is very early.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old fellow hesitated; he certainly would catch nothing, for when the\nsun has warmed the sea the fish bite no more; but the two brothers had\neagerly pressed the scheme, and organized and arranged everything there\nand then.\n\nSo on the following Tuesday the Pearl had dropped anchor under the white\nrocks of Cape la Heve; they had fished till midday, then they had slept\nawhile, and then fished again without catching anything; and then it\nwas that father Roland, perceiving, rather late, that all that Mme.\nRosemilly really enjoyed and cared for was the sail on the sea, and\nseeing that his lines hung motionless, had uttered in a spirit of\nunreasonable annoyance, that vehement \u00e2\u0080\u009cTschah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which applied as much to\nthe pathetic widow as to the creatures he could not catch.\n\nNow he contemplated the spoil--his fish--with the joyful thrill of a\nmiser; seeing as he looked up at the sky that the sun was getting low:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, boys,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009csuppose we turn homeward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young men hauled in their lines, coiled them up, cleaned the hooks\nand stuck them into corks, and sat waiting.\n\nRoland stood up to look out like a captain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo wind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will have to pull, young 'uns.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd suddenly extending one arm to the northward, he exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere comes the packet from Southampton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAway over the level sea, spread out like a blue sheet, vast and sheeny\nand shot with flame and gold, an inky cloud was visible against the rosy\nsky in the quarter to which he pointed, and below it they could make out\nthe hull of the steamer, which looked tiny at such a distance. And to\nsouthward other wreaths of smoke, numbers of them, could be seen, all\nconverging towards the Havre pier, now scarcely visible as a white\nstreak with the lighthouse, upright, like a horn, at the end of it.\n\nRoland asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs not the Normandie due to-day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Jean replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, to-day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me my glass. I fancy I see her out there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe father pulled out the copper tube, adjusted it to his eye, sought\nthe speck, and then, delighted to have seen it, exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, there she is. I know her two funnels. Would you like to look,\nMme. Rosemilly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took the telescope and directed it towards the Atlantic horizon,\nwithout being able, however, to find the vessel, for she could\ndistinguish nothing--nothing but blue, with a coloured halo round it, a\ncircular rainbow--and then all manner of queer things, winking eclipses\nwhich made her feel sick.\n\nShe said as she returned the glass:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never could see with that thing. It used to put my husband in quite a\nrage; he would stand for hours at the windows watching the ships pass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Roland, much put out, retorted:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it must be some defect in your eye, for my glass is a very good\none.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he offered it to his wife.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you like to look?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, thank you. I know before hand that I could not see through it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Roland, a woman of eight-and-forty but who did not look it, seemed\nto be enjoying this excursion and this waning day more than any of the\nparty.\n\nHer chestnut hair was only just beginning to show streaks of white. She\nhad a calm, reasonable face, a kind and happy way with her which it\nwas a pleasure to see. Her son Pierre was wont to say that she knew the\nvalue of money, but this did not hinder her from enjoying the delights\nof dreaming. She was fond of reading, of novels, and poetry, not for\ntheir value as works of art, but for the sake of the tender melancholy\nmood they would induce in her. A line of poetry, often but a poor one,\noften a bad one, would touch the little chord, as she expressed it, and\ngive her the sense of some mysterious desire almost realized. And she\ndelighted in these faint emotions which brought a little flutter to her\nsoul, otherwise as strictly kept as a ledger.\n\nSince settling at Havre she had become perceptibly stouter, and her\nfigure, which had been very supple and slight, had grown heavier.\n\nThis day on the sea had been delightful to her. Her husband, without\nbeing brutal, was rough with her, as a man who is the despot of his\nshop is apt to be rough, without anger or hatred; to such men to give an\norder is to swear. He controlled himself in the presence of strangers,\nbut in private he let loose and gave himself terrible vent, though he\nwas himself afraid of every one. She, in sheer horror of the turmoil,\nof scenes, of useless explanations, always gave way and never asked for\nanything; for a very long time she had not ventured to ask Roland to\ntake her out in the boat. So she had joyfully hailed this opportunity,\nand was keenly enjoying the rare and new pleasure.\n\nFrom the moment when they started she surrendered herself completely,\nbody and soul, to the soft, gliding motion over the waves. She was not\nthinking; her mind was not wandering through either memories or hopes;\nit seemed to her as though her heart, like her body, was floating on\nsomething soft and liquid and delicious which rocked and lulled it.\n\nWhen their father gave the word to return, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, take your places at\nthe oars!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she smiled to see her sons, her two great boys, take off\ntheir jackets and roll up their shirt-sleeves on their bare arms.\n\nPierre, who was nearest to the two women, took the stroke oar, Jean the\nother, and they sat waiting till the skipper should say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive way!\u00e2\u0080\u009d For\nhe insisted on everything being done according to strict rule.\n\nSimultaneously, as if by a single effort, they dipped the oars, and\nlying back, pulling with all their might, began a struggle to display\ntheir strength. They had come out easily, under sail, but the breeze\nhad died away, and the masculine pride of the two brothers was suddenly\naroused by the prospect of measuring their powers. When they went out\nalone with their father they plied the oars without any steering, for\nRoland would be busy getting the lines ready, while he kept a lookout in\nthe boat's course, guiding it by a sign or a word: \u00e2\u0080\u009cEasy, Jean, and you,\nPierre, put your back into it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or he would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, then, number\none; come, number two--a little elbow grease.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then the one who had been\ndreaming pulled harder, the one who had got excited eased down, and the\nboat's head came round.\n\nBut to-day they meant to display their biceps. Pierre's arms were hairy,\nsomewhat lean but sinewy; Jean's were round and white and rosy, and the\nknot of muscles moved under the skin.\n\nAt first Pierre had the advantage. With his teeth set, his brow knit,\nhis legs rigid, his hands clinched on the oar, he made it bend from\nend to end at every stroke, and the Pearl was veering landward. Father\nRoland, sitting in the bows, so as to leave the stern seat to the two\nwomen, wasted his breath shouting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEasy, number one; pull harder,\nnumber two!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pierre pulled harder in his frenzy, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cnumber two\u00e2\u0080\u009d could\nnot keep time with his wild stroke.\n\nAt last the skipper cried: \u00e2\u0080\u009cStop her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The two oars were lifted\nsimultaneously, and then by his father's orders Jean pulled alone for\na few minutes. But from that moment he had it all his own way; he grew\neager and warmed to his work, while Pierre, out of breath and exhausted\nby his first vigorous spurt, was lax and panting. Four times running\nfather Roland made them stop while the elder took breath, so as to get\nthe boat into her right course again. Then the doctor, humiliated and\nfuming, his forehead dropping with sweat, his cheeks white, stammered\nout:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot think what has come over me; I have a stitch in my side. I\nstarted very well, but it has pulled me up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShall I pull alone with both oars for a time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, thanks, it will go off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd their mother, somewhat vexed, said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Pierre, what rhyme or reason is there in getting into such a\nstate. You are not a child.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he shrugged his shoulders and set to once more.\n\nMme. Rosemilly pretended not to see, not to understand, not to hear.\nHer fair head went back with an engaging little jerk every time the boat\nmoved forward, making the fine wayward hairs flutter about her temples.\n\nBut father Roland presently called out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, the Prince Albert is catching us up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey all looked round. Long and low in the water, with her two\nraking funnels and two yellow paddle-boxes like two round cheeks,\nthe Southampton packet came ploughing on at full steam, crowded with\npassengers under open parasols. Its hurrying, noisy paddle-wheels\nbeating up the water which fell again in foam, gave it an appearance of\nhaste as of a courier pressed for time, and the upright stem cut through\nthe water, throwing up two thin translucent waves which glided off along\nthe hull.\n\nWhen it had come quite near the Pearl, father Roland lifted his hat,\nthe ladies shook their handkerchiefs, and half a dozen parasols eagerly\nwaved on board the steamboat responded to this salute as she went on her\nway, leaving behind her a few broad undulations on the still and glassy\nsurface of the sea.\n\nThere were other vessels, each with its smoky cap, coming in from every\npart of the horizon towards the short white jetty, which swallowed them\nup, one after another, like a mouth. And the fishing barks and lighter\ncraft with broad sails and slender masts, stealing across the sky in tow\nof inconspicuous tugs, were coming in, faster and slower, towards the\ndevouring ogre, who from time to time seemed to have had a surfeit, and\nspewed out to the open sea another fleet of steamers, brigs, schooners,\nand three-masted vessels with their tangled mass of rigging. The\nhurrying steamships flew off to the right and left over the smooth bosom\nof the ocean, while sailing vessels, cast off by the pilot-tugs which\nhad hauled them out, lay motionless, dressing themselves from the\nmain-mast to the fore-tops in canvas, white or brown, and ruddy in the\nsetting sun.\n\nMme. Roland, with her eyes half-shut, murmured: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood heavens, how\nbeautiful the sea is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Mme. Rosemilly replied with a long sigh, which, however, had no\nsadness in it:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, but it is sometimes very cruel, all the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, there is the Normandie just going in. A big ship, isn't she?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he described the coast opposite, far, far away, on the other side\nof the mouth of the Seine--that mouth extended over twenty kilometres,\nsaid he. He pointed out Villerville, Trouville, Houlgate, Luc,\nArromanches, the little river of Caen, and the rocks of Calvados which\nmake the coast unsafe as far as Cherbourg. Then he enlarged on the\nquestion of the sand-banks in the Seine, which shift at every tide so\nthat even the pilots of Quilleboeuf are at fault if they do not survey\nthe channel every day. He bid them notice how the town of Havre divided\nUpper from Lower Normandy. In Lower Normandy the shore sloped down\nto the sea in pasture-lands, fields, and meadows. The coast of Upper\nNormandy, on the contrary, was steep, a high cliff, ravined, cleft and\ntowering, forming an immense white rampart all the way to Dunkirk,\nwhile in each hollow a village or a port lay hidden: Etretat, Fecamp,\nSaint-Valery, Treport, Dieppe, and the rest.\n\nThe two women did not listen. Torpid with comfort and impressed by the\nsight of the ocean covered with vessels rushing to and fro like wild\nbeasts about their den, they sat speechless, somewhat awed by the\nsoothing and gorgeous sunset. Roland alone talked on without end; he\nwas one of those whom nothing can disturb. Women, whose nerves are\nmore sensitive, sometimes feel, without knowing why, that the sound of\nuseless speech is as irritating as an insult.\n\nPierre and Jean, who had calmed down, were rowing slowly, and the Pearl\nwas making for the harbour, a tiny thing among those huge vessels.\n\nWhen they came alongside of the quay, Papagris, who was waiting there,\ngave his hand to the ladies to help them out, and they took the way into\nthe town. A large crowd, the crowd which haunts the pier every day at\nhigh tide--was also drifting homeward. Mme. Roland and Mme. Rosemilly\nled the way, followed by the three men. As they went up the Rue de Paris\nthey stopped now and then in front of a milliner's or a jeweller's shop,\nto look at a bonnet or an ornament; then after making their comments\nthey went on again. In front of the Place de la Bourse Roland paused, as\nhe did every day, to gaze at the docks full of vessels--the _Bassin du\nCommerce_, with other docks beyond, where the huge hulls lay side by\nside, closely packed in rows, four or five deep. And masts innumerable;\nalong several kilometres of quays the endless masts, with their yards,\npoles, and rigging, gave this great gap in the heart of the town\nthe look of a dead forest. Above this leafless forest the gulls were\nwheeling, and watching to pounce, like a falling stone, on any scraps\nflung overboard; a sailor boy, fixing a pulley to a cross-beam, looked\nas if he had gone up there bird's-nesting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you dine with us without any sort of ceremony, just that we may\nend the day together?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mme. Roland to her friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure I will, with pleasure; I accept equally without ceremony. It\nwould be dismal to go home and be alone this evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre, who had heard, and who was beginning to be restless under the\nyoung woman's indifference, muttered to himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, the widow is\ntaking root now, it would seem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For some days past he had spoken of her\nas \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe widow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The word, harmless in itself, irritated Jean merely by\nthe tone given to it, which to him seemed spiteful and offensive.\n\nThe three men spoke not another word till they reached the threshold of\ntheir own house. It was a narrow one, consisting of a ground-floor and\ntwo floors above, in the Rue Belle-Normande. The maid, Josephine, a girl\nof nineteen, a rustic servant-of-all-work at low wages, gifted to excess\nwith the startled animal expression of a peasant, opened the door, went\nup stairs at her master's heels to the drawing-room, which was on the\nfirst floor, and then said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA gentleman called--three times.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Roland, who never spoke to her without shouting and swearing, cried\nout:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho do you say called, in the devil's name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe never winced at her master's roaring voice, and replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA gentleman from the lawyer's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat lawyer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, M'sieu 'Canu--who else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what did this gentleman say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat M'sieu 'Canu will call in himself in the course of the evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaitre Lecanu was M. Roland's lawyer, and in a way his friend, managing\nhis business for him. For him to send word that he would call in the\nevening, something urgent and important must be in the wind; and the\nfour Rolands looked at each other, disturbed by the announcement as\nfolks of small fortune are wont to be at any intervention of a lawyer,\nwith its suggestions of contracts, inheritance, lawsuits--all sorts of\ndesirable or formidable contingencies. The father, after a few moments\nof silence, muttered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat on earth can it mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Rosemilly began to laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, a legacy, of course. I am sure of it. I bring good luck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut they did not expect the death of any one who might leave them\nanything.\n\nMme. Roland, who had a good memory for relationships, began to think\nover all their connections on her husband's side and on her own, to\ntrace up pedigrees and the ramifications of cousin-ship.\n\nBefore even taking off her bonnet she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, father\u00e2\u0080\u009d (she called her husband \u00e2\u0080\u009cfather\u00e2\u0080\u009d at home, and sometimes\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur Roland\u00e2\u0080\u009d before strangers), \u00e2\u0080\u009ctell me, do you remember who it\nwas that Joseph Lebru married for the second time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes--a little girl named Dumenil, a stationer's daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHad they any children?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think so! four or five at least.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot from that quarter, then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was quite eager already in her search; she caught at the hope of\nsome added ease dropping from the sky. But Pierre, who was very fond of\nhis mother, who knew her to be somewhat visionary and feared she might\nbe disappointed, a little grieved, a little saddened if the news were\nbad instead of good, checked her:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not get excited, mother; there is no rich American uncle. For my\npart, I should sooner fancy that it is about a marriage for Jean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEvery one was surprised at the suggestion, and Jean was a little ruffled\nby his brother's having spoken of it before Mme. Rosemilly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why for me rather than for you? The hypothesis is very disputable.\nYou are the elder; you, therefore, would be the first to be thought of.\nBesides, I do not wish to marry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre smiled sneeringly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you in love, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the other, much put out, retorted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it necessary that a man\nshould be in love because he does not care to marry yet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, there you are! That 'yet' sets it right; you are waiting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGranted that I am waiting, if you will have it so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut old Roland, who had been listening and cogitating, suddenly hit upon\nthe most probable solution.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBless me! what fools we are to be racking our brains. Maitre Lecanu is\nour very good friend; he knows that Pierre is looking out for a medical\npartnership and Jean for a lawyer's office, and he has found something\nto suit one of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was so obvious and likely that every one accepted it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDinner is ready,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the maid. And they all hurried off to their\nrooms to wash their hands before sitting down to table.\n\nTen minutes later they were at dinner in the little dining-room on the\nground-floor.\n\nAt first they were silent; but presently Roland began again in amazement\nat this lawyer's visit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor after all, why did he not write? Why should he have sent his clerk\nthree times? Why is he coming himself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre thought it quite natural.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn immediate decision is required, no doubt; and perhaps there are\ncertain confidential conditions which it does not do to put into\nwriting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStill, they were all puzzled, and all four a little annoyed at having\ninvited a stranger, who would be in the way of their discussing and\ndeciding on what should be done.\n\nThey had just gone upstairs again when the lawyer was announced. Roland\nflew to meet him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-evening, my dear Maitre,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, giving his visitor the title\nwhich in France is the official prefix to the name of every lawyer.\n\nMme. Rosemilly rose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am going,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very tired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA faint attempt was made to detain her; but she would not consent, and\nwent home without either of the three men offering to escort her, as\nthey always had done.\n\nMme. Roland did the honours eagerly to their visitor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA cup of coffee, monsieur?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, thank you. I have just had dinner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA cup of tea, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, I will accept one later. First we must attend to business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe deep silence which succeeded this remark was broken only by the\nregular ticking of the clock, and below stairs the clatter of saucepans\nwhich the girl was cleaning--too stupid even to listen at the door.\n\nThe lawyer went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you, in Paris, know a certain M. Marechal--Leon Marechal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nM. and Mme. Roland both exclaimed at once: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think so!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was a friend of yours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur best friend, monsieur, but a fanatic for Paris;\nnever to be got away from the boulevard. He was a head clerk in the\nexchequer office. I have never seen him since I left the capital, and\nlatterly we had ceased writing to each other. When people are far apart\nyou know----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lawyer gravely put in:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cM. Marechal is deceased.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBoth man and wife responded with the little movement of pained surprise,\ngenuine or false, but always ready, with which such news is received.\n\nMaitre Lecanu went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy colleague in Paris has just communicated to me the main item of his\nwill, by which he makes your son Jean--Monsieur Jean Roland--his sole\nlegatee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey were all too much amazed to utter a single word. Mme. Roland was\nthe first to control her emotion and stammered out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood heavens! Poor Leon--our poor friend! Dear me! Dear me! Dead!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe tears started to her eyes, a woman's silent tears, drops of grief\nfrom her very soul, which trickle down her cheeks and seem so very sad,\nbeing so clear. But Roland was thinking less of the loss than of the\nprospect announced. Still, he dared not at once inquire into the clauses\nof the will and the amount of the fortune, so to work round to these\ninteresting facts he asked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what did he die of, poor Marechal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaitre Lecanu did not know in the least.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll I know is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat dying without any direct heirs, he\nhas left the whole of his fortune--about twenty thousand francs a year\n($3,840) in three per cents--to your second son, whom he has known from\nhis birth up, and judges worthy of the legacy. If M. Jean should refuse\nthe money, it is to go to the foundling hospitals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Roland could not conceal his delight and exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSacristi! It is the thought of a kind heart. And if I had had no heir I\nwould not have forgotten him; he was a true friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lawyer smiled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was very glad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto announce the event to you myself. It is\nalways a pleasure to be the bearer of good news.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt had not struck him that this good news was that of the death of a\nfriend, of Roland's best friend; and the old man himself had suddenly\nforgotten the intimacy he had but just spoken of with so much\nconviction.\n\nOnly Mme. Roland and her sons still looked mournful. She, indeed, was\nstill shedding a few tears, wiping her eyes with her handkerchief, which\nshe then pressed to her lips to smother her deep sobs.\n\nThe doctor murmured:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was a good fellow, very affectionate. He often invited us to dine\nwith him--my brother and me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean, with wide-open, glittering eyes, laid his hand on his handsome\nfair beard, a familiar gesture with him, and drew his fingers down it\nto the tip of the last hairs, as if to pull it longer and thinner. Twice\nhis lips parted to utter some decent remark, but after long meditation\nhe could only say this:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, he was certainly fond of me. He would always embrace me when I\nwent to see him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut his father's thoughts had set off at a gallop--galloping round this\ninheritance to come; nay, already in hand; this money lurking behind the\ndoor, which would walk in quite soon, to-morrow, at a word of consent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd there is no possible difficulty in the way?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\nlawsuit--no one to dispute it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaitre Lecanu seemed quite easy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; my Paris correspondent states that everything is quite clear. M.\nJean has only to sign his acceptance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood. Then--then the fortune is quite clear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerfectly clear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the necessary formalities have been gone through?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSuddenly the old jeweller had an impulse of shame--obscure, instinctive,\nand fleeting; shame of his eagerness to be informed, and he added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou understand that I ask all these questions immediately so as to save\nmy son unpleasant consequences which he might not foresee. Sometimes\nthere are debts, embarrassing liabilities, what not! And a legatee finds\nhimself in an inextricable thorn-bush. After all, I am not the heir--but\nI think first of the little 'un.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey were accustomed to speak of Jean among themselves as the \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle\none,\u00e2\u0080\u009d though he was much bigger than Pierre.\n\nSuddenly Mme. Roland seemed to wake from a dream, to recall some remote\nfact, a thing almost forgotten that she had heard long ago, and of which\nshe was not altogether sure. She inquired doubtingly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere you not saying that our poor friend Marechal had left his fortune\nto my little Jean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, madame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she went on simply:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am much pleased to hear it; it proves that he was attached to us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland had risen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd would you wish, my dear sir, that my son should at once sign his\nacceptance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo--no, M. Roland. To-morrow, at my office to-morrow, at two o'clock,\nif that suits you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, to be sure--yes, indeed. I should think so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Mme. Roland, who had also risen and who was smiling after her\ntears, went up to the lawyer, and laying her hand on the back of his\nchair while she looked at him with the pathetic eyes of a grateful\nmother, she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now for that cup of tea, Monsieur Lecanu?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I will accept it with pleasure, madame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe maid, on being summoned, brought in first some dry biscuits in deep\ntin boxes, those crisp, insipid English cakes which seem to have been\nmade for a parrot's beak, and soldered into metal cases for a voyage\nround the world. Next she fetched some little gray linen doilies, folded\nsquare, those tea-napkins which in thrifty families never get washed. A\nthird time she came in with the sugar-basin and cups; then she departed\nto heat the water. They sat waiting.\n\nNo one could talk; they had too much to think about and nothing to\nsay. Mme. Roland alone attempted a few commonplace remarks. She gave an\naccount of the fishing excursion, and sang the praises of the Pearl and\nof Mme. Rosemilly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCharming, charming!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the lawyer said again and again.\n\nRoland, leaning against the marble mantel-shelf as if it were winter and\nthe fire burning, with his hands in his pockets and his lips puckered\nfor a whistle, could not keep still, tortured by the invincible desire\nto give vent to his delight. The two brothers, in two arm-chairs that\nmatched, one on each side of the centre-table, stared in front of them,\nin similar attitudes full of dissimilar expressions.\n\nAt last the tea appeared. The lawyer took a cup, sugared it, and drank\nit, after having crumbled into it a little cake which was too hard to\ncrunch. Then he rose, shook hands, and departed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it is understood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Roland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo-morrow, at your place, at\ntwo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite so. To-morrow, at two.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean had not spoken a word.\n\nWhen their guest had gone, silence fell again till father Roland clapped\nhis two hands on his younger son's shoulders, crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you devilish lucky dog! You don't embrace me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Jean smiled. He embraced his father, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt had not struck me as indispensable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man was beside himself with glee. He walked about the room,\nstrummed on the furniture with his clumsy nails, turned about on his\nheels, and kept saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat luck! What luck! Now, that is really what I call luck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre asked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you used to know this Marechal well?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd his father replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe! Why, he used to spend every evening at our house. Surely you\nremember he used to fetch you from school on half-holidays, and often\ntook you back again after dinner. Why, the very day when Jean was born\nit was he who went for the doctor. He had been breakfasting with us when\nyour mother was taken ill. Of course we knew at once what it meant, and\nhe set off post-haste. In his hurry he took my hat instead of his own. I\nremember that because we had a good laugh over it afterward. It is very\nlikely that he may have thought of that when he was dying, and as he had\nno heir he may have said to himself: 'I remember helping to bring that\nyoungster into the world, so I will leave him my savings.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Roland, sunk in a deep chair, seemed lost in reminiscences once\nmore. She murmured, as though she were thinking aloud:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, he was a good friend, very devoted, very faithful, a rare soul in\nthese days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean got up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall go out for a little walk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nHis father was surprised and tried to keep him; they had much to talk\nabout, plans to be made, decisions to be formed. But the young man\ninsisted, declaring that he had an engagement. Besides, there would be\ntime enough for settling everything before he came into possession of\nhis inheritance. So he went away, for he wished to be alone to reflect.\nPierre, on his part, said that he too was going out, and after a few\nminutes followed his brother.\n\nAs soon as he was alone with his wife, father Roland took her in\nhis arms, kissed her a dozen times on each cheek, and, replying to a\nreproach she had often brought against him, said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, my dearest, that it would have been no good to stay any longer\nin Paris and work for the children till I dropped, instead of coming\nhere to recruit my health, since fortune drops on us from the skies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was quite serious.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt drops from the skies on Jean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Pierre?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPierre? But he is a doctor; he will make plenty of money; besides, his\nbrother will surely do something for him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, he would not take it. Besides, this legacy is for Jean, only for\nJean. Pierre will find himself at a great disadvantage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old fellow seemed perplexed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, we will leave him rather\nmore in our will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; that again would not be quite just.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDrat it all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want me to do in the matter?\nYou always hit on a whole heap of disagreeable ideas. You must spoil all\nmy pleasures. Well, I am going to bed. Good-night. All the same, I call\nit good luck, jolly good luck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he went off, delighted in spite of everything, and without a word of\nregret for the friend so generous in his death.\n\nMme. Roland sat thinking again in front of the lamp which was burning\nout.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAs soon as he got out, Pierre made his way to the Rue de Paris, the\nhigh-street of Havre, brightly lighted up, lively and noisy. The rather\nsharp air of the seacoast kissed his face, and he walked slowly, his\nstick under his arm and his hands behind his back. He was ill at ease,\noppressed, out of heart, as one is after hearing unpleasant tidings.\nHe was not distressed by any definite thought, and he would have been\npuzzled to account, on the spur of the moment, for this dejection of\nspirit and heaviness of limb. He was hurt somewhere, without knowing\nwhere; somewhere within him there was a pin-point of pain--one of those\nalmost imperceptible wounds which we cannot lay a finger on, but which\nincommode us, tire us, depress us, irritate us--a slight and occult\npang, as it were a small seed of distress.\n\nWhen he reached the square in front of the theatre, he was attracted\nby the lights in the Cafe Tortoni, and slowly bent his steps to the\ndazzling facade; but just as he was going in he reflected that he would\nmeet friends there and acquaintances--people he would be obliged to\ntalk to; and fierce repugnance surged up in him for this commonplace\ngood-fellowship over coffee cups and liqueur glasses. So, retracing his\nsteps, he went back to the high-street leading to the harbour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere shall I go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked himself, trying to think of a spot he liked\nwhich would agree with his frame of mind. He could not think of one, for\nbeing alone made him feel fractious, yet he could not bear to meet any\none. As he came out on the Grand Quay he hesitated once more; then he\nturned towards the pier; he had chosen solitude.\n\nGoing close by a bench on the breakwater he sat down, tired already of\nwalking and out of humour with his stroll before he had taken it.\n\nHe said to himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter with me this evening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he\nbegan to search in his memory for what vexation had crossed him, as we\nquestion a sick man to discover the cause of his fever.\n\nHis mind was at once irritable and sober; he got excited, then he\nreasoned, approving or blaming his impulses; but in time primitive\nnature at last proved the stronger; the sensitive man always had the\nupper hand over the intellectual man. So he tried to discover what had\ninduced this irascible mood, this craving to be moving without wanting\nanything, this desire to meet some one for the sake of differing from\nhim, and at the same time this aversion for the people he might see and\nthe things they might say to him.\n\nAnd then he put the question to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan it be Jean's inheritance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYes, it was certainly possible. When the lawyer had announced the news\nhe had felt his heart beat a little faster. For, indeed, one is not\nalways master of one's self; there are sudden and pertinacious emotions\nagainst which a man struggles in vain.\n\nHe fell into meditation on the physiological problem of the impression\nproduced on the instinctive element in man, and giving rise to a current\nof painful or pleasurable sensations diametrically opposed to those\nwhich the thinking man desires, aims at, and regards as right and\nwholesome, when he has risen superior to himself by the cultivation of\nhis intellect. He tried to picture to himself the frame of mind of a son\nwho had inherited a vast fortune, and who, thanks to that wealth, may\nnow know many long-wished-for delights, which the avarice of his father\nhad prohibited--a father, nevertheless, beloved and regretted.\n\nHe got up and walked on to the end of the pier. He felt better, and\nglad to have understood, to have detected himself, to have unmasked _the\nother_ which lurks in us.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I was jealous of Jean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is really vilely mean.\nAnd I am sure of it now, for the first idea which came into my head was\nthat he would marry Mme. Rosemilly. And yet I am not in love myself with\nthat priggish little goose, who is just the woman to disgust a man with\ngood sense and good conduct. So it is the most gratuitous jealousy, the\nvery essence of jealousy, which is merely because it is! I must keep an\neye on that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time he was in front of the flag-staff, whence the depth of\nwater in the harbour is signalled, and he struck a match to read the\nlist of vessels signalled in the roadstead and coming in with the next\nhigh tide. Ships were due from Brazil, from La Plata, from Chili\nand Japan, two Danish brigs, a Norwegian schooner, and a Turkish\nsteamship--which startled Pierre as much as if it had read a Swiss\nsteamship; and in a whimsical vision he pictured a great vessel crowded\nwith men in turbans climbing the shrouds in loose trousers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow absurd!\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the Turks are a maritime people, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA few steps further on he stopped again, looking out at the roads. On\nthe right, above Sainte-Adresse, the two electric lights of Cape la\nHeve, like monstrous twin Cyclops, shot their long and powerful beams\nacross the sea. Starting from two neighbouring centres, the two parallel\nshafts of light, like the colossal tails of two comets, fell in a\nstraight and endless slope from the top of the cliff to the uttermost\nhorizon. Then, on the two piers, two more lights, the children of these\ngiants, marked the entrance to the harbour; and far away on the other\nside of the Seine others were in sight, many others, steady or winking,\nflashing or revolving, opening and shutting like eyes--the eyes of the\nports--yellow, red, and green, watching the night-wrapped sea covered\nwith ships; the living eyes of the hospitable shore saying, merely by\nthe mechanical and regular movement of their eye-lids: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am here. I am\nTrouville; I am Honfleur; I am the Andemer River.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And high above\nall the rest, so high that from this distance it might be taken for a\nplanet, the airy lighthouse of Etouville showed the way to Rouen across\nthe sand banks at the mouth of the great river.\n\nOut on the deep water, the limitless water, darker than the sky, stars\nseemed to have fallen here and there. They twinkled in the night haze,\nsmall, close to shore or far away--white, red, and green, too. Most of\nthem were motionless; some, however, seemed to be scudding onward. These\nwere the lights of the ships at anchor or moving about in search of\nmoorings.\n\nJust at this moment the moon rose behind the town; and it, too, looked\nlike some huge, divine pharos lighted up in the heavens to guide the\ncountless fleet of stars in the sky. Pierre murmured, almost speaking\naloud: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at that! And we let our bile rise for twopence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn a sudden, close to him, in the wide, dark ditch between the two\npiers, a shadow stole up, a large shadow of fantastic shape. Leaning\nover the granite parapet, he saw that a fishing-boat had glided in,\nwithout the sound of a voice or the splash of a ripple, or the plunge\nof an oar, softly borne in by its broad, tawny sail spread to the breeze\nfrom the open sea.\n\nHe thought to himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf one could but live on board that boat, what\npeace it would be--perhaps!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then again a few steps beyond, he saw a man sitting at the very end\nof the breakwater.\n\nA dreamer, a lover, a sage--a happy or a desperate man? Who was it? He\nwent forward, curious to see the face of this lonely individual, and he\nrecognised his brother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, is it you, Jean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPierre! You! What has brought you here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI came out to get some fresh air. And you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean began to laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI too came out for fresh air.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Pierre sat down by his brother's\nside.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLovely--isn't it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, lovely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe understood from the tone of voice that Jean had not looked at\nanything. He went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor my part, whenever I come here I am seized with a wild desire to be\noff with all those boats, to the north or the south. Only to think that\nall those little sparks out there have just come from the uttermost ends\nof the earth, from the lands of great flowers and beautiful olive or\ncopper coloured girls, the lands of humming-birds, of elephants,\nof roaming lions, of negro kings, from all the lands which are like\nfairy-tales to us who no longer believe in the White Cat or the Sleeping\nBeauty. It would be awfully jolly to be able to treat one's self to an\nexcursion out there; but, then, it would cost a great deal of money, no\nend--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe broke off abruptly, remembering that his brother had that money now;\nand released from care, released from labouring for his daily bread,\nfree, unfettered, happy, and light-hearted, he might go whither he\nlisted, to find the fair-haired Swedes or the brown damsels of Havana.\nAnd then one of those involuntary flashes which were common with him, so\nsudden and swift that he could neither anticipate them, nor stop them,\nnor qualify them, communicated, as it seemed to him, from some second,\nindependent, and violent soul, shot through his brain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah! He is too great a simpleton; he will marry that little Rosemilly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n He was standing up now. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will leave you to dream of the future. I want\nto be moving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He grasped his brother's hand and added in a heavy tone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my dear old boy, you are a rich man. I am very glad to have come\nupon you this evening to tell you how pleased I am about it, how truly I\ncongratulate you, and how much I care for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean, tender and soft-hearted, was deeply touched.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, my good brother--thank you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stammered.\n\nAnd Pierre turned away with his slow step, his stick under his arm, and\nhis hands behind his back.\n\nBack in the town again, he once more wondered what he should do, being\ndisappointed of his walk and deprived of the company of the sea by his\nbrother's presence. He had an inspiration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go and take a glass\nof liqueur with old Marowsko,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he went off towards the quarter of\nthe town known as Ingouville.\n\nHe had known old Marowsko-_le pere Marowsko_, he called him--in the\nhospitals in Paris. He was a Pole, an old refugee, it was said, who\nhad gone through terrible things out there, and who had come to ply\nhis calling as a chemist and druggist in France after passing a fresh\nexamination. Nothing was known of his early life, and all sorts of\nlegends had been current among the indoor and outdoor patients\nand afterward among his neighbours. This reputation as a terrible\nconspirator, a nihilist, a regicide, a patriot ready for anything and\neverything, who had escaped death by a miracle, had bewitched Pierre\nRoland's lively and bold imagination; he had made friends with the old\nPole, without, however, having ever extracted from him any revelation as\nto his former career. It was owing to the young doctor that this worthy\nhad come to settle at Havre, counting on the large custom which the\nrising practitioner would secure him. Meanwhile he lived very poorly in\nhis little shop, selling medicines to the small tradesmen and workmen in\nhis part of the town.\n\nPierre often went to see him and chat with him for an hour after dinner,\nfor he liked Marowsko's calm look and rare speech, and attributed great\ndepth to his long spells of silence.\n\nA simple gas-burner was alight over the counter crowded with phials.\nThose in the window were not lighted, from motives of economy. Behind\nthe counter, sitting on a chair with his legs stretched out and\ncrossed, an old man, quite bald, with a large beak of a nose which, as a\nprolongation of his hairless forehead, gave him a melancholy likeness to\na parrot, was sleeping soundly, his chin resting on his breast. He woke\nat the sound of the shop-bell, and recognising the doctor, came forward\nto meet him, holding out both hands.\n\nHis black frock-coat, streaked with stains of acids and sirups, was\nmuch too wide for his lean little person, and looked like a shabby old\ncassock; and the man spoke with a strong Polish accent which gave the\nchildlike character to his thin voice, the lisping note and intonations\nof a young thing learning to speak.\n\nPierre sat down, and Marowsko asked him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat news, dear doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone. Everything as usual, everywhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do not look very gay this evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not often gay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, you must shake that off. Will you try a glass of liqueur?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I do not mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I will give you something new to try. For these two months I have\nbeen trying to extract something from currants, of which only a sirup\nhas been made hitherto--well, and I have done it. I have invented a very\ngood liqueur--very good indeed; very good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd quite delighted, he went to a cupboard, opened it, and picked out\na bottle which he brought forth. He moved and did everything in jerky\ngestures, always incomplete; he never quite stretched out his arm, nor\nquite put out his legs; nor made any broad and definite movements. His\nideas seemed to be like his actions; he suggested them, promised them,\nsketched them, hinted at them, but never fully uttered them.\n\nAnd, indeed, his great end in life seemed to be the concoction of\nsirups and liqueurs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA good sirup or a good liqueur is enough to make a\nfortune,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would often say.\n\nHe had compounded hundreds of these sweet mixtures without ever\nsucceeding in floating one of them. Pierre declared that Marowsko always\nreminded him of Marat.\n\nTwo little glasses were fetched out of the back shop and placed on the\nmixing-board. Then the two men scrutinized the colour of the fluid by\nholding it up to the gas.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA fine ruby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pierre declared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn't it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marowsko's old parrot-face beamed with satisfaction.\n\nThe doctor tasted, smacked his lips, meditated, tasted again, meditated\nagain, and spoke:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery good--capital; and quite new in flavour. It is a find, my dear\nfellow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, really? Well, I am very glad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Marowsko took counsel as to baptizing the new liqueur. He wanted\nto call it \u00e2\u0080\u009cExtract of currants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or else \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Fine Groseille_\u00e2\u0080\u009d or\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Groselia_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or again \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Groseline_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pierre did not approve of either\nof these names.\n\nThen the old man had an idea:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you said just now would be very good, very good: 'Fine Ruby.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n But the doctor disputed the merit of this name, though it had originated\nwith him. He recommended simply \u00e2\u0080\u009cGroseillette,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which Marowsko thought\nadmirable.\n\nThen they were silent, and sat for some minutes without a word under the\nsolitary gas-lamp. At last Pierre began, almost in spite of himself:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA queer thing has happened at home this evening. A friend of my\nfather's, who is lately dead, has left his fortune to my brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe druggist did not at first seem to understand, but after thinking it\nover he hoped that the doctor had half the inheritance. When the matter\nwas clearly explained to him he appeared surprised and vexed; and to\nexpress his dissatisfaction at finding that his young friend had been\nsacrificed, he said several times over:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will not look well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre, who was relapsing into nervous irritation, wanted to know what\nMarowsko meant by this phrase.\n\nWhy would it not look well? What was there to look badly in the fact\nthat his brother had come into the money of a friend of the family?\n\nBut the cautious old man would not explain further.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn such a case the money is left equally to the two brothers, and I\ntell you, it will not look well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the doctor, out of all patience, went away, returned to his father's\nhouse, and went to bed. For some time afterward he heard Jean moving\nsoftly about the adjoining room, and then, after drinking two glasses of\nwater, he fell asleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe doctor awoke next morning firmly resolved to make his fortune.\nSeveral times already he had come to the same determination without\nfollowing up the reality. At the outset of all his trials of some new\ncareer the hopes of rapidly acquired riches kept up his efforts and\nconfidence, till the first obstacle, the first check, threw him into a\nfresh path. Snug in bed between the warm sheets, he lay meditating. How\nmany medical men had become wealthy in quite a short time! All that was\nneeded was a little knowledge of the world; for in the course of his\nstudies he had learned to estimate the most famous physicians, and he\njudged them all to be asses. He was certainly as good as they, if not\nbetter. If by any means he could secure a practice among the wealth and\nfashion of Havre, he could easily make a hundred thousand francs a year.\nAnd he calculated with great exactitude what his certain profits must\nbe. He would go out in the morning to visit his patients; at the very\nmoderate average of ten a day, at twenty francs each, that would mount\nup to seventy-two thousand francs a year at least, or even seventy-five\nthousand; for ten patients was certainly below the mark. In the\nafternoon he would be at home to, say, another ten patients, at ten\nfrancs each--thirty-six thousand francs. Here, then, in round numbers\nwas an income of twenty thousand francs. Old patients, or friends whom\nhe would charge only ten francs for a visit, or see at home for\nfive, would perhaps make a slight reduction on this sum total, but\nconsultations with other physicians and various incidental fees would\nmake up for that.\n\nNothing could be easier than to achieve this by skilful advertising\nremarks in the Figaro to the effect that the scientific faculty of Paris\nhad their eye on him, and were interested in the cures effected by the\nmodest young practitioner of Havre! And he would be richer than his\nbrother, richer and more famous; and satisfied with himself, for he\nwould owe his fortune solely to his own exertions; and liberal to his\nold parents, who would be justly proud of his fame. He would not marry,\nwould not burden his life with a wife who would be in his way, but he\nwould choose his mistress from the most beautiful of his patients. He\nfelt so sure of success that he sprang out of bed as though to grasp it\non the spot, and he dressed to go and search through the town for rooms\nto suit him.\n\nThen, as he wandered about the streets, he reflected how slight are the\ncauses which determine our actions. Any time these three weeks he might\nand ought to have come to this decision, which, beyond a doubt, the news\nof his brother's inheritance had abruptly given rise to.\n\nHe stopped before every door where a placard proclaimed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cfine\napartments\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009chandsome rooms\u00e2\u0080\u009d were to be let; announcements without an\nadjective he turned from with scorn. Then he inspected them with a\nlofty air, measuring the height of the rooms, sketching the plan in his\nnote-book, with the passages, the arrangement of the exits, explaining\nthat he was a medical man and had many visitors. He must have a broad\nand well-kept stair-case; nor could he be any higher up than the first\nfloor.\n\nAfter having written down seven or eight addresses and scribbled two\nhundred notes, he got home to breakfast a quarter of an hour too late.\n\nIn the hall he heard the clatter of plates. Then they had begun without\nhim! Why? They were never wont to be so punctual. He was nettled and put\nout, for he was somewhat thin-skinned. As he went in Roland said to him:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, Pierre, make haste, devil take you! You know we have to be at the\nlawyer's at two o'clock. This is not the day to be dawdling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre sat down without replying, after kissing his mother and shaking\nhands with his father and brother; and he helped himself from the deep\ndish in the middle of the table to the cutlet which had been kept for\nhim. It was cold and dry, probably the least tempting of them all. He\nthought that they might have left it on the hot plate till he came in,\nand not lose their heads so completely as to have forgotten their other\nson, their eldest.\n\nThe conversation, which his entrance had interrupted, was taken up again\nat the point where it had ceased.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn your place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mme. Roland was saying to Jean, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you what\nI should do at once. I should settle in handsome rooms so as to attract\nattention; I should ride on horseback and select one or two interesting\ncases to defend and make a mark in court. I would be a sort of amateur\nlawyer, and very select. Thank God you are out of all danger of want,\nand if you pursue a profession, it is, after all, only that you may not\nlose the benefit of your studies, and because a man ought never to sit\nidle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Roland, who was peeling a pear, exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChristi! In your place I should buy a nice yacht, a cutter on the build\nof our pilot-boats. I would sail as far as Senegal in such a boat as\nthat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre, in his turn, spoke his views. After all, said he, it was not his\nwealth which made the moral worth, the intellectual worth of a man. To\na man of inferior mind it was only a means of degradation, while in the\nhands of a strong man it was a powerful lever. They, to be sure, were\nrare. If Jean were a really superior man, now that he could never want\nhe might prove it. But then he must work a hundred times harder than he\nwould have done in other circumstances. His business now must be not to\nargue for or against the widow and the orphan, and pocket his fees for\nevery case he gained, but to become a really eminent legal authority, a\nluminary of the law. And he added in conclusion:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I were rich wouldn't I dissect no end of bodies!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFather Roland shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is all very fine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the wisest way of life is to take\nit easy. We are not beasts of burden, but men. If you are born poor you\nmust work; well, so much the worse; and you do work. But where you have\ndividends! You must be a flat if you grind yourself to death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre replied haughtily:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur notions differ. For my part, I respect nothing on earth but\nlearning and intellect; everything else is beneath contempt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Roland always tried to deaden the constant shocks between father\nand son; she turned the conversation, and began talking of a murder\ncommitted the week before at Bolbec Nointot. Their minds were\nimmediately full of the circumstances under which the crime had been\ncommitted, and absorbed by the interesting horror, the attractive\nmystery of crime, which, however commonplace, shameful, and disgusting,\nexercises a strange and universal fascination over the curiosity of\nmankind. Now and again, however, old Roland looked at his watch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is time to be going.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre sneered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not yet one o'clock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt really was hardly worth while\nto condemn me to eat a cold cutlet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you coming to the lawyer's?\u00e2\u0080\u009d his mother asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI? No. What for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied dryly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy presence is quite unnecessary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean sat silent, as though he had no concern in the matter. When they\nwere discussing the murder at Bolbec he, as a legal authority, had\nput forward some opinions and uttered some reflections on crime and\ncriminals. Now he spoke no more; but the sparkle in his eye, the bright\ncolour in his cheeks, the very gloss of his beard seemed to proclaim his\nhappiness.\n\nWhen the family had gone, Pierre, alone once more, resumed his\ninvestigations in the apartments to let. After two or three hours\nspent in going up and down stairs, he at last found, in the Boulevard\nFrancois, a pretty set of rooms; a spacious entresol with two doors on\ntwo different streets, two drawing-rooms, a glass corridor, where his\npatients while they waited, might walk among flowers, and a delightful\ndining-room with a bow-window looking out over the sea.\n\nWhen it came to taking it, the terms--three thousand francs--pulled him\nup; the first quarter must be paid in advance, and he had nothing, not a\npenny to call his own.\n\nThe little fortune his father had saved brought him in about eight\nthousand francs a year, and Pierre had often blamed himself for having\nplaced his parents in difficulties by his long delay in deciding on a\nprofession, by forfeiting his attempts and beginning fresh courses of\nstudy. So he went away, promising to send his answer within two days,\nand it occurred to him to ask Jean to lend him the amount of this\nquarter's rent, or even of a half-year, fifteen hundred francs, as soon\nas Jean should have come into possession.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be a loan for a few months at most,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall repay\nhim, very likely before the end of the year. It is a simple matter, and\nhe will be glad to do so much for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs it was not yet four o'clock, and he had nothing to do, absolutely\nnothing, he went to sit in the public gardens; and he remained a long\ntime on a bench, without an idea in his brain, his eyes fixed on the\nground, crushed by weariness amounting to distress.\n\nAnd yet this was how he had been living all these days since his return\nhome, without suffering so acutely from the vacuity of his existence and\nfrom inaction. How had he spent his time from rising in the morning till\nbed-time?\n\nHe had loafed on the pier at high tide, loafed in the streets, loafed in\nthe cafes, loafed at Marowsko's, loafed everywhere. And on a sudden this\nlife, which he had endured till now, had become odious, intolerable. If\nhe had had any pocket-money, he would have taken a carriage for a long\ndrive in the country, along by the farm-ditches shaded by beech and elm\ntrees; but he had to think twice of the cost of a glass of beer or a\npostage-stamp, and such an indulgence was out of his ken. It suddenly\nstruck him how hard it was for a man of past thirty to be reduced to ask\nhis mother, with a blush for a twenty-franc piece every now and then;\nand he muttered, as he scored the gravel with the ferule of his stick:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cChristi, if I only had money!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd again the thought of his brother's legacy came into his head like\nthe sting of a wasp; but he drove it out indignantly, not choosing to\nallow himself to slip down that descent to jealousy.\n\nSome children were playing about in the dusty paths. They were fair\nlittle things with long hair, and they were making little mounds of sand\nwith the greatest gravity and careful attention, to crush them at once\nby stamping on them.\n\nIt was one of those gloomy days with Pierre when we pry into every\ncorner of our souls and shake out every crease.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll our endeavours are like the labours of those babies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought he.\nAnd then he wondered whether the wisest thing in life were not to beget\ntwo or three of these little creatures and watch them grow up with\ncomplacent curiosity. A longing for marriage breathed on his soul. A\nman is not so lost when he is not alone. At any rate, he has some one\nstirring at his side in hours of trouble or of uncertainty; and it is\nsomething only to be able to speak on equal terms to a woman when one is\nsuffering.\n\nThen he began thinking of women. He knew very little of them, never\nhaving had any but very transient connections as a medical student,\nbroken off as soon as the month's allowance was spent, and renewed or\nreplaced by another the following month. And yet there must be some very\nkind, gentle, and comforting creatures among them. Had not his mother\nbeen the good sense and saving grace of his own home? How glad he would\nbe to know a woman, a true woman!\n\nHe started up with a sudden determination to go and call on Mme.\nRosemilly. But he promptly sat down again. He did not like that woman.\nWhy not? She had too much vulgar and sordid common sense; besides,\ndid she not seem to prefer Jean? Without confessing it to himself too\nbluntly, this preference had a great deal to do with his low opinion of\nthe widow's intellect; for, though he loved his brother, he could not\nhelp thinking him somewhat mediocre and believing himself the superior.\nHowever, he was not going to sit there till nightfall; and as he had\ndone on the previous evening, he anxiously asked himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat am I\ngoing to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this moment he felt in his soul the need of a melting mood, of being\nembraced and comforted. Comforted--for what? He could not have put it\ninto words; but he was in one of these hours of weakness and exhaustion\nwhen a woman's presence, a woman's kiss, the touch of a hand, the rustle\nof a petticoat, a soft look out of black or blue eyes, seem the one\nthing needful, there and then, to our heart. And the memory flashed upon\nhim of a little barmaid at a beer-house, whom he had walked home with\none evening, and seen again from time to time.\n\nSo once more he rose, to go and drink a bock with the girl. What should\nhe say to her? What would she say to him? Nothing, probably. But what\ndid that matter? He would hold her hand for a few seconds. She seemed to\nhave a fancy for him. Why, then, did he not go to see her oftener?\n\nHe found her dozing on a chair in the beer-shop, which was almost\ndeserted. Three men were drinking and smoking with their elbows on the\noak tables; the book-keeper in her desk was reading a novel, while the\nmaster, in his shirt-sleeves, lay sound asleep on a bench.\n\nAs soon as she saw him the girl rose eagerly, and coming to meet him,\nsaid:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-day, monsieur--how are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPretty well; and you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--oh, very well. How scarce you make yourself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. I have very little time to myself. I am a doctor, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed! You never told me. If I had known that--I was out of sorts last\nweek and I would have sent for you. What will you take?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA bock. And you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will have a bock, too, since you are willing to treat me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had addressed him with the familiar _tu_, and continued to use\nit, as if the offer of a drink had tacitly conveyed permission. Then,\nsitting down opposite each other, they talked for a while. Every now and\nthen she took his hand with the light familiarity of girls whose kisses\nare for sale, and looking at him with inviting eyes she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don't you come here oftener? I like you very much, sweetheart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was already disgusted with her; he saw how stupid she was, and\ncommon, smacking of low life. A woman, he told himself, should appear to\nus in dreams, or such a glory as may poetize her vulgarity.\n\nNext she asked him:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou went by the other morning with a handsome fair man, wearing a big\nbeard. Is he your brother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, he is my brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAwfully good-looking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, indeed; and he looks like a man who enjoys life, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat strange craving impelled him on a sudden to tell this tavern-wench\nabout Jean's legacy? Why should this thing, which he kept at arm's\nlength when he was alone, which he drove from him for fear of the\ntorment it brought upon his soul, rise to his lips at this moment? And\nwhy did he allow it to overflow them as if he needed once more to empty\nout his heart to some one, gorged as it was with bitterness?\n\nHe crossed his legs and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has wonderful luck, that brother of mine. He had just come into a\nlegacy of twenty thousand francs a year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe opened those covetous blue eyes of hers very wide.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! and who left him that? His grandmother or his aunt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. An old friend of my parents'.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly a friend! Impossible! And you--did he leave you nothing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. I knew him very slightly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe sat thinking some minutes; then, with an odd smile on her lips, she\nsaid:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, he is a lucky dog, that brother of yours, to have friends of this\npattern. My word! and no wonder he is so unlike you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe longed to slap her, without knowing why; and he asked with pinched\nlips: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what do you mean by saying that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had put on a stolid, innocent face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO--h, nothing. I mean he has better luck than you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe tossed a franc piece on the table and went out.\n\nNow he kept repeating the phrase: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo wonder he is so unlike you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat had her thought been, what had been her meaning under those words?\nThere was certainly some malice, some spite, something shameful in it.\nYes, that hussy must have fancied, no doubt, that Jean was Marechal's\nson. The agitation which came over him at the notion of this suspicion\ncast at his mother was so violent that he stood still, looking about\nhim for some place where he might sit down. In front of him was another\ncafe. He went in, took a chair, and as the waiter came up, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA bock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid.\n\nHe felt his heart beating, his skin was gooseflesh. And then the\nrecollection flashed upon him of what Marowsko had said the evening\nbefore. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will not look well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Had he had the same thought, the same\nsuspicion as this baggage? Hanging his head over the glass, he watched\nthe white froth as the bubbles rose and burst, asking himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it\npossible that such a thing should be believed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the reasons which might give rise to this horrible doubt in other\nmen's minds now struck him, one after another, as plain, obvious, and\nexasperating. That a childless old bachelor should leave his fortune to\na friend's two sons was the most simple and natural thing in the world;\nbut that he should leave the whole of it to one alone--of course people\nwould wonder, and whisper, and end by smiling. How was it that he had\nnot foreseen this, that his father had not felt it? How was it that\nhis mother had not guessed it? No; they had been too delighted at this\nunhoped-for wealth for the idea to come near them. And besides, how\nshould these worthy souls have ever dreamed of anything so ignominious?\n\nBut the public--their neighbours, the shopkeepers, their own tradesmen,\nall who knew them--would not they repeat the abominable thing, laugh at\nit, enjoy it, make game of his father and despise his mother?\n\nAnd the barmaid's remark that Jean was fair and he dark, that they were\nnot in the least alike in face, manner, figure, or intelligence, would\nnow strike every eye and every mind. When any one spoke of Roland's son,\nthe question would be: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich, the real or the false?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe rose, firmly resolved to warn Jean, and put him on his guard against\nthe frightful danger which threatened their mother's honour.\n\nBut what could Jean do? The simplest thing no doubt, would be to refuse\nthe inheritance, which would then go to the poor, and to tell all\nfriends or acquaintances who had heard of the bequest that the will\ncontained clauses and conditions impossible to subscribe to, which would\nhave made Jean not inheritor but merely a trustee.\n\nAs he made his way home he was thinking that he must see his brother\nalone, so as not to speak of such a matter in the presence of his\nparents. On reaching the door he heard a great noise of voices and\nlaughter in the drawing-room, and when he went in he found Captain\nBeausire and Mme. Rosemilly, whom his father had brought home and\nengaged to dine with them in honour of the good news. Vermouth and\nabsinthe had been served to whet their appetites, and every one had been\nat once put into good spirits. Captain Beausire, a funny little man who\nhad become quite round by dint of being rolled about at sea, and whose\nideas also seemed to have been worn round, like the pebbles of a beach,\nwhile he laughed with his throat full of _r_'s, looked upon life as a\ncapital thing, in which everything that might turn up was good to take.\nHe clinked his glass against father Roland's, while Jean was offering\ntwo freshly filled glasses to the ladies. Mme. Rosemilly refused, till\nCaptain Beausire, who had known her husband, cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, madame, _bis repetita placent_, as we say in the lingo,\nwhich is as much as to say two glasses of vermouth never hurt any one.\nLook at me; since I have left the sea, in this way I give myself an\nartificial roll or two every day before dinner; I add a little pitching\nafter my coffee, and that keeps things lively for the rest of the\nevening. I never rise to a hurricane, mind you, never, never. I am too\nmuch afraid of damage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland, whose nautical mania was humoured by the old mariner, laughed\nheartily, his face flushed already and his eye watery from the absinthe.\nHe had a burly shop-keeping stomach--nothing but stomach--in which the\nrest of his body seemed to have got stowed away; the flabby paunch of\nmen who spend their lives sitting, and who have neither thighs, nor\nchest, nor arms, nor neck; the seat of their chairs having accumulated\nall their substance in one spot. Beausire, on the contrary, though short\nand stout, was as tight as an egg and as hard as a cannon-ball.\n\nMme. Roland had not emptied her glass and was gazing at her son Jean\nwith sparkling eyes; happiness had brought a colour to her cheeks.\n\nIn him, too, the fulness of joy had now blazed out. It was a settled\nthing, signed and sealed; he had twenty thousand francs a year. In the\nsound of his laugh, in the fuller voice with which he spoke, in his\nway of looking at the others, his more positive manners, his greater\nconfidence, the assurance given by money was at once perceptible.\n\nDinner was announced, and as the old man was about to offer his arm to\nMme. Rosemilly, his wife exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, father. Everything is for Jean to-day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUnwonted luxury graced the table. In front of Jean, who sat in his\nfather's place, an enormous bouquet of flowers--a bouquet for a really\ngreat occasion--stood up like a cupola dressed with flags, and was\nflanked by four high dishes, one containing a pyramid of splendid\npeaches; the second, a monumental cake gorged with whipped cream and\ncovered with pinnacles of sugar--a cathedral in confectionery;\nthe third, slices of pine-apple floating in clear sirup; and the\nfourth--unheard-of lavishness--black grapes brought from the warmer\nsouth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe devil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Pierre as he sat down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are celebrating the\naccession of Jean the rich.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter the soup, Madeira was passed round, and already every one was\ntalking at once. Beausire was giving the history of a dinner he had\neaten at San Domingo at the table of a negro general. Old Roland was\nlistening, and at the same time trying to get in, between the sentences,\nhis account of another dinner, given by a friend of his at Mendon, after\nwhich every guest was ill for a fortnight. Mme. Rosemilly, Jean, and\nhis mother were planning an excursion to breakfast at Saint Jouin, from\nwhich they promised themselves the greatest pleasure; and Pierre was\nonly sorry that he had not dined alone in some pot-house by the sea, so\nas to escape all this noise and laughter and glee which fretted him. He\nwas wondering how he could now set to work to confide his fears to his\nbrother, and induce him to renounce the fortune he had already accepted\nand of which he was enjoying the intoxicating foretaste. It would be\nhard on him, no doubt; but it must be done; he could not hesitate; their\nmother's reputation was at stake.\n\nThe appearance of an enormous shade-fish threw Roland back on fishing\nstories. Beausire told some wonderful tales of adventure on the Gaboon,\nat Sainte-Marie, in Madagascar, and above all, off the coasts of China\nand Japan, where the fish are as queer-looking as the natives. And he\ndescribed the appearance of these fishes--their goggle gold eyes, their\nblue or red bellies, their fantastic fins like fans, their eccentric\ncrescent-shaped tails--with such droll gesticulation that they all\nlaughed till they cried as they listened.\n\nPierre alone seemed incredulous, muttering to himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue enough, the\nNormans are the Gascons of the north!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter the fish came a vol-au-vent, then a roast fowl, a salad, French\nbeans with a Pithiviers lark-pie. Mme. Rosemilly's maid helped to wait\non them, and the fun rose with the number of glasses of wine they drank.\nWhen the cork of the first champagne-bottle was drawn with a pop, father\nRoland, highly excited, imitated the noise with his tongue and then\ndeclared: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like that noise better than a pistol-shot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre, more and more fractious every moment, retorted with a sneer:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet it is perhaps a greater danger for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland, who was on the point of drinking, set his full glass down on the\ntable again, and asked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had for some time been complaining of his health, of heaviness,\ngiddiness, frequent and unaccountable discomfort. The doctor replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause the bullet might very possibly miss you, while the glass of\nwine is dead certain to hit you in the stomach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it scorches your inside, upsets your nervous system, makes the\ncirculation sluggish, and leads the way to the apoplectic fit which\nalways threatens a man of your build.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe jeweller's incipient intoxication had vanished like smoke before the\nwind. He looked at his son with fixed, uneasy eyes, trying to discover\nwhether he was making game of him.\n\nBut Beausire exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, these confounded doctors! They all sing the same tune--eat nothing,\ndrink nothing, never make love or enjoy yourself; it all plays the devil\nwith your precious health. Well, all I can say is, I have done all these\nthings, sir, in every quarter of the globe, wherever and as often as I\nhave had the chance, and I am none the worse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre answered with some asperity:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the first place, captain, you are a stronger man than my father; and\nin the next, all free livers talk as you do till the day when--when they\ncome back no more to say to the cautious doctor: 'You were right.' When\nI see my father doing what is worst and most dangerous for him, it\nis but natural that I should warn him. I should be a bad son if I did\notherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Roland, much distressed, now put in her word: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, Pierre, what\nails you? For once it cannot hurt him. Think of what an occasion it\nis for him, for all of us. You will spoil his pleasure and make us all\nunhappy. It is too bad of you to do such a thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe muttered, as he shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe can do as he pleases. I have warned him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut father Roland did not drink. He sat looking at his glass full of the\nclear and luminous liquor while its light soul, its intoxicating soul,\nflew off in tiny bubbles mounting from its depths in hurried succession\nto die on the surface. He looked at it with the suspicious eye of a fox\nsmelling at a dead hen and suspecting a trap. He asked doubtfully: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo\nyou think it will really do me much harm?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pierre had a pang of remorse\nand blamed himself for letting his ill-humour punish the rest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust for once you may drink it; but do not take too\nmuch, or get into the habit of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen old Roland raised his glass, but still he could not make up his\nmind to put it to his lips. He contemplated it regretfully, with longing\nand with fear; then he smelt it, tasted it, drank it in sips, swallowing\nthem slowly, his heart full of terrors, of weakness and greediness; and\nthen, when he had drained the last drop, of regret.\n\nPierre's eye suddenly met that of Mme. Rosemilly; it rested on him clear\nand blue, far-seeing and hard. And he read, he knew, the precise thought\nwhich lurked in that look, the indignant thought of this simple and\nright-minded little woman; for the look said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are jealous--that is\nwhat you are. Shameful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe bent his head and went on with his dinner.\n\nHe was not hungry and found nothing nice. A longing to be off harassed\nhim, a craving to be away from these people, to hear no more of their\ntalking, jests, and laughter.\n\nFather Roland meanwhile, to whose head the fumes of the wine were rising\nonce more, had already forgotten his son's advice and was eyeing a\nchampagne-bottle with a tender leer as it stood, still nearly full, by\nthe side of his plate. He dared not touch it for fear of being lectured\nagain, and he was wondering by what device or trick he could possess\nhimself of it without exciting Pierre's remark. A ruse occurred to\nhim, the simplest possible. He took up the bottle with an air of\nindifference, and holding it by the neck, stretched his arm across the\ntable to fill the doctor's glass, which was empty; then he filled up\nall the other glasses, and when he came to his own he began talking very\nloud, so that if he poured anything into it they might have sworn it was\ndone inadvertently. And in fact no one took any notice.\n\nPierre, without observing it, was drinking a good deal. Nervous and\nfretted, he every minute raised to his lips the tall crystal funnel\nwhere the bubbles were dancing in the living, translucent fluid. He let\nthe wine slip very slowly over his tongue, that he might feel the little\nsugary sting of the fixed air as it evaporated.\n\nGradually a pleasant warmth glowed in his frame. Starting from the\nstomach as a centre, it spread to his chest, took possession of his\nlimbs, and diffused itself throughout his flesh, like a warm and\ncomforting tide, bringing pleasure with it. He felt better now, less\nimpatient, less annoyed, and his determination to speak to his brother\nthat very evening faded away; not that he thought for a moment of\ngiving it up, but simply not to disturb the happy mood in which he found\nhimself.\n\nBeausire presently rose to propose a toast. Having bowed to the company,\nhe began:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost gracious ladies and gentlemen, we have met to do honour to a happy\nevent which has befallen one of our friends. It used to be said that\nFortune was blind, but I believe that she is only short-sighted or\ntricksy, and that she has lately bought a good pair of glasses which\nenabled her to discover in the town of Havre the son of our worthy\nfriend Roland, skipper of the Pearl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEvery one cried bravo and clapped their hands, and the elder Roland rose\nto reply. After clearing his throat, for it felt thick and his tongue\nwas heavy, he stammered out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, captain, thank you--for myself and my son. I shall never\nforget your behaviour on this occasion. Here's good luck to you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis eyes and nose were full of tears, and he sat down, finding nothing\nmore to say.\n\nJean, who was laughing, spoke in his turn:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho ought to thank my friends here, my excellent\nfriends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he glanced at Mme. Rosemilly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho have given me such a\ntouching evidence of their affection. But it is not by words that I can\nprove my gratitude. I will prove it to-morrow, every hour of my life,\nalways, for our friendship is not one of those which fade away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis mother, deeply moved, murmured: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell said, my boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Beausire cried out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, Mme. Rosemilly, speak on behalf of the fair sex.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe raised her glass, and in a pretty voice, slightly touched with\nsadness, she said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will pledge you to the memory of M. Marechal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a few moments' lull, a pause for decent meditation, as after\nprayer. Beausire, who always had a flow of compliment, remarked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly a woman ever thinks of these refinements.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then turning to Father\nRoland: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who was this Marechal, after all? You must have been very\nintimate with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man, emotional with drink, began to whimper, and in a broken\nvoice he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike a brother, you know. Such a friend as one does not make twice--we\nwere always together--he dined with us every evening--and would treat us\nto the play--I need say no more--no more--no more. A true friend--a real\ntrue friend--wasn't he, Louise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis wife merely answered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; he was a faithful friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre looked at his father and then at his mother, then, as the subject\nchanged he drank some more wine. He scarcely remembered the remainder of\nthe evening. They had coffee, then liqueurs, and they laughed and joked\na great deal. At about midnight he went to bed, his mind confused and\nhis head heavy; and he slept like a brute till nine next morning.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThese slumbers, lapped in Champagne and Chartreuse, had soothed and\ncalmed him, no doubt, for he awoke in a very benevolent frame of\nmind. While he was dressing he appraised, weighed, and summed up the\nagitations of the past day, trying to bring out quite clearly and fully\ntheir real and occult causes, those personal to himself as well as those\nfrom outside.\n\nIt was, in fact, possible that the girl at the beer-shop had had an evil\nsuspicion--a suspicion worthy of such a hussy--on hearing that only one\nof the Roland brothers had been made heir to a stranger; but have\nnot such natures as she always similar notions, without a shadow of\nfoundation, about every honest woman? Do they not, whenever they speak,\nvilify, calumniate, and abuse all whom they believe to be blameless?\nWhenever a woman who is above imputation is mentioned in their presence,\nthey are as angry as if they were being insulted, and exclaim: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, yes,\nI know your married women; a pretty sort they are! Why, they have\nmore lovers than we have, only they conceal it because they are such\nhypocrites. Oh, yes, a pretty sort, indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUnder any other circumstances he would certainly not have understood,\nnot have imagined the possibility of such an insinuation against his\npoor mother, who was so kind, so simple, so excellent. But his spirit\nseethed with the leaven of jealousy that was fermenting within him. His\nown excited mind, on the scent, as it were, in spite of himself, for all\nthat could damage his brother, had even perhaps attributed to the tavern\nbarmaid an odious intention of which she was innocent. It was possible\nthat his imagination had, unaided, invented this dreadful doubt--his\nimagination, which he never controlled, which constantly evaded his will\nand went off, unfettered, audacious, adventurous, and stealthy, into\nthe infinite world of ideas, bringing back now and then some which were\nshameless and repulsive, and which it buried in him, in the depths of\nhis soul, in its most fathomless recesses, like something stolen. His\nheart, most certainly, his own heart had secrets from him; and had\nnot that wounded heart discerned in this atrocious doubt a means of\ndepriving his brother of the inheritance of which he was jealous? He\nsuspected himself now, cross-examining all the mysteries of his mind as\nbigots search their consciences.\n\nMme. Rosemilly, though her intelligence was limited, had certainly a\nwoman's instinct, scent, and subtle intuitions. And this notion had\nnever entered her head, since she had, with perfect simplicity, drunk\nto the blessed memory of the deceased Marechal. She was not the woman to\nhave done this if she had had the faintest suspicion. Now he doubted no\nlonger; his involuntary displeasure at his brother's windfall of\nfortune and his religious affection for his mother had magnified his\nscruples--very pious and respectable scruples, but exaggerated. As he\nput this conclusion into words in his own mind he felt happy, as at\nthe doing of a good action; and he resolved to be nice to every one,\nbeginning with his father, whose manias, and silly statements, and\nvulgar opinions, and too conspicuous mediocrity were a constant\nirritation to him.\n\nHe came in not late for breakfast, and amused all the family by his fun\nand good humour.\n\nHis mother, quite delighted, said to him:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy little Pierre, you have no notion how humorous and clever you can be\nwhen you choose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he talked, putting things in a witty way, and making them laugh\nby ingenious hits at their friends. Beausire was his butt, and Mme.\nRosemilly a little, but in a very judicious way, not too spiteful. And\nhe thought as he looked at his brother: \u00e2\u0080\u009cStand up for her, you muff. You\nmay be as rich as you please, I can always eclipse you when I take the\ntrouble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs they drank their coffee he said to his father:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you going out in the Pearl to-day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I have her with Jean Bart?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure, as long as you like.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe bought a good cigar at the first tobacconist's and went down to the\nquay with a light step. He glanced up at the sky, which was clear and\nluminous, of a pale blue, freshly swept by the sea-breeze.\n\nPapagris, the boatman, commonly called Jean Bart, was dozing in the\nbottom of the boat, which he was required to have in readiness every day\nat noon when they had not been out fishing in the morning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou and I together, mate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Pierre. He went down the iron ladder\nof the quay and leaped into the vessel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich way is the wind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDue east still, M'sieu Pierre. A fine breeze out at sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, old man, off we go!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey hoisted the foresail and weighed anchor; and the boat, feeling\nherself free, glided slowly down towards the jetty on the still water\nof the harbour. The breath of wind that came down the streets caught the\ntop of the sail so lightly as to be imperceptible, and the Pearl seemed\nendowed with life--the life of a vessel driven on by a mysterious latent\npower. Pierre took the tiller, and, holding his cigar between his teeth,\nhe stretched his legs on the bunk, and with his eyes half-shut in the\nblinding sunshine, he watched the great tarred timbers of the breakwater\nas they glided past.\n\nWhen they reached the open sea, round the nose of the north pier which\nhad sheltered them, the fresher breeze puffed in the doctor's face and\non his hands, like a somewhat icy caress, filled his chest, which rose\nwith a long sigh to drink it in, and swelling the tawny sail, tilted the\nPearl on her beam and made her more lively. Jean Bart hastily hauled up\nthe jib, and the triangle of canvas, full of wind, looked like a wing;\nthen, with two strides to the stern, he let out the spinnaker, which was\nclose-reefed against his mast.\n\nThen, along the hull of the boat, which suddenly heeled over and was\nrunning at top speed, there was a soft, crisp sound of water hissing and\nrushing past. The prow ripped up the sea like the share of a plough gone\nmad, and the yielding water it turned up curled over and fell white with\nfoam, as the ploughed soil, heavy and brown, rolls and falls in a ridge.\nAt each wave they met--and there was a short, chopping sea--the Pearl\nshivered from the point of the bowsprit to the rudder, which trembled\nunder Pierre's hand; when the wind blew harder in gusts, the swell rose\nto the gunwale as if it would overflow into the boat. A coal brig from\nLiverpool was lying at anchor, waiting for the tide; they made a sweep\nround her stern and went to look at each of the vessels in the roads one\nafter another; then they put further out to look at the unfolding line\nof coast.\n\nFor three hours Pierre, easy, calm, and happy, wandered to and fro over\nthe dancing waters, guiding the thing of wood and canvas, which came and\nwent at his will, under the pressure of his hand, as if it were a swift\nand docile winged creature.\n\nHe was lost in day-dreams, the dreams one has on horseback or on the\ndeck of a boat; thinking of his future, which should be brilliant, and\nthe joys of living intelligently. On the morrow he would ask his brother\nto lend him fifteen hundred francs for three months, that he might\nsettle at once in the pretty rooms on the Boulevard Francois.\n\nSuddenly the sailor said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fog is coming up, M'sieu Pierre. We must\ngo in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked up and saw to the northward a gray shade, filmy but dense,\nblotting out the sky and covering the sea; it was sweeping down on them\nlike a cloud fallen from above. He tacked for land and made for the\npier, scudding before the wind and followed by the flying fog, which\ngained upon them. When it reached the Pearl, wrapping her in its\nintangible density, a cold shudder ran over Pierre's limbs, and a smell\nof smoke and mould, the peculiar smell of a sea-fog, made him close his\nmouth that he might not taste the cold, wet vapour. By the time the boat\nwas at her usual moorings in the harbour the whole town was buried in\nthis fine mist, which did not fall but yet wetted everything like rain,\nand glided and rolled along the roofs and streets like the flow of a\nriver. Pierre, with his hands and feet frozen, made haste home and threw\nhimself on his bed to take a nap till dinner-time. When he made his\nappearance in the dining-room his mother was saying to Jean:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe glass corridor will be lovely. We will fill it with flowers. You\nwill see. I will undertake to care for them and renew them. When you\ngive a party the effect will be quite fairy-like.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat in the world are you talking about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf a delightful apartment I have just taken for your brother. It is\nquite a find; an entresol looking out on two streets. There are two\ndrawing-rooms, a glass passage, and a little circular dining-room,\nperfectly charming for a bachelor's quarters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre turned pale. His anger seemed to press on his heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBoulevard Francois.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was no possibility for doubt. He took his seat in such a state\nof exasperation that he longed to exclaim: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is really too much! Is\nthere nothing for any one but him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis mother, beaming, went on talking: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd only fancy, I got it for two\nthousand eight hundred francs a year. They asked three thousand, but I\ngot a reduction of two hundred francs on taking for three, six, or nine\nyears. Your brother will be delightfully housed there. An elegant home\nis enough to make the fortune of a lawyer. It attracts clients, charms\nthem, holds them fast, commands respect, and shows them that a man who\nlives in such good style expects a good price for his words.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was silent for a few seconds and then went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must look out for something suitable for you; much less pretentious,\nsince you have nothing, but nice and pretty all the same. I assure you\nit will be to your advantage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre replied contemptuously:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me! Oh, I shall make my way by hard work and learning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut his mother insisted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, but I assure you that to be well lodged\nwill be of use to you nevertheless.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbout half-way through the meal he suddenly asked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did you first come to know this man Marechal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Roland looked up and racked his memory:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait a bit; I scarcely recollect. It is such an old story now. Ah, yes,\nI remember. It was your mother who made the acquaintance with him in the\nshop, was it not, Louise? He first came to order something, and then\nhe called frequently. We knew him as a customer before we knew him as a\nfriend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre, who was eating beans, sticking his fork into them one by one as\nif he were spitting them, went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when was it that you made his acquaintance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgain Roland sat thinking, but he could remember no more and appealed to\nhis wife's better memory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn what year was it, Louise? You surely have not forgotten, you\nwho remember everything. Let me see--it was in--in--in fifty-five or\nfifty-six? Try to remember. You ought to know better than I.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did in fact think it over for some minutes, and then replied in a\nsteady voice and with calm decision:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was in fifty-eight, old man. Pierre was three years old. I am quite\nsure that I am not mistaken, for it was in that year that the child had\nscarlet fever, and Marechal, whom we knew then but very little, was of\nthe greatest service to us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure--very true; he was really invaluable. When your mother was\nhalf-dead with fatigue and I had to attend to the shop, he would go to\nthe chemist's to fetch your medicine. He really had the kindest heart!\nAnd when you were well again, you cannot think how glad he was and how\nhe petted you. It was from that time that we became such great friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd this thought rushed into Pierre's soul, as abrupt and violent as a\ncannon-ball rending and piercing it: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince he knew me first, since he\nwas so devoted to me, since he was so fond of me and petted me so much,\nsince I--_I_ was the cause of his great intimacy with my parents, why\ndid he leave all his money to my brother and nothing to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe asked no more questions and remained gloomy; absent-minded rather\nthan thoughtful, feeling in his soul a new anxiety as yet undefined, the\nsecret germ of a new pain.\n\nHe went out early, wandering about the streets once more. They were\nshrouded in the fog which made the night heavy, opaque, and nauseous.\nIt was like a pestilential cloud dropped on the earth. It could be seen\nswirling past the gas-lights, which it seemed to put out at intervals.\nThe pavement was as slippery as on a frosty night after rain, and\nall sorts of evil smells seemed to come up from the bowels of the\nhouses--the stench of cellars, drains, sewers, squalid kitchens--to\nmingle with the horrible savour of this wandering fog.\n\nPierre, with his shoulders up and his hands in his pockets, not caring\nto remain out of doors in the cold, turned into Marowsko's. The\ndruggist was asleep as usual under the gas-light, which kept watch. On\nrecognising Pierre for whom he had the affection of a faithful dog,\nhe shook off his drowsiness, went for two glasses, and brought out the\n_Groseillette_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow is the liqueur getting on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Pole explained that four of the chief cafes in the town had agreed\nto have it on sale, and that two papers, the _Northcoast Pharos_ and the\n_Havre Semaphore_, would advertise it, in return for certain chemical\npreparations to be supplied to the editors.\n\nAfter a long silence Marowsko asked whether Jean had come definitely\ninto possession of his fortune; and then he put two or three other\nquestions vaguely referring to the same subject. His jealous devotion\nto Pierre rebelled against this preference. And Pierre felt as though he\ncould hear him thinking; he guessed and understood, read in his averted\neyes and in the hesitancy of his tone, the words which rose to his lips\nbut were not spoken--which the druggist was too timid or too prudent and\ncautious to utter.\n\nAt this moment, he felt sure, the old man was thinking: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ought not\nto have suffered him to accept this inheritance which will make people\nspeak ill of your mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPerhaps, indeed, Marowsko believed that Jean was Marechal's son. Of\ncourse he believed it! How could he help believing it when the thing\nmust seem so possible, so probable, self-evident? Why, he himself,\nPierre, her son--had not he been for these three days past fighting with\nall the subtlety at his command to cheat his reason, fighting against\nthis hideous suspicion?\n\nAnd suddenly the need to be alone, to reflect, to discuss the matter\nwith himself--to face boldly, without scruple or weakness, this possible\nbut monstrous thing--came upon him anew, and so imperative that he rose\nwithout even drinking his glass of _Groseillette_, shook hands with the\nastounded druggist, and plunged out into the foggy streets again.\n\nHe asked himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat made this Marechal leave all his fortune to\nJean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was not jealousy now which made him dwell on this question, not the\nrather mean but natural envy which he knew lurked within him, and with\nwhich he had been struggling these three days, but the dread of an\noverpowering horror; the dread that he himself should believe that Jean,\nhis brother, was that man's son.\n\nNo. He did not believe it, he could not even ask himself the question\nwhich was a crime! Meanwhile he must get rid of this faint suspicion,\nimprobable as it was, utterly and forever. He craved for light, for\ncertainty--he must win absolute security in his heart, for he loved no\none in the world but his mother. And as he wandered alone through the\ndarkness he would rack his memory and his reason with a minute search\nthat should bring out the blazing truth. Then there would be an end\nto the matter; he would not think of it again--never. He would go and\nsleep.\n\nHe argued thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me see: first to examine the facts; then I will\nrecall all I know about him, his behaviour to my brother and to me. I\nwill seek out the causes which might have given rise to the preference.\nHe knew Jean from his birth? Yes, but he had known me first. If he had\nloved my mother silently, unselfishly, he would surely have chosen me,\nsince it was through me, through my scarlet fever, that he became so\nintimate with my parents. Logically, then, he ought to have preferred\nme, to have had a keener affection for me--unless it were that he felt\nan instinctive attraction and predilection for my brother as he watched\nhim grow up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, with desperate tension of brain and of all the powers of his\nintellect, he strove to reconstitute from memory the image of this\nMarechal, to see him, to know him, to penetrate the man whom he had seen\npass by him, indifferent to his heart during all those years in Paris.\n\nBut he perceived that the slight exertion of walking somewhat disturbed\nhis ideas, dislocated their continuity, weakened their precision,\nclouded his recollection. To enable him to look at the past and at\nunknown events with so keen an eye that nothing should escape it, he\nmust be motionless in a vast and empty space. And he made up his mind\nto go and sit on the jetty as he had done that other night. As he\napproached the harbour he heard, out at sea, a lugubrious and sinister\nwail like the bellowing of a bull, but more long-drawn and steady. It\nwas the roar of a fog-horn, the cry of a ship lost in the fog. A shiver\nran through him, chilling his heart; so deeply did this cry of distress\nthrill his soul and nerves that he felt as if he had uttered it himself.\nAnother and a similar voice answered with such another moan, but farther\naway; then, close by, the fog-horn on the pier gave out a fearful sound\nin answer. Pierre made for the jetty with long steps, thinking no\nmore of anything, content to walk on into this ominous and bellowing\ndarkness.\n\nWhen he had seated himself at the end of the breakwater he closed his\neyes, that he might not see the two electric lights, now blurred by the\nfog, which make the harbour accessible at night, and the red glare\nof the light on the south pier, which was, however, scarcely visible.\nTurning half-round, he rested his elbows on the granite and hid his face\nin his hands.\n\nThough he did not pronounce the words with his lips, his mind kept\nrepeating: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarechal--Marechal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as if to raise and challenge the shade.\nAnd on the black background of his closed eyelids, he suddenly saw him\nas he had known him: a man of about sixty, with a white beard cut in\na point and very thick eyebrows, also white. He was neither tall nor\nshort, his manner was pleasant, his eyes gray and soft, his movements\ngentle, his whole appearance that of a good fellow, simple and kindly.\nHe called Pierre and Jean \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy dear children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and had never seemed to\nprefer either, asking them both together to dine with him. And then\nPierre, with the pertinacity of a dog seeking a lost scent, tried to\nrecall the words, gestures, tones, looks, of this man who had vanished\nfrom the world. By degrees he saw him quite clearly in his rooms in the\nRue Tronchet, where he received his brother and himself at dinner.\n\nHe was waited on by two maids, both old women who had been in the\nhabit--a very old one, no doubt--of saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur Jean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marechal would hold out both hands, the right hand to\none of the young men, the left to the other, as they happened to come\nin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow are you, my children?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you any news of your\nparents? As for me, they never write to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe talk was quiet and intimate, of commonplace matters. There was\nnothing remarkable in the man's mind, but much that was winning,\ncharming, and gracious. He had certainly been a good friend to them, one\nof those good friends of whom we think the less because we feel sure of\nthem.\n\nNow, reminiscences came readily to Pierre's mind. Having seen him\nanxious from time to time, and suspecting his student's impecuniousness,\nMarechal had of his own accord offered and lent him money, a few hundred\nfrancs perhaps, forgotten by both, and never repaid. Then this man must\nalways have been fond of him, always have taken an interest in him,\nsince he thought of his needs. Well then--well then--why leave his whole\nfortune to Jean? No, he had never shown more marked affection for the\nyounger than for the elder, had never been more interested in one than\nin the other, or seemed to care more tenderly for this one or that one.\nWell then--well then--he must have had some strong secret reason for\nleaving everything to Jean--everything--and nothing to Pierre.\n\nThe more he thought, the more he recalled the past few years, the more\nextraordinary, the more incredible was it that he should have made such\na difference between them. And an agonizing pang of unspeakable anguish\npiercing his bosom made his heart beat like a fluttering rag. Its\nsprings seemed broken, and the blood rushed through in a flood,\nunchecked, tossing it with wild surges.\n\nThen in an undertone, as a man speaks in a nightmare, he muttered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nmust know. My God! I must know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked further back now, to an earlier time, when his parents\nhad lived in Paris. But the faces escaped him, and this confused his\nrecollections. He struggled above all to see Marechal, with light, or\nbrown, or black hair. But he could not; the later image, his face as an\nold man, blotted out all others. However, he remembered that he had been\nslighter, and had a soft hand, and that he often brought flowers. Very\noften--for his father would constantly say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, another bouquet! But\nthis is madness, my dear fellow; you will ruin yourself in roses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And\nMarechal would say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo matter; I like it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd suddenly his mother's voice and accent, his mother's as she smiled\nand said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, my kind friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d flashed on his brain, so clearly\nthat he could have believed he heard her. She must have spoken those\nwords very often that they should remain thus graven on her son's\nmemory.\n\nSo Marechal brought flowers; he, the gentleman, the rich man, the\ncustomer, to the humble shop-keeper, the jeweller's wife. Had he loved\nher? Why should he have made friends with these tradespeople if he had\nnot been in love with the wife? He was a man of education and fairly\nrefined tastes. How many a time had he discussed poets and poetry with\nPierre. He did not appreciate these writers from an artistic point of\nview, but with sympathetic and responsive feeling. The doctor had often\nsmiled at his emotions which had struck him as rather silly, now he\nplainly saw that this sentimental soul could never, never have been the\nfriend of his father, who was so matter-of-fact, so narrow, so heavy, to\nwhom the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoetry\u00e2\u0080\u009d meant idiocy.\n\nThis Marechal then, being young, free, rich, ready for any form of\ntenderness, went by chance into the shop one day, having perhaps\nobserved its pretty mistress. He had bought something, had come again,\nhad chatted, more intimately each time, paying by frequent purchases\nfor the right of a seat in the family, of smiling at the young wife and\nshaking hands with the husband.\n\nAnd what next--what next--good God--what next?\n\nHe had loved and petted the first child, the jeweller's child, till the\nsecond was born; then, till death, he had remained impenetrable; and\nwhen his grave was closed, his flesh dust, his name erased from the\nlist of the living, when he himself was quiet and forever gone, having\nnothing to scheme for, to dread or to hide, he had given his whole\nfortune to the second child! Why?\n\nThe man had all his wits; he must have understood and foreseen that he\nmight, that he almost infallibly must, give grounds for the supposition\nthat the child was his. He was casting obloquy on a woman. How could he\nhave done this if Jean were not his son?\n\nAnd suddenly a clear and fearful recollection shot through his brain.\nMarechal was fair--fair like Jean. He now remembered a little\nminiature portrait he had seen formerly in Paris, on the drawing-room\nchimney-shelf, and which had since disappeared. Where was it? Lost, or\nhidden away? Oh, if he could but have it in his hand for one minute! His\nmother kept it perhaps in the unconfessed drawer where love-tokens were\ntreasured.\n\nHis misery in this thought was so intense that he uttered a groan, one\nof those brief moans wrung from the breast by a too intolerable pang.\nAnd immediately, as if it had heard him, as if it had understood and\nanswered him, the fog-horn on the pier bellowed out close to him. Its\nvoice, like that of a fiendish monster, more resonant than thunder--a\nsavage and appalling roar contrived to drown the clamour of the wind and\nwaves--spread through the darkness, across the sea, which was invisible\nunder its shroud of fog. And again, through the mist, far and near,\nresponsive cries went up to the night. They were terrifying, these calls\ngiven forth by the great blind steam-ships.\n\nThen all was silent once more.\n\nPierre had opened his eyes and was looking about him, startled to find\nhimself here, roused from his nightmare.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am mad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suspect my mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And a surge of love and\nemotion, of repentance, and prayer, and grief, welled up in his heart.\nHis mother! Knowing her as he knew her, how could he ever have suspected\nher? Was not the soul, was not the life of this simple-minded, chaste,\nand loyal woman clearer than water? Could any one who had seen and\nknown her ever think of her but as above suspicion? And he, her son,\nhad doubted her! Oh, if he could but have taken her in his arms at that\nmoment, how he would have kissed and caressed her, and gone on his knees\nto crave pardon.\n\nWould she have deceived his father--she?\n\nHis father!--A very worthy man, no doubt, upright and honest in\nbusiness, but with a mind which had never gone beyond the horizon of his\nshop. How was it that this woman, who must have been very pretty--as he\nknew, and it could still be seen--gifted, too, with a delicate, tender\nemotional soul, could have accepted a man so unlike herself as a suitor\nand a husband? Why inquire? She had married, as young French girls\ndo marry, the youth with a little fortune proposed to her by their\nrelations. They had settled at once in their shop in the Rue Montmartre;\nand the young wife, ruling over the desk, inspired by the feeling of a\nnew home, and the subtle and sacred sense of interests in common which\nfills the place of love, and even of regard, by the domestic hearth of\nmost of the commercial houses of Paris, had set to work, with all her\nsuperior and active intelligence, to make the fortune they hoped for.\nAnd so her life had flowed on, uniform, peaceful and respectable, but\nloveless.\n\nLoveless?--was it possible then that a woman should not love? That\na young and pretty woman, living in Paris, reading books, applauding\nactresses for dying of passion on the stage, could live from youth to\nold age without once feeling her heart touched? He would not believe it\nof any one else; why should she be different from all others, though she\nwas his mother?\n\nShe had been young, with all the poetic weaknesses which agitate the\nheart of a young creature. Shut up, imprisoned in the shop, by the\nside of a vulgar husband who always talked of trade, she had dreamed\nof moonlight nights, of voyages, of kisses exchanged in the shades of\nevening. And then, one day a man had come in, as lovers do in books, and\nhad talked as they talk.\n\nShe had loved him. Why not? She was his mother. What then? Must a man be\nblind and stupid to the point of rejecting evidence because it concerns\nhis mother? But did she give herself to him? Why yes, since this man had\nhad no other love, since he had remained faithful to her when she was\nfar away and growing old. Why yes, since he had left all his fortune to\nhis son--their son!\n\nAnd Pierre started to his feet, quivering with such rage that he longed\nto kill some one. With his arm outstretched, his hand wide open, he\nwanted to hit, to bruise, to smash, to strangle! Whom? Every one; his\nfather, his brother, the dead man, his mother!\n\nHe hurried off homeward. What was he going to do?\n\nAs he passed a turret close to the signal mast the strident howl of the\nfog-horn went off in his very face. He was so startled that he nearly\nfell and shrank back as far as the granite parapet. He sat down\nhalf-stunned by the sudden shock. The steamer which was the first to\nreply seemed to be quite near and was already at the entrance, the tide\nhaving risen.\n\nPierre turned round and could discern its red eye dim through the fog.\nThen, in the broad light of the electric lanterns, a huge black shadow\ncrept up between the piers. Behind him the voice of the look-out man,\nthe hoarse voice of an old retired sea-captain, shouted:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat ship?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And out of the fog the voice of the pilot standing on\ndeck--not less hoarse--replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Santa Lucia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cItaly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat port?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNaples.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd before Pierre's bewildered eyes rose, as he fancied, the fiery\npennon of Vesuvius, while, at the foot of the volcano, fire-flies danced\nin the orange-groves of Sorrento or Castellamare. How often had he\ndreamed of these familiar names as if he knew the scenery. Oh, if he\nmight but go away, now at once, never mind whither, and never come back,\nnever write, never let any one know what had become of him! But no, he\nmust go home--home to his father's house, and go to bed.\n\nHe would not. Come what might he would not go in; he would stay there\ntill daybreak. He liked the roar of the fog-horns. He pulled himself\ntogether and began to walk up and down like an officer on watch.\n\nAnother vessel was coming in behind the other, huge and mysterious. An\nEnglish India-man, homeward bound.\n\nHe saw several more come in, one after another, out of the impenetrable\nvapour. Then, as the damp became quite intolerable, Pierre set out\ntowards the town. He was so cold that he went into a sailors' tavern to\ndrink a glass of grog, and when the hot and pungent liquor had scorched\nhis mouth and throat he felt a hope revive within him.\n\nPerhaps he was mistaken. He knew his own vagabond unreason so well! No\ndoubt he was mistaken. He had piled up the evidence as a charge is drawn\nup against an innocent person, whom it is always so easy to convict when\nwe wish to think him guilty. When he should have slept he would think\ndifferently.\n\nThen he went in and to bed, and by sheer force of will he at last\ndropped asleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nBut the doctor's frame lay scarcely more than an hour or two in the\ntorpor of troubled slumbers. When he awoke in the darkness of his warm,\nclosed room he was aware, even before thought was awake in him, of the\npainful oppression, the sickness of heart which the sorrow we have slept\non leaves behind it. It is as though the disaster of which the shock\nmerely jarred us at first, had, during sleep, stolen into our very\nflesh, bruising and exhausting it like a fever. Memory returned to him\nlike a blow, and he sat up in bed. Then slowly, one by one, he again\nwent through all the arguments which had wrung his heart on the jetty\nwhile the fog-horns were bellowing. The more he thought the less he\ndoubted. He felt himself dragged along by his logic to the inevitable\ncertainty, as by a clutching, strangling hand.\n\nHe was thirsty and hot, his heart beat wildly. He got up to open his\nwindow and breathe the fresh air, and as he stood there a low sound fell\non his ear through the wall. Jean was sleeping peacefully, and gently\nsnoring. He could sleep! He had no presentiment, no suspicions! A man\nwho had known their mother had left him all his fortune; he took the\nmoney and thought it quite fair and natural! He was sleeping, rich and\ncontented, not knowing that his brother was gasping with anguish and\ndistress. And rage boiled up in him against this heedless and happy\nsleeper.\n\nOnly yesterday he would have knocked at his door, have gone in, and\nsitting by the bed, would have said to Jean, scared by the sudden\nwaking:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJean you must not keep this legacy which by to-morrow may have brought\nsuspicion and dishonour on our mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut to-day he could say nothing; he could not tell Jean that he did not\nbelieve him to be their father's son. Now he must guard, must bury the\nshame he had discovered, hide from every eye the stain which he\nhad detected and which no one must perceive, not even his\nbrother--especially not his brother.\n\nHe no longer thought about the vain respect of public opinion. He would\nhave been glad that all the world should accuse his mother if only he,\nhe alone, knew her to be innocent! How could he bear to live with her\nevery day, believing as he looked at her that his brother was the child\nof a stranger's love?\n\nAnd how calm and serene she was, nevertheless, how sure of herself she\nalways seemed! Was it possible that such a woman as she, pure of soul\nand upright in heart, should fall, dragged astray by passion, and\nyet nothing ever appear afterward of her remorse and the stings of a\ntroubled conscience? Ah, but remorse must have tortured her, long ago in\nthe earlier days, and then have faded out, as everything fades. She\nhad surely bewailed her sin, and then, little by little, had almost\nforgotten it. Have not all women, all, this fault of prodigious\nforgetfulness which enables them, after a few years, hardly to recognise\nthe man to whose kisses they have given their lips? The kiss strikes\nlike a thunderbolt, the love passes away like a storm, and then life,\nlike the sky, is calm once more, and begins again as it was before. Do\nwe ever remember a cloud?\n\nPierre could no longer endure to stay in the room! This house, his\nfather's house, crushed him. He felt the roof weigh on his head, and the\nwalls suffocate him. And as he was very thirsty he lighted his candle to\ngo to drink a glass of fresh water from the filter in the kitchen.\n\nHe went down the two flights of stairs; then, as he was coming up again\nwith the water-bottle filled, he sat down, in his night-shirt, on a step\nof the stairs where there was a draught, and drank, without a tumbler,\nin long pulls like a runner who is out of breath. When he ceased to\nmove the silence of the house touched his feelings; then, one by one,\nhe could distinguish the faintest sounds. First there was the ticking of\nthe clock in the dining-room which seemed to grow louder every second.\nThen he heard another snore, an old man's snore, short, laboured, and\nhard, his father beyond doubt; and he writhed at the idea, as if it had\nbut this moment sprung upon him, that these two men, sleeping under the\nsame room--father and son--were nothing to each other! Not a tie, not\nthe very slightest, bound them together, and they did not know it!\nThey spoke to each other affectionately, they embraced each other, they\nrejoiced and lamented together over the same things, just as if the same\nblood flowed in their veins. And two men born at opposite ends of the\nearth could not be more alien to each other than this father and son.\nThey believed they loved each other, because a lie had grown up between\nthem. This paternal love, this filial love, were the outcome of a lie--a\nlie which could not be unmasked, and which no one would ever know but\nhe, the true son.\n\nBut yet, but yet--if he were mistaken? How could he make sure? Oh, if\nonly some likeness, however slight, could be traced between his father\nand Jean, one of those mysterious resemblances which run from an\nancestor to the great-great-grandson, showing that the whole race are\nthe offspring of the same embrace. To him, a medical man, so little\nwould suffice to enable him to discern this--the curve of a nostril, the\nspace between the eyes, the character of the teeth or hair; nay less--a\ngesture, a trick, a habit, an inherited taste, any mark or token which a\npractised eye might recognise as characteristic.\n\nHe thought long, but could remember nothing; no, nothing. But he had\nlooked carelessly, observed badly, having no reason for spying such\nimperceptible indications.\n\nHe got up to go back to his room and mounted the stairs with a slow\nstep, still lost in thought. As he passed the door of his brother's room\nhe stood stock still, his hand put out to open it. An imperative need\nhad just come over him to see Jean at once, to look at him at his\nleisure, to surprise him in his sleep, while the calm countenance and\nrelaxed features were at rest and all the grimace of life put off.\nThus he might catch the dormant secret of his physiognomy, and if any\nappreciable likeness existed it would not escape him.\n\nBut supposing Jean were to wake, what could he say? How could he explain\nthis intrusion?\n\nHe stood still, his fingers clinched on the door-handle, trying to\ndevise a reason, an excuse. Then he remembered that a week ago he had\nlent his brother a phial of laudanum to relieve a fit of toothache. He\nmight himself have been in pain this night and have come to find the\ndrug. So he went in with a stealthy step, like a robber. Jean, his mouth\nopen, was sunk in deep, animal slumbers. His beard and fair hair made a\ngolden patch on the white linen; he did not wake, but he ceased snoring.\n\nPierre, leaning over him, gazed at him with hungry eagerness. No, this\nyoungster was not in the least like Roland; and for the second time the\nrecollection of the little portrait of Marechal, which had vanished,\nrecurred to his mind. He must find it! When he should see it perhaps he\nshould cease to doubt!\n\nHis brother stirred, conscious no doubt of a presence, or disturbed by\nthe light of the taper on his eyelids. The doctor retired on tip-toe to\nthe door which he noiselessly closed; then he went back to his room, but\nnot to bed again.\n\nDay was long in coming. The hours struck one after another on the\ndining-room clock, and its tone was a deep and solemn one, as though the\nlittle piece of clockwork had swallowed a cathedral-bell. The sound rose\nthrough the empty staircase, penetrating through walls and doors, and\ndying away in the rooms where it fell on the torpid ears of the sleeping\nhousehold. Pierre had taken to walking to and fro between his bed and\nthe window. What was he going to do? He was too much upset to spend this\nday at home. He wanted still to be alone, at any rate till the next day,\nto reflect, to compose himself, to strengthen himself for the common\nevery-day life which he must take up again.\n\nWell, he would go over to Trouville to see the swarming crowd on the\nsands. That would amuse him, change the air of his thoughts, and give\nhim time to inure himself to the horrible thing he had discovered.\nAs soon as morning dawned he made his toilet and dressed. The fog had\nvanished and it was fine, very fine. As the boat for Trouville did not\nstart till nine, it struck the doctor that he must greet his mother\nbefore starting.\n\nHe waited till the hour at which she was accustomed to get up, and then\nwent downstairs. His heart beat so violently as he touched her door\nthat he paused for breath. His hand as it lay on the lock was limp and\ntremulous, almost incapable of the slight effort of turning the handle\nto open it. He knocked. His mother's voice inquired:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--Pierre.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly to say good-morning, because I am going to spend the day at\nTrouville with some friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I am still in bed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, do not disturb yourself. I shall see you this evening, when\nI come in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe hoped to get off without seeing her, without pressing on her cheek\nthe false kiss which it made his heart sick to think of. But she\nreplied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. Wait a moment. I will let you in. Wait till I get into bed again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe heard her bare feet on the floor and the sound of the bolt drawn\nback. Then she called out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe went in. She was sitting up in bed, while, by her side, Roland, with\na silk handkerchief by way of night-cap and his face to the wall, still\nlay sleeping. Nothing ever woke him but a shaking hard enough to pull\nhis arm off. On the days when he went fishing it was Josephine, rung up\nby Papagris at the hour fixed, who roused her master from his stubborn\nslumbers.\n\nPierre, as he went towards his mother, looked at her with a sudden sense\nof never having seen her before. She held up her face, he kissed each\ncheek, and then sat down in a low chair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was last evening that you decided on this excursion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, last evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you return to dinner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know. At any rate do not wait for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at her with stupefied curiosity. This woman was his mother!\nAll those features, seen daily from childhood, from the time when his\neye could first distinguish things, that smile, that voice--so well\nknown, so familiar--abruptly struck him as new, different from what they\nhad always been to him hitherto. He understood now that, loving her,\nhe had never looked at her. All the same it was very really she, and he\nknew every little detail of her face; still, it was the first time he\nclearly identified them all. His anxious attention, scrutinizing her\nface which he loved, recalled a difference, a physiognomy he had never\nbefore discerned.\n\nHe rose to go; then, suddenly yielding to the invincible longing to know\nwhich had been gnawing at him since yesterday, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the way, I fancy I remember that you used to have, in Paris, a\nlittle portrait of Marechal, in the drawing-room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe hesitated for a second or two, or at least he fancied she hesitated;\nthen she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat has become of the portrait?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe might have replied more readily:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat portrait--stay; I don't exactly know--perhaps it is in my desk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be kind of you to find it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I will look for it. What do you want it for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it is not for myself. I thought it would be a natural thing to give\nit to Jean, and that he would be pleased to have it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you are right; that is a good idea. I will look for it, as soon as\nI am up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he went out.\n\nIt was a blue day without a breath of wind. The folks in the streets\nseemed in good spirits, the merchants going to business, the clerks\ngoing to their office, the girls going to their shop. Some sang as they\nwent, exhilarated by the bright weather.\n\nThe passengers were already going on board the Trouville boat; Pierre\ntook a seat aft on a wooden bench.\n\nHe asked himself:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow was she uneasy at my asking for the portrait or only surprised? Has\nshe mislaid it, or has she hidden it? Does she know where it is, or does\nshe not? If she had hidden it--why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd his mind, still following up the same line of thought from one\ndeduction to another, came to this conclusion:\n\nThat portrait--of a friend, of a lover, had remained in the drawing-room\nin a conspicuous place, till one day when the wife and mother perceived,\nfirst of all and before any one else, that it bore a likeness to her\nson. Without doubt she had for a long time been on the watch for this\nresemblance; then, having detected it, having noticed its beginnings,\nand understanding that any one might, any day, observe it too, she had\none evening removed the perilous little picture and had hidden it, not\ndaring to destroy it.\n\nPierre recollected quite clearly now that it was long, long before\nthey left Paris that the miniature had vanished. It had disappeared, he\nthought, about the time that Jean's beard was beginning to grow, which\nhad made him suddenly and wonderfully like the fair young man who smiled\nfrom the picture-frame.\n\nThe motion of the boat as it put off disturbed and dissipated his\nmeditations. He stood up and looked at the sea. The little steamer,\nonce outside the piers, turned to the left, and puffing and snorting and\nquivering, made for a distant point visible through the morning haze.\nThe red sail of a heavy fishing-bark, lying motionless on the level\nwaters, looked like a large rock standing up out of the sea. And\nthe Seine, rolling down from Rouen, seemed a wide inlet dividing two\nneighbouring lands. They reached the harbour of Trouville in less than\nan hour, and as it was the time of day when the world was bathing,\nPierre went to the shore.\n\nFrom a distance it looked like a garden full of gaudy flowers. All along\nthe stretch of yellow sand, from the pier as far as the Roches Noires,\nsun-shades of every hue, hats of every shape, dresses of every colour,\nin groups outside the bathing huts, in long rows by the margin of the\nwaves, or scattered here and there, really looked like immense bouquets\non a vast meadow. And the Babel of sounds--voices near and far ringing\nthin in the light atmosphere, shouts and cries of children being bathed,\nclear laughter of women--all made a pleasant, continuous din, mingling\nwith the unheeding breeze, and breathed with the air itself.\n\nPierre walked among all this throng, more lost, more remote from them,\nmore isolated, more drowned in his torturing thoughts, than if he had\nbeen flung overboard from the deck of a ship a hundred miles from shore.\nHe passed by them and heard a few sentences without listening; and he\nsaw, without looking, how the men spoke to the women, and the women\nsmiled at the men. Then, suddenly, as if he had awoke, he perceived them\nall; and hatred of them all surged up in his soul, for they seemed happy\nand content.\n\nNow, as he went, he studied the groups, wandering round them full of a\nfresh set of ideas. All these many-hued dresses which covered the sands\nlike nosegays, these pretty stuffs, those showy parasols, the fictitious\ngrace of tightened waists, all the ingenious devices of fashion from\nthe smart little shoe to the extravagant hat, the seductive charm of\ngesture, voice, and smile, all the coquettish airs in short displayed\non this seashore, suddenly struck him as stupendous efflorescences\nof female depravity. All these bedizened women aimed at pleasing,\nbewitching, and deluding some man. They had dressed themselves out for\nmen--for all men--all excepting the husband whom they no longer needed\nto conquer. They had dressed themselves out for the lover of yesterday\nand the lover of to-morrow, for the stranger they might meet and notice\nor were perhaps on the lookout for.\n\nAnd these men sitting close to them, eye to eye and mouth to mouth,\ninvited them, desired them, hunted them like game, coy and elusive\nnotwithstanding that it seemed so near and so easy to capture. This wide\nshore was, then, no more than a love-market where some sold, others\ngave themselves--some drove a hard bargain for their kisses while others\npromised them for love. All these women thought only of one thing, to\nmake their bodies desirable--bodies already given, sold, or promised\nto other men. And he reflected that it was everywhere the same, all the\nworld over.\n\nHis mother had done what others did--that was all. Others? These women\nhe saw about him, rich, giddy, love-seeking, belonged on the whole to\nthe class of fashionable and showy women of the world, some indeed to\nthe less respectable sisterhood, for on these sands, trampled by the\nlegion of idlers, the tribe of virtuous, home-keeping women were not to\nbe seen.\n\nThe tide was rising, driving the foremost rank of visitors gradually\nlandward. He saw the various groups jump up and fly, carrying their\nchairs with them, before the yellow waves as they rolled up edged with\na lace-like frill of foam. The bathing-machines too were being pulled up\nby horses, and along the planked way which formed the promenade running\nalong the shore from end to end, there was now an increasing flow, slow\nand dense, of well-dressed people in two opposite streams elbowing and\nmingling. Pierre, made nervous and exasperated by this bustle, made his\nescape into the town, and went to get his breakfast at a modest tavern\non the skirts of the fields.\n\nWhen he had finished with coffee, he stretched his legs on a couple of\nchairs under a lime-tree in front of the house, and as he had hardly\nslept the night before, he presently fell into a doze. After resting for\nsome hours he shook himself, and finding that it was time to go on board\nagain he set out, tormented by a sudden stiffness which had come upon\nhim during his long nap. Now he was eager to be at home again; to know\nwhether his mother had found the portrait of Marechal. Would she be the\nfirst to speak of it, or would he be obliged to ask for it again? If she\nwaited to be questioned further it must be because she had some secret\nreason for not showing the miniature.\n\nBut when he was at home again, and in his room, he hesitated about going\ndown to dinner. He was too wretched. His revolted soul had not yet time\nto calm down. However, he made up his mind to it, and appeared in the\ndining-room just as they were sitting down.\n\nAll their faces were beaming.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009care you getting on with your purchases? I do not\nwant to see anything till it is all in its place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd his wife replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes. We are getting on. But it takes much\nconsideration to avoid buying things that do not match. The furniture\nquestion is an absorbing one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had spent the day in going with Jean to cabinet-makers and\nupholsterers. Her fancy was for rich materials, rather splendid to\nstrike the eye at once. Her son, on the contrary, wished for something\nsimple and elegant. So in front of everything put before them they had\neach repeated their arguments. She declared that a client, a defendant,\nmust be impressed; that as soon as he is shown into his counsel's\nwaiting-room he should have a sense of wealth.\n\nJean, on the other hand, wishing to attract only an elegant and opulent\nclass, was anxious to captivate persons of refinement by his quiet and\nperfect taste.\n\nAnd this discussion, which had gone on all day, began again with the\nsoup.\n\nRoland had no opinion. He repeated: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not want to hear anything\nabout it. I will go and see it when it is all finished.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Roland appealed to the judgment of her elder son.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you, Pierre, what do you think of the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis nerves were in a state of such intense excitement that he would have\nliked to reply with an oath. However, he only answered in a dry tone\nquivering with annoyance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I am quite of Jean's mind. I like nothing so well as simplicity,\nwhich, in matters of taste, is equivalent to rectitude in matters of\nconduct.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis mother went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must remember that we live in a city of commercial men, where good\ntaste is not to be met with at every turn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does that matter? Is that a reason for living as fools do? If my\nfellow-townsmen are stupid and ill-bred, need I follow their example? A\nwoman does not misconduct herself because her neighbour has a lover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean began to laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou argue by comparisons which seem to have been borrowed from the\nmaxims of a moralist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre made no reply. His mother and his brother reverted to the\nquestion of stuffs and arm-chairs.\n\nHe sat looking at them as he had looked at his mother in the morning\nbefore starting for Trouville; looking at them as a stranger who would\nstudy them, and he felt as though he had really suddenly come into a\nfamily of which he knew nothing.\n\nHis father, above all, amazed his eyes and his mind. That flabby, burly\nman, happy and besotted, was his own father! No, no; Jean was not in the\nleast like him.\n\nHis family!\n\nWithin these two days an unknown and malignant hand, the hand of a dead\nman, had torn asunder and broken, one by one, all the ties which had\nheld these four human beings together. It was all over, all ruined. He\nhad now no mother--for he could no longer love her now that he could not\nrevere her with that perfect, tender, and pious respect which a son's\nlove demands; no brother--since his brother was the child of a stranger;\nnothing was left him but his father, that coarse man whom he could not\nlove in spite of himself.\n\nAnd he suddenly broke out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, mother, have you found that portrait?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe opened her eyes in surprise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat portrait?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe portrait of Marechal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo--that is to say--yes--I have not found it, but I think I know where\nit is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Roland. And Pierre answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA little likeness of Marechal which used to be in the dining-room in\nParis. I thought that Jean might be glad to have it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, yes, to be sure; I remember it perfectly. I saw it again last\nweek. Your mother found it in her desk when she was tidying the papers.\nIt was on Thursday or Friday. Do you remember, Louise? I was shaving\nmyself when you took it out and laid in on a chair by your side with a\npile of letters of which you burned half. Strange, isn't it, that you\nshould have come across the portrait only two or three days before Jean\nheard of his legacy? If I believed in presentiments I should think that\nthis was one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Roland calmly replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I know where it is. I will fetch it presently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she had lied! When she had said that very morning to her son\nwho had asked her what had become of the miniature: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't exactly\nknow--perhaps it is in my desk\u00e2\u0080\u009d--it was a lie! She had seen it, touched\nit, handled it, gazed at it but a few days since; and then she had\nhidden it away again in the secret drawer with those letters--his\nletters.\n\nPierre looked at the mother who had lied to him; looked at her with\nthe concentrated fury of a son who had been cheated, robbed of his most\nsacred affection, and with the jealous wrath of a man who, after long\nbeing blind, at last discovers a disgraceful betrayal. If he had been\nthat woman's husband--and not her child--he would have gripped her by\nthe wrists, seized her by the shoulders or the hair, have flung her\non the ground, have hit her, hurt her, crushed her! And he might say\nnothing, do nothing, show nothing, reveal nothing. He was her son; he\nhad no vengeance to take. And he had not been deceived.\n\nNay, but she had deceived his tenderness, his pious respect. She owed to\nhim to be without reproach, as all mothers owe it to their children. If\nthe fury that boiled within him verged on hatred it was that he felt her\nto be even more guilty towards him than toward his father.\n\nThe love of man and wife is a voluntary compact in which the one who\nproves weak is guilty only of perfidy; but when the wife is a mother her\nduty is a higher one, since nature has intrusted her with a race. If she\nfails, then she is cowardly, worthless, infamous.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland suddenly, stretching out his legs under\nthe table, as he did every evening while he sipped his glass of\nblack-currant brandy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may do worse than live idle when you have\na snug little income. I hope Jean will have us to dinner in style now.\nHang it all! If I have indigestion now and then I cannot help it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen turning to his wife he added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo and fetch that portrait, little woman, as you have done your dinner.\nI should like to see it again myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe rose, took a taper, and went. Then, after an absence which Pierre\nthought long, though she was not away more than three minutes, Mme.\nRoland returned smiling, and holding an old-fashioned gilt frame by the\nring.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI found it at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor was the first to put forth his hand; he took the picture,\nand holding it a little away from him, he examined it. Then, fully aware\nthat his mother was looking at him, he slowly raised his eyes and fixed\nthem on his brother to compare the faces. He could hardly refrain, in\nhis violence, from saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear me! How like Jean!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And though he dared\nnot utter the terrible words, he betrayed his thought by his manner of\ncomparing the living face with the painted one.\n\nThey had, no doubt, details in common; the same beard, the same brow;\nbut nothing sufficiently marked to justify the assertion: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is\nthe father and that the son.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was rather a family likeness, a\nrelationship of physiognomies in which the same blood courses. But what\nto Pierre was far more decisive than the common aspect of the faces, was\nthat his mother had risen, had turned her back, and was pretending, too\ndeliberately, to be putting the sugar basin and the liqueur bottle\naway in a cupboard. She understood that he knew, or at any rate had his\nsuspicions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHand it on to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland.\n\nPierre held out the miniature and his father drew the candle towards him\nto see it better; then, he murmured in a pathetic tone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor fellow! To think that he was like that when we first knew him!\nCristi! How time flies! He was a good-looking man, too, in those days,\nand with such a pleasant manner--was not he, Louise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs his wife made no answer he went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what an even temper! I never saw him put out. And now it is all at\nan end--nothing left of him--but what he bequeathed to Jean. Well, at\nany rate you may take your oath that that man was a good and faithful\nfriend to the last. Even on his death-bed he did not forget us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean, in his turn, held out his hand for the picture. He gazed at it for\na few minutes and then said regretfully:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not recognise it at all. I only remember him with white hair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe returned the miniature to his mother. She cast a hasty glance at\nit, looking away as if she were frightened; then in her usual voice she\nsaid:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt belongs to you now, my little Jean, as you are his heir. We will\ntake it to your new rooms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And when they went into the drawing-room\nshe placed the picture on the chimney-shelf by the clock, where it had\nformerly stood.\n\nRoland filled his pipe; Pierre and Jean lighted cigarettes. They\ncommonly smoked them, Pierre while he paced the room, Jean, sunk in a\ndeep arm-chair, with his legs crossed. Their father always sat astride a\nchair and spat from afar into the fire-place.\n\nMme. Roland, on a low seat by a little table on which the lamp stood,\nembroidered, or knitted, or marked linen.\n\nThis evening she was beginning a piece of worsted work, intended\nfor Jean's lodgings. It was a difficult and complicated pattern, and\nrequired all her attention. Still, now and again, her eye, which was\ncounting the stitches, glanced up swiftly and furtively at the little\nportrait of the dead as it leaned against the clock. And the doctor, who\nwas striding to and fro across the little room in four or five steps,\nmet his mother's look at each turn.\n\nIt was as though they were spying on each other; and acute uneasiness,\nintolerable to be borne, clutched at Pierre's heart. He was saying to\nhimself--at once tortured and glad:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe must be in misery at this moment if she knows that I guess!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And\neach time he reached the fire-place he stopped for a few seconds to look\nat Marechal's fair hair, and show quite plainly that he was haunted by\na fixed idea. So that this little portrait, smaller than an opened palm,\nwas like a living being, malignant and threatening, suddenly brought\ninto this house and this family.\n\nPresently the street-door bell rang. Mme. Roland, always so\nself-possessed, started violently, betraying to her doctor son the\nanguish of her nerves. Then she said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be Mme. Rosemilly;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nher eye again anxiously turned to the mantel-shelf.\n\nPierre understood, or thought he understood, her fears and misery.\nA woman's eye is keen, a woman's wit is nimble, and her instincts\nsuspicious. When this woman who was coming in should see the miniature\nof a man she did not know, she might perhaps at the first glance\ndiscover the likeness between this face and Jean. Then she would know\nand understand everything.\n\nHe was seized with dread, a sudden and horrible dread of this shame\nbeing unveiled, and, turning about just as the door opened, he took the\nlittle painting and slipped it under the clock without being seen by his\nfather and brother.\n\nWhen he met his mother's eyes again they seemed to him altered, dim, and\nhaggard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood evening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mme. Rosemilly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have come to ask you for a cup\nof tea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut while they were bustling about her and asking after her health,\nPierre made off, the door having been left open.\n\nWhen his absence was perceived they were all surprised. Jean, annoyed\nfor the young widow, who, he thought, would be hurt, muttered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a\nbear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Roland replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must not be vexed with him; he is not very\nwell to-day and tired with his excursion to Trouville.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is no reason for taking himself off\nlike a savage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Rosemilly tried to smooth matters by saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all, not at\nall. He has gone away in the English fashion; people always disappear in\nthat way in fashionable circles if they want to leave early.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, in fashionable circles, I dare say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Jean. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut a man does\nnot treat his family _a l'Anglaise_, and my brother has done nothing\nelse for some time past.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nFor a week or two nothing occurred. The father went fishing; Jean, with\nhis mother's help, was furnishing and settling himself; Pierre, very\ngloomy, never was seen excepting at meal-times.\n\nHis father having asked him one evening: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy the deuce do you always\ncome in with a face as cheerful as a funeral? This is not the first time\nI have remarked it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact is I am terribly conscious of the burden\nof life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man did not have a notion what he meant, and with an aggrieved\nlook he went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt really is too bad. Ever since we had the good luck\nto come into this legacy, every one seems unhappy. It is as though some\naccident had befallen us, as if we were in mourning for some one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am in mourning for some one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pierre.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are? For whom?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor some one you never knew, and of whom I was too fond.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland imagined that his son alluded to some girl with whom he had had\nsome love passages, and he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA woman, I suppose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, a woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. Worse. Ruined!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThough he was startled by this unexpected confidence, in his wife's\npresence too, and by his son's strange tone about it, the old man made\nno further inquiries, for in his opinion such affairs did not concern a\nthird person.\n\nMme. Roland affected not to hear; she seemed ill and was very pale.\nSeveral times already her husband, surprised to see her sit down as if\nshe were dropping into her chair, and to hear her gasp as if she could\nnot draw her breath, had said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, Louise, you look very ill; you tire yourself too much with\nhelping Jean. Give yourself a little rest. Sacristi! The rascal is in no\nhurry, as he is a rich man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shook her head without a word.\n\nBut to-day her pallor was so great that Roland remarked on it again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis will not do at all, my dear old woman. You\nmust take care of yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, addressing his son, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou surely must\nsee that your mother is ill. Have you questioned her, at any rate?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; I had not noticed that there was anything the\nmatter with her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this Roland was angry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it stares you in the face, confound you! What on earth is the good\nof your being a doctor if you cannot even see that your mother is out of\nsorts? Why, look at her, just look at her. Really, a man might die under\nhis very eyes and this doctor would never think there was anything the\nmatter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Roland was panting for breath, and so white that her husband\nexclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is going to faint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, it is nothing--I shall get better directly--it is nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre had gone up to her and was looking at her steadily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat ails you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. And she repeated in an undertone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing, nothing--I assure you, nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland had gone to fetch some vinegar; he now returned, and handing the\nbottle to his son he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere--do something to ease her. Have you felt her heart?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs Pierre bent over her to feel her pulse she pulled away her hand so\nvehemently that she struck it against a chair which was standing by.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he in icy tones, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me see what I can do for you, as you\nare ill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she raised her arm and held it out to him. Her skin was burning,\nthe blood throbbing in short irregular leaps.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are certainly ill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must take something to quiet\nyou. I will write you a prescription.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as he wrote, stooping over\nthe paper, a low sound of choked sighs, smothered, quick breathing and\nsuppressed sobs made him suddenly look round at her. She was weeping,\nher hands covering her face.\n\nRoland, quite distracted, asked her:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLouise, Louise, what is the mater with you? What on earth ails you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not answer, but seemed racked by some deep and dreadful grief.\nHer husband tried to take her hands from her face, but she resisted him,\nrepeating:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, no.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe appealed to his son.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what is the matter with her? I never saw her like this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pierre, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is a little hysterical.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he felt as if it were a comfort to him to see her suffering thus,\nas if this anguish mitigated his resentment and diminished his mother's\nload of opprobrium. He looked at her as a judge satisfied with his day's\nwork.\n\nSuddenly she rose, rushed to the door with such a swift impulse that it\nwas impossible to forestall or to stop her, and ran off to lock herself\ninto her room.\n\nRoland and the doctor were left face to face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you make head or tail of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the father.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a little nervous disturbance, not\nalarming or surprising; such attacks may very likely recur from time to\ntime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey did in fact recur, almost every day; and Pierre seemed to bring\nthem on with a word, as if he had the clew to her strange and new\ndisorder. He would discern in her face a lucid interval of peace and\nwith the willingness of a torturer would, with a word, revive the\nanguish that had been lulled for a moment.\n\nBut he, too, was suffering as cruelly as she. It was dreadful pain to\nhim that he could no longer love her nor respect her, that he must put\nher on the rack. When he had laid bare the bleeding wound which he had\nopened in her woman's, her mother's heart, when he felt how wretched and\ndesperate she was, he would go out alone, wander about the town, so torn\nby remorse, so broken by pity, so grieved to have thus hammered her with\nhis scorn as her son, that he longed to fling himself into the sea and\nput an end to it all by drowning himself.\n\nAh! How gladly now would he have forgiven her. But he could not, for he\nwas incapable of forgetting. If only he could have desisted from making\nher suffer; but this again he could not, suffering as he did himself. He\nwent home to his meals, full of relenting resolutions; then, as soon as\nhe saw her, as soon as he met her eye--formerly so clear and frank, now\nso evasive, frightened, and bewildered--he struck at her in spite of\nhimself, unable to suppress the treacherous words which would rise to\nhis lips.\n\nThis disgraceful secret, known to them alone, goaded him up against her.\nIt was as a poison flowing in his veins and giving him an impulse to\nbite like a mad dog.\n\nAnd there was no one in the way now to hinder his reading her; Jean\nlived almost entirely in his new apartments, and only came home to\ndinner and to sleep every night at his father's.\n\nHe frequently observed his brother's bitterness and violence, and\nattributed them to jealousy. He promised himself that some day he would\nteach him his place and give him a lesson, for life at home was becoming\nvery painful as a result of these constant scenes. But as he now lived\napart he suffered less from this brutal conduct, and his love of peace\nprompted him to patience. His good fortune, too, had turned his head,\nand he scarcely paused to think of anything which had no direct interest\nfor himself. He would come in full of fresh little anxieties, full of\nthe cut of a morning-coat, of the shape of a felt hat, of the proper\nsize for his visiting-cards. And he talked incessantly of all the\ndetails of his house--the shelves fixed in his bed-room cupboard to keep\nlinen on, the pegs to be put up in the entrance hall, the electric bells\ncontrived to prevent illicit visitors to his lodgings.\n\nIt had been settled that on the day when he should take up his abode\nthere they should make an excursion to Saint Jouin, and return after\ndining there, to drink tea in his rooms. Roland wanted to go by water,\nbut the distance and the uncertainty of reaching it in a sailing boat if\nthere should be a head-wind, made them reject his plan, and a break was\nhired for the day.\n\nThey set out at ten to get there to breakfast. The dusty high road lay\nacross the plain of Normandy, which, by its gentle undulations, dotted\nwith farms embowered in trees, wears the aspect of an endless park. In\nthe vehicle, as it jogged on at the slow trot of a pair of heavy horses,\nsat the four Rolands, Mme. Rosemilly, and Captain Beausire, all silent,\ndeafened by the rumble of the wheels, and with their eyes shut to keep\nout the clouds of dust.\n\nIt was harvest-time. Alternating with the dark hue of clover and the raw\ngreen of beet-root, the yellow corn lighted up the landscape with gleams\nof pale gold; the fields looked as if they had drunk in the sunshine\nwhich poured down on them. Here and there the reapers were at work,\nand in the plots where the scythe had been put in the men might be seen\nsee-sawing as they swept the level soil with the broad, wing-shaped\nblade.\n\nAfter a two-hours' drive the break turned off to the left, past a\nwindmill at work--a melancholy, gray wreck, half rotten and doomed, the\nlast survivor of its ancient race; then it went into a pretty inn yard,\nand drew up at the door of a smart little house, a hostelry famous in\nthose parts.\n\nThe mistress, well known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cLa belle Alphonsine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d came smiling to the\nthreshold, and held out her hand to the two ladies who hesitated to take\nthe high step.\n\nSome strangers were already at breakfast under a tent by a grass-plot\nshaded by apple trees--Parisians, who had come from Etretat; and from\nthe house came sounds of voices, laughter, and the clatter of plates and\npans.\n\nThey were to eat in a room, as the outer dining-halls were all full.\nRoland suddenly caught sight of some shrimping nets hanging against the\nwall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! ha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou catch prawns here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Beausire. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed it is the place on all the coast where\nmost are taken.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst-rate! Suppose we try to catch some after breakfast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs it happened it would be low tide at three o'clock, so it was settled\nthat they should all spend the afternoon among the rocks, hunting\nprawns.\n\nThey made a light breakfast, as a precaution against the tendency of\nblood to the head when they should have their feet in the water. They\nalso wished to reserve an appetite for dinner, which had been ordered on\na grand scale and to be ready at six o'clock when they came in.\n\nRoland could not sit still for impatience. He wanted to buy the nets\nspecially constructed for fishing prawns, not unlike those used for\ncatching butterflies in the country. Their name on the French coast is\n_lanets_; they are netted bags on a circular wooden frame, at the end of\na long pole. Alphonsine, still smiling, was happy to lend them. Then she\nhelped the two ladies to make an impromptu change of toilet, so as\nnot to spoil their dresses. She offered them skirts, coarse worsted\nstockings and hemp shoes. The men took off their socks and went to the\nshoemaker's to buy wooden shoes instead.\n\nThen they set out, the nets over their shoulders and creels on their\nbacks. Mme. Rosemilly was very sweet in this costume, with an unexpected\ncharm of countrified audacity. The skirt which Alphonsine had lent her,\ncoquettishly tucked up and firmly stitched so as to allow of her running\nand jumping fearlessly on the rocks, displayed her ankle and lower\ncalf--the firm calf of a strong and agile little woman. Her dress was\nloose to give freedom to her movements, and to cover her head she\nhad found an enormous garden hat of coarse yellow straw with an\nextravagantly broad brim; and to this, a bunch of tamarisk pinned in to\ncock it on one side, gave a very dashing and military effect.\n\nJean, since he had come into his fortune, had asked himself every day\nwhether or no he should marry her. Each time he saw her he made up his\nmind to ask her to be his wife, and then, as soon as he was alone again,\nhe considered that by waiting he would have time to reflect. She was now\nless rich than he, for she had but twelve thousand francs a year; but it\nwas in real estate, in farms and lands near the docks in Havre; and\nthis by-and-bye might be worth a great deal. Their fortunes were\nthus approximately equal, and certainly the young widow attracted him\ngreatly.\n\nAs he watched her walking in front of him that day he said to himself:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must really decide; I cannot do better, I am sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey went down a little ravine, sloping from the village to the cliff,\nand the cliff, at the end of this comb, rose about eighty metres above\nthe sea. Framed between the green slopes to the right and left, a great\ntriangle of silvery blue water could be seen in the distance, and a\nsail, scarcely visible, looked like an insect out there. The sky, pale\nwith light, was so merged into one with the water that it was impossible\nto see where one ended and the other began; and the two women, walking\nin front of the men, stood out against the bright background, their\nshapes clearly defined in their closely-fitting dresses.\n\nJean, with a sparkle in his eye, watched the smart ankle, the neat leg,\nthe supple waist, and the coquettish broad hat of Mme. Rosemilly as they\nfled away from him. And this flight fired his ardour, urging him on to\nthe sudden determination which comes to hesitating and timid natures.\nThe warm air, fragrant with sea-coast odours--gorse, clover, and thyme,\nmingling with the salt smell of the rocks at low tide--excited him still\nmore, mounting to his brain; and every moment he felt a little more\ndetermined, at every step, at every glance he cast at the alert figure;\nhe made up his mind to delay no longer, to tell her that he loved her\nand hoped to marry her. The prawn-fishing would favour him by affording\nhim an opportunity; and it would be a pretty scene too, a pretty spot\nfor love-making--their feet in a pool of limpid water while they watched\nthe long feelers of the shrimps lurking under the wrack.\n\nWhen they had reached the end of the comb and the edge of the cliff,\nthey saw a little footpath slanting down the face of it; and below them,\nabout half-way between the sea and the foot of the precipice, an amazing\nchaos of enormous boulders tumbled over and piled one above the other\non a sort of grassy and undulating plain which extended as far as they\ncould see to the southward, formed by an ancient landslip. On this long\nshelf of brushwood and grass, disrupted, as it seemed, by the shocks\nof a volcano, the fallen rocks seemed the wreck of a great ruined city\nwhich had once looked out on the ocean, sheltered by the long white wall\nof the overhanging cliff.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is fine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Mme. Rosemilly, standing still. Jean had come\nup with her, and with a beating heart offered his hand to help her down\nthe narrow steps cut in the rock.\n\nThey went on in front, while Beausire, squaring himself on his little\nlegs, gave his arm to Mme. Roland, who felt giddy at the gulf before\nher.\n\nRoland and Pierre came last, and the doctor had to drag his father down,\nfor his brain reeled so that he could only slip down sitting, from step\nto step.\n\nThe two young people who led the way went fast till on a sudden they\nsaw, by the side of a wooden bench which afforded a resting-place about\nhalf-way down the slope, a thread of clear water, springing from a\ncrevice in the cliff. It fell into a hollow as large as a washing basin\nwhich it had worn in the stone; then, falling in a cascade, hardly two\nfeet high, it trickled across the footpath which it had carpeted with\ncresses, and was lost among the briers and grass on the raised shelf\nwhere the boulders were piled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I am so thirsty!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mme. Rosemilly.\n\nBut how could she drink? She tried to catch the water in her hand, but\nit slipped away between her fingers. Jean had an idea; he placed a stone\non the path and on this she knelt down to put her lips to the spring\nitself, which was thus on the same level.\n\nWhen she raised her head, covered with myriads of tiny drops, sprinkled\nall over her face, her hair, her eye-lashes, and her dress, Jean bent\nover her and murmured: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow pretty you look!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe answered in the tone in which she might have scolded a child:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you be quiet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese were the first words of flirtation they had ever exchanged.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jean, much agitated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us go on before they come up with\nus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor in fact they could see quite near them now Captain Beausire as\nhe came down, backward, so as to give both hands to Mme. Roland; and\nfurther up, further off, Roland still letting himself slip, lowering\nhimself on his hams and clinging on with his hands and elbows at\nthe speed of a tortoise, Pierre keeping in front of him to watch his\nmovements.\n\nThe path, now less steep, was here almost a road, zigzagging between the\nhuge rocks which had at some former time rolled from the hill-top. Mme.\nRosemilly and Jean set off at a run and they were soon on the beach.\nThey crossed it and reached the rocks, which stretched in a long and\nflat expanse covered with sea-weed, and broken by endless gleaming\npools. The ebbed waters lay beyond, very far away, across this plain of\nslimy weed, of a black and shining olive green.\n\nJean rolled up his trousers above his calf, and his sleeves to his\nelbows, that he might get wet without caring; then saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cForward!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nleaped boldly into the first tide-pool they came to.\n\nThe lady, more cautious, though fully intending to go in too, presently,\nmade her way round the little pond, stepping timidly, for she slipped on\nthe grassy weed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you see anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I see your face reflected in the water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that is all you see, you will not have good fishing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe murmured tenderly in reply:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf all fishing it is that I should like best to succeed in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe laughed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTry; you will see how it will slip through your net.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut yet--if you will?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will see you catch prawns--and nothing else--for the moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are cruel--let us go a little farther, there are none here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe gave her his hand to steady her on the slippery rocks. She leaned on\nhim rather timidly, and he suddenly felt himself overpowered by love and\ninsurgent with passion, as if the fever that had been incubating in him\nhad waited till to-day to declare its presence.\n\nThey soon came to a deeper rift, in which long slender weeds,\nfantastically tinted, like floating green and rose-coloured hair, were\nswaying under the quivering water as it trickled off to the distant sea\nthrough some invisible crevice.\n\nMme. Rosemilly cried out: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, look, I see one, a big one. A very\nbig one, just there!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He saw it too, and stepped boldly into the pool,\nthough he got wet up to the waist. But the creature, waving its long\nwhiskers, gently retired in front of the net. Jean drove it towards the\nsea-weed, making sure of his prey. When it found itself blockaded it\nrose with a dart over the net, shot across the mere, and was gone. The\nyoung woman, who was watching the chase in great excitement, could not\nhelp exclaiming: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! Clumsy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was vexed, and without a moment's thought dragged his net over a hole\nfull of weed. As he brought it to the surface again he saw in it three\nlarge transparent prawns, caught blindfold in their hiding-place.\n\nHe offered them in triumph to Mme. Rosemilly, who was afraid to touch\nthem, for fear of the sharp, serrated crest which arms their heads.\nHowever, she made up her mind to it, and taking them up by the tip of\ntheir long whiskers she dropped them one by one into her creel, with a\nlittle seaweed to keep them alive. Then, having found a shallower pool\nof water, she stepped in with some hesitation, for the cold plunge of\nher feet took her breath away, and began to fish on her own account. She\nwas dextrous and artful, with the light hand and the hunter's instinct\nwhich are indispensable. At almost every dip she brought up some prawns,\nbeguiled and surprised by her ingeniously gentle pursuit.\n\nJean now caught nothing; but he followed her, step by step, touched\nher now and again, bent over her, pretended great distress at his own\nawkwardness, and besought her to teach him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShow me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he kept saying. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShow me how.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then, as their two faces were reflected side by side in water so\nclear that the black weeds at the bottom made a mirror, Jean smiled at\nthe face which looked up at him from the depth, and now and then from\nhis finger-tips blew it a kiss which seemed to light upon it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! how tiresome you are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear fellow, you should\nnever do two things at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am only doing one--loving you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe drew herself up and said gravely:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat has come over you these ten minutes; have you lost your wits?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I have not lost my wits. I love you, and at last I dare to tell you\nso.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey were at this moment both standing in the salt pool wet half-way up\nto their knees and with dripping hands, holding their nets. They looked\ninto each other's eyes.\n\nShe went on in a tone of amused annoyance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow very ill-advised to tell me here and now! Could you not wait till\nanother day instead of spoiling my fishing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cForgive me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I could not longer hold my peace. I\nhave loved you a long time. To-day you have intoxicated me and I lost my\nreason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen suddenly she seemed to have resigned herself to talk business and\nthink no more of pleasure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us sit down on that stone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe can talk more\ncomfortably.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They scrambled up a rather high boulder, and when they had\nsettled themselves side by side in the bright sunshine, she began again:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy good friend, you are no longer a child, and I am not a young girl.\nwe both know perfectly well what we are about and we can weigh the\nconsequences of our actions. If you have made up your mind to make love\nto me to-day I must naturally infer that you wish to marry me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was not prepared for this matter-of-fact statement of the case, and\nhe answered blandly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, yes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you mentioned it to your father and mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I wanted to know first whether you would accept me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe held out her hand, which was still wet, and as he eagerly clasped\nit:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am ready and willing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe you to be kind and\ntrue-hearted. But remember, I should not like to displease your\nparents.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, do you think that my mother has never foreseen it, or that she\nwould not be as fond of you as she is if she did not hope that you and I\nshould marry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is true. I am a little disturbed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey said no more. He, for his part, was amazed at her being so little\ndisturbed, so rational. He had expected pretty little flirting ways,\nrefusals which meant yes, a whole coquettish comedy of love chequered\nby prawn-fishing in the splashing water. And it was all over; he was\npledged, married with twenty words. They had no more to say about it\nsince they were agreed, and they now sat, both somewhat embarrassed by\nwhat had so swiftly passed between them; a little perplexed, indeed, not\ndaring to speak, not daring to fish, not knowing what to do.\n\nRoland's voice rescued them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis way, this way, children. Come and watch Beausire. The fellow is\npositively clearing out the sea!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe captain had, in fact, had a wonderful haul. Wet above his hips he\nwaded from pool to pool, recognizing the likeliest spots at a glance,\nand searching all the hollows hidden under sea-weed, with a steady\nslow sweep of his net. And the beautiful transparent, sandy-gray prawns\nskipped in his palm as he picked them out of the net with a dry jerk\nand put them into his creel. Mme. Rosemilly, surprised and delighted,\nremained at his side, almost forgetful of her promise to Jean, who\nfollowed them in a dream, giving herself up entirely to the childish\nenjoyment of pulling the creatures out from among the waving\nsea-grasses.\n\nRoland suddenly exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, here comes Mme. Roland to join us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had remained at first on the beach with Pierre, for they had neither\nof them any wish to play at running about among the rocks and paddling\nin the tide-pools; and yet they had felt doubtful about staying\ntogether. She was afraid of him, and her son was afraid of her and of\nhimself; afraid of his own cruelty which he could not control. But they\nsat down side by side on the stones. And both of them, under the heat of\nthe sun, mitigated by the sea-breeze, gazing at the wide, fair horizon\nof blue water streaked and shot with silver, thought as if in unison:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow delightful this would have been--once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not venture to speak to Pierre, knowing that he would return\nsome hard answer; and he dared not address his mother, knowing that\nin spite of himself he should speak violently. He sat twitching the\nwater-worn pebbles with the end of his cane, switching them and turning\nthem over. She, with a vague look in her eyes, had picked up three or\nfour little stones and was slowly and mechanically dropping them from\none hand into the other. Then her unsettled gaze, wandering over the\nscene before her, discerned, among the weedy rocks, her son Jean fishing\nwith Mme. Rosemilly. She looked at them, watching their movements, dimly\nunderstanding, with motherly instinct, that they were talking as they\ndid not talk every day. She saw them leaning over side by side when they\nlooked into the water, standing face to face when they questioned their\nhearts, then scrambled up the rock and seated themselves to come to an\nunderstanding. Their figures stood out very sharply, looking as if they\nwere alone in the middle of the wide horizon, and assuming a sort of\nsymbolic dignity in that vast expanse of sky and sea and cliff.\n\nPierre, too, was looking at them, and a harsh laugh suddenly broke form\nhis lips. Without turning to him Mme. Roland said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke with a sneer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am learning. Learning how a man lays himself out to be cozened by his\nwife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe flushed with rage, exasperated by the insinuation she believed was\nintended.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn whose name do you say that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Jean's, by Heaven! It is immensely funny to see those two.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe murmured in a low voice, tremulous with feeling: \u00e2\u0080\u009cO Pierre, how\ncruel you are! That woman is honesty itself. Your brother could not find\na better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe laughed aloud, a hard, satirical laugh:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa! hah! Hah! Honesty itself! All wives are honesty itself--and all\nhusbands are--betrayed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he shouted with laughter.\n\nShe made no reply, but rose, hastily went down the sloping beach, and\nat the risk of tumbling into one of the rifts hidden by the sea-weed, of\nbreaking a leg or an arm, she hastened, almost running, plunging through\nthe pools without looking, straight to her other son.\n\nSeeing her approach, Jean called out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, mother? So you have made the effort?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWithout a word she seized him by the arm, as if to say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSave me,\nprotect me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe saw her agitation, and greatly surprised he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow pale you are! What is the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe stammered out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was nearly falling; I was frightened at the rocks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo then Jean guided her, supported her, explained the sport to her that\nshe might take an interest in it. But as she scarcely heeded him, and as\nhe was bursting with the desire to confide in some one, he led her away\nand in a low voice said to her:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGuess what I have done!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut--what--I don't know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGuess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot. I don't know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I have told Mme. Rosemilly that I wish to marry her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not answer, for her brain was buzzing, her mind in such distress\nthat she could scarcely take it in. She echoed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. Have I done well? She is charming, do not you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, charming. You have done very well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you approve?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I approve.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how strangely you say so! I could fancy that--that you were not\nglad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, indeed, I am--very glad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally and truly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally and truly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd to prove it she threw her arms round him and kissed him heartily,\nwith warm motherly kisses. Then, when she had wiped her eyes, which\nwere full of tears, she observed upon the beach a man lying flat at full\nlength like a dead body, his face hidden against the stones; it was the\nother one, Pierre, sunk in thought and desperation.\n\nAt this she led her little Jean farther away, quite to the edge of the\nwaves, and there they talked for a long time of this marriage on which\nhe had set his heart.\n\nThe rising tide drove them back to rejoin the fishers, and then they\nall made their way to the shore. They roused Pierre, who pretended to\nbe sleeping; and then came a long dinner washed down with many kinds of\nwine.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIn the break, on their way home, all the men dozed excepting Jean.\nBeausire and Roland dropped every five minutes on to a neighbour's\nshoulder which repelled them with a shove. Then they sat up, ceased\nto snore, opened their eyes, muttered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lovely evening!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and almost\nimmediately fell over on the other side.\n\nBy the time they reached Havre their drowsiness was so heavy that they\nhad great difficulty in shaking it off, and Beausire even refused to go\nto Jean's rooms where tea was waiting for them. He had to be set down at\nhis own door.\n\nThe young lawyer was to sleep in his new abode for the first time; and\nhe was full of rather puerile glee which had suddenly come over him, at\nbeing able, that very evening, to show his betrothed the rooms she was\nso soon to inhabit.\n\nThe maid had gone to bed, Mme. Roland having declared that she herself\nwould boil the water and make the tea, for she did not like the servants\nto be kept up for fear of fire.\n\nNo one had yet been into the lodgings but herself, Jean, and the\nworkmen, that the surprise might be the greater at their being so\npretty.\n\nJean begged them all to wait a moment in the ante-room. He wanted to\nlight the lamps and candles, and he left Mme. Rosemilly in the dark with\nhis father and brother; then he cried: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in!\u00e2\u0080\u009d opening the double\ndoor to its full width.\n\nThe glass gallery, lighted by a chandelier and little coloured lamps\nhidden among palms, india-rubber plants, and flowers, was first seen\nlike a scene on the stage. There was a spasm of surprise. Roland,\ndazzled by such luxury, muttered an oath, and felt inclined to clap his\nhands as if it were a pantomime scene. They then went into the first\ndrawing-room, a small room hung with dead gold and furnished to match.\nThe larger drawing-room--the lawyer's consulting-room, very simple, hung\nwith light salmon-colour--was dignified in style.\n\nJean sat down in his arm-chair in front of his writing-table loaded with\nbooks, and in a solemn, rather stilted tone, he began:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, madame, the letter of the law is explicit, and, assuming the\nconsent I promised you, it affords me absolute certainty that the matter\nwe discussed will come to a happy conclusion within three months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at Mme. Rosemilly, who began to smile and glanced at Mme.\nRoland. Mme. Roland took her hand and pressed it. Jean, in high spirits,\ncut a caper like a school-boy, exclaiming: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHah! How well the voice\ncarries in this room; it would be capital for speaking in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he declaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf humanity alone, if the instinct of natural benevolence which we feel\ntowards all who suffer, were the motive of the acquittal we expect of\nyou, I should appeal to your compassion, gentlemen of the jury, to your\nhearts as fathers and as men; but we have law on our side, and it is the\npoint of law only which we shall submit to your judgment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre was looking at this home which might have been his, and he was\nrestive under his brother's frolics, thinking him really too silly and\nwitless.\n\nMme. Roland opened a door on the right.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the bed-room,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\nShe had devoted herself to its decoration with all her mother's love.\nThe hangings were of Rouen cretonne imitating old Normandy chintz, and\nthe Louis XV. design--a shepherdess, in a medallion held in the beaks\nof a pair of doves--gave the walls, curtains, bed, and arm-chairs a\nfestive, rustic style that was extremely pretty!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, how charming!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mme. Rosemilly exclaimed, becoming a little serious\nas they entered the room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you like it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Jean.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cImmensely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot imagine how glad I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey looked at each other for a second, with confiding tenderness in the\ndepths of their eyes.\n\nShe had felt a little awkward, however, a little abashed, in this room\nwhich was to be hers. She noticed as she went in that the bed was a\nlarge one, quite a family bed, chosen by Mme. Roland, who had no doubt\nforeseen and hoped that her son should soon marry; and this motherly\nforesight pleased her, for it seemed to tell her that she was expected\nin the family.\n\nWhen they had returned to the drawing-room Jean abruptly threw open the\ndoor to the left, showing the circular dining-room with three windows,\nand decorated to imitate a Chinese lantern. Mother and son had here\nlavished all the fancy of which they were capable, and the room, with\nits bamboo furniture, its mandarins, jars, silk hangings glistening\nwith gold, transparent blinds threaded with beads looking like drops\nof water, fans nailed to the wall to drape the hangings on, screens,\nswords, masks, cranes made of real feathers, and a myriad trifles\nin china, wood, paper, ivory, mother-of-pearl, and bronze, had\nthe pretentious and extravagant aspect which unpractised hands and\nuneducated eyes inevitably stamp on things which need the utmost tact,\ntaste, and artistic education. Nevertheless it was the most admired;\nonly Pierre made some observations with rather bitter irony which hurt\nhis brother's feelings.\n\nPyramids of fruit stood on the table and monuments of cakes. No one was\nhungry; they picked at the fruit and nibbled at the cakes rather than\nate them. Then, at the end of about an hour, Mme. Rosemilly begged to\ntake leave. It was decided that old Roland should accompany her home and\nset out with her forthwith; while Mme. Roland, in the maid's absence,\nshould cast a maternal eye over the house and see that her son had all\nhe needed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShall I come back for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Roland.\n\nShe hesitated a moment and then said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, dear old man; go to bed.\nPierre will see me home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs soon as they were gone she blew out the candles, locked up the cakes,\nthe sugar, and liqueurs in a cupboard of which she gave the key to Jean;\nthen she went into the bed-room, turned down the bed, saw that there\nwas fresh water in the water-bottle, and that the window was properly\nclosed.\n\nPierre and Jean had remained in the little outer drawing-room; the\nyounger still sore under the criticism passed on his taste, and the\nelder chafing more and more at seeing his brother in this abode. They\nboth sat smoking without a word. Pierre suddenly started to his feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCristi!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe widow looked very jaded this evening. Long\nexcursions do not improve her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean felt his spirit rising with one of those sudden and furious rages\nwhich boil up in easy-going natures when they are wounded to the quick.\nHe could hardly find breath to speak, so fierce was his excitement, and\nhe stammered out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI forbid you ever again to say 'the widow' when you speak of Mme.\nRosemilly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre turned on him haughtily:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are giving me an order, I believe. Are you gone mad by any chance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean had pulled himself up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not gone mad, but I have had enough of your manners to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre sneered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo you? And are you any part of Mme. Rosemilly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are to know that Mme. Rosemilly is about to become my wife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre laughed the louder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! ha! very good. I understand now why I should no longer speak of\nher as 'the widow.' But you have taken a strange way of announcing your\nengagement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI forbid any jesting about it. Do you hear? I forbid it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean had come close up to him, pale, and his voice quivering with\nexasperation at this irony levelled at the woman he loved and had\nchosen.\n\nBut on a sudden Pierre turned equally furious. All the accumulation of\nimpotent rage, of suppressed malignity, of rebellion choked down for so\nlong past, all his unspoken despair mounted to his brain, bewildering it\nlike a fit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow dare you? How dare you? I order you to hold your tongue--do you\nhear? I order you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean, startled by his violence, was silent for a few seconds, trying\nin the confusion of mind which comes of rage to hit on the thing, the\nphrase, the word, which might stab his brother to the heart. He went on,\nwith an effort to control himself that he might aim true, and to speak\nslowly that the words might hit more keenly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have known for a long time that you were jealous of me, ever since\nthe day when you first began to talk of 'the widow' because you knew it\nannoyed me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre broke into one of those strident and scornful laughs which were\ncommon with him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! ah! Good Heavens! Jealous of you! I? I? And of what? Good God! Of\nyour person or your mind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Jean knew full well that he had touched the wound in his soul.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, jealous of me--jealous from your childhood up. And it became fury\nwhen you saw that this woman liked me best and would have nothing to say\nto you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre, stung to the quick by this assumption, stuttered out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI? I? Jealous of you? And for the sake of that goose, that gaby, that\nsimpleton?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean, seeing that he was aiming true, went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how about the day when you tried to pull me round in the Pearl?\nAnd all you said in her presence to show off? Why, you are bursting\nwith jealousy! And when this money was left to me you were maddened, you\nhated me, you showed it in every possible way, and made every one suffer\nfor it; not an hour passes that you do not spit out the bile that is\nchoking you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre clenched his fist in his fury with an almost irresistible impulse\nto fly at his brother and seize him by the throat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold your tongue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least say nothing about that money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy your jealousy oozes out at every pore. You never say a word to my\nfather, my mother, or me that does not declare it plainly. You pretend\nto despise me because you are jealous. You try to pick a quarrel with\nevery one because you are jealous. And now that I am rich you can no\nlonger contain yourself; you have become venomous, you torture our poor\nmother as if she were to blame!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre had retired step by step as far as the fire-place, his mouth half\nopen, his eyes glaring, a prey to one of those mad fits of passion in\nwhich a crime is committed.\n\nHe said again in a lower tone, gasping for breath: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHold your\ntongue--for God's sake hold your tongue!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo! For a long time I have been wanting to give you my whole mind! You\nhave given me an opening--so much the worse for you. I love the woman;\nyou know it, and laugh her to scorn in my presence--so much the worse\nfor you. But I will break your viper's fangs, I tell you. I will make\nyou treat me with respect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith respect--you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes--me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRespect you? You who have brought shame on us all by your greed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou say--? Say it again--again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say that it does not do to accept one man's fortune when another is\nreputed to be your father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean stood rigid, not understanding, dazed by the insinuation he\nscented.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat? Repeat that once more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say--what everybody is muttering, what every gossip is blabbing--that\nyou are the son of the man who left you his fortune. Well, then--a\ndecent man does not take the money which brings dishonour on his\nmother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPierre! Pierre! Pierre! Think what you are saying. You? Is it you who\ngive utterance to this infamous thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I. It is I. Have you not seen me crushed with woe this month past,\nspending my nights without sleep and my days in lurking out of sight\nlike an animal? I hardly know what I am doing or what will become of\nme, so miserable am I, so crazed with shame and grief; for first I\nguessed--and now I know it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPierre! Be silent. Mother is in the next room. Remember she may\nhear--she must hear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Pierre felt that he must unburden his heart. He told Jean all his\nsuspicions, his arguments, his struggles, his assurance, and the history\nof the portrait--which had again disappeared. He spoke in short broken\nsentences almost without coherence--the language of a sleep-walker.\n\nHe seemed to have quite forgotten Jean, and his mother in the adjoining\nroom. He talked as if no one were listening, because he must talk,\nbecause he had suffered too much and smothered and closed the wound\ntoo tightly. It had festered like an abscess and the abscess had burst,\nsplashing every one. He was pacing the room in the way he almost always\ndid, his eyes fixed on vacancy, gesticulating in a frenzy of despair,\nhis voice choked with tearless sobs and revulsions of self-loathing; he\nspoke as if he were making a confession of his own misery and that\nof his nearest kin, as though he were casting his woes to the deaf,\ninvisible winds which bore away his words.\n\nJean, distracted and almost convinced on a sudden by his brother's blind\nvehemence, was leaning against the door behind which, as he guessed,\ntheir mother had heard them.\n\nShe could not get out, she must come through his room. She had not come;\nthen it was because she dare not.\n\nSuddenly Pierre stamped his foot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a brute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto have told you this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he fled, bare-headed, down the stairs.\n\nThe noise of the front-door closing with a slam roused Jean from the\ndeep stupor into which he had fallen. Some seconds had elapsed, longer\nthan hours, and his spirit had sunk into the numb torpor of idiocy.\nHe was conscious, indeed, that he must presently think and act, but he\nwould wait, refusing to understand, to know, to remember, out of\nfear, weakness, cowardice. He was one of those procrastinators who put\neverything off till to-morrow; and when he was compelled to come to\na decision then and there, still he instinctively tried to gain a few\nminutes.\n\nBut the perfect silence which now reigned, after Pierre's vociferations,\nthe sudden stillness of walls and furniture, with the bright light of\nsix wax candles and two lamps, terrified him so greatly that he suddenly\nlonged to make his escape too.\n\nThen he roused his brain, roused his heart, and tried to reflect.\n\nNever in his life had he had to face a difficulty. There are men who let\nthemselves glide onward like running water. He had been duteous over his\ntasks for fear of punishment, and had got through his legal studies\nwith credit because his existence was tranquil. Everything in the world\nseemed to him quite natural and never aroused his particular attention.\nHe loved order, steadiness, and peace, by temperament, his nature having\nno complications; and face to face with this catastrophe, he found\nhimself like a man who has fallen into the water and cannot swim.\n\nAt first he tried to be incredulous. His brother had told a lie, out of\nhatred and jealousy. But yet, how could he have been so vile as to say\nsuch a thing of their mother if he had not himself been distraught by\ndespair? Besides, stamped on Jean's ear, on his sight, on his nerves,\non the inmost fibres of his flesh, were certain words, certain tones of\nanguish, certain gestures of Pierre's, so full of suffering that they\nwere irresistibly convincing; as incontrovertible as certainty itself.\n\nHe was too much crushed to stir or even to will. His distress became\nunbearable; and he knew that behind the door was his mother who had\nheard everything and was waiting.\n\nWhat was she doing? Not a movement, not a shudder, not a breath, not a\nsigh revealed the presence of a living creature behind that panel. Could\nshe have run away? But how? If she had run away--she must have jumped\nout of the window into the street. A shock of terror roused him--so\nviolent and imperious that he drove the door in rather than opened it,\nand flung himself into the bed-room.\n\nIt was apparently empty, lighted by a single candle standing on the\nchest of drawers.\n\nJean flew to the window; it was shut and the shutters bolted. He looked\nabout him, peering into the dark corners with anxious eyes, and he then\nnoticed that the bed-curtains were drawn. He ran forward and opened\nthem. His mother was lying on the bed, her face buried in the pillow\nwhich she had pulled up over her ears that she might hear no more.\n\nAt first he thought she had smothered herself. Then, taking her by the\nshoulders, he turned her over without her leaving go of the pillow,\nwhich covered her face, and in which she had set her teeth to keep\nherself from crying out.\n\nBut the mere touch of this rigid form, of those arms so convulsively\nclinched, communicated to him the shock of her unspeakable torture. The\nstrength and determination with which she clutched the linen case full\nof feathers with her hands and teeth, over her mouth and eyes and ears,\nthat he might neither see her nor speak to her, gave him an idea, by the\nturmoil it roused in him, of the pitch suffering may rise to, and his\nheart, his simple heart, was torn with pity. He was no judge, not he;\nnot even a merciful judge; he was a man full of weakness and a son full\nof love. He remembered nothing of what his brother had told him;\nhe neither reasoned nor argued, he merely laid his two hands on his\nmother's inert body, and not being able to pull the pillow away, he\nexclaimed, kissing her dress:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, mother, my poor mother, look at me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe would have seemed to be dead but that an almost imperceptible\nshudder ran through all her limbs, the vibration of a strained cord. And\nhe repeated:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, mother, listen to me. It is not true. I know that it is not\ntrue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA spasm seemed to come over her, a fit of suffocation; then she suddenly\nbegan to sob into the pillow. Her sinews relaxed, her rigid muscles\nyielded, her fingers gave way and left go of the linen; and he uncovered\nher face.\n\nShe was pale, quite colourless; and from under her closed lids tears\nwere stealing. He threw his arms round her neck and kissed her eyes,\nslowly, with long heart-broken kisses, wet with her tears; and he said\nagain and again:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, my dear mother, I know it is not true. Do not cry; I know it.\nIt is not true.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe raised herself, she sat up, looked in his face, and with an effort\nof courage such as it must cost in some cases to kill one's self, she\nsaid:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my child; it is true.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd they remained speechless, each in the presence of the other. For\nsome minutes she seemed again to be suffocating, craning her throat\nand throwing back her head to get breath; then she once more mastered\nherself and went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true, my child. Why lie about it? It is true. You would not\nbelieve me if I denied it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked like a crazy creature. Overcome by alarm, he fell on his\nknees by the bedside, murmuring:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush, mother, be silent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She stood up with terrible determination and\nenergy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have nothing more to say, my child. Good-bye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And she went towards\nthe door.\n\nHe threw his arms about her exclaiming:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doing, mother; where are you going?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know. How should I know--There is nothing left for me to do,\nnow that I am alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe struggled to be released. Holding her firmly, he could find only\nwords to say again and again:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, mother, mother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And through all her efforts to free herself\nshe was saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no. I am not your mother now, poor boy--good-bye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt struck him clearly that if he let her go now he should never see her\nagain; lifting her up in his arms he carried her to an arm-chair, forced\nher into it, and kneeling down in front of her barred her in with his\narms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall not quit this spot, mother. I love you and I will keep you! I\nwill keep you always--I love you and you are mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe murmured in a dejected tone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my poor boy, it is impossible. You weep to-night, but to-morrow you\nwould turn me out of the house. You, even you, could not forgive me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI? I? How little you know me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d with such a burst of genuine\naffection that, with a cry, she seized his head by the hair with both\nhands, and dragging him violently to her kissed him distractedly all\nover his face.\n\nThen she sat still, her cheek against his, feeling the warmth of his\nskin through his beard, and she whispered in his ear: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my little\nJean, you would not forgive me to-morrow. You think so, but you deceive\nyourself. You have forgiven me this evening, and that forgiveness has\nsaved my life; but you must never see me again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he repeated, clasping her in his arms:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, do not say that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my child, I must go away. I do not know where, nor how I shall set\nabout it, nor what I shall do; but it must be done. I could never look\nat you, nor kiss you, do you understand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he in his turn spoke into her ear:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy little mother, you are to stay, because I insist, because I want\nyou. And you must pledge your word to obey me, now, at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my child.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, mother, you must; do you hear? You must.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my child, it is impossible. It would be condemning us all to the\ntortures of hell. I know what that torment is; I have known it this\nmonth past. Your feelings are touched now, but when that is over,\nwhen you look on me as Pierre does, when you remember what I have told\nyou--oh, my Jean, think--think--I am your mother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not let you leave me, mother. I have no one but you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut think, my son, we can never see each other again without both of us\nblushing, without my feeling that I must die of shame, without my eyes\nfalling before yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it is not so, mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, yes, it is so! Oh, I have understood all your poor brother's\nstruggles, believe me! All--from the very first day. Now, when I hear\nhis step in the house my heart beats as if it would burst, when I\nhear his voice I am ready to faint. I still had you; now I have you no\nlonger. Oh, my little Jean! Do you think I could live between you two?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I should love you so much that you would cease to think of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs if that were possible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it is possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you suppose that I could cease to think of it, with your brother\nand you on each hand? Would you cease to think of it, I ask you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI? I swear I should.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy you would think of it at every hour of the day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I swear it. Besides, listen, if you go away I will enlist and get\nkilled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis boyish threat quite overcame her; she clasped Jean in a passionate\nand tender embrace. He went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI love you more than you think--ah, much more, much more. Come, be\nreasonable. Try to stay for only one week. Will you promise me one week?\nYou cannot refuse me that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe laid her two hands on Jean's shoulders, and holding him at arm's\nlength she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy child, let us try and be calm and not give way to emotions. First,\nlisten to me. If I were ever to hear from your lips what I have heard\nfor this month past from your brother, if I were once to see in your\neyes what I read in his, if I could fancy from a word or a look that I\nwas as odious to you as I am to him--within one hour, mark me--within\none hour I should be gone forever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, I swear to you--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me speak. For a month past I have suffered all that any creature\ncan suffer. From the moment when I perceived that your brother, my other\nson, suspected me, that as the minutes went by, he guessed the truth,\nevery moment of my life has been a martyrdom which no words could tell\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer voice was so full of woe that the contagion of her misery brought\nthe tears to Jean's eyes.\n\nHe tried to kiss her, but she held him off.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLeave me--listen; I still have so much to say to make you understand.\nBut you never can understand. You see, if I stayed--I must--no, no. I\ncannot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak on, mother, speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, indeed, for at least I shall not have deceived you. You want me to\nstay with you? For what--for us to be able to see each other, speak to\neach other, meet at any hour of the day at home, for I no longer dare\nopen a door for fear of finding your brother behind it. If we are to\ndo that, you must not forgive me--nothing is so wounding as\nforgiveness--but you must owe me no grudge for what I have done. You\nmust feel yourself strong enough, and so far unlike the rest of the\nworld, as to be able to say to yourself that you are not Roland's son\nwithout blushing for the fact or despising me. I have suffered enough--I\nhave suffered too much; I can bear no more, no indeed, no more! And it\nis not a thing of yesterday, mind you, but of long, long years. But you\ncould never understand that; how should you! If you and I are to live\ntogether and kiss each other, my little Jean, you must believe that\nthough I was your father's mistress I was yet more truly his wife, his\nreal wife; that, at the bottom of my heart, I cannot be ashamed of it;\nthat I have no regrets; that I love him still even in death; that I\nshall always love him and never loved any other man; that he was my\nlife, my joy, my hope, my comfort, everything--everything in the world\nto me for so long! Listen, my boy, before God, who hears me, I should\nnever have had a joy in my existence if I had not met him; never\nanything--not a touch of tenderness or kindness, not one of those hours\nwhich make us regret growing old--nothing. I owe everything to him! I\nhad but him in the world, and you two boys, your brother and you. But\nfor you, all would have been empty, dark, and void as the night. I\nshould never have loved, or known, or cared for anything--I should not\neven have wept--for I have wept, my little Jean; oh, yes, and bitter\ntears, since we came to Havre. I was his wholly and forever; for ten\nyears I was as much his wife as he was my husband before God who created\nus for each other. And then I began to see that he loved me less. He was\nalways kind and courteous, but I was not what I had been to him. It\nwas all over! Oh, how I have cried! How dreadful and delusive life is!\nNothing lasts. Then we came here--I never saw him again; he never came.\nHe promised it in every letter. I was always expecting him, and I never\nsaw him again--and now he is dead! But he still cared for us since he\nremembered you. I shall love him to my latest breath, and I never will\ndeny him, and I love you because you are his child, and I could never\nbe ashamed of him before you. Do you understand? I could not. So if you\nwish me to remain you must accept the situation as his son, and we will\ntalk of him sometimes; and you must love him a little and we must think\nof him when we look at each other. If you will not do this--if you\ncannot--then good-bye, my child; it is impossible that we should live\ntogether. Now, I will act by your decision.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean replied gently:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStay, mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe clasped him in her arms, and her tears flowed again; then, with her\nface against his, she went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, but Pierre. What can we do about Pierre?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will find some plan! You cannot live with him any longer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the thought of her elder son she was convulsed with terror.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I cannot; no, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And throwing herself on Jean's breast she cried\nin distress of mind:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSave me from him, you, my little one. Save me; do something--I don't\nknow what. Think of something. Save me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, mother, I will think of something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd at once. You must, this minute. Do not leave me. I am so afraid of\nhim--so afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes; I will hit on some plan. I promise you I will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut at once; quick, quick! You cannot imagine what I feel when I see\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she murmured softly in his ear: \u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep me here, with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe paused, reflected, and with his blunt good-sense saw at once the\ndangers of such an arrangement. But he had to argue for a long time,\ncombating her scared, terror-stricken insistence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly for to-night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly for to-night. And to-morrow morning\nyou can send word to Roland that I was taken ill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is out of the question, as Pierre left you here. Come, take\ncourage. I will arrange everything, I promise you, to-morrow; I will\nbe with you by nine o'clock. Come, put on your bonnet. I will take you\nhome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will do just what you desire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said with a childlike impulse of\ntimidity and gratitude.\n\nShe tried to rise, but the shock had been too much for her; she could\nnot stand.\n\nHe made her drink some sugared water and smell at some salts, while\nhe bathed her temples with vinegar. She let him do what he would,\nexhausted, but comforted, as after the pains of child-birth. At last she\ncould walk and she took his arm. The town hall struck three as they went\npast.\n\nOutside their own door Jean kissed her, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night, mother, keep up your courage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe stealthily crept up the silent stairs, and into her room,\nundressed quickly, and slipped into bed with a reawakened sense of that\nlong-forgotten sin. Roland was snoring. In all the house Pierre alone\nwas awake, and had heard her come in.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nWhen he got back to his lodgings Jean dropped on a sofa; for the sorrows\nand anxieties which made his brother long to be moving, and to flee\nlike a hunted prey, acted differently on his torpid nature and broke the\nstrength of his arms and legs. He felt too limp to stir a finger, even\nto get to bed; limp body and soul, crushed and heart-broken. He had\nnot been hit, as Pierre had been, in the purity of filial love, in the\nsecret dignity which is the refuge of a proud heart; he was overwhelmed\nby a stroke of fate which, at the same time, threatened his own nearest\ninterests.\n\nWhen at last his spirit was calmer, when his thoughts had settled\nlike water that has been stirred and lashed, he could contemplate the\nsituation which had come before him. If he had learned the secret of his\nbirth through any other channel he would assuredly have been very wroth\nand very deeply pained, but after his quarrel with his brother, after\nthe violent and brutal betrayal which had shaken his nerves, the\nagonizing emotion of his mother's confession had so bereft him of energy\nthat he could not rebel. The shock to his feeling had been so great as\nto sweep away in an irresistible tide of pathos, all prejudice, and all\nthe sacred delicacy of natural morality. Besides, he was not a man made\nfor resistance. He did not like contending against any one, least of\nall against himself, so he resigned himself at once; and by instinctive\ntendency, a congenital love of peace, and of an easy and tranquil life,\nhe began to anticipate the agitations which must surge up around him and\nat once be his ruin. He foresaw that they were inevitable, and to avert\nthem he made up his mind to superhuman efforts of energy and activity.\nThe knot must be cut immediately, this very day; for even he had fits of\nthat imperious demand for a swift solution which is the only strength\nof weak natures, incapable of a prolonged effort of will. His lawyer's\nmind, accustomed as it was to disentangling and studying complicated\nsituations and questions of domestic difficulties in families that had\ngot out of gear, at once foresaw the more immediate consequences of his\nbrother's state of mind. In spite of himself, he looked at the issue\nfrom an almost professional point of view, as though he had to legislate\nfor the future relations of certain clients after a moral disaster.\nConstant friction against Pierre had certainly become unendurable. He\ncould easily evade it, no doubt, by living in his own lodgings; but even\nthen it was not possible that their mother should live under the same\nroof with her elder son. For a long time he sat meditating, motionless,\non the cushions, devising and rejecting various possibilities, and\nfinding nothing that satisfied him.\n\nBut suddenly an idea took him by storm. This fortune which had come to\nhim. Would an honest man keep it?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the first immediate answer, and he made up his mind that it\nmust go to the poor. It was hard, but it could not be helped. He would\nsell his furniture and work like any other man, like any other beginner.\nThis manful and painful resolution spurred his courage; he rose and went\nto the window, leaning his forehead against the pane. He had been poor;\nhe could become poor again. After all he should not die of it. His eyes\nwere fixed on the gas lamp burning at the opposite side of the street.\nA woman, much belated, happened to pass; suddenly he thought of Mme.\nRosemilly with a pang at his heart, the shock of deep feeling which\ncomes of a cruel suggestion. All the dire results of his decision rose\nup before him together. He would have to renounce his marriage, renounce\nhappiness, renounce everything. Could he do such a thing after having\npledged himself to her? She had accepted him knowing him to be rich.\nShe would take him still if he were poor; but had he any right to demand\nsuch a sacrifice? Would it not be better to keep this money in trust, to\nbe restored to the poor at some future date.\n\nAnd in his soul, where selfishness put on a guise of honesty, all these\nspecious interests were struggling and contending. His first scruples\nyielded to ingenious reasoning, then came to the top again, and again\ndisappeared.\n\nHe sat down again, seeking some decisive motive, some all-sufficient\npretext to solve his hesitancy and convince his natural rectitude.\nTwenty times over had he asked himself this question: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince I am this\nman's son, since I know and acknowledge it, is it not natural that I\nshould also accept the inheritance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut even this argument could not suppress the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured by his\ninmost conscience.\n\nThen came the thought: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince I am not the son of the man I always\nbelieved to be my father, I can take nothing from him, neither during\nhis lifetime nor after his death. It would be neither dignified nor\nequitable. It would be robbing my brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis new view of the matter having relieved him and quieted his\nconscience, he went to the window again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must give up my share of the family\ninheritance. I must let Pierre have the whole of it, since I am not his\nfather's son. That is but just. Then is it not just that I should keep\nmy father's money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving discerned that he could take nothing of Roland's savings, having\ndecided on giving up the whole of this money, he agreed; he resigned\nhimself to keeping Marechal's; for if he rejected both he would find\nhimself reduced to beggary.\n\nThis delicate question being thus disposed of he came back to that of\nPierre's presence in the family. How was he to be got rid of? He was\ngiving up his search for any practical solution when the whistle of a\nsteam-vessel coming into port seemed to blow him an answer by suggesting\na scheme.\n\nThen he threw himself on his bed without undressing, and dozed and\ndreamed till daybreak.\n\nAt a little before nine he went out to ascertain whether his plans were\nfeasible. Then, after making sundry inquiries and calls, he went to his\nold home. His mother was waiting for him in her room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you had not come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should never have dared to go down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a minute Roland's voice was heard on the stairs: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre we to have\nnothing to eat to-day, hang it all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was no answer, and he roared out, with a thundering oath this\ntime: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJosephine, what the devil are you about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe girl's voice came up from the depths of the basement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, M'sieu--what is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is your Miss'es?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadame is upstairs with M'sieu Jean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he shouted, looking up at the higher floor: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLouise!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Roland half opened her door and answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it, my dear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre we to have nothing to eat to-day, hang it all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, my dear, I am coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she went down, followed by Jean.\n\nRoland, as soon as he saw him, exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHallo! There you are! Sick of your home already?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, father, but I had something to talk over with mother this morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean went forward holding out his hand, and when he felt his fingers\nin the old man's fatherly clasp, a strange, unforeseen emotion thrilled\nthrough him, and a sense as of parting and farewell without return.\n\nMme. Roland asked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPierre is not come down?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer husband shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, but never mind him; he is always behind-hand. We will begin without\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned to Jean:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had better go to call him, my child; it hurts his feelings if we do\nnot wait for him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, mother. I will go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the young man went. He mounted the stairs with the fevered\ndetermination of a man who is about to fight a duel and who is in a\nfright. When he knocked at the door Pierre said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe went in. The elder was writing, leaning over his table.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jean.\n\nPierre rose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morning!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and they shook hands as if nothing had occurred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you not coming down to breakfast?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell--you see--I have a good deal to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The elder brother's voice was\ntremulous, and his anxious eye asked his younger brother what he meant\nto do.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are waiting for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! There is--is my mother down?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it was she who sent me to fetch you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, very well; then I will come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the door of the dining-room he paused, doubtful about going in first;\nthen he abruptly opened the door and saw his father and mother seated at\nthe table opposite each other.\n\nHe went straight up to her without looking at her or saying a word, and\nbending over her, offered his forehead for her to kiss, as he had done\nfor some time past, instead of kissing her on both cheeks as of old.\nHe supposed that she put her lips near but he did not feel them on his\nbrow, and he straightened himself with a throbbing heart after this\nfeint of a caress. And he wondered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did they say to each other after I had left?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean constantly addressed her tenderly as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdear mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n took care of her, waited on her, and poured out her wine.\n\nThen Pierre understood that they had wept together, but he could not\nread their minds. Did Jean believe in his mother's guilt, or think his\nbrother a base wretch?\n\nAnd all his self-reproach for having uttered the horrible thing came\nupon him again, choking his throat and his tongue, and preventing his\neither eating or speaking.\n\nHe was now a prey to an intolerable desire to fly, to leave the house\nwhich was his home no longer, and these persons who were bound to him by\nsuch imperceptible ties. He would gladly have been off that moment,\nno matter whither, feeling that everything was over, that he could not\nendure to stay with them, that his presence was torture to them, and\nthat they would bring on him incessant suffering too great to endure.\nJean was talking, chatting with Roland. Pierre, as he did not listen,\ndid not hear. But he presently was aware of a pointed tone in his\nbrother's voice and paid more attention to his words. Jean was saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will be the finest ship in their fleet. They say she is of 6,500\ntons. She is to make her first trip next month.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland was amazed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo soon? I thought she was not to be ready for sea this summer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. The work has been pushed forward very vigorously, to get her\nthrough her first voyage before the autumn. I looked in at the Company's\noffice this morning, and was talking to one of the directors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed! Which of them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cM. Marchand, who is a great friend of the Chairman of the Board.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! Do you know him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. And I wanted to ask him a favour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you will get me leave to go over every part of the Lorraine as\nsoon as she comes into port?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure; nothing could be easier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Jean seemed to hesitate, to be weighing his words, and to want to\nlead up to a difficult subject. He went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the whole, life is very endurable on board those great Transatlantic\nliners. More than half the time is spent on shore in two splendid\ncities--New York and Havre; and the remainder at sea with delightful\ncompany. In fact, very pleasant acquaintances are sometimes made among\nthe passengers, and very useful in after-life--yes, really very useful.\nOnly think, the captain, with his perquisites on coal, can make as much\nas twenty-five thousand francs a year or more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland muttered an oath followed by a whistle, which testified to his\ndeep respect for the sum and the captain.\n\nJean went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe purser makes as much as ten thousand, and the doctor has a fixed\nsalary of five thousand, with lodgings, keep, light, firing, service,\nand everything, which makes it up to ten thousand at least. That is very\ngood pay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre raising his eyes met his brother's and understood.\n\nThen, after some hesitation, he asked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it very hard to get a place as medical man on board a Transatlantic\nliner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes--and no. It all depends on circumstances and recommendation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a long pause; then the doctor began again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext month, you say, the Lorraine is to sail?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. On the 7th.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd they said nothing more.\n\nPierre was considering. It certainly would be a way out of many\ndifficulties if he could embark as medical officer on board the\nsteamship. By-and-by he could see; he might perhaps give it up.\nMeanwhile he would be gaining a living, and asking for nothing from his\nparents. Only two days since he had been forced to sell his watch, for\nhe would no longer hold out his hand to beg of his mother. So he had no\nother resource left, no opening to enable him to eat the bread of any\nhouse but this which had become uninhabitable, or sleep in any other\nbed, or under any other roof. He presently said, with some little\nhesitation:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I could, I would very gladly sail in her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean asked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat should hinder you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know no one in the Transatlantic Shipping Company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland was astounded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what has become of all your fine schemes for getting on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre replied in a low voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are times when we must bring ourselves to sacrifice everything\nand renounce our fondest hopes. And after all it is only to make a\nbeginning, a way of saving a few thousand francs to start fair with\nafterward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis father was promptly convinced.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is very true. In a couple of years you can put by six or seven\nthousand francs, and that well laid out, will go a long way. What do you\nthink of the matter, Louise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe replied in a voice so low as to be scarcely audible:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Pierre is right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go and talk it over with M. Poulin: I know him very well. He is\nassessor of the Chamber of Commerce and takes an interest in the\naffairs of the Company. There is M. Lenient, too, the ship-owner, who is\nintimate with one of the vice-chairmen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean asked his brother:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you like me to feel my way with M. Marchand at once?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I should be very glad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter thinking a few minutes Pierre added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best thing I can do, perhaps, will be to write to my professors at\nthe college of Medicine, who had a great regard for me. Very inferior\nmen are sometimes shipped on board those vessels. Letters of strong\nrecommendation from such professors as Mas-Roussel, Remusot, Flanche,\nand Borriquel would do more for me in an hour than all the doubtful\nintroductions in the world. It would be enough if your friend M.\nMarchand would lay them before the board.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean approved heartily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour idea is really capital.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he smiled, quite reassured, almost\nhappy, sure of success and incapable of allowing himself to be unhappy\nfor long.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will write to-day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDirectly. Now; at once. I will go and do so. I do not care for any\ncoffee this morning; I am too nervous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe rose and left the room.\n\nThen Jean turned to his mother:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you, mother, what are you going to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing. I do not know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you come with me to call on Mme. Rosemilly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, yes--yes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know I must positively go to see her to-day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes. To be sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy must you positively?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Roland, whose habit it was never to\nunderstand what was said in his presence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I promised her I would.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, very well. That alters the case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he began to fill his pipe,\nwhile the mother and son went upstairs to make ready.\n\nWhen they were in the street Jean said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you take my arm, mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was never accustomed to offer it, for they were in the habit of\nwalking side by side. She accepted and leaned on him.\n\nFor some time they did not speak; then he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see that Pierre is quite ready and willing to go away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe murmured:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor boy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why 'poor boy'? He will not be in the least unhappy on board the\nLorraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo--I know. But I was thinking of so many things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she thought for a long time, her head bent, accommodating her step\nto her son's; then, in the peculiar voice in which we sometimes\ngive utterance to the conclusion of long and secret meditations, she\nexclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow horrible life is! If by any chance we come across any sweetness\nin it, we sin in letting ourselves be happy, and pay dearly for it\nafterward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe said in a whisper:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not speak of that any more, mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that possible? I think of nothing else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will forget it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgain she was silent; then with deep regret she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow happy I might have been, married to another man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was visiting it on Roland now, throwing all the responsibility of\nher sin on his ugliness, his stupidity, his clumsiness, the heaviness of\nhis intellect, and the vulgarity of his person. It was to this that it\nwas owing that she had betrayed him, had driven one son to desperation,\nand had been forced to utter to the other the most agonizing confession\nthat can make a mother's heart bleed. She muttered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is so frightful\nfor a young girl to have to marry such a husband as mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean made no reply. He was thinking of the man he had hitherto believed\nto be his father; and possibly the vague notion he had long since\nconceived, of that father's inferiority, with his brother's constant\nirony, the scornful indifference of others, and the very maid-servant's\ncontempt for Roland, had somewhat prepared his mind for his mother's\nterrible avowal. It had all made it less dreadful to him to find that\nhe was another man's son; and if, after the great shock and agitation\nof the previous evening, he had not suffered the reaction of rage,\nindignation, and rebellion which Mme. Roland had feared, it was because\nhe had long been unconsciously chafing under the sense of being the\nchild of this well-meaning lout.\n\nThey had now reached the dwelling of Mme. Rosemilly.\n\nShe lived on the road to Sainte-Adresse, on the second floor of a large\ntenement which she owned. The windows commanded a view of the whole\nroadstead.\n\nOn seeing Mme. Roland, who entered first, instead of merely holding out\nher hands as usual, she put her arms round her and kissed her, for she\ndivined the purpose of her visit.\n\nThe furniture of this drawing-room, all in stamped velvet, was always\nshrouded in chair-covers. The walls, hung with flowered paper, were\ngraced by four engravings, the purchase of her late husband, the\ncaptain. They represented sentimental scenes of seafaring life. In the\nfirst a fisherman's wife was seen, waving a handkerchief on shore, while\nthe vessel which bore away her husband vanished on the horizon. In the\nsecond the same woman, on her knees on the same shore, under a sky shot\nwith lightning, wrung her arms as she gazed into the distance at her\nhusband's boat which was going to the bottom amid impossible waves.\n\nThe others represented similar scenes in a higher rank of society. A\nyoung lady with fair hair, resting her elbows on the ledge of a large\nsteamship quitting the shore, gazed at the already distant coast with\neyes full of tears and regret. Whom is she leaving behind?\n\nThen the same young lady sitting by an open widow with a view of the\nsea, had fainted in an arm-chair; a letter she had dropped lay at her\nfeet. So he is dead! What despair!\n\nVisitors were generally much moved and charmed by the commonplace pathos\nof these obvious and sentimental works. They were at once intelligible\nwithout question or explanation, and the poor women were to be pitied,\nthough the nature of the grief of the more elegant of the two was not\nprecisely known. But this very doubt contributed to the sentiment.\nShe had, no doubt, lost her lover. On entering the room the eye\nwas immediately attracted to these four pictures, and riveted as if\nfascinated. If it wandered it was only to return and contemplate the\nfour expressions on the faces of the two women, who were as like each\nother as two sisters. And the very style of these works, in their\nshining frames, crisp, sharp, and highly finished, with the elegance of\na fashion plate, suggested a sense of cleanliness and propriety which\nwas confirmed by the rest of the fittings. The seats were always in\nprecisely the same order, some against the wall and some round the\ncircular centre-table. The immaculately white curtains hung in such\nstraight and regular pleats that one longed to crumple them a little;\nand never did a grain of dust rest on the shade under which the gilt\nclock, in the taste of the first empire--a terrestrial globe supported\nby Atlas on his knees--looked like a melon left there to ripen.\n\nThe two women as they sat down somewhat altered the normal position of\ntheir chairs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have not been out this morning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mme. Roland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. I must own to being rather tired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she spoke as if in gratitude to Jean and his mother, of all the\npleasure she had derived from the expedition and the prawn-fishing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ate my prawns this morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand they were excellent. If\nyou felt inclined we might go again one of these days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young man interrupted her:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore we start on a second fishing excursion, suppose we complete the\nfirst?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cComplete it? It seems to me quite finished.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, madame, I, for my part, caught something on the rocks of Saint\nJouain which I am anxious to carry home with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe put on an innocent and knowing look.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou? What can it be? What can you have found?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA wife. And my mother and I have come to ask you whether she had\nchanged her mind this morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe smiled: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, monsieur. I never change my mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then he held out his hand, wide open, and she put hers into it with\na quick, determined movement. Then he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs soon as possible, I\nhope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs soon as you like.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn six weeks?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no opinion. What does my future mother-in-law say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Roland replied with a rather melancholy smile:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI? Oh, I can say nothing. I can only thank you for having accepted\nJean, for you will make him very happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will do our best, mamma.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSomewhat overcome, for the first time, Mme. Rosemilly rose, and throwing\nher arms round Mme. Roland, kissed her a long time as a child of her own\nmight have done; and under this new embrace the poor woman's sick heart\nswelled with deep emotion. She could not have expressed the feeling;\nit was at once sad and sweet. She had lost her son, her big boy, but in\nreturn she had found a daughter, a grown-up daughter.\n\nWhen they faced each other again, and were seated, they took hands and\nremained so, looking at each and smiling, while they seemed to have\nforgotten Jean.\n\nThen they discussed a number of things which had to be thought of in\nview of an early marriage, and when everything was settled and decided\nMme. Rosemilly seemed suddenly to remember a further detail and asked:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have consulted M. Roland, I suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA flush of colour mounted at the same instant on the face of both mother\nand son. It was the mother who replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no, it is quite unnecessary!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then she hesitated, feeling that\nsome explanation was needed, and added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do everything without saying\nanything to him. It is enough to tell him what we have decided on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Rosemilly, not in the least surprised, only smiled, taking it as a\nmatter of course, for the good man counted for so little.\n\nWhen Mme. Roland was in the street again with her son she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose we go to your rooms for a little while. I should be glad to\nrest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe felt herself homeless, shelterless, her own house being a terror to\nher.\n\nThey went into Jean's apartments.\n\nAs soon as the door was closed upon her she heaved a deep sigh, as if\nthat bolt had placed her in safety, but then, instead of resting as she\nhad said, she began to open the cupboards, to count the piles of linen,\nthe pocket-handkerchiefs, and socks. She changed the arrangement to\nplace them in more harmonious order, more pleasing to her housekeeper's\neye; and when she had put everything to her mind, laying out the towels,\nthe shirts, and the drawers on their several shelves and dividing all\nthe linen into three principal classes, body-linen, household-linen, and\ntable-linen, she drew back and contemplated the results, and called out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome here, Jean, and see how nice it looks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe went and admired it to please her.\n\nOn a sudden, when he had sat down again, she came softly up behind his\narm-chair, and putting her right arm round his neck she kissed him,\nwhile she laid on the chimney-shelf a small packet wrapped in white\npaper which she held in the other hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. Then, as she made no reply, he understood,\nrecognising the shape of the frame.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive it me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nShe pretended not to hear him, and went back to the linen cupboards. He\ngot up hastily, took the melancholy relic, and going across the room,\nput it in the drawer of his writing-table, which he locked and double\nlocked. She wiped away a tear with the tip of her finger, and said in a\nrather quavering voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I am going to see whether your new\nservant keeps the kitchen in good order. As she is out I can look into\neverything and make sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nLetters of recommendation from Professors Mas-Roussel, Remusot, Flache,\nand Borriquel, written in the most flattering terms with regard to Dr.\nPierre Roland, their pupil, had been submitted by M. Marchand to the\ndirectors of the Transatlantic Shipping Co., seconded by M. Poulin,\njudge of the Chamber of Commerce, M. Lenient, a great ship-owner, and\nMr. Marival, deputy to the Mayor of Havre, and a particular friend of\nCaptain Beausires's. It proved that no medical officer had yet been\nappointed to the Lorraine, and Pierre was lucky enough to be nominated\nwithin a few days.\n\nThe letter announcing it was handed to him one morning by Josephine,\njust as he was dressed. His first feeling was that of a man condemned\nto death who is told that his sentence is commuted; he had an immediate\nsense of relief at the thought of his early departure and of the\npeaceful life on board, cradled by the rolling waves, always wandering,\nalways moving. His life under his father's roof was now that of a\nstranger, silent and reserved. Ever since the evening when he allowed\nthe shameful secret he had discovered to escape him in his brother's\npresence, he had felt that the last ties to his kindred were broken. He\nwas harassed by remorse for having told this thing to Jean. He felt that\nit was odious, indecent, and brutal, and yet it was a relief to him to\nhave uttered it.\n\nHe never met the eyes either of his mother or his brother; to avoid his\ngaze theirs had become surprisingly alert, with the cunning of foes who\nfear to cross each other. He was always wondering: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can she have\nsaid to Jean? Did she confess or deny it? What does my brother believe?\nWhat does he think of her--what does he think of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He could not\nguess, and it drove him to frenzy. And he scarcely ever spoke to them,\nexcepting when Roland was by, to avoid his questioning.\n\nAs soon as he received the letter announcing his appointment he showed\nit at once to his family. His father, who was prone to rejoicing over\neverything, clapped his hands. Jean spoke seriously, though his heart\nwas full of gladness: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI congratulate you with all my heart, for I\nknow there were several other candidates. You certainly owe it to your\nprofessors' letters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis mother bent her head and murmured:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very glad you have been successful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter breakfast he went to the Company's offices to obtain information\non various particulars, and he asked the name of the doctor on board\nthe Picardie, which was to sail next day, to inquire of him as to the\ndetails of his new life and any details he might think useful.\n\nDr. Pirette having gone on board, Pierre went to the ship, where he was\nreceived in a little state-room by a young man with a fair beard, not\nunlike his brother. They talked together a long time.\n\nIn the hollow depths of the huge ship they could hear a confused and\ncontinuous commotion; the noise of bales and cases pitched down into\nthe hold mingling with footsteps, voices, the creaking of the machinery\nlowering the freight, the boatswain's whistle, and the clatter of chains\ndragged or wound on to capstans by the snorting and panting engine which\nsent a slight vibration from end to end of the great vessel.\n\nBut when Pierre had left his colleague and found himself in the street\nonce more, a new form of melancholy came down on him, enveloping him\nlike the fogs which roll over the sea, coming up from the ends of the\nworld and holding in their intangible density something mysteriously\nimpure, as it were the pestilential breath of a far-away, unhealthy\nland.\n\nIn his hours of greatest suffering he had never felt himself so sunk\nin a foul pit of misery. It was as though he had given the last wrench;\nthere was no fibre of attachment left. In tearing up the roots of every\naffection he had not hitherto had the distressful feeling which now came\nover him, like that of a lost dog. It was no longer a torturing mortal\npain, but the frenzy of a forlorn and homeless animal, the physical\nanguish of a vagabond creature without a roof for shelter, lashed by the\nrain, the wind, the storm, all the brutal forces of the universe. As he\nset foot on the vessel, as he went into the cabin rocked by the waves,\nthe very flesh of the man, who had always slept in a motionless and\nsteady bed, had risen up against the insecurity henceforth of all his\nmorrows. Till now that flesh had been protected by a solid wall built\ninto the earth which held it, by the certainty of resting in the same\nspot, under a roof which could resist the gale. Now all that, which it\nwas a pleasure to defy in the warmth of home, must become a peril and\na constant discomfort. No earth under foot, only the greedy, heaving,\ncomplaining sea; no space around for walking, running, losing the way,\nonly a few yards of planks to pace like a convict among other prisoners;\nno trees, no gardens, no streets, no houses; nothing but water and\nclouds. And the ceaseless motion of the ship beneath his feet. On stormy\ndays he must lean against the wainscot, hold on to the doors, cling to\nthe edge of the narrow berth to save himself from rolling out. On calm\ndays he would hear the snorting throb of the screw, and feel the\nswift flight of the ship, bearing him on in its unpausing, regular,\nexasperating race.\n\nAnd he was condemned to this vagabond convict's life solely because his\nmother had yielded to a man's caresses.\n\nHe walked on, his heart sinking with the despairing sorrow of those who\nare doomed to exile. He no longer felt a haughty disdain and scornful\nhatred of the strangers he met, but a woeful impulse to speak to them,\nto tell them all that he had to quit France, to be listened to and\ncomforted. There was in the very depths of his heart the shame-faced\nneed of a beggar who would fain hold out his hand--a timid but urgent\nneed to feel that some one would grieve at his departing.\n\nHe thought of Marowsko. The old Pole was the only person who loved\nhim well enough to feel true and keen emotion, and the doctor at once\ndetermined to go and see him.\n\nWhen he entered the shop, the druggist, who was pounding powders in a\nmarble mortar, started and left his work.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are never to be seen nowadays,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\nPierre explained that he had had a great many serious matters to attend\nto, but without giving the reason, and he took a seat, asking:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and how is business doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBusiness was not doing at all. Competition was fearful, and rich folks\nrare in that workmen's quarter. Nothing would sell but cheap drugs, and\nthe doctors did not prescribe the costlier and more complicated remedies\non which a profit is made of five hundred per cent. The old fellow ended\nby saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf this goes on for three months I shall shut up shop. If I\ndid not count on you, dear good doctor, I should have turned shoe-black\nby this time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre felt a pang, and made up his mind to deal the blow at once, since\nit must be done.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--oh, I cannot be of any use to you. I am leaving Havre early next\nmonth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarowsko took off his spectacles, so great was his agitation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou! You! What are you saying?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say that I am going away, my poor friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man was stricken, feeling his last hope slipping from under him,\nand he suddenly turned against this man, whom he had followed, whom he\nloved, whom he had so implicitly trusted, and who forsook him thus.\n\nHe stammered out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are surely not going to play me false--you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre was so deeply touched that he felt inclined to embrace the old\nfellow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not playing you false. I have not found anything to do here, and I\nam going as medical officer on board a Transatlantic passenger boat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO Monsieur Pierre! And you always promised you would help me to make a\nliving!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can I do? I must make my own living. I have not a farthing in the\nworld.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarowsko said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is wrong; what you are doing is very wrong. There is\nnothing for me but to die of hunger. At my age this is the end of all\nthings. It is wrong. You are forsaking a poor old man who came here to\nbe with you. It is wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre tried to explain, to protest, to give reasons, to prove that he\ncould not have done otherwise; the Pole, enraged by his desertion, would\nnot listen to him, and he ended by saying, with an allusion no doubt to\npolitical events:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou French--you never keep your word!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this Pierre rose, offended on his part, and taking rather a high tone\nhe said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are unjust, pere Marowsko; a man must have very strong motives to\nact as I have done and you ought to understand that. Au revoir--I hope I\nmay find you more reasonable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he went away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot a soul will feel a sincere regret for\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis mind sought through all the people he knew or had known, and among\nthe faces which crossed his memory he saw that of the girl at the tavern\nwho had led him to doubt his mother.\n\nHe hesitated, having still an instinctive grudge against her, then\nsuddenly reflected on the other hand: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter all, she was right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he\nlooked about him to find the turning.\n\nThe beer-shop, as it happened, was full of people, and also full of\nsmoke. The customers, tradesmen, and labourers, for it was a holiday,\nwere shouting, calling, laughing, and the master himself was waiting\non them, running from table to table, carrying away empty glasses and\nreturning them crowned with froth.\n\nWhen Pierre had found a seat not far from the desk he waited, hoping\nthat the girl would see him and recognise him. But she passed him again\nand again as she went to and fro, pattering her feet under her skirts\nwith a smart little strut. At last he rapped a coin on the table, and\nshe hurried up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat will you take, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not look at him; her mind was absorbed in calculations of the\nliquor she had served.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is a pretty way of greeting a friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe fixed her eyes on his face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she hurriedly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it you?\nYou are pretty well? But I have not a minute to-day. A bock did you wish\nfor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, a bock!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen she brought it he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have come to say good-bye. I am going away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she replied indifferently:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed. Where are you going?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo America.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA very fine country, they say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd that was all!\n\nReally, he was very ill-advised to address her on such a busy day; there\nwere too many people in the cafe.\n\nPierre went down to the sea. As he reached the jetty he descried the\nPearl; his father and Beausire were coming in. Papagris was pulling,\nand the two men, seated in the stern, smoked their pipes with a look\nof perfect happiness. As they went past the doctor said to himself:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlessed are the simple-minded!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he sat down on one of the benches\non the breakwater, to try to lull himself in animal drowsiness.\n\nWhen he went home in the evening his mother said, without daring to lift\nher eyes to his face:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will want a heap of things to take with you. I have ordered your\nunder-linen, and I went into the tailor's shop about cloth clothes; but\nis there nothing else you need--things which I, perhaps, know nothing\nabout?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis lips parted to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he reflected that he must\naccept the means of getting a decent outfit, and he replied in a very\ncalm voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hardly know myself, yet. I will make inquiries at the\noffice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe inquired, and they gave him a list of indispensable necessaries. His\nmother, as she took it from his hand, looked up at him for the first\ntime for very long, and in the depths of her eyes there was the humble\nexpression, gentle, sad, and beseeching, of a dog that has been beaten\nand begs forgiveness.\n\nOn the 1st of October the Lorraine from Saint-Nazaire, came into the\nharbour of Havre to sail on the 7th, bound for New York, and Pierre\nRoland was to take possession of the little floating cabin in which\nhenceforth his life was to be confined.\n\nNext day as he was going out, he met his mother on the stairs waiting\nfor him, to murmur in an almost inaudible voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would not like me to help you to put things to rights on board?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, thank you. Everything is done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should have liked to see your cabin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing to see. It is very small and very ugly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he went downstairs, leaving her stricken, leaning against the wall\nwith a wan face.\n\nNow Roland, who had gone over the Lorraine that very day, could talk of\nnothing all dinnertime but this splendid vessel, and wondered that his\nwife should not care to see it as their son was to sail on board.\n\nPierre had scarcely any intercourse with his family during the days\nwhich followed. He was nervous, irritable, hard, and his rough speech\nseemed to lash every one indiscriminately. But the day before he left\nhe was suddenly quite changed, and much softened. As he embraced his\nparents before going to sleep on board for the first time he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will come to say good-bye to me on board, will you not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, yes, of course--of course, Louise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly, certainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a low voice.\n\nPierre went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe sail at eleven precisely. You must be there by\nhalf-past nine at the latest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried his father. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA good idea! As soon as we have bid you\ngood-bye, we will make haste on board the Pearl, and look out for you\nbeyond the jetty, so as to see you once more. What do you say, Louise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd in that way you will not lose sight of us among\nthe crowd which throngs the breakwater when the great liners sail. It\nis impossible to distinguish your own friends in the mob. Does that meet\nyour views?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, to be sure; that is settled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAn hour later he was lying in his berth--a little crib as long and\nnarrow as a coffin. There he remained with his eyes wide open for a long\ntime, thinking over all that had happened during the last two months of\nhis life, especially in his own soul. By dint of suffering and making\nothers suffer, his aggressive and revengeful anguish had lost its edge,\nlike a blunted sword. He scarcely had the heart left in him to owe any\none or anything a grudge; he let his rebellious wrath float away\ndown stream, as his life must. He was so weary of wrestling, weary of\nfighting, weary of hating, weary of everything, that he was quite worn\nout, and tried to stupefy his heart with forgetfulness as he dropped\nasleep. He heard vaguely, all about him, the unwonted noises of the\nship, slight noises, and scarcely audible on this calm night in port;\nand he felt no more of the dreadful wound which had tortured him\nhitherto, but the discomfort and strain of its healing.\n\nHe had been sleeping soundly when the stir of the crew roused him.\nIt was day; the tidal train had come down to the pier bringing the\npassengers from Paris. Then he wandered about the vessel among all\nthese busy, bustling folks inquiring for their cabins, questioning\nand answering each other at random, in the scare and fuss of a voyage\nalready begun. After greeting the Captain and shaking hands with his\ncomrade the purser, he went into the saloon where some Englishmen were\nalready asleep in the corners. The large low room, with its white marble\npanels framed in gilt beading, was furnished with looking-glasses,\nwhich prolonged, in endless perspective, the long tables, flanked by\npivot-seats covered with red velvet. It was fit, indeed, to be the\nvast floating cosmopolitan dining-hall, where the rich natives of two\ncontinents might eat in common. Its magnificent luxury was that of great\nhotels, and theatres, and public rooms; the imposing and commonplace\nluxury which appeals to the eye of the millionaire.\n\nThe doctor was on the point of turning into the second-class saloon,\nwhen he remembered that a large cargo of emigrants had come on board\nthe night before, and he went down to the lower deck. He was met by a\nsickening smell of dirty, poverty-stricken humanity, an atmosphere of\nnaked flesh (far more revolting than the odour of fur or the skin of\nwild beasts). There, in a sort of basement, low and dark, like a\ngallery in a mine, Pierre could discern some hundreds of men, women, and\nchildren, stretched on shelves fixed one above another, or lying on the\nfloor in heaps. He could not see their faces, but could dimly make out\nthis squalid, ragged crowd of wretches, beaten in the struggle for\nlife, worn out and crushed, setting forth, each with a starving wife and\nweakly children, for an unknown land where they hoped, perhaps, not to\ndie of hunger. And as he thought of their past labour--wasted labour,\nand barren effort--of the mortal struggle taken up afresh and in vain\neach day, of the energy expended by this tattered crew who were going to\nbegin again, not knowing where, this life of hideous misery, he longed\nto cry out to them:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTumble yourselves overboard, rather, with your women and your little\nones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And his heart ached so with pity that he went away unable to\nendure the sight.\n\nHe found his father, his mother, Jean, and Mme. Rosemilly waiting for\nhim in his cabin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo early!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mme. Roland in a trembling voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe wanted to have a\nlittle time to see you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at her. She was dressed all in black as if she were in\nmourning, and he noticed that her hair, which only a month ago had been\ngray, was now almost white. It was very difficult to find space for four\npersons to sit down in the little room, and he himself got on to his\nbed. The door was left open, and they could see a great crowd hurrying\nby, as if it were a street on a holiday, for all the friends of the\npassengers and a host of inquisitive visitors had invaded the huge\nvessel. They pervaded the passages, the saloons, every corner of the\nship; and heads peered in at the doorway while a voice murmured outside:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the doctor's cabin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Pierre shut the door; but no sooner was he shut in with his own\nparty than he longed to open it again, for the bustle outside covered\ntheir agitation and want of words.\n\nMme. Rosemilly at last felt she must speak.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery little air comes in through those little windows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPort-holes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pierre. He showed her how thick the glass was,\nto enable it to resist the most violent shocks, and took a long time\nexplaining the fastening. Roland presently asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you have your\ndoctor's shop here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor opened a cupboard and displayed an array of phials ticketed\nwith Latin names on white paper labels. He took one out and enumerated\nthe properties of its contents; then a second and a third, a perfect\nlecture on therapeutics, to which they all listened with great\nattention. Roland, shaking his head, said again and again: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow very\ninteresting!\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was a tap at the door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pierre, and Captain Beausire appeared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am late,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said as he shook hands, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not want to be in the\nway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He, too, sat down on the bed and silence fell once more.\n\nSuddenly the Captain pricked his ears. He could hear the orders being\ngiven, and he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is time for us to be off if we mean to get on board the Pearl to see\nyou once more outside, and bid you good-bye out on the open sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Roland was very eager about this, to impress the voyagers on board\nthe Lorraine, no doubt, and he rose in haste.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye, my boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He kissed Pierre on the whiskers and then opened the\ndoor.\n\nMme. Roland had not stirred, but sat with downcast eyes, very pale. Her\nhusband touched her arm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe must make haste, we have not a minute to spare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe pulled herself up, went to her son and offered him first one and\nthen another cheek of white wax which he kissed without saying a word.\nThen he shook hands with Mme. Rosemilly and his brother, asking:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when is the wedding to be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know yet exactly. We will make it fit in with one of your\nreturn voyages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt last they were all out of the cabin, and up on deck among the crowd\nof visitors, porters, and sailors. The steam was snorting in the huge\nbelly of the vessel, which seemed to quiver with impatience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roland in a great bustle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Pierre, standing on one of the landing-planks lying\nbetween the deck of the Lorraine and the quay. He shook hands all round\nonce more, and they were gone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMake haste, jump into the carriage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the father.\n\nA fly was waiting for them and took them to the outer harbour, where\nPapagris had the Pearl in readiness to put out to sea.\n\nThere was not a breath of air; it was one of those crisp, still autumn\ndays, when the sheeny sea looks as cold and hard as polished steel.\n\nJean took one oar, the sailor seized the other and they pulled off.\nOn the breakwater, on the piers, even on the granite parapets, a crowd\nstood packed, hustling, and noisy, to see the Lorraine come out. The\nPearl glided down between these two waves of humanity and was soon\noutside the mole.\n\nCaptain Beausire, seated between the two women, held the tiller, and he\nsaid:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will see, we shall be close in her way--close.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the two oarsmen pulled with all their might to get out as far as\npossible. Suddenly Roland cried out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere she comes! I see her masts and her two funnels! She is coming out\nof the inner harbour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCheerily, lads!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Beausire.\n\nMme. Roland took out her handkerchief and held it to her eyes.\n\nRoland stood up, clinging to the mast, and answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt this moment she is working round in the outer harbour. She is\nstanding still--now she moves again! She is taking the tow-rope on board\nno doubt. There she goes. Bravo! She is between the piers! Do you hear\nthe crowd shouting? Bravo! The Neptune has her in tow. Now I see her\nbows--here she comes--here she is! Gracious Heavens, what a ship! Look!\nLook!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMme. Rosemilly and Beausire looked behind them, the oarsmen ceased\npulling; only Mme. Roland did not stir.\n\nThe immense steamship, towed by a powerful tug, which, in front of\nher, looked like a caterpillar, came slowly and majestically out of the\nharbour. And the good people of Havre, who crowded the piers, the beach,\nand the windows, carried away by a burst of patriotic enthusiasm,\ncried: \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Vive la Lorraine!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d with acclamations and applause for this\nmagnificent beginning, this birth of the beautiful daughter given to the\nsea by the great maritime town.\n\nShe, as soon as she had passed beyond the narrow channel between the two\ngranite walls, feeling herself free at last, cast off the tow-ropes and\nwent off alone, like a monstrous creature walking on the waters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere she is--here she comes, straight down on us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Roland kept\nshouting; and Beausire, beaming, exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did I promise you!\nHeh! Do I know the way?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean in a low tone said to his mother: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, mother, she is close upon\nus!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Mme. Roland uncovered her eyes, blinded with tears.\n\nThe Lorraine came on, still under the impetus of her swift exit from the\nharbour, in the brilliant, calm weather. Beausire, with his glass to his\neye, called out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook out! M. Pierre is at the stern, all alone, plainly to be seen!\nLook out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe ship was almost touching the Pearl now, as tall as a mountain and\nas swift as a train. Mme. Roland, distraught and desperate, held out her\narms towards it; and she saw her son, her Pierre, with his officer's cap\non, throwing kisses to her with both hands.\n\nBut he was going away, flying, vanishing, a tiny speck already, no more\nthan an imperceptible spot on the enormous vessel. She tried still to\ndistinguish him, but she could not.\n\nJean took her hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou saw?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I saw. How good he is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd they turned to go home.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCristi! How fast she goes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Roland with enthusiastic\nconviction.\n\nThe steamer, in fact, was shrinking every second, as though she were\nmelting away in the ocean. Mme. Roland, turning back to look at her,\nwatched her disappearing on the horizon, on her way to an unknown land\nat the other side of the world.\n\nIn that vessel which nothing could stay, that vessel which she soon\nwould see no more, was her son, her poor son. And she felt as though\nhalf her heart had gone with him; she felt, too, as if her life were\nended; yes, and she felt as though she would never see the child again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy are you crying?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked her husband, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen you know he will be back\nagain within a month.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe stammered out: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know; I cry because I am hurt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen they had landed, Beausire at once took leave of them to go to\nbreakfast with a friend. Then Jean led the way with Mme. Rosemilly, and\nRoland said to his wife:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA very fine fellow, all the same, is our Jean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the mother.\n\nAnd her mind being too much bewildered to think of what she was saying,\nshe went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very glad that he is to marry Mme. Rosemilly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe worthy man was astounded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeh? What? He is to marry Mme. Rosemilly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, we meant to ask your opinion about it this very day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBless me! And has this engagement been long in the wind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no, only a very few days. Jean wished to make sure that she would\naccept him before consulting you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoland rubbed his hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery good. Very good. It is capital. I entirely approve.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs they were about to turn off from the quay down the Boulevard\nFrancois, his wife once more looked back to cast a last look at the high\nseas, but she could see nothing now but a puff of gray smoke, so far\naway, so faint that it looked like a film of haze.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pierre and Jean, by Guy de Maupassant\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PIERRE AND JEAN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3804-0.txt or 3804-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/8\/0\/3804\/\n\nProduced by Dagny; John Bickers; David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1426,"split":"test"}
