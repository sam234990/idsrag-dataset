As the two are driving home from a trip to town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into a river. After they return home, she and Adam notice that they now lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased. They then begin to suspect that they did not survive the car accident; Adam attempts to leave the house but finds himself in a strange, otherworldly landscape covered in sand and populated by enormous sandworms.\nThe house is sold and the new owners, the Deetz family, arrive from New York City. Charles Deetz is a former real estate developer; his second wife Delia is a self-proclaimed sculptor; and his goth daughter Lydia, from his first marriage, is an aspiring photographer. Under the guidance of interior designer Otho, the Deetzes transform the house into tasteless pastel-toned modern art. Consulting the Handbook, the Maitlands travel to an otherworldly waiting room populated by other distressed souls, where they discover that the afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and caseworkers. The Maitlands' own caseworker, Juno, informs them that they must remain in the house for 125 years. If they want the Deetzes out of the house, it is up to them to scare them away. Barbara's and Adam's attempts at scaring the family prove ineffective.\nAlthough Adam and Barbara remain invisible to Charles and Delia, teenage Lydia can see the ghost couple and befriends them. Against Juno's advice, the Maitlands contact the miscreant Beetlejuice, Juno's former assistant and now freelance \"bio-exorcist\" ghost, to scare away the Deetzes. However, Beetlejuice quickly offends the Maitlands with his crude and morbid demeanor; and they reconsider hiring him, though too late to stop him from wreaking havoc on the Deetzes. The small town's charm and the supernatural events inspire Charles to pitch his boss Maxie Dean on transforming the town into a tourist hot spot, but Maxie wants proof of the ghosts. Using the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, Otho conducts what he thinks is a s\u0102\u0160ance and summons Adam and Barbara, but they begin to decay and die, as Otho had unwittingly performed an exorcism instead. Horrified, Lydia summons Beetlejuice for help; but he agrees to help her only on the condition that she marry him, enabling him to freely cause chaos in the mortal world. Beetlejuice saves the Maitlands and disposes of Maxie, his wife, and Otho, then prepares a wedding before a ghastly minister. The Maitlands intervene before the ceremony is completed, with Barbara riding a sandworm through the house to devour Beetlejuice.\nFinally, the Deetzes and Maitlands agree to live in harmony within the house. Beetlejuice , meanwhile, is stuck in the after-life waiting room; there he antagonizes a witch doctor, who shrinks his head. Being Beetlejuice, however, he remains upbeat: \"This could be a good look for me.\"\n<html>\n\n<head>\n   <title>\"Beetlejuice,\" shooting script, by Michael McDowell; and Warren Skaaren<\/title>\n<\/head>\n\n<body>\n   <pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              BEETLE JUICE\n\n\n\n\n                         SECOND DRAFT SCREENPLAY\n                             REVISED 2-3-87\n\n\n\n                           BY WARREN SKAAREN\n\n                       FROM AN ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n                                   BY\n                            MICHAEL MCDOWELL\n\n\n\n                           based on a story by\n\n                    Michael McDowell and Larry Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        FADE IN:\n\n        EXT. WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT - DAY\n\n        A crisp and perfect New England town.  Almost too neat\n        to be real.  No visible townspeople.  CAMERA EXPLORES\n        town.\n\n\n        CAMERA FLIES\n\n        over a rickety bridge -- PAST the Maitland Hardware and\n        Appliance store -- PAST the church -- the Historical\n        Society -- UP over the graveyard on the hill and\n        finally --\n\n        To the Maitland house.  The perfect Victorian house\n        surveying the tiny village.  Suddenly --\n\n\n        A GIANT DADDY LONGLEGS SPIDER\n\n        mounts the crest of the hill beside the house, pauses to\n        wave a spindly leg and then creeps menacingly on top of\n        the Maitland house.\n\n                                ADAM (O.S..)\n                  Well, well, you're a big fella...!\n\n        A hand -- as big as God's -- with a huge tweezer,\n        gently reaches down out of the sky and lies, palm up,\n        in the yard next to the house.  Daddy Longlegs climbs\n        into it.  The hand rises into the sky again.\n\n\n        INT. ATTIC - NEW ANGLE - DAY\n\n        Reveals Winter River as a miniature town, while The\n        Daddy Longlegs and the hand are normal size.  Above the\n        model are a homely representation of moon, sun, and\n        stars -- a whole, tiny, mechanical universe to track\n        the hours of the day.  A large plat map of the city is\n        prominent on the wall.\n\n        The hand is ADAM MAITLAND'S.  In his late 30's, he's a\n        solid easy-going citizen.  Capra used to make movies\n        about him.\n\n        Adam's model town sprawls across most of the attic\n        space.  Windows on either end of the attic shed good\n        light into the warm room.  Adam very carefully lifts\n        the spider out the open window.  Smiles as he drips him\n        lightly on the breeze.\n\n\n        CAMERA TILTS UP FROM THE WINDOW\n\n        To see the real Winter River, laid out exactly as the\n        model, at the foot of the hill.

THE GREAT VOID\n\n        Adam is nowhere.  There's no ground, no sky, nothing to\n        stand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance.\n        Just vast nothing.  Not white and not colored either.\n        NOISE OF A CLOCK TICKING.\n\n        Adam looks about surprised, doesn't like what he\n        doesn't see.  He turns around to head back up the\n        steps.  There are no steps.\n\n                                ADAM\n                  Barbara?\n\n        His VOICE ECHOES STRANGELY.

Something pours up\n        out of the tear -- ooze or stuffing.\n\n        Adam runs forward and stares after the wheel, which is\n        now out of sight.\n\n\n        TWO SMALLER GEARS\n\n        looking very much like components of a giant watch --\n        spin along behind him.  One of them veers suddenly\n        toward him, and though Adam jumps out of the way, the\n        gear snags his trouser leg and shreds it.  LOUD\n        TICKING.\n\n\n        A PERFECTLY ENORMOUS GEAR\n\n        comes barreling toward him.  Adam leaps out of its\n        way.  The gear turns, fish-tailing, kicking up ooze and\n        stuffing.\n\n        Adam flings himself suddenly to the right, but trips\n        into the path of the gear.  As he's about to be\n        crushed, he's suddenly jerked up to safety.\n\n\n        EXT.

CAMERA EXPLORES the room a\n        bit.  It is getting slightly tatty.  Adam rolls over,\n        pulling the covers off Barbara.  We see:\n\n        ON BARBARA -- she is hovering off the side of the bed.\n\n        An OMINOUS RUMBLE -- like a 4.0 earthquake shakes\n        the house.  GLASS RATTLES, the ceramic horses on the\n        mantelpiece jump around.  Barbara falls to the floor.\n        They look at one another with horror.  They leap up and\n        run downstairs.\n\n\n        INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n        The RUMBLE BUILDS TO A CLIMAX, there is a LOUD METALLIC\n        SQUEAL, and then a CRASH... just as Barbara and Adam\n        arrive.\n\n\n        THE FRONT DOOR\n\n        smashes open revealing a moving van ramp.\n\n\n        A TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC-BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH\n\n        slides smoothly down the ramp.  On the couch sits DELIA\n        DEETZ.\n\n        The couch CRASHES into the base of the staircase,\n        smashing the newel post and several of the balusters.\n        Barbara cringes.  One of the balusters falls at Delia's\n        side.  She grasps it like a scepter.\n\n        Two MOVING MEN rush down the ramp.\n\n                                MOVING MAN #1\n                  Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.\n\n                                DELIA\n                  Don't worry.  It was going anyway.\n\n        Delia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion-\n        able, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured.\n\n        She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara\n        and Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale\n        image.\n\n        Delia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks \n        through Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there\n        (which to her eyes they're not).\n\n        Still holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch\n        and moves into the living room, surveying it with an\n        odd mixture of ambition, and resolution.\n\n\n        BEHIND HER\n\n        the two Moving Men bring in a matching blue leather\n        armchair.  In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ.\n\n        Lydia, age 14, is a pretty girl, but wan, pale and\n        overly-dramatic, dressed as she is in her favorite\n        color, black.  She's a combination of a little death\n        rocker and an 80's version of Edward Gorey's little\n        girls.\n\n        She has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck\n        -- and is already taking photographs of the moving\n        men.  Lydia is cool, Lydia is sullen, Lydia is her\n        father's daughter by his first marriage.  Lydia is\n        usually about half-pissed off.  But underneath... we\n        like her a lot.\n\n        The Moving Men still hold up the chair, waiting for\n        Delia to decide where she wants it.\n\n                                DELIA\n                         (continuing)\n                  Jesus.

SURFACE OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN - DAY\n\n        Barbara plunges into the dusty surface of Titan with an\n        enormous Saturn looming in the sky.  She looks around\n        with wonder and some fear.\n\n\n        A SULFUR VOLCANO\n\n        erupts in the distance.  A meteor CRASHES with a lurid\n        EXPLOSION.  As from a great distance she hears Adam's\n        VOICE.  Like THUNDER.\n\n                                ADAM\n                  Barbara!\n\n        She turns slowly in the yellow dense sand that covers\n        the surface of this distant moon.\n\n\n        BARBARA'S POV\n\n        Adam is trudging towards her.  Behind him, hovering\n        isolated in the air, is the kitchen door.\n\n\n        BACK TO SCENE\n\n        Adam at last catches up with her.  Surveys around them.\n\n                                BARBARA\n                  Oh Adam.  <u>Find<\/u> somebody.  I'm\n                  getting all yellow.  <u>Do<\/u> something!\n\n\n        BEHIND THEM\n\n        Something is burrowing rapidly toward them through the\n        sand.  The Something could be right out of \"Dune\".\n\n\n        BARBARA AND ADAM\n\n        stare for a moment, then Adam grabs her and pulls her\n        toward the kitchen door.  But the kitchen door has\n        moved, so they veer in the new direction.\n\n        The Something follows them and <u>rises out of the sand<\/u>.\n\n\n        ON SOMETHING\n\n        It is a very big, very nasty, and very hungry SNAPPING\n        SANDWORM.  It ROARS and lunges at them.\n\n\n        BARBARA\n\n        slightly angered at it, instinctively bats at it.\n\n\n        THE SANDWORM\n\n        is momentarily stunned at Barbara's audacity.  It\n        freezes and shakes its loathesome head.\n\n\n        BARBARA\n\n        bats at it again.  Adam is wide-eyed, tries to pull her\n        away.  The Sandworm recovers and ROARS after them.\n\n\n        ADAM\n\n        grabs Barbara and tries to escape, but they slip and\n        sink in the sand.\n\n        They make it to the door just in time, swing it open\n        and hurl themselves through.  The door shuts with a\n        BANG just in front of the ROARING SANDWORM.\n\n        THE SANDWORM\n\n        rears and ROARS in frustration, HOWLING to the ringed\n        planet.\n\n\n        INT. KITCHEN\n\n        Barbara, weeping, throws herself in Adam's arms.\n\n                                BARBARA\n                  Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me\n                  alone.\n\n                                ADAM\n                  <u>You<\/u> left me.\n\n                                BARBARA\n                  I know.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY\n\n        Lydia looks up the stairs at the attic landing.  She's\n        a little scared.  She decides to go up the dark stairs.\n\n        IN THE HALL\n\n        At the end of the hall stands Charles, directing men\n        who are carrying books into the room that will be his\n        study.\n\n        He continues on.\n\n\n        A BLAST of STEAM\n\n        fills the hallway, because workmen are already going at\n        the wallpaper.  Lydia emerges from it.  Looking up at\n        stairway to attic, mounting courage.\n\n\n        INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - DAY\n\n        Lydia creeps upward, taking the skeleton key from her\n        pocket.  FLOORBOARDS SQUEAK.\n\n\n        INT. ATTIC - DAY\n\n        Adam works on his model.

I've locked it.\n\n        Barbara smiles and knits while rocking in her chair.\n\n\n        INT. ATTIC LANDING\n\n        Lydia quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic\n        door.  She turns it.  The key is stiff.  She turns\n        harder.  It's stuck.  Lydia tries the door -- it's no\n        go.  She turns the key again.  This time it goes all\n        the way around.\n\n\n        INT. ATTIC - DAY\n\n        Barbara and Adam, surprised by the key, look at each\n        other, carefully, very quietly, stand up and tiptoe\n        toward door.\n\n\n        ON THE SCREEN OF AN OLD TV SET\n\n        in the corner of the attic -- <u>Suddenly<\/u> -- a ghostly\n        image POPS ON.\n\n\n        ON TV - A BIZARRE, SMALLISH FELLOW\n\n        outfitted in a too-big cowboy hat, bad wig, and over-\n        sized sunglasses appears on screen <u>singing<\/u> very\n        quickly.

It's stuck.\n\n        Then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on\n        the floor.\n\n        Charles' head suddenly appears behind her.

He sits uneasily in an easy chair, tries\n        like hell to get comfortable.  Finally, he puts a book\n        under his bottom to get sitting straight.  Looks around\n        tapping his fingers.  What to do?  Looks at watch.\n\n        He takes down a book from Adam's library, it is an\n        Audubon book of birds.  He whips through it like it's\n        the comics and then looks around for more.\n\n        He finds the \"Illustrated Walden\" by Thoreau.  He\n        speed reads it.\n\n        He is now really bored.  Goes to the fireplace, tries\n        to light it.  Cannot do it.

Delia pours for\n        Bernard, the obvious connoisseur.  He tastes the wine.\n        All wait.  Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.

And then our Delia Deetz,\n        unable to help herself, leaves the whitebread world\n        behind and possessed, sings in someone else's voice, a\n        rich, NEGRO TENOR.\n\n                                DELIA\n                  \"If I didn't care, More than\n                  words could say.\"\n\n        Lydia's eyes widen.

They\n        stand by their chairs, they spin in perfect Motown\n        choreography.\n\n                                EVERYONE\n                         (except Lydia)\n                  \"Shoo doo wop.

She is in\n        teen heaven.\n\n        NOTE:  Delia and the guests are fully aware of their\n        singing\/actions, but helpless to stop themselves.  While\n        it is funny, it is nevertheless just a little frighten-\n        ing.\n\n        Lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can\n        see the ghosts.  She can't.\n\n        Now the song pauses... Everyone tries to recover for a\n        shocked second.  Instead, the tempo changes.\n\n        As the tempo quickens, the guest\/chorus is syncopated\n        like alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled\n        into their chairs.  They sing throughout.\n\n\n        THE SONG\n\n        crashes to its end.  Bernard looks down at his shrimp\n        cocktail.  The shrimp draped over the rice roll\n        suddenly rears up like a hand and, making a tiny fist,\n        grabs his dangling tie and... <u>smash<\/u> --\n\n        WIDER -- All the guests are punched by the shrimp, back\n        over their chairs to the ground.  They are stunned. \n        Suddenly everyone runs frightened into the next room.\n\n\n        EXT.\/INT.
