{"ori_id":"485b86c3ffec91e89fbc846985944adc0cf73c80","title":"Cousin Henry","context":"Cousin Henry\n Indefer Jones is the aged squire, between seventy and eighty years of age, of a large manor, Llanfeare, in Carmarthen, Wales. His niece, Isabel Brodrick, has lived with him for years after the remarriage of her father, and endeared herself to everyone. However, according to his strong traditional beliefs, the estate should be bequeathed to a male heir.\nHis sole male blood relative is his nephew Henry Jones, a London clerk. Henry has, in the past, incurred debts that the squire had paid off, been \"sent away from Oxford\", and generally made a poor impression on his occasional visits to Llanfeare. Nevertheless, Henry is told of his uncle's intention to make him the heir to the estate and is invited to pay a visit. Isabel rejects her uncle's suggestion that she solve his dilemma by marrying Henry, as she cannot stand her cousin. Indefer Jones finds his nephew to be just as detestable as ever. As a result, he overcomes his prejudice and changes his will one final time, in Isabel's favour. Unfortunately, he dies before he can tell anyone.\nFinding the document hidden in a book of sermons by accident, Henry vacillates between keeping silent and revealing its location. He is neither good enough to give up the estate nor evil enough to burn the document, fearing disgrace, a long jail sentence and, not least, eternal damnation. Instead, he comforts himself by reasoning that doing nothing cannot be a crime.\nIndefer Jones had had his last will witnessed by two of his tenants, but since the will cannot be found despite a thorough search of the house, Henry inherits the estate. However, already extant suspicions are only strengthened by his guilty manner. He endures abuse from everyone; his own servants either quit or treat him with disrespect. He takes to spending hours in the library, where the will is hidden.\nThe local newspaper begins to publish accounts of the affair that are insulting and seemingly libelous to Henry. It accuses him of destroying the will and usurping the estate from Isabel, whom everybody knows and respects. The old squire's lawyer, Mr Apjohn, himself suspecting that Henry knows more than he lets on, approaches the new squire about the articles, pressuring the unwilling young man into taking legal action against the editor. Henry finds that this only makes things worse. The prospect of being cross examined in the witness box fills him with dread. He realises the truth would be dragged out of him in court.\nMr Apjohn, by clever questioning, gets a good idea about where the will is. Henry knows that time is running out, but once again procrastinates. Mr Apjohn and Mr Brodrick, Isabel's father, visit Henry at home and find the document, despite Henry's ineffectual efforts to stop them. Because he did not destroy the will, Henry is permitted to return to his job in London with his reputation intact and \u00c2\u01414000, the amount Isabel was bequeathed in the other will.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Cousin Henry, by Anthony Trollope\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Conclusion\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nUncle Indefer\n\n\n\"I have a conscience, my dear, on this matter,\" said an old gentleman\nto a young lady, as the two were sitting in the breakfast parlour of\na country house which looked down from the cliffs over the sea on the\ncoast of Carmarthenshire.\n\n\"And so have I, Uncle Indefer; and as my conscience is backed by my\ninclination, whereas yours is not--\"\n\n\"You think that I shall give way?\"\n\n\"I did not mean that.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"If I could only make you understand how very strong is my\ninclination, or disinclination--how impossible to be conquered,\nthen--\"\n\n\"What next?\"\n\n\"Then you would know that I could never give way, as you call it, and\nyou would go to work with your own conscience to see whether it be\nimperative with you or not. You may be sure of this,--I shall never\nsay a word to you in opposition to your conscience. If there be a\nword to be spoken it must come from yourself.\"\n\nThere was a long pause in the conversation, a silence for an hour,\nduring which the girl went in and out of the room and settled herself\ndown at her work. Then the old man went back abruptly to the subject\nthey had discussed. \"I shall obey my conscience.\"\n\n\"You ought to do so, Uncle Indefer. What should a man obey but his\nconscience?\"\n\n\"Though it will break my heart.\"\n\n\"No; no, no!\"\n\n\"And will ruin you.\"\n\n\"That is a flea's bite. I can brave my ruin easily, but not your\nbroken heart.\"\n\n\"Why should there be either, Isabel?\"\n\n\"Nay, sir; have you not said but now, because of our consciences?\nNot to save your heart from breaking,--though I think your heart\nis dearer to me than anything else in the world,--could I marry\nmy cousin Henry. We must die together, both of us, you and I, or\nlive broken-hearted, or what not, sooner than that. Would I not do\nanything possible at your bidding?\"\n\n\"I used to think so.\"\n\n\"But it is impossible for a young woman with a respect for herself\nsuch as I have to submit herself to a man that she loathes. Do as\nyour conscience bids you with the old house. Shall I be less tender\nto you while you live because I shall have to leave the place when\nyou are dead? Shall I accuse you of injustice or unkindness in\nmy heart? Never! All that is only an outside circumstance to me,\ncomparatively of little moment. But to be the wife of a man I\ndespise!\" Then she got up and left the room.\n\n\nA month passed by before the old man returned to the subject, which\nhe did seated in the same room, at the same hour of the day,--at\nabout four o'clock, when the dinner things had been removed.\n\n\"Isabel,\" he said, \"I cannot help myself.\"\n\n\"As to what, Uncle Indefer?\" She knew very well what was the matter\nin which, as he said, he could not help himself. Had there been\nanything in which his age had wanted assistance from her youth there\nwould have been no hesitation between them; no daughter was ever more\ntender; no father was ever more trusting. But on this subject it was\nnecessary that he should speak more plainly before she could reply to\nhim.\n\n\"As to your cousin and the property.\"\n\n\"Then in God's name do not trouble yourself further in looking for\nhelp where there is none to be had. You mean that the estate ought to\ngo to a man and not to a woman?\"\n\n\"It ought to go to a Jones.\"\n\n\"I am not a Jones, nor likely to become a Jones.\"\n\n\"You are as near to me as he is,--and so much dearer!\"\n\n\"But not on that account a Jones. My name is Isabel Brodrick. A woman\nnot born to be a Jones may have the luck to become one by marriage,\nbut that will never be the case with me.\"\n\n\"You should not laugh at that which is to me a duty.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear uncle!\" she said, caressing him, \"if I seemed to\nlaugh\"--and she certainly had laughed when she spoke of the luck of\nbecoming a Jones--\"it is only that you may feel how little importance\nI attach to it all on my own account.\"\n\n\"But it is important,--terribly important!\"\n\n\"Very well. Then go to work with two things in your mind fixed as\nfate. One is that you must leave Llanfeare to your nephew Henry\nJones, and the other that I will not marry your nephew Henry Jones.\nWhen it is all settled it will be just as though the old place were\nentailed, as it used to be.\"\n\n\"I wish it were.\"\n\n\"So do I, if it would save you trouble.\"\n\n\"But it isn't the same;--it can't be the same. In getting back the\nland your grandfather sold I have spent the money I had saved for\nyou.\"\n\n\"It shall be all the same to me, and I will take pleasure in thinking\nthat the old family place shall remain as you would have it. I can be\nproud of the family though I can never bear the name.\"\n\n\"You do not care a straw for the family.\"\n\n\"You should not say that, Uncle Indefer. It is not true. I care\nenough for the family to sympathise with you altogether in what you\nare doing, but not enough for the property to sacrifice myself in\norder that I might have a share in it.\"\n\n\"I do not know why you should think so much evil of Henry.\"\n\n\"Do you know any reason why I should think well enough of him to\nbecome his wife? I do not. In marrying a man a woman should be able\nto love every little trick belonging to him. The parings of his nails\nshould be a care to her. It should be pleasant to her to serve him in\nthings most menial. Would it be so to me, do you think, with Henry\nJones?\"\n\n\"You are always full of poetry and books.\"\n\n\"I should be full of something very bad if I were to allow myself to\nstand at the altar with him. Drop it, Uncle Indefer. Get it out of\nyour mind as a thing quite impossible. It is the one thing I can't\nand won't do, even for you. It is the one thing that you ought not to\nask me to do. Do as you like with the property,--as you think right.\"\n\n\"It is not as I like.\"\n\n\"As your conscience bids you, then; and I with myself, which is the\nonly little thing that I have in the world, will do as I like, or as\nmy conscience bids me.\"\n\nThese last words she spoke almost roughly, and as she said them she\nleft him, walking out of the room with an air of offended pride.\nBut in this there was a purpose. If she were hard to him, hard and\nobstinate in her determination, then would he be enabled to be so\nalso to her in his determination, with less of pain to himself. She\nfelt it to be her duty to teach him that he was justified in doing\nwhat he liked with his property, because she intended to do what\nshe liked with herself. Not only would she not say a word towards\ndissuading him from this change in his old intentions, but she would\nmake the change as little painful to him as possible by teaching him\nto think that it was justified by her own manner to him.\n\nFor there was a change, not only in his mind, but in his declared\nintentions. Llanfeare had belonged to Indefer Joneses for many\ngenerations. When the late Squire had died, now twenty years ago,\nthere had been remaining out of ten children only one, the eldest,\nto whom the property now belonged. Four or five coming in succession\nafter him had died without issue. Then there had been a Henry Jones,\nwho had gone away and married, had become the father of the Henry\nJones above mentioned, and had then also departed. The youngest, a\ndaughter, had married an attorney named Brodrick, and she also had\ndied, having no other child but Isabel. Mr Brodrick had married\nagain, and was now the father of a large family, living at Hereford,\nwhere he carried on his business. He was not very \"well-to-do\" in the\nworld. The new Mrs Brodrick had preferred her own babies to Isabel,\nand Isabel when she was fifteen years of age had gone to her bachelor\nuncle at Llanfeare. There she had lived for the last ten years,\nmaking occasional visits to her father at Hereford.\n\nMr Indefer Jones, who was now between seventy and eighty years old,\nwas a gentleman who through his whole life had been disturbed by\nreflections, fears, and hopes as to the family property on which he\nhad been born, on which he had always lived, in possession of which\nhe would certainly die, and as to the future disposition of which\nit was his lot in life to be altogether responsible. It had been\nentailed upon him before his birth in his grandfather's time, when\nhis father was about to be married. But the entail had not been\ncarried on. There had come no time in which this Indefer Jones had\nbeen about to be married, and the former old man having been given to\nextravagance, and been generally in want of money, had felt it more\ncomfortable to be without an entail. His son had occasionally been\ninduced to join with him in raising money. Thus not only since he had\nhimself owned the estate, but before his father's death, there had\nbeen forced upon him reflections as to the destination of Llanfeare.\nAt fifty he had found himself unmarried, and unlikely to marry.\nHis brother Henry was then alive; but Henry had disgraced the\nfamily,--had run away with a married woman whom he had married after\na divorce, had taken to race courses and billiard-rooms, and had been\naltogether odious to his brother Indefer. Nevertheless the boy which\nhad come from this marriage, a younger Henry, had been educated at\nhis expense, and had occasionally been received at Llanfeare. He\nhad been popular with no one there, having been found to be a sly\nboy, given to lying, and, as even the servants said about the place,\nunlike a Jones of Llanfeare. Then had come the time in which Isabel\nhad been brought to Llanfeare. Henry had been sent away from Oxford\nfor some offence not altogether trivial, and the Squire had declared\nto himself and others that Llanfeare should never fall into his\nhands.\n\nIsabel had so endeared herself to him that before she had been\ntwo years in the house she was the young mistress of the place.\nEverything that she did was right in his eyes. She might have\nanything that she would ask, only that she would ask for nothing. At\nthis time the cousin had been taken into an office in London, and had\nbecome,--so it was said of him,--a steady young man of business. But\nstill, when allowed to show himself at Llanfeare, he was unpalatable\nto them all--unless it might be to the old Squire. It was certainly\nthe case that in his office in London he made himself useful, and it\nseemed that he had abandoned that practice of running into debt and\nhaving the bills sent down to Llanfeare which he had adopted early in\nhis career.\n\nDuring all this time the old Squire was terribly troubled about\nthe property. His will was always close at his hand. Till Isabel\nwas twenty-one this will had always been in Henry's favour,--with\na clause, however, that a certain sum of money which the Squire\npossessed should go to her. Then in his disgust towards his nephew he\nchanged his purpose, and made another will in Isabel's favour. This\nremained in existence as his last resolution for three years; but\nthey had been three years of misery to him. He had endured but badly\nthe idea that the place should pass away out of what he regarded as\nthe proper male line. To his thinking it was simply an accident that\nthe power of disposing of the property should be in his hands. It\nwas a religion to him that a landed estate in Britain should go from\nfather to eldest son, and in default of a son to the first male heir.\nBritain would not be ruined because Llanfeare should be allowed to go\nout of the proper order. But Britain would be ruined if Britons did\nnot do their duty in that sphere of life to which it had pleased God\nto call them; and in this case his duty was to maintain the old order\nof things.\n\nAnd during this time an additional trouble added itself to those\nexisting. Having made up his mind to act in opposition to his own\nprinciples, and to indulge his own heart; having declared both to his\nnephew and to his niece that Isabel should be his heir, there came\nto him, as a consolation in his misery, the power of repurchasing\na certain fragment of the property which his father, with his\nassistance, had sold. The loss of these acres had been always a sore\nwound to him, not because of his lessened income, but from a feeling\nthat no owner of an estate should allow it to be diminished during\nhis holding of it. He never saw those separated fields estranged from\nLlanfeare, but he grieved in his heart. That he might get them back\nagain he had saved money since Llanfeare had first become his own.\nThen had come upon him the necessity of providing for Isabel. But\nwhen with many groans he had decided that Isabel should be the heir,\nthe money could be allowed to go for its intended purpose. It had\nso gone, and then his conscience had become too strong for him, and\nanother will was made.\n\nIt will be seen how he had endeavoured to reconcile things. When\nit was found that Henry Jones was working like a steady man at the\nLondon office to which he was attached, that he had sown his wild\noats, then Uncle Indefer began to ask himself why all his dearest\nwishes should not be carried out together by a marriage between the\ncousins. \"I don't care a bit for his wild oats,\" Isabel had said,\nalmost playfully, when the idea had first been mooted to her. \"His\noats are too tame for me rather than too wild. Why can't he look any\none in the face?\" Then her uncle had been angry with her, thinking\nthat she was allowing a foolish idea to interfere with the happiness\nof them all.\n\nBut his anger with her was never enduring; and, indeed, before the\ntime at which our story commenced he had begun to acknowledge to\nhimself that he might rather be afraid of her anger than she of his.\nThere was a courage about her which nothing could dash. She had grown\nup under his eyes strong, brave, sometimes almost bold, with a dash\nof humour, but always quite determined in her own ideas of wrong\nor right. He had in truth been all but afraid of her when he found\nhimself compelled to tell her of the decision to which his conscience\ncompelled him. But the will was made,--the third, perhaps the fourth\nor fifth, which had seemed to him to be necessary since his mind had\nbeen exercised in this matter. He made this will, which he assured\nhimself should be the last, leaving Llanfeare to his nephew on\ncondition that he should prefix the name of Indefer to that of Jones,\nand adding certain stipulations as to further entail. Then everything\nof which he might die possessed, except Llanfeare itself and the\nfurniture in the house, he left to his niece Isabel.\n\n\"We must get rid of the horses,\" he said to her about a fortnight\nafter the conversation last recorded.\n\n\"Why that?\"\n\n\"My will has been made, and there will be so little now for you, that\nwe must save what we can before I die.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother me!\" said Isabel, laughing.\n\n\"Do you suppose it is not dreadful to me to have to reflect how\nlittle I can do for you? I may, perhaps, live for two years, and we\nmay save six or seven hundred a year. I have put a charge on the\nestate for four thousand pounds. The property is only a small thing,\nafter all;--not above fifteen hundred a year.\"\n\n\"I will not hear of the horses being sold, and there is an end of it.\nYou have been taken out about the place every day for the last twenty\nyears, and it would crush me if I were to see a change. You have done\nthe best you can, and now leave it all in God's hands. Pray,--pray\nlet there be no more talking about it. If you only knew how welcome\nhe is to it!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIsabel Brodrick\n\n\nWhen Mr Indefer Jones spoke of living for two years, he spoke more\nhopefully of himself than the doctor was wont to speak to Isabel. The\ndoctor from Carmarthen visited Llanfeare twice a week, and having\nbecome intimate and confidential with Isabel, had told her that the\ncandle had nearly burnt itself down to the socket. There was no\nspecial disease, but he was a worn-out old man. It was well that he\nshould allow himself to be driven out about the place every day. It\nwas well that he should be encouraged to get up after breakfast, and\nto eat his dinner in the middle of the day after his old fashion.\nIt was well to do everything around him as though he were not a\nconfirmed invalid. But the doctor thought that he would not last\nlong. The candle, as the doctor said, had nearly burnt itself out in\nthe socket.\n\nAnd yet there was no apparent decay in the old man's intellect. He\nhad never been much given to literary pursuits, but that which he had\nalways done he did still. A daily copy of whatever might be the most\nthoroughly Conservative paper of the day he always read carefully\nfrom the beginning to the end; and a weekly copy of the _Guardian_\nnearly filled up the hours which were devoted to study. On Sunday\nhe read two sermons through, having been forbidden by the doctor to\ntake his place in the church because of the draughts, and thinking,\napparently, that it would be mean and wrong to make that an excuse\nfor shirking an onerous duty. An hour a day was devoted by him\nreligiously to the Bible. The rest of his time was occupied by the\ncare of his property. Nothing gratified him so much as the coming\nin of one of his tenants, all of whom were so intimately known to\nhim that, old as he was, he never forgot the names even of their\nchildren. The idea of raising a rent was abominable to him. Around\nthe house there were about two hundred acres which he was supposed to\nfarm. On these some half-dozen worn-out old labourers were maintained\nin such a manner that no return from the land was ever forthcoming.\nOn this subject he would endure remonstrance from no one,--not even\nfrom Isabel.\n\nSuch as he has been here described, he would have been a happy\nold man during these last half-dozen years, had not his mind been\nexercised day by day, and hour by hour, by these cares as to the\nproperty which were ever present to him. A more loving heart than his\ncould hardly be found in a human bosom, and all its power of love had\nbeen bestowed on Isabel. Nor could any man be subject to a stronger\nfeeling of duty than that which pervaded him; and this feeling of\nduty induced him to declare to himself that in reference to his\nproperty he was bound to do that which was demanded of him by the\nestablished custom of his order. In this way he had become an unhappy\nman, troubled by conflicting feelings, and was now, as he was\napproaching the hour of his final departure, tormented by the thought\nthat he would leave his niece without sufficient provision for her\nwants.\n\nBut the thing was done. The new will was executed and tied in on the\ntop of the bundle which contained the other wills which he had made.\nThen, naturally enough, there came back upon him the idea, hardly\namounting to a hope, that something might even yet occur to set\nmatters right by a marriage between the cousins. Isabel had spoken\nto him so strongly on the subject that he did not dare to repeat his\nrequest. And yet, he thought, there was no good reason why they two\nshould not become man and wife. Henry, as far as he could learn, had\ngiven up his bad courses. The man was not evil to the eye, a somewhat\ncold-looking man rather than otherwise, tall with well-formed\nfeatures, with light hair and blue-grey eyes, not subject to be\nspoken of as being unlike a gentleman, if not noticeable as being\nlike one. That inability of his to look one in the face when he was\nspeaking had not struck the Squire forcibly as it had done Isabel. He\nwould not have been agreeable to the Squire had there been no bond\nbetween them,--would still have been the reverse, as he had been\nformerly, but for that connexion. But, as things were, there was room\nfor an attempt at love; and if for an attempt at love on his part,\nwhy not also on Isabel's? But he did not dare to bid Isabel even to\ntry to love this cousin.\n\n\"I think I would like to have him down again soon,\" he said to his\nniece.\n\n\"By all means. The more the tenants know him the better it will be. I\ncan go to Hereford at any time.\"\n\n\"Why should you run away from me?\"\n\n\"Not from you, Uncle Indefer, but from him.\"\n\n\"And why from him?\"\n\n\"Because I don't love him.\"\n\n\"Must you always run away from the people you do not love?\"\n\n\"Yes, when the people, or person, is a man, and when the man has been\ntold that he ought specially to love me.\"\n\nWhen she said this she looked into her uncle's face, smiling indeed,\nbut still asking a serious question. He dared to make no answer, but\nby his face he told the truth. He had declared his wishes to his\nnephew.\n\n\"Not that I mean to be in the least afraid of him,\" she continued.\n\"Perhaps it will be better that I should see him, and if he speaks to\nme have it out with him. How long would he stay?\"\n\n\"A month, I suppose. He can come for a month.\"\n\n\"Then I'll stay for the first week. I must go to Hereford before the\nsummer is over. Shall I write to him?\" Then it was settled as she\nhad proposed. She wrote all her uncle's letters, even to her cousin\nHenry, unless there was, by chance, something very special to be\ncommunicated. On the present occasion she sent the invitation as\nfollows:--\n\n\n   Llanfeare, 17th June, 187--, Monday.\n\n   MY DEAR HENRY,\n\n   Your uncle wants you to come here on the 1st July and stay\n   for a month. The 1st of July will be Monday. Do not travel\n   on a Sunday as you did last time, because he does not like\n   it. I shall be here the first part of the time, and then\n   I shall go to Hereford. It is in the middle of the summer\n   only that I can leave him. Your affectionate cousin,\n\n   ISABEL BRODRICK.\n\n\nShe had often felt herself compelled to sign herself to him in that\nway, and it had gone much against the grain with her; but to a\ncousin it was the ordinary thing, as it is to call any different man\n\"My dear sir,\" though he be not in the least dear. And so she had\nreconciled herself to the falsehood.\n\nAnother incident in Isabel's life must be told to the reader. It\nwas her custom to go to Hereford at least once a year, and there to\nremain at her father's house for a month. These visits had been made\nannually since she had lived at Llanfeare, and in this way she had\nbecome known to many of the Hereford people. Among others who had\nthus become her friends there was a young clergyman, William Owen, a\nminor canon attached to the cathedral, who during her last visit had\nasked her to be his wife. At that time she had supposed herself to\nbe her uncle's heiress, and looking at herself as the future owner\nof Llanfeare had considered herself bound to regard such an offer in\nreference to her future duties and to the obedience which she owed\nto her uncle. She never told her lover, not did she ever quite tell\nherself, that she would certainly accept him if bound by no such\nconsiderations; but we may tell the reader that it was so. Had she\nfelt herself to be altogether free, she would have given herself to\nthe man who had offered her his love. As it was she answered him\nanything but hopefully, saying nothing of any passion of her own,\nspeaking of herself as though she were altogether at the disposal of\nher uncle. \"He has decided now,\" she said, \"that when he is gone the\nproperty is to be mine.\" The minor canon, who had heard nothing of\nthis, drew himself up as though about to declare in his pride that he\nhad not intended to ask for the hand of the lady of Llanfeare. \"That\nwould make no difference in me,\" she continued, reading plainly\nthe expression in the young man's face. \"My regard would be swayed\nneither one way nor the other by any feeling of that kind. But as he\nhas chosen to make me his daughter, I must obey him as his daughter.\nIt is not probable that he will consent to such a marriage.\"\n\nThen there had been nothing further between them till Isabel, on her\nreturn to Llanfeare, had written to him to say that her uncle had\ndecided against the marriage, and that his decision was final.\n\nNow in all this Isabel had certainly been hardly used, though her\nill-usage had in part been due to her own reticence as to her own\nfeelings. When she told the Squire that the offer had been made to\nher, she did so as if she herself had been almost indifferent.\n\n\"William Owen!\" the Squire had said, repeating the name; \"his\ngrandfather kept the inn at Pembroke!\"\n\n\"I believe he did,\" said Isabel calmly.\n\n\"And you would wish to make him owner of Llanfeare?\"\n\n\"I did not say so,\" rejoined Isabel. \"I have told you what occurred,\nand have asked you what you thought.\"\n\nThen the Squire shook his head, and there was an end of it. The\nletter was written to the minor canon telling him that the Squire's\ndecision was final.\n\nIn all this there had been no allusion to love on the part of Isabel.\nHad there been, her uncle could hardly have pressed upon her the\nclaims of his nephew. But her manner in regard to the young clergyman\nhad been so cold as to leave upon her uncle an impression that the\nmatter was one of but little moment. To Isabel it was matter of\ninfinite moment. And yet when she was asked again and again to\narrange all the difficulties of the family by marrying her cousin,\nshe was forced to carry on the conversation as though no such person\nexisted as her lover at Hereford.\n\nAnd yet the Squire remembered it all,--remembered that when he had\nthus positively objected to the grandson of the innkeeper, he had\ndone so because he had felt it to be his duty to keep the grandson of\nan innkeeper out of Llanfeare. That the grandson of old Thomas Owen,\nof the Pembroke Lion, should reign at Llanfeare in the place of\nan Indefer Jones had been abominable to him. To prevent that had\ncertainly been within his duties. But it was very different now, when\nhe would leave his girl poorly provided for, without a friend and\nwithout a roof of her own over her head! And yet, though her name was\nBrodrick, she, too, was a Jones; and her father, though an attorney,\nhad come of a family nearly as good as his own. In no case could\nit be right that she should marry the grandson of old Thomas Owen.\nTherefore, hitherto, he had never again referred to that proposal of\nmarriage. Should she again have spoken of it his answer might perhaps\nhave been less decided; but neither had she again spoken of the\nclergyman.\n\nAll this was hard upon Isabel, who, if she said nothing, still\nthought of her lover. And it must be acknowledged also that though\nshe did not speak, still she thought of her future prospects. She had\nlaughed at the idea of being solicitous as to her inheritance. She\nhad done so in order that she might thereby lessen the trouble of\nher uncle's mind; but she knew as well as did another the difference\nbetween the position which had been promised her as owner of\nLlanfeare, and that to which she would be reduced as the stepdaughter\nof a stepmother who did not love her. She knew, too, that she had\nbeen cold to William Owen, giving him no sort of encouragement,\nhaving seemed to declare to him that she had rejected him because\nshe was her uncle's heiress. And she knew also,--or thought that\nshe knew,--that she was not possessed of those feminine gifts which\nprobably might make a man constant under difficulties. No more had\nbeen heard of William Owen during the last nine months. Every now and\nthen a letter would come to her from one of her younger sisters, who\nnow had their own anxieties and their own loves, but not a word was\nthere in one of them of William Owen. Therefore, it may be said that\nthe last change in her uncle's purpose had fallen upon her with\npeculiar hardness.\n\nBut she never uttered a complaint, or even looked one. As for\nutterance there was no one to whom she could have spoken it. There\nhad never been many words between her and her own family as to the\ninheritance. As she had been reticent to her father so had he to\nher. The idea in the attorney's house at Hereford was that she was\nstubborn, conceited, and disdainful. It may be that in regard to her\nstepmother there was something of this, but, let that be as it might,\nthere had been but little confidence between them as to matters at\nLlanfeare. It was, no doubt, supposed by her father that she was to\nbe her uncle's heir.\n\nConceited, perhaps, she was as to certain gifts of character. She did\nbelieve herself to be strong of purpose and capable of endurance. But\nin some respects she was humble enough. She gave herself no credit\nfor feminine charms such as the world loves. In appearance she was\none calculated to attract attention,--somewhat tall, well set on her\nlimbs, active, and of good figure; her brow was broad and fine, her\ngrey eyes were bright and full of intelligence, her nose and mouth\nwere well formed, and there was not a mean feature in her face.\nBut there was withal a certain roughness about her, an absence of\nfeminine softness in her complexion, which, to tell the truth of her,\nwas more conspicuous to her own eyes than to any others. The farmers\nand their wives about the place would declare that Miss Isabel was\nthe finest young woman in South Wales. With the farmers and their\nwives she was on excellent terms, knowing all their ways, and anxious\nas to all their wants. With the gentry around she concerned herself\nbut little. Her uncle's habits were not adapted to the keeping of\nmuch company, and to her uncle's habits she had fitted herself\naltogether. It was on this account that neither did she know the\nyoung men around, nor did they know her. And then, because no such\nintimacies had grown up she told herself that she was unlike other\ngirls,--that she was rough, unattractive, and unpopular.\n\nThen the day came for the arrival of Henry Jones, during the approach\nto which Uncle Indefer had, from day to day, become more and more\nuneasy. Isabel had ceased to say a word against him. When he had been\nproposed to her as a lover she had declared that she had loathed\nhim. Now that suggestion had been abandoned, or left in abeyance.\nTherefore she dealt with his name and with his coming as she might\nwith that of any other guest. She looked to his room, and asked\nquestions as to his comfort. Would it not be well to provide a\nseparate dinner for him, seeing that three o'clock would be regarded\nas an awkward hour by a man from London? \"If he doesn't like it, he\nhad better go back to London,\" said the old Squire in anger. But the\nanger was not intended against his girl, but against the man who by\nthe mere force of his birth was creating such a sea of troubles.\n\n\"I have told you what my intentions are,\" the Squire said to his\nnephew on the evening of his arrival.\n\n\"I am sure that I am very much obliged to you, my dear uncle.\"\n\n\"You need not be in the least obliged to me. I have done what I\nconceive to be a duty. I can still change it if I find that you do\nnot deserve it. As for Isabel, she deserves everything that can be\ndone for her. Isabel has never given me the slightest cause for\ndispleasure. I doubt whether there is a better creature in the\nworld living than Isabel. She deserves everything. But as you are\nthe male heir, I think it right that you should follow me in the\nproperty--unless you show yourself to be unworthy.\"\n\nThis was certainly a greeting hard to be endured,--a speech very\ndifficult to answer. Nevertheless it was satisfactory, if only the\nold Squire would not again change his mind. The young man had thought\nmuch about it, and had come to the resolution that the best way to\ninsure the good things promised him would be to induce Isabel to be\nhis wife.\n\n\"I'm sure she is all that you say, Uncle Indefer,\" he replied.\n\nUncle Indefer grunted, and told him that if he wanted any supper, he\nhad better go and get it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nCousin Henry\n\n\nCousin Henry found his position to be difficult and precarious. That\nsuggestion of his uncle's,--or rather assertion,--that he could still\nchange his mind was disagreeable. No doubt he could do so, and, as\nCousin Henry thought, would be the very man to do it, if angered,\nthwarted, or even annoyed. He knew that more than one will had\nalready been made and set aside. Cousin Henry had turned the whole\nmatter very much in his mind since he had become cognizant of his\nuncle's character. However imprudent he might have been in his\nearlier days, he was now quite alive to the importance of being\nSquire of Llanfeare. There was nothing that he was not ready to do to\nplease and conciliate his uncle. Llanfeare without Isabel as a burden\nwould no doubt be preferable, but he was quite ready to marry Isabel\nto-morrow, if Isabel would only accept him. The game he had to play\nwas for Llanfeare. It was to be Llanfeare or nothing. The position\noffered to him was to come, not from love, but from a sense of duty\non the part of the old man. If he could keep the old man firm to that\nidea, Llanfeare would be his own; but should he be excluded from\nthat inheritance, there would be no lesser prize by which he might\nreconcile himself to the loss. His uncle would not leave him anything\nfrom love. All this he understood thoroughly, and was therefore not\nunnaturally nervous as to his own conduct at the present crisis.\n\nIt was only too manifest to him that his uncle did in fact dislike\nhim. At their very first interview he was made to listen to praises\nof Isabel and threats against himself. He was quite prepared to put\nup with both, or with any other disagreeable hardship which might\nbe inflicted upon him, if only he could do so successfully. But he\nbelieved that his best course would be to press his suit with Isabel.\nShould he do so successfully, he would at any rate be safe. Should\nshe be persistent in refusing him, which he believed to be probable,\nthen he would have shown himself desirous of carrying out his uncle's\nwishes. As to all this he was clear-sighted enough. But he did not\nquite perceive the state of his uncle's mind in regard to himself. He\ndid not understand how painfully the old man was still vacillating\nbetween affection and duty; nor did he fathom the depth of the love\nwhich his uncle felt for Isabel. Had he been altogether wise in the\nmatter, he would have kept out of his uncle's presence, and have\ndevoted himself to the tenants and the land; but in lieu of this, he\nintruded himself as much as possible into his uncle's morning room,\noften to the exclusion of Isabel. Now it had come to pass that Uncle\nIndefer was never at his ease unless his niece were with him.\n\n\"Nobody can be more attached to another than I am to Isabel,\"\nsaid the nephew to his uncle on the third morning of his arrival.\nWhereupon Uncle Indefer grunted. The more he saw of the man, the less\nhe himself liked the idea of sacrificing Isabel to such a husband. \"I\nshall certainly do my best to carry out your wishes.\"\n\n\"My wishes have reference solely to her.\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir; I understand that completely. As she is not to be the\nheiress, the best thing possible is to be done for her.\"\n\n\"You think that marrying you would be the best thing possible!\" This\nthe uncle said in a tone of scorn which must have been very hard to\nbear. And it was unjust too, as the unfortunate nephew had certainly\nnot intended to speak of himself personally as being the best thing\npossible for Isabel.\n\nBut this too had to be borne. \"I meant, sir, that if she would accept\nmy hand, she would have pretty nearly as great an interest in the\nproperty as I myself.\"\n\n\"She would have much more,\" said Uncle Indefer angrily. \"She knows\nevery man, woman, and child about the place. There is not one of them\nwho does not love her. And so they ought, for she has been their best\nfriend. As far as they are concerned it is almost cruel that they\nshould not be left in her hands.\"\n\n\"So it will be, sir, if she will consent to do as you and I wish.\"\n\n\"Wish! Pshaw!\" Then he repeated his grunts, turning his shoulder\nround against his nephew, and affecting to read the newspaper\nwhich he had held in his hand during the conversation. It must be\nacknowledged that the part to be played by the intended heir was very\ndifficult. He could perceive that his uncle hated him, but he could\nnot understand that he might best lessen that hatred by relieving his\nuncle of his presence. There he sat looking at the empty grate, and\npretending now and again to read an old newspaper which was lying on\nthe table, while his uncle fumed and grunted. During every moment\nthat was so passed Uncle Indefer was asking himself whether that\nBritish custom as to male heirs was absolutely essential to the\nwelfare of the country. Here were two persons suggested to his\nmind, one of whom was to be his future successor. One of them was\nundoubtedly the sweetest human being that had ever crossed his path;\nthe other,--as he was inclined to think at the present moment,--was\nthe least sweet. And as they were to him, would they not be to the\ntenants whose welfare was to depend so much on the future owner of\nthe property? The longer that he endured the presence of the man the\nmore desirous did he feel of turning to the drawer which was close at\nhand, and destroying the topmost of those documents which lay there\ntied in a bundle together.\n\nBut he did not allow himself to be at once driven to a step so\nunreasonable. The young man had done nothing which ought to offend\nhim,--had, indeed, only obeyed him in coming down to South Wales.\nThat custom of the country was good and valid, and wise. If\nhe believed in anything of the world worldly, he believed in\nprimogeniture in respect of land. Though Isabel was ever so sweet,\nduty was duty. Who was he that he should dare to say to himself that\nhe could break through what he believed to be a law on his conscience\nwithout a sin? If he might permit himself to make a special exemption\nfor himself in the indulgence of his own affection, then why might\nnot another, and another, and so on? Did he not know that it would\nhave been better that the whole thing should have been settled for\nhim by an entail? And, if so, how could it be right that he should\nact in opposition to the spirit of such an entail, merely because he\nhad the power to do so? Thus he argued with himself again and again;\nbut these arguments would never become strong till his nephew had\nrelieved him of his presence.\n\nWhile he was so arguing, Cousin Henry was trying his hand with\nIsabel. There had been but a week for him to do it, and three days\nhad already passed away. At the end of the week Isabel was to go to\nHereford, and Henry, as far as he knew, was still expected by his\nuncle to make an offer to his cousin. And, as regarded himself,\nhe was well enough disposed to do so. He was a man with no strong\naffections, but also with no strong aversions,--except that at\npresent he had a strong affection for Llanfeare, and a strong\naversion to the monotonous office in which he was wont to earn his\ndaily bread up in London. And he, too, was desirous of doing his\nduty,--as long as the doing of his duty might tend to the desired\npossession of Llanfeare. He was full of the idea that a great deal\nwas due to Isabel. A great deal was certainly due to Isabel, if only,\nby admitting so much, his possession of Llanfeare was to be assured.\n\n\"So you are going away in two or three days?\" he said to her.\n\n\"In four days. I am to start on Monday.\"\n\n\"That is very soon. I am so sorry that you are to leave us! But I\nsuppose it is best that dear Uncle Indefer should not be left alone.\"\n\n\"I should have gone at this time in any case,\" said Isabel, who would\nnot allow it to be supposed that he could fill her place near their\nuncle.\n\n\"Nevertheless I am sorry that you should not have remained while I am\nhere. Of course it cannot be helped.\" Then he paused, but she had not\na word further to say. She could see by the anxiety displayed in his\nface, and by a more than usually unnatural tone in his voice, that he\nwas about to make his proposition. She was quite prepared for it, and\nremained silent, fixed, and attentive. \"Isabel,\" he said, \"I suppose\nUncle Indefer has told you what he intends?\"\n\n\"I should say so. I think he always tells me what he intends.\"\n\n\"About the property I mean.\"\n\n\"Yes; about the property. I believe he has made a will leaving it to\nyou. I believe he has done this, not because he loves you the best,\nbut because he thinks it ought to go to the male heir. I quite agree\nwith him that these things should not be governed by affection. He is\nso good that he will certainly do what he believes to be his duty.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless the effect is the same.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; as regards you, the effect will be the same. You will have\nthe property, whether it comes from love or duty.\"\n\n\"And you will lose it.\"\n\n\"I cannot lose what never was mine,\" she said, smiling.\n\n\"But why should we not both have it,--one as well as the other?\"\n\n\"No; we can't do that.\"\n\n\"Yes, we can; if you will do what I wish, and what he wishes also. I\nlove you with all my heart.\"\n\nShe opened her eyes as though driven to do so by surprise. She knew\nthat she should not have expressed herself in that way, but she could\nnot avoid the temptation.\n\n\"I do, indeed, with all my heart. Why should we not--marry, you know?\nThen the property would belong to both of us.\"\n\n\"Yes; then it would.\"\n\n\"Why should we not; eh, Isabel?\" Then he approached her as though\nabout to make some ordinary symptom of a lover's passion.\n\n\"Sit down there, Henry, and I will tell you why we cannot do that. I\ndo not love you in the least.\"\n\n\"You might learn to love me.\"\n\n\"Never; never! That lesson would be impossible to me. Now let there\nbe an end of it. Uncle Indefer has, I dare say, asked you to make\nthis proposition.\"\n\n\"He wrote a letter, just saying that he would like it.\"\n\n\"Exactly so. You have found yourself compelled to do his bidding, and\nyou have done it. Then let there be an end of it. I would not marry\nan angel even to oblige him or to get Llanfeare; and you are not an\nangel,--to my way of thinking.\"\n\n\"I don't know about angels,\" he said, trying still to be\ngood-humoured.\n\n\"No, no. That was my nonsense. There is no question of angels. But\nnot for all Llanfeare, not even to oblige him, would I undertake to\nmarry a man even if I were near to loving him. I should have to love\nhim entirely, without reference to Llanfeare. I am not at all near\nloving you.\"\n\n\"Why not, Isabel?\" he asked foolishly.\n\n\"Because--because--because you are odious to me!\"\n\n\"Isabel!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon. I should not have said so. It was very wrong;\nbut, then, why did you ask so foolish a question? Did I not tell you\nto let there be an end of it? And now will you let me give you one\nlittle bit of advice?\"\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked angrily. He was beginning to hate her, though\nhe was anxious to repress his hatred, lest by indulging it he should\ninjure his prospects.\n\n\"Do not say a word about me to my uncle. It will be better for you\nnot to tell him that there has been between us any such interview as\nthis. If he did once wish that you and I should become man and wife,\nI do not think that he wishes it now. Let the thing slide, as they\nsay. He has quite made up his mind in your favour, because it is his\nduty. Unless you do something to displease him very greatly, he will\nmake no further change. Do not trouble him more than you can help by\ntalking to him on things that are distasteful. Anything in regard to\nme, coming from you, will be distasteful to him. You had better go\nabout among the farms, and see the tenants, and learn the condition\nof everything. And then talk to him about that. Whatever you do,\nnever suggest that the money coming from it all is less than it ought\nto be. That is my advice. And now, if you please, you and I need not\ntalk about it any more.\" Then she got up and left the room without\nwaiting for a reply.\n\nWhen he was alone he resolved upon complying with her advice, at any\nrate in one respect. He would not renew his offer of marriage; nor\nwould he hold any further special conversation with her. Of course,\nshe was hateful to him, having declared so plainly to him her own\nopinion regarding himself. He had made the offer, and had thereby\ndone his duty. He had made the offer, and had escaped.\n\nBut he did not at all believe in the sincerity of her advice as to\ntheir uncle. His heart was throbbing with the desire to secure the\ninheritance to himself,--and so he thought, no doubt, was hers as to\nherself. It might be that the old man's intention would depend upon\nhis obedience, and if so, it was certainly necessary that the old man\nshould know that he had been obedient. Of course, he would tell the\nold man what he had done.\n\nBut he said not a word till Isabel had gone. He did take her advice\nabout the land and the tenants, but hardly to much effect. If there\nwere a falling roof here or a half-hung door there, he displayed his\nzeal by telling the Squire of these defaults. But the Squire hated\nto hear of such defaults. It must be acknowledged that it would have\nrequired a man of very great parts to have given satisfaction in the\nposition in which this young man was placed.\n\nBut as soon as Isabel was gone he declared his obedience.\n\n\"I have asked her, sir, and she has refused me,\" he said in a\nmelancholy, low, and sententious voice.\n\n\"What did you expect?\"\n\n\"At any rate, I did as you would have me.\"\n\n\"Was she to jump down your throat when you asked her?\"\n\n\"She was very decided,--very. Of course, I spoke of your wishes.\"\n\n\"I have not any wishes.\"\n\n\"I thought that you desired it.\"\n\n\"So I did, but I have changed my mind. It would not do at all. I\nalmost wonder how you could have had the courage to ask her. I don't\nsuppose that you have the insight to see that she is different from\nother girls.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I perceived that.\"\n\n\"And yet you would go and ask her to be your wife off-hand, just as\nthough you were going to buy a horse! I suppose you told her that it\nwould be a good thing because of the estate?\"\n\n\"I did mention it,\" said the young man, altogether astounded and put\nbeyond himself by his uncle's manner and words.\n\n\"Yes; just as if it were a bargain! If you will consent to put up\nwith me as a husband, why, then you can go shares with me in the\nproperty. That was the kind of thing, wasn't it? And then you come\nand tell me that you have done your duty by making the offer!\"\n\nThe heir expectant was then convinced that it would have been better\nfor him to have followed the advice which Isabel had given him, but\nyet he could not bring himself to believe that the advice had been\ndisinterested. Why should Isabel have given him disinterested advice\nin opposition to her own prospects? Must not Isabel's feeling about\nthe property be the same as his own?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe Squire's Death\n\n\nWith a sore heart Isabel went her way to Hereford,--troubled because\nshe saw nothing but sorrow and vexation in store for her uncle.\n\n\"I know that I am getting weaker every day,\" he said. And yet it was\nnot long since he had spoken of living for two years.\n\n\"Shall I stay?\" asked Isabel.\n\n\"No; that would be wrong. You ought to go to your father. I suppose\nthat I shall live till you come back.\"\n\n\"Oh, Uncle Indefer!\"\n\n\"What if I did die? It is not that that troubles me.\" Then she\nkissed him and left him. She knew how vain it was to ask any further\nquestions, understanding thoroughly the nature of his sorrow. The\nidea that this nephew must be the master of Llanfeare was so bitter\nto him that he could hardly endure it; and then, added to this, was\nthe vexation of the nephew's presence. That three weeks should be\npassed alone with the man,--three weeks of the little that was left\nto him of life, seemed to be a cruel addition to the greater sorrow!\nBut Isabel went, and the uncle and nephew were left to do the best\nthey could with each other's company.\n\nIsabel had not seen Mr Owen or heard from him since the writing of\nthat letter in which she had told him of her uncle's decision. Now it\nwould be necessary that she should meet him, and she looked forward\nto doing so almost with fear and trembling. On one point she had made\nup her mind, or thought that she had made up her mind. As she had\nrefused him when supposed to be heiress of Llanfeare, she certainly\nwould not accept him, should he feel himself constrained by a sense\nof honour to renew his offer to her now that her position was so\ndifferent. She had not accused him in her own heart of having come\nto her because of her supposed wealth. Thinking well of him in other\nmatters, she thought well of him also in that. But still there was\nthe fact that she had refused him when supposed to be an heiress; and\nnot even to secure her happiness would she allow him to think that\nshe accepted him because of her altered circumstances. And yet she\nwas in love with him, and had now acknowledged to herself that it was\nso. Her position in this as in all things seemed to be so cruel! Had\nshe been the heiress of Llanfeare she could not have married him,\nbecause it would then have been her duty to comply with the wishes of\nher uncle. No such duty would now be imposed upon her, at any rate\nafter her uncle's death. As simple Isabel Brodrick she might marry\nwhom she would without bringing discredit upon the Indefer Joneses.\nBut that which she had been constrained to do before her uncle had\nchanged his purpose now tied her hands.\n\nIt did seem to her cruel; but she told herself that it was peculiarly\nher duty to bear such cruelty without complaint. Of her uncle's\nintense love to her she was fully aware, and, loving him as warmly,\nwas prepared to bear everything on his account. His vacillation had\nbeen unfortunate for her, but in everything he had done the best\naccording to his lights. Perhaps there was present to her mind\nsomething of the pride of a martyr. Perhaps she gloried a little in\nthe hardship of her position. But she was determined to have her\nglory and her martyrdom all to herself. No human being should ever\nhear from her lips a word of complaint against her Uncle Indefer.\n\nThe day after her arrival her father asked her a few questions as to\nher uncle's intentions in reference to the property.\n\n\"I think it is all settled,\" she said. \"I think it has been left to\nmy Cousin Henry.\"\n\n\"Then he has changed his mind,\" said her father angrily. \"He did mean\nto make you his heiress?\"\n\n\"Henry is at Llanfeare now, and Henry will be his heir.\"\n\n\"Why has he changed? Nothing can be more unjust than to make a\npromise in such a matter and then to break it.\"\n\n\"Who says that he made a promise? You have never heard anything\nof the kind from me. Papa, I would so much rather not talk about\nLlanfeare. Ever since I have known him, Uncle Indefer has been all\nlove to me. I would not allow a thought of mine to be polluted by\ningratitude towards him. Whatever he has done, he has done because he\nhas thought it to be the best. Perhaps I ought to tell you that he\nhas made some charge on the property on my behalf, which will prevent\nmy being a burden upon you.\"\n\nA week or ten days after this, when she had been nearly a fortnight\nat Hereford, she was told that William Owen was coming in to drink\ntea. This communication was made to her by her stepmother, in\nthat serious tone which is always intended to convey a matter of\nimportance. Had any other minor canon or any other gentleman been\ncoming to tea, the fact would have been announced in a different\nmanner.\n\n\"I shall be delighted to see him,\" said Isabel, suppressing with her\nusual fortitude any slightest symptom of emotion.\n\n\"I hope you will, my dear. I am sure he is very anxious to see you.\"\n\nThen Mr Owen came and drank his tea in the midst of the family.\nIsabel could perceive that he was somewhat confused,--not quite able\nto talk in his usual tone, and that he was especially anxious as\nto his manner towards her. She took her part in the conversation\nas though there were nothing peculiar in the meeting. She spoke of\nLlanfeare, of her uncle's failing health, and of her cousin's visit,\ntaking care to indicate by some apparently chance word, that Henry\nwas received there as the heir. She played her part well, evincing no\nsign of special feeling but her ear was awake to the slightest tone\nin his voice after he had received the information she had given\nhim. She knew that his voice was altered, but she did not read the\nalteration altogether aright.\n\n\"I shall call in the morning,\" he said, as he gave her his hand\nat parting. There was no pressure of the hand, but still he had\naddressed himself especially to her.\n\nWhy should he come in the morning? She had made up her mind, at the\nspur of the moment, that the news which he had heard had settled that\nmatter for ever. But if so, why should he come in the morning? Then\nshe felt, as she sat alone in her room, that she had done him a foul\ninjustice in that spur of the moment. It must be that she had done\nhim an injustice, or he would not have said that he would come. But\nif he could be generous, so could she. She had refused him when she\nbelieved herself to be the heiress of Llanfeare, and she certainly\nwould not accept him now.\n\nOn the next morning about eleven o'clock he came. She had become\naware that it was the intention of all the family that she should see\nhim alone, and she made no struggle against that intention. As such\nintention existed, the interview must of course take place, and as\nwell now as later. There was no confidence on the matter between\nherself and her stepmother,--no special confidence between even\nherself and her half-sisters. But she was aware that they all\nsupposed that Mr Owen was to come there on that morning for the sake\nof renewing his offer to her. It was soon done when he had come.\n\n\"Isabel,\" he said, \"I have brought with me that letter which you\nwrote to me. Will you take it back again?\" And he held it out in his\nhand.\n\n\"Nay; why should I take back my own letter?\" she answered, smiling.\n\n\"Because I hope--I do not say I trust--but I hope that I may receive\nan altered answer.\"\n\n\"Why should you hope so?\" she asked, foolishly enough.\n\n\"Because I love you so dearly. Let me say something very plainly. If\nit be a long story, forgive me because of its importance to myself. I\ndid think that you were--well, inclined to like me.\"\n\n\"Like you! I always liked you. I do like you.\"\n\n\"I hoped more. Perhaps I thought more. Nay, Isabel, do not interrupt\nme. When they told me that you were to be your uncle's heir, I knew\nthat you ought not to marry me.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Well, I knew that it should not be so. I knew that your uncle would\nthink so.\"\n\n\"Yes, he thought so.\"\n\n\"I knew that he would, and I accepted your answer as conveying his\ndecision. I had not intended to ask the heiress of Llanfeare to be my\nwife.\"\n\n\"Why not? Why not?\"\n\n\"I had not intended to ask the heiress of Llanfeare to by my wife,\"\nhe said, repeating the words. \"I learned last night that it was not\nto be so.\"\n\n\"No; it is not to be so.\"\n\n\"Then why should not Isabel Brodrick be the wife of William Owen,\nif she likes him,--if only she can bring herself to like him well\nenough?\"\n\nShe could not say that she did not like him well enough. She could\nnot force herself to tell such a lie! And yet there was her settled\npurpose still strong in her mind. Having refused him when she\nbelieved herself to be rich, she could not bring herself to take him\nnow that she was poor. She only shook her head mournfully.\n\n\"You cannot like me well enough for that?\"\n\n\"It must not be so.\"\n\n\"Must not? Why must not?\"\n\n\"It cannot be so.\"\n\n\"Then, Isabel, you must say that you do not love me.\"\n\n\"I need say nothing, Mr Owen.\" Again she smiled as she spoke to him.\n\"It is enough for me to say that it cannot be so. If I ask you not to\npress me further, I am sure that you will not do so.\"\n\n\"I shall press you further,\" he said, as he left her; \"but I will\nleave you a week to think of it.\"\n\nShe took the week to think of it, and from day to day her mind would\nchange as she thought of it. Why should she not marry him, if thus\nthey might both be happy? Why should she cling to a resolution made\nby her when she was in error as to the truth? She knew now, she was\nnow quite certain, that when he had first come to her he had known\nnothing of her promised inheritance. He had come then simply because\nhe loved her, and for that reason, and for that reason only, he had\nnow come again. And yet--and yet, there was her resolution! And there\nwas the ground on which she had founded it! Though he might not\nremember it now, would he not remember hereafter that she had refused\nhim when she was rich and accepted him when she was poor? Where then\nwould be her martyrdom, where her glory, where her pride? Were she to\ndo so, she would only do as would any other girl. Though she would\nnot have been mean, she would seem to have been mean, and would so\nseem to his eyes. When the week was over she had told herself that\nshe must be true to her resolution.\n\nThere had been something said about him in the family, but very\nlittle. The stepmother was indeed afraid of Isabel, though she had\nendeavoured to conquer her own fear of using authority; and her\nhalf-sisters, though they loved her, held her in awe. There was so\nlittle that was weak about her, so little that was self-indulgent, so\nlittle that was like the other girls around them! It was known that\nMr Owen was to come again on a certain day at a certain hour, and it\nwas known also for what purpose he was to come; but no one had dared\nto ask a direct question as to the result of his coming.\n\nHe came, and on this occasion her firmness almost deserted her. When\nhe entered the room he seemed to her to be bigger than before, and\nmore like her master. As the idea that he was so fell upon her, she\nbecame aware that she loved him better than ever. She began to know\nthat with such a look as he now wore he would be sure to conquer.\nShe did not tell herself that she would yield, but thoughts flitted\nacross her as to what might be the best manner of yielding.\n\n\"Isabel,\" he said, taking her by the hand, \"Isabel, I have come\nagain, as I told you that I would.\"\n\nShe could not take her hand from him, nor could she say a word to him\nin her accustomed manner. As he looked down upon her, she felt that\nshe had already yielded, when suddenly the door was opened, and one\nof the girls hurried into the room.\n\n\"Isabel,\" said her sister, \"here is a telegram for you, just come\nfrom Carmarthen.\"\n\nOf course she opened it instantly with perturbed haste and quivering\nfingers. The telegram was as follows:--\"Your uncle is very ill, very\nill indeed, and wishes you to come back quite immediately.\" The\ntelegram was not from her Cousin Henry, but from the doctor.\n\nThere was no time then either for giving love or for refusing it.\nThe paper was handed to her lover to read, and then she rushed out\nof the room as though the train which was to carry her would start\ninstantly.\n\n\"You will let me write to you by-and-by?\" said Mr Owen as she left\nhim; but she made no answer to him as she rushed out of the room;\nnor would she make any answer to any of the others as they expressed\neither hope or consolation. When was the next train? When should\nshe reach Carmarthen? When would she once more be at the old man's\nbedside? In the course of the afternoon she did leave Hereford, and\nat about ten o'clock that night she was at Carmarthen. Some one\nconcerned had looked into this matter of the trains, and there at the\nstation was a fly ready to take her to Llanfeare. Before eleven her\nuncle's hand was in hers, as she stood by his bedside.\n\nHer Cousin Henry was in the room, and so was the housekeeper who had\nbeen with him constantly almost ever since she had left him. She had\nseen at once by the manner of the old servants as she entered the\nhouse, from the woeful face of the butler, and from the presence of\nthe cook, who had lived in the family for the last twenty years, that\nsomething terrible was expected. It was not thus that she would have\nbeen received had not the danger been imminent.\n\n\"Dr Powell says, Miss Isabel, that you are to be told that he will be\nhere quite early in the morning.\"\n\nThis coming from the cook, told her that her uncle was expected to\nlive that night, but that no more was expected.\n\n\"Uncle Indefer,\" she said, \"how is it with you? Uncle Indefer, speak\nto me!\" He moved his head a little upon the pillow; he turned his\nface somewhat towards hers; there was some slight return to the grasp\nof her hand; there was a gleam of loving brightness left in his eye;\nbut he could not then speak a word. When, after an hour, she left\nhis room for a few minutes to get rid of her travelling clothes,\nand to prepare herself for watching by him through the night, the\nhousekeeper, whom Isabel had known ever since she had been at\nLlanfeare, declared that in her opinion her uncle would never speak\nagain.\n\n\"The doctor, Miss Isabel, thought so, when he left us.\"\n\nShe hurried down, and at once occupied the place which the old woman\nhad filled for the last three days and nights. Before long she had\nbanished the woman, so that to her might belong the luxury of doing\nanything, if aught could be done. That her cousin should be there\nwas altogether unnecessary. If the old man could know any one at his\ndeathbed, he certainly would not wish to see the heir whom he had\nchosen.\n\n\"You must go--you must indeed,\" said Isabel.\n\nThen the cousin went, and so at last, with some persuasion, did the\nhousekeeper.\n\nShe sat there hour after hour, with her hand lying gently upon his.\nWhen she would move it for a moment, though it was to moisten his\nlips, he would give some sign of impatience. For hours he lay in that\nway, till the early dawn of the summer morning broke into the room\nthrough the chink of the shutters. Then there came from him some\nsign of a stronger life, and at last, with a low muttered voice,\nindistinct, but not so indistinct but that the sounds were caught, he\nwhispered a word or two.\n\n\"It is all right. It is done.\"\n\nSoon afterwards she rang the bell violently, and when the nurse\nentered the room she declared that her old master was no more. When\nthe doctor arrived at seven, having ridden out from Carmarthen, there\nwas nothing for him further to do but to give a certificate as to the\nmanner of death of Indefer Jones, Esq., late of Llanfeare, in the\ncounty of Carmarthen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nPreparing for the Funeral\n\n\nIsabel, when she was left alone, felt that a terrible weight of\nduty was imposed on her. She seemed to be immediately encompassed\nby a double world of circumstances. There was that world of grief\nwhich was so natural, but which would yet be easy, could she only\nbe allowed to sit down and weep. But it was explained to her that\nuntil after the funeral, and till the will should have been read,\neverything about Llanfeare must be done by her and in obedience to\nher orders. This necessity of action,--of action which in her present\ncondition of mind did not seem clear to her,--was not at all easy.\n\nThe doctor was good to her, and gave her some instruction before he\nleft her. \"Shall I give the keys to my cousin?\" she said to him. But\neven as she said this there was the doubt on her mind what those last\nwords of her uncle had been intended to mean. Though her grief was\nvery bitter, though her sorrow was quite sincere, she could not keep\nherself from thinking of those words. It was not that she was anxious\nto get the estate for herself. It was hardly in that way that the\nmatter in these moments presented itself to her. Did the meaning of\nthose words impose on her any duty? Would it be right that she should\nspeak of them, or be silent? Ought she to suppose that they had any\nmeaning, and if so, that they referred to the will?\n\n\"I think that you should keep the keys till after the will has been\nread,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Even though he should ask for them?\"\n\n\"Even though he should ask for them,\" said the doctor. \"He will not\npress such a request if you tell him that I say it ought to be so. If\nthere be any difficulty, send for Mr Apjohn.\"\n\nMr Apjohn was the lawyer; but there had been quite lately some\ndisagreement between her uncle and Mr Apjohn, and this advice was not\npalatable to her.\n\n\"But,\" continued Dr Powell, \"you will not find any difficulty of that\nkind. The funeral had better be on Monday. And the will, I suppose,\ncan be read afterwards. Mr Apjohn will come out and read it. There\ncan be no difficulty about that. I know that Mr Apjohn's feelings are\nof the kindest towards your uncle and yourself.\"\n\nMr Apjohn had taken upon himself to \"scold\" her uncle because of the\naltered will,--the will that had been altered in favour of Cousin\nHenry. So much the old man had said to Isabel himself. \"If I think\nit proper, he has no right to scold me,\" the old man had said. The\n\"scolding\" had probably been in the guise of that advice which a\nlawyer so often feels himself justified in giving.\n\nIsabel thought that she had better keep those words to herself, at\nany rate for the present. She almost resolved that she would keep\nthose words altogether to herself, unless other facts should come out\nwhich would explain their meaning and testify to their truths. She\nwould say nothing of them in a way that would seem to imply that she\nhad been led by them to conceive that she expected the property. She\ndid certainly think that they alluded to the property. \"It is all\nright. It is done.\" When her uncle had uttered these words, using the\nlast effort of his mortal strength for the purpose, he no doubt was\nthinking of the property. He had meant to imply that he had done\nsomething to make his last decision \"right\" in her favour. She was,\nshe thought, sure of so much. But then she bore in mind the condition\nof the old man's failing mind,--those wandering thoughts which would\nso naturally endeavour to fix themselves upon her and upon the\nproperty in combination with each other. How probable was it that he\nwould dream of something that he would fain do, and then dream that\nhe had done it! And she knew, too, as well as the lawyer would know\nhimself, that the words would go for nothing, though they had been\nspoken before a dozen witnesses. If a later will was there, the later\nwill would speak for itself. If no later will was there, the words\nwere empty breath.\n\nBut above all was she anxious that no one should think that she was\ndesirous of the property,--that no one should suppose that she would\nbe hurt by not having it. She was not desirous, and was not hurt. The\nmatter was so important, and had so seriously burdened her uncle's\nmind, that she could not but feel the weight herself; but as to\nher own desires, they were limited to a wish that her uncle's will,\nwhatever it might be, should be carried out. Not to have Llanfeare,\nnot to have even a shilling from her uncle's estate, would hurt her\nbut little,--would hurt her heart not at all. But to know that it\nwas thought by others that she was disappointed,--that would be a\ngrievous burden to her! Therefore she spoke to Dr Powell, and even to\nher cousin, as though the estate were doubtless now the property of\nthe latter.\n\nHenry Jones at this time,--during the days immediately following his\nuncle's death,--seemed to be so much awe-struck by his position, as\nto be incapable of action. To his Cousin Isabel he was almost servile\nin his obedience. With bated breath he did suggest that the keys\nshould be surrendered to him, making his proposition simply on the\nground that she would thus be saved from trouble; but when she told\nhim that it was her duty to keep them till after the funeral, and\nthat it would be her duty to act as mistress in the house till after\nthat ceremony, he was cringing in his compliance.\n\n\"Whatever you think best, Isabel, shall be done. I would not\ninterfere for a moment.\"\n\nThen some time afterwards, on the following day, he assured her that\nwhatever might be the nature of the will, she was to regard Llanfeare\nas her home as long as it would suit her to remain there.\n\n\"I shall go back to papa very soon,\" she had said, \"as soon, indeed,\nas I can have my things packed up after the funeral. I have already\nwritten to papa to say so.\"\n\n\"Everything shall be just as you please,\" he replied; \"only, pray,\nbelieve that if I can do anything for your accommodation it shall be\ndone.\"\n\nTo this she made some formal answer of courtesy, not, it may be\nfeared, very graciously. She did not believe in his civility; she\ndid not think he was kind to her in heart, and she could not bring\nherself to make her manner false to her feelings. After that, during\nthe days that remained before the funeral, very little was said\nbetween them. Her dislike to him grew in bitterness, though she\nfailed to explain even to herself the cause of her dislike. She did\nknow that her uncle had been in truth as little disposed to love him\nas herself, and that knowledge seemed to justify her. Those last\nwords had assured her at any rate of that, and though she was quite\nsure of her own conscience in regard to Llanfeare, though she was\ncertain that she did not covet the possession of the domain, still\nshe was unhappy to think that it should become his. If only for the\ntenants' sake and the servants, and the old house itself, there were\na thousand pities in that. And then the belief would intrude itself\nupon her that her uncle in the last expression of his wishes had not\nintended his nephew to be his heir.\n\nThen, in these days reports reached her which seemed to confirm her\nown belief. It had not been the habit of her life to talk intimately\nwith the servants, even though at Llanfeare there had been no other\nwoman with whom she could talk intimately. There had been about her\na sense of personal dignity which had made such freedom distasteful\nto herself, and had repressed it in them. But now the housekeeper\nhad come to her with a story to which Isabel had found it impossible\nnot to listen. It was reported about the place that the Squire had\ncertainly executed another will a few days after Isabel had left\nLlanfeare.\n\n\"If so,\" said Isabel sternly, \"it will be found when Mr Apjohn comes\nto open the papers.\"\n\nBut the housekeeper did not seem satisfied with this. Though she\nbelieved that some document had been written, Mr Apjohn had not\nbeen sent for, as had always been done on former similar occasions.\nThe making of the Squire's will had been a thing always known and\nwell understood at Llanfeare. Mr Apjohn had been sent for on such\noccasions, and had returned after a day or two, accompanied by two\nclerks. It was quite understood that the clerks were there to witness\nthe will. The old butler, who would bring in the sherry and biscuits\nafter the operation, was well acquainted with all the testamentary\ncircumstances of the occasions. Nothing of that kind had occurred\nnow; but old Joseph Cantor, who had been a tenant on the property for\nthe last thirty years, and his son, Joseph Cantor the younger, had\nbeen called in, and it was supposed that they had performed the duty\nof witnessing the document. The housekeeper seemed to think that\nthey, when interrogated, had declined to give any information on the\nsubject. She herself had not seen them, but she had seen others of\nthe tenants, and she was certain, she said, that Llanfeare generally\nbelieved that the old Squire had executed a will during the absence\nof his niece.\n\nIn answer to all this Isabel simply said that if a new will, which\nshould turn out to be the real will, had actually been made, it would\nbe found among her uncle's papers. She knew well the manner in which\nthose other wills had been tied and deposited in one of the drawers\nof her uncle's tables. She had been invited to read them all, and had\nunderstood from a thousand assurances that he had wished that nothing\nshould be kept secret from her. The key of the very drawer was at\nthis moment in her possession. There was nothing to hinder her from\nsearching, should she wish to search. But she never touched the\ndrawer. The key which locked it she placed in an envelope, and put\nit apart under another lock and key. Though she listened, though she\ncould not but listen, to the old woman's narrative, yet she rebuked\nthe narrator. \"There should be no talking about such things,\" she\nsaid. \"It had been,\" she said, \"her uncle's intention to make his\nnephew the owner of Llanfeare, and she believed that he had done so.\nIt was better that there should be no conversation on the matter\nuntil the will had been read.\"\n\nDuring these days she did not go beyond the precincts of the garden,\nand was careful not to encounter any of the tenants, even when they\ncalled at the house. Mr Apjohn she did not see, nor Dr Powell again,\ntill the day of the funeral. The lawyer had written to her more\nthan once, and had explained to her exactly the manner in which he\nintended to proceed. He, with Dr Powell, would be at the house at\neleven o'clock; the funeral would be over at half-past twelve; they\nwould lunch at one, and immediately afterwards the will should be\n\"looked for\" and read. The words \"looked for\" were underscored in his\nletter, but no special explanation of the underscoring was given. He\nwent on to say that the tenants would, as a matter of course, attend\nthe funeral, and that he had taken upon himself to invite some few\nof those who had known the Squire most intimately, to be present at\nthe reading of the will. These he named, and among them were Joseph\nCantor the elder, and Joseph Cantor the younger. It immediately\noccurred to Isabel that the son was not himself a tenant, and that\nno one else who was not a tenant was included in the list. From this\nshe was sure that Mr Apjohn had heard the story which the housekeeper\nhad told her. During these days there was little or no intercourse\nbetween Isabel and her cousin. At dinner they met, but only at\ndinner, and even then almost nothing was said between them. What he\ndid with himself during the day she did not even know. At Llanfeare\nthere was a so-called book-room, a small apartment, placed between\nthe drawing-room and the parlour, in which were kept the few hundred\nvolumes which constituted the library of Llanfeare. It had not been\nmuch used by the late Squire except that from time to time he would\nenter it for the sake of taking down with his own hands some volume\nof sermons from the shelves. He himself had for years been accustomed\nto sit in the parlour, in which he ate his meals, and had hated the\nceremony of moving even into the drawing-room. Isabel herself had a\nsitting-room of her own upstairs, and she, too, had never used the\nbook-room. But here Cousin Henry had now placed himself, and here he\nremained through the whole day, though it was not believed of him\nthat he was given to much reading. For his breakfast and his supper\nhe went to the parlour alone. At dinner time Isabel came down. But\nthrough all the long hours of the day he remained among the books,\nnever once leaving the house till the moment came for receiving Mr\nApjohn and Dr Powell before the funeral. The housekeeper would say\nlittle words about him, wondering what he was doing in the book-room.\nTo this Isabel would apparently pay no attention, simply remarking\nthat it was natural that at such a time he should remain in\nseclusion.\n\n\"But he does get so very pale, Miss Isabel,\" said the housekeeper.\n\"He wasn't white, not like that when he come first to Llanfeare.\" To\nthis Isabel made no reply; but she, too, had remarked how wan, how\npallid, and how spiritless he had become.\n\nOn the Monday morning, when the men upstairs were at work on their\nghastly duty, before the coming of the doctor and the lawyer, she\nwent down to him, to tell him something of the programme for the day.\nHitherto he had simply been informed that on that morning the body\nwould be buried under the walls of the old parish church, and that\nafter the funeral the will would be read. Entering the room somewhat\nsuddenly she found him seated, vacant, in a chair, with an open book\nindeed on the table near him, but so placed that she was sure that he\nhad not been occupied with it. There he was, looking apparently at\nthe bookshelves, and when she entered the room he jumped up to greet\nher with an air of evident surprise.\n\n\"Mr Apjohn and Dr Powell will be here at eleven,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, ah; yes,\" he replied.\n\n\"I thought I would tell you, that you might be ready.\"\n\n\"Yes; that is very kind. But I am ready. The men came in just now,\nand put the band on my hat, and laid my gloves there. You will not\ngo, of course?\"\n\n\"Yes; I shall follow the body. I do not see why I should not go as\nwell as you. A woman may be strong enough at any rate for that. Then\nthey will come back to lunch.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed; I did not know that there would be a lunch.\"\n\n\"Yes; Dr Powell says that it will be proper. I shall not be there,\nbut you, of course, will be present to take the head of the table.\"\n\n\"If you wish it.\"\n\n\"Of course; it would be proper. There must be some one to seem at any\nrate to entertain them. When that is over Mr Apjohn will find the\nwill, and will read it. Richard will lay the lunch here, so that you\nmay go at once into the parlour, where the will will be read. They\ntell me that I am to be there. I shall do as they bid me, though\nit will be a sore trouble to me. Dr Powell will be there, and some\nof the tenants. Mr Apjohn has thought it right to ask them, and\ntherefore I tell you. Those who will be present are as follows:--John\nGriffith, of Coed; William Griffith, who has the home farm; Mr\nMortimer Green, of Kidwelly; Samuel Jones, of Llanfeare Grange; and\nthe two Cantors, Joseph Cantor the father, and Joseph the son. I\ndon't know whether you know them by appearance as yet.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I know them.\" His face was almost sepulchral as he\nanswered her, and as she looked at him she perceived that a slight\nquiver came upon his lips as she pronounced with peculiar clearness\nthe two last names on the list.\n\n\"I thought it best to tell you all this,\" she added. \"If I find it\npossible, I shall go to Hereford on Wednesday. Most of my things are\nalready packed. It may be that something may occur to stop me, but if\nit is possible I shall go on Wednesday.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nMr Apjohn's Explanation\n\n\nThe reader need not be detained with any elaborate account of the\nfuneral. Every tenant and every labourer about the place was there;\nas also were many of the people from Carmarthen. Llanfeare Church,\nwhich stands on a point of a little river just as it runs into a\ncreek of the sea, is not more than four miles distant from the town;\nbut such was the respect in which the old squire was held that a\nlarge crowd was present as the body was lowered into the vault. Then\nthe lunch followed, just as Isabel had said. There was Cousin Henry,\nand there were the doctor and the lawyer, and there were the tenants\nwho had been specially honoured by invitation, and there was Joseph\nCantor the younger. The viands were eaten freely, though the occasion\nwas not a happy one. Appetites are good even amidst grief, and the\nfarmers of Llanfeare took their victuals and their wine in funereal\nsilence, but not without enjoyment. Mr Apjohn and Dr Powell also were\nhungry, and being accustomed, perhaps, to such entertainments, did\nnot allow the good things prepared to go waste. But Cousin Henry,\nthough he made an attempt, could not swallow a morsel. He took a\nglass of wine, and then a second, helping himself from the bottle as\nit stood near at hand; but he ate nothing, and spoke hardly a word.\nAt first he made some attempt, but his voice seemed to fail him. Not\none of the farmers addressed a syllable to him. He had before the\nfuneral taken each of them by the hand, but even then they had not\nspoken to him. They were rough of manner, little able to conceal\ntheir feelings; and he understood well from their bearing that he was\nodious to them. Now as he sat at table with them, he determined that\nas soon as this matter should be settled he would take himself away\nfrom Llanfeare, even though Llanfeare should belong to him. While\nthey were at the table both the lawyer and the doctor said a word to\nhim, making a struggle to be courteous, but after the first struggle\nthe attempt ceased also with them. The silence of the man, and even\nthe pallor of his face might be supposed to be excused by the nature\nof the occasion.\n\n\"Now,\" said Mr Apjohn, rising from the table when the eating and\ndrinking had ceased, \"I think we might as well go into the next room.\nMiss Brodrick, who has consented to be present, will probably be\nwaiting for us.\"\n\nThey passed through the hall into the parlour in a long string, Mr\nApjohn leading the way, followed by Cousin Henry. There they found\nIsabel sitting with the housekeeper beside her. She shook hands in\nsilence with the attorney, the doctor, and all the tenants, and then,\nas she took her seat, she spoke a word to Mr Apjohn. \"As I have felt\nit hard to be alone, I have asked Mrs Griffith to remain with me. I\nhope it is not improper?\"\n\n\"There can be no reason on earth,\" said Mr Apjohn, \"why Mrs Griffith\nshould not hear the will of her master, who respected her so\nthoroughly.\" Mrs Griffith bobbed a curtsey in return for this\ncivility, and then sat down, intently interested in the coming\nceremony.\n\nMr Apjohn took from his pocket the envelope containing the key, and,\nopening the little packet very slowly, very slowly opened the drawer,\nand took out from it a bundle of papers tied with red tape. This he\nundid, and then, sitting with the bundle loosened before him, he\nexamined the document lying at the top. Then, slowly spreading them\nout, as though pausing over every operation with premeditated delay,\nhe held in his hand that which he had at first taken; but he was in\ntruth thinking of the words which he would have to use at the present\nmoment. He had expected, but had expected with some doubt, that\nanother document would have been found there. Close at his right hand\nsat Dr Powell. Round the room, in distant chairs, were ranged the\nsix farmers, each with his hat in hand between his knees. On a sofa\nopposite were Isabel and the housekeeper. Cousin Henry sat alone, not\nvery far from the end of the sofa, almost in the middle of the room.\nAs the operation went on, one of his hands quivered so much that he\nendeavoured to hold it with the other to keep it from shaking. It was\nimpossible that any one there should not observe his trepidation and\ntoo evident discomfort.\n\nThe document lying at the top of the bundle was opened out very\nslowly by the attorney, who smoothed it down with his hand\npreparatory to reading it. Then he looked at the date to assure\nhimself that it was the last will which he himself had drawn. He knew\nit well, and was cognizant with its every legal quiddity. He could\njudiciously have explained every clause of it without reading a word,\nand might probably have to do so before the occasion was over; but\nhe delayed, looking down upon it and still smoothing it, evidently\ntaking another minute or two to collect his thoughts. This will\nnow under his hand was very objectionable to him, having been made\naltogether in opposition to his own advice, and having thus created\nthat \"scolding\" of which the Squire had complained to Isabel. This\nwill bequeathed the whole of the property to Cousin Henry. It did\nalso affect to leave a certain sum of money to Isabel, but the sum\nof money had been left simply as a sum of money, and not as a charge\non the property. Now, within the last few days, Mr Apjohn had learnt\nthat there were no funds remaining for the payment of such a legacy.\nThe will, therefore, was to him thoroughly distasteful. Should that\nwill in truth be found to be the last will and testament of the old\nSquire, then it would be his duty to declare that the estate and\neverything upon it belonged to Cousin Henry, and that there would be,\nas he feared, no source from which any considerable part of the money\nnominally left to Miss Brodrick could be defrayed. To his thinking\nnothing could be more cruel, nothing more unjust, than this.\n\nHe had heard tidings which would make it his duty to question the\nauthenticity of this will which was now under his hand; and now had\ncome the moment in which he must explain all this.\n\n\"The document which I hold here,\" he said, \"purports to be the last\nwill of our old friend. Every will does that as a matter of course.\nBut then there may always be another and a later will.\" Here he\npaused, and looked round the room at the faces of the farmers.\n\n\"So there be,\" said Joseph Cantor the younger.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Joe, till you be asked,\" said the father.\n\nAt this little interruption all the other farmers turned their hats\nin their hands. Cousin Henry gazed round at them, but said never a\nword. The lawyer looked into the heir's face, and saw the great beads\nof sweat standing on his brow.\n\n\"You hear what young Mr Cantor has said,\" continued the lawyer. \"I\nam glad that he interrupted me, because it will make my task easier.\"\n\n\"There now, feyther!\" said the young man triumphantly.\n\n\"You hold your tongue, Joe, till you be asked, or I'll lend ye a\ncuff.\"\n\n\"Now I must explain,\" continued Mr Apjohn, \"what passed between me\nand my dear old friend when I received instructions from him in this\nroom as to this document which is now before me. You will excuse me,\nMr Jones,\"--this he said addressing himself especially to Cousin\nHenry--\"if I say that I did not like this new purpose on the Squire's\npart. He was proposing an altogether new arrangement as to the\ndisposition of his property; and though there could be no doubt, not\na shadow of doubt, as to the sufficiency of his mental powers for\nthe object in view, still I did not think it well that an old man in\nfeeble health should change a purpose to which he had come in his\nmaturer years, after very long deliberation, and on a matter of such\nvital moment. I expressed my opinion strongly, and he explained his\nreasons. He told me that he thought it right to keep the property in\nthe direct line of his family. I endeavoured to explain to him that\nthis might be sufficiently done though the property were left to a\nlady, if the lady were required to take the name, and to confer the\nname on her husband, should she afterwards marry. You will probably\nall understand the circumstances.\"\n\n\"We understand them all,\" said John Griffith, of Coed, who was\nsupposed to be the tenant of most importance on the property.\n\n\"Well, then, I urged my ideas perhaps too strongly. I am bound to say\nthat I felt them very strongly. Mr Indefer Jones remarked that it was\nnot my business to lecture him on a matter in which his conscience\nwas concerned. In this he was undoubtedly right; but still I thought\nI had done no more than my duty, and could only be sorry that he was\nangry with me. I can assure you that I never for a moment entertained\na feeling of anger against him. He was altogether in his right, and\nwas actuated simply by a sense of duty.\"\n\n\"We be quite sure of that,\" said Samuel Jones, from The Grange, an\nold farmer, who was supposed to be a far-away cousin of the family.\n\n\"I have said all this,\" continued the lawyer, \"to explain why it\nmight be probable that Mr Jones should not have sent for me, if, in\nhis last days, he felt himself called on by duty to alter yet once\nagain the decision to which he had come. You can understand that if\nhe determined in his illness to make yet another will--\"\n\n\"Which he did,\" said the younger Cantor, interrupting him.\n\n\"Exactly; we will come to that directly.\"\n\n\"Joe, ye shall be made to sit out in the kitchen; ye shall,\" said\nCantor the father.\n\n\"You can understand, I say, that he might not like to see me again\nupon the subject. In such case he would have come back to the opinion\nwhich I had advocated; and, though no man in his strong health would\nhave been more ready to acknowledge an error than Indefer Jones,\nof Llanfeare, we all know that with failing strength comes failing\ncourage. I think that it must have been so with him, and that for\nthis reason he did not avail himself of my services. If there be such\nanother will--\"\n\n\"There be!\" said the irrepressible Joe Cantor the younger. Upon this\nhis father only looked at him. \"Our names is to it,\" continued Joe.\n\n\"We cannot say that for certain, Mr Cantor,\" said the lawyer. \"The\nold Squire may have made another will, as you say, and may have\ndestroyed it. We must have the will before we can use it. If he left\nsuch a will, it will be found among his papers. I have turned over\nnothing as yet; but as it was here in this drawer and tied in this\nbundle that Mr Jones was accustomed to keep his will,--as the last\nwill which I made is here, as I expected to find it, together with\nthose which he had made before and which he seems never to have\nwished to destroy, I have had to explain all this to you. It is, I\nsuppose, true, Mr Cantor, that you and your son were called upon by\nthe Squire to witness his signature to a document which he purported\nto be a will on Monday the 15th of July?\"\n\nThen Joseph Cantor the father told all the circumstances as they\nhad occurred. When Mr Henry Jones had been about a fortnight at\nLlanfeare, and when Miss Isabel had been gone a week, he, Cantor, had\nhappened to come up to see the Squire, as it was his custom to do at\nleast once a week. Then the Squire had told him that his services and\nthose also of his son were needed for the witnessing of a deed. Mr\nJones had gone on to explain that this deed was to be his last will.\nThe old farmer, it seemed, had suggested to his landlord that Mr\nApjohn should be employed. The Squire then declared that this would\nbe unnecessary; that he himself had copied a former will exactly, and\ncompared it word for word, and reproduced it with no other alteration\nthan that of the date. All that was wanted would be his signature,\nefficiently witnessed by two persons who should both be present\ntogether with the testator. Then the document had been signed by\nthe Squire, and after that by the farmer and his son. It had been\nwritten, said Joseph Cantor, not on long, broad paper such as that\nwhich had been used for the will now lying on the table before the\nlawyer, but on a sheet of square paper such as was now found in the\nSquire's desk. He, Cantor, had not read a word of what had there been\nset down, but he had been enabled to see that it was written in that\npeculiarly accurate and laborious handwriting which the Squire was\nknown to use, but not more frequently than he could help.\n\nThus the story was told,--at least, all that there was to tell as\nyet. The drawer was opened and ransacked, as were also the other\ndrawers belonging to the table. Then a regular search was made by the\nattorney, accompanied by the doctor, the butler, and the housemaid,\nand continued through the whole afternoon,--in vain. The farmers\nwere dismissed as soon as the explanation had been given as above\ndescribed. During the remainder of the day Cousin Henry occupied a\nchair in the parlour, looking on as the search was continued. He\noffered no help, which was natural enough; nor did he make any remark\nas to the work in hand, which was, perhaps, also natural. The matter\nwas to him one of such preponderating moment that he could hardly\nbe expected to speak of it. Was he to have Llanfeare and all that\nbelonged to it, or was he to have nothing? And then, though no\naccusation was made against him, though no one had insinuated that\nhe had been to blame in the matter, still there was apparent among\nthem all a strong feeling against him. Who had made away with this\nwill, as to the existence of which at one time there was no doubt? Of\ncourse the idea was present to his mind that they must think that he\nhad done so. In such circumstances it was not singular that he should\nsay nothing and do nothing.\n\nLate in the evening Mr Apjohn, just before he left the house, asked\nCousin Henry a question, and received an answer.\n\n\"Mrs Griffith tells me, Mr Jones, that you were closeted with your\nuncle for about an hour immediately after the Cantors had left him\non that Tuesday,--just after the signatures had been written. Was it\nso?\"\n\nAgain the drops of sweat came out and stood thick upon his forehead.\nBut this Mr Apjohn could understand without making an accusation\nagainst the man, even in his heart. The unexpressed suspicion was so\nheavy that a man might well sweat under the burden of it! He paused a\nmoment, and tried to look as though he were thinking. \"Yes,\" said he;\n\"I think I was with my uncle on that morning.\"\n\n\"And you knew that the Cantors had been with him?\"\n\n\"Not that I remember. I think I did know that somebody had been\nthere. Yes, I did know it. I had seen their hats in the hall.\"\n\n\"Did he say anything about them?\"\n\n\"Not that I remember.\"\n\n\"Of what was he talking? Can you tell me? I rather fancy that he did\nnot talk much to you.\"\n\n\"I think it was then that he told me the names of all the tenants.\nHe used to scold me because I did not understand the nature of their\nleases.\"\n\n\"Did he scold you then?\"\n\n\"I think so. He always scolded me. He did not like me. I used to\nthink that I would go away and leave him. I wish that I had never\ncome to Llanfeare. I do;--I do.\"\n\nThere seemed to be a touch of truth about this which almost softened\nMr Apjohn's heart to the poor wretch. \"Would you mind answering one\nmore question, Mr Jones?\" he said. \"Did he tell you that he had made\nanother will?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor that he intended to do so?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"He never spoke to you about another will,--a further will, that\nshould again bestow the estate on your cousin?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Cousin Henry, with the perspiration still on his brow.\n\nNow it seemed to Mr Apjohn certain that, had the old man made such a\nchange in his purpose, he would have informed his nephew of the fact.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nLooking for the Will\n\n\nThe search was carried on up to nine o'clock that evening, and then\nMr Apjohn returned to Carmarthen, explaining that he would send out\ntwo men to continue the work on the Tuesday, and that he would come\nout again on the Wednesday to read whatever might then be regarded\nas the old Squire's will,--the last prepared document if it could be\nfound, and the former one should the search have been unsuccessful.\n\"Of course,\" said he, in the presence of the two cousins, \"my reading\nthe document will give it no force. Of those found, the last in date\nwill be good--until one later be found. It will be well, however,\nthat some steps should be taken, and nothing can be done till\nthe will has been read.\" Then he took his leave and went back to\nCarmarthen.\n\nIsabel had not shown herself during the whole of the afternoon. When\nMr Apjohn's explanation had been given, and the search commenced, she\nretired and went to her own room. It was impossible for her to take a\npart in the work that was being done, and almost equally impossible\nfor her to remain without seeming to take too lively an interest\nin the proceeding. Every point of the affair was clear to her\nimagination. It could not now be doubted by her that her uncle,\ndoubly actuated by the presence of the man he disliked and the\nabsence of her whom he so dearly loved, had found himself driven to\nrevoke the decision to which he had been brought. As she put it to\nherself, his love had got the better of his conscience during the\nweakness of his latter days. It was a pity,--a pity that it should\nhave been so! It was to be regretted that there should have been no\none near him to comfort him in the misery which had produced such\na lamentable result. A will, she thought, should be the outcome\nof a man's strength, and not of his weakness. Having obeyed his\nconscience, he should have clung to his conscience. But all that\ncould not affect what had been done. It seemed to be certain to her\nthat this other will had been made and executed. Even though it\nshould have been irregularly executed so as to be null and void,\nstill it must for a time at least have had an existence. Where was it\nnow? Having these thoughts in her mind, it was impossible for her to\ngo about the house among those who were searching. It was impossible\nfor her to encounter the tremulous misery of her cousin. That he\nshould shiver and shake and be covered with beads of perspiration\nduring a period of such intense perturbation did not seem to her to\nbe unnatural. It was not his fault that he had not been endowed with\nespecial manliness. She disliked him in his cowardice almost more\nthan before; but she would not on that account allow herself to\nsuspect him of a crime.\n\nMr Apjohn, just before he went, had an interview with her in her own\nroom.\n\n\"I cannot go without a word,\" he said, \"but its only purport will be\nto tell you that I cannot as yet express any decided opinion in this\nmatter.\"\n\n\"Do not suppose, Mr Apjohn, that I am anxious for another will,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I am;--but that has nothing to do with it. That he did make a will,\nand have it witnessed by these two Cantors, is, I think, certain.\nThat he should afterwards have destroyed the will without telling the\nwitnesses, who would be sure hereafter to think and talk of what they\nhad done, seems to be most unlike the thoughtful consideration of\nyour uncle. But his weakness increased upon him very quickly just at\nthat time. Dr Powell thinks that he was certainly competent on that\nday to make a will, but he thinks also he may have destroyed it a day\nor two afterwards when his mind was hardly strong enough to enable\nhim to judge of what he was doing. If, at last, this new will shall\nnot be forthcoming, I think we must be bound to interpret the matter\nin that way. I tell you this before I go in order that it may assist\nyou perhaps a little in forming your own opinion.\" Then he went.\n\nIt was impossible but that she should bethink herself at that moment\nthat she knew more than either Dr Powell or Mr Apjohn. The last\nexpression of the old man's thoughts upon that or upon any matter had\nbeen made to herself. The last words that he had uttered had been\nwhispered into her ears; \"It is all right. It is done.\" Let the light\nof his failing intellect have been ever so dim, let his strength\nhave faded from him ever so completely, he would not have whispered\nthese words had he himself destroyed that last document. Mr Apjohn\nhad spoken of the opinion which she was to form, and she felt how\nimpossible to her it would be not to have an opinion in the matter.\nShe could not keep her mind vacant even if she would. Mr Apjohn had\nsaid that, if the will were not found, he should think that the\nSquire had in his weakness again changed his mind and destroyed it.\nShe was sure that this was not so. She, and she alone, had heard\nthose last words. Was it or was it not her duty to tell Mr Apjohn\nthat such words had been uttered? Had they referred to the interest\nof any one but herself, of course it would have been her duty. But\nnow,--now she doubted. She did not choose to seem even to put forth a\nclaim on her own account. And of what use would be any revelation as\nto the uttering of these words? They would be accepted in no court\nof law as evidence in one direction or another. Upon the whole, she\nthought she would keep her peace regarding them, even to Mr Apjohn.\nIf it was to be that her cousin should live there as squire and owner\nof Llanfeare, why should she seek to damage his character by calling\nin question the will under which he would inherit the property? Thus\nshe determined that she would speak of her uncle's last words to no\none.\n\nBut what must be her opinion as to the whole transaction? At the\npresent moment she felt herself bound to think that this missing\ndocument would be found. That to her seemed to be the only solution\nwhich would not be terrible to contemplate. That other solution,--of\nthe destruction of the will by her uncle's own hands,--she altogether\nrepudiated. If it were not found, then--! What then? Would it not\nthen be evident that some fraud was being perpetrated? And if so, by\nwhom? As these thoughts forced themselves upon her mind, she could\nnot but think of that pallid face, those shaking hands, and the great\ndrops of sweat which from time to time had forced themselves on\nto the man's brow. It was natural that he should suffer. It was\nnatural that he should be perturbed under the consciousness of the\nhostile feeling of all those around him. But yet there had hardly\nbeen occasion for all those signs of fear which she had found it\nimpossible not to notice as she had sat there in the parlour while Mr\nApjohn was explaining the circumstances of the two wills. Would an\ninnocent man have trembled like that because the circumstances around\nhim were difficult? Could anything but guilt have betrayed itself by\nsuch emotions? And then, had the will in truth been made away with\nby human hands, what other hands could have done it? Who else was\ninterested? Who else was there at Llanfeare not interested in the\npreservation of a will which would have left the property to her? She\ndid not begrudge him the estate. She had acknowledged the strength of\nthe reasons which had induced the Squire to name him as heir; but she\ndeclared to herself that, if that latter document were not found, a\ndeed of hideous darkness would have been perpetrated by him. With\nthese thoughts disturbing her breast she lay awake during the long\nhours of the night.\n\nWhen Mr Apjohn had taken his departure, and the servants had gone to\ntheir beds, the butler having barred and double-barred the door after\nhis usual manner, Cousin Henry still sat alone in the book-room.\nAfter answering those questions from Mr Apjohn, he had spoken to no\none, but still sat alone with a single candle burning on the table\nby his elbow. The butler had gone to him twice, asking him whether\nhe wanted anything, and suggesting to him that he had better go to\nhis bed. But the heir, if he was the heir, had only resented the\nintrusion, desiring that he might be left alone. Then he was left\nalone, and there he sat.\n\nHis mind at this moment was tormented grievously within him. There\nwas a something which he might do, and a something which he might not\ndo, if he could only make up his mind. \"Honesty is the best policy!\"\n\"Honesty is the best policy!\" He repeated the well-known words to\nhimself a thousand times, without, however, moving his lips or\nforming a sound. There he sat, thinking it all out, trying to think\nit out. There he sat, still trembling, still in an agony, for hour\nafter hour. At one time he had fully resolved to do that by which he\nwould have proved to himself his conviction that honesty is the best\npolicy, and then he sat doubting again--declaring to himself that\nhonesty itself did not require him to do this meditated deed. \"Let\nthem find it,\" he said to himself at last, aloud. \"Let them find it.\nIt is their business: not mine.\" But still he sat looking up at the\nrow of books opposite to him.\n\nWhen it was considerably after midnight, he got up from his chair and\nbegan to walk the room. As he did so, he wiped his brow continually\nas though he were hot with the exertion, but keeping his eye still\nfixed upon the books. He was urging himself, pressing upon himself\nthe expression of that honesty. Then at last he rushed at one of the\nshelves, and, picking out a volume of Jeremy Taylor's works, threw it\nupon the table. It was the volume on which the old Squire had been\nengaged when he read the last sermon which was to prepare him for a\nflight to a better world. He opened the book, and there between the\nleaves was the last will and testament which his uncle had executed.\n\nAt that moment he heard a step in the hall and a hand on the door,\nand as he did so with quick eager motion he hid the document under\nthe book.\n\n\"It is near two o'clock, Mr Henry,\" said the butler. \"What are you\ndoing up so late?\"\n\n\"I am only reading,\" said the heir.\n\n\"It is very late to be reading. You had better go to bed. He never\nliked people to be a-reading at these contrairy hours. He liked folk\nto be all a-bed.\"\n\nThe use of a dead man's authority, employed against him by one who\nwas, so to say, his own servant, struck even him as absurd and\nimproper. He felt that he must assert himself unless he meant to sink\nlower and lower in the estimation of all those around him. \"I shall\nstay just as late as I please,\" he said. \"Go away, and do not disturb\nme any more.\"\n\n\"His will ought to be obeyed, and he not twenty-four hours under the\nground,\" said the butler.\n\n\"I should have stayed up just as long as I had pleased even had he\nbeen here,\" said Cousin Henry. Then the man with a murmur took his\ndeparture and closed the door after him.\n\nFor some minutes Cousin Henry sat perfectly motionless, and then he\ngot up very softly, very silently, and tried the door. It was closed,\nand it was the only door leading into the room. And the windows\nwere barred with shutters. He looked round and satisfied himself\nthat certainly no other eye was there but his own. Then he took the\ndocument up from its hiding-place, placed it again exactly between\nthe leaves which had before enclosed it, and carefully restored the\nbook to its place on the shelf.\n\nHe had not hidden the will. He had not thus kept it away from\nthe eyes of all those concerned. He had opened no drawer. He had\nextracted nothing, had concealed nothing. He had merely carried the\nbook from his uncle's table where he had found it, and, in restoring\nit to its place on the shelves, had found the paper which it\ncontained. So he told himself now, and so he had told himself a\nthousand times. Was it his duty to produce the evidence of a gross\ninjustice against himself? Who could doubt the injustice who knew\nthat he had been summoned thither from London to take his place at\nLlanfeare as heir to the property? Would not the ill done against him\nbe much greater than any he would do were he to leave the paper there\nwhere he had chanced to find it?\n\nIn no moment had it seemed to him that he himself had sinned in the\nmatter, till Mr Apjohn had asked him whether his uncle had told him\nof this new will. Then he had lied. His uncle had told him of his\nintention before the will was executed, and had told him again,\nwhen the Cantors had gone, that the thing was done. The old man\nhad expressed a thousand regrets, but the young one had remained\nimpassive, sullen, crushed with a feeling of the injury done to him,\nbut still silent. He had not dared to remonstrate, and had found\nhimself unable to complain of the injustice.\n\nThere it was in his power. He was quite awake to the strength of his\nown position,--but also to its weakness. Should he resolve to leave\nthe document enclosed within the cover of the book, no one could\naccuse him of dishonesty. He had not placed it there. He had not\nhidden it. He had done nothing. The confusion occasioned by the\nabsence of the will would have been due to the carelessness of a\nworn-out old man who had reached the time of life in which he was\nunfit to execute such a deed. It seemed to him that all justice, all\nhonesty, all sense of right and wrong, would be best served by the\neverlasting concealment of such a document. Why should he tell of its\nhiding-place? Let them who wanted it search for it, and find it if\nthey could. Was he not doing much in the cause of honesty in that he\ndid not destroy it, as would be so easy for him?\n\nBut, if left there, would it not certainly be found? Though it should\nremain week after week, month after month,--even should it remain\nyear after year, would it not certainly be found at last, and brought\nout to prove that Llanfeare was not his own? Of what use to him would\nbe the property,--of what service;--how would it contribute to his\nhappiness or his welfare, knowing, as he would know, that a casual\naccident, almost sure to happen sooner or later, might rob him of it\nfor ever? His imagination was strong enough to depict the misery to\nhim which such a state of things would produce. How he would quiver\nwhen any stray visitor might enter the room! How terrified he would\nbe at the chance assiduity of a housemaid! How should he act if the\nreligious instincts of some future wife should teach her to follow\nout that reading which his uncle had cultivated?\n\nHe had more than once resolved that he would be mad were he to leave\nthe document where he found it. He must make it known to those who\nwere searching for it,--or he must destroy it. His common sense\ntold him that one alternative or the other must be chosen. He could\ncertainly destroy it, and no one would be the wiser. He could reduce\nit, in the solitude of his chamber, into almost impalpable ashes, and\nthen swallow them. He felt that, let suspicion come as it might into\nthe minds of men, let Apjohn, and Powell, and the farmers--let Isabel\nherself--think what they might, no one would dare to accuse him of\nsuch a deed. Let them accuse him as they might, there would be no\ntittle of evidence against him.\n\nBut he could not do it. The more he thought of it, the more he had to\nacknowledge that he was incapable of executing such a deed. To burn\nthe morsel of paper;--oh, how easy! But yet he knew that his hands\nwould refuse to employ themselves on such a work. He had already\ngiven it up in despair; and, having told himself that it was\nimpossible, had resolved to extricate the document and, calling\nIsabel up from her bed in the middle of the night, to hand it over to\nher at once. It would have been easy to say he had opened one book\nafter another, and it would, he thought, be a deed grand to do. Then\nhe had been interrupted, and insulted by the butler, and in his anger\nhe had determined that the paper should rest there yet another day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe Reading of the Will\n\n\nOn the whole of the next day the search was continued. In spite of\nhis late watches, Cousin Henry rose up early, not looking at anything\nthat was being done while the search was continued in other rooms,\nbut still sitting, as he had heretofore sat, among the books. The two\nmen whom Mr Apjohn had sent from his office, together with the butler\nand Mrs Griffith, began their work in the old man's bed-room, and\nthen carried it on in the parlour. When they came to the book-room,\nas being the next in turn, Cousin Henry took his hat and went out\ninto the garden. There, as he made short turns upon the gravel path,\nhe endeavoured to force himself away from the close vicinity of the\nwindow; but he could not do it. He could not go where he would have\nbeen unable to see what was being done. He feared,--he trembled in\nhis fear,--lest they should come upon the guilty volume. And yet he\nassured himself again and again that he wished that they might find\nit. Would it not in every way be better for him that they should find\nit? He could not bring himself to destroy it, and surely, sooner or\nlater, it would be found.\n\nEvery book was taken from its shelf, apparently with the object of\nlooking into the vacant spaces behind them. Through the window he\ncould see all that was done. As it happened, the compartment in which\nwas the fatal shelf,--on which was the fatal volume,--was the last\nthat they reached. No attempt was made to open the books one by one;\nbut then this volume, with so thick an enclosure to betray it, would\ncertainly open of itself. He himself had gone to the place so often\nthat certainly the enclosure would betray itself. Well, let it betray\nitself! No one could say that he had had guilty cognizance of its\nwhereabouts! But yet he knew that he would have been unable to speak,\nwould have gasped, and would surely have declared himself to be\nguilty by his awe-struck silence.\n\nThree by three the books came down, and then were replaced. And now\nthey were at the shelf! Why could he not go away? Why must he stand\nthere fixed at the window? He had done nothing,--nothing, nothing;\nand yet he stood there trembling, immovable, with the perspiration\nrunning off his face, unable to keep his eyes for a moment from what\nthey were doing! At last the very three came down, in the centre of\nwhich was the volume containing the will. There was a tree against\nwhich he leaned, unable to support himself, as he looked into the\nroom. The vacant place was searched, and then the three books were\nreplaced! No attempt was made to examine the volumes. The men who did\nthe work clearly did not know that these very volumes had been in\nconstant use with the old Squire. They were replaced, and then the\nsearch, as far as the room was concerned, was over. When they were\ngone, Cousin Henry returned again to the room, and there he remained\nduring the rest of the day. The search as it was carried on elsewhere\nhad no interest for him.\n\nWhatever harm might be done to others, whoever else might be injured,\ncertainly no one was ill-treated as he had been ill-treated. It was\nthus he thought of it. Even should the will never be found, how cruel\nwould be the injustice done to him! He had not asked to be made heir\nto the property! It was not his doing. He had been invited to come in\norder that he might be received as the heir, and since he had come,\nevery one about the place had misused him. The tenants had treated\nhim with disdain; the very servants had been insolent; his Cousin\nIsabel, when he had offered to share everything with her, had\ndeclared that he was hateful to her; and his uncle himself had heaped\ninsult upon injury, and had aggravated injustice with scorn.\n\n\"Yes; I had intended that you should be my heir, and have called you\nhither for that purpose. Now I find you to be so poor a creature that\nI have changed my mind.\" That in truth was what his uncle had said\nto him and had done for him. Who, after that, would expect him to go\nout of his way in search of special magnanimity? Let them find the\nwill if they wanted it! Even though he should resolve himself to have\nnothing to do with the property, even though he should repudiate any\nwill in his own favour, still he would not tell them where this will\nmight be found. Why should he help them in their difficulty?\n\nEvery carpet was taken up, every piece of furniture was moved, every\ntrunk and box in the house was examined, but it occurred to no one\nthat every book should be opened. It was still July, and the day was\nvery long. From six in the morning till nine at night they were at\nwork, and when the night came they declared that every spot about the\nplace had been searched.\n\n\"I think, Miss, that the old Squire did destroy it. He was a little\nwandering at last.\" It was thus that Mrs Griffith had expressed her\nopinion to Isabel.\n\nIsabel was sure that it was not so, but said nothing in reply.\n\nIf she could only get away from Llanfeare and have done with it, she\nwould be satisfied. Llanfeare had become odious to her and terrible!\nShe would get away, and wash her hands of it. And yet she was aware\nhow sad would be her condition. Mr Apjohn had already explained to\nher that the Squire had so managed his affairs as to have left no\nfunds from which could be paid the legacy which had nominally been\nleft to her. She had told her father when at Hereford that her\nuncle had taken such care of her that she would not become a burden\nupon him. Now it seemed that she would have to return home without\na shilling of her own. For one so utterly penniless to think of\nmarrying a man who had little but his moderate professional income\nwould, she felt, be mean as well as wrong. There must be an end to\neverything between her and Mr Owen. If her father could not support\nher, she must become a governess or, failing that, a housemaid. But\neven the poor-house would be better than Llanfeare, if Llanfeare were\nto be the property of Cousin Henry.\n\nMr Apjohn had told her that she could not now leave the place on the\nWednesday as she had intended. On the Wednesday he again came to\nLlanfeare, and then she saw him before he proceeded to his business.\nIt was his intention now to read the last will which had been found,\nand to explain to those who heard it that he proposed, as joint\nexecutor with Dr Powell, to act upon that as the last will;--but\nstill with a proviso that another will might possibly be forthcoming.\nThough he had in a measure quarrelled with the Squire over the making\nof that will, nevertheless, he had been appointed in it as the\nexecutor, such having been the case in the wills previously made. All\nthis he explained to her up in her room, assenting to her objection\nto be again present when the will should be read.\n\n\"I could not do it,\" she said; \"and of what use could it be, as I\nknow everything that is in it? It would be too painful.\"\n\nHe, remembering the futile legacy which it contained for herself, and\nthe necessity which would be incumbent upon him to explain that there\nwere no funds for paying it, did not again ask her to be present.\n\n\"I shall go to-morrow,\" she said.\n\nThen he asked her whether she could not remain until the beginning of\nnext week, urging objections to this final surrender of Llanfeare;\nbut she was not to be turned from her purpose. \"Llanfeare will have\nbeen surrendered,\" she said; \"the house will be his to turn me out of\nif he pleases.\"\n\n\"He would not do that.\"\n\n\"He shall not have the chance. I could not hide it from you if I\nwould. He and I do not love each other. Since he has been here I have\nkept away from him with disgust. He cannot but hate me, and I will\nnot be a guest in his house. Besides, what can I do?\"\n\n\"The will will not have been proved, you know.\"\n\n\"What difference will there be in that? It will be proved at once.\nOf course he will have the keys, and will be master of everything.\nThere are the keys.\" As she said this she handed over to him various\nbunches. \"You had better give them to him yourself when you have read\nthe will, so that I need have nothing to say to him. There are some\nbooks of mine which my uncle gave me. Mrs Griffith will pack them,\nand send them to me at Hereford,--unless he objects. Everything else\nbelonging to me I can take with me. Perhaps you will tell them to\nsend a fly out for me in time for the early train.\"\n\nAnd so it was settled.\n\nThen that will was read,--that will which we know not to have been\nthe last will,--in the presence of Cousin Henry, of Dr Powell, who\nhad again come out with Mr Apjohn, and of the farmers, who were\ncollected as before.\n\nIt was a long, tedious document, in which the testator set forth at\nlength his reasons for the disposition which he made of the property.\nHaving much considered the matter, he had thought the estate should\ndescend to the male heir, even in default of a regular deed of\nentail. Therefore, although his love for his dearest niece, Isabel\nBrodrick, was undiminished, and his confidence in her as perfect as\never, still he had thought it right to leave the old family property\nto his nephew, Henry Jones. Then, with all due circumstances of\ndescription, the legacy was made in favour of his nephew. There were\nother legacies; a small sum of money to Mr Apjohn himself, for the\ntrouble imposed upon him as executor, a year's wages to each of his\nservants and other matters of the kind. There was also left to Isabel\nthat sum of four thousand pounds of which mention has been made. When\nthe lawyer had completed the reading of the document, he declared\nthat to the best of his knowledge no such money was in existence. The\ntestator had no doubt thought that legacies so made would be paid out\nof the property, whereas the property could be made subject to no\nsuch demand unless it had, by proper instrument to that effect, been\ncharged with the amount.\n\n\"But,\" he said, \"Mr Henry Jones, when he comes into possession of the\nestate, will probably feel himself called upon to set that matter\nright, and to carry out his uncle's wishes.\"\n\nUpon this Cousin Henry, who had not as yet spoken a word throughout\nthe ceremony, was profuse in his promises. Should the estate become\nhis, he would certainly see that his uncle's wishes were carried out\nin regard to his dear cousin. To this Mr Apjohn listened, and then\nwent on to explain what remained to be said. Though this will, which\nhe had now read, would be acted upon as though it were the last will\nand testament of the deceased,--though, in default of that for which\nfutile search had been made, it certainly was what it purported to\nbe,--still there existed in full force all those reasons which he had\nstated on the Monday for supposing that the late Squire had executed\nanother. Here Joseph Cantor, junior, gave very strong symptoms of his\ninclination to reopen that controversy, but was stopped by the joint\nefforts of his father and the lawyer. If such a document should ever\nbe found, then that would be the actual will and not the one which\nhe had now read. After that, when all due formalities had been\nperformed, he took his leave, and went back to Carmarthen.\n\nThe keys were given up to Cousin Henry, and he found himself to\nbe, in fact, the lord and master of the house, and the owner of\neverything within it. The butler, Mrs Griffith, and the gardener\ngave him notice to quit. They would stay, if he wished it, for three\nmonths, but they did not think that they could be happy in the house\nnow that the old Squire was dead, and that Miss Isabel was going\naway. There certainly did not come to him at the present moment\nany of the pleasures of ownership. He would have been willing,--he\nthought that he would have been willing,--to abandon Llanfeare\naltogether, if only it could have been abandoned without any of the\noccurrences of the last month. He would have been pleased that there\nshould have been no Llanfeare.\n\nBut as it was, he must make up his mind to something. He must hide\nthe paper in some deeper hiding place, or he must destroy it, or\nhe must reveal it. He thought that he could have dropped the book\ncontaining the will into the sea, though he could not bring himself\nto burn the will itself. The book was now his own, and he might do\nwhat he liked with it. But it would be madness to leave the paper\nthere!\n\nThen again there came to him the idea that it would be best for\nhim, and for Isabel too, to divide the property. In one way it was\nhis,--having become his without any fraudulent doing on his part. So\nhe declared to himself. In another way it was hers,--though it could\nnot become hers without some more than magnanimous interference on\nhis part. To divide it would certainly be best. But there was no\nother way of dividing it but by a marriage. For any other division,\nsuch as separating the land or the rents, no excuse could be made,\nnor would any such separation touch the fatal paper which lay between\nthe leaves of the book. Were she to consent to marry him, then he\nthought he might find courage to destroy the paper.\n\nIt was necessary that he should see her on that afternoon, if only\nthat he might bid her adieu, and tell her that she should certainly\nhave the money that had been left her. If it were possible he would\nsay a word also about that other matter.\n\n\"You did not hear the will read,\" he said to her.\n\n\"No,\" she answered abruptly.\n\n\"But you have been told its contents?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"About the four thousand pounds?\"\n\n\"There need be no question about the four thousand pounds. There is\nnot a word to be said about it,--at any rate between you and me.\"\n\n\"I have come to tell you,\" said he,--not understanding her feeling\nin the least, and evidently showing by the altered tone of his\nvoice that he thought that his communication would be received with\nfavour,--\"I have come to tell you that the legacy shall be paid in\nfull. I will see to that myself as soon as I am able to raise a penny\non the property.\"\n\n\"Pray do not trouble yourself, Cousin Henry.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly I shall.\"\n\n\"Do not trouble yourself. You may be sure of this, that on no earthly\nconsideration would I take a penny from your hands.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"We take presents from those whom we love and esteem, not from those\nwe despise.\"\n\n\"Why should you despise me?\" he asked.\n\n\"I will leave that to yourself to judge of; but be sure of this, that\nthough I were starving I would take nothing from your hands.\"\n\nThen she got up, and, retiring into the inner room, left him alone.\nIt was clear to him then that he could not divide the property with\nher in the manner that he had suggested to himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nAlone at Llanfeare\n\n\nOn the day after the reading of the will, Henry Indefer Jones, Esq.,\nof Llanfeare, as he was now to be called, was left alone in his\nhouse, his cousin Isabel having taken her departure from the place\nin the manner proposed by her. And the lawyer was gone, and the\ndoctor, and the tenants did not come near him, and the butler and the\nhousekeeper kept out of his way, and there was probably no man in all\nSouth Wales more lonely and desolate than the new Squire of Llanfeare\non that morning.\n\nThe cruelty of it, the injustice of it, the unprecedented hardness of\nit all! Such were the ideas which presented themselves to him as hour\nafter hour he sat in the book-room with his eyes fixed on the volume\nof Jeremy Taylor's sermons. He had done nothing wrong,--so he told\nhimself,--had not even coveted anything that did not belong to him.\nIt was in accordance with his uncle's expressed desire that he had\ncome to Llanfeare, and been introduced to the tenants as their future\nlandlord, and had taken upon himself the place of the heir. Then\nthe old man had announced to him his change of mind; but had not\nannounced it to others, had not declared his altered purpose to the\nworld at Llanfeare, and had not at once sent him back to his London\noffice. Had he done so, that would have been better. There would have\nbeen a gross injustice, but that would have been the end of it, and\nhe would have gone back to his London work unhappy indeed, but with\nsome possibility of life before him. Now it seemed as though any mode\nof living would be impossible to him. While that fatal paper remained\nhidden in the fatal volume he could do nothing but sit there and\nguard it in solitude.\n\nHe knew well enough that it behoved him as a man to go out about the\nestate and the neighbourhood, and to show himself, and to take some\npart in the life around him, even though he might be miserable and\na prey to terror whilst he was doing so. But he could not move from\nhis seat till his mind had been made up as to his future action. He\nwas still in fearful doubt. Through the whole of that first day he\ndeclared to himself that his resolution had not yet been made,--that\nhe had not yet determined what it would be best that he should do.\nIt was still open to him to say that at any moment he had just found\nthe will. If he could bring himself to do so he might rush off to\nCarmarthen with the document in his pocket, and still appear before\nthe lawyer as a man triumphant in his own honesty, who at the first\nmoment that it was possible had surrendered all that which was not\nlegally his own, in spite of the foul usage to which he had been\nsubjected. He might still assume the grand air of injured innocence,\ngive back the property to the young woman who had insulted him, and\nreturn to his desk in London, leaving behind him in Carmarthenshire\na character for magnanimity and honour. Such a line of conduct had\ncharms in his eyes. He was quite alive to the delight of heaping\ncoals of fire on his cousin's head. She had declared that she would\nreceive nothing at his hands, because she despised him. After that\nthere would be a sweetness, the savour of which was not lost upon his\nimagination, in forcing her to take all from his hands. And it would\nbecome known to all men that it was he who had found the will,--he\nwho might have destroyed it without the slightest danger of\ndiscovery,--he who without peril might thus have made himself owner\nof Llanfeare. There would be a delight to him in the character which\nhe would thus achieve. But then she had scorned him! No bitterer\nscorn had ever fallen from the lips or flashed from the eyes of\na woman. \"We take presents from those we love, not from those we\ndespise!\" He had not resented the words at the moment; he had not\ndared to do so; but not the less had they entered upon his very\nsoul,--not the less he hated the woman who had dared so to reply to\nthe generous offer which he had made her.\n\nAnd then there was an idea present to him through it all that\nabstract justice, if abstract justice could be reached, would declare\nthat the property should be his. The old man had made his will with\nall the due paraphernalia of will-making. There had been the lawyer\nand the witnesses brought by the lawyer; and, above all, there had\nbeen the declared reason of the will and its understood purpose.\nHe had been sent for, and all Carmarthenshire had been made to\nunderstand why it was to be so. Then, in his sickness, the old man\nhad changed his mind through some fantastic feeling, and almost\non his death-bed, with failing powers, in a condition probably\naltogether unfit for such a duty, had executed a document which the\nlaw might respect, but which true justice, if true justice could be\ninvoked, would certainly repudiate. Could the will be abolished, no\nmore than justice would be done. But, though the will were in his own\npower, it could not be abolished by his own hands.\n\nAs to that abolishing he was perfectly conscious of his own weakness.\nHe could not take the will from its hiding-place and with his own\nhand thrust it into the flames. He had never as yet even suggested to\nhimself that he would do so. His hair stood on end as he thought of\nthe horrors attendant on such a deed as that. To be made to stand in\nthe dock and be gazed at by the angry eyes of all the court, to be\nwritten of as the noted criminal of the day, to hear the verdict of\nguilty, and then the sentence, and to be aware that he was to be shut\nup and secluded from all comforts throughout his life! And then, and\nthen, the dread hereafter! For such a deed as that would there not\nbe assured damnation? Although he told himself that justice demanded\nthe destruction of the will, justice could not be achieved by his own\nhand after such fashion as that.\n\nNo; he could not himself destroy the document, though it should\nremain there for years to make his life a burden to him. As to that\nhe had made up his mind, if to nothing else. Though there might be\nno peril as to this world,--though he might certainly do the deed\nwithout a chance of detection from human eyes,--though there would in\ntruth be no prospect of that angry judge and ready jury and crushing\nsentence, yet he could not do it. There was something of a conscience\nwithin him. Were he to commit a felony, from the moment of the doing\nof the deed the fear of eternal punishment would be heavy on his\nsoul, only to be removed by confession and retribution,--and then by\nthe trial with the judge, and the jury, and the sentence! He could\nnot destroy the document. But if the book could get itself destroyed,\nwhat a blessing it would be! The book was his own, or would be in a\nfew days, when the will should have been properly proved. But if he\nwere to take away the book and sink it in a well, or throw it into\nthe sea, or bury it deep beneath the earth, then it would surely\nreappear by one of those ever-recurring accidents which are always\nbringing deeds of darkness to the light. Were he to cast the book\ninto the sea, tied with strings or cased in paper, and leaded, that\nit should surely sink, so that the will should not by untoward chance\nfloat out of it, the book tied and bound and leaded would certainly\ncome up in evidence against him. Were he to move the book, the vacant\nspace would lead to suspicion. He would be safe only by leaving the\nbook where it was, by giving no trace that he had ever been conscious\nof the contents of the book.\n\nAnd yet, if the document were left there, the book would certainly\ndivulge its dread secret at last. The day would come, might come, ah!\nso quickly, on which the document would be found, and he would be\nthrust out, penniless as far as any right to Llanfeare was concerned.\nSome maid-servant might find it; some religious inmate of his house\nwho might come there in search of godly teaching! If he could only\nbring himself to do something at once,--to declare that it was there,\nso that he might avoid all these future miseries! But why had she\ntold him that she despised him, and why had the old man treated him\nwith such unexampled cruelty? So it went on with him for three or\nfour days, during which he still kept his place among the books.\n\nThere would be great delight in possessing Llanfeare, if he could\nin very truth possess it. He would not live there. No; certainly\nnot that. Every tenant about the place had shown him that he was\ndespised. Their manner to him before the old Squire's death, their\nfaces as they had sat there during the ceremonies of the will, and\nthe fact that no one had been near him since the reading of the will,\nhad shown him that. He had not dared to go to church during the\nSunday; and though no one had spoken to him of his daily life, he\nfelt that tales were being told of him. He was sure that Mrs Griffith\nhad whispered about the place the fact of his constant residence\nin one room, and that those who heard it would begin to say among\nthemselves that a practice so strange must be connected with the\nmissing will. No, he would not willingly live at Llanfeare. But if he\ncould let Llanfeare, were it but for a song, and enjoy the rents up\nin London, how pleasant would that be! But then, had ever any man\nsuch a sword of Damocles to hang over his head by a single hair, as\nwould be then hanging over his head were he to let Llanfeare or even\nto leave the house, while that book with its inclosure was there\nupon the shelves? It did seem to him, as he thought of it, that life\nwould be impossible to him in any room but that as long as the will\nremained among the leaves of the volume.\n\nSince the moment in which he had discovered the will he had felt the\nnecessity of dealing with the officials of the office in London at\nwhich he had been employed. This was an establishment called the Sick\nand Healthy Life Assurance Company, in which he held some shares, and\nat which he was employed as a clerk. It would of course be necessary\nthat he should either resign his place or go back to his duties. That\nthe Squire of Llanfeare should be a clerk at the Sick and Healthy\nwould be an anomaly. Could he really be in possession of his rents,\nthe Sick and Healthy would of course see no more of him; but were\nhe to throw up his position and then to lose Llanfeare, how sad,\nhow terrible, how cruel would be his fate! But yet something must\nbe done. In these circumstances he wrote a letter to the manager,\ndetailing all the circumstances with a near approach to the truth,\nkeeping back only the one little circumstance that he himself was\nacquainted with the whereabouts of the missing will.\n\n\"It may turn up at any moment,\" he explained to the manager, \"so\nthat my position as owner of the property is altogether insecure. I\nfeel this so thoroughly that were I forced at the present to choose\nbetween the two I should keep my clerkship in the office; but as the\ncondition of things is so extraordinary, perhaps the directors will\nallow me six months in which to come to a decision, during which I\nmay hold my place, without, of course, drawing any salary.\"\n\nSurely, he thought, he could decide on something before the six\nmonths should be over. Either he would have destroyed the will, or\nhave sunk the book beneath the waves, or have resolved to do that\nmagnanimous deed which it was still within his power to achieve. The\nonly one thing not possible would be for him to leave Llanfeare and\ntake himself up to the delights of London while the document was yet\nhidden within the volume.\n\n\"I suppose sir, you don't know yet as to what your plans are going\nto be?\" This was said by Mrs Griffith as soon as she made her way\ninto the book-room after a somewhat imperious knocking at the door.\nHitherto there had been but little communication between Cousin Henry\nand his servants since the death of the old Squire. Mrs Griffith\nhad given him warning that she would leave his service, and he had\nsomewhat angrily told her that she might go as soon as it pleased\nher. Since that she had come to him once daily for his orders, and\nthose orders had certainly been very simple. He had revelled in no\nluxuries of the table or the cellar since the keys of the house had\nbeen committed to his charge. She had been told to provide him with\nsimple food, and with food she had provided him. The condition of his\nmind had been such that no appetite for the glories of a rich man's\ntable had yet come to him. That accursed book on the opposite shelf\nhad destroyed all his taste for both wine and meat.\n\n\"What do you want to know for?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, sir; it is customary for the housekeeper to know something,\nand if there is no mistress she can only go to the master. We always\nwere very quiet here, but Miss Isabel used to tell me something of\nwhat was expected.\"\n\n\"I don't expect anything,\" said Cousin Henry.\n\n\"Is there anybody to come in my place?\" she asked.\n\n\"What can that be to you? You can go when you please.\"\n\n\"The other servants want to go, too. Sally won't stay, nor yet Mrs\nBridgeman.\" Mrs Bridgeman was the cook. \"They say they don't like to\nlive with a gentleman who never goes out of one room.\"\n\n\"What is it to them what room I live in? I suppose I may live in what\nroom I please in my own house.\" This he said with an affectation of\nanger, feeling that he was bound to be indignant at such inquiries\nfrom his own servant, but with more of fear than wrath in his mind.\nSo they had in truth already begun to inquire why it was that he sat\nthere watching the books!\n\n\"Just so, Mr Jones. Of course you can live anywhere you like,--in\nyour own house.\"\n\nThere was an emphasis on the last words which was no doubt intended\nto be impertinent. Every one around was impertinent to him.\n\n\"But so can they, sir,--not in their own house. They can look for\nsituations, and I thought it my duty just to tell you, because you\nwouldn't like to find yourself all alone here, by yourself like.\"\n\n\"Why is it that everybody turns against me?\" he asked suddenly,\nalmost bursting into tears.\n\nAt this her woman's heart was a little softened, though she did\ndespise him thoroughly. \"I don't know about turning, Mr Jones, but\nthey have been used to such different ways.\"\n\n\"Don't they get enough to eat?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; there's enough to eat, no doubt. I don't know as you have\ninterfered about that; not but what as master you might. It isn't the\nvictuals.\"\n\n\"What is it, Mrs Griffith? Why do they want to go away?\"\n\n\"Well, it is chiefly because of your sitting here alone,--never\nmoving, never having your hat on your head, sir. Of course a\ngentleman can do as he pleases in his own house. There is nothing\nto make him go out, not even to see his own tenants, nor his own\nfarm, nor nothing else. He's his own master, sir, in course;--but\nit is mysterious. There is nothing goes against them sort of\npeople,\"--meaning the servants inferior to herself,--\"like\nmysteries.\"\n\nThen they already felt that there was a mystery! Oh! what a fool he\nhad been to shut himself up and eat his food there! Of course they\nwould know that this mystery must have some reference to the will.\nThus they would so far have traced the truth as to have learnt that\nthe will had a mystery, and that the mystery was located in that\nroom!\n\nThere is a pleasant game, requiring much sagacity, in which, by a\nfew answers, one is led closer and closer to a hidden word, till one\nis enabled to touch it. And as with such a word, so it was with his\nsecret. He must be careful that no eye should once see that his face\nwas turned towards the shelf. At this very moment he shifted his\nposition so as not to look at the shelf, and then thought that she\nwould have observed the movement, and divined the cause.\n\n\"Anyways, they begs to say respectful that they wishes you to take\na month's warning. As for me, I wouldn't go to inconvenience my old\nmaster's heir. I'll stay till you suits yourself, Mr Jones; but the\nold place isn't to me now what it was.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mrs Griffith,\" said Cousin Henry, trying to fix his eyes\nupon an open book in his hands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nCousin Henry Dreams a Dream\n\n\nFrom what had passed with Mrs Griffith, it was clear to Cousin Henry\nthat he must go out of the house and be seen about the place. The\nwoman had been right in saying that his seclusion was mysterious.\nIt was peculiarly imperative upon him to avoid all appearance of\nmystery. He ought to have been aware of this before. He ought to\nhave thought of it, and not to have required to be reminded by a\nrebuke from the housekeeper. He could now only amend the fault for\nthe future, and endeavour to live down the mystery which had been\ncreated. Almost as soon as Mrs Griffith had left him, he prepared to\nmove. But then he bethought himself that he must not seem to have\nobeyed, quite at the moment, the injunctions of his own servant;\nso he re-seated himself, resolved to postpone for a day or two his\nintention of calling upon one of the tenants. He re-seated himself,\nbut turned his back to the shelf, lest the aspect of his countenance\nshould be watched through the window.\n\nOn the following morning he was relieved from his immediate\ndifficulty by the arrival of a letter from Mr Apjohn. It was\nnecessary that a declaration as to the will should be made before\na certain functionary at Carmarthen, and as the papers necessary\nfor the occasion had been prepared in the lawyer's office, he was\nsummoned into Carmarthen for the purpose. Immediately after that he\nwould be put into full possession of the property. Mr Apjohn also\ninformed him that the deed had been prepared for charging the estate\nwith four thousand pounds on behalf of his Cousin Isabel. By this he\nwould bind himself to pay her two hundred a year for the next two\nyears, and at the end of that period to hand over to her the entire\nsum. Here was an excuse provided for him to leave the house and\ntravel as far as Carmarthen. There were the horses and the carriage\nwith which his uncle had been accustomed to be taken about the\nestate, and there was still the old coachman, who had been in the\nservice for the last twenty years. So he gave his orders, and\ndirected that the carriage should be ready soon after two, in order\nthat he might keep the appointment made by the lawyer at three. The\norder was sent out to the stable through the butler, and as he gave\nit he felt how unable he was to assume the natural tone of a master\nto his servants.\n\n\"The carriage, sir!\" said the butler, as though surprised. Then the\nowner of Llanfeare found himself compelled to explain to his own man\nthat it was necessary that he should see the lawyer in Carmarthen.\n\nShould he or should he not take the book with him as he went? It\nwas a large volume, and could not well be concealed in his pocket.\nHe might no doubt take a book,--any book,--with him for his own\nrecreation in the carriage; but were he to do so, the special book\nwhich he had selected would be marked to the eyes of the servants. It\nrequired but little thought to tell him that the book must certainly\nbe left in its place. He could have taken the will and kept it safe,\nand certainly unseen, in the pocket of his coat. But then, to take\nthe will from its hiding-place and to have it on his person, unless\nhe did so for the purpose of instant and public revelation, would, as\nhe thought, be in itself a felony. There would be the doing of a deed\nin the very act of abstracting the document; and his safety lay in\nthe abstaining from any deed. What if a fit should come upon him,\nor he should fall and hurt himself and the paper be found in his\npossession? Then there would at once be the intervention of the\npolice, and the cell, and the angry voices of the crowd, and the\nscowling of the judge, and the quick sentence, and that dwelling\namong thieves and felons for the entire period of his accursed life!\nThen would that great command, \"Thou shalt not steal,\" be sounding\nalways in his ear! Then would self-condemnation be heavy upon him!\nNot to tell of the document, not to touch it, not to be responsible\nin any way for its position there on the shelf,--that was not to\nsteal it. Hitherto the word \"felon\" had not come home to his soul.\nBut were he to have it in his pocket, unless with that purpose of\nmagnanimity of which he thought so often, then he would be a felon.\n\nSoon after two he left the room, and at the moment was unable not to\nturn a rapid glance upon the book. There it was, safe in its place.\nHow well he knew the appearance of the volume! On the back near the\nbottom was a small speck, a spot on the binding, which had been so\nfar disfigured by some accident in use. This seemed to his eyes to\nmake it marked and separate among a thousand. To him it was almost\nwonderful that a stain so peculiar should not at once betray the\nvolume to the eyes of all. But there it was, such as it was, and he\nleft it amidst its perils. Should they pounce upon it the moment that\nhe had left the room, they could not say that he was guilty because\nit contained the will.\n\nHe went to Carmarthen, and there his courage was subjected to a\nterrible trial. He was called upon to declare before the official\nthat to the best of his belief the will, which was about to be\nproved, was the last will and testament of Indefer Jones. Had this\nbeen explained to him by the lawyer in his letter, he might probably\nhave abstained from so damning a falsehood. There would have been\ntime then for some resolution. Had Mr Apjohn told him what it was\nthat he was about to be called upon to perform, even then, before\nthe necessity of performance was presented to him, there would have\nbeen a moment for consideration, and he might have doubted. Had he\nhesitated in the presence of the lawyer, all would have been made\nknown. But he was carried before the official not knowing that the\nlie was to be submitted to him, and before he could collect his\nthoughts the false declaration had been made!\n\n\"You understand, Mr Jones,\" said the lawyer in the presence of the\nofficial, \"that we still think that a further will may eventually be\nfound?\"\n\n\"I understand that,\" croaked the poor wretch.\n\n\"It is well that you should bear it in mind,\" said Mr Apjohn\nseverely;--\"for your own sake, I mean.\"\n\nThere was nothing further spoken on the subject, and he was given\nto understand that Llanfeare was now in truth his own;--his own,\nwhatever chance there might be that it should be wrested from him\nhereafter.\n\nThen followed the business as to the charge upon the property which\nwas to be made on behalf of Isabel. The deeds were prepared, and only\nrequired the signature of the new Squire.\n\n\"But she has refused to take a penny from me,\" said the Squire,\nhesitating with a pen in his hand. Let us give him his due by\ndeclaring that, much as he hated his cousin, he did not doubt as to\nbestowing the money upon her. As far as he was concerned, she was\nwelcome to the four thousand pounds.\n\nBut the lawyer misinterpreted his client's manner. \"I should think,\nMr Jones,\" he said, with still increased severity, \"that you would\nhave felt that under the peculiar circumstances you were bound to\nrestore to your cousin money which was expended by your uncle under a\nmisconception in purchasing land which will now be yours.\"\n\n\"What can I do if she will not take it?\"\n\n\"Not take it? That is an absurdity. In a matter of such importance as\nthis she will of course be guided by her father. It is not a matter\nrequiring gratitude on her part. The money ought to be regarded as\nher own, and you will only be restoring to her what is in truth her\nown.\"\n\n\"I am quite willing. I have made no difficulty, Mr Apjohn. I don't\nunderstand why you should speak to me in that way about it, as though\nI had hesitated about the money.\" Nevertheless, the lawyer maintained\nthe severe look, and there was still the severe tone as the poor\nwretch left the office. In all this there was so great an aggravation\nof his misery! It was only too manifest that every one suspected him\nof something. Here he was ready to give away,--absolutely anxious\nto give away out of his own pocket,--a very large sum of money to\nhis cousin who had misused and insulted him, by signing the document\nwithout a moment's hesitation as soon as it was presented to him, and\nyet he was rebuked for his demeanour as he did it. Oh, that accursed\nwill! Why had his uncle summoned him away from the comparative\ncomfort of his old London life?\n\nWhen he returned to the book-room, he made himself sure that the\nvolume had not been moved. There was a slight variation in the\npositions of that and the two neighbouring books, the centre one\nhaving been pushed a quarter of an inch further in; and all this he\nhad marked so accurately that he could not but know whether any hand\nhad been at the shelf. He did not go near to the shelf, but could see\nthe variation as he stood at the table. His eye had become minutely\nexact as to the book and its position. Then he resolved that he would\nnot look at the book again, would not turn a glance on it unless it\nmight be when he had made up his mind to reveal its contents. His\nneck became absolutely stiff with the efforts necessary not to look\nat the book.\n\nThat night he wrote a letter to his cousin, which was as follows:--\n\n\n   MY DEAR ISABEL,\n\n   I have been into Carmarthen to-day, and I have signed\n   a document in the presence of Mr Apjohn, by which four\n   thousand pounds is made over to you as a charge upon the\n   property. He stated that you had what might be called a\n   right to that money, and I perfectly agreed with him. I\n   have never doubted about the money since my uncle's will\n   was read. The agent who receives the rents will remit to\n   you one hundred pounds half yearly for the next two years.\n   By that time I shall have been able to raise the money,\n   and you shall then be paid in full.\n\n   I don't want you to take this as any favour from me. I\n   quite understood what you said to me. I think that it was\n   undeserved, and, after all that I have suffered in this\n   matter, cruel on your part. It was not my fault that my\n   uncle changed his mind backwards and forwards. I never\n   asked him for the estate. I came to Llanfeare only because\n   he bade me. I have taken possession of the property only\n   when told to do so by Mr Apjohn. If I could not make\n   myself pleasant to you, it was not my fault. I think you\n   ought to be ashamed of what you said to me,--so soon after\n   the old man's death!\n\n   But all that has nothing to do with the money, which, of\n   course, you must take. As for myself, I do not think I\n   shall continue to live here. My uncle has made the place\n   a nest of hornets for me, and all through no fault of my\n   own. Should you like to come and live here as owner, you\n   are welcome to do so on paying me a certain sum out of the\n   rents. I am quite in earnest, and you had better think of\n   it.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   HENRY JONES.\n\n\nHis resolution as to the first portion of the above letter was taken\nas he returned in the carriage from Carmarthen; but it was not until\nthe pen was in his hand, and the angry paragraph had been written in\nwhich he complained of her cruelty, that he thought of making that\noffer to her as to the residence. The idea flashed across his mind,\nand then was carried out instantly. Let her come and live there, and\nlet her find the will herself if she pleased. If her mind was given\nto godly reading, this might be her reward. Such conduct would, at\nany rate, show them all that he was afraid of nothing. He would, he\nthought, if this could be arranged, still remain at his office; would\ngive up that empty title of Squire of Llanfeare, and live in such\ncomfort as might come to him from the remittances which would be made\nto him on account of the rents, till--that paper had been found. Such\nwas his last plan, and the letter proposing it was duly sent to the\npost office.\n\nOn the following day he again acknowledged the necessity of going\nabout the place,--so that the feeling of mystery might, if possible,\nbe gradually dissipated,--and he went out for a walk. He roamed down\ntowards the cliffs, and there sat in solitude, looking out upon the\nwaters. His mind was still intent upon the book. Oh, if the book\ncould be buried there below the sea,--be drowned and no hand of his\nbe necessary for the drowning! As he sat there, feeling himself\nconstrained to remain away from the house for a certain period, he\nfell asleep by degrees and dreamed. He dreamt that he was out there\nin a little boat all alone, with the book hidden under the seats, and\nthat he rowed himself out to sea till he was so far distant from the\nshore that no eye could see him. Then he lifted the book, and was\nabout to rid himself for ever of his burden,--when there came by a\nstrong man swimming. The man looked up at him so as to see exactly\nwhat he was doing, and the book was not thrown over, and the face of\nthe swimming man was the face of that young Cantor who had been so\ndetermined in his assertion that another will had been made.\n\nThe dream was still vivid as a reality to his intellect when he was\nawakened suddenly, whether by a touch or a sound he did not know. He\nlooked up, and there was the young man whom he had seen swimming to\nhim across the sea. The land he was on was a portion of old Cantor's\nfarm, and the presence of the son need not have surprised him had he\nthought of it; but it was to him as though the comer had read every\nthought of his mind, and had understood clearly the purport of the\ndream.\n\n\"Be that you, Squire?\" said the young man.\n\n\"Yes, it is I,\" said Cousin Henry, as he lay trembling on the grass.\n\n\"I didn't know you was here, sir. I didn't know you ever com'd here.\nGood morning, sir.\" Then the young man passed on, not caring to have\nany further conversation with a landlord so little to his taste.\n\nAfter this he returned home almost cowed. But on the following\nmorning he determined to make a still further effort, so that he\nmight, if possible, return to the ways of the world, which were\nalready becoming strange to him from the desolation of the life which\nhe had been leading. He went out, and, taking the road by the church,\nup the creek, he came at about a distance of two miles from his own\nhouse to Coed, the farmstead of John Griffith, the farmer who held\nthe largest number of acres on the property. At the garden gate\nhe found his tenant, whom he was inclined to think somewhat more\ncivil,--a little, perhaps, more courteous,--than others who had met\nhim.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said John Griffith, \"it's a fine day, and the crops are\ndoing well enough. Would you like to come in and see the missus?\nShe'll take it civil.\"\n\nCousin Henry entered the house and said a few words to the farmer's\nwife, who was not, however, specially gracious in her demeanour. He\nhad not the gift of saying much to such persons, and was himself\naware of his own deficiency. But still he had done something,--had\nshown that he was not afraid to enter a tenant's house. As he was\nleaving, the farmer followed him to the gate, and began to offer him\nsome advice, apparently in kindness.\n\n\"You ought to be doing something, sir, with those paddocks between\nthe shrubberies and the road.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, Mr Griffith; but I am no farmer.\"\n\n\"Then let them, sir. William Griffith will be glad enough to have\nthem and pay you rent. The old Squire didn't like that the land he\nhad held himself should go into other hands. But he never did much\ngood with them lately, and it's different now.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's different now. I don't think I shall live here, Mr\nGriffith.\"\n\n\"Not live at Llanfeare?\"\n\n\"I think not. I'm not quite fitted to the place. It isn't my doing,\nbut among you all, I fear, you don't like me.\" As he said this he\ntried to carry it off with a laugh.\n\n\"You'd live down that, Squire, if you did your duty, and was good\nto the people;--and took no more than was your own. But perhaps you\ndon't like a country life.\"\n\n\"I don't like being where I ain't liked; that's the truth of it, Mr\nGriffith.\"\n\n\"Who'll come in your place, if I may be so bold as to ask?\"\n\n\"Miss Brodrick shall,--if she will. It was not I who asked my uncle\nto bring me here.\"\n\n\"But she is not to have the property?\"\n\n\"Not the property;--at least I suppose not. But she shall have the\nhouse and the grounds, and the land adjacent. And she shall manage it\nall, dividing the rents with me, or something of that kind. I have\noffered it to her, but I do not say that she will agree. In the\nmeantime, if you will come up and see me sometimes, I will take it\nas a kindness. I do not know that I have done any harm, so as to be\nshunned.\"\n\nThen Farmer Griffith readily said that he would go up occasionally\nand see his landlord.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nIsabel at Hereford\n\n\nIsabel had not been many hours at home at Hereford before, as was\nnatural, her father discussed with her the affairs of the property\nand her own peculiar interest in the will which had at last been\naccepted. It has to be acknowledged that Isabel was received somewhat\nas an interloper in the house. She was not wanted there, at any\nrate by her stepmother,--hardly by her brothers and sisters,--and\nwas, perhaps, not cordially desired even by her father. She and her\nstepmother had never been warm friends. Isabel herself was clever and\nhigh-minded; but high-spirited also, imperious, and sometimes hard.\nIt may be said of her that she was at all points a gentlewoman. So\nmuch could hardly be boasted of the present Mrs Brodrick; and, as\nwas the mother, so were that mother's children. The father was a\ngentleman, born and bred as such; but in his second marriage he\nhad fallen a little below his station, and, having done so, had\naccommodated himself to his position. Then there had come many\nchildren, and the family had increased quicker than the income. So it\nhad come to pass that the attorney was not a wealthy man. This was\nthe home which Isabel had been invited to leave when, now many years\nsince, she had gone to Llanfeare to become her uncle's darling. There\nher life had been very different from that of the family at Hereford.\nShe had seen but little of society, but had been made much of, and\nalmost worshipped, by those who were around her. She was to be,--was\nto have been,--the Lady of Llanfeare. By every tenant about the\nplace she had been loved and esteemed. With the servants she had\nbeen supreme. Even at Carmarthen, when she was seen there, she\nwas regarded as the great lady, the acknowledged heiress, who was\nto have, at some not very distant time, all Llanfeare in her own\nhands. It was said of her, and said truly, that she was possessed\nof many virtues. She was charitable, careful for others, in no\nway self-indulgent, sedulous in every duty, and, above all things,\naffectionately attentive to her uncle. But she had become imperious,\nand inclined to domineer, if not in action, yet in spirit. She had\nlived much among books, had delighted to sit gazing over the sea with\na volume of poetry in her hand, truly enjoying the intellectual gifts\nwhich had been given her. But she had, perhaps, learnt too thoroughly\nher own superiority, and was somewhat apt to look down upon the less\nrefined pleasure of other people. And now her altered position in\nregard to wealth rather increased than diminished her foibles. Now,\nin her abject poverty,--for she was determined that it should be\nabject,--she would be forced to sustain her superiority solely by\nher personal gifts. She determined that, should she find herself\ncompelled to live in her father's house, she would do her duty\nthoroughly by her stepmother and her sisters. She would serve them as\nfar as it might be within her power; but she could not giggle with\nthe girls, nor could she talk little gossip with Mrs Brodrick. While\nthere was work to be done, she would do it, though it should be hard,\nmenial, and revolting; but when her work was done, there would be her\nbooks.\n\nIt will be understood that, such being her mood and such her\ncharacter, she would hardly make herself happy in her father's\nhouse,--or make others happy. And then, added to all this, there was\nthe terrible question of money! When last at Hereford, she had told\nher father that, though her uncle had revoked his grand intention in\nher favour, still there would be coming to her enough to prevent her\nfrom being a burden on the resources of her family. Now that was all\nchanged. If her father should be unable or unwilling to support her,\nshe would undergo any hardship, any privation; but would certainly\nnot accept bounty from the hands of her cousin. Some deed had been\ndone, she felt assured,--some wicked deed, and Cousin Henry had been\nthe doer of it. She and she alone had heard the last words which her\nuncle had spoken, and she had watched the man's face narrowly when\nher uncle's will had been discussed in the presence of the tenants.\nShe was quite sure. Let her father say what he might, let her\nstepmother look at her ever so angrily with her greedy, hungry eyes,\nshe would take no shilling from her Cousin Henry. Though she might\nhave to die in the streets, she would take no bread from her Cousin\nHenry's hand.\n\nShe herself began the question of the money on the day after her\narrival. \"Papa,\" she said, \"there is to be nothing for me after all.\"\n\nNow Mr Apjohn, the lawyer, like a cautious family solicitor as he\nwas, had written to Mr Brodrick, giving him a full account of the\nwhole affair, telling him of the legacy of four thousand pounds,\nexplaining that there was no fund from which payment could be legally\nexacted, but stating also that the circumstances of the case were\nof such a nature as to make it almost impossible that the new heir\nshould refuse to render himself liable for the amount. Then had come\nanother letter saying that the new heir had assented to do so.\n\n\"Oh, yes, there will, Isabel,\" said the father.\n\nThen she felt that the fighting of the battle was incumbent upon her,\nand she was determined to fight it. \"No, papa, no; not a shilling.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, yes,\" he said, smiling. \"I have heard from Mr Apjohn,\nand understood all about it. The money, no doubt, is not there; but\nyour cousin is quite prepared to charge the estate with the amount.\nIndeed, it would be almost impossible for him to refuse to do so. No\none would speak to him were he to be so base as that. I do not think\nmuch of your Cousin Henry, but even Cousin Henry could not be so\nmean. He has not the courage for such villainy.\"\n\n\"I have the courage,\" said she.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, do not be angry with me! Nothing,--nothing shall induce me\nto take my Cousin Henry's money.\"\n\n\"It will be your money,--your money by your uncle's will. It is the\nvery sum which he himself has named as intended for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, papa; but Uncle Indefer had not got the money to give. Neither\nyou nor I should be angry with him; because he intended the best.\"\n\n\"I am angry with him,\" said the attorney in wrath, \"because he\ndeceived you and deceived me about the property.\"\n\n\"Never; he deceived no one. Uncle Indefer and deceit never went\ntogether.\"\n\n\"There is no question of that now,\" said the father. \"He made some\nslight restitution, and there can, of course, be no question as to\nyour taking it.\"\n\n\"There is a question, and there must be a question, papa. I will not\nhave it. If my being here would be an expense too great for you, I\nwill go away.\"\n\n\"Where will you go?\"\n\n\"I care not where I go. I will earn my bread. If I cannot do that, I\nwould rather live in the poor-house than accept my cousin's money.\"\n\n\"What has he done?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"As Mr Apjohn very well puts it, there is no question whatsoever as\nto gratitude, or even of acceptance. It is a matter of course. He\nwould be inexpressibly vile were he not to do this.\"\n\n\"He is inexpressibly vile.\"\n\n\"Not in this respect. He is quite willing. You will have nothing to\ndo but to sign a receipt once every half-year till the whole sum\nshall have been placed to your credit.\"\n\n\"I will sign nothing on that account; nor will I take anything.\"\n\n\"But why not? What has he done?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I do not say that he has done anything. I do not care\nto speak of him. Pray do not think, papa, that I covet the estate,\nor that I am unhappy about that. Had he been pleasant to my uncle\nand good to the tenants, had he seemed even to be like a man, I\ncould have made him heartily welcome to Llanfeare. I think my uncle\nwas right in choosing to have a male heir. I should have done so\nmyself--in his place.\"\n\n\"He was wrong, wickedly wrong, after his promises.\"\n\n\"There were no promises made to me: nothing but a suggestion, which\nhe was, of course, at liberty to alter if he pleased. We need not,\nhowever, go back to that, papa. There he is, owner of Llanfeare,\nand from him, as owner of Llanfeare, I will accept nothing. Were I\nstarving in the street I would not take a crust of bread from his\nfingers.\"\n\nOver and over again the conversation was renewed, but always with\nthe same result. Then there was a correspondence between the two\nattorneys, and Mr Apjohn undertook to ask permission from the\nSquire to pay the money to the father's receipt without asking any\nacknowledgement from the daughter. On hearing this, Isabel declared\nthat if this were done she would certainly leave her father's house.\nShe would go out of it, even though she should not know whither she\nwas going. Circumstances should not be made so to prevail upon her as\nto force her to eat meat purchased by her cousin's money.\n\nThus it came to pass that Isabel's new home was not made comfortable\nto her on her first arrival. Her stepmother would hardly speak to\nher, and the girls knew that she was in disgrace. There was Mr Owen,\nwilling enough, as the stepmother knew, to take Isabel away and\nrelieve them all from this burden, and with the \u00c2\u00a34000 Mr Owen would,\nno doubt, be able at once to provide a home for her. But Mr Owen\ncould hardly do this without some help. And even though Mr Owen\nshould be so generous,--and thus justify the name of \"softie\" which\nMrs Brodrick would sometimes give him in discussing his character\nwith her own daughters,--how preferable would it be to have a\nrelation well-provided! To Mrs Brodrick the girl's objection was\naltogether unintelligible. The more of a Philistine Cousin Henry was,\nthe more satisfaction should there be in fleecing him. To refuse\na legacy because it was not formal was, to her thinking, an act\nof insanity. To have the payment of one refused to her because of\ninformality would have been heart-breaking. But the making of such\na difficulty as this she could not stomach. Could she have had her\nwill, she would have been well pleased to whip the girl! Therefore\nIsabel's new home was not pleasant to her.\n\nAt this time Mr Owen was away, having gone for his holiday to the\nContinent. To all the Brodricks it was a matter of course that he\nwould marry Isabel as soon as he came back. There was no doubt that\nhe was \"a softie.\" But then how great is the difference between\nhaving a brother-in-law well off, and a relation tightly constrained\nby closely limited means! To refuse,--even to make a show of\nrefusing,--those good things was a crime against the husband who\nwas to have them. Such was the light in which Mrs Brodrick looked\nat it. To Mr Brodrick himself there was an obstinacy in it which\nwas sickening to him. But to Isabel's thinking the matter was very\ndifferent. She was as firmly resolved that she would not marry Mr\nOwen as that she would not take her cousin's money;--almost as firmly\nresolved.\n\nThen there came the angry letter from Cousin Henry, containing two\npoints which had to be considered. There was the offer to her to come\nto Llanfeare, and live there as though she was herself the owner.\nThat, indeed, did not require much consideration. It was altogether\nout of the question, and only dwelt in her thoughts as showing how\nquickly the man had contrived to make himself odious to every one\nabout the place. His uncle, he said, had made the place a nest of\nhornets to him. Isabel declared that she knew why the place was a\nnest of hornets. There was no one about Llanfeare to whom so unmanly,\nso cringing, so dishonest a creature would not be odious. She could\nunderstand all that.\n\nBut then there was the other point, and on that her mind rested long.\n\n\"I think you ought to be ashamed of what you said to me,--so soon\nafter the old man's death.\"\n\nShe sat long in silence thinking of it, meditating whether he had\nbeen true in that,--whether it did behove her to repent her harshness\nto the man. She remembered well her words;--\"We take presents from\nthose we love, not from those we despise.\"\n\nThey had been hard words--quite unjustifiable unless he had made\nhimself guilty of something worse than conduct that was simply\ndespicable. Not because he had been a poor creature, not because he\nhad tormented the old man's last days by an absence of all generous\nfeeling, not because he had been altogether unlike what, to her\nthinking, a Squire of Llanfeare should be, had she answered him with\nthose crushing words. It was because at the moment she had believed\nhim to be something infinitely worse than that.\n\nGrounding her aversion on such evidence as she had,--on such evidence\nas she thought she had,--she had brought against him her heavy\naccusation. She could not tell him to his face that he had stolen\nthe will, she could not accuse him of felony, but she had used such\nquick mode of expression as had come to her for assuring him that\nhe stood as low in her esteem as a felon might stand. And this she\nhad done when he was endeavouring to perform to her that which had\nbeen described to him as a duty! And now he had turned upon her and\nrebuked her,--rebuked her as he was again endeavouring to perform the\nsame duty,--rebuked her as it was so natural that a man should do who\nhad been subjected to so gross an affront!\n\nShe hated him, despised him, and in her heart condemned him. She\nstill believed him to have been guilty. Had he not been guilty, the\nbeads of perspiration would not have stood upon his brow; he would\nnot have become now red, now pale, by sudden starts; he would not\nhave quivered beneath her gaze when she looked into his face. He\ncould not have been utterly mean as he was, had he not been guilty.\nBut yet,--and now she saw it with her clear-seeing intellect, now\nthat her passion was in abeyance,--she had not been entitled to\naccuse him to his face. If he were guilty, it was for others to find\nit out, and for others to accuse him. It had been for her as a lady,\nand as her uncle's niece, to accept him in her uncle's house as her\nuncle's heir. No duty could have compelled her to love him, no duty\nwould have required her to accept even his friendship. But she was\naware that she had misbehaved herself in insulting him. She was\nashamed of herself in that she had not been able to hide her feelings\nwithin her own high heart, but had allowed him to suppose that she\nhad been angered because she had been deprived of her uncle's wealth.\nHaving so resolved, she wrote to him as follows:--\n\n\n   MY DEAR HENRY,\n\n   Do not take any further steps about the money, as I am\n   quite determined not to accept it. I hope it will not be\n   sent, as there would only be the trouble of repaying it. I\n   do not think that it would do for me to live at Llanfeare,\n   as I should have no means of supporting myself, let alone\n   the servants. The thing is of course out of the question.\n   You tell me that I ought to be ashamed of myself for\n   certain words that I spoke to you. They should not have\n   been spoken. I am ashamed of myself, and I now send you my\n   apology.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   ISABEL BRODRICK.\n\n\nThe reader may perhaps understand that these words were written by\nher with extreme anguish; but of that her Cousin Henry understood\nnothing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nMr Owen\n\n\nIn this way Isabel spent four very uncomfortable weeks in her new\nhome before Mr Owen returned to Hereford. Nor was her discomfort much\nrelieved by the prospect of his return. She knew all the details of\nhis circumstances, and told herself that the man would be wrong to\nmarry without any other means than those he at present possessed. Nor\ndid she think of herself that she was well qualified to be the wife\nof a poor gentleman. She believed that she could starve if it were\nrequired of her, and support her sufferings with fortitude. She\nbelieved that she could work,--work from morning till night, from\nweek to week, from month to month, without complaining; but she did\nnot think that she could make herself sweet as a wife should be sweet\nto a husband with a threadbare coat, or that she could be tender\nas a mother should be tender while dividing limited bread among\nher children. To go and die and have done with it, if that might\nbe possible, was the panacea of her present troubles most commonly\npresent to her mind. Therefore, there was no comfort to her in that\npromised coming of her lover of which the girls chattered to her\ncontinually. She had refused her lover when she held the proud\nposition of the heiress of Llanfeare,--refused him, no doubt, in\nobedience to her uncle's word, and not in accordance with her own\nfeelings; but still she had refused him. Afterwards, when she had\nbelieved that there would be a sum of money coming to her from her\nuncle's will, there had been room for possible doubt. Should the\nmoney have proved sufficient to cause her to be a relief rather than\na burden to the husband, it might have been her duty to marry him,\nseeing that she loved him with all her heart,--seeing that she was\nsure of his love. There would have been much against it even then,\nbecause she had refused him when she had been a grand lady; but, had\nthe money been forthcoming, there might have been a doubt. Now there\ncould be no doubt. Should she who had denied him her hand because\nshe was her uncle's heiress,--on that avowed ground alone,--should\nshe, now that she was a pauper, burden him with her presence? He,\nno doubt, would be generous enough to renew his offer. She was well\naware of his nobility. But she, too, could be generous, and, as she\nthought, noble. Thus it was that her spirit spoke within her, bidding\nher subject all the sweet affections of her heart to a stubborn\npride.\n\nThe promised return, therefore, of Mr Owen did not make her very\nhappy.\n\n\"He will be here to-morrow,\" said her stepmother to her. \"Mrs\nRichards expects him by the late train to-night. I looked in there\nyesterday and she told me.\" Mrs Richards was the respectable lady\nwith whom Mr Owen lodged.\n\n\"I dare say he will,\" said Isabel wearily--sorry, too, that Mr Owen's\ngoings and comings should have been investigated.\n\n\"Now, Isabel, let me advise you. You cannot be so unjust to Mr Owen\nas to make him fancy for a moment that you will refuse your uncle's\nmoney. Think of his position,--about two hundred and fifty a year\nin all! With your two hundred added it would be positive comfort;\nwithout it you would be frightfully poor.\"\n\n\"Do you think I have not thought of it?\"\n\n\"I suppose you must. But then you are so odd and so hard, so unlike\nany other girl I ever saw. I don't see how you could have the face to\nrefuse the money, and then to eat his bread.\"\n\nThis was an unfortunate speech as coming from Mrs Brodrick, because\nit fortified Isabel in the reply she was bound to make. Hitherto the\nstepmother had thought it certain that the marriage would take place\nin spite of such maiden denials as the girl had made; but now the\ndenial had to be repeated with more than maiden vigour.\n\n\"I have thought of it,\" said Isabel,--\"thought of it very often, till\nI have told myself that conduct such as that would be inexpressibly\nbase. What! to eat his bread after refusing him mine when it was\nbelieved to be so plentiful! I certainly have not face enough to do\nthat,--neither face nor courage for that. There are ignoble things\nwhich require audacity altogether beyond my reach.\"\n\n\"Then you must accept the money from your cousin.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Isabel; \"neither that nor yet the position\nwhich Mr Owen will perhaps offer me again.\"\n\n\"Of course he will offer it to you.\"\n\n\"Then he must be told that on no consideration can his offer be\naccepted.\"\n\n\"This is nonsense. You are both dying for each other.\"\n\n\"Then we must die. But as for that, I think that neither men nor\nyoung women die for love now-a-days. If we love each other, we must\ndo without each other, as people have to learn to do without most of\nthe things that they desire.\"\n\n\"I never heard of such nonsense, such wickedness! There is the money.\nWhy should you not take it?\"\n\n\"I can explain to you, mother,\" she said sternly, it being her wont\nto give the appellation but very seldom to her stepmother, \"why I\nshould not take Mr Owen, but I cannot tell you why I cannot take my\ncousin's money. I can only simply assure you that I will not do so,\nand that I most certainly shall never marry any man who would accept\nit.\"\n\n\"I consider that to be actual wickedness,--wickedness against your\nown father.\"\n\n\"I have told papa. He knows I will not have the money.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that you will come here into this house as an\nadditional burden, as a weight upon your poor father's shoulder, when\nyou have it in your power to relieve him altogether? Do you not know\nhow pressed he is, and that there are your brothers to be educated?\"\nIsabel, as she listened to this, sat silent, looking upon the ground,\nand her stepmother went on, understanding nothing of the nature of\nthe mind of her whom she was addressing. \"He had reason to expect,\nample reason, that you would never cost him a shilling. He had been\ntold a hundred times that you would be provided for by your uncle. Do\nyou not know that it was so?\"\n\n\"I do. I told him so myself when I was last here before Uncle\nIndefer's death.\"\n\n\"And yet you will do nothing to relieve him? You will refuse this\nmoney, though it is your own, when you could be married to Mr Owen\nto-morrow?\" Then she paused, waiting to find what might be the effect\nof her eloquence.\n\n\"I do not acknowledge papa's right or yours to press me to marry any\nman.\"\n\n\"But I suppose you acknowledge your right to be as good as your word?\nHere is the money; you have only got to take it.\"\n\n\"What you mean is that I ought to acknowledge my obligation to be as\ngood as my word. I do. I told my father that I would not be a burden\nto him, and I am bound to keep to that. He will have understood that\nat the present moment I am breaking my promise through a mistake of\nUncle Indefer's which I could not have anticipated.\"\n\n\"You are breaking your promise because you will not accept money that\nis your own.\"\n\n\"I am breaking my promise, and that is sufficient. I will go out of\nthe house and will cease to be a burden. If I only knew where I could\ngo, I would begin to-morrow.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" said Mrs Brodrick, getting up and bursting\nout of the room in anger. \"There is a man ready to marry you, and\nthere is the money. Anybody can see with half an eye what is your\nduty.\"\n\nIsabel, with all the eyes that she had, could not see what was her\nduty. That it could not be her duty to take a present of money from\nthe man whom she believed to be robbing her of the estate she felt\nquite sure. It could not be her duty to bring poverty on a man whom\nshe loved,--especially not as she had refused to confer wealth upon\nhim. It was, she thought, clearly her duty not to be a burden upon\nher father, as she had told him that no such burden should fall upon\nhim. It was her duty, she thought, to earn her own bread, or else to\neat none at all. In her present frame of mind she would have gone out\nof the house on the moment if any one would have accepted her even as\na kitchenmaid. But there was no one to accept her. She had questioned\nher father on the matter, and he had ridiculed her idea of earning\nher bread. When she had spoken of service, he had become angry with\nher. It was not thus that he could be relieved. He did not want to\nsee his girl a maid-servant or even a governess. It was not thus that\nshe could relieve him. He simply wanted to drive her into his views,\nso that she might accept the comfortable income which was at her\ndisposal, and become the wife of a gentleman whom every one esteemed.\nBut she, in her present frame of mind, cared little for any disgrace\nshe might bring on others by menial service. She was told that she\nwas a burden, and she desired to cease to be burdensome.\n\nThinking it over all that night, she resolved that she would consult\nMr Owen himself. It would, she thought, be easy,--or if not easy at\nany rate feasible,--to make him understand that there could be no\nmarriage. With him she would be on her own ground. He, at least,\nhad no authority over her, and she knew herself well enough to be\nconfident of her own strength. Her father had a certain right to\ninsist. Even her stepmother had a deputed right. But her lover had\nnone. He should be made to understand that she would not marry\nhim,--and then he could advise her as to that project of being\ngoverness, housemaid, schoolmistress, or what not.\n\nOn the following morning he came, and was soon closeted with her.\nWhen he arrived, Isabel was sitting with Mrs Brodrick and her\nsisters, but they soon packed up their hemmings and sewings, and took\nthemselves off, showing that it was an understood thing that Isabel\nand Mr Owen were to be left together. The door was no sooner closed\nthan he came up to her, as though to embrace her, as though to put\nan arm round her waist before she had a moment to retreat, preparing\nto kiss her as though she were already his own. She saw it all in a\nmoment. It was as though, since her last remembered interview, there\nhad been some other meeting which she had forgotten,--some meeting at\nwhich she had consented to be his wife. She could not be angry with\nhim. How can a girl be angry with a man whose love is so good, so\ntrue? He would not have dreamed of kissing her had she stood there\nbefore him the declared heiress of Llanfeare. She felt more than\nthis. She was sure by his manner that he knew that she had determined\nnot to take her cousin's money. She was altogether unaware that\nthere had already been some talking that morning between him and her\nfather; but she was sure that he knew. How could she be angry with\nhim?\n\nBut she escaped. \"No, not that,\" she said. \"It must not be so, Mr\nOwen;--it must not. It cannot be so.\"\n\n\"Tell me one thing, Isabel, before we go any further, and tell me\ntruly. Do you love me?\"\n\nShe was standing about six feet from him, and she looked hard into\nhis face, determined not to blush before his eyes for a moment. But\nshe could hardly make up her mind as to what would be the fitting\nanswer to his demand.\n\n\"I know,\" said he, \"that you are too proud to tell me a falsehood.\"\n\n\"I will not tell you a falsehood.\"\n\n\"Do you love me?\" There was still a pause. \"Do you love me as a woman\nshould love the man she means to marry?\"\n\n\"I do love you!\"\n\n\"Then, in God's name, why should we not kiss? You are my love and\nI am yours. Your father and mother are satisfied that it should be\nso. Seeing that we are so, is it a disgrace to kiss? Having won your\nheart, may I not have the delight of thinking that you would wish me\nto be near you?\"\n\n\"You must know it all,\" she said, \"though it may be unwomanly to tell\nso much.\"\n\n\"Know what?\"\n\n\"There has never been a man whose touch has been pleasant to me;--but\nI could revel in yours. Kiss you? I could kiss your feet at this\nmoment, and embrace your knees. Everything belonging to you is dear\nto me. The things you have touched have been made sacred to me. The\nPrayer-Book tells the young wife that she should love her husband\ntill death shall part them. I think my love will go further than\nthat.\"\n\n\"Isabel! Isabel!\"\n\n\"Keep away from me! I will not even give you my hand to shake till\nyou have promised to be of one mind with me. I will not become your\nwife.\"\n\n\"You shall become my wife!\"\n\n\"Never! Never! I have thought it out, and I know that I am right.\nThings have been hard with me.\"\n\n\"Not to me! They will not have been hard to me when I shall have\ncarried my point with you.\"\n\n\"I was forced to appear before your eyes as the heiress of my uncle.\"\n\n\"Has that made any difference with me?\"\n\n\"And I was forced to refuse you in obedience to him who had adopted\nme.\"\n\n\"I understand all that very completely.\"\n\n\"Then he made a new will, and left me some money.\"\n\n\"Of all that I know, I think, every particular.\"\n\n\"But the money is not there.\" At this he nodded his head as though\nsmiling at her absurdity in going back over circumstances which were\nso well understood by both of them. \"The money is offered to me by my\ncousin, but I will not take it.\"\n\n\"As to that I have nothing to say. It is the one point on which, when\nwe are married, I shall decline to give you any advice.\"\n\n\"Mr Owen,\" and now she came close to him, but still ready to spring\nback should it be necessary, \"Mr Owen, I will tell you what I have\ntold no one else.\"\n\n\"Why me?\"\n\n\"Because I trust you as I trust no one else.\"\n\n\"Then tell me.\"\n\n\"There is another will. There was another will rather, and he has\ndestroyed it.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that? You should not say that. You cannot know it.\"\n\n\"And, therefore, I say it only to you, as I would to my own heart.\nThe old man told me so--in his last moments. And then there is the\nlook of the man. If you could have seen how his craven spirit cowered\nbeneath my eyes!\"\n\n\"One should not judge by such indications. One cannot but see them\nand notice them; but one should not judge.\"\n\n\"You would have judged had you seen. You could not have helped\njudging. Nothing, however, can come of it, except this,--that not for\nall the world would I take his money.\"\n\n\"It may be right, Isabel, that all that should be discussed between\nyou and me,--right if you wish it. It will be my delight to think\nthat there shall be no secret between us. But, believe me, dearest,\nit can have no reference to the question between us.\"\n\n\"Not that I should be absolutely penniless?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"But it will, Mr Owen. In that even my father agrees with me.\" In\nthis she was no doubt wrong. Her father had simply impressed upon her\nthe necessity of taking the money because of her lover's needs. \"I\nwill not be a burden at any rate to you; and as I cannot go to you\nwithout being a burden, I will not go at all. What does it matter\nwhether there be a little more suffering or a little less? What does\nit matter?\"\n\n\"It matters a great deal to me.\"\n\n\"A man gets over that quickly, I think.\"\n\n\"So does a woman,--if she be the proper sort of woman for getting\nover her difficulties of that kind. I don't think you are.\"\n\n\"I will try.\"\n\n\"I won't.\" This he said, looking full into her face. \"My philosophy\nteaches me to despise the grapes which hang too high, but to make the\nmost of those which come within my reach. Now, I look upon you as\nbeing within my reach.\"\n\n\"I am not within your reach.\"\n\n\"Yes; pardon me for my confidence, but you are. You have confessed\nthat you love me.\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Then you will not be so wicked as to deny to me that which I have a\nright to demand? If you love me as a woman should love the man who is\nto become her husband, you have no right to refuse me. I have made\ngood my claim, unless there be other reasons.\"\n\n\"There is a reason.\"\n\n\"None but such as I have to judge of. Had your father objected, that\nwould have been a reason; or when your uncle disapproved because of\nthe property, that was a reason. As to the money, I will never ask\nyou to take it, unless you can plead that you yourself are afraid of\nthe poverty--.\" Then he paused, looking at her as though he defied\nher to say so much on her own behalf. She could not say that, but sat\nthere panting, frightened by his energy.\n\n\"Nor am I,\" he continued very gently, \"the least in the world. Think\nof it, and you will find that I am right; and then, when next I come,\nthen, perhaps, you will not refuse to kiss me.\" And so he went.\n\nOh, how she loved him! How sweet would it be to submit her pride,\nher independence, her maiden reticences to such a man as that! How\nworthy was he of all worship, of all confidence, of all service! How\ndefinitely better was he than any other being that had ever crossed\nher path! But yet she was quite sure that she would not marry him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThe _Carmarthen Herald_\n\n\nThere was a great deal said at Carmarthen about the old Squire's\nwill. Such scenes as that which had taken place in the house, first\nwhen the will was produced, then when the search was made, and\nafterwards when the will was read, do not pass without comment.\nThere had been many present, and some of them had been much moved by\nthe circumstances. The feeling that the Squire had executed a will\nsubsequent to that which had now been proved was very strong, and\nthe idea suggested by Mr Apjohn that the Squire himself had, in the\nweakness of his latter moments, destroyed this document, was not\ngenerally accepted. Had he done so, something of it would have been\nknown. The ashes of the paper or the tattered fragments would have\nbeen seen. Whether Mr Apjohn himself did or did not believe that it\nhad been so, others would not think it. Among the tenants and the\nservants at Llanfeare there was a general feeling that something\nwrong had been done. They who were most inclined to be charitable\nin their judgment, such as John Griffith of Coed, thought that the\ndocument was still hidden, and that it might not improbably be\nbrought to light at last. Others were convinced that it had fallen\ninto the hands of the present possessor of the property, and that it\nhad been feloniously but successfully destroyed. No guess at the real\ntruth was made by any one. How should a man have guessed that the\nfalse heir should have sat there with the will, as it were, before\nhis eyes, close at his hand, and neither have destroyed it nor\nrevealed its existence?\n\nAmong those who believed the worst as to Cousin Henry were the two\nCantors. When a man has seen a thing done himself he is prone to\nbelieve in it,--and the more so when he has had a hand in the doing.\nThey had been selected for the important operation of witnessing\nthe will, and did not in the least doubt that the will had been in\nexistence when the old Squire died. It might have been destroyed\nsince. They believed that it had been destroyed. But they could not\nbe brought to understand that so great an injustice should be allowed\nto remain on the face of the earth without a remedy or without\npunishment. Would it not be enough for a judge to know that they,\ntwo respectable men, had witnessed a new will, and that this new\nwill had certainly been in opposition to the one which had been so\nfraudulently proved? The younger Cantor especially was loud upon the\nsubject, and got many ears in Carmarthen to listen to him.\n\nThe _Carmarthen Herald_, a newspaper bearing a high character through\nSouth Wales, took the matter up very strongly, so that it became a\nquestion whether the new Squire would not be driven to defend himself\nby an action for libel. It was not that the writer declared that\nCousin Henry had destroyed the will, but that he published minute\naccounts of all that had been done at Llanfeare, putting forward in\nevery paper as it came out the reason which existed for supposing\nthat a wrong had been done. That theory that old Indefer Jones had\nhimself destroyed his last will without saying a word of his purpose\nto any one was torn to tatters. The doctor had been with him from day\nto day, and must almost certainly have known it had such an intention\nbeen in his mind. The housekeeper would have known it. The nephew\nand professed heir had said not a word to any one of what had passed\nbetween himself and his uncle. Could they who had known old Indefer\nJones for so many years, and were aware that he had been governed\nby the highest sense of honour through his entire life, could they\nbring themselves to believe that he should have altered the will made\nin his nephew's favour, and then realtered it, going back to his\nintentions in that nephew's favour, without saying a word to his\nnephew on the subject? But Henry Jones had been silent as to all\nthat occurred during those last weeks. Henry Jones had not only\nbeen silent when the will was being read, when the search was being\nmade, but had sat there still in continued silence. \"We do not say,\"\ncontinued the writer in the paper, \"that Henry Jones since he became\nowner of Llanfeare has been afraid to mingle with his brother men. We\nhave no right to say so. But we consider it to be our duty to declare\nthat such has been the fact. Circumstances will from time to time\noccur in which it becomes necessary on public grounds to inquire into\nthe privacy of individuals, and we think that the circumstances now\nas to this property are of this nature.\" As will be the case in such\nmatters, these expressions became gradually stronger, till it was\nconceived to be the object of those concerned in making them to drive\nHenry Jones to seek for legal redress,--so that he might be subjected\nto cross-examination as to the transactions and words of that last\nfortnight before his uncle's death. It was the opinion of many that\nif he could be forced into a witness-box, he would be made to confess\nif there were anything to confess. The cowardice of the man became\nknown,--or was rather exaggerated in the minds of those around him.\nIt was told of him how he lived in the one room, how rarely he left\nthe house, how totally he was without occupation. More than the truth\nwas repeated as to his habits, till all Carmarthenshire believed that\nhe was so trammelled by some mysterious consciousness of crime as to\nbe unable to perform any of the duties of life. When men spoke to him\nhe trembled; when men looked at him he turned away.\n\nAll his habits were inquired into. It was said of him that the\n_Carmarthen Herald_ was the only paper that he saw, and declared\nof him that he spent hour after hour in spelling the terrible\naccusations which, if not absolutely made against him, were\ninsinuated. It became clear to lawyers, to Mr Apjohn himself,\nthat the man, if honest, should, on behalf of the old family and\nlong-respected name, vindicate himself by prosecuting the owner of\nthe paper for libel. If he were honest in the matter, altogether\nhonest, there could be no reason why he should fear to encounter\na hostile lawyer. There were at last two letters from young\nJoseph Cantor printed in the paper which were undoubtedly\nlibellous,--letters which young Cantor himself certainly could not\nhave written,--letters which all Carmarthen knew to have been written\nby some one connected with the newspaper, though signed by the young\nfarmer,--in which it was positively declared that the old Squire had\nleft a later will behind him. When it was discussed whether or no\nhe could get a verdict, it was clearly shown that the getting of a\nverdict should not be the main object of the prosecution. \"He has\nto show,\" said Mr Apjohn, \"that he is not afraid to face a court of\njustice.\"\n\nBut he was afraid. When we last parted with him after his visit to\nCoed he had not seen the beginning of these attacks. On the next day\nthe first paper reached him, and they who were concerned in it did\nnot spare to send him the copies as they were issued. Having read\nthe first, he was not able to refuse to read what followed. In each\nissue they were carried on, and, as was told of him in Carmarthen, he\nlingered over every agonizing detail of the venom which was entering\ninto his soul. It was in vain that he tried to hide the paper, or to\npretend to be indifferent to its coming. Mrs Griffith knew very well\nwhere the paper was, and knew also that every word had been perused.\nThe month's notice which had been accepted from her and the butler in\nlieu of the three months first offered had now expired. The man had\ngone, but she remained, as did the two other women. Nothing was said\nas to the cause of their remaining; but they remained. As for Cousin\nHenry himself, he was too weak, too frightened, too completely\nabsorbed by the horrors of his situation to ask them why they stayed,\nor to have asked them why they went.\n\nHe understood every word that was written of him with sharp, minute\nintelligence. Though his spirit was cowed, his mind was still alive\nto all the dangers of his position. Things were being said of him,\ncharges were insinuated, which he declared to himself to be false. He\nhad not destroyed the will. He had not even hidden it. He had only\nput a book into its own place, carrying out as he did so his innocent\nintention when he had first lifted the book. When these searchers had\ncome, doing their work so idly, with such incurious futility, he had\nnot concealed the book. He had left it there on its shelf beneath\ntheir hands. Who could say that he had been guilty? If the will were\nfound now, who could reasonably suggest that there had been guilt on\nhis part? If all were known,--except that chance glance of his eye\nwhich never could be known,--no one could say that he was other than\ninnocent! And yet he knew of himself that he would lack strength to\nstand up in court and endure the sharp questions and angry glances\nof a keen lawyer. His very knees would fail to carry him through the\ncourt. The words would stick in his jaws. He would shake and shiver\nand faint before the assembled eyes. It would be easier for him to\nthrow himself from the rocks on which he had lain dreaming into the\nsea than to go into a court of law and there tell his own story as\nto the will. They could not force him to go. He thought he could\nperceive as much as that. The action, if action there were to be,\nmust originate with him. There was no evidence on which they could\nbring a charge of felony or even of fraud against him. They could\nnot drag him into the court. But he knew that all the world would\nsay that if he were an honest man, he himself would appear there,\ndenounce his defamers, and vindicate his own name. As day by day he\nfailed to do so, he would be declaring his own guilt. Yet he knew\nthat he could not do it.\n\nWas there no escape? He was quite sure now that the price at which he\nheld the property was infinitely above its value. Its value! It had\nno value in his eyes. It was simply a curse of which he would rid\nhimself with the utmost alacrity if only he could rid himself of all\nthat had befallen him in achieving it. But how should he escape? Were\nhe now himself to disclose the document and carry it into Carmarthen,\nprepared to deliver up the property to his cousin, was there one\nwho would not think that it had been in his possession from before\nhis uncle's death, and that he had now been driven by his fears to\nsurrender it? Was there one who would not believe that he had hidden\nit with his own hands? How now could he personate that magnanimity\nwhich would have been so easy had he brought forth the book and\nhanded it with its enclosure to Mr Apjohn when the lawyer came to\nread the will?\n\nHe looked back with dismay at his folly at having missed an\nopportunity so glorious. But now there seemed to be no escape. Though\nhe left the room daily, no one found the will. They were welcome to\nfind it if they would, but they did not. That base newspaper lied\nof him,--as he told himself bitterly as he read it,--in saying that\nhe did not leave his room. Daily did he roam about the place for an\nhour or two,--speaking, indeed, to no one, looking at no one. There\nthe newspaper had been true enough. But that charge against him\nof self-imprisonment had been false as far as it referred to days\nsubsequent to the rebuke which his housekeeper had given him. But\nno one laid a hand upon the book. He almost believed that, were the\npaper left open on the table, no eye would examine its contents.\nThere it lay still hidden within the folds of the sermon, that weight\nupon his heart, that incubus on his bosom, that nightmare which\nrobbed him of all his slumbers, and he could not rid himself of its\npresence. Property, indeed! Oh! if he were only back in London, and\nhis cousin reigning at Llanfeare!\n\nJohn Griffith, from Coed, had promised to call upon him; but when\nthree weeks had passed by, he had not as yet made his appearance.\nNow, on one morning he came and found his landlord alone in the\nbook-room. \"This is kind of you, Mr Griffith,\" said Cousin Henry,\nstruggling hard to assume the manner of a man with a light heart.\n\n\"I have come, Mr Jones,\" said the farmer very seriously, \"to say a\nfew words which I think ought to be said.\"\n\n\"What are they, Mr Griffith?\"\n\n\"Now, Mr Jones, I am not a man as is given to\ninterfering,--especially not with my betters.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are not.\"\n\n\"And, above all, not with my own landlord.\" Then he paused; but as\nCousin Henry could not find an appropriate word either for rebuke or\nencouragement, he was driven to go on with his story. \"I have been\nobliged to look at all those things in the _Carmarthen Herald_.\" Then\nCousin Henry turned deadly pale. \"We have all been driven to look\nat them. I have taken the paper these twenty years, but it is sent\nnow to every tenant on the estate, whether they pay or whether they\ndon't. Mrs Griffith, there, in the kitchen has it. I suppose they\nsent it to you, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes; it does come,\" said Cousin Henry, with the faintest attempt at\na smile.\n\n\"And you have read what they say?\"\n\n\"Yes, the most of it.\"\n\n\"It has been very hard, sir.\" At this Cousin Henry could only affect\na ghastly smile. \"Very hard,\" continued the farmer. \"It has made my\nflesh creep as I read it. Do you know what it all means, Mr Jones?\"\n\n\"I suppose I know.\"\n\n\"It means--that you have stolen--the estates--from your cousin--Miss\nBrodrick!\" This the man said very solemnly, bringing out each single\nword by itself. \"I am not saying so, Mr Jones.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" gasped the miserable wretch.\n\n\"No, indeed. If I thought so, I should not be here to tell you what\nI thought. It is because I believe that you are injured that I am\nhere.\"\n\n\"I am injured; I am injured!\"\n\n\"I think so. I believe so. I cannot tell what the mystery is, if\nmystery there be; but I do not believe that you have robbed that\nyoung lady, your own cousin, by destroying such a deed as your\nuncle's will.\"\n\n\"No, no, no.\"\n\n\"Is there any secret that you can tell?\"\n\nAwed, appalled, stricken with utter dismay, Cousin Henry sat silent\nbefore his questioner.\n\n\"If there be, sir, had you not better confide it to some one?\nYour uncle knew me well for more than forty years, and trusted me\nthoroughly, and I would fain, if I could, do something for his\nnephew. If there be anything to tell, tell it like a man.\"\n\nStill Cousin Henry sat silent. He was unable to summon courage at the\ninstant sufficient to deny the existence of the secret, nor could\nhe resolve to take down the book and show the document. He doubted,\nwhen the appearance of a doubt was in itself evidence of guilt in the\neyes of the man who was watching him. \"Oh, Mr Griffith,\" he exclaimed\nafter a while, \"will you be my friend?\"\n\n\"I will indeed, Mr Jones, if I can--honestly.\"\n\n\"I have been cruelly used.\"\n\n\"It has been hard to bear,\" said Mr Griffith.\n\n\"Terrible, terrible! Cruel, cruel!\" Then again he paused, trying to\nmake up his mind, endeavouring to see by what means he could escape\nfrom this hell upon earth. If there were any means, he might perhaps\nachieve it by aid of this man. The man sat silent, watching him, but\nthe way of escape did not appear to him.\n\n\"There is no mystery,\" he gasped at last.\n\n\"None?\" said the farmer severely.\n\n\"No mystery. What mystery should there be? There was the will. I\nhave destroyed nothing. I have hidden nothing. I have done nothing.\nBecause the old man changed his mind so often, am I to be blamed?\"\n\n\"Then, Mr Jones, why do you not say all that in a court of law,--on\nyour oath?\"\n\n\"How can I do that?\"\n\n\"Go to Mr Apjohn, and speak to him like a man. Bid him bring an\naction in your name for libel against the newspaper. Then there will\nbe an inquiry. Then you will be put into a witness-box, and be able\nto tell your own story on your oath.\"\n\nCousin Henry, groaning, pale and affrighted, murmured out something\nsignifying that he would think of it. Then Mr Griffith left him. The\nfarmer, when he entered the room, had believed his landlord to be\ninnocent, but that belief had vanished when he took his leave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nAn Action for Libel\n\n\nWhen the man had asked him that question,--Is there any secret you\ncan tell?--Cousin Henry did, for half a minute, make up his mind\nto tell the whole story, and reveal everything as it had occurred.\nThen he remembered the lie which he had told, the lie to which he\nhad signed his name when he had been called upon to prove the will\nin Carmarthen. Had he not by the unconsidered act of that moment\ncommitted some crime for which he could be prosecuted and sent\nto gaol? Had it not been perjury? From the very beginning he had\ndetermined that he would support his possession of the property by\nno criminal deed. He had not hidden the will in the book. He had\nnot interfered in the search. He had done nothing incompatible with\ninnocence. So it had been with him till he had been called upon,\nwithout a moment having been allowed to him for thinking, to sign his\nname to that declaration. The remembrance of this came to him as he\nalmost made up his mind to rise from his seat and pull the book down\nfrom the shelf. And then another thought occurred to him. Could he\nnot tell Mr Griffith that he had discovered the document since he\nhad made that declaration,--that he had discovered it only on that\nmorning? But he had felt that a story such as that would receive no\nbelief, and he had feared to estrange his only friend by a palpable\nlie. He had therefore said that there was no secret,--had said so\nafter a pause which had assured Mr Griffith of the existence of a\nmystery,--had said so with a face which of itself had declared the\ntruth.\n\nWhen the farmer left him he knew well enough that the man doubted\nhim,--nay, that the man was assured of his guilt. It had come to\nbe so with all whom he had encountered since he had first reached\nLlanfeare. His uncle who had sent for him had turned from him; his\ncousin had scorned him; the tenants had refused to accept him when\nthere certainly had been no cause for their rejection. Mr Apjohn from\nthe first had looked at him with accusing eyes; his servants were\nspies upon his actions; this newspaper was rending his very vitals;\nand now this one last friend had deserted him. He thought that if\nonly he could summon courage for the deed, it would be best for him\nto throw himself from the rocks.\n\nBut there was no such courage in him. The one idea remaining to\nhim was to save himself from the horrors of a criminal prosecution.\nIf he did not himself touch the document, or give any sign of his\nconsciousness of its presence, they could not prove that he had known\nof its whereabouts. If they would only find it and let him go! But\nthey did not find it, and he could not put them on its trace. As to\nthese wicked libels, Mr Griffith had asked him why he did not have\nrecourse to a court of law, and refute them by the courage of his\npresence. He understood the proposition in all its force. Why did he\nnot show himself able to bear any questions which the ingenuity of a\nlawyer could put to him? Simply because he was unable to bear them.\nThe truth would be extracted from him in the process. Though he\nshould have fortified himself with strongest resolves, he would be\nunable to hide his guilty knowledge. He knew that of himself. He\nwould be sure to give testimony against himself, on the strength of\nwhich he would be dragged from the witness-box to the dock.\n\nHe declared to himself that, let the newspaper say what it would,\nhe would not of his own motion throw himself among the lion's teeth\nwhich were prepared for him. But in so resolving he did not know\nwhat further external force might be applied to him. When the old\ntenant had sternly told him that he should go like a man into the\nwitness-box and tell his own story on his oath, that had been hard\nto bear. But there came worse than that,--a power more difficult to\nresist. On the following morning Mr Apjohn arrived at Llanfeare,\nhaving driven himself over from Carmarthen, and was at once shown\ninto the book-room. The lawyer was a man who, by his friends and by\nhis clients in general, was considered to be a pleasant fellow as\nwell as a cautious man of business. He was good at a dinner-table,\nserviceable with a gun, and always happy on horseback. He could\ncatch a fish, and was known to be partial to a rubber at whist. He\ncertainly was not regarded as a hard or cruel man. But Cousin Henry,\nin looking at him, had always seen a sternness in his eye, some curve\nof a frown upon his brow, which had been uncomfortable to him. From\nthe beginning of their intercourse he had been afraid of the lawyer.\nHe had felt that he was looked into and scrutinised, and found to\nbe wanting. Mr Apjohn had, of course, been on Isabel's side. All\nCarmarthenshire knew that he had done his best to induce the old\nsquire to maintain Isabel as his heiress. Cousin Henry was well aware\nof that. But still why had this attorney always looked at him with\naccusing eyes? When he had signed that declaration at Carmarthen, the\nattorney had shown by his face that he believed the declaration to be\nfalse. And now this man was there, and there was nothing for him but\nto endure his questions.\n\n\"Mr Jones,\" said the lawyer, \"I have thought it my duty to call upon\nyou in respect to these articles in the _Carmarthen Herald_.\"\n\n\"I cannot help what the _Carmarthen Herald_ may say.\"\n\n\"But you can, Mr Jones. That is just it. There are laws which enable\na man to stop libels and to punish them if it be worth his while\nto do so.\" He paused a moment, but Cousin Henry was silent, and he\ncontinued, \"For many years I was your uncle's lawyer, as was my\nfather before me. I have never been commissioned by you to regard\nmyself as your lawyer, but as circumstances are at present, I am\nobliged to occupy the place until you put your business into other\nhands. In such a position I feel it to be my duty to call upon you in\nreference to these articles. No doubt they are libellous.\"\n\n\"They are very cruel; I know that,\" said Cousin Henry, whining.\n\n\"All such accusations are cruel, if they be false.\"\n\n\"These are false; damnably false.\"\n\n\"I take that for granted; and therefore I have come to you to tell\nyou that it is your duty to repudiate with all the strength of your\nown words the terrible charges which are brought against you.\"\n\n\"Must I go and be a witness about myself?\"\n\n\"Yes; it is exactly that. You must go and be a witness about\nyourself. Who else can tell the truth as to all the matters in\nquestion as well as yourself? You should understand, Mr Jones,\nthat you should not take this step with the view of punishing the\nnewspaper.\"\n\n\"Why, then?\"\n\n\"In order that you may show yourself willing to place yourself there\nto be questioned. 'Here I am,' you would say. 'If there be any point\nin which you wish me to be examined as to this property and this\nwill, here I am to answer you.' It is that you may show that you are\nnot afraid of investigation.\" But it was exactly this of which Cousin\nHenry was afraid. \"You cannot but be aware of what is going on in\nCarmarthen.\"\n\n\"I know about the newspaper.\"\n\n\"It is my duty not to blink the matter. Every one, not only in the\ntown but throughout the country, is expressing an opinion that right\nhas not been done.\"\n\n\"What do they want? I cannot help it if my uncle did not make a will\naccording to their liking.\"\n\n\"They think that he did make a will according to their liking, and\nthat there has been foul play.\"\n\n\"Do they accuse me?\"\n\n\"Practically they do. These articles in the paper are only an echo of\nthe public voice. And that voice is becoming stronger and stronger\nevery day because you take no steps to silence it. Have you seen\nyesterday's paper?\"\n\n\"Yes; I saw it,\" said Cousin Henry, gasping for breath.\n\nThen Mr Apjohn brought a copy of the newspaper out of his pocket, and\nbegan to read a list of questions which the editor was supposed to\nask the public generally. Each question was an insult, and Cousin\nHenry, had he dared, would have bade the reader desist, and have\nturned him out of the room for his insolence in reading them.\n\n\"Has Mr Henry Jones expressed an opinion of his own as to what became\nof the will which the Messrs Cantor witnessed?\"\n\n\"Has Mr Henry Jones consulted any friend, legal or otherwise, as to\nhis tenure of the Llanfeare estate?\"\n\n\"Has Mr Henry Jones any friend to whom he can speak in\nCarmarthenshire?\"\n\n\"Has Mr Henry Jones inquired into the cause of his own isolation?\"\n\n\"Has Mr Henry Jones any idea why we persecute him in every fresh\nissue of our newspaper?\"\n\n\"Has Mr Henry Jones thought of what may possibly be the end of all\nthis?\"\n\n\"Has Mr Henry Jones any thought of prosecuting us for libel?\"\n\n\"Has Mr Henry Jones heard of any other case in which an heir has been\nmade so little welcome to his property?\"\n\nSo the questions went on, an almost endless list, and the lawyer read\nthem one after another, in a low, plain voice, slowly, but with clear\naccentuation, so that every point intended by the questioner might be\nunderstood. Such a martyrdom surely no man was ever doomed to bear\nbefore. In every line he was described as a thief. Yet he bore it;\nand when the lawyer came to an end of the abominable questions, he\nsat silent, trying to smile. What was he to say?\n\n\"Do you mean to put up with that?\" asked Mr Apjohn, with the curve of\nhis eyebrow of which Cousin Henry was so much afraid.\n\n\"What am I to do?\"\n\n\"Do! Do anything rather than sit in silence and bear such injurious\ninsult as that. Were there nothing else to do, I would tear the man's\ntongue from his mouth,--or at least his pen from his grasp.\"\n\n\"How am I to find him? I never did do anything of that rough kind.\"\n\n\"It is not necessary. I only say what a man would do if there were\nnothing else to be done. But the step to be taken is easy. Instruct\nme to go before the magistrates at Carmarthen, and indict the paper\nfor libel. That is what you must do.\"\n\nThere was an imperiousness in the lawyer's tone which was almost\nirresistible. Nevertheless Cousin Henry made a faint effort at\nresisting. \"I should be dragged into a lawsuit.\"\n\n\"A lawsuit! Of course you would. What lawsuit would not be preferable\nto that? You must do as I bid you, or you must consent to have it\nsaid and have it thought by all the country that you have been guilty\nof some felony, and have filched your cousin's property.\"\n\n\"I have committed nothing,\" said the poor wretch, as the tears ran\ndown his face.\n\n\"Then go and say so before the world,\" said the attorney, dashing his\nfist down violently upon the table. \"Go and say so, and let men hear\nyou, instead of sitting here whining like a woman. Like a woman! What\nhonest woman would ever bear such insult? If you do not, you will\nconvince all the world, you will convince me and every neighbour\nyou have, that you have done something to make away with that will.\nIn that case we will not leave a stone unturned to discover the\ntruth. The editor of that paper is laying himself open purposely\nto an action in order that he may force you to undergo the\ncross-questioning of a barrister, and everybody who hears of it says\nthat he is right. You can prove that he is wrong only by accepting\nthe challenge. If you refuse the challenge, as I put it to you now,\nyou will acknowledge that--that you have done this deed of darkness!\"\n\nWas there any torment ever so cruel, ever so unjustifiable as this!\nHe was asked to put himself, by his own act, into the thumbscrew, on\nthe rack, in order that the executioner might twist his limbs and\ntear out his vitals! He was to walk into a court of his own accord\nthat he might be torn by the practised skill of a professional\ntormentor, that he might be forced to give up the very secrets of his\nsoul in his impotence;--or else to live amidst the obloquy of all\nmen. He asked himself whether he had deserved it, and in that moment\nof time he assured himself that he had not deserved such punishment\nas this. If not altogether innocent, if not white as snow, he had\ndone nothing worthy of such cruel usage.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr Apjohn, as though demanding a final answer to his\nproposition.\n\n\"I will think of it,\" gasped Cousin Henry.\n\n\"There must be no more thinking. The time has gone by for thinking.\nIf you will give me your instructions to commence proceedings against\nthe _Carmarthen Herald_, I will act as your lawyer. If not, I shall\nmake it known to the town that I have made this proposition to you;\nand I shall also make known the way in which it has been accepted.\nThere has been more than delay enough.\"\n\nHe sobbed, and gasped, and struggled with himself as the lawyer sat\nand looked at him. The one thing on which he had been intent was the\navoiding of a court of law. And to this he was now to bring himself\nby his own act.\n\n\"When would it have to be?\" he asked.\n\n\"I should go before the magistrates to-morrow. Your presence would\nnot be wanted then. No delay would be made by the other side. They\nwould be ready enough to come to trial. The assizes begin here at\nCarmarthen on the 29th of next month. You might probably be examined\non that day, which will be a Friday, or on the Saturday following.\nYou will be called as a witness on your own side to prove the libel.\nBut the questions asked by your own counsel would amount to nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing!\" exclaimed Cousin Henry.\n\n\"You would be there for another purpose,\" continued the lawyer. \"When\nthat nothing had been asked, you would be handed over to the other\nside, in order that the object of the proceedings might be attained.\"\n\n\"What object?\"\n\n\"How the barrister employed might put it I cannot say, but he would\nexamine you as to any knowledge you may have as to that missing\nwill.\"\n\nMr Apjohn, as he said this, paused for a full minute, looking his\nclient full in the face. It was as though he himself were carrying\non a cross-examination. \"He would ask you whether you have such\nknowledge.\" Then again he paused, but Cousin Henry said nothing. \"If\nyou have no such knowledge, if you have no sin in that matter on your\nconscience, nothing to make you grow pale before the eyes of a judge,\nnothing to make you fear the verdict of a jury, no fault heavy on\nyour own soul,--then you may answer him with frank courage, then you\nmay look him in the face, and tell him with a clear voice that as far\nas you are aware your property is your own by as fair a title as any\nin the country.\"\n\nIn every word of this there had been condemnation. It was as though\nMr Apjohn were devoting him to infernal torture, telling him that his\nonly escape would be by the exercise of some herculean power which\nwas notoriously beyond his reach. It was evident to him that Mr\nApjohn had come there under the guise of his advisor and friend, but\nwas in fact leagued with all the others around him to drive him to\nhis ruin. Of that he felt quite sure. The voice, the eyes, the face,\nevery gesture of his unwelcome visitor had told him that it was so.\nAnd yet he could not rise in indignation and expel the visitor from\nhis house. There was a cruelty, an inhumanity, in this which to his\nthinking was infinitely worse than any guilt of his own. \"Well?\" said\nMr Apjohn.\n\n\"I suppose it must be so.\"\n\n\"I have your instructions, then?\"\n\n\"Don't you hear me say that I suppose it must be so.\"\n\n\"Very well. The matter shall be brought in proper course before the\nmagistrates to-morrow, and if, as I do not doubt, an injunction be\ngranted, I will proceed with the matter at once. I will tell you\nwhom we select as our counsel at the assizes, and, as soon as I have\nlearnt, will let you know whom they employ. Let me only implore you\nnot only to tell the truth as to what you know, but to tell all the\ntruth. If you attempt to conceal anything, it will certainly be\ndragged out of you.\"\n\nHaving thus comforted his client, Mr Apjohn took his leave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nCousin Henry Makes Another Attempt\n\n\nWhen Mr Apjohn had gone, Cousin Henry sat for an hour, not\nthinking,--men so afflicted have generally lost the power to\nthink,--but paralysed by the weight of his sorrow, simply repeating\nto himself assertions that said no man had ever been used so cruelly.\nHad he been as other men are, he would have turned the lawyer out of\nthe house at the first expression of an injurious suspicion, but his\nstrength had not sufficed for such action. He confessed to himself\nhis own weakness, though he could not bring himself to confess his\nown guilt. Why did they not find it and have done with it? Feeling\nat last how incapable he was of collecting his thoughts while he sat\nthere in the book-room, and aware, at the same time, that he must\ndetermine on some course of action, he took his hat and strolled out\ntowards the cliffs.\n\nThere was a month remaining to him, just a month before the day\nnamed on which he was to put himself into the witness-box. That, at\nany rate, must be avoided. He did after some fashion resolve that,\nlet the result be what it might, he would not submit himself to a\ncross-examination. They could not drag him from his bed were he to\nsay that he was ill. They could not send policemen to find him, were\nhe to hide himself in London. Unless he gave evidence against himself\nas to his own guilty knowledge, they could bring no open charge\nagainst him; or if he could but summon courage to throw himself from\noff the rocks, then, at any rate, he would escape from their hands.\n\nWhat was it all about? This he asked himself as he sat some way down\nthe cliff, looking out over the sea. What was it all about? If they\nwanted the property for his Cousin Isabel, they were welcome to\ntake it. He desired nothing but to be allowed to get away from this\naccursed country, to escape, and never more to be heard of there or\nto hear of it. Could he not give up the property with the signing of\nsome sufficient deed, and thus put an end to their cruel clamour?\nHe could do it all without any signing, by a simple act of honesty,\nby taking down the book with the will and giving it at once to the\nlawyer! It was possible,--possible as far as the knowledge of any one\nbut himself was concerned,--that such a thing might be done not only\nwith honesty, but with high-minded magnanimity. How would it be if\nin truth the document were first found by him on this very day? Had\nit been so, were it so, then his conduct would be honest. And it was\nstill open to him to simulate that it was so. He had taken down the\nbook, let him say, for spiritual comfort in his great trouble, and\nlo, the will had been found there between the leaves! No one would\nbelieve him. He declared to himself that such was already his\ncharacter in the county that no one would believe him. But what\nthough they disbelieved him? Surely they would accept restitution\nwithout further reproach. Then there would be no witness-box, no\nsavage terrier of a barrister to tear him in pieces with his fierce\nwords and fiercer eyes. Whether they believed him or not, they would\nlet him go. It would be told of him, at any rate, that having the\nwill in his hands, he had not destroyed it. Up in London, where men\nwould not know all the details of this last miserable month, some\ngood would be spoken of him. And then there would be time left to him\nto relieve his conscience by repentance.\n\nBut to whom should he deliver up the will, and how should he frame\nthe words? He was conscious of his own impotence in deceit. For such\na purpose Mr Apjohn, no doubt, would be the proper person, but there\nwas no one of whom he stood so much in dread as of Mr Apjohn. Were he\nto carry the book and the paper to the lawyer and attempt to tell his\nstory, the real truth would be drawn out from him in the first minute\nof their interview. The man's eyes looking at him, the man's brow\nbent against him, would extract from him instantly the one truth\nwhich it was his purpose to hold within his own keeping. He would\nfind no thankfulness, no mercy, not even justice in the lawyer. The\nlawyer would accept restitution, and would crush him afterwards.\nWould it not be better to go off to Hereford, without saying a word\nto any one in Carmarthenshire, and give up the deed to his Cousin\nIsabel? But then she had scorned him. She had treated him with foul\ncontempt. As he feared Mr Apjohn, so did he hate his Cousin Isabel.\nThe only approach to manliness left in his bosom was a true hatred of\nhis cousin.\n\nThe single voice which had been kind to him since he had come to this\nhorrid place had been that of old Farmer Griffith. Even his voice\nhad been stern at last, but yet, with the sternness, there had been\nsomething of compassion. He thought that he could tell the tale to Mr\nGriffith, if to any one. And so thinking, he resolved at once to go\nto Coed. There was still before him that other means of escape which\nthe rocks and the sea afforded him. As he had made his way on this\nmorning to the spot on which he was now lying that idea was still\npresent to him. He did not think that he could do a deed of such\ndaring. He was almost sure of himself that the power of doing it\nwould be utterly wanting when the moment came. But still it was\npresent to his mind. The courage might reach him at the instant. Were\na sudden impulse to carry him away, he thought the Lord would surely\nforgive him because of all his sufferings. But now, as he looked at\nthe spot, and saw that he could not reach the placid deep water, he\nconsidered it again, and remembered that the Lord would not forgive\nhim a sin as to which there would be no moment for repentance. As\nhe could not escape in that way, he must carry out his purpose with\nFarmer Griffith.\n\n\"So you be here again prowling about on father's lands?\"\n\nCousin Henry knew at once the voice of that bitter enemy of his,\nyoung Cantor; and, wretched as he was, he felt also something of the\nspirit of the landlord in being thus rebuked for trespassing on his\nground. \"I suppose I have a right to walk about on my own estate?\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"I know nothing about your own estate,\" replied the farmer's son.\n\"I say nothin' about that. They do be talking about it, but I say\nnothin'. I has my own opinions, but I say nothin'. Others do be\nsaying a great deal, as I suppose you hear, Mr Jones, but I say\nnothin'.\"\n\n\"How dare you be so impudent to your landlord?\"\n\n\"I know nothin' about landlords. I know father has a lease of this\nland, and pays his rent, whether you get it or another; and you\nhave no more right, it's my belief, to intrude here nor any other\nstranger. So, if you please, you'll walk.\"\n\n\"I shall stay here just as long as it suits me,\" said Cousin Henry.\n\n\"Oh, very well. Then father will have his action against you for\ntrespass, and so you'll be brought into a court of law. You are bound\nto go off when you are warned. You ain't no right here because you\ncall yourself landlord. You come up here and I'll thrash you, that's\nwhat I will. You wouldn't dare show yourself before a magistrate,\nthat's what you wouldn't.\"\n\nThe young man stood there for a while waiting, and then walked off\nwith a loud laugh.\n\nAny one might insult him, any one might beat him, and he could seek\nfor no redress because he would not dare to submit himself to the\nordeal of a witness-box. All those around him knew that it was so.\nHe was beyond the protection of the law because of the misery of his\nposition. It was clear that he must do something, and as he could not\ndrown himself, there was nothing better than that telling of his tale\nto Mr Griffith. He would go to Mr Griffith at once. He had not the\nbook and the document with him, but perhaps he could tell the tale\nbetter without their immediate presence.\n\nAt Coed he found the farmer in his own farmyard.\n\n\"I have come to you in great trouble,\" said Cousin Henry, beginning\nhis story.\n\n\"Well, squire, what is it?\" Then the farmer seated himself on a low,\nmovable bar which protected the entrance into an open barn, and\nCousin Henry sat beside him.\n\n\"That young man Cantor insulted me grossly just now.\"\n\n\"He shouldn't have done that. Whatever comes of it all, he shouldn't\nhave done that. He was always a forward young puppy.\"\n\n\"I do think I have been treated very badly among you.\"\n\n\"As to that, Mr Jones, opinion does run very high about the squire's\nwill. I explained to you all that when I was with you yesterday.\"\n\n\"Something has occurred since that,--something that I was coming on\npurpose to tell you.\"\n\n\"What has occurred?\" Cousin Henry groaned terribly as the moment for\nrevelation came upon him. And he felt that he had made the moment\naltogether unfit for revelation by that ill-judged observation as to\nyoung Cantor. He should have rushed at his story at once. \"Oh, Mr\nGriffith, I have found the will!\" It should have been told after that\nfashion. He felt it now,--felt that he had allowed the opportunity to\nslip by him.\n\n\"What is it that has occurred, Mr Jones, since I was up at Llanfeare\nyesterday?\"\n\n\"I don't think that I could tell you here.\"\n\n\"Where, then?\"\n\n\"Not yet to-day. That young man, Cantor, has so put me out that I\nhardly know what I am saying.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you speak it out, sir, if it's just something to be said?\"\n\n\"It's something to be shown too,\" replied Cousin Henry, \"and if you\nwouldn't mind coming up to the house to-morrow, or next day, then I\ncould explain it all.\"\n\n\"To-morrow it shall be,\" said the farmer. \"On the day after I shall\nbe in Carmarthen to market. If eleven o'clock to-morrow morning won't\nbe too early, I shall be there, sir.\"\n\nOne, or three, or five o'clock would have been better, or the day\nfollowing better still, so that the evil hour might have been\npostponed. But Cousin Henry assented to the proposition and took his\ndeparture. Now he had committed himself to some revelation, and the\nrevelation must be made. He felt acutely the folly of his own conduct\nduring the last quarter of an hour. If it might have been possible to\nmake the old man believe that the document had only been that morning\nfound, such belief could only have been achieved by an impulsive\ntelling of the story. He was aware that at every step he took he\ncreated fresh difficulties by his own folly and want of foresight.\nHow could he now act the sudden emotion of a man startled by\nsurprise? Nevertheless, he must go on with his scheme. There was\nnow nothing before him; but still he might be able to achieve\nthat purpose which he had in view of escaping from Llanfeare and\nCarmarthenshire.\n\nHe sat up late that night thinking of it. For many days past he had\nnot touched the volume, or allowed his eye to rest upon the document.\nHe had declared to himself that it might remain there or be taken\naway, as it might chance to others. It should no longer be anything\nto him. For aught that he knew, it might already have been removed.\nSuch had been his resolution during the last fortnight, and in\naccordance with that he had acted. But now his purpose was again\nchanged. Now he intended to reveal the will with his own hands, and\nit might be well that he should see that it was there.\n\nHe took down the book, and there it was. He opened it out, and\ncarefully read through every word of its complicated details. For it\nhad been arranged and drawn out in a lawyer's office, with all the\nlegal want of punctuation and unintelligible phraseology. It had\nbeen copied verbatim by the old Squire, and was no doubt a properly\nbinding and effective will. Never before had he dwelt over it so\ntediously. He had feared lest a finger-mark, a blot, or a spark might\nbetray his acquaintance with the deed. But now he was about to give\nit up and let all the world know that it had been in his hands. He\nfelt, therefore, that he was entitled to read it, and that there was\nno longer ground to fear any accident. Though the women in the house\nshould see him reading it, what matter?\n\nThrice he read it, sitting there late into the night. Thrice he read\nthe deed which had been prepared with such devilish industry to rob\nhim of the estate which had been promised him! If he had been wicked\nto conceal it,--no, not to conceal it, but only to be silent as to\nits whereabouts,--how much greater had been the sin of that dying old\nman who had taken so much trouble in robbing him? Now that the time\nhad come, almost the hour in which he had lately so truly loathed,\nthere came again upon him a love of money, a feeling of the privilege\nwhich attached to him as an owner of broad acres, and a sudden\nremembrance that with a little courage, with a little perseverance,\nwith a little power of endurance, he might live down the evils of\nthe present day. When he thought of what it might be to be Squire\nof Llanfeare in perhaps five years' time, with the rents in his\npocket, he became angry at his own feebleness. Let them ask him what\nquestions they would, there could be no evidence against him. If he\nwere to burn the will, there could certainly be no evidence against\nhim. If the will were still hidden, they might, perhaps, extract that\nsecret from him; but no lawyer would be strong enough to make him own\nthat he had thrust the paper between the bars of the fire.\n\nHe sat looking at it, gnashing his teeth together, and clenching his\nfists. If only he dared to do it! If only he could do it! He did\nduring a moment, make up his mind; but had no sooner done so than\nthere rose clearly before his mind's eye the judge and the jury, the\nparaphernalia of the court, and all the long horrors of a prison\nlife. Even now those prying women might have their eyes turned upon\nwhat he was doing. And should there be no women prying, no trial,\nno conviction, still there would be the damning guilt on his own\nsoul,--a guilt which would admit of no repentance except by giving\nhimself up to the hands of the law! No sooner had he resolved to\ndestroy the will than he was unable to destroy it. No sooner had he\nfelt his inability than again he longed to do the deed. When at three\no'clock he dragged himself up wearily to his bed, the will was again\nwithin the sermon, and the book was at rest upon its old ground.\n\nPunctually at eleven Mr Griffith was with him, and it was evident\nfrom his manner that he had thought the matter over, and was\ndetermined to be kind and gracious.\n\n\"Now, squire,\" said he, \"let us hear it; and I do hope it may be\nsomething that may make your mind quiet at last. You've had, I fear,\na bad time of it since the old squire died.\"\n\n\"Indeed I have, Mr Griffith.\"\n\n\"What is it now? Whatever it be, you may be sure of this, I will take\nit charitable like. I won't take nothing amiss; and if so be I can\nhelp you, I will.\"\n\nCousin Henry, as the door had been opened, and as the man's footstep\nhad been heard, had made up his mind that on this occasion he could\nnot reveal the secret. He had disabled himself by that unfortunate\nmanner of his yesterday. He would not even turn his eyes upon the\nbook, but sat looking into the empty grate. \"What is it, Mr Jones?\"\nasked the farmer.\n\n\"My uncle did make a will,\" said Cousin Henry feebly.\n\n\"Of course he made a will. He made a many,--one or two more than was\nwise, I am thinking.\"\n\n\"He made a will after the last one.\"\n\n\"After that in your favour?\"\n\n\"Yes; after that. I know that he did, by what I saw him doing; and so\nI thought I'd tell you.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"I thought I'd let you know that I was sure of it. What became of it\nafter it was made, that, you know, is quite another question. I do\nthink it must be in the house, and if so, search ought to be made.\nIf they believe there is such a will, why don't they come and search\nmore regularly? I shouldn't hinder them.\"\n\n\"Is that all you've got to say?\"\n\n\"As I have been thinking about it so much and as you are so kind to\nme, I thought I had better tell you.\"\n\n\"But there was something you were to show me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I did say so. If you will come upstairs, I'll point out the\nvery spot where the old man sat when he was writing it.\"\n\n\"There is nothing more than that?\"\n\n\"Nothing more than that, Mr Griffith.\"\n\n\"Then good morning, Mr Jones. I am afraid we have not got to the end\nof the matter yet.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nAgain at Hereford\n\n\nSome of the people at Carmarthen were taking a great deal of trouble\nabout the matter. One copy of the _Herald_ was sent regularly to\nMr Brodrick, another to Isabel, and another to Mr Owen. It was\ndetermined that they should not be kept in ignorance of what was\nbeing done. In the first number issued after Mr Apjohn's last visit\nto Llanfeare there was a short leading article recapitulating all\nthat was hitherto known of the story. \"Mr Henry Jones,\" said the\narticle in its last paragraph, \"has at length been induced to\nthreaten an action for libel against this newspaper. We doubt much\nwhether he will have the courage to go on with it. But if he does, he\nwill have to put himself into a witness-box, and then probably we may\nlearn something of the truth as to the last will and testament made\nby Mr Indefer Jones.\" All this reached Hereford, and was of course\ndeeply considered there by persons whom it concerned.\n\nMr Owen, for some days after the scene which has been described\nbetween him and Isabel, saw her frequently, and generally found means\nto be alone with her for some moments. She made no effort to avoid\nhim, and would fain have been allowed to treat him simply as her\ndearest friend. But in all these moments he treated her as though she\nwere engaged to be his wife. There was no embracing, no kiss. Isabel\nwould not permit it. But in all terms of affectionate expression he\nspoke of her and to her as though she were his own; and would only\ngently laugh at her when she assured him that it could never be so.\n\n\"Of course you can torment me a little,\" he said, smiling, \"but the\nforces arrayed against you are too strong, and you have not a chance\non your side. It would be monstrous to suppose that you should go on\nmaking me miserable for ever,--and yourself too.\"\n\nIn answer to this she could only say that she cared but little for\nher own misery, and did not believe in his. \"The question is,\" she\nsaid, \"whether it be fitting. As I feel that it is not fitting, I\ncertainly shall not do it.\" In answer to this he would again smile,\nand tell her that a month or two at furthest would see her absolutely\nconquered.\n\nThen the newspapers reached them. When it became clear to him that\nthere existed in Carmarthenshire so strong a doubt as to the validity\nof the will under which the property was at present held, then Mr\nOwen's visits to the house became rarer and different in their\nnature. Then he was willing to be simply the friend of the family,\nand as such he sought no especial interviews with Isabel. Between him\nand Isabel no word was spoken as to the contents of the newspaper.\nBut between Mr Brodrick and the clergyman many words were spoken. Mr\nBrodrick declared at once to his intended son-in-law his belief in\nthe accusations which were implied,--which were implied at first,\nbut afterwards made in terms so frightfully clear. When such words\nas those were said and printed there could, he urged, be no doubt as\nto what was believed in Carmarthen. And why should it be believed\nwithout ground that any man had done so hideous a deed as to destroy\na will? The lawyer's hair stood almost on end as he spoke of the\natrocity; but yet he believed it. Would a respectable newspaper such\nas the _Carmarthen Herald_ commit itself to such a course without the\nstrongest assurance? What was it to the _Carmarthen Herald_? Did not\nthe very continuance of the articles make it clear that the readers\nof the paper were in accordance with the writer? Would the public of\nCarmarthen sympathise in such an attack without the strongest ground?\nHe, the attorney, fully believed in Cousin Henry's guilt; but he was\nnot on that account sanguine as to the proof. If, during his sojourn\nat Llanfeare, either immediately before the old squire's death or\nafter it, but before the funeral, he had been enabled to lay his hand\nupon the will and destroy it, what hope would there be of evidence\nof such guilt? As to that idea of forcing the man to tell such a\ntale against himself by the torment of cross-examination, he did not\nbelieve it at all. A man who had been strong enough to destroy a will\nwould be too strong for that. Perhaps he thought that any man would\nbe too strong, not having known Cousin Henry. Among all the possible\nchances which occurred to his mind,--and his mind at this time was\ngreatly filled with such considerations,--nothing like the truth\nsuggested itself to him. His heart was tormented by the idea that\nthe property had been stolen from his child, that the glory of being\nfather-in-law to Llanfeare had been filched from himself, and that\nno hope for redress remained. He sympathised altogether with the\nnewspaper. He felt grateful to the newspaper. He declared the editor\nto be a man specially noble and brave in his calling. But he did not\nbelieve that the newspaper would do any good either to him or to\nIsabel.\n\nMr Owen doubted altogether the righteousness of the proceeding as\nregarded the newspaper. As far as he could see there was no evidence\nagainst Cousin Henry. There seemed to him to be an injustice in\naccusing a man of a great crime, simply because the crime might have\nbeen possible, and would, if committed, have been beneficial to the\ncriminal. That plan of frightening the man into self-accusation by\nthe terrors of cross-examination was distasteful to him. He would not\nsympathise with the newspaper. But still he found himself compelled\nto retreat from that affectation of certainty in regard to Isabel\nwhich he had assumed when he knew only that the will had been proved,\nand that Cousin Henry was in possession of the property. He had\nregarded Isabel and the property as altogether separated from each\nother. Now he learned that such was not the general opinion in\nCarmarthenshire. It was not his desire to push forward his suit\nwith the heiress of Llanfeare. He had been rejected on what he had\nacknowledged to be fitting grounds while that had been her position.\nWhen the matter had been altogether settled in Cousin Henry's favour,\nthen he could come forward again.\n\nIsabel was quite sure that the newspaper was right. Did she not\nremember the dying words with which her uncle had told her that\nhe had again made her his heir? And had she not always clearly\nin her mind the hang-dog look of that wretched man? She was\nstrong-minded,--but yet a woman, with a woman's propensity to follow\nher feelings rather than either facts or reason. Her lover had told\nher that her uncle had been very feeble when those words had been\nspoken, with his mind probably vague and his thoughts wandering.\nIt had, perhaps, been but a dream. Such words did not suffice as\nevidence on which to believe a man guilty of so great a crime. She\nknew,--so she declared to herself,--that the old man's words had\nnot been vague. And as to those hang-dog looks,--her lover had told\nher that she should not allow a man's countenance to go so far in\nevidence as that! In so judging she would trust much too far to her\nown power of discernment. She would not contradict him, but she felt\nsure of her discernment in that respect. She did not in the least\ndoubt the truth of the evidence conveyed by the man's hang-dog face.\n\nShe had sworn to herself a thousand times that she would not covet\nthe house and property. When her uncle had first declared to her his\npurpose of disinheriting her, she had been quite sure of herself that\nher love for him should not be affected by the change. It had been\nher pride to think that she could soar above any consideration of\nmoney and be sure of her own nobility, even though she should be\nstricken with absolute poverty. But now she was tempted to long that\nthe newspaper might be found to be right. Was there any man so fitted\nto be exalted in the world, so sure to fill a high place with honour,\nas her lover? Though she might not want Llanfeare for herself, was\nshe not bound to want it for his sake? He had told her how certain he\nwas of her heart,--how sure he was that sooner or later he would win\nher hand. She had almost begun to think that it must be so,--that her\nstrength would not suffice for her to hold to her purpose. But how\nsweet would be her triumph if she could turn to him and tell him that\nnow the hour had come in which she would be proud to become his wife!\n\"I love you well enough to rejoice in giving you something, but too\nwell to have been a burden on you when I could give you nothing.\"\nThat would be sweet to her! Then there should be kisses! As for\nCousin Henry, there was not even pity in her heart towards him. It\nwould be time to pity him when he should have been made to give up\nthe fruits of his wickedness and to confess his faults.\n\nMrs Brodrick was not made to understand the newspapers, nor did she\ncare much about the work which they had taken in hand. If Isabel\ncould be made to accept that smaller legacy, so that Mr Owen might\nmarry her out of hand and take her away, that would be enough to\nsatisfy Mrs Brodrick. If Isabel were settled somewhere with Mr Owen,\ntheir joint means being sufficient to make it certain that no calls\nwould be made on the paternal resources, that would satisfy Mrs\nBrodrick's craving in regard to the Welsh property. She was not sure\nthat she was anxious to see the half-sister of her own children\naltogether removed from their sphere and exalted so high. And then\nthis smaller stroke of good fortune might be so much more easily made\ncertain! A single word from Isabel herself, a word which any girl\nless endowed with wicked obstinacy would have spoken at once, would\nmake that sure and immediate. Whereas this great inheritance which\nwas to depend upon some almost impossible confession of the man who\nenjoyed it, seemed to her to be as distant as ever.\n\n\"Bother the newspapers,\" she said to her eldest daughter; \"why\ndoesn't she write and sign the receipt, and take her income like any\none else? She was getting new boots at Jackson's yesterday, and where\nis the money to come from? If any of you want new boots, papa is sure\nto tell me of it!\"\n\nHer spirit was embittered too by the severity of certain words which\nher husband had spoken to her. Isabel had appealed to her father when\nher step-mother had reproached her with being a burden in the house.\n\n\"Papa,\" she had said, \"let me leave the house and earn something. I\ncan at any rate earn my bread.\"\n\nThen Mr Brodrick had been very angry. He too had wished to accelerate\nthe marriage between his daughter and her lover, thinking that she\nwould surely accept the money on her lover's behalf. He too had been\nannoyed at the persistency of her double refusal. But it had been\nvery far from his purpose to drive his girl from his house, or to\nsubject her to the misery of such reproaches as his wife had cast\nupon her.\n\n\"My dear,\" he had said, \"there is no necessity for anything of the\nkind. I and your mother are only anxious for your welfare. I think\nthat you should take your uncle's money, if not for your own sake,\nthen for the sake of him to whom we all hope that you will soon be\nmarried. But putting that aside you are as well entitled to remain\nhere as your sisters, and, until you are married, here will be your\nhome.\"\n\nThere was comfort in this, some small comfort, but it did not tend\nto create pleasant intercourse between Isabel and her step-mother.\nMrs Brodrick was a woman who submitted herself habitually to her\nhusband, and intended to obey him, but one who nevertheless would\nnot be deterred from her own little purposes. She felt herself to be\nill-used by Isabel's presence in the house. Many years ago Isabel had\nbeen taken away, and she had been given to understand that Isabel\nwas removed for ever. There was to be no more expense, no more\ntrouble,--there should be no more jealousies in regard to Isabel.\nThe old uncle had promised to do everything, and that sore had been\nremoved from her life. Now Isabel had come back again, and insisted\non remaining there,--so unnecessarily! Now again there were those\nboots to be bought at Jackson's, and all those other increased\nexpenditures which another back, another head, another mouth, and\nanother pair of feet must create. And then it was so palpable that\nHereford thought much of Isabel, but thought little or nothing of\nher own girls. Such a one as Mrs Brodrick was sure to make herself\nunpleasant in circumstances such as these.\n\n\"Isabel,\" she said to her one day, \"I didn't say anything about you\nbeing turned out of the house.\"\n\n\"Who has said that you did, mother?\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have gone to your father and talked about going out as\na housemaid.\"\n\n\"I told papa that if he thought it right, I would endeavour to earn\nmy bread.\"\n\n\"You told him that I had complained about you being here.\"\n\n\"So you did. I had to tell him so, or I could not explain my purpose.\nOf course I am a burden. Every human being who eats and wears clothes\nand earns nothing is a burden. And I know that this is thought of the\nmore because it had been felt that I had been--been disposed of.\"\n\n\"You could be disposed of now, as you call it, if you pleased.\"\n\n\"But I do not please. That is a matter on which I will listen to\nno dictation. Therefore it is that I wish that I could go away and\nearn my own bread. I choose to be independent in that matter, and\ntherefore I ought to suffer for it. It is reasonable enough that I\nshould be felt to be a burden.\"\n\nThen the other girls came in, and nothing more was said till, after\nan hour or two, Mrs Brodrick and Isabel were again alone together.\n\n\"I do think it very odd that you cannot take that money; I certainly\ndo,\" said Mrs Brodrick.\n\n\"What is the use of going on about it? I shall not be made to take\nit.\"\n\n\"And all those people at Carmarthen so sure that you are entitled to\never so much more! I say nothing about burdens, but I cannot conceive\nhow you can reconcile it to your conscience when your poor papa has\ngot so many things to pay, and is so little able to pay them.\"\n\nThen she paused, but as Isabel would not be enticed into any further\ndeclaration of independence, she continued, \"It certainly is a\nsetting up of your own judgment against people who must know better.\nAs for Mr Owen, of course it will drive him to look for some one\nelse. The young man wants a wife, and of course he will find one.\nThen that chance will be lost.\"\n\nIn this way Isabel did not pass her time comfortably at Hereford.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nMr Cheekey\n\n\nA month had been left for Cousin Henry to consider what he would\ndo,--a month from the day in which he had been forced to accede to Mr\nApjohn's proposal up to that on which he would have to stand before\nthe barrister at Carmarthen, should he be brave enough at last to\nundergo the ordeal. He had in truth resolved that he would not\nundergo the ordeal. He was quite sure of himself that nothing short\nof cart-ropes or of the police would drag him into the witness-box.\nBut still there was the month. There were various thoughts filling\nhis mind. A great expense was being incurred,--most uselessly, if\nhe intended to retreat before the day came,--and who would pay the\nmoney? There was hardly a hope left in his bosom that the property\nwould remain in his hands. His hopes indeed now ran in altogether\nanother direction. In what way might he best get rid of the property?\nHow most readily might he take himself off from Llanfeare and have\nnothing more to do with the tenants and their rents? But still it\nwas he who would be responsible for this terrible expense. It had\nbeen explained to him by the lawyer, that he might either indict\nthe proprietor of the newspaper on a criminal charge or bring a\ncivil action against him for damages. Mr Apjohn had very strongly\nrecommended the former proceeding. It would be cheaper, he had\nsaid, and would show that the man who brought it had simply\nwished to vindicate his own character. It would be cheaper in the\nlong-run,--because, as the lawyer explained, it would not be so much\nhis object to get a verdict as to show by his presence in the court\nthat he was afraid of no one. Were he to sue for damages, and, as was\nprobable, not to get them, he must then bear the double expense of\nthe prosecution and defence. Such had been the arguments Mr Apjohn\nhad used; but he had considered also that if he could bind the man to\nprosecute the newspaper people on a criminal charge, then the poor\nvictim would be less able to retreat. In such case as that, should\nthe victim's courage fail him at the last moment, a policeman could\nbe made to fetch him and force him into the witness-box. But in the\nconduct of a civil action no such constraint could be put upon him.\nKnowing all this, Mr Apjohn had eagerly explained the superior\nattractions of a criminal prosecution, and Cousin Henry had fallen\ninto the trap. He understood it all now, but had not been ready\nenough to do so when the choice had been within his power. He had\nnow bound himself to prosecute, and certainly would be dragged into\nCarmarthen, unless he first made known the truth as to the will. If\nhe did that, then he thought that they would surely spare him the\ntrial. Were he to say to them, \"There; I have at last myself found\nthe will. Here, behold it! Take the will and take Llanfeare, and let\nme escape from my misery,\" then surely they would not force him to\nappear in reference to a matter which would have been already decided\nin their own favour. He had lost that opportunity of giving up the\nwill through Mr Griffith, but he was still resolved that some other\nmode must be discovered before the month should have run by. Every\nday was of moment, and yet the days passed on and nothing was done.\nHis last idea was to send the will to Mr Apjohn with a letter, in\nwhich he would simply declare that he had just found it amongst the\nsermons, and that he was prepared to go away. But as the days flew\nby the letter was left unwritten, and the will was still among the\nsermons.\n\nIt will be understood that all this was much talked of in Carmarthen.\nMr Henry Jones, of Llanfeare, was known to have indicted Mr Gregory\nEvans, of the _Carmarthen Herald_, for the publication of various\nwicked and malicious libels against himself; and it was known\nalso that Mr Apjohn was Mr Jones's attorney in carrying on the\nprosecution. But not the less was it understood that Mr Apjohn and Mr\nEvans were not hostile to each other in the matter. Mr Apjohn would\nbe quite honest in what he did. He would do his best to prove the\nlibel,--on condition that his client were the honest owner of the\nproperty in question. In truth, however, the great object of them all\nwas to get Henry Jones into a witness-box, so that, if possible, the\nvery truth might be extracted from him.\n\nDay by day and week by week since the funeral the idea had grown and\nbecome strong in Carmarthen that some wicked deed had been done. It\nirked the hearts of them all that such a one as Henry Jones should\ndo such a deed and not be discovered. Old Indefer Jones had been\nrespected by his neighbours. Miss Brodrick, though not personally\nwell known in the county, had been spoken well of by all men. The\nidea that Llanfeare should belong to her had been received with\nfavour. Then had come that altered intention in the old squire's\nmind, and the neighbours had disapproved. Mr Apjohn had disapproved\nvery strongly, and though he was not without that reticence so\nessentially necessary to the character of an attorney, his opinion\nhad become known. Then the squire's return to his old purpose was\nwhispered abroad. The Cantors had spoken very freely. Everything done\nand everything not done at Llanfeare was known in Carmarthen. Mr\nGriffith had at length spoken, being the last to abandon all hope as\nto Cousin Henry's honesty.\n\nEvery one was convinced that Cousin Henry had simply stolen the\nproperty; and was it to be endured that such a deed as that should\nhave been done by such a man and that Carmarthen should not find it\nout? Mr Apjohn was very much praised for his energy in having forced\nthe man to take his action against Mr Evans, and no one was more\ninclined to praise him than Mr Evans himself. Those who had seen the\nman did believe that the truth would be worked out of him; and those\nwho had only heard of him were sure that the trial would be a time of\nintense interest in the borough. The sale of the newspaper had risen\nimmensely, and Mr Evans was quite the leading man of the hour.\n\n\"So you are going to have Mr Balsam against me?\" said Mr Evans to Mr\nApjohn one day. Now Mr Balsam was a very respectable barrister, who\nfor many years had gone the Welsh circuit, and was chiefly known for\nthe mildness of his behaviour and an accurate knowledge of law,--two\ngifts hardly of much value to an advocate in an assize town.\n\n\"Yes, Mr Evans. Mr Balsam, I have no doubt, will do all that we\nwant.\"\n\n\"I suppose you want to get me into prison?\"\n\n\"Certainly, if it shall be proved that you have deserved it. The\nlibels are so manifest that it will be only necessary to read them to\na jury. Unless you can justify them, I think you will have to go to\nprison.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. You will come and see me, I am quite sure, Mr Apjohn.\"\n\n\"I suppose Mr Cheekey will have something to say on your behalf\nbefore it comes to that.\"\n\nNow Mr John Cheekey was a gentleman about fifty years of age, who had\nlately risen to considerable eminence in our criminal courts of law.\nHe was generally called in the profession,--and perhaps sometimes\noutside it,--\"Supercilious Jack,\" from the manner he had of moving\nhis eyebrows when he was desirous of intimidating a witness. He was\na strong, young-looking, and generally good-humoured Irishman, who\nhad a thousand good points. Under no circumstances would he bully a\nwoman,--nor would he bully a man, unless, according to his own mode\nof looking at such cases, the man wanted bullying. But when that time\ndid come,--and a reference to the Old Bailey and assize reports in\ngeneral would show that it came very often,--Supercilious Jack would\nmake his teeth felt worse than any terrier. He could pause in his\ncross-examination, look at a man, projecting his face forward by\ndegrees as he did so, in a manner which would crush any false witness\nwho was not armed with triple courage at his breast,--and, alas! not\nunfrequently a witness who was not false. For unfortunately, though\nMr Cheekey intended to confine the process to those who, as he said,\nwanted bullying, sometimes he made mistakes. He was possessed also of\nanother precious gift,--which, if he had not invented, he had brought\nto perfection,--that of bullying the judge also. He had found that by\ndoing so he could lower a judge in the estimation of the jury, and\nthus diminish the force of a damnatory charge. Mr Cheekey's services\nhad been especially secured for this trial, and all the circumstances\nhad been accurately explained to him. It was felt that a great day\nwould have arrived in Carmarthen when Mr Cheekey should stand up in\nthe court to cross-examine Cousin Henry.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr Evans, chuckling, \"I think that Mr Cheekey will have\nsomething to say to it. What will be the result, Mr Apjohn?\" he asked\nabruptly.\n\n\"How am I to say? If he can only hold his own like a man, there will,\nof course, be a verdict of guilty.\"\n\n\"But can he?\" asked he of the newspaper.\n\n\"I hope he may with all my heart,--if he have done nothing that he\nought not to have done. In this matter, Mr Evans, I have altogether a\ndivided sympathy. I dislike the man utterly. I don't care who knows\nit. No one knows it better than he himself. The idea of his coming\nhere over that young lady's head was from the first abhorrent to\nme. When I saw him, and heard him, and found out what he was,--such\na poor, cringing, cowardly wretch,--my feeling was of course\nexacerbated. It was terrible to me that the old squire, whom I had\nalways respected, should have brought such a man among us. But that\nwas the old squire's doing. He certainly did bring him, and as\ncertainly intended to make him his heir. If he did make him his heir,\nif that will which I read was in truth the last will, then I hope\nmost sincerely that all that Mr Cheekey may do may be of no avail\nagainst him. If that be the case, I shall be glad to have an\nopportunity of calling upon you in your new lodgings.\"\n\n\"But if there was another will, Mr Apjohn,--a later will?\"\n\n\"Then of course, there is the doubt whether this man be aware of it.\"\n\n\"But if he be aware of it?\"\n\n\"Then I hope that Mr Cheekey may tear him limb from limb.\"\n\n\"But you feel sure that it is so?\"\n\n\"Ah; I do not know about that. It is very hard to be sure of\nanything. When I see him I do feel almost sure that he is guilty; but\nwhen I think of it afterwards, I again have my doubts. It is not by\nmen of such calibre that great crimes are committed. I can hardly\nfancy that he should have destroyed a will.\"\n\n\"Or hidden it?\"\n\n\"If it were hidden, he would live in agony lest it were discovered. I\nused to think so when I knew that he passed the whole day sitting in\none room. Now he goes out for hours together. Two or three times he\nhas been down with old Griffith at Coed, and twice young Cantor found\nhim lying on the sea cliff. I doubt whether he would have gone so far\nafield if the will were hidden in the house.\"\n\n\"Can he have it on his own person?\"\n\n\"He is not brave enough for that. The presence of it there would\nreveal itself by the motion of his hands. His fingers would always be\non the pocket that contained it. I do not know what to think. And it\nis because I am in doubt that I have brought him under Mr Cheekey's\nthumbscrew. It is a case in which I would, if possible, force a man\nto confess the truth even against himself. And for this reason I\nhave urged him to prosecute you. But as an honest man myself, I am\nbound to hope that he may succeed if he be the rightful owner of\nLlanfeare.\"\n\n\"No one believes it, Mr Apjohn. Not one in all Carmarthen believes\nit.\"\n\n\"I will not say what I believe myself. Indeed I do not know. But I do\nhope that by Mr Cheekey's aid or otherwise we may get at the truth.\"\n\nIn his own peculiar circle, with Mr Geary the attorney, with Mr Jones\nthe auctioneer, and Mr Powell, the landlord of the Bush Hotel, Mr\nEvans was much more triumphant. Among them, and indeed, with the\ngentlemen of Carmarthen generally, he was something of a hero. They\ndid believe it probable that the interloper would be extruded from\nthe property which did not belong to him, and that the doing of this\nwould be due to Mr Evans. \"Apjohn pretends to think that it is very\ndoubtful,\" said he to his three friends.\n\n\"Apjohn isn't doubtful at all,\" said Mr Geary, \"but he is a little\ncautious as to expressing himself.\"\n\n\"Apjohn has behaved very well,\" remarked the innkeeper. \"If it wasn't\nfor him we should never have got the rascal to come forward at all.\nHe went out in one of my flies, but I won't let them charge for it on\na job like that.\"\n\n\"I suppose you'll charge for bringing Cousin Henry into the court,\"\nsaid the auctioneer. They had all got to call him Cousin Henry since\nthe idea had got abroad that he had robbed his Cousin Isabel.\n\n\"I'd bring him too for nothing, and stand him his lunch into the\nbargain, rather than that he shouldn't have the pleasure of meeting\nMr Cheekey.\"\n\n\"Cheekey will get it out of him, if there is anything to get,\" said\nMr Evans.\n\n\"My belief is that Mr Cheekey will about strike him dumb. If he has\ngot anything in his bosom to conceal, he will be so awe-struck that\nhe won't be able to open his mouth. He won't be got to say he did it,\nbut he won't be able to say he didn't.\" This was Mr Geary's opinion.\n\n\"What would that amount to?\" asked Mr Powell. \"I'm afraid they\ncouldn't give the place back to the young lady because of that.\"\n\n\"The jury would acquit Mr Evans. That's about what it would amount\nto,\" said the attorney.\n\n\"And Cousin Henry would go back to Llanfeare, and have all his\ntroubles over,\" remarked Mr Jones. This they deemed to be a\ndisastrous termination to all the trouble which they were taking, but\none which seemed by no means improbable.\n\nThey all agreed that even Mr Cheekey would hardly be able to extract\nfrom the man an acknowledgment that he had with his own hands\ndestroyed the will. Such a termination as that to a cross-examination\nhad never been known under the hands of the most expert of advocates.\nThat Cousin Henry might be stricken dumb, that he might faint, that\nhe might be committed for contempt of court,--all these events were\npossible, or perhaps, not impossible; but that he should say, \"Yes, I\ndid it, I burnt the will. Yes, I, with my own hands,\"--that they all\ndeclared to be impossible. And, if so, Cousin Henry would go back\nagain to Llanfeare confirmed in his possession of the property.\n\n\"He will only laugh at us in his sleeve when it is over,\" said the\nauctioneer.\n\nThey little knew the torments which the man was enduring, or how\nunlikely it was that he should laugh in his sleeve at any one. We are\ntoo apt to forget when we think of the sins and faults of men how\nkeen may be their conscience in spite of their sins. While they were\nthus talking of Cousin Henry, he was vainly endeavouring to console\nhimself with the reflection that he had not committed any great\ncrime, that there was still a road open to him for repentance, that\nif only he might be allowed to escape and repent in London, he would\nbe too glad to resign Llanfeare and all its glories. The reader will\nhardly suppose that Cousin Henry will return after the trial to laugh\nin his sleeve in his own library in his own house.\n\nA few days afterwards Mr Apjohn was up in town and had an interview\nwith Mr Balsam, the barrister. \"This client of mine does not seem to\nbe a nice sort of country gentleman,\" said Mr Balsam.\n\n\"Anything but that. You will understand, Mr Balsam, that my only\nobject in persuading him to indict the paper has been to put him into\na witness-box. I told him so, of course. I explained to him that\nunless he would appear there, he could never hold up his head.\"\n\n\"And he took your advice.\"\n\n\"Very unwillingly. He would have given his right hand to escape. But\nI gave him no alternative. I so put it before him that he could not\nrefuse to do as I bade him without owning himself to be a rascal.\nShall I tell you what I think will come of it?\"\n\n\"What will come of it?\"\n\n\"He will not appear. I feel certain that he will not have the courage\nto show himself in the court. When the day comes, or, perhaps, a day\nor two before, he will run away.\"\n\n\"What will you do then?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's the question. What shall we do then? He is bound to\nprosecute, and will have to pay the penalty. In such a case as this\nI think we could have him found and brought into court for the next\nassizes. But what could we do then? Though we were ever so rough to\nhim in the way of contempt of court and the rest of it, we cannot\ntake the property away. If he has got hold of the will and destroyed\nit, or hidden it, we can do nothing as to the property as long as he\nis strong enough to hold his tongue. If he can be made to speak, then\nI think we shall get at it.\"\n\nMr Balsam shook his head. He was quite willing to believe that his\nclient was as base as Mr Apjohn represented him to be; but he was\nnot willing to believe that Mr Cheekey was as powerful as had been\nassumed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nCousin Henry Goes to Carmarthen\n\n\nOn his return from London Mr Apjohn wrote the following letter to his\nclient, and this he sent to Llanfeare by a clerk, who was instructed\nto wait there for an answer:--\n\n\n   MY DEAR SIR,--\n\n   I have just returned from London, where I saw Mr Balsam,\n   who will be employed on your behalf at the assizes. It is\n   necessary that you should come into my office, so that I\n   may complete the instructions which are to be given to\n   counsel. As I could not very well do this at Llanfeare\n   without considerable inconvenience, I must give you this\n   trouble. My clerk who takes this out to you will bring\n   back your answer, saying whether eleven in the morning\n   to-morrow or three in the afternoon will best suit your\n   arrangements. You can tell him also whether you would wish\n   me to send a fly for you. I believe that you still keep\n   your uncle's carriage, in which case it would perhaps be\n   unnecessary. A message sent by the clerk will suffice, so\n   that you may be saved the trouble of writing.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   NICHOLAS APJOHN.\n\n\nThe clerk had made his way into the book-room in which Cousin Henry\nwas sitting, and stood there over him while he was reading the\nletter. He felt sure that it had been arranged by Mr Apjohn that it\nshould be so, in order that he might not have a moment to consider\nthe reply which he would send. Mr Apjohn had calculated, traitor that\nhe was to the cause of his client,--so thought Cousin Henry,--that\nthe man's presence would rob him of his presence of mind so as to\nprevent him from sending a refusal.\n\n\"I don't see why I should go into Carmarthen at all,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, sir, it's quite essential,--altogether essential in a case such\nas this. You are bound to prosecute, and of course you must give your\ninstructions. If Mr Apjohn were to bring everything out here for the\npurpose, the expense would be tremendous. In going there, it will\nonly be the fly, and it will all be done in five minutes.\"\n\n\"Who will be there?\" asked Cousin Henry after a pause.\n\n\"I shall be there,\" answered the clerk, not unnaturally putting\nhimself first, \"and Mr Apjohn, and perhaps one of the lads.\"\n\n\"There won't be any--barrister?\" asked Cousin Henry, showing the\nextent of his fear by his voice and his countenance.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no; they won't be here till the assizes. A barrister never\nsees his own client. You'll go in as a witness, and will have nothing\nto do with the barristers till you're put up face to face before them\nin the witness-box. Mr Balsam is a very mild gentleman.\"\n\n\"He is employed by me?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; he's on our side. His own side never matters much to a\nwitness. It's when the other side tackles you!\"\n\n\"Who is the other side?\" asked Cousin Henry.\n\n\"Haven't you heard?\" The voice in which this was said struck terror\nto the poor wretch's soul. There was awe in it and pity, and\nsomething almost of advice,--as though the voice were warning him to\nprepare against the evil which was threatening him. \"They have got Mr\nCheekey!\" Here the voice became even more awful. \"I knew they would\nwhen I first heard what the case was to be. They've got Mr Cheekey.\nThey don't care much about money when they're going it like that.\nThere are many of them I have known awful enough, but he's the\nawfullest.\"\n\n\"He can't eat a fellow,\" said Cousin Henry, trying to look like a man\nwith good average courage.\n\n\"No; he can't eat a fellow. It isn't that way he does it. I've known\nsome of 'em who looked as though they were going to eat a man; but he\nlooks as though he were going to skin you, and leave you bare for the\nbirds to eat you. He's gentle enough at first, is Mr Cheekey.\"\n\n\"What is it all to me?\" asked Cousin Henry.\n\n\"Oh, nothing, sir. To a gentleman like you who knows what he's about\nit's all nothing. What can Mr Cheekey do to a gentleman who has got\nnothing to conceal? But when a witness has something to hide,--and\nsometimes there will be something,--then it is that Mr Cheekey comes\nout strong. He looks into a man and sees that it's there, and then he\nturns him inside out till he gets at it. That's what I call skinning\na witness. I saw a poor fellow once so knocked about by Mr Cheekey\nthat they had to carry him down speechless out of the witness-box.\"\n\nIt was a vivid description of all that Cousin Henry had pictured to\nhimself. And he had actually, by his own act, subjected himself to\nthis process! Had he been staunch in refusing to bring any action\nagainst the newspaper, Mr Cheekey would have been powerless in\nreference to him. And now he was summoned into Carmarthen to prepare\nhimself by minor preliminary pangs for the torture of the auto-da-f\u00c3\u00a9\nwhich was to be made of him.\n\n\"I don't see why I should go into Carmarthen at all,\" he said, having\npaused a while after the eloquent description of the barrister's\npowers.\n\n\"Not come into Carmarthen! Why, sir, you must complete the\ninstructions.\"\n\n\"I don't see it at all.\"\n\n\"Then do you mean to back out of it altogether, Mr Jones? I wouldn't\nbe afeared by Mr Cheekey like that!\"\n\nThen it occurred to him that if he did mean to back out of it\naltogether he could do so better at a later period, when they might\nhardly be able to catch him by force and bring him as a prisoner\nbefore the dreaded tribunal. And as it was his purpose to avoid the\ntrial by giving up the will, which he would pretend to have found at\nthe moment of giving it up, he would ruin his own project,--as he\nhad done so many projects before,--by his imbecility at the present\nmoment. Cheekey would not be there in Mr Apjohn's office, nor the\njudge and jury and all the crowd of the court to look at him.\n\n\"I don't mean to back out at all,\" he said; \"and it's very\nimpertinent of you to say so.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean impertinence, Mr Jones;--only it is necessary you\nshould come into Mr Apjohn's office.\"\n\n\"Very well; I'll come to-morrow at three.\"\n\n\"And about the fly, Mr Jones?\"\n\n\"I can come in my own carriage.\"\n\n\"Of course. That's what Mr Apjohn said. But if I may make so bold, Mr\nJones,--wouldn't all the people in Carmarthen know the old Squire's\ncarriage?\"\n\nHere was another trouble. Yes; all the people in Carmarthen would\nknow the old Squire's carriage, and after all those passages in the\nnewspapers,--believing, as he knew they did, that he had stolen the\nproperty,--would clamber up on the very wheels to look at him! The\nclerk had been right in that.\n\n\"I don't mean it for any impertinence, Mr Jones; but wouldn't it be\nbetter just to come in and to go out quiet in one of Mr Powell's\nflies?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Cousin Henry. \"Let the fly come.\"\n\n\"I thought it would be best,\" said the clerk, taking cowardly\nadvantage of his success over the prostrate wretch. \"What's the use\nof a gentleman taking his own carriage through the streets on such an\noccasion as this? They are so prying into everything in Carmarthen.\nNow, when they see the Bush fly, they won't think as anybody\nparticular is in it.\" And so it was settled. The fly should be at\nLlanfeare by two o'clock on the following day.\n\nOh, if he could but die! If the house would fall upon him and crush\nhim! There had not been a word spoken by that reptile of a clerk\nwhich he had not understood,--not an arrow cast at him the sting of\nwhich did not enter into his very marrow! \"Oh, nothing, sir, to a\ngentleman like you.\" The man had looked at him as he had uttered the\nwords with a full appreciation of the threat conveyed. \"They've got\na rod in pickle for you,--for you, who have stolen your cousin's\nestate! Mr Cheekey is coming for you!\" That was what the miscreant\nof a clerk had said to him. And then, though he had found himself\ncompelled to yield to that hint about the carriage, how terrible\nwas it to have to confess that he was afraid to be driven through\nCarmarthen in his own carriage!\n\nHe must go into Carmarthen and face Mr Apjohn once again. That was\nclear. He could not now send the will in lieu of himself. Why had he\nnot possessed the presence of mind to say to the clerk at once that\nno further steps need be taken? \"No further steps need be taken. I\nhave found the will. Here it is. I found it this very morning among\nthe books. Take it to Mr Apjohn, and tell him I have done with\nLlanfeare and all its concerns.\" How excellent would have been the\nopportunity! And it would not have been difficult for him to act his\npart amidst the confusion to which the clerk would have been brought\nby the greatness of the revelation made to him. But he had allowed\nthe chance to pass, and now he must go into Carmarthen!\n\nAt half-past two the following day he put himself into the fly.\nDuring the morning he had taken the will out of the book, determined\nto carry it with him to Carmarthen in his pocket. But when he\nattempted to enclose it in an envelope for the purpose, his mind\nmisgave him and he restored it. Hateful as was the property to him,\nodious as were the house and all things about it, no sooner did the\ndoing of the act by which he was to release himself from them come\nwithin the touch of his fingers, than he abandoned the idea. At such\nmoments the estate would again have charms for him, and he would\nremember that such a deed, when once done, would admit of no recall.\n\n\"I am glad to see you, Mr Jones,\" said the attorney as his client\nentered the inner office. \"There are a few words which must be\nsettled between you and me before the day comes, and no time has\nto be lost. Sit down, Mr Ricketts, and write the headings of the\nquestions and answers. Then Mr Jones can initial them afterwards.\"\n\nMr Ricketts was the clerk who had come out to Llanfeare. Cousin Henry\nsat silent as Mr Ricketts folded his long sheet of folio paper with\na double margin. Here was a new terror to him; and as he saw the\npreparations he almost made up his mind that he would on no account\nsign his name to anything.\n\nThe instructions to be given to Mr Balsam were in fact very simple,\nand need not here be recapitulated. His uncle had sent for him to\nLlanfeare, had told him that he was to be the heir, had informed him\nthat a new will had been made in his favour. After his uncle's death\nand subsequent to the funeral, he had heard a will read, and under\nthat will had inherited the property. As far as he believed, or\nat any rate as far as he knew, that was his uncle's last will and\ntestament. These were the instructions which, under Mr Apjohn's\nadvice, were to be given to Mr Balsam as to his (Cousin Henry's)\ndirect evidence.\n\nThen Cousin Henry, remembering his last communication to Farmer\nGriffith, remembering also all that the two Cantors could prove,\nadded something on his own account.\n\n\"I saw the old man writing up in his room,\" he said, \"copying\nsomething which I knew to be a will. I was sure then he was going to\nmake another change and take the property from me.\" \"No; I asked him\nno questions. I thought it very cruel, but it was of no use for me to\nsay anything.\" \"No; he didn't tell me what he was about; but I knew\nit was another will. I wouldn't condescend to ask a question. When\nthe Cantors said that they had witnessed a will, I never doubted\nthem. When you came there to read the will, I supposed it would be\nfound. Like enough it's there now, if proper search were made. I can\ntell all that to Mr Balsam if he wants to know it.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me all this before?\" said Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"It isn't much to tell. It's only what I thought. If what the Cantors\nsaid and what you all believed yourselves didn't bring you to the\nwill, nothing I could say would help you. It doesn't amount to more\nthan thinking after all.\"\n\nThen Mr Apjohn was again confused and again in doubt. Could it be\npossible after all that the conduct on the part of the man which had\nbeen so prejudicial to him in the eyes of all men had been produced\nsimply by the annoyances to which he had been subjected? It was still\npossible that the old man had himself destroyed the document which\nhe had been tempted to make, and that they had all of them been most\nunjust to this poor fellow. He added, however, all the details of\nthis new story to the instructions which were to be given to Mr\nBalsam, and to which Cousin Henry did attach his signature.\n\nThen came some further conversation about Mr Cheekey, which, however,\ndid not take an official form. What questions Mr Cheekey might ask\nwould be between Mr Cheekey and the other attorney, and formed no\npart of Mr Apjohn's direct business. He had intended to imbue his\nclient with something of the horror with which his clerk had been\nbefore him in creating, believing that the cause of truth would\nbe assisted by reducing the man to the lowest condition of mean\nterror. But this new story somewhat changed his purpose. If the\nman were innocent,--if there were but some small probability of\nhis innocence,--was it not his duty to defend him as a client from\nill-usage on the part of Cheekey? That Cheekey must have his way with\nhim was a matter of course,--that is, if Cousin Henry appeared at\nall; but a word or two of warning might be of service.\n\n\"You will be examined on the other side by Mr Cheekey,\" he said,\nintending to assume a pleasant voice. At the hearing of the awful\nname, sweat broke out on Cousin Henry's brow. \"You know what his line\nwill be?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it.\"\n\n\"He will attempt to prove that another will was made.\"\n\n\"I do not deny it. Haven't I said that I think another will was\nmade?\"\n\n\"And that you are either aware of its existence--\" here Mr Apjohn\npaused, having resumed that stern tone of his voice which was so\ndisagreeable to Cousin Henry's ears--\"or that you have destroyed it.\"\n\n\"What right has he got to say that I have destroyed it? I have\ndestroyed nothing.\"\n\nMr Apjohn marked the words well, and was again all but convinced\nthat his client was not innocent. \"He will endeavour to make a jury\nbelieve from words coming out of your own mouth, or possibly by your\nsilence, that you have either destroyed the deed,--or have concealed\nit.\"\n\nCousin Henry thought a moment whether he had concealed the will or\nnot. No! he had not put it within the book. The man who hides a thing\nis the man who conceals the thing,--not a man who fails to tell that\nhe has found it.\n\n\"Or--concealed it,\" repeated Mr Apjohn with that peculiar voice of\nhis.\n\n\"I have not concealed it,\" said the victim.\n\n\"Nor know where it lies hidden?\" Ghastly pale he became,--livid,\nalmost blue by degrees. Though he was fully determined to give up the\nwill, he could not yield to the pressure now put upon him. Nor could\nhe withstand it. The question was as terrible to him as though he had\nentertained no idea of abandoning the property. To acknowledge that\nhe knew all along where it was hidden would be to confess his guilt\nand to give himself up to the tormentors of the law.\n\n\"Nor know where it lies hidden?\" repeated Mr Apjohn, in a low voice.\n\"Go out of the room, Ricketts,\" he said. \"Nor know where it lies\nhidden?\" he asked a third time when the clerk had closed the door\nbehind him.\n\n\"I know nothing about it,\" gasped the poor man.\n\n\"You have nothing beyond that to say to me?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"You would rather that it should be left to Mr Cheekey? If there be\nanything further that you can say, I should be more tender with you\nthan he.\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"And here, in this room, there is no public to gaze upon you.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he gasped again.\n\n\"Very well. So be it. Ricketts, see if the fly be there for Mr\nJones.\" A few minutes afterwards his confidential clerk was alone\nwith him in the room.\n\n\"I have learned so much, Ricketts,\" said he. \"The will is still in\nexistence. I am sure of that. And he knows its whereabouts. We shall\nhave Miss Brodrick there before Christmas yet.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nMr Apjohn Sends for Assistance\n\n\nThe last words in the last chapter were spoken by Mr Apjohn to his\nconfidential clerk in a tone of triumph. He had picked up something\nfurther, and, conscious that he had done so by his own ingenuity,\nwas for a moment triumphant. But when he came to think over it all\nalone,--and he spent many hours just at present in thinking of this\nmatter,--he was less inclined to be self-satisfied. He felt that a\ngreat responsibility rested with him, and that this weighed upon\nhim peculiarly at the present moment. He was quite sure not only\nthat a later will had been made, but that it was in existence. It\nwas concealed somewhere, and Cousin Henry knew the secret of its\nhiding-place. It had existed, at any rate, that morning; but now came\nthe terrible question whether the man, driven to his last gasp in his\nmisery, would not destroy it. Not only had Mr Apjohn discovered the\nsecret, but he was well aware that Cousin Henry was conscious that he\nhad done so, and yet not a word had been spoken between them which,\nshould the will now be destroyed, could be taken as evidence that it\nhad ever existed. Let the paper be once burnt, and Cousin Henry would\nbe safe in possession of the property. Mr Cheekey might torment his\nvictim, but certainly would not extract from him a confession such as\nthat. The hiding of the will, the very place in which it was hidden,\nmight possibly be extracted. It was conceivable that ingenuity on\none side and abject terror on the other might lead a poor wretch to\nbetray the secret; but a man who has committed a felony will hardly\nconfess the deed in a court of law. Something of all this would,\nthought Mr Apjohn, occur to Cousin Henry himself, and by this very\naddition to his fears he might be driven to destroy the will. The\ngreat object now should be to preserve a document which had lived as\nit were a charmed life through so many dangers. If anything were to\nbe done with this object,--anything new,--it must be done at once.\nEven now, while he was thinking of it, Cousin Henry was being taken\nslowly home in Mr Powell's fly, and might do the deed as soon as\nhe found himself alone in the book-room. Mr Apjohn was almost\nsure that the will was concealed somewhere in the book-room. That\nlong-continued sojourn in the chamber, of which the whole country had\nheard so much, told him that it was so. He was there always, watching\nthe hiding-place. Would it be well that searchers should again be\nsent out, and that they should be instructed never to leave that room\ntill after Cousin Henry's examination should be over? If so, it would\nbe right that a man should be sent off instantly on horseback, so as\nto prevent immediate destruction. But then he had no power to take\nsuch a step in reference to another man's house. It was a question\nwhether any magistrate would give him such a warrant, seeing that\nsearch had already been made, and that, on the failure of such\nsearch, that Squire's will had already been proved. A man's house\nis his castle, let the suspicion against him be what it may, unless\nthere be evidence to support it. Were he to apply to a magistrate, he\ncould only say that the man's own manner and mode of speech had been\nevidence of his guilt. And yet how much was there hanging, perhaps,\non the decision of the moment! Whether the property should go to\nthe hands of her who was entitled to enjoy it, or remain in the\npossession of a thief such as this, might so probably depend on the\naction which should be taken, now, at this very instant!\n\nMr Ricketts, his confidential clerk, was the only person with whom\nhe had fully discussed all the details of the case,--the only person\nto whom he had expressed his own thoughts as they had occurred to\nhim. He had said a word to the clerk in triumph as Cousin Henry left\nhim, but a few minutes afterwards recalled him with an altered tone.\n\"Ricketts,\" he said, \"the man has got that will with him in the\nbook-room at Llanfeare.\"\n\n\"Or in his pocket, sir,\" suggested Ricketts.\n\n\"I don't think it. Wherever it be at this moment, he has not placed\nit there himself. The Squire put it somewhere, and he has found it.\"\n\n\"The Squire was very weak when he made that will, sir,\" said the\nclerk. \"Just at that time he was only coming down to the dining-room,\nwhen the sun shone in just for an hour or two in the day. If he put\nthe will anywhere, it would probably be in his bed-room.\"\n\n\"The man occupies another chamber?\" asked the attorney.\n\n\"Yes, sir; the same room he had before his uncle died.\"\n\n\"It's in the book-room,\" repeated Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"Then he must have put it there.\"\n\n\"But he didn't. From his manner, and from a word or two that he\nspoke, I feel sure that the paper has been placed where it is by\nother hands.\"\n\n\"The old man never went into the book-room. I heard every detail of\nhis latter life from Mrs Griffith when the search was going on. He\nhadn't been there for more than a month. If he wanted anything out of\nthe book-room, after the young lady went away, he sent Mrs Griffith\nfor it.\"\n\n\"What did he send for?\" asked Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"He used to read a little sometimes,\" said the clerk.\n\n\"Sermons?\" suggested Mr Apjohn. \"For many years past he has read\nsermons to himself whenever he has failed in going to church. I have\nseen the volumes there on the table in the parlour when I have been\nwith him. Did they search the books?\"\n\n\"Had every volume off the shelves, sir.\"\n\n\"And opened every one of them?\"\n\n\"That I can't tell. I wasn't there.\"\n\n\"Every volume should have been shaken,\" said Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"It's not too late yet, sir,\" said the clerk.\n\n\"But how are we to get in and do it? I have no right to go into his\nhouse, or any man's, to search it.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't dare to hinder you, sir.\"\n\nThen there was a pause before anything further was said.\n\n\"The step is such a strong one to take,\" said the lawyer, \"when one\nis guided only by one's own inner conviction. I have no tittle of\nevidence in my favour to prove anything beyond the fact that the old\nSquire in the latter days of his life did make a will which has not\nbeen found. For that we have searched, and, not finding it, have been\nforced to admit to probate the last will which we ourselves made.\nSince that nothing has come to my knowledge. Guided partly by the\nman's ways while he has been at Llanfeare, and partly by his own\nmanner and hesitation, I have come to a conclusion in my own mind;\nbut it is one which I would hardly dare to propose to a magistrate as\na ground for action.\"\n\n\"But if he consented, sir?\"\n\n\"Still, I should be hardly able to justify myself for such intrusion\nif nothing were found. We have no right to crush the poor creature\nbecause he is so easily crushable. I feel already pricks of\nconscience because I am bringing down Jack Cheekey upon him. If it\nall be as I have suggested,--that the will is hidden, let us say in\nsome volume of sermons there,--what probability is there that he will\ndestroy it now?\"\n\n\"He would before the trial, I think.\"\n\n\"But not at once? I think not. He will not allow himself to be driven\nto the great crime till the last moment. It is quite on the cards\nthat his conscience will even at last be too strong for it.\"\n\n\"We owe him something, sir, for not destroying it when he first found\nit.\"\n\n\"Not a doubt! If we are right in all this, we do owe him\nsomething,--at any rate, charity enough to suppose that the doing of\nsuch a deed must be very distasteful to him. When I think of it I\ndoubt whether he'll do it at all.\"\n\n\"He asked me why they didn't come and search again.\"\n\n\"Did he? I shouldn't wonder if the poor devil would be glad enough to\nbe relieved from it all. I'll tell you what I'll do, Ricketts. I'll\nwrite to Miss Brodrick's father, and ask him to come over here before\nthe trial. He is much more concerned in the matter than I am, and\nshould know as well what ought to be done.\"\n\nThe letter was written urging Mr Brodrick to come at once. \"I have\nno right to tell you,\" Mr Apjohn said in his letter, \"that there is\nground for believing that such a document as that I have described\nis still existing. I might too probably be raising false hope were I\nto do so. I can only tell you of my own suspicion, explaining to you\nat the same time on what ground it is founded. I think it would be\nwell that you should come over and consult with me whether further\nsteps should be taken. If so, come at once. The trial is fixed for\nFriday the 30th.\" This was written on Thursday the 22nd. There was,\ntherefore, not much more than a week's interval.\n\n\"You will come with me,\" said Mr Brodrick to the Rev. William Owen,\nafter showing to him the letter from the attorney at Hereford.\n\n\"Why should I go with you?\"\n\n\"I would wish you to do so--on Isabel's behalf.\"\n\n\"Isabel and I are nothing to each other.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear you say that. It was but the other day that you\ndeclared that she should be your wife in spite of herself.\"\n\n\"So she shall, if Mr Henry Jones be firmly established at Llanfeare.\nIt was explained to me before why your daughter, as owner of\nLlanfeare, ought not to marry me, and, as I altogether agreed with\nthe reason given, it would not become me to take any step in this\nmatter. As owner of Llanfeare she will be nothing to me. It cannot\ntherefore be right that I should look after her interests in that\ndirection. On any other subject I would do anything for her.\"\n\nThe father no doubt felt that the two young people were self-willed,\nobstinate, and contradictory. His daughter wouldn't marry the\nclergyman because she had been deprived of her property. The\nclergyman now refused to marry his daughter because it was presumed\nthat her property might be restored to her. As, however, he could\nnot induce Mr Owen to go with him to Carmarthen, he determined to go\nalone. He did not give much weight to this new story. It seemed to\nhim certain that the man would destroy the will,--or would already\nhave destroyed it,--if in the first instance he was wicked enough\nto conceal it. Still the matter was so great and the question so\nimportant to his daughter's interest that he felt himself compelled\nto do as Mr Apjohn had proposed. But he did not do it altogether as\nMr Apjohn had proposed. He allowed other matters to interfere, and\npostponed his journey till Tuesday the 27th of the month. Late on\nthat evening he reached Carmarthen, and at once went to Mr Apjohn's\nhouse.\n\nCousin Henry's journey into Carmarthen had been made on the previous\nThursday, and since that day no new steps had been taken to unravel\nthe mystery,--none at least which had reference to Llanfeare. No\nfurther search had been made among the books. All that was known in\nCarmarthen of Cousin Henry during these days was that he remained\naltogether within the house. Were he so minded, ample time was\nallowed to him for the destruction of any document. In the town,\npreparation went on in the usual way for the assizes, at which\nthe one case of interest was to be the indictment of Mr Evans for\ndefamation of character. It was now supposed by the world at large\nthat Cousin Henry would come into court; and because this was\nbelieved of him there was something of a slight turn of public\nopinion in his favour. It would hardly be the case that the man, if\nreally guilty, would encounter Mr Cheekey.\n\nDuring the days that had elapsed, even Mr Apjohn himself had lost\nsomething of his confidence. If any further step was to be taken, why\ndid not the young lady's father himself come and take it? Why had he\nbeen so dilatory in a matter which was of so much greater importance\nto himself than to any one else? But now the two attorneys were\ntogether, and it was necessary that they should decide upon doing\nsomething,--or nothing.\n\n\"I hoped you would have been here last week,\" said Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"I couldn't get away. There were things I couldn't possibly leave.\"\n\n\"It is so important,\" said Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"Of course it is important,--of most vital importance,--if there be\nany hope.\"\n\n\"I have told you exactly what I think and feel.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. I know how much more than kind, how honourable you have\nbeen in all this matter. You still think that the will is hidden?\"\n\n\"I did think so.\"\n\n\"Something has changed your opinion?\"\n\n\"I can hardly say that either,\" said Mr Apjohn. \"There was ground on\nwhich to form my opinion, and I do not know that there is any ground\nfor changing it. But in such a matter the mind will vacillate. I did\nthink that he had found the will shut up in a volume of sermons, in a\nvolume which his uncle had been reading during his illness, and that\nhe had left the book in its place upon the shelf. That, you will say,\nis a conclusion too exact for man to reach without anything in the\nshape of absolute evidence.\"\n\n\"I do not say so; but then as yet I hardly know the process by which\nthat belief has been reached.\"\n\n\"But I say so;--I say that is too exact. There is more of imagination\nin it than of true deduction. I certainly should not recommend\nanother person to proceed far on such reasoning. You see it has\nbeen in this way.\" Then he explained to his brother attorney the\nprocess of little circumstances by which he had arrived at his own\nopinion;--the dislike of the man to leave the house, his clinging\nto one room, his manifest possession of a secret as evinced by his\nconversations with Farmer Griffith, his continual dread of something,\nhis very clinging to Llanfeare as a residence which would not have\nbeen the case had he destroyed the will, his exaggerated fear of the\ncoming cross-examination, his ready assertion that he had destroyed\nnothing and hidden nothing,--but his failure to reply when he was\nasked whether he was aware of any such concealment. Then the fact\nthat the books had not been searched themselves, that the old Squire\nhad never personally used the room, but had used a book or one or two\nbooks which had been taken from it; that these books had been volumes\nwhich had certainly been close to him in those days when the lost\nwill was being written. All these and other little details known to\nthe reader made the process by which Mr Apjohn had arrived at the\nconclusion which he now endeavoured to explain to Mr Brodrick.\n\n\"I grant that the chain is slight,\" said Mr Apjohn, \"so slight that a\nfeather may break it. The strongest point in it all was the look on\nthe man's face when I asked him the last question. Now I have told\nyou everything, and you must decide what we ought to do.\"\n\nBut Mr Brodrick was a man endowed with lesser gifts than those of the\nother attorney. In such a matter Mr Apjohn was sure to lead. \"What do\nyou think yourself?\"\n\n\"I would propose that we, you and I, should go together over to\nLlanfeare to-morrow and ask him to allow us to make what further\nsearch we may please about the house. If he permitted this--\"\n\n\"But would he?\"\n\n\"I think he would. I am not at all sure but what he would wish to\nhave the will found. If he did, we could begin and go through every\nbook in the library. We would begin with the sermons, and soon know\nwhether it be as I have suggested.\"\n\n\"But if he refused?\"\n\n\"Then I think I would make bold to insist on remaining there while\nyou went to a magistrate. I have indeed already prepared Mr Evans of\nLlancolly, who is the nearest magistrate. I would refuse to leave\nthe room, and you would then return with a search warrant and a\npoliceman. But as for opening the special book or books, I could do\nthat with or without his permission. While you talk to him I will\nlook round the room and see where they are. I don't think much of it\nall, Mr Brodrick; but when the stake is so high, it is worth playing\nfor. If we fail in this, we can then only wait and see what the\nredoubtable Mr Cheekey may be able to do for us.\"\n\nThus it was settled that Mr Brodrick and Mr Apjohn should go out to\nLlanfeare on the following morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nDoubts\n\n\n\"I  know  nothing  about  it,\" Cousin Henry had gasped out when asked\nby Mr Apjohn, when Ricketts, the clerk, had left the room, whether\nhe knew where the will was hidden. Then, when he had declared he had\nnothing further to say, he was allowed to go away.\n\nAs he was carried back in the fly he felt certain that Mr Apjohn\nknew that there had been a will, knew that the will was still in\nexistence, knew that it had been hidden by some accident, and knew\nalso that he, Henry Jones, was aware of the place of concealment.\nThat the man should have been so expert in reading the secret of his\nbosom was terrible to him. Had the man suspected him of destroying\nthe will,--a deed the doing of which might have been so naturally\nsuspected,--that would have been less terrible. He had done nothing,\nhad committed no crime, was simply conscious of the existence of a\npaper which it was a duty, not of him, but of others to find, and\nthis man, by his fearful ingenuity, had discovered it all! Now it was\nsimply necessary that the place should be indicated, and in order\nthat he himself might be forced to indicate it, Mr Cheekey was to be\nlet loose upon him!\n\nHow impossible,--how almost impossible had he found it to produce a\nword in answer to that one little question from Mr Apjohn! \"Nor know\nwhere it is hidden?\" He had so answered it as to make it manifest\nthat he did know. He was conscious that he had been thus weak, though\nthere had been nothing in Mr Apjohn's manner to appal him. How would\nit be with him when, hour after hour, question after question should\nbe demanded of him, when that cruel tormentor should stand there\nglaring at him in presence of all the court? There would be no need\nof such hour,--no need of that prolonged questioning. All that was\nwanted of him would be revealed at once. The whole secret would be\nscrewed out of him by the first turn of the tormentor's engine.\n\nThere was but one thing quite fixed in his mind. Nothing should\ninduce him to face Mr Cheekey, unless he should have made himself\ncomparatively safe by destroying the will. In that way he almost\nthought he might be safe. The suffering would be great. The rack and\nthe thumbscrew, the boots and the wheel, would, to the delight of all\nthose present, be allowed to do their work upon him for hours. It\nwould be a day to him terrible to anticipate, terrible to endure,\nterrible afterwards in his memory; but he thought that not even Mr\nCheekey himself would be able to extract from him the admission of\nsuch a deed as that.\n\nAnd then by the deed he would undoubtedly acquire Llanfeare. The\nplace itself was not dear to him, but there was rising in his heart\nso strong a feeling of hatred against those who were oppressing him\nthat it seemed to him almost a duty to punish them by continued\npossession of the property. In this way he could triumph over them\nall. If once he could come down from Mr Cheekey's grasp alive, if he\ncould survive those fearful hours, he would walk forth from the court\nthe undoubted owner of Llanfeare. It would be as though a man should\nendure some excruciating operation under the hands of a surgeon, with\nthe assured hope that he might enjoy perfect health afterwards for\nthe remainder of his life.\n\nTo destroy the will was his only chance of escape. There was nothing\nelse left to him, knowing, as he did, that it was impossible for him\nto put an end to his own life with his own hands. These little plots\nof his, which he had planned for the revelation of his secret without\nthe acknowledgment of guilt, had all fallen to pieces as he attempted\nto execute them. He began to be aware of himself that anything that\nrequired skill in the execution was impossible to him. But to burn\nthe will he was capable. He could surely take the paper from its\nhiding-place and hold it down with the poker when he had thrust it\nbetween the bars. Or, as there was no fire provided in these summer\nmonths, he could consume it by the light of his candle when the\ndead hours of the night had come upon him. He had already resolved\nthat, when he had done so, he would swallow the tell-tale ashes. He\nbelieved of himself that all that would be within his power, if only\nhe could determine upon the doing of it.\n\nAnd he thought that the deed when done would give him a new courage.\nThe very danger to which he would have exposed himself would make\nhim brave to avoid it. Having destroyed the will, and certain that\nno eye had seen him, conscious that his safety depended on his own\nreticence, he was sure that he would keep his secret even before Mr\nCheekey.\n\n\"I know nothing of the will,\" he would say; \"I have neither seen it,\nnor hidden it, nor found it, nor destroyed it.\"\n\nKnowing what would be the consequences were he to depart from the\nassertion, he would assuredly cling to it. He would be safer then,\nmuch safer than in his present vacillating, half-innocent position.\n\nAs he was carried home in the fly, his mind was so intent upon this,\nhe was so anxious to resolve to bring himself to do the deed, that he\nhardly knew where he was when the fly stopped at his hall door. As\nhe entered his house, he stared about him as though doubtful of his\nwhereabouts, and then, without speaking a word, made his way into the\nbook-room, and seated himself on his accustomed chair. The woman came\nto him and asked him whether money should not be given to the driver.\n\n\"What driver?\" said he. \"Let him go to Mr Apjohn. It is Mr Apjohn's\nbusiness, not mine.\" Then he got up and shut the door violently as\nthe woman retreated.\n\nYes; it was Mr Apjohn's business; and he thought that he could put a\nspoke into the wheel of Mr Apjohn's business. Mr Apjohn was not only\nanxious to criminate him now, but had been anxious when such anxiety\non his part had been intrusive and impertinent. Mr Apjohn had, from\nfirst to last, been his enemy, and by his enmity had created that\nfatal dislike which his uncle had felt for him. Mr Apjohn was now\ndetermined to ruin him. Mr Apjohn had come out to him at Llanfeare,\npretending to be his lawyer, his friend, his advisor, and had\nrecommended this treacherous indictment merely that he might be able\nto subject him to the torments of Mr Cheekey's persecution. Cousin\nHenry could see it all now! So, at least, Cousin Henry told himself.\n\n\"He is a clever fellow, and he thinks that I am a fool. Perhaps he is\nright, but he will find that the fool has been too many for him.\"\n\nIt was thus that he communed with himself.\n\nHe had his dinner and sat by himself during the whole evening, as had\nbeen his practice every day since his uncle's death. But yet this\npeculiar night seemed to him to be eventful. He felt himself to be\nlifted into some unwonted eagerness of life, something approaching\nto activity. There was a deed to be done, and though he was not as\nyet doing it, though he did not think that he intended to do it that\nvery night, yet the fact that he had made up his mind made him in\nsome sort aware that the dumb spirit which would not speak had been\nexorcised, and that the crushing dullness of the latter days had\npassed away from him. No; he could not do it that night; but he was\nsure that he would do it. He had looked about for a way of escape,\nand had been as though a dead man while he could not find it. He had\nlived in terror of Mrs Griffith the housekeeper, of Farmer Griffith,\nof the two Cantors, of Mr Apjohn, of that tyrant Cheekey, of his own\nshadow,--while he and that will were existing together in the same\nroom. But it should be so no longer. There was one way of escape, and\nhe would take it!\n\nThen he went on thinking of what good things might be in store for\nhim. His spirit had hitherto been so quenched by the vicinity of the\nwill that he had never dared to soar into thoughts of the enjoyment\nof money. There had been so black a pall over everything that he had\nnot as yet realised what it was that Llanfeare might do for him. Of\ncourse he could not live there. Though he should have to leave the\nhouse untenanted altogether, it would matter but little. There was no\nlaw to make a man live on his own estate. He calculated that he would\nbe able to draw \u00c2\u00a31500 a year from the property;--\u00c2\u00a31500 a year! That\nwould be clearly his own; on which no one could lay a finger; and\nwhat enjoyment could he not buy with \u00c2\u00a31500 a year?\n\nWith a great resolve to destroy the will he went to bed, and slept\nthrough the night as best he could. In the dark of his chamber, when\nthe candle was out, and he was not yet protected by his bed, there\ncame a qualm upon him. But the deed was not yet done, and the qualm\nwas kept under, and he slept. He even repeated the Lord's Prayer to\nhimself when he was under the clothes, struggling, however, as he did\nso, not to bring home to himself that petition as to the leading into\ntemptation and the deliverance from evil.\n\nThe next day, the Friday, and the Saturday were passed in the same\nway. The resolution was still there, but the qualms came every night.\nAnd the salve to the qualm was always the same remembrance that the\ndeed had not been done yet. And the prayer was always said, morning\nand night, with the same persistent rejection of those words which,\nin his present condition, were so damning to him,--rejection from the\nintelligence though with the whispering voice the words were spoken.\nBut still there was the resolve the same as ever. There was no other\nway of escape. A stag, when brought to bay, will trample upon the\nhounds. He would trample upon them. Llanfeare should all be his\nown. He would not return to his clerk's desk to be the scorn of all\nmen,--to have it known that he had fraudulently kept the will hidden,\nand then revealed it, not of grace, but because he was afraid of Mr\nCheekey. His mind was quite made up. But the deed need not be yet\ndone. The fewer nights that he would have to pass in that house,\nafter the doing of the deed, the better.\n\nThe trial was to be on the Friday. He would not postpone the deed\ntill the last day, as it might be then that emissaries might come to\nhim, watching him to see that he did not escape. And yet it would be\nwell for him to keep his hands clean from the doing of it up to the\nlast moment. He was quite resolved. There was no other escape. And\nyet--yet--yet, who would say what might not happen? Till the deed\nshould have been done, there would yet be a path open to the sweet\neasiness of innocence. When it should have been done, there would be\na final adieu to innocence. There would be no return to the white\nway, no possibility of repentance! How could a man repent while he\nwas still holding the guilty prize which he had won? Or how could he\ngive up the prize without delivering himself as a criminal to the\nlaw? But, nevertheless, he was resolved, and he determined that the\ndeed should be done on the Tuesday night.\n\nDuring the whole Tuesday he was thinking of it. Could he bring\nhimself to believe that all that story of a soul tormented for its\nwickedness in everlasting fire was but an old woman's tale? If he\ncould but bring himself to believe that! If he could do that, then\ncould he master his qualms. And why not? Religious thoughts had\nhitherto but little troubled his life. The Church and her services\nhad been nothing to him. He had lived neither with the fear nor\nwith the love of God at his heart. He knew that, and was but little\ndisposed to think that a line of conduct which had never been\nhitherto adopted by him would be embraced in his later life. He could\nnot think of himself as being even desirous to be religious. Why,\nthen, should qualms afflict him?\n\nThat prayer which he was accustomed to repeat to himself as he\nwent to rest was but a trick of his youth. It had come down to him\nfrom old, innocent days; and though it was seldom omitted, without\na shiver, nevertheless it was repeated with contempt. In broad\ndaylight, or when boon companions had been with him round the\ncandles, blasphemy had never frightened him. But now,--now in his\ntroubles, he remembered that there was a hell. He could not shake\nfrom himself the idea. For unrepented sin there was an eternity\nof torment which would last for ever! Such sin as this which he\npremeditated must remain unrepented, and there would be torment for\nhim for ever. Nevertheless, he must do it. And, after all, did not\nmany of the wise ones of the earth justify him in thinking that that\nthreat was but an old woman's tale?\n\nTuesday night came,--the late hours of Tuesday night,--the midnight\nhour at which he was sure that the women were in bed, and the will\nwas taken out from its hiding-place. He had already trimmed the wick\nand placed the candle on an outspread newspaper, so that no fragment\nof the ash should fall where it might not be collected. He had walked\nround the room to make himself sure that no aperture might possibly\nbe open. He put out the candle so as to see that no gleam of light\nfrom any source was making its way into the room, and then relighted\nit. The moment had come for the destruction of the document.\n\nHe read it all through yet again;--why he knew not, but in truth\ncraving some excuse for further delay. With what care the dying old\nman had written every word and completed every letter! He sat there\ncontemplating the old man's work, telling himself that it was for him\nto destroy it utterly by just a motion of his wrist. He turned round\nand trimmed the candle again, and still sat there with the paper in\nhis hand. Could it be that so great a result could come from so short\nan act? The damning of his own soul! Would it in truth be the giving\nup of his own soul to eternal punishment? God would know that he had\nnot meant to steal the property! God would know that he did not wish\nto steal it now! God would know that he was doing this as the only\nmeans of escape from misery which others were plotting for him! God\nwould know how cruelly he had been used! God would know the injustice\nwith which the old man had treated him! Then came moments in which he\nalmost taught himself to believe that in destroying the will he would\nbe doing no more than an act of rough justice, and that God would\ncertainly condemn no one to eternal punishment for a just act. But\nstill, whenever he would turn round to the candle, his hand would\nrefuse to raise the paper to the flame. When done, it could not be\nundone! And whether those eternal flames should or should not get\npossession of him, there would be before him a life agonised by the\ndread of them. What could Mr Cheekey do worse for him than that?\n\nThe Wednesday would at any rate do as well. Why rob himself of the\ncomfort of one day during which his soul would not be irretrievably\ncondemned? Now he might sleep. For this night, at any rate, he might\nsleep. He doubted whether he would ever sleep again after the doing\nof the deed. To be commonly wicked was nothing to him,--nothing to\nbreak through all those ordinary rules of life which parents teach\ntheir children and pastors their flocks, but as to which the world\nis so careless. To covet other men's goods, to speak evil of his\nneighbours, to run after his neighbour's wife if she came in his\npath, to steal a little in the ordinary way,--such as selling a lame\nhorse or looking over an adversary's hand at whist, to swear to a\nlie, or to ridicule the memory of his parents,--these peccadillos\nhad never oppressed his soul. That not telling of the will had been\nburdensome to him only because of the danger of discovery. But to\nburn a will, and thereby clearly to steal \u00c2\u00a31500 a year from his\ncousin! To commit felony! To do that for which he might be confined\nat Dartmoor all his life, with his hair cut, and dirty prison\nclothes, and hard food, and work to do! He thought it would be well\nto have another day of life in which he had not done the deed. He\ntherefore put the will back into the book and went to his bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nMr Apjohn's Success\n\n\nEarly on the Wednesday morning Mr Apjohn and Mr Brodrick were on\nfoot, and preparing for the performance of their very disagreeable\nday's work. Mr Brodrick did not believe at all in the day's work, and\nin discussing the matter with Mr Apjohn, after they had determined\nupon their line of action, made his mind known very clearly. To him\nit was simply apparent that if the will had fallen into the power\nof a dishonest person, and if the dishonest man could achieve his\npurpose by destroying it, the will would be destroyed. Of Cousin\nHenry he knew nothing. Cousin Henry might or might not be ordinarily\nhonest, as are other ordinary people. There might be no such will as\nthat spoken of, or there might be a will accidentally hidden,--or the\nwill might have been found and destroyed. But that they should be\nable to find a will, the hiding-place of which should be known to\nCousin Henry, was to his thinking out of the question. The subtler\nintellect of the other lawyer appreciating the intricacies of a\nweak man's mind saw more than his companion. When he found that\nMr Brodrick did not agree with him, and perceived that the other\nattorney's mind was not speculative in such a matter as this, he\nceased to try to persuade, and simply said that it was the duty of\nboth of them to leave no stone unturned. And so they started.\n\n\"I'll take you about half a mile out of our way to show you Mr\nEvans's gate,\" Mr Apjohn said, after they had started. \"His house is\nnot above twenty minutes from Llanfeare, and should it be necessary\nto ask his assistance, he will know all about it. You will find a\npoliceman there ready to come back with you. But my impression is\nthat Cousin Henry will not attempt to prevent any search which we may\nendeavour to make.\"\n\nIt was about ten when they reached the house, and, on being shown\ninto the book-room, they found Cousin Henry at his breakfast. The\nfront door was opened for them by Mrs Griffith, the housekeeper; and\nwhen Mr Apjohn expressed his desire to see Mr Jones, she made no\ndifficulty in admitting him at once. It was a part of the misery of\nCousin Henry's position that everybody around him and near to him\nwas against him. Mrs Griffith was aware that it was the purpose of\nMr Apjohn to turn her present master out of Llanfeare if possible,\nand she was quite willing to aid him by any means in her power.\nTherefore, she gave her master no notice of the arrival of the two\nstrangers, but ushered them into the room at once.\n\nCousin Henry's breakfast was frugal. All his meals had been frugal\nsince he had become owner of Llanfeare. It was not that he did not\nlike nice eating as well as another, but that he was too much afraid\nof his own servants to make known his own tastes. And then the\ngeneral discomforts of his position had been too great to admit of\nrelief from delicate dishes. There was the tea-pot on the table, and\nthe solitary cup, and the bread and butter, and the nearly naked bone\nof a cold joint of mutton. And the things were not set after the\nfashion of a well-to-do gentleman's table, but were put on as they\nmight be in a third-rate London lodging, with a tumbled tablecloth,\nand dishes, plates, and cups all unlike each other.\n\n\"Mr Jones,\" said the attorney from Carmarthen, \"this is your uncle,\nMr Brodrick, from Hereford.\" Then the two men who were so nearly\nconnected, but had never known each other, shook hands. \"Of course,\nthis matter,\" continued Mr Apjohn, \"is of great moment, and Mr\nBrodrick has come over to look after his daughter's interests.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to see my uncle,\" said Cousin Henry, turning his\neye involuntarily towards the shelf on which the volume of sermons\nwas resting. \"I am afraid I can't offer you much in the way of\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"We breakfasted before we left Carmarthen,\" said Mr Apjohn. \"If you\ndo not mind going on, we will talk to you whilst you are eating.\"\nCousin Henry said that he did not mind going on, but found it\nimpossible to eat a morsel. That which he did, and that which he\nendured during that interview, he had to do and had to endure\nfasting. \"I had better tell you at once,\" continued Mr Apjohn, \"what\nwe want to do now.\"\n\n\"What is it you want to do now? I suppose I have got to go into the\nassizes all the same on Friday?\"\n\n\"That depends. It is just possible that it should turn out to be\nunnecessary.\"\n\nAs he said this, he looked into Cousin Henry's face, and thought that\nhe discerned something of satisfaction. When he made the suggestion,\nhe understood well how great was the temptation offered in the\nprospect of not having to encounter Mr Cheekey.\n\n\"Both Mr Brodrick and I think it probable that your uncle's last will\nmay yet be concealed somewhere in the house.\" Cousin Henry's eye, as\nthis was said, again glanced up at the fatal shelf.\n\n\"When Mr Apjohn says that in my name,\" said Mr Brodrick, opening his\nmouth for the first time, \"you must understand that I personally know\nnothing of the circumstances. I am guided in my opinion only by what\nhe tells me.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Mr Apjohn. \"As the father of the young lady who would\nbe the heiress of Llanfeare if you were not the heir, I have of\ncourse told him everything,--even down to the most secret surmises of\nmy mind.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Cousin Henry.\n\n\"My position,\" continued Mr Apjohn, \"is painful and very peculiar;\nbut I find myself specially bound to act as the lawyer of the\ndeceased, and to carry out whatever was in truth his last will and\ntestament.\"\n\n\"I thought that was proved at Carmarthen,\" said Cousin Henry.\n\n\"No doubt. A will was proved,--a will that was very genuine if no\nsubsequent will be found. But, as you have been told repeatedly,\nthe proving of that will amounts to nothing if a subsequent one be\nforthcoming. The great question is this; Does a subsequent will\nexist?\"\n\n\"How am I to know anything about it?\"\n\n\"Nobody says you do.\"\n\n\"I suppose you wouldn't come here and bring my uncle Brodrick down on\nme,--giving me no notice, but coming into my house just when I am at\nbreakfast, without saying a word to any one,--unless you thought so.\nI don't see what right you have to be here at all!\"\n\nHe was trying to pluck up his spirit in order that he might get rid\nof them. Why, oh! why had he not destroyed that document when, on\nthe previous night, it had been brought out from its hiding-place,\npurposely in order that it might be burned?\n\n\"It is common, Mr Jones, for one gentleman to call upon another when\nthere is business to be done,\" said Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"But not common to come to a gentleman's house and accuse him of\nmaking away with a will.\"\n\n\"Nobody has done that,\" said Mr Brodrick.\n\n\"It is very like it.\"\n\n\"Will you allow us to search again? Two of my clerks will be here\njust now, and will go through the house with us, if you will permit\nit.\"\n\nCousin Henry sat staring at them. Not long ago he had himself asked\none of Mr Apjohn's clerks why they did not search again. But then the\nframing of his thoughts had been different. At that moment he had\nbeen desirous of surrendering Llanfeare altogether, so that he might\nalso get rid of Mr Cheekey. Now he had reached a bolder purpose. Now\nhe was resolved to destroy the will, enjoy the property, and face the\nbarrister. An idea came across his mind that they would hardly insist\nupon searching instantly if he refused. A petition to that effect had\nalready been made, and a petition implies the power of refusal on the\npart of him petitioned.\n\n\"Where do you want to look?\" he asked.\n\nUpon this Mr Brodrick allowed his eyes to wander round the room. And\nCousin Henry's eyes followed those of his uncle, which seemed to him\nto settle themselves exactly upon the one shelf.\n\n\"To search the house generally; your uncle's bed-room, for instance,\"\nsaid Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"Oh, yes; you can go there.\" This he said with an ill-formed, crude\nidea which sprang to his mind at the moment. If they would ascend\nto  the bed-room, then he could seize the will when left alone and\ndestroy it instantly,--eat it bit by bit if it were necessary,--go\nwith it out of the house and reduce it utterly to nothing before he\nreturned. He was still a free agent, and could go and come as he\npleased. \"Oh, yes; you can go there.\"\n\nBut this was not at all the scheme which had really formed itself in\nMr Apjohn's brain. \"Or perhaps we might begin here,\" he said. \"There\nare my two clerks just arrived in the fly.\"\n\nCousin Henry became first red and then pale, and he endeavoured\nto see in what direction Mr Brodrick had fixed his eye. Mr Apjohn\nhimself had not as yet looked anywhere round the books. He had sat\nclose at the table, with his gaze fixed on Cousin Henry's face, as\nCousin Henry had been well aware. If they began to search in the\nroom, they would certainly find the document. Of that he was quite\nsure. Not a book would be left without having been made to disclose\nall that it might contain between its leaves. If there was any\nchance left to him, it must be seized now,--now at this very moment.\nSuddenly the possession of Llanfeare was endeared to him by a\nthousand charms. Suddenly all fear of eternal punishment passed\naway from his thoughts. Suddenly he was permeated by a feeling of\ncontrition for his own weakness in having left the document unharmed.\nSuddenly he was brave against Mr Cheekey, as would be a tiger against\na lion. Suddenly there arose in his breast a great desire to save the\nwill even yet from the hands of these Philistines.\n\n\"This is my private room,\" he said. \"When I am eating my breakfast I\ncannot let you disturb me like that.\"\n\n\"In a matter such as this you wouldn't think of your own comfort!\"\nsaid Mr Apjohn severely. \"Comfort, indeed! What comfort can you have\nwhile the idea is present to you that this house in which you live\nmay possibly be the property of your cousin?\"\n\n\"It's very little comfort you've left me among you.\"\n\n\"Face it out, then, like a man; and when you have allowed us to do\nall that we can on her behalf, then enjoy your own, and talk of\ncomfort. Shall I have the men in and go on with the search as I\npropose?\"\n\nIf they were to find it,--as certainly they would,--then surely they\nwould not accuse him of having hidden it! He would be enabled to act\nsome show of surprise, and they would not dare to contradict him,\neven should they feel sure in their hearts that he had been aware of\nthe concealment! There would be great relief! There would be an end\nof so many troubles! But then how weak he would have been,--to have\nhad the prize altogether within his grasp and to have lost it! A\nburst of foul courage swelled in his heart, changing the very colour\nof his character for a time as he resolved that it should not be so.\nThe men could not search there,--so he told himself,--without further\nauthority than that which Mr Apjohn could give them. \"I won't be\ntreated in this way!\" he said.\n\n\"In what way do you mean, Mr Jones?\"\n\n\"I won't have my house searched as though I were a swindler and a\nthief. Can you go into any man's house and search it just as you\nplease, merely because you are an attorney?\"\n\n\"You told my man the other day,\" said Mr Apjohn, \"that we might renew\nthe search if we pleased.\"\n\n\"So you may; but you must get an order first from somebody. You are\nnobody.\"\n\n\"You are quite right,\" said Mr Apjohn, who was not at all disposed to\nbe angry in regard to any observation offered personally to himself.\n\"But surely it would be better for you that this should be done\nprivately. Of course we can have a search-warrant if it be necessary;\nbut then there must be a policeman to carry it out.\"\n\n\"What do I care for policemen?\" said Cousin Henry. \"It is you who\nhave treated me badly from first to last. I will do nothing further\nat your bidding.\"\n\nMr Apjohn looked at Mr Brodrick, and Mr Brodrick looked at Mr Apjohn.\nThe strange attorney would do nothing without directions from the\nother, and the attorney who was more at home was for a few moments a\nlittle in doubt. He got up from his chair, and walked about the room,\nwhile Cousin Henry, standing also, watched every movement which he\nmade. Cousin Henry took his place at the further end of the table\nfrom the fire, about six feet from the spot on which all his thoughts\nwere intent. There he stood, ready for action while the attorney\nwalked up and down the room meditating what it would be best that he\nshould do next. As he walked he seemed to carry his nose in the air,\nwith a gait different from what was usual to him. Cousin Henry had\nalready learned something of the man's ways, and was aware that his\nmanner was at present strange. Mr Apjohn was in truth looking along\nthe rows of the books. In old days he had often been in that room,\nand had read many of the titles as given on the backs. He knew the\nnature of many of the books collected there, and was aware that but\nvery few of them had ever been moved from their places in the old\nSquire's time for any purpose of use. He did not wish to stand and\ninspect them,--not as yet. He walked on as though collecting his\nthoughts, and as he walked he endeavoured to fix on some long set of\nsermons. He had in his mind some glimmering of remembrance that there\nwas such a set of books in the room. \"You might as well let us do as\nwe propose,\" he said.\n\n\"Certainly not. To tell you the truth, I wish you would go away, and\nleave me.\"\n\n\"Mr Cheekey will hear all about it, and how will you be able to\nanswer Mr Cheekey?\"\n\n\"I don't care about Mr Cheekey. Who is to tell Mr Cheekey? Will you\ntell him?\"\n\n\"I cannot take your part, you know, if you behave like this.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Mr Apjohn had stopped his walk, and was standing with\nhis back close to the book-shelves, with the back of his head almost\ntouching the set of Jeremy Taylor's works. There were ten volumes\nof them, and he was standing exactly in front of them. Cousin Henry\nwas just in front of him, doubting whether his enemy's position had\nnot been chosen altogether by accident, but still trembling at the\nnear approach. He was prepared for a spring if it was necessary.\nAnything should be hazarded now, so that discovery might be avoided.\nMr Brodrick was still seated in the chair which he had at first\noccupied, waiting till that order should be given to him to go for\nthe magistrate's warrant.\n\nMr Apjohn's eye had caught the author's name on the back of the book,\nand he remembered at once that he had seen the volume,--a volume\nwith Jeremy Taylor's name on the back of it,--lying on the old man's\ntable. \"Jeremy Taylor's Works. Sermons.\" He remembered the volume.\nThat had been a long time ago,--six months ago; but the old man might\nprobably take a long time over so heavy a book. \"You will let me look\nat some of these,\" he said, pointing with his thumb over his back.\n\n\"You shall not touch a book without a regular order,\" said Cousin\nHenry.\n\nMr Apjohn fixed the man's eye for a moment. He was the smaller man of\nthe two, and much the elder; but he was wiry, well set, and strong.\nThe other was soft, and unused to much bodily exercise. There could\nbe no doubt as to which would have the best of it in a personal\nstruggle. Very quickly he turned round and got his hand on one of\nthe set, but not on the right one. Cousin Henry dashed at him, and in\nthe struggle the book fell to the ground. Then the attorney seized\nhim by the throat, and dragged him forcibly back to the table. \"Take\nthem all out one by one, and shake them,\" he said to the other\nattorney,--\"that set like the one on the floor. I'll hold him while\nyou do it.\"\n\nMr Brodrick did as he was told, and, one by one, beginning from the\nlast volume, he shook them all till he came to volume 4. Out of that\nfell the document.\n\n\"Is it the will?\" shouted Mr Apjohn, with hardly breath enough to\nutter the words.\n\nMr Brodrick, with a lawyer's cautious hands, undid the folds, and\nexamined the document. \"It certainly is a will,\" he said,--\"and is\nsigned by my brother-in-law.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nHow Cousin Henry Was Let Off Easily\n\n\nIt was a moment of great triumph and of utter dismay,--of triumph\nto Mr Apjohn, and of dismay to Cousin Henry. The two men at this\nmoment,--as Mr Brodrick was looking at the papers,--were struggling\ntogether upon the ground. Cousin Henry, in his last frantic efforts,\nhad striven to escape from the grasp of his enemy so as to seize\nthe will, not remembering that by seizing it now he could retrieve\nnothing. Mr Apjohn had been equally determined that ample time should\nbe allowed to Mr Brodrick to secure any document that might be found,\nand, with the pugnacity which the state of fighting always produces,\nhad held on to his prey with a firm grip. Now for the one man there\nremained nothing but dismay; for the other was the full enjoyment of\nthe triumph produced by his own sagacity. \"Here is the date,\" said\nMr Brodrick, who had retreated with the paper to the furthest corner\nof the room. \"It is undoubtedly my brother-in-law's last will and\ntestament, and, as far as I can see at a glance, it is altogether\nregular.\"\n\n\"You dog!\" exclaimed Mr Apjohn, spurning Cousin Henry away from him.\n\"You wretched, thieving miscreant!\" Then he got up on to his legs\nand began to adjust himself, setting his cravat right, and smoothing\nhis hair with his hands. \"The brute has knocked the breath out of\nme,\" he said. \"But only to think that we should catch him after such\na fashion as this!\" There was a note of triumph in his voice which\nhe found it impossible to repress. He was thoroughly proud of his\nachievement. It was a grand thing to him that Isabel Brodrick should\nat last get the property which he had so long been anxious to secure\nfor her; but at the present moment it was a grander thing to have hit\nthe exact spot in which the document had been hidden by sheer force\nof intelligence.\n\nWhat little power of fighting there had ever been in Cousin Henry\nhad now been altogether knocked out of him. He attempted no further\nstruggle, uttered no denial, nor did he make any answer to the words\nof abuse which Mr Apjohn had heaped on his head. He too raised\nhimself from the floor, slowly collecting his limbs together, and\nseated himself in the chair nearest at hand, hiding his face with his\nhand.\n\n\"That is the most wonderful thing that ever came within my\nexperience,\" said Mr Brodrick.\n\n\"That the man should have hidden the will?\" asked Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"Why do you say I hid it?\" moaned Cousin Henry.\n\n\"You reptile!\" exclaimed Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"Not that he should have hidden it,\" said the Hereford attorney, \"but\nthat you should have found it, and found it without any search;--that\nyou should have traced it down to the very book in which the old man\nmust have left it!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Cousin Henry. \"He left it there. I did not hide it.\"\n\n\"Do you mean,\" said Mr Apjohn, turning upon him with all the severity\nof which he was capable, \"do you mean to say that during all this\ntime you have not known that the will was there?\" The wretched man\nopened his mouth and essayed to speak, but not a word came. \"Do you\nmean to tell us that when you refused us just now permission to\nsearch this room, though you were willing enough that we should\nsearch elsewhere, you were not acquainted with the hiding-place? When\nI asked you in my office the other day whether you knew where the\nwill was hidden, and you wouldn't answer me for very fear, though\nyou were glib enough in swearing that you had not hidden it yourself,\nthen you knew nothing about the book and its enclosure? When you told\nMr Griffith down at Coed that you had something to divulge, were you\nnot then almost driven to tell the truth by your dastardly cowardice\nas to this threatened trial? And did you not fail again because you\nwere afraid? You mean poltroon! Will you dare to say before us, now,\nthat when we entered the room this morning you did not know what the\nbook contained?\" Cousin Henry once more opened his mouth, but no\nword came. \"Answer me, sir, if you wish to escape any part of the\npunishment which you have deserved.\"\n\n\"You should not ask him to criminate himself,\" said Mr Brodrick.\n\n\"No!\" shrieked Cousin Henry; \"no! he shouldn't ask a fellow to tell\nagainst himself. It isn't fair; is it, Uncle Brodrick?\"\n\n\"If I hadn't made you tell against yourself one way or another,\" said\nMr Apjohn, \"the will would have been there still, and we should all\nhave been in the dark. There are occasions in which the truth must be\nscrewed out of a man. We have screwed it out of you, you miserable\ncreature! Brodrick, let us look at the paper. I suppose it is all\nright.\" He was so elated by the ecstasy of his success that he hardly\nknew how to contain himself. There was no prospect to him of any\nprofit in all this. It might, indeed, well be that all the expenses\nincurred, including the handsome honorarium which would still have\nto be paid to Mr Cheekey, must come out of his own pocket. But the\nglory of the thing was too great to admit of any considerations such\nas those. For the last month his mind had been exercised with the\nquestion of this will, whether there was such a will or not, and,\nif so, where was its hiding-place? Now he had brought his month's\nlabour, his month's speculation, and his month's anxiety to a supreme\nsuccess. In his present frame of mind it was nothing to him who\nmight pay the bill. \"As far as I can see,\" said Mr Brodrick, \"it is\naltogether in order.\"\n\n\"Let us look at it.\" Then Mr Apjohn, stretching out his hand, took\nthe document, and, seating himself in Cousin Henry's own chair at the\nbreakfast-table, read it through carefully from beginning to end. It\nwas wonderful,--the exactness with which the old Squire had copied,\nnot only every word, but every stop and every want of a stop in the\npreceding will. \"It is my own work, every morsel of it,\" said Mr\nApjohn, with thorough satisfaction. \"Why on earth did he not burn\nthe intermediate one which he made in this rascal's favour,\"--then\nhe indicated the rascal by a motion of his head--\"and make it all\nstraight in that way?\"\n\n\"There are men who think that a will once made should never be\ndestroyed,\" suggested Mr Brodrick.\n\n\"I suppose it was something of that kind. He was a fine old fellow,\nbut as obstinate as a mule. Well, what are we to do now?\"\n\n\"My nephew will have to consult his lawyer whether he will wish to\ndispute this document or not.\"\n\n\"I do not want to dispute anything,\" said Cousin Henry, whining.\n\n\"Of course he will be allowed time to think of it,\" said Mr Apjohn.\n\"He is in possession now, and will have plenty of time. He will have\nto answer some rather difficult questions from Mr Cheekey on Friday.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" shouted the victim.\n\n\"I am afraid it must be 'oh, yes,' Mr Jones! How are you to get out\nof it; eh? You are bound over to prosecute Mr Evans, of the _Herald_,\nfor defamation of character. Of course it will come out at the trial\nthat we have found this document. Indeed, I shall be at no trouble to\nconceal that fact,--nor, I suppose, will be Mr Brodrick. Why should\nwe?\"\n\n\"I thought you were acting as my lawyer.\"\n\n\"So I was,--and so I am,--and so I will. While you were supposed to\nbe an honest man,--or, rather, while it was possible that it might be\nso supposed,--I told you what, as an honest man, you were bound to\ndo. The _Carmarthen Herald_ knew that you were not honest,--and said\nso. If you are prepared to go into the court and swear that you knew\nnothing of the existence of this document, that you were not aware\nthat it was concealed in that book, that you did nothing to prevent\nus from looking for it this morning, I will carry on the case for\nyou. If I am called into the witness-box against you, of course I\nmust give my evidence for what it is worth;--and Mr Brodrick must do\nthe same.\"\n\n\"But it won't go on?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not if you are prepared to admit that there was no libel in all\nthat the newspaper said. If you agree that it was all true, then you\nwill have to pay the costs on both sides, and the indictment can be\nquashed. It will be a serious admission to make, but perhaps that\nwon't signify, seeing what your position as to character will be.\"\n\n\"I think you are almost too hard upon him,\" said Mr Brodrick.\n\n\"Am I? Can one be too hard on a man who has acted as he has done?\"\n\n\"He is hard,--isn't he, Mr Brodrick?\"\n\n\"Hard! Why, yes;--I should think I am. I mean to be hard. I mean to\ngo on trampling you to pieces till I see your cousin, Miss Brodrick,\nput into full possession of this estate. I don't mean to leave you a\nloop-hole of escape by any mercy. At the present moment you are Henry\nJones, Esq., of Llanfeare, and will be so till you are put out by the\nhard hand of the law. You may turn round for anything I know, and say\nthat this document is a forgery.\"\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\n\"That Mr Brodrick and I brought it here with us and put it in the\nbook.\"\n\n\"I sha'n't say anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Who did put it there?\" Cousin Henry sobbed and groaned, but said\nnothing. \"Who did put it there? If you want to soften our hearts to\nyou in any degree, if you wish us to contrive some mode of escape for\nyou, tell the truth. Who put the will into that book?\"\n\n\"How am I to know?\"\n\n\"You do know! Who put it there?\"\n\n\"I suppose it was Uncle Indefer.\"\n\n\"And you had seen it there?\" Again Cousin Henry sobbed and groaned.\n\n\"You should hardly ask him that,\" said Mr Brodrick.\n\n\"Yes! If any good can be done for him, it must be by making him feel\nthat he must help us by making our case easy for us. You had seen\nit there? Speak the word, and we will do all we can to let you off\neasily.\"\n\n\"Just by an accident,\" said he.\n\n\"You did see it, then?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I chanced to see it.\"\n\n\"Yes; of course you did. And then the Devil went to work with you and\nprompted you to destroy it?\" He paused as though asking a question,\nbut to this question Cousin Henry found it impossible to make any\nanswer. \"But the Devil had not quite hold enough over you to make you\ndo that? It was so;--was it not? There was a conscience with you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"But the conscience was not strong enough to force you to give it up\nwhen you found it?\" Cousin Henry now burst out into open tears. \"That\nwas about it, I suppose? If you can bring yourself to make a clean\nbreast of it, it will be easier for you.\"\n\n\"May I go back to London at once?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well; as to that, I think we had better take some little time for\nconsideration. But I think I may say that, if you will make our\nway easy for us, we will endeavour to make yours easy for you. You\nacknowledge this to be your uncle's will as far as you know?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"You acknowledge that Mr Brodrick found it in this book which I now\nhold in my hand?\"\n\n\"I acknowledge that.\"\n\n\"This is all that I ask you to sign your name to. As for the rest,\nit is sufficient that you have confessed the truth to your uncle and\nto me. I will just write a few lines that you shall sign, and then\nwe will go back to Carmarthen and do the best we can to prevent\nthe trial for next Friday.\" Thereupon Mr Apjohn rang the bell, and\nasked Mrs Griffith to bring him paper and ink. With these he wrote a\nletter addressed to himself, which he invited Cousin Henry to sign as\nsoon as he had read it aloud to him and to Mr Brodrick. The letter\ncontained simply the two admissions above stated, and then went\non to authorise Mr Apjohn, as the writer's attorney, to withdraw\nthe indictment against the proprietor of the _Carmarthen Herald_,\n\"in consequence,\" as the letter said, \"of the question as to the\npossession of Llanfeare having been settled now in an unexpected\nmanner.\"\n\nWhen the letter was completed, the two lawyers went away, and Cousin\nHenry was left to his own meditation. He sat there for a while,\nso astounded by the transaction of the morning as to be unable to\ncollect his thoughts. All this that had agitated him so profoundly\nfor the last month had been set at rest by the finding of the will.\nThere was no longer any question as to what must be done. Everything\nhad been done. He was again a London clerk, with a small sum of money\nbesides his clerkship, and the security of lowliness into which to\nfall back! If only they would be silent;--if only it might be thought\nby his fellow-clerks in London that the will had been found by them\nwithout any knowledge on his part,--then he would be satisfied. A\nterrible catastrophe had fallen upon him, but one which would not\nbe without consolation if with the estate might be made to pass\naway from him all responsibilities and all accusations as to the\nestate. That terrible man had almost promised him that a way of\nretreat should be made easy to him. At any rate, he would not be\ncross-examined by Mr Cheekey. At any rate, he would not be brought\nto trial. There was almost a promise, too, that as little should be\nsaid as possible. There must, he supposed, be some legal form of\nabdication on his part, but he was willing to execute that as quickly\nas possible on the simple condition that he should be allowed to\ndepart without being forced to speak further on the matter to any\none in Wales. Not to have to see the tenants, not to have to say\neven a word of farewell to the servants, not to be carried into\nCarmarthen,--above all, not to face Mr Cheekey and the Court,--this\nwas all he asked now from a kind Fate.\n\nAt about two Mrs Griffith came into the room, ostensibly to take away\nthe breakfast things. She had seen the triumphant face of Mr Apjohn,\nand knew that some victory had been gained. But when she saw that the\nbreakfast had not been touched, her heart became soft. The way to\nmelt the heart of a Mrs Griffith is to eat nothing. \"Laws, Mr Jones,\nyou have not had a mouthful. Shall I do you a broil?\" He assented to\nthe broil, and ate it, when it was cooked, with a better appetite\nthan he had enjoyed since his uncle's death. Gradually he came to\nfeel that a great load had been taken from off his shoulders. The\nwill was no longer hidden in the book. Nothing had been done of which\nhe could not repent. There was no prospect of a life before him made\nhorrid by one great sin. He could not be Squire of Llanfeare; nor\nwould he be a felon,--a felon always in his own esteem. Upon the\nwhole, though he hardly admitted as much to himself, the man's\ncondition had been improved by the transactions of the morning.\n\n\"You don't quite agree with all that I have done this morning,\" said\nMr Apjohn, as soon as the two lawyers were in the fly together.\n\n\"I am lost in admiration at the clearness of your insight.\"\n\n\"Ah! that comes of giving one's undivided thoughts to a matter. I\nhave been turning it over in my mind till I have been able to see it\nall. It was odd, wasn't it, that I should have foretold to you all\nthat happened, almost to the volume?\"\n\n\"Quite to the volume!\"\n\n\"Well, yes; to the volume of sermons. Your brother-in-law read\nnothing but sermons. But you thought I shouldn't have asked those\nquestions.\"\n\n\"I don't like making a man criminate himself,\" said Mr Brodrick.\n\n\"Nor do I,--if I mean to criminate him too. My object is to let him\noff. But to enable us to do that we must know exactly what he knew\nand what he had done. Shall I tell you what occurred to me when you\nshook the will out of the book? How would it be if he declared that\nwe had brought it with us? If he had been sharp enough for that, the\nvery fact of our having gone to the book at once would have been\nevidence against us.\"\n\n\"He was not up to it.\"\n\n\"No, poor devil! I am inclined to think that he has got as bad as he\ndeserves. He might have been so much worse. We owe him ever so much\nfor not destroying the will. His cousin will have to give him the\n\u00c2\u00a34000 which he was to have given her.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly.\"\n\n\"He has been hardly used, you know, by his uncle; and, upon my word,\nhe has had a bad time of it for the last month. I wouldn't have been\nhated and insulted as he has been by those people up there,--not for\nall Llanfeare twice over. I think we've quenched him now, so that\nhe'll run smooth. If so, we'll let him off easily. If I had treated\nhim less hardly just now, he might have gathered courage and turned\nupon us. Then it would have been necessary to crush him altogether. I\nwas thinking all through how we might let him off easiest.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nIsabel's Petition\n\n\nThe news was soon all about Carmarthen. A new will had been found, in\naccordance with which Miss Brodrick was to become owner of Llanfeare,\nand,--which was of more importance to Carmarthen at the present\nmoment,--there was to be no trial! The story, as told publicly, was\nas follows;--Mr Apjohn, by his sagacity, had found the will. It had\nbeen concealed in a volume of sermons, and Mr Apjohn, remembering\nsuddenly that the old man had been reading these sermons shortly\nbefore his death, had gone at once to the book. There the will\nhad been discovered, which had at once been admitted to be a true\nand formal document by the unhappy pseudo-proprietor. Henry Jones\nhad acknowledged his cousin to be the heiress, and under these\ncircumstances had conceived it to be useless to go on with the trial.\nSuch was the story told, and Mr Apjohn, fully aware that the story\nwent very lame on one leg, did his best to remedy the default by\nexplaining that it would be unreasonable to expect that a man should\ncome into court and undergo an examination by Mr Cheekey just when he\nhad lost a fine property.\n\n\"Of course I know all that,\" said Mr Apjohn when the editor of the\npaper remarked to him that the libel, if a libel, would be just\nas much a libel whether Mr Henry Jones were or were not the owner\nof Llanfeare. \"Of course I know all that; but you are hardly to\nexpect that a man is to come and assert himself amidst a cloud of\ndifficulties when he has just undergone such a misfortune as that!\nYou have had your fling, and are not to be punished for it. That\nought to satisfy you.\"\n\n\"And who'll pay all the expenses?\" asked Mr Evans.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr Apjohn, scratching his head; \"you, of course, will\nhave to pay nothing. Geary will settle all that with me. That poor\ndevil at Llanfeare ought to pay.\"\n\n\"He won't have the money.\"\n\n\"I, at any rate, will make it all right with Geary; so that needn't\ntrouble you.\"\n\nThis question as to the expense was much discussed by others in\nCarmarthen. Who in truth would pay the complicated lawyers' bill\nwhich must have been occasioned, including all these flys out to\nLlanfeare? In spite of Mr Apjohn's good-natured explanations, the\npublic of Carmarthen was quite convinced that Henry Jones had in\ntruth hidden the will. If so, he ought not only to be made to pay\nfor everything, but be sent to prison also and tried for felony. The\nopinion concerning Cousin Henry in Carmarthen on the Thursday and\nFriday was very severe indeed. Had he shown himself in the town, he\nwould almost have been pulled in pieces. To kill him and to sell his\ncarcase for what it might fetch towards lessening the expenses which\nhe had incurred would not be too bad for him. Mr Apjohn was, of\ncourse, the hero of the hour, and, as far as Carmarthen could see, Mr\nApjohn would have to pay the bill. All this, spoken as it was by many\nmouths, reached Mr Brodrick's ears, and induced him to say a word or\ntwo to Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"This affair,\" said he, \"will of course become a charge upon the\nproperty?\"\n\n\"What affair?\"\n\n\"This trial which is not to take place, and the rest of it.\"\n\n\"The trial will have nothing to do with the estate,\" said Mr Apjohn.\n\n\"It has everything to do with it. I only mention it now to let you\nknow that, as Isabel's father, I shall make it my business to look\nafter that.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Brodrick,\" said the Carmarthen attorney, with that\ngleam of triumph in his eye which had been so often seen there since\nthe will had tumbled out of the volume of sermons in the book-room,\n\"the whole of this matter has been such a pleasure to me that I don't\ncare a straw about the costs. If I paid for it all from beginning to\nend out of my own pocket, I should have had my whack for my money.\nPerhaps Miss Isabel will recompense me by letting me make her will\nsome day.\"\n\nSuch were the feelings and such were the words spoken at Carmarthen;\nand it need only be said further, in regard to Carmarthen, that the\noperations necessary for proving the later will and annulling the\nformer one, for dispossessing Cousin Henry and for putting Isabel\ninto the full fruition of all her honours, went on as quickly as it\ncould be effected by the concentrated energy of Mr Apjohn and all his\nclerks.\n\nCousin Henry, to whom we may be now allowed to bid farewell, was\npermitted to remain within the seclusion of the house at Llanfeare\ntill his signature had been obtained to the last necessary document.\nNo one spoke a word to him; no one came to see him. If there\nwere intruders about the place anxious to catch a glimpse of the\npseudo-Squire, they were disappointed.\n\nMrs Griffith, under the attorney's instructions, was more courteous\nto him than she had been when he was her master. She endeavoured to\nget him things nice to eat, trying to console him by titbits. None of\nthe tenants appeared before him, nor was there a rough word spoken to\nhim, even by young Cantor.\n\nIn all this Cousin Henry did feel some consolation, and was greatly\ncomforted when he heard from the office in London that his stool at\nthe desk was still kept open for him.\n\nThe _Carmarthen Herald_, in its final allusion to the state of things\nat Llanfeare, simply declared that the proper will had been found at\nlast, and that Miss Isabel Brodrick was to be restored to her rights.\nGuided by this statement, the directors in London were contented to\nregard their clerk as having been unfortunate rather than guilty.\n\nFor the man himself, the reader, it is hoped, will feel some\ncompassion. He had been dragged away from London by false hopes.\nAfter so great an injury as that inflicted on him by the last change\nin the Squire's purpose it was hardly unnatural that the idea of\nretaliation should present itself to him when the opportunity came in\nhis way. Not to do that which justice demands is so much easier to\nthe conscience than to commit a deed which is palpably fraudulent!\nAt the last his conscience saved him, and Mr Apjohn will perhaps be\nthought to have been right in declaring that much was due to him in\nthat he had not destroyed the will. His forbearance was recompensed\nfully.\n\nAs soon as the money could be raised on the property, the full sum\nof \u00c2\u00a34000 was paid to him, that having been the amount with which the\nSquire had intended to burden the property on behalf of his niece\nwhen he was minded to put her out of the inheritance.\n\nIt may be added that, notorious as the whole affair was at\nCarmarthen, but little of Cousin Henry's wicked doings were known up\nin London.\n\nWe must now go back to Hereford. By agreement between the two\nlawyers, no tidings of her good fortune were at once sent to Isabel.\n\"There is so many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip,\" said Mr Apjohn\nto her father. But early in the following week Mr Brodrick himself\ntook the news home with him.\n\n\"My dear,\" he said to her as soon as he found himself alone with\nher,--having given her intimation that an announcement of great\nimportance was to be made to her,--\"it turns out that after all your\nUncle Indefer did make another will.\"\n\n\"I was always quite sure of that, papa.\"\n\n\"How were you sure?\"\n\n\"He told me so, papa.\"\n\n\"He told you so! I never heard that before.\"\n\n\"He did,--when he was dying. What was the use of talking of it? But\nhas it been found?\"\n\n\"It was concealed within a book in the library. As soon as the\nnecessary deeds can be executed Llanfeare will be your own. It is\nprecisely word for word the same as that which he had made before he\nsent for your cousin Henry.\"\n\n\"Then Henry has not destroyed it?\"\n\n\"No, he did not destroy it.\"\n\n\"Nor hid it where we could not find it?\"\n\n\"Nor did he hide it.\"\n\n\"Oh, how I have wronged him;--how I have injured him!\"\n\n\"About that we need say nothing, Isabel. You have not injured him.\nBut we may let all that pass away. The fact remains that you are the\nheiress of Llanfeare.\"\n\nOf course he did by degrees explain to her all the\ncircumstances,--how the will had been found and not revealed, and how\nfar Cousin Henry had sinned in the matter; but it was agreed between\nthem that no further evil should be said in the family as to their\nunfortunate relative. The great injury which he might have done to\nthem he had abstained from doing.\n\n\"Papa,\" she said to her father when they were again together alone\nthat same evening, \"you must tell all this to Mr Owen. You must tell\nhim everything, just as you have told me.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear, if you wish it.\"\n\n\"I do wish it.\"\n\n\"Why should you not have the pleasure of telling him yourself?\"\n\n\"It would not be a pleasure, and therefore I will get you to do it.\nMy pleasure, if there be any pleasure in it, must come afterwards. I\nwant him to know it before I see him myself.\"\n\n\"He will be sure to have some stupid notion,\" said her father,\nsmiling.\n\n\"I want him to have his notion, whether it be stupid or otherwise,\nbefore I see him. If you do not mind, papa, going to him as soon as\npossible, I shall be obliged to you.\"\n\nIsabel, when she found herself alone, had her triumph also. She was\nfar from being dead to the delights of her inheritance. There had\nbeen a period in her life in which she had regarded it as her certain\ndestiny to be the possessor of Llanfeare, and she had been proud of\nthe promised position. The tenants had known her as the future owner\nof the acres which they cultivated, and had entertained for her and\nshown to her much genuine love. She had made herself acquainted with\nevery homestead, landmark, and field about the place. She had learnt\nthe wants of the poor, and the requirements of the little school.\nEverything at Llanfeare had had an interest for her. Then had come\nthat sudden change in her uncle's feelings,--that new idea of\nduty,--and she had borne it like a heroine. Not only had she never\nsaid a word of reproach to him, but she had sworn to herself that\neven in her own heart she would throw no blame upon him. A great blow\nhad come upon her, but she had taken it as though it had come from\nthe hand of the Almighty,--as it might have been had she lost her\neyesight, or been struck with palsy. She promised herself that it\nshould be so, and she had had strength to be as good as her word. She\nhad roused herself instantly from the effect of the blow, and, after\na day of consideration, had been as capable as ever to do the work\nof her life. Then had come her uncle's last sickness, those spoken\nbut doubtful words, her uncle's death, and that conviction that\nher cousin was a felon. Then she had been unhappy, and had found\nit difficult to stand up bravely against misfortune. Added to this\nhad been her stepmother's taunts and her father's distress at the\nresolution she had taken. The home to which she had returned had been\nthoroughly unhappy to her. And there had been her stern purpose not\nto give her hand to the man who loved her and whom she so dearly\nloved! She was sure of her purpose, and yet she was altogether\ndiscontented with herself. She was sure that she would hold by her\npurpose, and yet she feared that her purpose was wrong. She had\nrefused the man when she was rich, and her pride would not let her go\nto him now that she was poor. She was sure of her purpose,--but yet\nshe almost knew that her pride was wrong.\n\nBut now there would be a triumph. Her eyes gleamed brightly as she\nthought of the way in which she would achieve her triumph. Her eyes\ngleamed very brightly as she felt sure within her own bosom that she\nwould succeed. Yes: he would, no doubt, have some stupid notion, as\nher father said. But she would overcome his stupidity. She, as a\nwoman, could be stronger than he as a man. He had almost ridiculed\nher obstinacy, swearing that he would certainly overcome it. There\nshould be no ridicule on her part, but she would certainly overcome\nhis obstinacy.\n\nFor a day or two Mr Owen was not seen. She heard from her father\nthat the tidings had been told to her lover, but she heard no more.\nMr Owen did not show himself at the house; and she, indeed, hardly\nexpected that he should do so. Her stepmother suddenly became\ngracious,--having no difficulty in explaining that she did so because\nof the altered position of things.\n\n\"My dearest Isabel, it does make such a difference!\" she said; \"you\nwill be a rich lady, and will never have to think about the price\nof shoes.\" The sisters were equally plain-spoken, and were almost\nawe-struck in their admiration.\n\nThree or four days after the return of Mr Brodrick, Isabel took her\nbonnet and shawl, and walked away all alone to Mr Owen's lodgings.\nShe knew his habits, and was aware that he was generally to be found\nat home for an hour before his dinner. It was no time, she said to\nherself, to stand upon little punctilios. There had been too much\nbetween them to let there be any question of a girl going after her\nlover. She was going after her lover, and she didn't care who knew\nit. Nevertheless, there was a blush beneath her veil as she asked at\nthe door whether Mr Owen was at home. Mr Owen was at home, and she\nwas shown at once into his parlour.\n\n\"William,\" she said;--throughout their intimacy she had never called\nhim William before;--\"you have heard my news?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I have heard it;\"--very seriously, with none of\nthat provoking smile with which he had hitherto responded to all her\nassertions.\n\n\"And you have not come to congratulate me?\"\n\n\"I should have done so. I do own that I have been wrong.\"\n\n\"Wrong;--very wrong! How was I to have any of the enjoyment of my\nrestored rights unless you came to enjoy them with me?\"\n\n\"They can be nothing to me, Isabel.\"\n\n\"They shall be everything to you, sir.\"\n\n\"No, my dear.\"\n\n\"They are to be everything to me, and they can be nothing to me\nwithout you. You know that, I suppose?\" Then she waited for his\nreply. \"You know that, do you not? You know what I feel about that, I\nsay. Why do you not tell me? Have you any doubt?\"\n\n\"Things have been unkind to us, Isabel, and have separated us.\"\n\n\"Nothing shall separate us.\" Then she paused for a moment. She had\nthought of it all, and now had to pause before she could execute her\npurpose. She had got her plan ready, but it required some courage,\nsome steadying of herself to the work before she could do it. Then\nshe came close to him,--close up to him, looking into his face as he\nstood over her, not moving his feet, but almost retreating with his\nbody from her close presence. \"William,\" she said, \"take me in your\narms and kiss me. How often have you asked me during the last month!\nNow I have come for it.\"\n\nHe paused a moment as though it were possible to refuse, as though\nhis collected thoughts and settled courage might enable him so to\noutrage her in her petition. Then he broke down, and took her in\nhis arms, and pressed her to his bosom, and kissed her lips, and\nher forehead, and her cheeks,--while she, having once achieved her\npurpose, attempted in vain to escape from his long embrace.\n\n\"Now I shall be your wife,\" she said at last, when her breath had\nreturned to her.\n\n\"It should not be so.\"\n\n\"Not after that? Will you dare to say so to me,--after that? You\ncould never hold up your head again. Say that you are happy? Tell me\nthat you are happy. Do you think that I can be happy unless you are\nhappy with me?\" Of course he gave her all the assurances that were\nneeded, and made it quite unnecessary that she should renew her\nprayer.\n\n\"And I beg, Mr Owen, that for the future you will come to me, and not\nmake me come to you.\" This she said as she was taking her leave. \"It\nwas very disagreeable, and very wrong, and will be talked about ever\nso much. Nothing but my determination to have my own way could have\nmade me do it.\" Of course he promised her that there should be no\noccasion for her again to put herself to the same inconvenience.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nConclusion\n\n\nIsabel spent one pleasant week with her lover at Hereford, and\nthen was summoned into Carmarthenshire. Mr Apjohn came over at her\nfather's invitation, and insisted on taking her back to Llanfeare.\n\n\"There are a thousand things to be done,\" he said, \"and the sooner\nyou begin to do them the better. Of course you must live at the old\nhouse, and you had better take up your habitation there for a while\nbefore this other change is made.\" The other change was of course the\ncoming marriage, with the circumstances of which the lawyer had been\nmade acquainted.\n\nThen there arose other questions. Should her father go with her or\nshould her lover? It was, however, at last decided that she should go\nalone as regarded her family, but under the care of Mr Apjohn. It was\nshe who had been known in the house, and she who had better now be\nseen there as her uncle's representative.\n\n\"You will have to be called Miss Jones,\" said the lawyer, \"Miss\nIndefer Jones. There will be a form, for which we shall have to pay,\nI am afraid; but we had better take the name at once. You will have\nto undergo a variety of changes in signing your name. You will become\nfirst Miss Isabel Brodrick Indefer Jones, then Mrs William Owen,\nthen, when he shall have gone through the proper changes, Mrs William\nOwen Indefer Jones. As such I hope you may remain till you shall be\nknown as the oldest inhabitant of Carmarthenshire.\"\n\nMr Apjohn took her to Carmarthen, and hence on to Llanfeare. At the\nstation there were many to meet her, so that her triumph, as she got\ninto the carriage, was almost painful to her. When she heard the\nbells ring from the towers of the parish churches, she could hardly\nbelieve that the peals were intended to welcome her back to her old\nhome. She was taken somewhat out of her way round by the creek and\nCoed, so that the little tinkling of her own parish church might\nnot be lost upon her. If this return of hers to the estate was so\nimportant to others as to justify these signs, what must it be to her\nand how deep must be the convictions as to her own duties?\n\nAt the gate of Coed farmyard the carriage stopped, and the old farmer\ncame out to say a few words to her.\n\n\"God bless you, Miss Isabel; this is a happy sight to see.\"\n\n\"This is so kind of you, Mr Griffith.\"\n\n\"We've had a bad time of it, Miss Isabel;--not that we wished to\nquarrel with your dear uncle's judgment, or that we had a right to\nsay much against the poor gentleman who has gone;--but we expected\nyou, and it went against the grain with us to have our expectations\ndisappointed. We shall always look up to you, miss; but, at the same\ntime, I wish you joy with all my heart of the new landlord you're\ngoing to set over us. Of course that was to be expected, but you'll\nbe here with us all the time.\" Isabel, while the tears ran down her\ncheeks, could only press the old man's hand at parting.\n\n\"Now, my dear,\" said Mr Apjohn, as they went on to the house, \"he has\nonly said just what we've all been feeling. Of course it has been\nstronger with the tenants and servants than with others. But all\nround the country it has been the same. A man, if an estate belong\nto himself personally, can do what he likes with it, as he can with\nthe half-crowns in his pocket; but where land is concerned, feelings\ngrow up which should not be treated rudely. In one sense Llanfeare\nbelonged to your uncle to do what he liked with it, but in another\nsense he shared it only with those around him; and when he was\ninduced by a theory which he did not himself quite understand to\nbring your cousin Henry down among these people, he outraged their\nbest convictions.\"\n\n\"He meant to do his duty, Mr Apjohn.\"\n\n\"Certainly; but he mistook it. He did not understand the root of that\nidea of a male heir. The object has been to keep the old family, and\nthe old adherences, and the old acres together. England owes much\nto the manner in which this has been done, and the custom as to a\nmale heir has availed much in the doing of it. But in this case, in\nsticking to the custom, he would have lost the spirit, and, as far\nas he was concerned, would have gone against the practice which he\nwished to perpetuate. There, my dear, is a sermon for you, of which,\nI dare say, you do not understand a word.\"\n\n\"I understand every syllable of it, Mr Apjohn,\" she answered.\n\nThey soon arrived at the house, and there they found not only Mrs\nGriffith and the old cook, who had never left the premises, but the\nold butler also, who had taken himself off in disgust at Cousin\nHenry's character, but had now returned as though there had been no\nbreak in his continuous service. They received her with triumphant\nclamours of welcome. To them the coming of Cousin Henry, and the\ndeath of the old Squire, and then the departure of their young\nmistress, had been as though the whole world had come to an end for\nthem. To serve was their only ambition,--to serve and to be made\ncomfortable while they were serving; but to serve Cousin Henry was\nto them altogether ignominious. The old Squire had done something\nwhich, though they acknowledged it to be no worse on his part than\na mistake, had to them been cruelly severe. Suddenly to be told\nthat they were servants to such a one as Cousin Henry,--servants to\nsuch a man without any contract or agreement on their part;--to be\nhanded over like the chairs and tables to a disreputable clerk from\nLondon, whom in their hearts they regarded as very much inferior to\nthemselves! And they, too, like Mr Griffith and the tenants, had\nbeen taught to look for the future reign of Queen Isabel as a thing\nof course. In that there would have been an implied contract,--an\nunderstanding on their part that they had been consulted and had\nagreed to this destination of themselves. But Cousin Henry! Now this\ngross evil to themselves and to all around them had been remedied,\nand justice was done. They had all been strongly convinced that the\nSquire had made and had left behind him another will. The butler had\nbeen quite certain that this had been destroyed by Cousin Henry, and\nhad sworn that he would not stand behind the chair of a felon. The\ngardener had been equally violent, and had declined even to cut a\ncabbage for Cousin Henry's use. The women in the house had only\nsuspected. They had felt sure that something was wrong, but had\ndoubted between various theories. But now everything was right;\nnow the proper owner had come; now the great troubles had been\nvanquished, and Llanfeare would once again be a fitting home for\nthem.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Isabel! oh, Miss Isabel!\" said Mrs Griffith, absolutely\nsobbing at her young mistress's feet up in her bed-room; \"I did say\nthat it could never go on like that. I did use to think that the Lord\nAlmighty would never let it go on like that! It couldn't be that Mr\nHenry Jones was to remain always landlord of Llanfeare.\"\n\nWhen she came downstairs and took her seat, as she did by chance,\nin the old arm-chair which her uncle had been used to occupy, Mr\nApjohn preached to her another sermon, or rather sang a loud p\u00c3\u00a6an of\nirrepressible delight.\n\n\"Now, my dear, I must go and leave you,--happily in your own house.\nYou can hardly realise how great a joy this has been to me,--how\ngreat a joy it is.\"\n\n\"I know well how much we owe you.\"\n\n\"From the first moment in which he intimated to me his wish to make\na  change in his will, I became so unhappy about it as almost to lose\nmy rest. I knew that I went beyond what I ought to have done in the\nthings that I said to him, and he bore it kindly.\"\n\n\"He was always kind.\"\n\n\"But I couldn't turn him. I told him what I told you to-day on the\nroad, but it had no effect on him. Well, I had nothing to do but to\nobey his orders. This I did most grudgingly. It was a heartbreak\nto me, not only because of you, my dear, but for the sake of the\nproperty, and because I had heard something of your cousin. Then came\nthe rumour of this last will. He must have set about it as soon as\nyou had left the house.\"\n\n\"He never told me that he was going to do it.\"\n\n\"He never told any one; that is quite certain. But it shows how his\nmind must have been at work. Perhaps what I said may have had some\neffect at last. Then I heard from the Cantors what they had been\nasked to do. I need not tell you all that I felt then. It would have\nbeen better for him to send for me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"So much better for that poor young man's sake.\" The poor young man\nwas of course Cousin Henry. \"But I could not interfere. I could only\nhear what I did hear,--and wait. Then the dear old man died!\"\n\n\"I knew then that he had made it.\"\n\n\"You knew that he had thought that he had done it; but how is one to\nbe sure of the vacillating mind of an old dying man? When we searched\nfor the one will and read the other, I was very sure that the Cantors\nhad been called upon to witness his signature. Who could doubt as\nto that? But he who had so privately drawn out the deed might as\nprivately destroy it. By degrees there grew upon me the conviction\nthat he had not destroyed it; that it still existed,--or that your\ncousin had destroyed it. The latter I never quite believed. He was\nnot the man to do it,--neither brave enough nor bad enough.\"\n\n\"I think not bad enough.\"\n\n\"Too small in his way altogether. And yet it was clear as the sun at\nnoonday that he was troubled in his conscience. He shut himself up in\nhis misery, not knowing how strong a tale his own unhappiness told\nagainst him. Why did he not rejoice in the glory of his position?\nThen I said to myself that he was conscious of insecurity.\"\n\n\"His condition must have been pitiable.\"\n\n\"Indeed, yes. I pitied him from the bottom of my heart. The contumely\nwith which he was treated by all went to my heart even after I knew\nthat he was misbehaving. I knew that he was misbehaving;--but how? It\ncould only be by hiding the will, or by being conscious that it was\nhidden. Though he was a knave, he was not cunning. He failed utterly\nbefore the slightest cunning on the part of others. When I asked him\nwhether he knew where it was hidden, he told a weak lie, but told\nthe truth openly by the look of his eyes. He was like a little girl\nwho pauses and blushes and confesses all the truth before she half\nmurmurs her naughty fib. Who can be really angry with the child who\nlies after that unwilling fashion? I had to be severe upon him till\nall was made clear; but I pitied him from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\n\"You have been good to all of us.\"\n\n\"At last it became clear to me that your uncle had put it somewhere\nhimself. Then came a chance remembrance of the sermons he used to\nread, and by degrees the hiding-place was suggested to me. When at\nlast he welcomed us to go and search in his uncle's bed-room, but\nforbade us to touch anything in the book-room,--then I was convinced.\nI had but to look along the shelves till I found the set, and I\nalmost knew that we had got the prize. Your father has told you how\nhe flew at me when I attempted to lift my hand to the books. The\nagony of the last chance gave him a moment of courage. Then your\nfather shook the document out from among the leaves.\"\n\n\"That must have been a moment of triumph to you.\"\n\n\"Yes;--it was. I did feel a little proud of my success. And I am\nproud as I see you sitting there, and feel that justice has been\ndone.\"\n\n\"By your means!\"\n\n\"That justice has been done, and that every one has his own again.\nI own to all the litigious pugnacity of a lawyer. I live by such\nfighting, and I like it. But a case in which I do not believe crushes\nme. To have an injustice to get the better of, and then to trample\nit well under foot,--that is the triumph that I desire. It does not\noften happen to a lawyer to have had such a chance as this, and I\nfancy that it could not have come in the way of a man who would have\nenjoyed it more than I do.\" Then at last, after lingering about the\nhouse, he bade her farewell. \"God bless you, and make you happy\nhere,--you and your husband. If you will take my advice you will\nentail the property. You, no doubt, will have children, and will take\ncare that in due course it shall go to the eldest boy. There can be\nno doubt as to the wisdom of that. But you see what terrible misery\nmay be occasioned by not allowing those who are to come after you to\nknow what it is they are to expect.\"\n\nFor a few weeks Isabel remained alone at Llanfeare, during which all\nthe tenants came to call upon her, as did many of the neighbouring\ngentry.\n\n\"I know'd it,\" said young Cantor, clenching his fist almost in her\nface. \"I was that sure of it I couldn't hardly hold myself. To think\nof his leaving it in a book of sermons!\"\n\nThen, after the days were past during which it was thought well that\nshe should remain at Llanfeare to give orders, and sign papers, and\nmake herself by very contact with her own property its mistress and\nowner, her father came for her and took her back to Hereford. Then\nshe had incumbent upon her the other duty of surrendering herself\nand all that she possessed to another. As any little interest which\nthis tale may possess has come rather from the heroine's material\ninterests than from her love,--as it has not been, so to say, a love\nstory,--the reader need not follow the happy pair absolutely to the\naltar. But it may be said, in anticipation of the future, that in due\ntime an eldest son was born, that Llanfeare was entailed upon him\nand his son, and that he was so christened as to have his somewhat\ngrandiloquent name inscribed as William Apjohn Owen Indefer Jones.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK COUSIN HENRY***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 24103-8.txt or 24103-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/4\/1\/0\/24103\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1217,"split":"test"}
