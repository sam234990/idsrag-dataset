They meet the trapper (Natty Bumppo), who has left his home in New York state to find a place where he cannot hear the sound of people cutting down the forests. In the years between his other adventures and this novel, he tells us only that he has walked all the way to the Pacific Ocean and seen all the land between the coasts (a heroic feat, considering Lewis and Clark hadn\u2019t yet completed the same trek). That night, a band of Teton warriors steal all of Ishmael\u2019s animals, stranding the immigrants. The doctor returns the next morning along with his donkey. The trapper helps the family relocate their wagons, including one with mysterious contents, to a nearby butte where they will be safer when the Tetons return. Middleton joins the group when he stumbles upon the trapper and Paul. Before they return to the butte, Ishmael and his family go looking for his eldest son, Asa, whom they find murdered. The trapper, Paul, and Middleton return to camp, find Inez whom Abiram and Ishmael had been keeping captive, and flee with her and Ellen. Ishmael chases them until the Tetons capture the Trapper and his crew. They escape the Tetons, and then Ishmael forms an alliance with the Indians. The Indians attempt to recapture the trapper by surrounding them with a prairie fire, but the trapper lights a backfire and saves everyone. They meet up with Hard-heart, a Pawnee Indian who survived the fire wrapped in a buffalo skin, and attempt to escape to his village. The Tetons capture them. Ishmael demands the trapper, Inez, and Ellen for helping the Tetons but is denied and turned away. Mahtoree intends to take Inez and Ellen for his new wives. Le Balafre attempts to spare Hard-heart\u2019s life by making Hard-heart his son. Hard-heart refuses, kills Weucha, and flees the village. When Hard-heart\u2019s Pawnee warriors attack the Teton village, the trapper and his friends escape, only to be captured by Ishmael. The trapper is accused of Asa\u2019s death until Abiram\u2019s guilt is discovered. Abiram is executed, and Ishmael\u2019s family returns east without Inez, Ellen, or the doctor. Middleton, Inez, Paul and Ellen travel back to Louisiana and Kentucky, respectively, while the trapper joins a Pawnee village located on a tributary of the Missouri River. Middleton and Paul return just in time to witness the trapper's noble death and bury him.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prairie, by J.

Fenimore Cooper\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\"The Prairie\" was the third in order of Fenimore Cooper's\nLeatherstocking Tales. Its first appearance was in the year 1827. The\nidea of the story had suggested itself to him, we are told, before he\nhad finished its immediate forerunner, \"The Last of the Mohicans.\" He\nchose entirely new scenes for it, \"resolved to cross the Mississippi and\nwander over the desolate wastes of the remote Western prairies.\" He had\nbeen taking every chance that came of making a personal acquaintance\nwith the Indian chiefs of the western tribes who were to be encountered\nabout this period on their way in the frequent Indian embassies to\nWashington. \"He saw much to command his admiration,\" says Mrs. Cooper,\n\"in these wild braves... It was a matter of course that in drawing\nIndian character he should dwell on the better traits of the picture,\nrather than on the coarser and more revolting though more common points.\nLike West, he could see the Apollo in the young Mohawk.\"\n\nWhen in July, 1826, Cooper landed in England with his wife and family,\nhe carried his Indian memories and associations with him. They crossed\nto France, and ascended the Seine by steamboat, and then settled for\na time in Paris. Of their quarters there in the Rue St. Maur, Sarah\nFenimore Cooper writes:\n\n\"It was thoroughly French in character. There was a short, narrow,\ngloomy lane or street, shut in between lofty dwelling houses, the lane\noften dark, always filthy, without sidewalks, a gutter running through\nthe centre, over which, suspended from a rope, hung a dim oil lamp or\ntwo--such was the Rue St. Maur, in the Faubourg St. Germain. It was a\ngloomy approach certainly. But a tall porte cochere opened, and suddenly\nthe whole scene changed. Within those high walls, so forbidding in\naspect, there lay charming gardens, gay with parterres of flowers, and\nshaded by noble trees, not only those belonging to the house itself,\nbut those of other adjoining dwellings of the same character--one looked\nover park-like grounds covering some acres. The hotel itself, standing\non the street, was old, and built on a grand scale; it had been the home\nof a French ducal family in the time of Louis XIV. The rooms on the two\nlower floors were imposing and spacious; with ceilings of great height,\ngilded wainscoting and various quaint little medallion pictures of\nshepherds and shepherdesses, and other fancies of the time of Madame de\nSevigne. Those little shepherds were supposed to have looked down upon\n_la mere beaute_, and upon _la plus jolie fille de France_ as she danced\nher incomparable minuets. Those grand saloons were now devoted to the\nhumble service of a school for young ladies. But on the third floor,\nto which one ascended by a fine stone stairway, broad and easy,\nwith elaborate iron railings, there was a more simple set of rooms,\ncomfortably furnished, where the American family were pleasantly\nprovided for, in a home of their own. Unwilling to separate from his\nchildren, who were placed at the school, the traveller adopted this plan\nthat he might be near them. One of the rooms, overlooking the garden,\nand opening on a small terrace, became his study. He was soon at work.\nIn his writing-desk lay some chapters of a new novel. The MS. had\ncrossed the ocean with him, though but little had been added to its\npages during the wanderings of the English and French journeys.\"\n\nWhen, some months later, the story appeared, its effect was immediate on\nboth sides the Atlantic. It is worth note that during his French visit\nCooper met Sir Walter Scott. Cooper was born at Burlington, New Jersey,\n15th Sept., 1789, and died at Cooperstown, New York (which took its name\nfrom his father), 14th Sept., 1851.\n\n\nThe following is his literary record:\n\nPrecaution, 1820; The Spy, 1821; The Pioneers, 1823; The Pilot,\n1823; Lionel Lincoln, or the Leaguer of Boston, 1825; The Last of the\nMohicans, 1826; The Prairie, 1827; The Red Rover, 1828; Notions of the\nAmericans, 1828; The Wept of Wish-ton-Wish, 1829; The Water-witch,\n1830; The Bravo, 1831; The Heidenmauer, or the Benedictines, 1832; The\nHeadsman, 1833; A Letter to his Countrymen, 1834; The Monikins, 1835;\nSketches of Switzerland, 1836; Gleanings in Europe: 1837; (England)\n1837; (Italy) 1838; The American Democrat, 1838; Homeward Bound, 1838;\nThe Chronicles of Cooperstown, 1838; Home as Found (Eve Effingham),\n1839; History of the U.

Virtually, the whole of this immense region is\na plain. For a distance extending nearly 1500 miles east and west, and\n600 north and south, there is scarcely an elevation worthy to be called\na mountain. Even hills are not common; though a good deal of the face\nof the country has more or less of that \"rolling\" character, which is\ndescribed in the opening pages of this work.\n\nThere is much reason to believe, that the territory which now composes\nOhio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and a large portion of the country\nwest of the Mississippi, lay formerly under water. The soil of all the\nformer states has the appearance of an alluvial deposit; and isolated\nrocks have been found, of a nature and in situations which render it\ndifficult to refute the opinion that they have been transferred to their\npresent beds by floating ice. This theory assumes that the Great Lakes\nwere the deep pools of one immense body of fresh water, which lay too\nlow to be drained by the irruption that laid bare the land.\n\nIt will be remembered that the French, when masters of the Canadas and\nLouisiana, claimed the whole of the territory in question. Their hunters\nand advanced troops held the first communications with the savage\noccupants, and the earliest written accounts we possess of these vast\nregions, are from the pens of their missionaries. Many French words\nhave, consequently, become of local use in this quarter of America, and\nnot a few names given in that language have been perpetuated. When the\nadventurers, who first penetrated these wilds, met, in the centre of the\nforests, immense plains, covered with rich verdure or rank grasses, they\nnaturally gave them the appellation of meadows. As the English succeeded\nthe French, and found a peculiarity of nature, differing from all they\nhad yet seen on the continent, already distinguished by a word that did\nnot express any thing in their own language, they left these natural\nmeadows in possession of their title of convention. In this manner has\nthe word \"Prairie\" been adopted into the English tongue.\n\nThe American prairies are of two kinds. Those which lie east of the\nMississippi are comparatively small, are exceedingly fertile, and are\nalways surrounded by forests. They are susceptible of high cultivation,\nand are fast becoming settled. They abound in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois,\nand Indiana. They labour under the disadvantages of a scarcity of wood\nand water,--evils of a serious character, until art has had time to\nsupply the deficiencies of nature. As coal is said to abound in all\nthat region, and wells are generally successful, the enterprise of the\nemigrants is gradually prevailing against these difficulties.\n\nThe second description of these natural meadows lies west of the\nMississippi, at a distance of a few hundred miles from that river, and\nis called the Great Prairies. They resemble the steppes of Tartary more\nthan any other known portion of Christendom; being, in fact, a vast\ncountry, incapable of sustaining a dense population, in the absence of\nthe two great necessaries already named. Rivers abound, it is true; but\nthis region is nearly destitute of brooks and the smaller water courses,\nwhich tend so much to comfort and fertility.\n\nThe origin and date of the Great American Prairies form one of natures\nmost majestic mysteries. The general character of the United States, of\nthe Canadas, and of Mexico, is that of luxuriant fertility. It would\nbe difficult to find another portion of the world, of the same extent,\nwhich has so little useless land as the inhabited parts of the American\nUnion. Most of the mountains are arable, and even the prairies, in this\nsection of the republic, are of deep alluvion. The same is true between\nthe Rocky Mountains and the Pacific. Between the two lies the broad\nbelt, of comparative desert, which is the scene of this tale, appearing\nto interpose a barrier to the progress of the American people westward.\n\nThe Great Prairies appear to be the final gathering place of the red\nmen. The remnants of the Mohicans, and the Delawares, of the Creeks,\nChoctaws, and Cherokees, are destined to fulfil their time on these\nvast plains. The entire number of the Indians, within the Union, is\ndifferently computed, at between one and three hundred thousand souls.\nMost of them inhabit the country west of the Mississippi. At the period\nof the tale, they dwelt in open hostility; national feuds passing from\ngeneration to generation. The power of the republic has done much to\nrestore peace to these wild scenes, and it is now possible to travel\nin security, where civilised man did not dare to pass unprotected\nfive-and-twenty years ago.\n\nThe reader, who has perused the two former works, of which this is the\nnatural successor, will recognise an old acquaintance in the principal\ncharacter of the story. We have here brought him to his end, and we\ntrust he will be permitted to slumber in the peace of the just.\n\nJ. F. Cooper Paris June 1832\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PRAIRIE\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n            I pray thee, shepherd, if that love or gold,\n            Can in this desert place buy entertainment,\n            Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.\n                                               --As you like it.\n\nMuch was said and written, at the time, concerning the policy of\nadding the vast regions of Louisiana, to the already immense and\nbut half-tenanted territories of the United States. As the warmth of\ncontroversy however subsided, and party considerations gave place to\nmore liberal views, the wisdom of the measure began to be generally\nconceded. It soon became apparent to the meanest capacity, that, while\nnature had placed a barrier of desert to the extension of our population\nin the west, the measure had made us the masters of a belt of fertile\ncountry, which, in the revolutions of the day, might have become the\nproperty of a rival nation. It gave us the sole command of the great\nthoroughfare of the interior, and placed the countless tribes of\nsavages, who lay along our borders, entirely within our control; it\nreconciled conflicting rights, and quieted national distrusts; it\nopened a thousand avenues to the inland trade, and to the waters of\nthe Pacific; and, if ever time or necessity shall require a peaceful\ndivision of this vast empire, it assures us of a neighbour that will\npossess our language, our religion, our institutions, and it is also to\nbe hoped, our sense of political justice.\n\nAlthough the purchase was made in 1803, the spring of the succeeding\nyear was permitted to open, before the official prudence of the\nSpaniard, who held the province for his European master, admitted the\nauthority, or even of the entrance of its new proprietors. But the\nforms of the transfer were no sooner completed, and the new government\nacknowledged, than swarms of that restless people, which is ever found\nhovering on the skirts of American society, plunged into the thickets\nthat fringed the right bank of the Mississippi, with the same careless\nhardihood, as had already sustained so many of them in their toilsome\nprogress from the Atlantic states, to the eastern shores of the \"father\nof rivers.\"[*]\n\n   [*] The Mississippi is thus termed in several of the Indian languages.\n    The reader will gain a more just idea of the importance of this\n    stream, if he recalls to mind the fact, that the Missouri and the\n    Mississippi are properly the same river. Their united lengths\n    cannot be greatly short of four thousand miles.\n\nTime was necessary to blend the numerous and affluent colonists of the\nlower province with their new compatriots; but the thinner and more\nhumble population above, was almost immediately swallowed in the vortex\nwhich attended the tide of instant emigration. The inroad from the\neast was a new and sudden out-breaking of a people, who had endured a\nmomentary restraint, after having been rendered nearly resistless by\nsuccess. The toils and hazards of former undertakings were forgotten, as\nthese endless and unexplored regions, with all their fancied as well as\nreal advantages, were laid open to their enterprise. The consequences\nwere such as might easily have been anticipated, from so tempting an\noffering, placed, as it was, before the eyes of a race long trained in\nadventure and nurtured in difficulties.\n\nThousands of the elders, of what were then called the New States[*],\nbroke up from the enjoyment of their hard-earned indulgences, and were\nto be seen leading long files of descendants, born and reared in the\nforests of Ohio and Kentucky, deeper into the land, in quest of that\nwhich might be termed, without the aid of poetry, their natural and more\ncongenial atmosphere. The distinguished and resolute forester who\nfirst penetrated the wilds of the latter state, was of the number. This\nadventurous and venerable patriarch was now seen making his last remove;\nplacing the \"endless river\" between him and the multitude his own\nsuccess had drawn around him, and seeking for the renewal of enjoyments\nwhich were rendered worthless in his eyes, when trammelled by the forms\nof human institutions.[+]\n\n    [*] All the states admitted to the American Union, since the\n    revolution, are called New States, with the exception of Vermont:\n    that had claims before the war; which were not, however, admitted\n    until a later day.\n\n    [+] Colonel Boon, the patriarch of Kentucky. This venerable and hardy\n    pioneer of civilisation emigrated to an estate three hundred miles\n    west of the Mississippi, in his ninety-second year, because he\n    found a population of ten to the square mile, inconveniently\n    crowded!\n\nIn the pursuit of adventures such as these, men are ordinarily governed\nby their habits or deluded by their wishes. A few, led by the phantoms\nof hope, and ambitious of sudden affluence, sought the mines of the\nvirgin territory; but by far the greater portion of the emigrants\nwere satisfied to establish themselves along the margins of the\nlarger water-courses, content with the rich returns that the generous,\nalluvial, bottoms of the rivers never fail to bestow on the most\ndesultory industry. In this manner were communities formed with magical\nrapidity; and most of those who witnessed the purchase of the empty\nempire, have lived to see already a populous and sovereign state,\nparcelled from its inhabitants, and received into the bosom of the\nnational Union, on terms of political equality.\n\nThe incidents and scenes which are connected with this legend, occurred\nin the earliest periods of the enterprises which have led to so great\nand so speedy a result.\n\nThe harvest of the first year of our possession had long been passed,\nand the fading foliage of a few scattered trees was already beginning to\nexhibit the hues and tints of autumn, when a train of wagons issued from\nthe bed of a dry rivulet, to pursue its course across the undulating\nsurface, of what, in the language of the country of which we write, is\ncalled a \"rolling prairie.\" The vehicles, loaded with household goods\nand implements of husbandry, the few straggling sheep and cattle that\nwere herded in the rear, and the rugged appearance and careless mien of\nthe sturdy men who loitered at the sides of the lingering teams, united\nto announce a band of emigrants seeking for the Elderado of the West.\nContrary to the usual practice of the men of their caste, this party had\nleft the fertile bottoms of the low country, and had found its way, by\nmeans only known to such adventurers, across glen and torrent, over\ndeep morasses and arid wastes, to a point far beyond the usual limits of\ncivilised habitations. In their front were stretched those broad plains,\nwhich extend, with so little diversity of character, to the bases of the\nRocky Mountains; and many long and dreary miles in their rear, foamed\nthe swift and turbid waters of La Platte.\n\nThe appearance of such a train, in that bleak and solitary place, was\nrendered the more remarkable by the fact, that the surrounding country\noffered so little, that was tempting to the cupidity of speculation,\nand, if possible, still less that was flattering to the hopes of an\nordinary settler of new lands.\n\nThe meagre herbage of the prairie, promised nothing, in favour of a hard\nand unyielding soil, over which the wheels of the vehicles rattled as\nlightly as if they travelled on a beaten road; neither wagons nor beasts\nmaking any deeper impression, than to mark that bruised and withered\ngrass, which the cattle plucked, from time to time, and as often\nrejected, as food too sour, for even hunger to render palatable.\n\nWhatever might be the final destination of these adventurers, or the\nsecret causes of their apparent security in so remote and unprotected\na situation, there was no visible sign of uneasiness, uncertainty, or\nalarm, among them. Including both sexes, and every age, the number of\nthe party exceeded twenty.\n\nAt some little distance in front of the whole, marched the individual,\nwho, by his position and air, appeared to be the leader of the band. He\nwas a tall, sun-burnt, man, past the middle age, of a dull countenance\nand listless manner. His frame appeared loose and flexible; but it\nwas vast, and in reality of prodigious power. It was, only at moments,\nhowever, as some slight impediment opposed itself to his loitering\nprogress, that his person, which, in its ordinary gait seemed so\nlounging and nerveless, displayed any of those energies, which lay\nlatent in his system, like the slumbering and unwieldy, but terrible,\nstrength of the elephant. The inferior lineaments of his countenance\nwere coarse, extended and vacant; while the superior, or those nobler\nparts which are thought to affect the intellectual being, were low,\nreceding and mean.\n\nThe dress of this individual was a mixture of the coarsest vestments of\na husbandman with the leathern garments, that fashion as well as use,\nhad in some degree rendered necessary to one engaged in his present\npursuits. There was, however, a singular and wild display of prodigal\nand ill judged ornaments, blended with his motley attire. In place of\nthe usual deer-skin belt, he wore around his body a tarnished silken\nsash of the most gaudy colours; the buck-horn haft of his knife was\nprofusely decorated with plates of silver; the marten's fur of his cap\nwas of a fineness and shadowing that a queen might covet; the buttons\nof his rude and soiled blanket-coat were of the glittering coinage of\nMexico; the stock of his rifle was of beautiful mahogany, riveted and\nbanded with the same precious metal, and the trinkets of no less than\nthree worthless watches dangled from different parts of his person.\nIn addition to the pack and the rifle which were slung at his back,\ntogether with the well filled, and carefully guarded pouch and horn,\nhe had carelessly cast a keen and bright wood-axe across his shoulder,\nsustaining the weight of the whole with as much apparent ease, as if he\nmoved, unfettered in limb, and free from incumbrance.\n\nA short distance in the rear of this man, came a group of youths very\nsimilarly attired, and bearing sufficient resemblance to each other,\nand to their leader, to distinguish them as the children of one family.\nThough the youngest of their number could not much have passed the\nperiod, that, in the nicer judgment of the law, is called the age of\ndiscretion, he had proved himself so far worthy of his progenitors as\nto have reared already his aspiring person to the standard height of\nhis race. There were one or two others, of different mould, whose\ndescriptions must however be referred to the regular course of the\nnarrative.\n\nOf the females, there were but two who had arrived at womanhood; though\nseveral white-headed, olive-skinned faces were peering out of the\nforemost wagon of the train, with eyes of lively curiosity and\ncharacteristic animation. The elder of the two adults, was the sallow\nand wrinkled mother of most of the party, and the younger was a\nsprightly, active, girl, of eighteen, who in figure, dress, and mien,\nseemed to belong to a station in society several gradations above that\nof any one of her visible associates. The second vehicle was covered\nwith a top of cloth so tightly drawn, as to conceal its contents,\nwith the nicest care. The remaining wagons were loaded with such rude\nfurniture and other personal effects, as might be supposed to belong\nto one, ready at any moment to change his abode, without reference to\nseason or distance.\n\nPerhaps there was little in this train, or in the appearance of its\nproprietors, that is not daily to be encountered on the highways of this\nchangeable and moving country. But the solitary and peculiar scenery,\nin which it was so unexpectedly exhibited, gave to the party a marked\ncharacter of wildness and adventure.\n\nIn the little valleys, which, in the regular formation of the land,\noccurred at every mile of their progress, the view was bounded, on two\nof the sides, by the gradual and low elevations, which gave name to\nthe description of prairie we have mentioned; while on the others,\nthe meagre prospect ran off in long, narrow, barren perspectives, but\nslightly relieved by a pitiful show of coarse, though somewhat luxuriant\nvegetation. From the summits of the swells, the eye became fatigued with\nthe sameness and chilling dreariness of the landscape. The earth was not\nunlike the Ocean, when its restless waters are heaving heavily, after\nthe agitation and fury of the tempest have begun to lessen. There\nwas the same waving and regular surface, the same absence of foreign\nobjects, and the same boundless extent to the view. Indeed so very\nstriking was the resemblance between the water and the land, that,\nhowever much the geologist might sneer at so simple a theory, it would\nhave been difficult for a poet not to have felt, that the formation of\nthe one had been produced by the subsiding dominion of the other. Here\nand there a tall tree rose out of the bottoms, stretching its naked\nbranches abroad, like some solitary vessel; and, to strengthen the\ndelusion, far in the distance, appeared two or three rounded thickets,\nlooming in the misty horizon like islands resting on the waters. It\nis unnecessary to warn the practised reader, that the sameness of\nthe surface, and the low stands of the spectators, exaggerated the\ndistances; but, as swell appeared after swell, and island succeeded\nisland, there was a disheartening assurance that long, and seemingly\ninterminable, tracts of territory must be passed, before the wishes of\nthe humblest agriculturist could be realised.\n\nStill, the leader of the emigrants steadily pursued his way, with no\nother guide than the sun, turning his back resolutely on the abodes\nof civilisation, and plunging, at each step, more deeply if not\nirretrievably, into the haunts of the barbarous and savage occupants of\nthe country. As the day drew nigher to a close, however, his mind, which\nwas, perhaps, incapable of maturing any connected system of forethought,\nbeyond that which related to the interests of the present moment,\nbecame, in some slight degree, troubled with the care of providing for\nthe wants of the hours of darkness.\n\nOn reaching the crest of a swell that was a little higher than the usual\nelevations, he lingered a minute, and cast a half curious eye, on either\nhand, in quest of those well known signs, which might indicate a place,\nwhere the three grand requisites of water, fuel and fodder were to be\nobtained in conjunction.\n\nIt would seem that his search was fruitless; for after a few moments of\nindolent and listless examination, he suffered his huge frame to descend\nthe gentle declivity, in the same sluggish manner that an over fatted\nbeast would have yielded to the downward pressure.\n\nHis example was silently followed by those who succeeded him, though\nnot until the young men had manifested much more of interest, if not of\nconcern in the brief enquiry, which each, in his turn, made on gaining\nthe same look-out. It was now evident, by the tardy movements both of\nbeasts and men, that the time of necessary rest was not far distant. The\nmatted grass of the lower land, presented obstacles which fatigue began\nto render formidable, and the whip was becoming necessary to urge\nthe lingering teams to their labour. At this moment, when, with the\nexception of the principal individual, a general lassitude was getting\nthe mastery of the travellers, and every eye was cast, by a sort of\ncommon impulse, wistfully forward, the whole party was brought to a\nhalt, by a spectacle, as sudden as it was unexpected.\n\nThe sun had fallen below the crest of the nearest wave of the prairie,\nleaving the usual rich and glowing train on its track. In the centre\nof this flood of fiery light, a human form appeared, drawn against the\ngilded background, as distinctly, and seemingly as palpable, as though\nit would come within the grasp of any extended hand. The figure was\ncolossal; the attitude musing and melancholy, and the situation directly\nin the route of the travellers. But imbedded, as it was, in its setting\nof garish light, it was impossible to distinguish its just proportions\nor true character.\n\nThe effect of such a spectacle was instantaneous and powerful. The man\nin front of the emigrants came to a stand, and remained gazing at\nthe mysterious object, with a dull interest, that soon quickened into\nsuperstitious awe. His sons, so soon as the first emotions of surprise\nhad a little abated, drew slowly around him, and, as they who governed\nthe teams gradually followed their example, the whole party was soon\ncondensed in one, silent, and wondering group. Notwithstanding\nthe impression of a supernatural agency was very general among the\ntravellers, the ticking of gun-locks was heard, and one or two of the\nbolder youths cast their rifles forward, in readiness for service.\n\n\"Send the boys off to the right,\" exclaimed the resolute wife and\nmother, in a sharp, dissonant voice; \"I warrant me, Asa, or Abner will\ngive some account of the creature!\"\n\n\"It may be well enough, to try the rifle,\" muttered a dull looking\nman, whose features, both in outline and expression, bore no small\nresemblance to the first speaker, and who loosened the stock of his\npiece and brought it dexterously to the front, while delivering this\nopinion; \"the Pawnee Loups are said to be hunting by hundreds in the\nplains; if so, they'll never miss a single man from their tribe.\"\n\n\"Stay!\" exclaimed a soft toned, but alarmed female voice, which was\neasily to be traced to the trembling lips of the younger of the two\nwomen; \"we are not altogether; it may be a friend!\"\n\n\"Who is scouting, now?\" demanded the father, scanning, at the same time,\nthe cluster of his stout sons, with a displeased and sullen eye. \"Put by\nthe piece, put by the piece;\" he continued, diverting the other's\naim, with the finger of a giant, and with the air of one it might be\ndangerous to deny. \"My job is not yet ended; let us finish the little\nthat remains, in peace.\"\n\nThe man, who had manifested so hostile an intention, appeared to\nunderstand the other's allusion, and suffered himself to be diverted\nfrom his object. The sons turned their inquiring looks on the girl, who\nhad so eagerly spoken, to require an explanation; but, as if content\nwith the respite she had obtained for the stranger, she sunk back, in\nher seat, and chose to affect a maidenly silence.\n\nIn the mean time, the hues of the heavens had often changed. In place of\nthe brightness, which had dazzled the eye, a gray and more sober light\nhad succeeded, and as the setting lost its brilliancy, the proportions\nof the fanciful form became less exaggerated, and finally distinct.\nAshamed to hesitate, now that the truth was no longer doubtful, the\nleader of the party resumed his journey, using the precaution, as he\nascended the slight acclivity, to release his own rifle from the strap,\nand to cast it into a situation more convenient for sudden use.\n\nThere was little apparent necessity, however, for such watchfulness.\nFrom the moment when it had thus unaccountably appeared, as it were,\nbetween the heavens and the earth, the stranger's figure had neither\nmoved nor given the smallest evidence of hostility. Had he harboured\nany such evil intention, the individual who now came plainly into view,\nseemed but little qualified to execute them.\n\nA frame that had endured the hardships of more than eighty seasons, was\nnot qualified to awaken apprehension, in the breast of one as powerful\nas the emigrant. Notwithstanding his years, and his look of emaciation,\nif not of suffering, there was that about this solitary being, however,\nwhich said that time, and not disease, had laid his hand heavily on him.\nHis form had withered, but it was not wasted. The sinews and muscles,\nwhich had once denoted great strength, though shrunken, were still\nvisible; and his whole figure had attained an appearance of induration,\nwhich, if it were not for the well known frailty of humanity, would have\nseemed to bid defiance to the further approaches of decay. His dress was\nchiefly of skins, worn with the hair to the weather; a pouch and horn\nwere suspended from his shoulders; and he leaned on a rifle of uncommon\nlength, but which, like its owner, exhibited the wear of long and hard\nservice.\n\nAs the party drew nigher to this solitary being, and came within a\ndistance to be heard, a low growl issued from the grass at his feet, and\nthen, a tall, gaunt, toothless, hound, arose lazily from his lair, and\nshaking himself, made some show of resisting the nearer approach of the\ntravellers.\n\n\"Down, Hector, down,\" said his master, in a voice, that was a little\ntremulous and hollow with age. \"What have ye to do, pup, with men who\njourney on their lawful callings?\"\n\n\"Stranger, if you ar' much acquainted in this country,\" said the\nleader of the emigrants, \"can you tell a traveller where he may find\nnecessaries for the night?\"\n\n\"Is the land filled on the other side of the Big River?\" demanded the\nold man, solemnly, and without appearing to hearken to the other's\nquestion; \"or why do I see a sight, I had never thought to behold\nagain?\"\n\n\"Why, there is country left, it is true, for such as have money, and ar'\nnot particular in the choice,\" returned the emigrant; \"but to my taste,\nit is getting crowdy. What may a man call the distance, from this place\nto the nighest point on the main river?\"\n\n\"A hunted deer could not cool his sides, in the Mississippi, without\ntravelling a weary five hundred miles.\"\n\n\"And what may you name the district, hereaway?\"\n\n\"By what name,\" returned the old man, pointing significantly upward,\n\"would you call the spot, where you see yonder cloud?\"\n\nThe emigrant looked at the other, like one who did not comprehend his\nmeaning, and who half suspected he was trifled with, but he contented\nhimself by saying--\n\n\"You ar' but a new inhabitant, like myself, I reckon, stranger,\notherwise you would not be backward in helping a traveller to some\nadvice; words cost but little, and sometimes lead to friendships.\"\n\n\"Advice is not a gift, but a debt that the old owe to the young. What\nwould you wish to know?\"\n\n\"Where I may camp for the night. I'm no great difficulty maker, as to\nbed and board; but, all old journeyers, like myself, know the virtue of\nsweet water, and a good browse for the cattle.\"\n\n\"Come then with me, and you shall be master of both; and little more is\nit that I can offer on this hungry prairie.\"\n\nAs the old man was speaking, he raised his heavy rifle to his shoulder,\nwith a facility a little remarkable for his years and appearance, and\nwithout further words led the way over the acclivity to the adjacent\nbottom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n           Up with my tent: here will I lie to-night,\n           But where, to-morrow?--Well, all's one for that\n                                            --Richard the Third.\n\nThe travellers soon discovered the usual and unerring evidences that the\nseveral articles necessary to their situation were not far distant. A\nclear and gurgling spring burst out of the side of the declivity, and\njoining its waters to those of other similar little fountains in its\nvicinity, their united contributions formed a run, which was easily to\nbe traced, for miles along the prairie, by the scattering foliage and\nverdure which occasionally grew within the influence of its moisture.\nHither, then, the stranger held his way, eagerly followed by the willing\nteams, whose instinct gave them a prescience of refreshment and rest.\n\nOn reaching what he deemed a suitable spot, the old man halted, and\nwith an enquiring look, he seemed to demand if it possessed the\nneeded conveniences. The leader of the emigrants cast his eyes,\nunderstandingly, about him, and examined the place with the keenness of\none competent to judge of so nice a question, though in that dilatory\nand heavy manner, which rarely permitted him to betray precipitation.\n\n\"Ay, this may do,\" he said, satisfied with his scrutiny; \"boys, you have\nseen the last of the sun; be stirring.\"\n\nThe young men manifested a characteristic obedience. The order, for such\nin tone and manner it was, in truth, was received with respect; but the\nutmost movement was the falling of an axe or two from the shoulder\nto the ground, while their owners continued to regard the place with\nlistless and incurious eyes. In the mean time, the elder traveller, as\nif familiar with the nature of the impulses by which his children were\ngoverned, disencumbered himself of his pack and rifle, and, assisted\nby the man already mentioned as disposed to appeal so promptly to the\nrifle, he quietly proceeded to release the cattle from the gears.\n\nAt length the eldest of the sons stepped heavily forward, and, without\nany apparent effort, he buried his axe to the eye, in the soft body of a\ncotton-wood tree. He stood, a moment, regarding the effect of the blow,\nwith that sort of contempt with which a giant might be supposed to\ncontemplate the puny resistance of a dwarf, and then flourishing the\nimplement above his head, with the grace and dexterity with which a\nmaster of the art of offence would wield his nobler though less useful\nweapon, he quickly severed the trunk of the tree, bringing its tall\ntop crashing to the earth in submission to his prowess. His companions\nregarded the operation with indolent curiosity, until they saw the\nprostrate trunk stretched on the ground, when, as if a signal for a\ngeneral attack had been given, they advanced in a body to the work, and\nin a space of time, and with a neatness of execution that would have\nastonished an ignorant spectator, they stripped a small but suitable\nspot of its burden of forest, as effectually, and almost as promptly, as\nif a whirlwind had passed along the place.\n\nThe stranger had been a silent but attentive observer of their progress.\nAs tree after tree came whistling down, he cast his eyes upward at the\nvacancies they left in the heavens, with a melancholy gaze, and finally\nturned away, muttering to himself with a bitter smile, like one who\ndisdained giving a more audible utterance to his discontent. Pressing\nthrough the group of active and busy children, who had already lighted\na cheerful fire, the attention of the old man became next fixed on\nthe movements of the leader of the emigrants and of his savage looking\nassistant.\n\nThese two had, already, liberated the cattle, which were eagerly\nbrowsing the grateful and nutritious extremities of the fallen trees,\nand were now employed about the wagon, which has been described\nas having its contents concealed with so much apparent care.\nNotwithstanding this particular conveyance appeared to be as silent,\nand as tenantless as the rest of the vehicles, the men applied their\nstrength to its wheels, and rolled it apart from the others, to a dry\nand elevated spot, near the edge of the thicket. Here they brought\ncertain poles, which had, seemingly, been long employed in such a\nservice, and fastening their larger ends firmly in the ground, the\nsmaller were attached to the hoops that supported the covering of the\nwagon. Large folds of cloth were next drawn out of the vehicle, and\nafter being spread around the whole, were pegged to the earth in such\na manner as to form a tolerably capacious and an exceedingly convenient\ntent. After surveying their work with inquisitive, and perhaps jealous\neyes, arranging a fold here, and driving a peg more firmly there, the\nmen once more applied their strength to the wagon, pulling it, by its\nprojecting tongue, from the centre of the canopy, until it appeared\nin the open air, deprived of its covering, and destitute of any other\nfreight, than a few light articles of furniture. The latter were\nimmediately removed, by the traveller, into the tent with his own\nhands, as though to enter it, were a privilege, to which even his bosom\ncompanion was not entitled.\n\nCuriosity is a passion that is rather quickened than destroyed by\nseclusion, and the old inhabitant of the prairies did not view these\nprecautionary and mysterious movements, without experiencing some of\nits impulses. He approached the tent, and was about to sever two of its\nfolds, with the very obvious intention of examining, more closely, into\nthe nature of its contents, when the man who had once already placed his\nlife in jeopardy, seized him by the arm, and with a rude exercise of\nhis strength threw him from the spot he had selected as the one most\nconvenient for his object.\n\n\"It's an honest regulation, friend,\" the fellow, drily observed, though\nwith an eye that threatened volumes, \"and sometimes it is a safe one,\nwhich says, mind your own business.\"\n\n\"Men seldom bring any thing to be concealed into these deserts,\"\nreturned the old man, as if willing, and yet a little ignorant how to\napologize for the liberty he had been about to take, \"and I had hoped no\noffence, in examining your comforts.\"\n\n\"They seldom bring themselves, I reckon; though this has the look of an\nold country, to my eye it seems not to be overly peopled.\"\n\n\"The land is as aged as the rest of the works of the Lord, I believe;\nbut you say true, concerning its inhabitants. Many months have passed\nsince I have laid eyes on a face of my own colour, before your own.\nI say again, friend, I meant no harm; I did not know, but there was\nsomething behind the cloth, that might bring former days to my mind.\"\n\nAs the stranger ended his simple explanation, he walked meekly away,\nlike one who felt the deepest sense of the right which every man has to\nthe quiet enjoyment of his own, without any troublesome interference on\nthe part of his neighbour; a wholesome and just principle that he had,\nalso, most probably imbibed from the habits of his secluded life. As\nhe passed towards the little encampment of the emigrants, for such the\nplace had now become, he heard the voice of the leader calling aloud, in\nits hoarse tones, the name of--\n\n\"Ellen Wade.\"\n\nThe girl who has been already introduced to the reader, and who was\noccupied with the others of her sex around the fires, sprang willingly\nforward at this summons; and, passing the stranger with the activity of\na young antelope, she was instantly lost behind the forbidden folds of\nthe tent. Neither her sudden disappearance, nor any of the arrangements\nwe have mentioned, seemed, however, to excite the smallest surprise\namong the remainder of the party. The young men, who had already\ncompleted their tasks with the axe, were all engaged after their\nlounging and listless manner; some in bestowing equitable portions\nof the fodder among the different animals; others in plying the heavy\npestle of a moveable homminy-mortar[*]; and one or two in wheeling the\nremainder of the wagons aside, and arranging them in such a manner as to\nform a sort of outwork for their otherwise defenceless bivouac.\n\n    [*] Homminy, is a dish composed chiefly of cracked corn, or maize.\n\nThese several duties were soon performed, and, as darkness now began\nto conceal the objects on the surrounding prairie, the shrill-toned\ntermagant, whose voice since the halt had been diligently exercised\namong her idle and drowsy offspring, announced, in tones that might have\nbeen heard at a dangerous distance, that the evening meal waited only\nfor the approach of those who were to consume it. Whatever may be the\nother qualities of a border man, he is seldom deficient in the virtue\nof hospitality. The emigrant no sooner heard the sharp call of his wife,\nthan he cast his eyes about him in quest of the stranger, in order to\noffer him the place of distinction, in the rude entertainment to which\nthey were so unceremoniously summoned.\n\n\"I thank you, friend,\" the old man replied to the rough invitation to\ntake a seat nigh the smoking kettle; \"you have my hearty thanks; but\nI have eaten for the day, and am not one of them, who dig their graves\nwith their teeth. Well; as you wish it, I will take a place, for it is\nlong sin' I have seen people of my colour, eating their daily bread.\"\n\n\"You ar' an old settler, in these districts, then?\" the emigrant rather\nremarked than enquired, with a mouth filled nearly to overflowing with\nthe delicious homminy, prepared by his skilful, though repulsive\nspouse. \"They told us below, we should find settlers something thinnish,\nhereaway, and I must say, the report was mainly true; for, unless, we\ncount the Canada traders on the big river, you ar' the first white face\nI have met, in a good five hundred miles; that is calculating according\nto your own reckoning.\"\n\n\"Though I have spent some years, in this quarter, I can hardly be called\na settler, seeing that I have no regular abode, and seldom pass more\nthan a month, at a time, on the same range.\"\n\n\"A hunter, I reckon?\" the other continued, glancing his eyes aside, as\nif to examine the equipments of his new acquaintance; \"your fixen seem\nnone of the best, for such a calling.\"\n\n\"They are old, and nearly ready to be laid aside, like their master,\"\nsaid the old man, regarding his rifle, with a look in which affection\nand regret were singularly blended; \"and I may say they are but little\nneeded, too. You are mistaken, friend, in calling me a hunter; I am\nnothing better than a trapper.\"[*]\n\n    [*] It is scarcely necessary to say, that this American word means one\n    who takes his game in a trap. It is of general use on the\n    frontiers. The beaver, an animal too sagacious to be easily\n    killed, is oftener taken in this way than in any other.\n\n\"If you ar' much of the one, I'm bold to say you ar' something of the\nother; for the two callings, go mainly together, in these districts.\"\n\n\"To the shame of the man who is able to follow the first be it so said!\"\nreturned the trapper, whom in future we shall choose to designate by\nhis pursuit; \"for more than fifty years did I carry my rifle in the\nwilderness, without so much as setting a snare for even a bird that\nflies the heavens;--much less, a beast that has nothing but legs, for\nits gifts.\"\n\n\"I see but little difference whether a man gets his peltry by the rifle\nor by the trap,\" said the ill-looking companion of the emigrant, in his\nrough manner. \"The 'arth was made for our comfort; and, for that matter,\nso ar' its creatur's.\"\n\n\"You seem to have but little plunder,[*] stranger, for one who is far\nabroad,\" bluntly interrupted the emigrant, as if he had a reason for\nwishing to change the conversation. \"I hope you ar' better off for\nskins.\"\n\n    [*] The cant word for luggage in the western states of America is\n    \"plunder.\" The term might easily mislead one as to the character\n    of the people, who, notwithstanding their pleasant use of so\n    expressive a word, are, like the inhabitants of all new\n    settlements, hospitable and honest. Knavery of the description\n    conveyed by \"plunder,\" is chiefly found in regions more civilised.\n\n\"I make but little use of either,\" the trapper quietly replied. \"At my\ntime of life, food and clothing be all that is needed; and I have little\noccasion for what you call plunder, unless it may be, now and then, to\nbarter for a horn of powder, or a bar of lead.\"\n\n\"You ar' not, then, of these parts by natur', friend,\" the emigrant\ncontinued, having in his mind the exception which the other had taken\nto the very equivocal word, which he himself, according to the custom of\nthe country, had used for \"baggage,\" or \"effects.\"\n\n\"I was born on the sea-shore, though most of my life has been passed in\nthe woods.\"\n\nThe whole party now looked up at him, as men are apt to turn their eyes\non some unexpected object of general interest. One or two of the young\nmen repeated the words \"sea-shore\" and the woman tendered him one\nof those civilities with which, uncouth as they were, she was little\naccustomed to grace her hospitality, as if in deference to the travelled\ndignity of her guest. After a long, and, seemingly, a meditating\nsilence, the emigrant, who had, however, seen no apparent necessity to\nsuspend the functions of his masticating powers, resumed the discourse.\n\n\"It is a long road, as I have heard, from the waters of the west to the\nshores of the main sea?\"\n\n\"It is a weary path, indeed, friend; and much have I seen, and something\nhave I suffered, in journeying over it.\"\n\n\"A man would see a good deal of hard travel in going its length!\"\n\n\"Seventy and five years have I been upon the road; and there are not\nhalf that number of leagues in the whole distance, after you leave the\nHudson, on which I have not tasted venison of my own killing. But this\nis vain boasting. Of what use are former deeds, when time draws to an\nend?\"\n\n\"I once met a man that had boated on the river he names,\" observed the\neldest son, speaking in a low tone of voice, like one who distrusted his\nknowledge, and deemed it prudent to assume a becoming diffidence in the\npresence of a man who had seen so much: \"from his tell, it must be\na considerable stream, and deep enough for a keel-boat, from top to\nbottom.\"\n\n\"It is a wide and deep water-course, and many sightly towns are there\ngrowing on its banks,\" returned the trapper; \"and yet it is but a brook\nto the waters of the endless river.\"\n\n\"I call nothing a stream that a man can travel round,\" exclaimed the\nill-looking associate of the emigrant: \"a real river must be crossed;\nnot headed, like a bear in a county hunt.\"[*]\n\n    [*] There is a practice, in the new countries, to assemble the men of\n    a large district, sometimes of an entire county, to exterminate\n    the beasts of prey. They form themselves into a circle of several\n    miles in extent, and gradually draw nearer, killing all before\n    them. The allusion is to this custom, in which the hunted beast is\n    turned from one to another.\n\n\"Have you been far towards the sun-down, friend?\" interrupted the\nemigrant, as if he desired to keep his rough companion as much as\npossible out of the discourse. \"I find it is a wide tract of clearing,\nthis, into which I have fallen.\"\n\n\"You may travel weeks, and you will see it the same. I often think the\nLord has placed this barren belt of prairie behind the States, to\nwarn men to what their folly may yet bring the land! Ay, weeks, if not\nmonths, may you journey in these open fields, in which there is neither\ndwelling nor habitation for man or beast. Even the savage animals travel\nmiles on miles to seek their dens; and yet the wind seldom blows from\nthe east, but I conceit the sound of axes, and the crash of falling\ntrees, are in my ears.\"\n\nAs the old man spoke with the seriousness and dignity that age seldom\nfails to communicate even to less striking sentiments, his auditors were\ndeeply attentive, and as silent as the grave. Indeed, the trapper\nwas left to renew the dialogue himself, which he soon did by asking\na question, in the indirect manner so much in use by the border\ninhabitants.\n\n\"You found it no easy matter to ford the water-courses, and to make your\nway so deep into the prairies, friend, with teams of horses and herds of\nhorned beasts?\"\n\n\"I kept the left bank of the main river,\" the emigrant replied, \"until I\nfound the stream leading too much to the north, when we rafted ourselves\nacross without any great suffering. The women lost a fleece or two\nfrom the next year's shearing, and the girls have one cow less to their\ndairy. Since then, we have done bravely, by bridging a creek every day\nor two.\"\n\n\"It is likely you will continue west, until you come to land more\nsuitable for a settlement?\"\n\n\"Until I see reason to stop, or to turn ag'in,\" the emigrant bluntly\nanswered, rising at the same time, and cutting short the dialogue by the\nsuddenness of the movement. His example was followed by the trapper, as\nwell as the rest of the party; and then, without much deference to\nthe presence of their guest, the travellers proceeded to make their\ndispositions to pass the night. Several little bowers, or rather huts,\nhad already been formed of the tops of trees, blankets of coarse country\nmanufacture, and the skins of buffaloes, united without much reference\nto any other object than temporary comfort. Into these covers the\nchildren, with their mother, soon drew themselves, and where, it is more\nthan possible, they were all speedily lost in the oblivion of sleep.\nBefore the men, however, could seek their rest, they had sundry little\nduties to perform; such as completing their works of defence, carefully\nconcealing the fires, replenishing the fodder of their cattle, and\nsetting the watch that was to protect the party, in the approaching\nhours of night.\n\nThe former was effected by dragging the trunks of a few trees into\nthe intervals left by the wagons, and along the open space between the\nvehicles and the thicket, on which, in military language, the encampment\nwould be said to have rested; thus forming a sort of chevaux-de-frise\non three sides of the position. Within these narrow limits (with the\nexception of what the tent contained), both man and beast were now\ncollected; the latter being far too happy in resting their weary\nlimbs, to give any undue annoyance to their scarcely more intelligent\nassociates. Two of the young men took their rifles; and, first renewing\nthe priming, and examining the flints with the utmost care, they\nproceeded, the one to the extreme right, and the other to the left, of\nthe encampment, where they posted themselves within the shadows of the\nthicket; but in such positions as enabled each to overlook a portion of\nthe prairie.\n\nThe trapper loitered about the place, declining to share the straw\nof the emigrant, until the whole arrangement was completed; and then,\nwithout the ceremony of an adieu, he slowly retired from the spot.\n\nIt was now in the first watch of the night; and the pale, quivering, and\ndeceptive light, from a new moon, was playing over the endless waves of\nthe prairie, tipping the swells with gleams of brightness, and leaving\nthe interval land in deep shadow. Accustomed to scenes of solitude like\nthe present, the old man, as he left the encampment, proceeded alone\ninto the waste, like a bold vessel leaving its haven to enter on the\ntrackless field of the ocean. He appeared to move for some time without\nobject, or, indeed, without any apparent consciousness, whither his\nlimbs were carrying him. At length, on reaching the rise of one of the\nundulations, he came to a stand; and, for the first time since leaving\nthe band, who had caused such a flood of reflections and recollections\nto crowd upon his mind, the old man became aware of his present\nsituation. Throwing one end of his rifle to the earth, he stood leaning\non the other, again lost in deep contemplation for several minutes,\nduring which time his hound came and crouched at his feet. A deep,\nmenacing growl, from the faithful animal, first aroused him from his\nmusing.\n\n\"What now, dog?\" he said, looking down at his companion, as if he\naddressed a being of an intelligence equal to his own, and speaking in\na voice of great affection. \"What is it, pup? ha! Hector; what is it\nnosing, now? It won't do, dog; it won't do; the very fa'ns play in open\nview of us, without minding so worn out curs, as you and I. Instinct\nis their gift, Hector and, they have found out how little we are to be\nfeared, they have!\"\n\nThe dog stretched his head upward, and responded to the words of his\nmaster by a long and plaintive whine, which he even continued after he\nhad again buried his head in the grass, as if he held an intelligent\ncommunication with one who so well knew how to interpret dumb discourse.\n\n\"This is a manifest warning, Hector!\" the trapper continued, dropping\nhis voice, to the tones of caution and looking warily about him. \"What\nis it, pup; speak plainer, dog; what is it?\"\n\nThe hound had, however, already laid his nose to the earth, and was\nsilent; appearing to slumber. But the keen quick glances of his master,\nsoon caught a glimpse of a distant figure, which seemed, through the\ndeceptive light, floating along the very elevation on which he had\nplaced himself. Presently its proportions became more distinct, and then\nan airy, female form appeared to hesitate, as if considering whether it\nwould be prudent to advance. Though the eyes of the dog were now to be\nseen glancing in the rays of the moon, opening and shutting lazily, he\ngave no further signs of displeasure.\n\n\"Come nigher; we are friends,\" said the trapper, associating himself\nwith his companion by long use, and, probably, through the strength of\nthe secret tie that connected them together; \"we are your friends; none\nwill harm you.\"\n\nEncouraged by the mild tones of his voice, and perhaps led on by the\nearnestness of her purpose, the female approached, until she stood at\nhis side; when the old man perceived his visitor to be the young woman,\nwith whom the reader, has already become acquainted by the name of\n\"Ellen Wade.\"\n\n\"I had thought you were gone,\" she said, looking timidly and anxiously\naround. \"They said you were gone; and that we should never see you\nagain. I did not think it was you!\"\n\n\"Men are no common objects in these empty fields,\" returned the trapper,\n\"and I humbly hope, though I have so long consorted with the beasts of\nthe wilderness, that I have not yet lost the look of my kind.\"\n\n\"Oh! I knew you to be a man, and I thought I knew the whine of the\nhound, too,\" she answered hastily, as if willing to explain she knew not\nwhat, and then checking herself, like one fearful of having already said\ntoo much.\n\n\"I saw no dogs, among the teams of your father,\" the trapper remarked.\n\n\"Father!\" exclaimed the girl, feelingly, \"I have no father! I had nearly\nsaid no friend.\"\n\nThe old man turned towards her, with a look of kindness and interest,\nthat was even more conciliating than the ordinary, upright, and\nbenevolent expression of his weather-beaten countenance.\n\n\"Why then do you venture in a place where none but the strong should\ncome?\" he demanded. \"Did you not know that, when you crossed the big\nriver, you left a friend behind you that is always bound to look to the\nyoung and feeble, like yourself.\"\n\n\"Of whom do you speak?\"\n\n\"The law--'tis bad to have it, but, I sometimes think, it is worse to\nbe entirely without it. Age and weakness have brought me to feel such\nweakness, at times. Yes--yes, the law is needed, when such as have not\nthe gifts of strength and wisdom are to be taken care of. I hope, young\nwoman, if you have no father, you have at least a brother.\"\n\nThe maiden felt the tacit reproach conveyed in this covert question,\nand for a moment she remained in an embarrassed silence. But catching\na glimpse of the mild and serious features of her companion, as he\ncontinued to gaze on her with a look of interest, she replied, firmly,\nand in a manner that left no doubt she comprehended his meaning:\n\n\"Heaven forbid that any such as you have seen, should be a brother of\nmine, or any thing else near or dear to me! But, tell me, do you then\nactually live alone, in this desert district, old man; is there really\nnone here besides yourself?\"\n\n\"There are hundreds, nay, thousands of the rightful owners of the\ncountry, roving about the plains; but few of our own colour.\"\n\n\"And have you then met none who are white, but us?\" interrupted the\ngirl, like one too impatient to await the tardy explanations of age and\ndeliberation.\n\n\"Not in many days--Hush, Hector, hush,\" he added in reply to a low, and\nnearly inaudible, growl from his hound. \"The dog scents mischief in the\nwind! The black bears from the mountains sometimes make their way, even\nlower than this. The pup is not apt to complain of the harmless game.\nI am not so ready and true with the piece as I used-to-could-be, yet I\nhave struck even the fiercest animals of the prairie in my time; so, you\nhave little reason for fear, young woman.\"\n\nThe girl raised her eyes, in that peculiar manner which is so often\npractised by her sex, when they commence their glances, by examining the\nearth at their feet, and terminate them by noting every thing within\nthe power of human vision; but she rather manifested the quality of\nimpatience, than any feeling of alarm.\n\nA short bark from the dog, however, soon gave a new direction to the\nlooks of both, and then the real object of his second warning became\ndimly visible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n   Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood, as any in Italy;\n   and as soon mov'd to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.\n                                             --Romeo and Juliet.\n\nThough the trapper manifested some surprise when he perceived that\nanother human figure was approaching him, and that, too, from a\ndirection opposite to the place where the emigrant had made his\nencampment, it was with the steadiness of one long accustomed to scenes\nof danger.\n\n\"This is a man,\" he said; \"and one who has white blood in his veins, or\nhis step would be lighter. It will be well to be ready for the worst, as\nthe half-and-halfs,[*] that one meets, in these distant districts, are\naltogether more barbarous than the real savage.\"\n\n    [*] Half-breeds; men born of Indian women by white fathers. This race\n    has much of the depravity of civilisation without the virtues of\n    the savage.\n\nHe raised his rifle while he spoke, and assured himself of the state of\nits flint, as well as of the priming by manual examination. But his arm\nwas arrested, while in the act of throwing forward the muzzle of the\npiece, by the eager and trembling hands of his companion.\n\n\"For God's sake, be not too hasty,\" she said; \"it may be a friend--an\nacquaintance--a neighbour!\"\n\n\"A friend!\" the old man repeated, deliberately releasing himself, at the\nsame time, from her grasp. \"Friends are rare in any land, and less in\nthis, perhaps, than in another; and the neighbourhood is too thinly\nsettled to make it likely that he who comes towards us is even an\nacquaintance.\"\n\n\"But though a stranger, you would not seek his blood!\"\n\nThe trapper earnestly regarded her anxious and frightened features,\nand then he dropped the butt of his rifle on the ground, like one whose\npurpose had undergone a sudden change.\n\n\"No,\" he said, speaking rather to himself, than to his companion, \"she\nis right; blood is not to be spilt, to save the life of one so useless,\nand so near his time. Let him come on; my skins, my traps, and even my\nrifle shall be his, if he sees fit to demand them.\"\n\n\"He will ask for neither:--he wants neither,\" returned the girl; \"if he\nbe an honest man, he will surely be content with his own, and ask for\nnothing that is the property of another.\"\n\nThe trapper had not time to express the surprise he felt at this\nincoherent and contradictory language, for the man who was advancing,\nwas, already, within fifty feet of the place where they stood.--In\nthe mean time, Hector had not been an indifferent witness of what was\npassing. At the sound of the distant footsteps, he had arisen, from his\nwarm bed at the feet of his master; and now, as the stranger appeared in\nopen view, he stalked slowly towards him, crouching to the earth like a\npanther about to take his leap.\n\n\"Call in your dog,\" said a firm, deep, manly voice, in tones of\nfriendship, rather than of menace; \"I love a hound, and should be sorry\nto do an injury to the animal.\"\n\n\"You hear what is said about you, pup?\" the trapper answered; \"come\nhither, fool. His growl and his bark are all that is left him now; you\nmay come on, friend; the hound is toothless.\"\n\nThe stranger profited by the intelligence. He sprang eagerly forward,\nand at the next instant stood at the side of Ellen Wade. After assuring\nhimself of the identity of the latter, by a hasty but keen glance, he\nturned his attention, with a quickness and impatience, that proved\nthe interest he took in the result, to a similar examination of her\ncompanion.\n\n\"From what cloud have you fallen, my good old man?\" he said in a\ncareless, off-hand, heedless manner that seemed too natural to be\nassumed: \"or do you actually live, hereaway, in the prairies?\"\n\n\"I have been long on earth, and never I hope nigher to heaven, than I am\nat this moment,\" returned the trapper; \"my dwelling, if dwelling I may\nbe said to have, is not far distant. Now may I take the liberty with\nyou, that you are so willing to take with others? Whence do you come,\nand where is your home?\"\n\n\"Softly, softly; when I have done with my catechism, it will be time to\nbegin with yours. What sport is this, you follow by moonlight? You are\nnot dodging the buffaloes at such an hour!\"\n\n\"I am, as you see, going from an encampment of travellers, which lies\nover yonder swell in the land, to my own wigwam; in doing so, I wrong no\nman.\"\n\n\"All fair and true. And you got this young woman to show you the way,\nbecause she knows it so well and you know so little about it yourself!\"\n\n\"I met her, as I have met you, by accident. For ten tiresome years have\nI dwelt on these open fields, and never, before to-night, have I found\nhuman beings with white skins on them, at this hour. If my presence here\ngives offence, I am sorry; and will go my way. It is more than likely\nthat when your young friend has told her story, you will be better given\nto believe mine.\n\n\"Friend!\" said the youth, lifting a cap of skins from his head, and\nrunning his fingers leisurely through a dense mass of black and shaggy\nlocks, \"if I have ever laid eyes on the girl before to-night, may I--\"\n\n\"You've said enough, Paul,\" interrupted the female, laying her hand\non his mouth, with a familiarity that gave something very like the lie\ndirect, to his intended asseveration. \"Our secret will be safe, with\nthis honest old man. I know it by his looks, and kind words.\"\n\n\"Our secret! Ellen, have you forgot--\"\n\n\"Nothing. I have not forgotten any thing I should remember. But still I\nsay we are safe with this honest trapper.\"\n\n\"Trapper! is he then a trapper? Give me your hand, father; our trades\nshould bring us acquainted.\"\n\n\"There is little call for handicrafts in this region,\" returned the\nother, examining the athletic and active form of the youth, as he leaned\ncarelessly and not ungracefully, on his rifle; \"the art of taking the\ncreatur's of God, in traps and nets, is one that needs more cunning than\nmanhood; and yet am I brought to practise it, in my age! But it would\nbe quite as seemly, in one like you, to follow a pursuit better becoming\nyour years and courage.\"\n\n\"I! I never took even a slinking mink or a paddling musk-rat in a cage;\nthough I admit having peppered a few of the dark-skin'd devils, when\nI had much better have kept my powder in the horn and the lead in its\npouch. Not I, old man; nothing that crawls the earth is for my sport.\"\n\n\"What then may you do for a living, friend? for little profit is to be\nmade in these districts, if a man denies himself his lawful right in the\nbeasts of the fields.\"\n\n\"I deny myself nothing. If a bear crosses my path, he is soon the mere\nghost of Bruin. The deer begin to nose me; and as for the buffaloe, I\nhave kill'd more beef, old stranger, than the largest butcher in all\nKentuck.\"\n\n\"You can shoot, then!\" demanded the trapper, with a glow of latent fire,\nglimmering about his eyes; \"is your hand true, and your look quick?\"\n\n\"The first is like a steel trap, and the last nimbler than a buck-shot.\nI wish it was hot noon, now, grand'ther; and that there was an acre or\ntwo of your white swans or of black feathered ducks going south, over\nour heads; you or Ellen, here, might set your heart on the finest in the\nflock, and my character against a horn of powder, that the bird would\nbe hanging head downwards, in five minutes, and that too, with a single\nball. I scorn a shot-gun! No man can say, he ever knew me carry one, a\nrod.\"\n\n\"The lad has good in him! I see it plainly by his manner;\" said the\ntrapper, turning to Ellen with an encouraging air; \"I will take it on\nmyself to say, that you are not unwise in meeting him, as you do. Tell\nme, lad; did you ever strike a leaping buck atwixt the antlers? Hector;\nquiet, pup; quiet. The very name of venison quickens the blood of the\ncur;--did you ever take an animal in that fashion, on the long leap?\"\n\n\"You might just as well ask me, did you ever eat? There is no fashion,\nold stranger, that a deer has not been touched by my hand, unless it was\nwhen asleep.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay; you have a long and a happy-ay, and an honest life afore you! I\nam old, and I suppose I might also say, worn out and useless; but, if\nit was given me to choose my time, and place, again,--as such things are\nnot and ought not ever to be given to the will of man--though if such\na gift was to be given me, I would say, twenty and the wilderness! But,\ntell me; how do you part with the peltry?\"\n\n\"With my pelts! I never took a skin from a buck, nor a quill from a\ngoose, in my life! I knock them over, now and then, for a meal, and\nsometimes to keep my finger true to the touch; but when hunger is\nsatisfied, the prairie wolves get the remainder. No--no--I keep to my\ncalling; which pays me better, than all the fur I could sell on the\nother side of the big river.\"\n\nThe old man appeared to ponder a little; but shaking his head he soon\ncontinued--\n\n\"I know of but one business that can be followed here with profit--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by the youth, who raised a small cup of tin, which\ndangled at his neck before the other's eyes, and springing its lid, the\ndelicious odour of the finest flavoured honey, diffused itself over the\norgans of the trapper.\n\n\"A bee hunter!\" observed the latter, with a readiness that proved he\nunderstood the nature of the occupation, though not without some little\nsurprise at discovering one of the other's spirited mien engaged in so\nhumble a pursuit. \"It pays well in the skirts of the settlements, but I\nshould call it a doubtful trade, in the more open districts.\"\n\n\"You think a tree is wanting for a swarm to settle in! But I know\ndifferently; and so I have stretched out a few hundred miles farther\nwest than common, to taste your honey. And, now, I have bated your\ncuriosity, stranger, you will just move aside, while I tell the\nremainder of my story to this young woman.\"\n\n\"It is not necessary, I'm sure it is not necessary, that he should leave\nus,\" said Ellen, with a haste that implied some little consciousness of\nthe singularity if not of the impropriety of the request. \"You can have\nnothing to say that the whole world might not hear.\"\n\n\"No! well, may I be stung to death by drones, if I understand the\nbuzzings of a woman's mind! For my part, Ellen, I care for nothing nor\nany body; and am just as ready to go down to the place where your uncle,\nif uncle you can call one, who I'll swear is no relation, has hoppled\nhis teams, and tell the old man my mind now, as I shall be a year hence.\nYou have only to say a single word, and the thing is done; let him like\nit or not.\"\n\n\"You are ever so hasty and so rash, Paul Hover, that I seldom know when\nI am safe with you. How can you, who know the danger of our being seen\ntogether, speak of going before my uncle and his sons?\"\n\n\"Has he done that of which he has reason to be ashamed?\" demanded the\ntrapper, who had not moved an inch from the place he first occupied.\n\n\"Heaven forbid! But there are reasons, why he should not be seen, just\nnow, that could do him no harm if known; but which may not yet be told.\nAnd, so, if you will wait, father, near yonder willow bush, until I have\nheard what Paul can possibly have to say, I shall be sure to come and\nwish you a good night, before I return to the camp.\"\n\nThe trapper drew slowly aside, as if satisfied with the somewhat\nincoherent reason Ellen had given why he should retire. When completely\nout of ear shot of the earnest and hurried dialogue, that instantly\ncommenced between the two he had left, the old man again paused, and\npatiently awaited the moment when he might renew his conversation with\nbeings in whom he felt a growing interest, no less from the mysterious\ncharacter of their intercourse, than from a natural sympathy in the\nwelfare of a pair so young, and who, as in the simplicity of his heart\nhe was also fain to believe, were also so deserving. He was accompanied\nby his indolent, but attached dog, who once more made his bed at the\nfeet of his master, and soon lay slumbering as usual, with his head\nnearly buried in the dense fog of the prairie grass.\n\nIt was a spectacle so unusual to see the human form amid the solitude in\nwhich he dwelt, that the trapper bent his eyes on the dim figures of his\nnew acquaintances, with sensations to which he had long been a stranger.\nTheir presence awakened recollections and emotions, to which his sturdy\nbut honest nature had latterly paid but little homage, and his thoughts\nbegan to wander over the varied scenes of a life of hardships, that had\nbeen strangely blended with scenes of wild and peculiar enjoyment. The\ntrain taken by his thoughts had, already, conducted him, in imagination,\nfar into an ideal world, when he was, once more suddenly, recalled to\nthe reality of his situation, by the movements of the faithful hound.\n\nThe dog, who, in submission to his years and infirmities, had manifested\nsuch a decided propensity to sleep, now arose, and stalked from out the\nshadow cast by the tall person of his master, and looked abroad into\nthe prairie, as if his instinct apprised him of the presence of still\nanother visitor. Then, seemingly content with his examination, he\nreturned to his comfortable post and disposed of his weary limbs,\nwith the deliberation and care of one who was no novice in the art of\nself-preservation.\n\n\"What; again, Hector!\" said the trapper in a soothing voice, which he\nhad the caution, however, to utter in an under tone; \"what is it, dog?\ntell it all to his master, pup; what is it?\"\n\nHector answered with another growl, but was content to continue in his\nlair. These were evidences of intelligence and distrust, to which one\nas practised as the trapper could not turn an inattentive ear. He again\nspoke to the dog, encouraging him to watchfulness, by a low guarded\nwhistle. The animal however, as if conscious of having, already,\ndischarged his duty, obstinately refused to raise his head from the\ngrass.\n\n\"A hint from such a friend is far better than man's advice!\" muttered\nthe trapper, as he slowly moved towards the couple who were yet, too\nearnestly and abstractedly, engaged in their own discourse, to notice\nhis approach; \"and none but a conceited settler would hear it and\nnot respect it, as he ought. Children,\" he added, when nigh enough to\naddress his companions, \"we are not alone in these dreary fields; there\nare others stirring, and, therefore, to the shame of our kind, be it\nsaid, danger is nigh.\"\n\n\"If one of the lazy sons of Skirting Ishmael is prowling out of his camp\nto-night,\" said the young bee-hunter, with great vivacity, and in tones\nthat might easily have been excited to a menace, \"he may have an end put\nto his journey sooner than either he or his father is dreaming!\"\n\n\"My life on it, they are all with the teams,\" hurriedly answered the\ngirl. \"I saw the whole of them asleep, myself, except the two on watch;\nand their natures have greatly changed, if they, too, are not both\ndreaming of a turkey hunt, or a court-house fight, at this very moment.\"\n\n\"Some beast, with a strong scent, has passed between the wind and the\nhound, father, and it makes him uneasy; or, perhaps, he too is dreaming.\nI had a pup of my own, in Kentuck, that would start upon a long chase\nfrom a deep sleep; and all upon the fancy of some dream. Go to him, and\npinch his ear, that the beast may feel the life within him.\"\n\n\"Not so--not so,\" returned the trapper, shaking his head as one who\nbetter understood the qualities of his dog.--\"Youth sleeps, ay, and\ndreams too; but age is awake and watchful. The pup is never false with\nhis nose, and long experience tells me to heed his warnings.\"\n\n\"Did you ever run him upon the trail of carrion?\"\n\n\"Why, I must say, that the ravenous beasts have sometimes tempted me to\nlet him loose, for they are as greedy as men, after the venison, in\nits season; but then I knew the reason of the dog, would tell him the\nobject!--No--no, Hector is an animal known in the ways of man, and will\nnever strike a false trail when a true one is to be followed!\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, the secret is out! you have run the hound on the track of\na wolf, and his nose has a better memory than his master!\" said the\nbee-hunter, laughing.\n\n\"I have seen the creatur' sleep for hours, with pack after pack, in open\nview. A wolf might eat out of his tray without a snarl, unless there was\na scarcity; then, indeed, Hector would be apt to claim his own.\"\n\n\"There are panthers down from the mountains; I saw one make a leap at a\nsick deer, as the sun was setting. Go; go you back to the dog, and tell\nhim the truth, father; in a minute, I--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a long, loud, and piteous howl from the hound,\nwhich rose on the air of the evening, like the wailing of some spirit\nof the place, and passed off into the prairie, in cadences that rose\nand fell, like its own undulating surface. The trapper was impressively\nsilent, listening intently. Even the reckless bee-hunter, was struck\nwith the wailing wildness of the sounds. After a short pause the former\nwhistled the dog to his side, and turning to his companions he said with\nthe seriousness, which, in his opinion, the occasion demanded--\n\n\"They who think man enjoys all the knowledge of the creatur's of God,\nwill live to be disappointed, if they reach, as I have done, the age\nof fourscore years. I will not take upon myself to say what mischief is\nbrewing, nor will I vouch that, even, the hound himself knows so much;\nbut that evil is nigh, and that wisdom invites us to avoid it, I have\nheard from the mouth of one who never lies. I did think, the pup had\nbecome unused to the footsteps of man, and that your presence made him\nuneasy; but his nose has been on a long scent the whole evening,\nand what I mistook as a notice of your coming, has been intended for\nsomething more serious. If the advice of an old man is, then, worth\nhearkening to, children, you will quickly go different ways to your\nplaces of shelter and safety.\"\n\n\"If I quit Ellen, at such a moment,\" exclaimed the youth, \"may I--\"\n\n\"You've said enough!\" the girl interrupted, by again interposing a band\nthat might, both by its delicacy and colour, have graced a far more\nelevated station in life; \"my time is out; and we must part, at all\nevents--so good night, Paul--father--good night.\"\n\n\"Hist!\" said the youth, seizing her arm, as she was in the very act of\ntripping from his side--\"Hist! do you hear nothing? There are buffaloes\nplaying their pranks, at no great distance--That sound beats the earth\nlike a herd of the mad scampering devils!\"\n\nHis two companions listened, as people in their situation would be apt\nto lend their faculties to discover the meaning of any doubtful noises,\nespecially, when heard after so many and such startling warnings. The\nunusual sounds were unequivocally though still faintly audible. The\nyouth and his female companion had made several hurried, and vacillating\nconjectures concerning their nature, when a current of the night air\nbrought the rush of trampling footsteps, too sensibly, to their ears, to\nrender mistake any longer possible.\n\n\"I am right!\" said the bee-hunter; \"a panther is driving a herd before\nhim; or may be, there is a battle among the beasts.\"\n\n\"Your ears are cheats,\" returned the old man, who, from the moment\nhis own organs had been able to catch the distant sounds, stood like a\nstatue made to represent deep attention:--\"the leaps are too long for\nthe buffaloe, and too regular for terror. Hist! now they are in a bottom\nwhere the grass is high, and the sound is deadened! Ay, there they go on\nthe hard earth! And now they come up the swell, dead upon us; they will\nbe here afore you can find a cover!\"\n\n\"Come, Ellen,\" cried the youth, seizing his companion by the hand, \"let\nus make a trial for the encampment.\"\n\n\"Too late! too late!\" exclaimed the trapper, \"for the creatur's are\nin open view; and a bloody band of accursed Siouxes they are, by their\nthieving look, and the random fashion in which they ride!\"\n\n\"Siouxes or devils, they shall find us men!\" said the bee-hunter, with\na mien as fierce as if he led a party of superior strength, and of a\ncourage equal to his own.--\"You have a piece, old man, and will pull a\ntrigger in behalf of a helpless, Christian girl!\"\n\n\"Down, down into the grass--down with ye both,\" whispered the trapper,\nintimating to them to turn aside to the tall weeds, which grew, in a\ndenser body than common, near the place where they stood. \"You've not\nthe time to fly, nor the numbers to fight, foolish boy. Down into the\ngrass, if you prize the young woman, or value the gift of life!\"\n\nHis remonstrance, seconded, as it was, by a prompt and energetic action,\ndid not fail to produce the submission to his order, which the occasion\nseemed, indeed, imperiously to require. The moon had fallen behind a\nsheet of thin, fleecy, clouds, which skirted the horizon, leaving just\nenough of its faint and fluctuating light, to render objects visible,\ndimly revealing their forms and proportions. The trapper, by exercising\nthat species of influence, over his companions, which experience\nand decision usually assert, in cases of emergency, had effectually\nsucceeded in concealing them in the grass, and by the aid of the feeble\nrays of the luminary, he was enabled to scan the disorderly party which\nwas riding, like so many madmen, directly upon them.\n\nA band of beings, who resembled demons rather than men, sporting in\ntheir nightly revels across the bleak plain, was in truth approaching,\nat a fearful rate, and in a direction to leave little hope that some one\namong them, at least, would not pass over the spot where the trapper\nand his companions lay. At intervals, the clattering of hoofs was borne\nalong by the night wind, quite audibly in their front, and then, again,\ntheir progress through the fog of the autumnal grass, was swift and\nsilent; adding to the unearthly appearance of the spectacle. The\ntrapper, who had called in his hound, and bidden him crouch at his side,\nnow kneeled in the cover also, and kept a keen and watchful eye on the\nroute of the band, soothing the fears of the girl, and restraining the\nimpatience of the youth, in the same breath.\n\n\"If there's one, there's thirty of the miscreants!\" he said, in a sort\nof episode to his whispered comments. \"Ay, ay; they are edging towards\nthe river--Peace, pup--peace--no, here they come this way again--the\nthieves don't seem to know their own errand! If there were just six of\nus, lad, what a beautiful ambushment we might make upon them, from this\nvery spot--it won't do, it won't do, boy; keep yourself closer, or your\nhead will be seen--besides, I'm not altogether strong in the opinion it\nwould be lawful, as they have done us no harm.--There they bend again to\nthe river--no; here they come up the swell--now is the moment to be as\nstill, as if the breath had done its duty and departed the body.\"\n\nThe old man sunk into the grass while he was speaking, as if the final\nseparation to which he alluded, had, in his own case, actually occurred,\nand, at the next instant, a band of wild horsemen whirled by them, with\nthe noiseless rapidity in which it might be imagined a troop of spectres\nwould pass. The dark and fleeting forms were already vanished, when the\ntrapper ventured again to raise his head to a level with the tops of\nthe bending herbage, motioning at the same time, to his companions to\nmaintain their positions and their silence.\n\n\"They are going down the swell, towards the encampment,\" he continued,\nin his former guarded tones; \"no, they halt in the bottom, and are\nclustering together like deer, in council. By the Lord, they are turning\nagain, and we are not yet done with the reptiles!\"\n\nOnce more he sought his friendly cover, and at the next instant the dark\ntroop were to be seen riding, in a disorderly manner, on the very summit\nof the little elevation on which the trapper and his companions lay. It\nwas now soon apparent that they had returned to avail themselves of the\nheight of the ground, in order to examine the dim horizon.\n\nSome dismounted, while others rode to and fro, like men engaged in a\nlocal enquiry of much interest. Happily, for the hidden party, the grass\nin which they were concealed, not only served to skreen them from the\neyes of the savages, but opposed an obstacle to prevent their horses,\nwhich were no less rude and untrained than their riders, from trampling\non them, in their irregular and wild paces.\n\nAt length an athletic and dark looking Indian, who, by his air of\nauthority, would seem to be the leader, summoned his chiefs about him,\nto a consultation, which was held mounted. This body was collected on\nthe very margin of that mass of herbage in which the trapper and his\ncompanions were hid. As the young man looked up and saw the fierce\naspect of the group, which was increasing at each instant by the\naccession of some countenance and figure, apparently more forbidding\nthan any which had preceded it, he drew his rifle, by a very natural\nimpulse, from beneath him, and commenced putting it in a state for\nservice. The female, at his side, buried her face in the grass, by a\nfeeling that was, possibly, quite as natural to her sex and habits,\nleaving him to follow the impulses of his hot blood; but his aged and\nmore prudent adviser, whispered, sternly, in his ear--\n\n\"The tick of the lock is as well known to the knaves, as the blast of a\ntrumpet to a soldier! lay down the piece--lay down the piece--should the\nmoon touch the barrel, it could not fail to be seen by the devils, whose\neyes are keener than the blackest snake's! The smallest motion, now,\nwould be sure to bring an arrow among us.\"\n\nThe bee-hunter so far obeyed as to continue immovable and silent. But\nthere was still sufficient light to convince his companion, by the\ncontracted brow and threatening eye of the young man, that a discovery\nwould not bestow a bloodless victory on the savages. Finding his advice\ndisregarded, the trapper took his measures accordingly, and awaited the\nresult with a resignation and calmness that were characteristic of the\nindividual.\n\nIn the mean time, the Siouxes (for the sagacity of the old man was not\ndeceived in the character of his dangerous neighbours) had terminated\ntheir council, and were again dispersed along the ridge of land as if\nthey sought some hidden object.\n\n\"The imps have heard the hound!\" whispered the trapper, \"and their ears\nare too true to be cheated in the distance. Keep close, lad, keep close;\ndown with your head to the very earth, like a dog that sleeps.\"\n\n\"Let us rather take to our feet, and trust to manhood,\" returned his\nimpatient companion.\n\nHe would have proceeded; but feeling a hand laid rudely on his shoulder,\nhe turned his eyes upward, and beheld the dark and savage countenance of\nan Indian gleaming full upon him. Notwithstanding the surprise and the\ndisadvantage of his attitude, the youth was not disposed to become a\ncaptive so easily. Quicker than the flash of his own gun he sprang upon\nhis feet, and was throttling his opponent with a power that would soon\nhave terminated the contest, when he felt the arms of the trapper\nthrown round his body, confining his exertions by a strength very little\ninferior to his own. Before he had time to reproach his comrade for\nthis apparent treachery, a dozen Siouxes were around them, and the whole\nparty were compelled to yield themselves as prisoners.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n           --With much more dismay,\n           I view the fight, than those that make the fray.\n                                           --Merchant of Venice.\n\nThe unfortunate bee-hunter and his companions had become the captives of\na people, who might, without exaggeration, be called the Ishmaelites of\nthe American deserts. From time immemorial, the hands of the Siouxes had\nbeen turned against their neighbours of the prairies, and even at this\nday, when the influence and authority of a civilised government are\nbeginning to be felt around them, they are considered a treacherous and\ndangerous race. At the period of our tale, the case was far worse; few\nwhite men trusting themselves in the remote and unprotected regions\nwhere so false a tribe was known to dwell.\n\nNotwithstanding the peaceable submission of the trapper, he was quite\naware of the character of the band into whose hands he had fallen.\nIt would have been difficult, however, for the nicest judge to have\ndetermined whether fear, policy, or resignation formed the secret motive\nof the old man, in permitting himself to be plundered as he did, without\na murmur. So far from opposing any remonstrance to the rude and violent\nmanner in which his conquerors performed the customary office, he even\nanticipated their cupidity, by tendering to the chiefs such articles\nas he thought might prove the most acceptable. On the other hand Paul\nHover, who had been literally a conquered man, manifested the strongest\nrepugnance to submit to the violent liberties that were taken with\nhis person and property. He even gave several exceedingly unequivocal\ndemonstrations of his displeasure during the summary process, and would,\nmore than once, have broken out in open and desperate resistance, but\nfor the admonitions and entreaties of the trembling girl, who clung to\nhis side, in a manner so dependent, as to show the youth, that her hopes\nwere now placed, no less on his discretion, than on his disposition to\nserve her.\n\nThe Indians had, however, no sooner deprived the captives of their arms\nand ammunition, and stripped them of a few articles of dress of little\nuse, and perhaps of less value, than they appeared disposed to grant\nthem a respite. Business of greater moment pressed on their hands,\nand required their attention. Another consultation of the chiefs was\nconvened, and it was apparent, by the earnest and vehement manner of the\nfew who spoke, that the warriors conceived their success as yet to be\nfar from complete.\n\n\"It will be well,\" whispered the trapper, who knew enough of the\nlanguage he heard to comprehend perfectly the subject of the discussion,\n\"if the travellers who lie near the willow brake are not awoke out of\ntheir sleep by a visit from these miscreants. They are too cunning to\nbelieve that a woman of the 'pale-faces' is to be found so far from the\nsettlements, without having a white man's inventions and comforts at\nhand.\"\n\n\"If they will carry the tribe of wandering Ishmael to the Rocky\nMountains,\" said the young bee-hunter, laughing in his vexation with a\nsort of bitter merriment, \"I may forgive the rascals.\"\n\n\"Paul! Paul!\" exclaimed his companion in a tone of reproach, \"you forget\nall! Think of the dreadful consequences!\"\n\n\"Ay, it was thinking of what you call consequences, Ellen, that\nprevented me from putting the matter, at once, to yonder red-devil, and\nmaking it a real knock-down and drag-out! Old trapper, the sin of this\ncowardly business lies on your shoulders! But it is no more than your\ndaily calling, I reckon, to take men, as well as beasts, in snares.\"\n\n\"I implore you, Paul, to be calm--to be patient.\"\n\n\"Well, since it is your wish, Ellen,\" returned the youth, endeavouring\nto swallow his spleen, \"I will make the trial; though, as you ought\nto know, it is part of the religion of a Kentuckian to fret himself a\nlittle at a mischance.\"\n\n\"I fear your friends in the other bottom will not escape the eyes of\nthe imps!\" continued the trapper, as coolly as though he had not heard a\nsyllable of the intervening discourse. \"They scent plunder; and it would\nbe as hard to drive a hound from his game, as to throw the varmints from\nits trail.\"\n\n\"Is there nothing to be done?\" asked Ellen, in an imploring manner,\nwhich proved the sincerity of her concern.\n\n\"It would be an easy matter to call out, in so loud a voice as to make\nold Ishmael dream that the wolves were among his flock,\" Paul replied;\n\"I can make myself heard a mile in these open fields, and his camp is\nbut a short quarter from us.\"\n\n\"And get knocked on the head for your pains,\" returned the trapper.\n\"No, no; cunning must match cunning, or the hounds will murder the whole\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Murder! no--no murder. Ishmael loves travel so well, there would be no\nharm in his having a look at the other sea, but the old fellow is in a\nbad condition to take the long journey! I would try a lock myself before\nhe should be quite murdered.\"\n\n\"His party is strong in number, and well armed; do you think it will\nfight?\"\n\n\"Look here, old trapper: few men love Ishmael Bush and his seven\nsledge-hammer sons less than one Paul Hover; but I scorn to slander even\na Tennessee shotgun. There is as much of the true stand-up courage among\nthem, as there is in any family that was ever raised in Kentuck, itself.\nThey are a long-sided and a double-jointed breed; and let me tell you,\nthat he who takes the measure of one of them on the ground, must be a\nworkman at a hug.\"\n\n\"Hist! The savages have done their talk, and are about to set their\naccursed devices in motion. Let us be patient; something may yet offer\nin favour of your friends.\"\n\n\"Friends! call none of the race a friend of mine, trapper, if you have\nthe smallest regard for my affection! What I say in their favour is less\nfrom love than honesty.\"\n\n\"I did not know but the young woman was of the kin,\" returned the\nother, a little drily--\"but no offence should be taken, where none was\nintended.\"\n\nThe mouth of Paul was again stopped by the hand of Ellen, who took on\nherself to reply, in her conciliating tones: \"we should be all of a\nfamily, when it is in our power to serve each other. We depend entirely\non your experience, honest old man, to discover the means to apprise our\nfriends of their danger.\"\n\n\"There will be a real time of it,\" muttered the bee-hunter, laughing,\n\"if the boys get at work, in good earnest, with these red skins!\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a general movement which took place among the\nband. The Indians dismounted to a man, giving their horses in charge\nto three or four of the party, who were also intrusted with the safe\nkeeping of the prisoners. They then formed themselves in a circle around\na warrior, who appeared to possess the chief authority; and at a given\nsignal the whole array moved slowly and cautiously from the centre in\nstraight and consequently in diverging lines. Most of their dark forms\nwere soon blended with the brown covering of the prairie; though the\ncaptives, who watched the slightest movement of their enemies with\nvigilant eyes, were now and then enabled to discern a human figure,\ndrawn against the horizon, as some one, more eager than the rest, rose\nto his greatest height in order to extend the limits of his view. But\nit was not long before even these fugitive glimpses of the moving, and\nconstantly increasing circle, were lost, and uncertainty and conjecture\nwere added to apprehension. In this manner passed many anxious and weary\nminutes, during the close of which the listeners expected at each moment\nto hear the whoop of the assailants and the shrieks of the assailed,\nrising together on the stillness of the night. But it would seem, that\nthe search which was so evidently making, was without a sufficient\nobject; for at the expiration of half an hour the different individuals\nof the band began to return singly, gloomy and sullen, like men who were\ndisappointed.\n\n\"Our time is at hand,\" observed the trapper, who noted the smallest\nincident, or the slightest indication of hostility among the savages:\n\"we are now to be questioned; and if I know any thing of the policy of\nour case, I should say it would be wise to choose one among us to hold\nthe discourse, in order that our testimony may agree. And furthermore,\nif an opinion from one as old and as worthless as a hunter of fourscore,\nis to be regarded, I would just venture to say, that man should be the\none most skilled in the natur' of an Indian, and that he should also\nknow something of their language.--Are you acquainted with the tongue of\nthe Siouxes, friend?\"\n\n\"Swarm your own hive,\" returned the discontented bee-hunter. \"You are\ngood at buzzing, old trapper, if you are good at nothing else.\"\n\n\"'Tis the gift of youth to be rash and heady,\" the trapper calmly\nretorted. \"The day has been, boy, when my blood was like your own, too\nswift and too hot to run quietly in my veins. But what will it profit to\ntalk of silly risks and foolish acts at this time of life! A grey head\nshould cover a brain of reason, and not the tongue of a boaster.\"\n\n\"True, true,\" whispered Ellen; \"and we have other things to attend to\nnow! Here comes the Indian to put his questions.\"\n\nThe girl, whose apprehensions had quickened her senses, was not\ndeceived. She was yet speaking when a tall, half naked savage,\napproached the spot where they stood, and after examining the whole\nparty as closely as the dim light permitted, for more than a minute\nin perfect stillness, he gave the usual salutation in the harsh and\nguttural tones of his own language. The trapper replied as well as he\ncould, which it seems was sufficiently well to be understood. In order\nto escape the imputation of pedantry we shall render the substance, and,\nso far as it is possible, the form of the dialogue that succeeded, into\nthe English tongue.\n\n\"Have the pale-faces eaten their own buffaloes, and taken the skins from\nall their own beavers,\" continued the savage, allowing the usual moment\nof decorum to elapse, after the words of greeting, before he again\nspoke, \"that they come to count how many are left among the Pawnees?\"\n\n\"Some of us are here to buy, and some to sell,\" returned the trapper;\n\"but none will follow, if they hear it is not safe to come nigh the\nlodge of a Sioux.\"\n\n\"The Siouxes are thieves, and they live among the snow; why do we talk\nof a people who are so far, when we are in the country of the Pawnees?\"\n\n\"If the Pawnees are the owners of this land, then white and red are here\nby equal right.\"\n\n\"Have not the pale-faces stolen enough from the red men, that you come\nso far to carry a lie? I have said that this is a hunting-ground of my\ntribe.\"\n\n\"My right to be here is equal to your own,\" the trapper rejoined, with\nundisturbed coolness; \"I do not speak as I might--it is better to be\nsilent. The Pawnees and the white men are brothers, but a Sioux dare not\nshow his face in the village of the Loups.\"\n\n\"The Dahcotahs are men!\" exclaimed the savage, fiercely; forgetting\nin his anger to maintain the character he had assumed, and using the\nappellation of which his nation was most proud; \"the Dahcotahs have\nno fear! Speak; what brings you so far from the villages of the\npale-faces?\"\n\n\"I have seen the sun rise and set on many councils, and have heard\nthe words of wise men. Let your chiefs come, and my mouth shall not be\nshut.\"\n\n\"I am a great chief!\" said the savage, affecting an air of offended\ndignity. \"Do you take me for an Assiniboine? Weucha is a warrior often\nnamed, and much believed!\"\n\n\"Am I a fool not to know a burnt-wood Teton?\" demanded the trapper, with\na steadiness that did great credit to his nerves. \"Go; it is dark, and\nyou do not see that my head is grey!\"\n\nThe Indian now appeared convinced that he had adopted too shallow an\nartifice to deceive one so practised as the man he addressed, and he was\ndeliberating what fiction he should next invent, in order to obtain his\nreal object, when a slight commotion among the band put an end at once\nto all his schemes. Casting his eyes behind him, as if fearful of a\nspeedy interruption, he said, in tones much less pretending than those\nhe had first resorted to--\n\n\"Give Weucha the milk of the Long-knives, and he will sing your name in\nthe ears of the great men of his tribe.\"\n\n\"Go,\" repeated the trapper, motioning him away, with strong disgust.\n\"Your young men are speaking of Mahtoree. My words are for the ears of a\nchief.\"\n\nThe savage cast a look at the other, which, notwithstanding the dim\nlight, was sufficiently indicative of implacable hostility. He then\nstole away among his fellows, anxious to conceal the counterfeit he had\nattempted to practise, no less than the treachery he had contemplated\nagainst a fair division of the spoils, from the man named by the\ntrapper, whom he now also knew to be approaching, by the manner in\nwhich his name passed from one to another, in the band. He had hardly\ndisappeared before a warrior of powerful frame advanced out of the dark\ncircle, and placed himself before the captives, with that high and proud\nbearing for which a distinguished Indian chief is ever so remarkable.\nHe was followed by all the party, who arranged themselves around his\nperson, in a deep and respectful silence.\n\n\"The earth is very large,\" the chief commenced, after a pause of that\ntrue dignity which his counterfeit had so miserably affected; \"why can\nthe children of my great white father never find room on it?\"\n\n\"Some among them have heard that their friends in the prairies are in\nwant of many things,\" returned the trapper; \"and they have come to see\nif it be true. Some want, in their turns, what the red men are willing\nto sell, and they come to make their friends rich, with powder and\nblankets.\"\n\n\"Do traders cross the big river with empty hands?\"\n\n\"Our hands are empty because your young men thought we were tired, and\nthey have lightened us of our load. They were mistaken; I am old, but I\nam still strong.\"\n\n\"It cannot be. Your load has fallen in the prairies. Show my young men\nthe place, that they may pick it up before the Pawnees find it.\"\n\n\"The path to the spot is crooked, and it is night. The hour is come for\nsleep,\" said the trapper, with perfect composure. \"Bid your warriors go\nover yonder hill; there is water and there is wood; let them light their\nfires and sleep with warm feet. When the sun comes again I will speak to\nyou.\"\n\nA low murmur, but one that was clearly indicative of dissatisfaction,\npassed among the attentive listeners, and served to inform the old man\nthat he had not been sufficiently wary in proposing a measure that he\nintended should notify the travellers in the brake of the presence of\ntheir dangerous neighbours. Mahtoree, however, without betraying, in the\nslightest degree, the excitement which was so strongly exhibited by his\ncompanions, continued the discourse in the same lofty manner as before.\n\n\"I know that my friend is rich,\" he said; \"that he has many warriors\nnot far off, and that horses are plentier with him, than dogs among the\nred-skins.\"\n\n\"You see my warriors, and my horses.\"\n\n\"What! has the woman the feet of a Dahcotah, that she can walk for\nthirty nights in the prairies, and not fall! I know the red men of the\nwoods make long marches on foot, but we, who live where the eye cannot\nsee from one lodge to another, love our horses.\"\n\nThe trapper now hesitated, in his turn. He was perfectly aware that\ndeception, if detected, might prove dangerous; and, for one of his\npursuits and character, he was strongly troubled with an unaccommodating\nregard for the truth. But, recollecting that he controlled the fate of\nothers as well as of himself, he determined to let things take their\ncourse, and to permit the Dahcotah chief to deceive himself if he would.\n\n\"The women of the Siouxes and of the white men are not of the same\nwigwam,\" he answered evasively. \"Would a Teton warrior make his wife\ngreater than himself? I know he would not; and yet my ears have heard\nthat there are lands where the councils are held by squaws.\"\n\nAnother slight movement in the dark circle apprised the trapper that\nhis declaration was not received without surprise, if entirely without\ndistrust. The chief alone seemed unmoved; nor was he disposed to relax\nfrom the loftiness and high dignity of his air.\n\n\"My white fathers who live on the great lakes have declared,\" he said,\n\"that their brothers towards the rising sun are not men; and now I know\nthey did not lie! Go--what is a nation whose chief is a squaw! Are you\nthe dog and not the husband of this woman?\"\n\n\"I am neither. Never did I see her face before this day. She came into\nthe prairies because they had told her a great and generous nation\ncalled the Dahcotahs lived there, and she wished to look on men. The\nwomen of the pale-faces, like the women of the Siouxes, open their eyes\nto see things that are new; but she is poor, like myself, and she will\nwant corn and buffaloes, if you take away the little that she and her\nfriend still have.\"\n\n\"My ears listen to many wicked lies!\" exclaimed the Teton warrior, in\na voice so stern that it startled even his red auditors. \"Am I a woman?\nHas not a Dahcotah eyes? Tell me, white hunter; who are the men of your\ncolour, that sleep near the fallen trees?\"\n\nAs he spoke, the indignant chief pointed in the direction of Ishmael's\nencampment, leaving the trapper no reason to doubt, that the superior\nindustry and sagacity of this man had effected a discovery, which had\neluded the search of the rest of his party. Notwithstanding his regret\nat an event that might prove fatal to the sleepers, and some little\nvexation at having been so completely outwitted, in the dialogue\njust related, the old man continued to maintain his air of inflexible\ncomposure.\n\n\"It may be true,\" he answered, \"that white men are sleeping in the\nprairie. If my brother says it, it is true; but what men thus trust\nto the generosity of the Tetons, I cannot tell. If there be strangers\nasleep, send your young men to wake them up, and let them say why they\nare here; every pale-face has a tongue.\" The chief shook his head with\na wild and fierce smile, answering abruptly, as he turned away to put an\nend to the conference--\n\n\"The Dahcotahs are a wise race, and Mahtoree is their chief! He will not\ncall to the strangers, that they may rise and speak to him with their\ncarabines. He will whisper softly in their ears. When this is done, let\nthe men of their own colour come and awake them!\"\n\nAs he uttered these words, and turned on his heel, a low and approving\nlaugh passed around the dark circle, which instantly broke its order and\nfollowed him to a little distance from the stand of the captives, where\nthose who might presume to mingle opinions with so great a warrior again\ngathered about him in consultation. Weucha profited by the occasion to\nrenew his importunities; but the trapper, who had discovered how great\na counterfeit he was, shook him off in displeasure. An end was, however,\nmore effectually put to the annoyance of this malignant savage, by a\nmandate for the whole party, including men and beasts, to change their\npositions. The movement was made in dead silence, and with an order that\nwould have done credit to more enlightened beings. A halt, however, was\nsoon made; and when the captives had time to look about them, they found\nthey were in view of the low, dark outline of the copse, near which lay\nthe slumbering party of Ishmael.\n\nHere another short but grave and deliberative consultation was held.\n\nThe beasts, which seemed trained to such covert and silent attacks, were\nonce more placed under the care of keepers, who, as before, were charged\nwith the duty of watching the prisoners. The mind of the trapper was\nin no degree relieved from the uneasiness which was, at each instant,\ngetting a stronger possession of him, when he found Weucha was placed\nnearest to his own person, and, as it appeared by the air of triumph\nand authority he assumed, at the head of the guard also. The savage,\nhowever, who doubtless had his secret instructions, was content, for\nthe present, with making a significant gesture with his tomahawk, which\nmenaced death to Ellen. After admonishing in this expressive manner\nhis male captives of the fate that would instantly attend their female\ncompanion, on the slightest alarm proceeding from any of the party, he\nwas content to maintain a rigid silence. This unexpected forbearance, on\nthe part of Weucha, enabled the trapper and his two associates to\ngive their undivided attention to the little that might be seen of the\ninteresting movements which were passing in their front.\n\nMahtoree took the entire disposition of the arrangements on himself. He\npointed out the precise situation he wished each individual to occupy,\nlike one intimately acquainted with the qualifications of his respective\nfollowers, and he was obeyed with the deference and promptitude with\nwhich an Indian warrior is wont to submit to the instructions of his\nchief, in moments of trial. Some he despatched to the right, and\nothers to the left. Each man departed with the noiseless and quick step\npeculiar to the race, until all had assumed their allotted stations,\nwith the exception of two chosen warriors, who remained nigh the person\nof their leader. When the rest had disappeared, Mahtoree turned to these\nselect companions, and intimated by a sign that the critical moment had\narrived, when the enterprise he contemplated was to be put in execution.\n\nEach man laid aside the light fowling-piece, which, under the name of\na carabine, he carried in virtue of his rank; and divesting himself of\nevery article of exterior or heavy clothing, he stood resembling a dark\nand fierce looking statue, in the attitude, and nearly in the garb, of\nnature. Mahtoree assured himself of the right position of his tomahawk,\nfelt that his knife was secure in its sheath of skin, tightened his\ngirdle of wampum and saw that the lacing of his fringed and ornamental\nleggings was secure, and likely to offer no impediment to his exertions.\nThus prepared at all points, and ready for his desperate undertaking,\nthe Teton gave the signal to proceed.\n\nThe three advanced in a line with the encampment of the travellers,\nuntil, in the dim light by which they were seen, their dusky forms were\nnearly lost to the eyes of the prisoners. Here they paused, looking\naround them like men who deliberate and ponder long on the consequences\nbefore they take a desperate leap. Then sinking together, they became\nlost in the grass of the prairie.\n\nIt is not difficult to imagine the distress and anxiety of the different\nspectators of these threatening movements. Whatever might be the reasons\nof Ellen for entertaining no strong attachment to the family in which\nshe has first been seen by the reader, the feelings of her sex, and,\nperhaps, some lingering seeds of kindness, predominated. More than once\nshe felt tempted to brave the awful and instant danger that awaited such\nan offence, and to raise her feeble, and, in truth, impotent voice in\nwarning. So strong, indeed, and so very natural was the inclination,\nthat she would most probably have put it in execution, but for the often\nrepeated though whispered remonstrances of Paul Hover. In the breast of\nthe young bee-hunter himself, there was a singular union of emotions.\nHis first and chiefest solicitude was certainly in behalf of his gentle\nand dependent companion; but the sense of her danger was mingled, in\nthe breast of the reckless woodsman, with a consciousness of a high and\nwild, and by no means an unpleasant, excitement. Though united to the\nemigrants by ties still less binding than those of Ellen, he longed\nto hear the crack of their rifles, and, had occasion offered, he would\ngladly have been among the first to rush to their rescue. There were,\nin truth, moments when he felt in his turn an impulse, that was nearly\nresistless, to spring forward and awake the unconscious sleepers; but\na glance at Ellen would serve to recall his tottering prudence, and to\nadmonish him of the consequences. The trapper alone remained calm and\nobservant, as if nothing that involved his personal comfort or safety\nhad occurred. His ever-moving, vigilant eyes, watched the smallest\nchange, with the composure of one too long inured to scenes of danger\nto be easily moved, and with an expression of cool determination\nwhich denoted the intention he actually harboured, of profiting by the\nsmallest oversight on the part of the captors.\n\nIn the mean time the Teton warriors had not been idle. Profiting by the\nhigh fog which grew in the bottoms, they had wormed their way through\nthe matted grass, like so many treacherous serpents stealing on their\nprey, until the point was gained, where an extraordinary caution became\nnecessary to their further advance. Mahtoree, alone, had occasionally\nelevated his dark, grim countenance above the herbage, straining his\neye-balls to penetrate the gloom which skirted the border of the brake.\nIn these momentary glances he gained sufficient knowledge, added to that\nhe had obtained in his former search, to be the perfect master of\nthe position of his intended victims, though he was still profoundly\nignorant of their numbers, and of their means of defence.\n\nHis efforts to possess himself of the requisite knowledge concerning\nthese two latter and essential points were, however, completely baffled\nby the stillness of the camp, which lay in a quiet as deep as if it\nwere literally a place of the dead. Too wary and distrustful to rely, in\ncircumstances of so much doubt, on the discretion of any less firm and\ncrafty than himself, the Dahcotah bade his companions remain where they\nlay, and pursued the adventure alone.\n\nThe progress of Mahtoree was now slow, and to one less accustomed to\nsuch a species of exercise, it would have proved painfully laborious.\nBut the advance of the wily snake itself is not more certain or\nnoiseless than was his approach. He drew his form, foot by foot, through\nthe bending grass, pausing at each movement to catch the smallest sound\nthat might betray any knowledge, on the part of the travellers, of\nhis proximity. He succeeded, at length, in dragging himself out of the\nsickly light of the moon, into the shadows of the brake, where not\nonly his own dark person was much less liable to be seen, but where\nthe surrounding objects became more distinctly visible to his keen and\nactive glances.\n\nHere the Teton paused long and warily to make his observations, before\nhe ventured further. His position enabled him to bring the whole\nencampment, with its tent, wagons, and lodges, into a dark but clearly\nmarked profile; furnishing a clue by which the practised warrior was led\nto a tolerably accurate estimate of the force he was about to encounter.\nStill an unnatural silence pervaded the spot, as if men suppressed even\nthe quiet breathings of sleep, in order to render the appearance of\ntheir confidence more evident. The chief bent his head to the earth, and\nlistened intently. He was about to raise it again, in disappointment,\nwhen the long drawn and trembling respiration of one who slumbered\nimperfectly met his ear. The Indian was too well skilled in all the\nmeans of deception to become himself the victim of any common artifice.\nHe knew the sound to be natural, by its peculiar quivering, and he\nhesitated no longer.\n\nA man of nerves less tried than those of the fierce and conquering\nMahtoree would have been keenly sensible of all the hazard he incurred.\nThe reputation of those hardy and powerful white adventurers, who so\noften penetrated the wilds inhabited by his people, was well known to\nhim; but while he drew nigher, with the respect and caution that a brave\nenemy never fails to inspire, it was with the vindictive animosity of a\nred man, jealous and resentful of the inroads of the stranger.\n\nTurning from the line of his former route, the Teton dragged himself\ndirectly towards the margin of the thicket. When this material object\nwas effected in safety, he arose to his seat, and took a better survey\nof his situation. A single moment served to apprise him of the place\nwhere the unsuspecting traveller lay. The reader will readily anticipate\nthat the savage had succeeded in gaining a dangerous proximity to one\nof those slothful sons of Ishmael, who were deputed to watch over the\nisolated encampment of the travellers.\n\nWhen certain that he was undiscovered, the Dahcotah raised his person\nagain, and bending forward, he moved his dark visage above the face of\nthe sleeper, in that sort of wanton and subtle manner with which the\nreptile is seen to play about its victim before it strikes. Satisfied at\nlength, not only of the condition but of the character of the stranger,\nMahtoree was in the act of withdrawing his head, when a slight movement\nof the sleeper announced the symptoms of reviving consciousness. The\nsavage seized the knife which hung at his girdle, and in an instant it\nwas poised above the breast of the young emigrant. Then changing his\npurpose, with an action as rapid as his own flashing thoughts, he\nsunk back behind the trunk of the fallen tree against which the other\nreclined, and lay in its shadow, as dark, as motionless, and apparently\nas insensible as the wood itself.\n\nThe slothful sentinel opened his heavy eyes, and gazing upward for\na moment at the hazy heavens, he made an extraordinary exertion, and\nraised his powerful frame from the support of the log. Then he looked\nabout him, with an air of something like watchfulness, suffering his\ndull glances to run over the misty objects of the encampment until\nthey finally settled on the distant and dim field of the open prairie.\nMeeting with nothing more attractive than the same faint outlines of\nswell and interval, which every where rose before his drowsy eyes, he\nchanged his position so as completely to turn his back on his dangerous\nneighbour, and suffered his person to sink sluggishly down into its\nformer recumbent attitude. A long, and, on the part of the Teton, an\nanxious and painful silence succeeded, before the deep breathing of the\ntraveller again announced that he was indulging in his slumbers. The\nsavage was, however, far too jealous of a counterfeit to trust to the\nfirst appearance of sleep. But the fatigues of a day of unusual toil lay\ntoo heavy on the sentinel to leave the other long in doubt. Still the\nmotion with which Mahtoree again raised himself to his knees was\nso noiseless and guarded, that even a vigilant observer might have\nhesitated to believe he stirred. The change was, however, at length\neffected, and the Dahcotah chief then bent again over his enemy, without\nhaving produced a noise louder than that of the cotton-wood leaf which\nfluttered at his side in the currents of the passing air.\n\nMahtoree now felt himself master of the sleeper's fate. At the same time\nthat he scanned the vast proportions and athletic limbs of the youth, in\nthat sort of admiration which physical excellence seldom fails to\nexcite in the breast of a savage, he coolly prepared to extinguish the\nprinciple of vitality which could alone render them formidable. After\nmaking himself sure of the seat of life, by gently removing the folds of\nthe intervening cloth, he raised his keen weapon, and was about to unite\nhis strength and skill in the impending blow, when the young man threw\nhis brawny arm carelessly backward, exhibiting in the action the vast\nvolume of its muscles.\n\nThe sagacious and wary Teton paused. It struck his acute faculties that\nsleep was less dangerous to him, at that moment, than even death itself\nmight prove. The smallest noise, the agony of struggling, with which\nsuch a frame would probably relinquish its hold of life, suggested\nthemselves to his rapid thoughts, and were all present to his\nexperienced senses. He looked back into the encampment, turned his head\ninto the thicket, and glanced his glowing eyes abroad into the wild and\nsilent prairies. Bending once more over the respited victim, he assured\nhimself that he was sleeping heavily, and then abandoned his immediate\npurpose in obedience alone to the suggestions of a more crafty policy.\n\nThe retreat of Mahtoree was as still and guarded as had been his\napproach. He now took the direction of the encampment, stealing along\nthe margin of the brake, as a cover into which he might easily plunge at\nthe smallest alarm. The drapery of the solitary hut attracted his notice\nin passing. After examining the whole of its exterior, and listening\nwith painful intensity, in order to gather counsel from his ears, the\nsavage ventured to raise the cloth at the bottom, and to thrust his dark\nvisage beneath. It might have been a minute before the Teton chief drew\nback, and seated himself with the whole of his form without the linen\ntenement. Here he sat, seemingly brooding over his discovery, for many\nmoments, in rigid inaction. Then he resumed his crouching attitude,\nand once more projected his visage beyond the covering of the tent. His\nsecond visit to the interior was longer, and, if possible, more ominous\nthan the first. But it had, like every thing else, its termination,\nand the savage again withdrew his glaring eyes from the secrets of the\nplace.\n\nMahtoree had drawn his person many yards from the spot, in his slow\nprogress towards the cluster of objects which pointed out the centre of\nthe position, before he again stopped. He made another pause, and looked\nback at the solitary little dwelling he had left, as if doubtful whether\nhe should not return. But the chevaux-de-frise of branches now lay\nwithin reach of his arm, and the very appearance of precaution it\npresented, as it announced the value of the effects it encircled,\ntempted his cupidity, and induced him to proceed.\n\nThe passage of the savage, through the tender and brittle limbs of the\ncotton-wood, could be likened only to the sinuous and noiseless winding\nof the reptiles which he imitated. When he had effected his object,\nand had taken an instant to become acquainted with the nature of the\nlocalities within the enclosure, the Teton used the precaution to open a\nway through which he might make a swift retreat. Then raising himself\non his feet, he stalked through the encampment, like the master of evil,\nseeking whom and what he should first devote to his fell purposes.\nHe had already ascertained the contents of the lodge in which were\ncollected the woman and her young children, and had passed several\ngigantic frames, stretched on different piles of brush, which happily\nfor him lay in unconscious helplessness, when he reached the spot\noccupied by Ishmael in person. It could not escape the sagacity of one\nlike Mahtoree, that he had now within his power the principal man among\nthe travellers. He stood long hovering above the recumbent and Herculean\nform of the emigrant, keenly debating in his own mind the chances of his\nenterprise, and the most effectual means of reaping its richest harvest.\n\nHe sheathed the knife, which, under the hasty and burning impulse of his\nthoughts, he had been tempted to draw, and was passing on, when Ishmael\nturned in his lair, and demanded roughly who was moving before his\nhalf-opened eyes. Nothing short of the readiness and cunning of a savage\ncould have evaded the crisis. Imitating the gruff tones and nearly\nunintelligible sounds he heard, Mahtoree threw his body heavily on\nthe earth, and appeared to dispose himself to sleep. Though the whole\nmovement was seen by Ishmael, in a sort of stupid observation, the\nartifice was too bold and too admirably executed to fail. The drowsy\nfather closed his eyes, and slept heavily, with this treacherous inmate\nin the very bosom of his family.\n\nIt was necessary for the Teton to maintain the position he had taken,\nfor many long and weary minutes, in order to make sure that he was no\nlonger watched. Though his body lay so motionless, his active mind was\nnot idle. He profited by the delay to mature a plan which he intended\nshould put the whole encampment, including both its effects and their\nproprietors, entirely at his mercy. The instant he could do so with\nsafety, the indefatigable savage was again in motion. He took his way\ntowards the slight pen which contained the domestic animals, worming\nhimself along the ground in his former subtle and guarded manner.\n\nThe first animal he encountered among the beasts occasioned a long and\nhazardous delay. The weary creature, perhaps conscious, through its\nsecret instinct, that in the endless wastes of the prairies its surest\nprotector was to be found in man, was so exceedingly docile as quietly\nto submit to the close examination it was doomed to undergo. The hand\nof the wandering Teton passed over the downy coat, the meek countenance,\nand the slender limbs of the gentle creature, with untiring curiosity;\nbut he finally abandoned the prize, as useless in his predatory\nexpeditions, and offering too little temptation to the appetite. As\nsoon, however, as he found himself among the beasts of burden, his\ngratification was extreme, and it was with difficulty that he restrained\nthe customary ejaculations of pleasure that were more than once on the\npoint of bursting from his lips. Here he lost sight of the hazards\nby which he had gained access to his dangerous position; and the\nwatchfulness of the wary and long practised warrior was momentarily\nforgotten in the exultation of the savage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n            Why, worthy father, what have we to lose?\n                    --The law\n            Protects us not. Then why should we be tender\n            To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us!\n            Play judge and executioner.\n                                                    --Cymbeline.\n\nWhile the Teton thus enacted his subtle and characteristic part, not a\nsound broke the stillness of the surrounding prairie. The whole band\nlay at their several posts, waiting, with the well-known patience of the\nnatives, for the signal which was to summon them to action. To the eyes\nof the anxious spectators who occupied the little eminence, already\ndescribed as the position of the captives, the scene presented the\nbroad, solemn view of a waste, dimly lighted by the glimmering rays of\na clouded moon. The place of the encampment was marked by a gloom deeper\nthan that which faintly shadowed out the courses of the bottoms, and\nhere and there a brighter streak tinged the rolling summits of the\nridges. As for the rest, it was the deep, imposing quiet of a desert.\n\nBut to those who so well knew how much was brooding beneath this mantle\nof stillness and night, it was a scene of high and wild excitement.\nTheir anxiety gradually increased, as minute after minute passed away,\nand not the smallest sound of life arose out of the calm and darkness\nwhich enveloped the brake. The breathing of Paul grew louder and deeper,\nand more than once Ellen trembled at she knew not what, as she felt the\nquivering of his active frame, while she leaned dependently on his arm\nfor support.\n\nThe shallow honesty, as well as the besetting infirmity of Weucha, have\nalready been exhibited. The reader, therefore, will not be surprised\nto learn that he was the first to forget the regulations he had himself\nimposed. It was at the precise moment when we left Mahtoree yielding to\nhis nearly ungovernable delight, as he surveyed the number and quality\nof Ishmael's beasts of burden, that the man he had selected to watch his\ncaptives chose to indulge in the malignant pleasure of tormenting\nthose it was his duty to protect. Bending his head nigh the ear of the\ntrapper, the savage rather muttered than whispered--\n\n\"If the Tetons lose their great chief by the hands of the\nLong-knives[*], old shall die as well as young!\"\n\n    [*] The whites are so called by the Indians, from their swords.\n\n\"Life is the gift of the Wahcondah,\" was the unmoved reply. \"The\nburnt-wood warrior must submit to his laws, as well as his other\nchildren. Men only die when he chooses; and no Dahcotah can change the\nhour.\"\n\n\"Look!\" returned the savage, thrusting the blade of his knife before the\nface of his captive. \"Weucha is the Wahcondah of a dog.\"\n\nThe old man raised his eyes to the fierce visage of his keeper, and, for\na moment, a gleam of honest and powerful disgust shot from their deep\ncells; but it instantly passed away, leaving in its place an expression\nof commiseration, if not of sorrow.\n\n\"Why should one made in the real image of God suffer his natur' to be\nprovoked by a mere effigy of reason?\" he said in English, and in\ntones much louder than those in which Weucha had chosen to pitch the\nconversation. The latter profited by the unintentional offence of\nhis captive, and, seizing him by the thin, grey locks, that fell from\nbeneath his cap, was on the point of passing the blade of his knife in\nmalignant triumph around their roots, when a long, shrill yell rent\nthe air, and was instantly echoed from the surrounding waste, as if a\nthousand demons opened their throats in common at the summons. Weucha\nrelinquished his grasp, and uttered a cry of exultation.\n\n\"Now!\" shouted Paul, unable to control his impatience any longer, \"now,\nold Ishmael, is the time to show the native blood of Kentucky! Fire low,\nboys--level into the swales, for the red skins are settling to the very\nearth!\"\n\nHis voice was, however, lost, or rather unheeded, in the midst of the\nshrieks, shouts, and yells that were, by this time, bursting from fifty\nmouths on every side of him. The guards still maintained their posts at\nthe side of the captives, but it was with that sort of difficulty with\nwhich steeds are restrained at the starting-post, when expecting the\nsignal to commence the trial of speed. They tossed their arms wildly in\nthe air, leaping up and down more like exulting children than sober men,\nand continued to utter the most frantic cries.\n\nIn the midst of this tumultuous disorder a rushing sound was heard,\nsimilar to that which might be expected to precede the passage of a\nflight of buffaloes, and then came the flocks and cattle of Ishmael in\none confused and frightened drove.\n\n\"They have robbed the squatter of his beasts!\" said the attentive\ntrapper. \"The reptiles have left him as hoofless as a beaver!\" He was\nyet speaking, when the whole body of the terrified animals rose the\nlittle acclivity, and swept by the place where he stood, followed by a\nband of dusky and demon-like looking figures, who pressed madly on their\nrear.\n\nThe impulse was communicated to the Teton horses, long accustomed to\nsympathise in the untutored passions of their owners, and it was with\ndifficulty that the keepers were enabled to restrain their impatience.\nAt this moment, when all eyes were directed to the passing whirlwind\nof men and beasts, the trapper caught the knife from the hands of his\ninattentive keeper, with a power that his age would have seemed to\ncontradict, and, at a single blow, severed the thong of hide which\nconnected the whole of the drove. The wild animals snorted with joy and\nterror, and tearing the earth with their heels, they dashed away into\nthe broad prairies, in a dozen different directions.\n\nWeucha turned upon his assailant with the ferocity and agility of a\ntiger. He felt for the weapon of which he had been so suddenly deprived,\nfumbled with impotent haste for the handle of his tomahawk, and at the\nsame moment glanced his eyes after the flying cattle, with the longings\nof a Western Indian. The struggle between thirst for vengeance and\ncupidity was severe but short. The latter quickly predominated in the\nbosom of one whose passions were proverbially grovelling; and scarcely\na moment intervened between the flight of the animals and the swift\npursuit of the guards. The trapper had continued calmly facing his foe,\nduring the instant of suspense that succeeded his hardy act; and now\nthat Weucha was seen following his companions, he pointed after the dark\ntrain, saying, with his deep and nearly inaudible laugh--\n\n\"Red-natur' is red-natur', let it show itself on a prairie, or in a\nforest! A knock on the head would be the smallest reward to him who\nshould take such a liberty with a Christian sentinel; but there goes the\nTeton after his horses as if he thought two legs as good as four in such\na race! And yet the imps will have every hoof of them afore the day sets\nin, because it's reason ag'in instinct. Poor reason, I allow; but still\nthere is a great deal of the man in an Indian. Ah's me! your Delawares\nwere the redskins of which America might boast; but few and scattered\nis that mighty people, now! Well! the traveller may just make his pitch\nwhere he is; he has plenty of water, though natur' has cheated him of\nthe pleasure of stripping the 'arth of its lawful trees. He has seen the\nlast of his four-footed creatures, or I am but little skilled in Sioux\ncunning.\"\n\n\"Had we not better join the party of Ishmael?\" said the bee-hunter.\n\"There will be a regular fight about this matter, or the old fellow has\nsuddenly grown chicken-hearted.\"\n\n\"No--no--no,\" hastily exclaimed Ellen.\n\nShe was stopped by the trapper, who laid his hand gently on her mouth,\nas he answered--\n\n\"Hist--hist!--the sound of voices might bring us into danger. Is your\nfriend,\" he added, turning to Paul, \"a man of spirit enough?\"\n\n\"Don't call the squatter a friend of mine!\" interrupted the youth. \"I\nnever yet harboured with one who could not show hand and zeal for the\nland which fed him.\"\n\n\"Well--well. Let it then be acquaintance. Is he a man to maintain his\nown, stoutly by dint of powder and lead?\"\n\n\"His own! ay, and that which is not his own, too! Can you tell me, old\ntrapper, who held the rifle that did the deed for the sheriff's deputy,\nthat thought to rout the unlawful settlers who had gathered nigh the\nBuffaloe lick in old Kentucky? I had lined a beautiful swarm that very\nday into the hollow of a dead beech, and there lay the people's officer\nat its roots, with a hole directly through the 'grace of God;' which he\ncarried in his jacket pocket covering his heart, as if he thought a bit\nof sheepskin was a breastplate against a squatter's bullet! Now, Ellen,\nyou needn't be troubled for it never strictly was brought home to him;\nand there were fifty others who had pitched in that neighbourhood with\njust the same authority from the law.\"\n\nThe poor girl shuddered, struggling powerfully to suppress the sigh\nwhich arose in spite of her efforts, as if from the very bottom of her\nheart.\n\nThoroughly satisfied that he understood the character of the emigrants,\nby the short but comprehensive description conveyed in Paul's reply, the\nold man raised no further question concerning the readiness of Ishmael\nto revenge his wrongs, but rather followed the train of thought which\nwas suggested to his experience, by the occasion.\n\n\"Each one knows the ties which bind him to his fellow-creatures best,\"\nhe answered. \"Though it is greatly to be mourned that colour, and\nproperty, and tongue, and l'arning should make so wide a difference in\nthose who, after all, are but the children of one father! Howsomever,\"\nhe continued, by a transition not a little characteristic of the\npursuits and feelings of the man, \"as this is a business in which there\nis much more likelihood of a fight than need for a sermon, it is best to\nbe prepared for what may follow.--Hush! there is a movement below; it is\nan equal chance that we are seen.\"\n\n\"The family is stirring,\" cried Ellen, with a tremor that announced\nnearly as much terror at the approach of her friends, as she had before\nmanifested at the presence of her enemies. \"Go, Paul, leave me. You, at\nleast, must not be seen!\"\n\n\"If I leave you, Ellen, in this desert before I see you safe in the care\nof old Ishmael, at least, may I never hear the hum of another bee, or,\nwhat is worse, fail in sight to line him to his hive!\"\n\n\"You forget this good old man. He will not leave me. Though I am sure,\nPaul, we have parted before, where there has been more of a desert than\nthis.\"\n\n\"Never! These Indians may come whooping back, and then where are you!\nHalf way to the Rocky Mountains before a man can fairly strike the line\nof your flight. What think you, old trapper? How long may it be before\nthese Tetons, as you call them, will be coming for the rest of old\nIshmael's goods and chattels?\"\n\n\"No fear of them,\" returned the old man, laughing in his own peculiar\nand silent manner; \"I warrant me the devils will be scampering after\ntheir beasts these six hours yet! Listen! you may hear them in the\nwillow bottoms at this very moment; ay, your real Sioux cattle will run\nlike so many long-legged elks. Hist! crouch again into the grass, down\nwith ye both; as I'm a miserable piece of clay, I heard the ticking of a\ngunlock!\"\n\nThe trapper did not allow his companions time to hesitate, but dragging\nthem both after him, he nearly buried his own person in the fog of the\nprairie, while he was speaking. It was fortunate that the senses of\nthe aged hunter remained so acute, and that he had lost none of his\nreadiness of action. The three were scarcely bowed to the ground, when\ntheir ears were saluted with the well-known, sharp, short, reports of\nthe western rifle, and instantly, the whizzing of the ragged lead was\nheard, buzzing within dangerous proximity of their heads.\n\n\"Well done, young chips! well done, old block!\" whispered Paul, whose\nspirits no danger nor situation could entirely depress. \"As pretty a\nvolley, as one would wish to bear on the wrong end of a rifle! What d'ye\nsay, trapper! here is likely to be a three-cornered war. Shall I give\n'em as good as they send?\"\n\n\"Give them nothing but fair words,\" returned the other, hastily, \"or you\nare both lost.\"\n\n\"I'm not certain it would much mend the matter, if I were to speak with\nmy tongue instead of the piece,\" said Paul, in a tone half jocular half\nbitter.\n\n\"For the sake of heaven, do not let them hear you!\" cried Ellen. \"Go,\nPaul, go; you can easily quit us now!\"\n\nSeveral shots in quick succession, each sending its dangerous messenger,\nstill nearer than the preceding discharge, cut short her speech, no less\nin prudence than in terror.\n\n\"This must end,\" said the trapper, rising with the dignity of one bent\nonly on the importance of his object. \"I know not what need ye may have,\nchildren, to fear those you should both love and honour, but something\nmust be done to save your lives. A few hours more or less can never\nbe missed from the time of one who has already numbered so many days;\ntherefore I will advance. Here is a clear space around you. Profit by it\nas you need, and may God bless and prosper each of you, as ye deserve!\"\n\nWithout waiting for any reply, the trapper walked boldly down the\ndeclivity in his front, taking the direction of the encampment, neither\nquickening his pace in trepidation, nor suffering it to be retarded\nby fear. The light of the moon fell brighter for a moment on his\ntall, gaunt, form, and served to warn the emigrants of his approach.\nIndifferent, however to this unfavourable circumstance, he held his way,\nsilently and steadily towards the copse, until a threatening voice met\nhim with a challenge of--\n\n\"Who comes; friend or foe?\"\n\n\"Friend,\" was the reply; \"one who has lived too long to disturb the\nclose of life with quarrels.\"\n\n\"But not so long as to forget the tricks of his youth,\" said Ishmael,\nrearing his huge frame from beneath the slight covering of a low bush,\nand meeting the trapper, face to face; \"old man, you have brought this\ntribe of red devils upon us, and to-morrow you will be sharing the\nbooty.\"\n\n\"What have you lost?\" calmly demanded the trapper.\n\n\"Eight as good mares as ever travelled in gears, besides a foal that is\nworth thirty of the brightest Mexicans that bear the face of the King of\nSpain. Then the woman has not a cloven hoof for her dairy, or her loom,\nand I believe even the grunters, foot sore as they be, are ploughing the\nprairie. And now, stranger,\" he added, dropping the butt of his rifle on\nthe hard earth, with a violence and clatter that would have intimidated\none less firm than the man he addressed, \"how many of these creatures\nmay fall to your lot?\"\n\n\"Horses have I never craved, nor even used; though few have journeyed\nover more of the wide lands of America than myself, old and feeble as I\nseem. But little use is there for a horse among the hills and woods of\nYork--that is, as York was, but as I greatly fear York is no longer--as\nfor woollen covering and cow's milk, I covet no such womanly fashions!\nThe beasts of the field give me food and raiment. No, I crave no cloth\nbetter than the skin of a deer, nor any meat richer than his flesh.\"\n\nThe sincere manner of the trapper, as he uttered this simple\nvindication, was not entirely thrown away on the emigrant, whose dull\nnature was gradually quickening into a flame, that might speedily have\nburst forth with dangerous violence. He listened like one who\ndoubted, not entirely convinced: and he muttered between his teeth the\ndenunciation, with which a moment before he intended to precede the\nsummary vengeance he had certainly meditated.\n\n\"This is brave talking,\" he at length grumbled; \"but to my judgment,\ntoo lawyer-like, for a straight forward, fair-weather, and foul-weather\nhunter.\"\n\n\"I claim to be no better than a trapper,\" the other meekly answered.\n\n\"Hunter or trapper--there is little difference. I have come, old man,\ninto these districts because I found the law sitting too tight upon me,\nand am not over fond of neighbours who can't settle a dispute without\ntroubling a justice and twelve men; but I didn't come to be robb'd of my\nplunder, and then to say thank'ee to the man who did it!\"\n\n\"He, who ventures far into the prairies, must abide by the ways of its\nowners.\"\n\n\"Owners!\" echoed the squatter, \"I am as rightful an owner of the land\nI stand on, as any governor in the States! Can you tell me, stranger,\nwhere the law or the reason, is to be found, which says that one man\nshall have a section, or a town, or perhaps a county to his use, and\nanother have to beg for earth to make his grave in? This is not nature,\nand I deny that it is law. That is, your legal law.\"\n\n\"I cannot say that you are wrong,\" returned the trapper, whose opinions\non this important topic, though drawn from very different premises, were\nin singular accordance with those of his companion, \"and I have often\nthought and said as much, when and where I have believed my voice could\nbe heard. But your beasts are stolen by them who claim to be masters of\nall they find in the deserts.\"\n\n\"They had better not dispute that matter with a man who knows better,\"\nsaid the other in a portentous voice, though it seemed deep and sluggish\nas he who spoke.\n\n\"I call myself a fair trader, and one who gives to his chaps as good as\nhe receives. You saw the Indians?\"\n\n\"I did--they held me a prisoner, while they stole into your camp.\"\n\n\"It would have been more like a white man and a Christian, to have let\nme known as much in better season,\" retorted Ishmael, casting another\nominous sidelong glance at the trapper, as if still meditating evil. \"I\nam not much given to call every man, I fall in with, cousin, but colour\nshould be something, when Christians meet in such a place as this. But\nwhat is done, is done, and cannot be mended, by words. Come out of your\nambush, boys; here is no one but the old man: he has eaten of my bread,\nand should be our friend; though there is such good reason to suspect\nhim of harbouring with our enemies.\"\n\nThe trapper made no reply to the harsh suspicion which the other did\nnot scruple to utter without the smallest delicacy, notwithstanding the\nexplanations and denials to which he had just listened. The summons of\nthe unnurtured squatter brought an immediate accession to their party.\nFour or five of his sons made their appearance from beneath as many\ncovers, where they had been posted under the impression that the figures\nthey had seen, on the swell of the prairie, were a part of the Sioux\nband. As each man approached, and dropped his rifle into the hollow\nof his arm, he cast an indolent but enquiring glance at the stranger,\nthough neither of them expressed the least curiosity to know whence he\nhad come or why he was there. This forbearance, however, proceeded only\nin part, from the sluggishness of their common temper; for long and\nfrequent experience in scenes of a similar character, had taught them\nthe virtue of discretion. The trapper endured their sullen scrutiny with\nthe steadiness of one as practised as themselves, and with the entire\ncomposure of innocence. Content with the momentary examination he had\nmade, the eldest of the group, who was in truth the delinquent sentinel\nby whose remissness the wily Mahtoree had so well profited, turned\ntowards his father and said bluntly--\n\n\"If this man is all that is left of the party I saw on the upland,\nyonder, we haven't altogether thrown away our ammunition.\"\n\n\"Asa, you are right,\" said the father, turning suddenly on the trapper,\na lost idea being recalled by the hint of his son. \"How is it, stranger;\nthere were three of you, just now, or there is no virtue in moonlight?\"\n\n\"If you had seen the Tetons racing across the prairies, like so many\nblack-looking evil ones, on the heels of your cattle, my friend, it\nwould have been an easy matter to have fancied them a thousand.\"\n\n\"Ay, for a town bred boy, or a skeary woman; though for that matter,\nthere is old Esther; she has no more fear of a red-skin than of a\nsuckling cub, or of a wolf pup. I'll warrant ye, had your thievish\ndevils made their push by the light of the sun, the good woman would\nhave been smartly at work among them, and the Siouxes would have found\nshe was not given to part with her cheese and her butter without a\nprice. But there'll come a time, stranger, right soon, when justice will\nhave its dues, and that too, without the help of what is called the law.\nWe ar' of a slow breed, it may be said, and it is often said, of us; but\nslow is sure; and there ar' few men living, who can say they ever struck\na blow, that they did not get one as hard in return, from Ishmael Bush.\"\n\n\"Then has Ishmael Bush followed the instinct of the beasts rather than\nthe principle which ought to belong to his kind,\" returned the stubborn\ntrapper. \"I have struck many a blow myself, but never have I felt the\nsame ease of mind that of right belongs to a man who follows his reason,\nafter slaying even a fawn when there was no call for his meat or hide,\nas I have felt at leaving a Mingo unburied in the woods, when following\nthe trade of open and honest warfare.\"\n\n\"What, you have been a soldier, have you, trapper! I made a forage or\ntwo among the Cherokees, when I was a lad myself; and I followed mad\nAnthony,[*] one season, through the beeches; but there was altogether\ntoo much tatooing and regulating among his troops for me; so I left him\nwithout calling on the paymaster to settle my arrearages. Though, as\nEsther afterwards boasted, she had made such use of the pay-ticket, that\nthe States gained no great sum, by the oversight. You have heard of such\na man as mad Anthony, if you tarried long among the soldiers.\"\n\n    [*] Anthony Wayne, a Pennsylvanian distinguished in the war of the\n    revolution, and subsequently against the Indians of the west, for\n    his daring as a general, by which he gained from his followers the\n    title of Mad Anthony. General Wayne was the son of the person\n    mentioned in the life of West as commanding the regiment which\n    excited his military ardour.\n\n\"I fou't my last battle, as I hope, under his orders,\" returned the\ntrapper, a gleam of sunshine shooting from his dim eyes, as if the\nevent was recollected with pleasure, and then a sudden shade of sorrow\nsucceeding, as though he felt a secret admonition against dwelling\non the violent scenes in which he had so often been an actor. \"I was\npassing from the States on the sea-shore into these far regions, when\nI cross'd the trail of his army, and I fell in, on his rear, just as a\nlooker-on; but when they got to blows, the crack of my rifle was heard\namong the rest, though to my shame it may be said, I never knew the\nright of the quarrel as well as a man of threescore and ten should know\nthe reason of his acts afore he takes mortal life, which is a gift he\nnever can return!\"\n\n\"Come, stranger,\" said the emigrant, his rugged nature a good deal\nsoftened when he found that they had fought on the same side in the\nwild warfare of the west, \"it is of small account, what may be the\nground-work of the disturbance, when it's a Christian ag'in a savage. We\nshall hear more of this horse-stealing to-morrow; to-night we can do no\nwiser or safer thing than to sleep.\"\n\nSo saying, Ishmael deliberately led the way back towards his rifled\nencampment, and ushered the man, whose life a few minutes before had\nbeen in real jeopardy from his resentment, into the presence of his\nfamily. Here, with a very few words of explanation, mingled with scarce\nbut ominous denunciations against the plunderers, he made his wife\nacquainted with the state of things on the prairie, and announced his\nown determination to compensate himself for his broken rest, by devoting\nthe remainder of the night to sleep.\n\nThe trapper gave his ready assent to the measure, and adjusted his gaunt\nform on the pile of brush that was offered him, with as much composure\nas a sovereign could resign himself to sleep, in the security of his\ncapital and surrounded by his armed protectors. The old man did not\nclose his eyes, however, until he had assured himself that Ellen Wade\nwas among the females of the family, and that her relation, or lover,\nwhichever he might be, had observed the caution of keeping himself out\nof view: after which he slept, though with the peculiar watchfulness of\none long accustomed to vigilance, even in the hours of deepest night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n         He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd,\n         As it were too peregrinate, as I may call it.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nThe Anglo-American is apt to boast, and not without reason, that his\nnation may claim a descent more truly honourable than that of any other\npeople whose history is to be credited. Whatever might have been the\nweaknesses of the original colonists, their virtues have rarely been\ndisputed. If they were superstitious, they were sincerely pious, and,\nconsequently, honest. The descendants of these simple and single-minded\nprovincials have been content to reject the ordinary and artificial\nmeans by which honours have been perpetuated in families, and have\nsubstituted a standard which brings the individual himself to the ordeal\nof the public estimation, paying as little deference as may be to those\nwho have gone before him. This forbearance, self-denial, or common\nsense, or by whatever term it may be thought proper to distinguish the\nmeasure, has subjected the nation to the imputation of having an ignoble\norigin. Were it worth the enquiry, it would be found that more than a\njust proportion of the renowned names of the mother-country are, at this\nhour, to be found in her ci-devant colonies; and it is a fact well known\nto the few who have wasted sufficient time to become the masters of so\nunimportant a subject, that the direct descendants of many a failing\nline, which the policy of England has seen fit to sustain by collateral\nsupporters, are now discharging the simple duties of citizens in the\nbosom of this republic. The hive has remained stationary, and they\nwho flutter around the venerable straw are wont to claim the empty\ndistinction of antiquity, regardless alike of the frailty of their\ntenement and of the enjoyments of the numerous and vigorous swarms\nthat are culling the fresher sweets of a virgin world. But as this is a\nsubject which belongs rather to the politician and historian than to\nthe humble narrator of the homebred incidents we are about to reveal,\nwe must confine our reflections to such matters as have an immediate\nrelation to the subject of the tale.\n\nAlthough the citizen of the United States may claim so just an ancestry,\nhe is far from being exempt from the penalties of his fallen race. Like\ncauses are well known to produce like effects. That tribute, which it\nwould seem nations must ever pay, by way of a weary probation, around\nthe shrine of Ceres, before they can be indulged in her fullest favours,\nis in some measure exacted in America, from the descendant instead of\nthe ancestor. The march of civilisation with us, has a strong analogy\nto that of all coming events, which are known \"to cast their shadows\nbefore.\" The gradations of society, from that state which is called\nrefined to that which approaches as near barbarity as connection with an\nintelligent people will readily allow, are to be traced from the bosom\nof the States, where wealth, luxury and the arts are beginning to seat\nthemselves, to those distant, and ever-receding borders which mark\nthe skirts, and announce the approach, of the nation, as moving mists\nprecede the signs of day.\n\nHere, and here only, is to be found that widely spread, though far from\nnumerous class, which may be at all likened to those who have paved\nthe way for the intellectual progress of nations, in the old world. The\nresemblance between the American borderer and his European prototype\nis singular, though not always uniform. Both might be called without\nrestraint; the one being above, the other beyond the reach of the\nlaw--brave, because they were inured to dangers--proud, because they\nwere independent, and vindictive, because each was the avenger of his\nown wrongs. It would be unjust to the borderer to pursue the parallel\nmuch farther. He is irreligious, because he has inherited the knowledge\nthat religion does not exist in forms, and his reason rejects mockery.\nHe is not a knight, because he has not the power to bestow distinctions;\nand he has not the power, because he is the offspring and not the parent\nof a system. In what manner these several qualities are exhibited, in\nsome of the most strongly marked of the latter class, will be seen in\nthe course of the ensuing narrative.\n\nIshmael Bush had passed the whole of a life of more than fifty years on\nthe skirts of society. He boasted that he had never dwelt where he might\nnot safely fell every tree he could view from his own threshold; that\nthe law had rarely been known to enter his clearing, and that his ears\nhad never willingly admitted the sound of a church bell. His exertions\nseldom exceeded his wants, which were peculiar to his class, and rarely\nfailed of being supplied. He had no respect for any learning except that\nof the leech; because he was ignorant of the application of any\nother intelligence than such as met the senses. His deference to\nthis particular branch of science had induced him to listen to the\napplication of a medical man, whose thirst for natural history had led\nhim to the desire of profiting by the migratory propensities of the\nsquatter. This gentleman he had cordially received into his family, or\nrather under his protection, and they had journeyed together, thus far\nthrough the prairies, in perfect harmony: Ishmael often felicitating his\nwife on the possession of a companion, who would be so serviceable in\ntheir new abode, wherever it might chance to be, until the family were\nthoroughly \"acclimated.\" The pursuits of the naturalist frequently led\nhim, however, for days at a time, from the direct line of the route of\nthe squatter, who rarely seemed to have any other guide than the sun.\nMost men would have deemed themselves fortunate to have been absent on\nthe perilous occasion of the Sioux inroad, as was Obed Bat, (or as he\nwas fond of hearing himself called, Battius,) M.D. and fellow of several\ncis-Atlantic learned societies--the adventurous gentleman in question.\n\nAlthough the sluggish nature of Ishmael was not actually awakened, it\nwas sorely pricked by the liberties which had just been taken with his\nproperty. He slept, however, for it was the hour he had allotted to that\nrefreshment, and because he knew how impotent any exertions to recover\nhis effects must prove in the darkness of midnight. He also knew the\ndanger of his present situation too well to hazard what was left in\npursuit of that which was lost. Much as the inhabitants of the prairies\nwere known to love horses, their attachment to many other articles,\nstill in the possession of the travellers, was equally well understood.\nIt was a common artifice to scatter the herds, and to profit by the\nconfusion. But Mahtoree had, as it would seem in this particular\nundervalued the acuteness of the man he had assailed. The phlegm with\nwhich the squatter learned his loss, has already been seen, and it now\nremains to exhibit the results of his more matured determinations.\n\nThough the encampment contained many an eye that was long unclosed, and\nmany an ear that listened greedily to catch the faintest evidence of\nany new alarm, it lay in deep quiet during the remainder of the night.\nSilence and fatigue finally performed their accustomed offices, and\nbefore the morning all but the sentinels were again buried in sleep. How\nwell these indolent watchers discharged their duties, after the assault,\nhas never been known, inasmuch as nothing occurred to confirm or to\ndisprove their subsequent vigilance.\n\nJust as day, however, began to dawn, and a grey light was falling from\nthe heavens, on the dusky objects of the plain, the half startled,\nanxious, and yet blooming countenance of Ellen Wade was reared above the\nconfused mass of children, among whom she had clustered on her stolen\nreturn to the camp. Arising warily she stepped lightly across the\nrecumbent bodies, and proceeded with the same caution to the utmost\nlimits of the defences of Ishmael. Here she listened, as if she doubted\nthe propriety of venturing further. The pause was only momentary,\nhowever; and long before the drowsy eyes of the sentinel, who overlooked\nthe spot where she stood, had time to catch a glimpse of her active\nform, it had glided along the bottom, and stood on the summit of the\nnearest eminence.\n\nEllen now listened intently anxious to catch some other sound, than the\nbreathing of the morning air, which faintly rustled the herbage at her\nfeet. She was about to turn in disappointment from the enquiry, when the\ntread of human feet making their way through the matted grass met her\near. Springing eagerly forward, she soon beheld the outlines of a figure\nadvancing up the eminence, on the side opposite to the camp. She had\nalready uttered the name of Paul, and was beginning to speak in the\nhurried and eager voice with which female affection is apt to greet a\nfriend, when, drawing back, the disappointed girl closed her salutation\nby coldly adding--\"I did not expect, Doctor, to meet you at this unusual\nhour.\"\n\n\"All hours and all seasons are alike, my good Ellen, to the genuine\nlover of nature,\"--returned a small, slightly made, but exceedingly\nactive man, dressed in an odd mixture of cloth and skins, a little\npast the middle age, and who advanced directly to her side, with the\nfamiliarity of an old acquaintance; \"and he who does not know how to\nfind things to admire by this grey light, is ignorant of a large portion\nof the blessings he enjoys.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said Ellen, suddenly recollecting the necessity of\naccounting for her own appearance abroad at that unseasonable hour; \"I\nknow many who think the earth has a pleasanter look in the night, than\nwhen seen by the brightest sunshine.\"\n\n\"Ah! Their organs of sight must be too convex! But the man who wishes\nto study the active habits of the feline race, or the variety, albinos,\nmust, indeed, be stirring at this hour. I dare say, there are men who\nprefer even looking at objects by twilight, for the simple reason, that\nthey see better at that time of the day.\"\n\n\"And is this the cause why you are so much abroad in the night?\"\n\n\"I am abroad at night, my good girl, because the earth in its diurnal\nrevolutions leaves the light of the sun but half the time on any given\nmeridian, and because what I have to do cannot be performed in twelve or\nfifteen consecutive hours. Now have I been off two days from the family,\nin search of a plant, that is known to exist on the tributaries of\nLa Platte, without seeing even a blade of grass that is not already\nenumerated and classed.\"\n\n\"You have been unfortunate, Doctor, but--\"\n\n\"Unfortunate!\" echoed the little man, sideling nigher to his companion,\nand producing his tablets with an air in which exultation struggled,\nstrangely, with an affectation of self-abasement. \"No, no, Ellen, I am\nany thing but unfortunate. Unless, indeed, a man may be so called, whose\nfortune is made, whose fame may be said to be established for ever,\nwhose name will go down to posterity with that of Buffon--Buffon! a mere\ncompiler: one who flourishes on the foundation of other men's labours.\nNo; pari passu with Solander, who bought his knowledge with pain and\nprivations!\"\n\n\"Have you discovered a mine, Doctor Bat?\"\n\n\"More than a mine; a treasure coined, and fit for instant use,\ngirl.--Listen! I was making the angle necessary to intersect the line of\nyour uncle's march, after my fruitless search, when I heard sounds like\nthe explosion produced by fire arms--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed Ellen, eagerly, \"we had an alarm--\"\n\n\"And thought I was lost,\" continued the man of science too much bent on\nhis own ideas, to understand her interruption. \"Little danger of that!\nI made my own base, knew the length of the perpendicular by calculation,\nand to draw the hypothenuse had nothing to do but to work my angle. I\nsupposed the guns were fired for my benefit, and changed my course\nfor the sounds--not that I think the sense more accurate, or even as\naccurate as a mathematical calculation, but I feared that some of the\nchildren might need my services.\"\n\n\"They are all happily--\"\n\n\"Listen,\" interrupted the other, already forgetting his affected anxiety\nfor his patients, in the greater importance of the present subject. \"I\nhad crossed a large tract of prairie--for sound is conveyed far where\nthere is little obstruction--when I heard the trampling of feet, as if\nbisons were beating the earth. Then I caught a distant view of a herd\nof quadrupeds, rushing up and down the swells--animals, which would\nhave still remained unknown and undescribed, had it not been for a most\nfelicitous accident! One, and he a noble specimen of the whole! was\nrunning a little apart from the rest. The herd made an inclination in my\ndirection, in which the solitary animal coincided, and this brought\nhim within fifty yards of the spot where I stood. I profited by the\nopportunity, and by the aid of steel and taper, I wrote his description\non the spot. I would have given a thousand dollars, Ellen, for a single\nshot from the rifle of one of the boys!\"\n\n\"You carry a pistol, Doctor, why didn't you use it?\" said the half\ninattentive girl, anxiously examining the prairie, but still lingering\nwhere she stood, quite willing to be detained.\n\n\"Ay, but it carries nothing but the most minute particles of lead,\nadapted to the destruction of the larger insects and reptiles. No, I did\nbetter than to attempt waging a war, in which I could not be the\nvictor. I recorded the event; noting each particular with the precision\nnecessary to science. You shall hear, Ellen; for you are a good and\nimproving girl, and by retaining what you learn in this way, may yet be\nof great service to learning, should any accident occur to me. Indeed,\nmy worthy Ellen, mine is a pursuit, which has its dangers as well as\nthat of the warrior. This very night,\" he continued, glancing his eye\nbehind him, \"this awful night, has the principle of life, itself, been\nin great danger of extinction!\"\n\n\"By what?\"\n\n\"By the monster I have discovered. It approached me often, and ever as I\nreceded, it continued to advance. I believe nothing but the little\nlamp, I carried, was my protector. I kept it between us, whilst I wrote,\nmaking it serve the double purpose of luminary and shield. But you shall\nhear the character of the beast, and you may then judge of the risks we\npromoters of science run in behalf of mankind.\"\n\nThe naturalist raised his tablets to the heavens, and disposed himself\nto read as well as he could, by the dim light they yet shed upon the\nplain; premising with saying--\n\n\"Listen, girl, and you shall hear, with what a treasure it has been my\nhappy lot to enrich the pages of natural history!\"\n\n\"Is it then a creature of your forming?\" said Ellen, turning away from\nher fruitless examination, with a sudden lighting of her sprightly blue\neyes, that showed she knew how to play with the foible of her learned\ncompanion.\n\n\"Is the power to give life to inanimate matter the gift of man? I would\nit were! You should speedily see a Historia Naturalis Americana, that\nwould put the sneering imitators of the Frenchman, De Buffon, to shame!\nA great improvement might be made in the formation of all quadrupeds;\nespecially those in which velocity is a virtue. Two of the inferior\nlimbs should be on the principle of the lever; wheels, perhaps, as they\nare now formed; though I have not yet determined whether the improvement\nmight be better applied to the anterior or posterior members, inasmuch\nas I am yet to learn whether dragging or shoving requires the greatest\nmuscular exertion. A natural exudation of the animal might assist in\novercoming the friction, and a powerful momentum be obtained. But all\nthis is hopeless--at least for the present!\"--he added, raising his\ntablets again to the light, and reading aloud; \"Oct. 6, 1805. that's\nmerely the date, which I dare say you know better than I--mem.\nQuadruped; seen by star-light, and by the aid of a pocket-lamp, in\nthe prairies of North America--see Journal for Latitude and Meridian.\nGenus--unknown; therefore named after the discoverer, and from the\nhappy coincidence of being seen in the evening--Vespertilio Horribilis,\nAmericanus. Dimensions (by estimation)--Greatest length, eleven feet;\nheight, six feet; head, erect; nostrils, expansive; eyes, expressive\nand fierce; teeth, serrated and abundant; tail, horizontal, waving,\nand slightly feline; feet, large and hairy; talons, long, curvated,\ndangerous; ears, inconspicuous; horns, elongated, diverging, and\nformidable; colour, plumbeous-ashy, with fiery spots; voice, sonorous,\nmartial, and appalling; habits, gregarious, carnivorous, fierce, and\nfearless. There,\" exclaimed Obed, when he had ended this sententious but\ncomprehensive description, \"there is an animal, which will be likely to\ndispute with the lion his title to be called the king of the beasts!\"\n\n\"I know not the meaning of all you have said, Doctor Battius,\" returned\nthe quick-witted girl, who understood the weakness of the philosopher,\nand often indulged him with a title he loved so well to hear; \"but I\nshall think it dangerous to venture far from the camp, if such monsters\nare prowling over the prairies.\"\n\n\"You may well call it prowling,\" returned the naturalist, nestling still\ncloser to her side, and dropping his voice to such low and undignified\ntones of confidence, as conveyed a meaning still more pointed than\nhe had intended. \"I have never before experienced such a trial of the\nnervous system; there was a moment, I acknowledge, when the fortiter in\nre faltered before so terrible an enemy; but the love of natural science\nbore me up, and brought me off in triumph!\"\n\n\"You speak a language so different from that we use in Tennessee,\" said\nEllen, struggling to conceal her laughter, \"that I hardly know whether\nI understand your meaning. If I am right, you wish to say you were\nchicken-hearted.\"\n\n\"An absurd simile drawn from an ignorance of the formation of the biped.\nThe heart of a chicken has a just proportion to its other organs, and\nthe domestic fowl is, in a state of nature, a gallant bird. Ellen,\" he\nadded, with a countenance so solemn as to produce an impression on the\nattentive girl, \"I was pursued, hunted, and in a danger that I scorn to\ndwell on--what's that?\"\n\nEllen started; for the earnestness and simple sincerity of her\ncompanion's manner had produced a certain degree of credulity, even on\nher buoyant mind. Looking in the direction indicated by the Doctor,\nshe beheld, in fact, a beast coursing over the prairie, and making a\nstraight and rapid approach to the very spot they occupied. The day was\nnot yet sufficiently advanced to enable her to distinguish its form and\ncharacter, though enough was discernible to induce her to imagine it a\nfierce and savage animal.\n\n\"It comes! it comes!\" exclaimed the Doctor, fumbling, by a sort of\ninstinct, for his tablets, while he fairly tottered on his feet under\nthe powerful efforts he made to maintain his ground. \"Now, Ellen,\nhas fortune given me an opportunity to correct the errors made by\nstar-light,--hold,--ashy-plumbeous,--no ears,--horns, excessive.\" His\nvoice and hand were both arrested by a roar, or rather a shriek from the\nbeast, that was sufficiently terrific to appal even a stouter heart than\nthat of the naturalist. The cries of the animal passed over the prairie\nin strange cadences, and then succeeded a deep and solemn silence,\nthat was only broken by an uncontrolled fit of merriment from the more\nmusical voice of Ellen Wade. In the mean time the naturalist stood\nlike a statue of amazement, permitting a well-grown ass, against whose\napproach he no longer offered his boasted shield of light, to smell\nabout his person, without comment or hinderance.\n\n\"It is your own ass,\" cried Ellen, the instant she found breath for\nwords; \"your own patient, hard working, hack!\"\n\nThe Doctor rolled his eyes from the beast to the speaker, and from the\nspeaker to the beast; but gave no audible expression of his wonder.\n\n\"Do you refuse to know an animal that has laboured so long in your\nservice?\" continued the laughing girl. \"A beast, that I have heard you\nsay a thousand times, has served you well, and whom you loved like a\nbrother!\"\n\n\"Asinus Domesticus!\" ejaculated the Doctor, drawing his breath like one\nwho had been near suffocation. \"There is no doubt of the genus; and I\nwill always maintain that the animal is not of the species, equus.\nThis is undeniably Asinus himself, Ellen Wade; but this is not the\nVespertilio Horribilis of the prairies! Very different animals, I\ncan assure you, young woman, and differently characterized in every\nimportant particular. That, carnivorous,\" he continued, glancing his\neye at the open page of his tablets; \"this, granivorous; habits, fierce,\ndangerous; habits, patient, abstemious; ears, inconspicuous; ears,\nelongated; horns, diverging, &c., horns, none!\"\n\nHe was interrupted by another burst of merriment from Ellen, which\nserved, in some measure, to recall him to his recollection.\n\n\"The image of the Vespertilio was on the retina,\" the astounded enquirer\ninto the secrets of nature observed, in a manner that seemed a little\napologetic, \"and I was silly enough to mistake my own faithful beast for\nthe monster. Though even now I greatly marvel to see this animal running\nat large!\"\n\nEllen then proceeded to explain the history of the attack and its\nresults. She described, with an accuracy that might have raised\nsuspicions of her own movements in the mind of one less simple than her\nauditor, the manner in which the beasts burst out of the encampment,\nand the headlong speed with which they had dispersed themselves over\nthe open plain. Although she forebore to say as much in terms, she\nso managed as to present before the eyes of her listener the strong\nprobability of his having mistaken the frightened drove for savage\nbeasts, and then terminated her account by a lamentation for their loss,\nand some very natural remarks on the helpless condition in which it\nhad left the family. The naturalist listened in silent wonder, neither\ninterrupting her narrative nor suffering a single exclamation of\nsurprise to escape him. The keen-eyed girl, however, saw that as she\nproceeded, the important leaf was torn from the tablets, in a manner\nwhich showed that their owner had got rid of his delusion at the same\ninstant. From that moment the world has heard no more of the Vespertilio\nHorribilis Americanus, and the natural sciences have irretrievably lost\nan important link in that great animated chain which is said to connect\nearth and heaven, and in which man is thought to be so familiarly\ncomplicated with the monkey.\n\nWhen Dr. Bat was put in full possession of all the circumstances of the\ninroad, his concern immediately took a different direction. He had left\nsundry folios, and certain boxes well stored with botanical specimens\nand defunct animals, under the good keeping of Ishmael, and it\nimmediately struck his acute mind, that marauders as subtle as the\nSiouxes would never neglect the opportunity to despoil him of these\ntreasures. Nothing that Ellen could say to the contrary served to\nappease his apprehensions, and, consequently, they separated; he to\nrelieve his doubts and fears together, and she to glide, as swiftly and\nsilently as she had just before passed it, into the still and solitary\ntent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n               What! fifty of my followers, at a clap!\n                                                         --Lear.\n\nThe day had now fairly opened on the seemingly interminable waste of\nthe prairie. The entrance of Obed at such a moment into the camp,\naccompanied as it was by vociferous lamentations over his anticipated\nloss, did not fail to rouse the drowsy family of the squatter. Ishmael\nand his sons, together with the forbidding looking brother of his wife,\nwere all speedily afoot; and then, as the sun began to shed his light on\nthe place, they became gradually apprised of the extent of their loss.\n\nIshmael looked round upon the motionless and heavily loaded vehicles\nwith his teeth firmly compressed, cast a glance at the amazed and\nhelpless group of children, which clustered around their sullen but\ndesponding mother, and walked out upon the open land, as if he found the\nair of the encampment too confined. He was followed by several of the\nmen, who were attentive observers, watching the dark expression of his\neye as the index of their own future movements. The whole proceeded in\nprofound and moody silence to the summit of the nearest swell, whence\nthey could command an almost boundless view of the naked plains. Here\nnothing was visible but a solitary buffaloe, that gleaned a meagre\nsubsistence from the decaying herbage, at no great distance, and the\nass of the physician, who profited by his freedom to enjoy a meal richer\nthan common.\n\n\"Yonder is one of the creatures left by the villains to mock us,\" said\nIshmael, glancing his eye towards the latter, \"and that the meanest of\nthe stock. This is a hard country to make a crop in, boys; and yet food\nmust be found to fill many hungry mouths!\"\n\n\"The rifle is better than the hoe, in such a place as this,\" returned\nthe eldest of his sons, kicking the hard and thirsty soil on which he\nstood, with an air of contempt. \"It is good for such as they who make\ntheir dinner better on beggars' beans than on homminy. A crow would shed\ntears if obliged by its errand to fly across the district.\"\n\n\"What say you, trapper?\" returned the father, showing the slight\nimpression his powerful heel had made on the compact earth, and laughing\nwith frightful ferocity. \"Is this the quality of land a man would choose\nwho never troubles the county clerk with title deeds?\"\n\n\"There is richer soil in the bottoms,\" returned the old man calmly, \"and\nyou have passed millions of acres to get to this dreary spot, where he\nwho loves to till the 'arth might have received bushels in return for\npints, and that too at the cost of no very grievous labour. If you have\ncome in search of land, you have journeyed hundreds of miles too far, or\nas many leagues too little.\"\n\n\"There is then a better choice towards the other Ocean?\" demanded the\nsquatter, pointing in the direction of the Pacific.\n\n\"There is, and I have seen it all,\" was the answer of the other, who\ndropped his rifle to the earth, and stood leaning on its barrel, like\none who recalled the scenes he had witnessed with melancholy pleasure.\n\"I have seen the waters of the two seas! On one of them was I born, and\nraised to be a lad like yonder tumbling boy. America has grown, my\nmen, since the days of my youth, to be a country larger than I once\nhad thought the world itself to be. Near seventy years I dwelt in York,\nprovince and state together:--you've been in York, 'tis like?\"\n\n\"Not I--not I; I never visited the towns; but often have heard the place\nyou speak of named. 'Tis a wide clearing there, I reckon.\"\n\n\"Too wide! too wide! They scourge the very 'arth with their axes. Such\nhills and hunting-grounds as I have seen stripped of the gifts of the\nLord, without remorse or shame! I tarried till the mouths of my hounds\nwere deafened by the blows of the chopper, and then I came west in\nsearch of quiet. It was a grievous journey that I made; a grievous toil\nto pass through falling timber and to breathe the thick air of smoky\nclearings, week after week, as I did! 'Tis a far country too, that state\nof York from this!\"\n\n\"It lies ag'in the outer edge of old Kentuck, I reckon; though what the\ndistance may be I never knew.\"\n\n\"A gull would have to fan a thousand miles of air to find the eastern\nsea. And yet it is no mighty reach to hunt across, when shade and game\nare plenty! The time has been when I followed the deer in the mountains\nof the Delaware and Hudson, and took the beaver on the streams of the\nupper lakes in the same season, but my eye was quick and certain at that\nday, and my limbs were like the legs of a moose! The dam of Hector,\"\ndropping his look kindly to the aged hound that crouched at his feet,\n\"was then a pup, and apt to open on the game the moment she struck the\nscent. She gave me a deal of trouble, that slut, she did!\"\n\n\"Your hound is old, stranger, and a rap on the head would prove a mercy\nto the beast.\"\n\n\"The dog is like his master,\" returned the trapper, without appearing to\nheed the brutal advice the other gave, \"and will number his days, when\nhis work amongst the game is over, and not before. To my eye things\nseem ordered to meet each other in this creation. 'Tis not the swiftest\nrunning deer that always throws off the hounds, nor the biggest arm\nthat holds the truest rifle. Look around you, men; what will the Yankee\nChoppers say, when they have cut their path from the eastern to the\nwestern waters, and find that a hand, which can lay the 'arth bare at\na blow, has been here and swept the country, in very mockery of their\nwickedness. They will turn on their tracks like a fox that doubles, and\nthen the rank smell of their own footsteps will show them the madness of\ntheir waste. Howsomever, these are thoughts that are more likely to rise\nin him who has seen the folly of eighty seasons, than to teach wisdom to\nmen still bent on the pleasures of their kind! You have need, yet, of\na stirring time, if you think to escape the craft and hatred of the\nburnt-wood Indians. They claim to be the lawful owners of this country,\nand seldom leave a white more than the skin he boasts of, when once they\nget the power, as they always have the will, to do him harm.\"\n\n\"Old man,\" said Ishmael sternly, \"to which people do you belong? You\nhave the colour and speech of a Christian, while it seems that your\nheart is with the redskins.\"\n\n\"To me there is little difference in nations. The people I loved most\nare scattered as the sands of the dry river-beds fly before the fall\nhurricanes, and life is too short to make use and custom with strangers,\nas one can do with such as he has dwelt amongst for years. Still am I a\nman without the cross of Indian blood; and what is due from a warrior\nto his nation, is owing by me to the people of the States; though little\nneed have they, with their militia and their armed boats, of help from a\nsingle arm of fourscore.\"\n\n\"Since you own your kin, I may ask a simple question. Where are the\nSiouxes who have stolen my cattle?\"\n\n\"Where is the herd of buffaloes, which was chased by the panther across\nthis plain, no later than the morning of yesterday? It is as hard--\"\n\n\"Friend,\" said Dr. Battius, who had hitherto been an attentive listener,\nbut who now felt a sudden impulse to mingle in the discourse, \"I\nam grieved when I find a venator or hunter, of your experience and\nobservation, following the current of vulgar error. The animal you\ndescribe is in truth a species of the bos ferus, (or bos sylvestris, as\nhe has been happily called by the poets,) but, though of close affinity,\nit is altogether distinct from the common bubulus. Bison is the better\nword; and I would suggest the necessity of adopting it in future, when\nyou shall have occasion to allude to the species.\"\n\n\"Bison or buffaloe, it makes but little matter. The creatur' is the\nsame, call it by what name you will, and--\"\n\n\"Pardon me, venerable venator; as classification is the very soul of\nthe natural sciences, the animal or vegetable must, of necessity, be\ncharacterised by the peculiarities of its species, which is always\nindicated by the name--\"\n\n\"Friend,\" said the trapper, a little positively, \"would the tail of a\nbeaver make the worse dinner for calling it a mink; or could you eat of\nthe wolf, with relish, because some bookish man had given it the name of\nvenison?\"\n\nAs these questions were put with no little earnestness and some spirit,\nthere was every probability that a hot discussion would have succeeded\nbetween two men, of whom one was so purely practical and the other so\nmuch given to theory, had not Ishmael seen fit to terminate the dispute,\nby bringing into view a subject that was much more important to his own\nimmediate interests.\n\n\"Beavers' tails and minks' flesh may do to talk about before a maple\nfire and a quiet hearth,\" interrupted the squatter, without the smallest\ndeference to the interested feelings of the disputants; \"but something\nmore than foreign words, or words of any sort, is now needed. Tell me,\ntrapper, where are your Siouxes skulking?\"\n\n\"It would be as easy to tell you the colours of the hawk that is\nfloating beneath yonder white cloud! When a red-skin strikes his blow,\nhe is not apt to wait until he is paid for the evil deed in lead.\"\n\n\"Will the beggarly savages believe they have enough, when they find\nthemselves master of all the stock?\"\n\n\"Natur' is much the same, let it be covered by what skin it may. Do\nyou ever find your longings after riches less when you have made a good\ncrop, than before you were master of a kernel of corn? If you do, you\ndiffer from what the experience of a long life tells me is the common\ncravings of man.\"\n\n\"Speak plainly, old stranger,\" said the squatter, striking the butt of\nhis rifle heavily on the earth, his dull capacity finding no pleasure in\na discourse that was conducted in so obscure allusions; \"I have asked a\nsimple question, and one I know well that you can answer.\"\n\n\"You are right, you are right. I can answer, for I have too often seen\nthe disposition of my kind to mistake it, when evil is stirring. When\nthe Siouxes have gathered in the beasts, and have made sure that you are\nnot upon their heels, they will be back nibbling like hungry wolves to\ntake the bait they have left or it may be, they'll show the temper of\nthe great bears, that are found at the falls of the Long River, and\nstrike at once with the paw, without stopping to nose their prey.\"\n\n\"You have then seen the animals you mention!\" exclaimed Dr. Battius,\nwho had now been thrown out of the conversation quite as long as his\nimpatience could well brook, and who approached the subject with his\ntablets ready opened, as a book of reference. \"Can you tell me if what\nyou encountered was of the species, ursus horribilis--with the ears,\nrounded--front, arquated--eyes--destitute of the remarkable supplemental\nlid--with six incisores, one false, and four perfect molares--\"\n\n\"Trapper, go on, for we are engaged in reasonable discourse,\"\ninterrupted Ishmael; \"you believe we shall see more of the robbers.\"\n\n\"Nay--nay--I do not call them robbers, for it is the usage of their\npeople, and what may be called the prairie law.\"\n\n\"I have come five hundred miles to find a place where no man can ding\nthe words of the law in my ears,\" said Ishmael, fiercely, \"and I am\nnot in a humour to stand quietly at a bar, while a red-skin sits in\njudgment. I tell you, trapper, if another Sioux is seen prowling around\nmy camp, wherever it may be, he shall feel the contents of old Kentuck,\"\nslapping his rifle, in a manner that could not be easily misconstrued,\n\"though he wore the medal of Washington,[*] himself. I call the man a\nrobber who takes that which is not his own.\"\n\n    [*] The American government creates chiefs among the western tribes,\n    and decorates them with silver medals bearing the impression of\n    the different presidents. That of Washington is the most prized.\n\n\"The Teton, and the Pawnee, and the Konza, and men of a dozen other\ntribes, claim to own these naked fields.\"\n\n\"Natur' gives them the lie in their teeth. The air, the water, and the\nground, are free gifts to man, and no one has the power to portion them\nout in parcels. Man must drink, and breathe, and walk,--and therefore\neach has a right to his share of 'arth. Why do not the surveyors of the\nStates set their compasses and run their lines over our heads as well as\nbeneath our feet? Why do they not cover their shining sheep-skins with\nbig words, giving to the landholder, or perhaps he should be called\nair holder, so many rods of heaven, with the use of such a star for a\nboundary-mark, and such a cloud to turn a mill?\"\n\nAs the squatter uttered his wild conceit, he laughed from the very\nbottom of his chest, in scorn. The deriding but frightful merriment\npassed from the mouth of one of his ponderous sons to that of the other,\nuntil it had made the circuit of the whole family.\n\n\"Come, trapper,\" continued Ishmael, in a tone of better humour, like a\nman who feels that he has triumphed, \"neither of us, I reckon, has ever\nhad much to do with title-deeds, or county clerks, or blazed trees;\ntherefore we will not waste words on fooleries. You ar' a man that has\ntarried long in this clearing, and now I ask your opinion, face to face,\nwithout fear or favour, if you had the lead in my business, what would\nyou do?\"\n\nThe old man hesitated, and seemed to give the required advice with deep\nreluctance. As every eye, however, was fastened on him, and whichever\nway he turned his face, he encountered a look riveted on the lineaments\nof his own working countenance, he answered in a low, melancholy, tone--\n\n\"I have seen too much mortal blood poured out in empty quarrels, to\nwish ever to hear an angry rifle again. Ten weary years have I sojourned\nalone on these naked plains, waiting for my hour, and not a blow have I\nstruck ag'in an enemy more humanised than the grizzly bear.\"\n\n\"Ursus horribilis,\" muttered the Doctor.\n\nThe speaker paused at the sound of the other's voice, but perceiving it\nwas no more than a sort of mental ejaculation, he continued in the same\nstrain--\n\n\"More humanised than the grizzly hear, or the panther of the Rocky\nMountains; unless the beaver, which is a wise and knowing animal, may\nbe so reckoned. What would I advise? Even the female buffaloe will fight\nfor her young!\"\n\n\"It never then shall be said, that Ishmael Bush has less kindness for\nhis children than the bear for her cubs!\"\n\n\"And yet this is but a naked spot for a dozen men to make head in, ag'in\nfive hundred.\"\n\n\"Ay, it is so,\" returned the squatter, glancing his eye towards his\nhumble camp; \"but something might be done, with the wagons and the\ncotton-wood.\"\n\nThe trapper shook his head incredulously, and pointed across the rolling\nplain in the direction of the west, as he answered--\n\n\"A rifle would send a bullet from these hills into your very\nsleeping-cabins; nay, arrows from the thicket in your rear would keep\nyou all burrowed, like so many prairie dogs: it wouldn't do, it wouldn't\ndo. Three long miles from this spot is a place, where as I have often\nthought in passing across the desert, a stand might be made for days and\nweeks together, if there were hearts and hands ready to engage in the\nbloody work.\"\n\nAnother low, deriding laugh passed among the young men, announcing, in\na manner sufficiently intelligible, their readiness to undertake a task\neven more arduous. The squatter himself eagerly seized the hint which\nhad been so reluctantly extorted from the trapper, who by some singular\nprocess of reasoning had evidently persuaded himself that it was his\nduty to be strictly neutral. A few direct and pertinent enquiries served\nto obtain the little additional information that was necessary, in\norder to make the contemplated movement, and then Ishmael, who was, on\nemergencies, as terrifically energetic, as he was sluggish in common,\nset about effecting his object without delay.\n\nNotwithstanding the industry and zeal of all engaged, the task was one\nof great labour and difficulty. The loaded vehicles were to be drawn by\nhand across a wide distance of plain without track or guide of any sort,\nexcept that which the trapper furnished by communicating his knowledge\nof the cardinal points of the compass. In accomplishing this object,\nthe gigantic strength of the men was taxed to the utmost, nor were the\nfemales or the children spared a heavy proportion of the toil. While the\nsons distributed themselves about the heavily loaded wagons, and drew\nthem by main strength up the neighbouring swell, their mother and Ellen,\nsurrounded by the amazed group of little ones, followed slowly in the\nrear, bending under the weight of such different articles as were suited\nto their several strengths.\n\nIshmael himself superintended and directed the whole, occasionally\napplying his colossal shoulder to some lagging vehicle, until he saw\nthat the chief difficulty, that of gaining the level of their intended\nroute, was accomplished. Then he pointed out the required course,\ncautioning his sons to proceed in such a manner that they should not\nlose the advantage they had with so much labour obtained, and beckoning\nto the brother of his wife, they returned together to the empty camp.\n\nThroughout the whole of this movement, which occupied an hour of time,\nthe trapper had stood apart, leaning on his rifle, with the aged hound\nslumbering at his feet, a silent but attentive observer of all that\npassed. Occasionally, a smile lighted his hard, muscular, but wasted\nfeatures, like a gleam of sunshine flitting across a ragged ruin, and\nbetrayed the momentary pleasure he found in witnessing from time to time\nthe vast power the youths discovered. Then, as the train drew slowly\nup the ascent, a cloud of thought and sorrow threw all into the shade\nagain, leaving the expression of his countenance in its usual state\nof quiet melancholy. As vehicle after vehicle left the place of the\nencampment, he noted the change, with increasing attention; seldom\nfailing to cast an enquiring look at the little neglected tent, which,\nwith its proper wagon, still remained as before, solitary and apparently\nforgotten. The summons of Ishmael to his gloomy associate had, however,\nas it would now seem, this hitherto neglected portion of his effects for\nits object.\n\nFirst casting a cautious and suspicious glance on every side of him, the\nsquatter and his companion advanced to the little wagon, and caused it\nto enter within the folds of the cloth, much in the manner that it had\nbeen extricated the preceding evening. They both then disappeared behind\nthe drapery, and many moments of suspense succeeded, during which the\nold man, secretly urged by a burning desire to know the meaning of so\nmuch mystery, insensibly drew nigh to the place, until he stood within\na few yards of the proscribed spot. The agitation of the cloth betrayed\nthe nature of the occupation of those whom it concealed, though their\nwork was conducted in rigid silence. It would appear that long practice\nhad made each of the two acquainted with his particular duty; for\nneither sign nor direction of any sort was necessary from Ishmael, in\norder to apprise his surly associate of the manner in which he was to\nproceed. In less time than has been consummated in relating it,\nthe interior portion of the arrangement was completed, when the men\nre-appeared without the tent. Too busy with his occupation to heed the\npresence of the trapper, Ishmael began to release the folds of the cloth\nfrom the ground, and to dispose of them in such a manner around the\nvehicle, as to form a sweeping train to the new form the little pavilion\nhad now assumed. The arched roof trembled with the occasional movement\nof the light vehicle which, it was now apparent, once more supported its\nsecret burden. Just as the work was ended the scowling eye of Ishmael's\nassistant caught a glimpse of the figure of the attentive observer of\ntheir movements. Dropping the shaft, which he had already lifted from\nthe ground preparatory to occupying the place that was usually filled\nby an animal less reasoning and perhaps less dangerous than himself, he\nbluntly exclaimed--\n\n\"I am a fool, as you often say! But look for yourself: if that man is\nnot an enemy, I will disgrace father and mother, call myself an Indian,\nand go hunt with the Siouxes!\"\n\nThe cloud, as it is about to discharge the subtle lightning, is not\nmore dark nor threatening, than the look with which Ishmael greeted the\nintruder. He turned his head on every side of him, as if seeking some\nengine sufficiently terrible to annihilate the offending trapper at a\nblow; and then, possibly recollecting the further occasion he might\nhave for his counsel, he forced himself to say, with an appearance of\nmoderation that nearly choked him--\n\n\"Stranger, I did believe this prying into the concerns of others was the\nbusiness of women in the towns and settlements, and not the manner in\nwhich men, who are used to live where each has room for himself, deal\nwith the secrets of their neighbours. To what lawyer or sheriff do you\ncalculate to sell your news?\"\n\n\"I hold but little discourse except with one and then chiefly of my\nown affairs,\" returned the old man, without the least observable\napprehension, and pointing imposingly upward; \"a Judge; and Judge of\nall. Little does he need knowledge from my hands, and but little will\nyour wish to keep any thing secret from him profit you, even in this\ndesert.\"\n\nThe mounting tempers of his unnurtured listeners were rebuked by\nthe simple, solemn manner of the trapper. Ishmael stood sullen and\nthoughtful; while his companion stole a furtive and involuntary glance\nat the placid sky, which spread so wide and blue above his head, as if\nhe expected to see the Almighty eye itself beaming from the heavenly\nvault. But impressions of a serious character are seldom lasting on\nminds long indulged in forgetfulness. The hesitation of the squatter was\nconsequently of short duration. The language, however, as well as the\nfirm and collected air of the speaker, were the means of preventing much\nsubsequent abuse, if not violence.\n\n\"It would be showing more of the kindness of a friend and comrade,\"\nIshmael returned, in a tone sufficiently sullen to betray his humour,\nthough it was no longer threatening, \"had your shoulder been put to the\nwheel of one of yonder wagons, instead of edging itself in here, where\nnone are wanted but such as are invited.\"\n\n\"I can put the little strength that is left me,\" returned the trapper,\n\"to this, as well as to another of your loads.\"\n\n\"Do you take us for boys!\" exclaimed Ishmael, laughing, half in ferocity\nand half in derision, applying his powerful strength at the same time\nto the little vehicle, which rolled over the grass with as much seeming\nfacility as if it were drawn by its usual team.\n\nThe trapper paused, and followed the departing wagon with his eye,\nmarvelling greatly as to the nature of its concealed contents, until it\nhad also gained the summit of the eminence, and in its turn disappeared\nbehind the swell of the land. Then he turned to gaze at the desolation\nof the scene around him. The absence of human forms would have scarce\ncreated a sensation in the bosom of one so long accustomed to solitude,\nhad not the site of the deserted camp furnished such strong memorials\nof its recent visitors, and as the old man was quick to detect, of their\nwaste also. He cast his eye upwards, with a shake of the head, at\nthe vacant spot in the heavens which had so lately been filled by\nthe branches of those trees that now lay stripped of their verdure,\nworthless and deserted logs, at his feet.\n\n\"Ay,\" he muttered to himself, \"I might have know'd it--I might have\nknow'd it! Often have I seen the same before; and yet I brought them\nto the spot myself, and have now sent them to the only neighbourhood of\ntheir kind within many long leagues of the spot where I stand. This is\nman's wish, and pride, and waste, and sinfulness! He tames the beasts of\nthe field to feed his idle wants; and, having robbed the brutes of their\nnatural food, he teaches them to strip the 'arth of its trees to quiet\ntheir hunger.\"\n\nA rustling in the low bushes which still grew, for some distance, along\nthe swale that formed the thicket on which the camp of Ishmael had\nrested, caught his ear, at the moment, and cut short the soliloquy. The\nhabits of so many years, spent in the wilderness, caused the old man\nto bring his rifle to a poise, with something like the activity and\npromptitude of his youth; but, suddenly recovering his recollection,\nhe dropped it into the hollow of his arm again, and resumed his air of\nmelancholy resignation.\n\n\"Come forth, come forth!\" he said aloud: \"be ye bird, or be ye beast, ye\nare safe from these old hands. I have eaten and I have drunk: why should\nI take life, when my wants call for no sacrifice? It will not be long\nafore the birds will peck at eyes that shall not see them, and perhaps\nlight on my very bones; for if things like these are only made to\nperish, why am I to expect to live for ever? Come forth, come forth; you\nare safe from harm at these weak hands.\"\n\n\"Thank you for the good word, old trapper!\" cried Paul Hover, springing\nactively forward from his place of concealment. \"There was an air about\nyou, when you threw forward the muzzle of the piece, that I did not\nlike; for it seemed to say that you were master of all the rest of the\nmotions.\"\n\n\"You are right, you are right!\" cried the trapper, laughing with inward\nself-complacency at the recollection of his former skill. \"The day has\nbeen when few men knew the virtues of a long rifle, like this I carry,\nbetter than myself, old and useless as I now seem. You are right, young\nman; and the time was, when it was dangerous to move a leaf within\near-shot of my stand; or,\" he added, dropping his voice, and looking\nserious, \"for a Red Mingo to show an eyeball from his ambushment. You\nhave heard of the Red Mingos?\"\n\n\"I have heard of minks,\" said Paul, taking the old man by the arm, and\ngently urging him towards the thicket as he spoke; while, at the same\ntime, he cast quick and uneasy glances behind him, in order to make sure\nhe was not observed. \"Of your common black minks; but none of any other\ncolour.\"\n\n\"Lord! Lord!\" continued the trapper, shaking his head, and still\nlaughing, in his deep but quiet manner; \"the boy mistakes a brute for a\nman! Though, a Mingo is little better than a beast; or, for that matter,\nhe is worse, when rum and opportunity are placed before his eyes. There\nwas that accursed Huron, from the upper lakes, that I knocked from his\nperch among the rocks in the hills, back of the Hori--\"\n\nHis voice was lost in the thicket, into which he had suffered himself to\nbe led by Paul while speaking, too much occupied by thoughts which dwelt\non scenes and acts that had taken place half a century earlier in the\nhistory of the country, to offer the smallest resistance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n   Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go look on. That\n   dissembling abominable varlet, Diomed, has got that same scurvy,\n   doting, foolish young knave in his helm.\n                                         --Troilus and Cressida.\n\nIt is necessary, in order that the thread of the narrative should not be\nspun to a length which might fatigue the reader, that he should imagine\na week to have intervened between the scene with which the preceding\nchapter closed and the events with which it is our intention to resume\nits relation in this. The season was on the point of changing its\ncharacter; the verdure of summer giving place more rapidly to the brown\nand party-coloured livery of the fall.[*] The heavens were clothed in\ndriving clouds, piled in vast masses one above the other, which whirled\nviolently in the gusts; opening, occasionally, to admit transient\nglimpses of the bright and glorious sight of the heavens, dwelling in a\nmagnificence by far too grand and durable to be disturbed by the fitful\nefforts of the lower world. Beneath, the wind swept across the wild and\nnaked prairies, with a violence that is seldom witnessed in any section\nof the continent less open. It would have been easy to have imagined,\nin the ages of fable, that the god of the winds had permitted his\nsubordinate agents to escape from their den, and that they now rioted,\nin wantonness, across wastes, where neither tree, nor work of man, nor\nmountain, nor obstacle of any sort, opposed itself to their gambols.\n\n    [*] The Americans call the autumn the \"fall,\" from the fall of the\n    leaf.\n\nThough nakedness might, as usual, be given as the pervading character of\nthe spot, whither it is now necessary to transfer the scene of the tale,\nit was not entirely without the signs of human life. Amid the monotonous\nrolling of the prairie, a single naked and ragged rock arose on the\nmargin of a little watercourse, which found its way, after winding a\nvast distance through the plains, into one of the numerous tributaries\nof the Father of Rivers. A swale of low land lay near the base of the\neminence; and as it was still fringed with a thicket of alders and\nsumack, it bore the signs of having once nurtured a feeble growth of\nwood. The trees themselves had been transferred, however, to the summit\nand crags of the neighbouring rocks. On this elevation the signs of man,\nto which the allusion just made applies, were to be found.\n\nSeen from beneath, there were visible a breast-work of logs and stones,\nintermingled in such a manner as to save all unnecessary labour, a\nfew low roofs made of bark and boughs of trees, an occasional barrier,\nconstructed like the defences on the summit, and placed on such points\nof the acclivity as were easier of approach than the general face of the\neminence; and a little dwelling of cloth, perched on the apex of a small\npyramid, that shot up on one angle of the rock, the white covering of\nwhich glimmered from a distance like a spot of snow, or, to make the\nsimile more suitable to the rest of the subject, like a spotless and\ncarefully guarded standard, which was to be protected by the dearest\nblood of those who defended the citadel beneath. It is hardly necessary\nto add, that this rude and characteristic fortress was the place where\nIshmael Bush had taken refuge, after the robbery of his flocks and\nherds.\n\nOn the day to which the narrative is advanced, the squatter was standing\nnear the base of the rocks, leaning on his rifle, and regarding the\nsterile soil that supported him with a look in which contempt and\ndisappointment were strongly blended.\n\n\"'Tis time to change our natur's,\" he observed to the brother of his\nwife, who was rarely far from his elbow; \"and to become ruminators,\ninstead of people used to the fare of Christians and free men. I reckon,\nAbiram, you could glean a living among the grasshoppers: you ar' an\nactive man, and might outrun the nimblest skipper of them all.\"\n\n\"The country will never do,\" returned the other, who relished but little\nthe forced humour of his kinsman; \"and it is well to remember that a\nlazy traveller makes a long journey.\"\n\n\"Would you have me draw a cart at my heels, across this desert for\nweeks,--ay, months?\" retorted Ishmael, who, like all of his class,\ncould labour with incredible efforts on emergencies, but who too seldom\nexerted continued industry, on any occasion, to brook a proposal that\noffered so little repose. \"It may do for your people, who live in\nsettlements, to hasten on to their houses; but, thank Heaven! my farm is\ntoo big for its owner ever to want a resting-place.\"\n\n\"Since you like the plantation, then, you have only to make your crop.\"\n\n\"That is easier said than done, on this corner of the estate. I tell\nyou, Abiram, there is need of moving, for more reasons than one. You\nknow I'm a man that very seldom enters into a bargain, but who always\nfulfils his agreements better than your dealers in wordy contracts\nwritten on rags of paper. If there's one mile, there ar' a hundred still\nneeded to make up the distance for which you have my honour.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the squatter glanced his eye upward at the little tenement\nof cloth which crowned the summit of his ragged fortress. The look was\nunderstood and answered by the other; and by some secret influence,\nwhich operated either through their interests or feelings, it served to\nre-establish that harmony between them, which had just been threatened\nwith something like a momentary breach.\n\n\"I know it, and feel it in every bone of my body. But I remember the\nreason, why I have set myself on this accursed journey too well to\nforget the distance between me and the end. Neither you nor I will ever\nbe the better for what we have done, unless we thoroughly finish what is\nso well begun. Ay, that is the doctrine of the whole world, I judge: I\nheard a travelling preacher, who was skirting it down the Ohio, a time\nsince, say, if a man should live up to the faith for a hundred years,\nand then fall from his work a single day, he would find the settlement\nwas to be made for the finishing blow that he had put to his job,\nand that all the bad, and none of the good, would come into the final\naccount.\"\n\n\"And you believed the hungry hypocrite!\"\n\n\"Who said that I believed it?\" retorted Abiram with a bullying look,\nthat betrayed how much his fears had dwelt on the subject he affected to\ndespise. \"Is it believing to tell what a roguish--And yet, Ishmael, the\nman might have been honest after all! He told us that the world was,\nin truth, no better than a desert, and that there was but one hand that\ncould lead the most learned man through all its crooked windings. Now,\nif this be true of the whole, it may be true of a part.\"\n\n\"Abiram, out with your grievances like a man,\" interrupted the squatter,\nwith a hoarse laugh. \"You want to pray! But of what use will it be,\naccording to your own doctrine, to serve God five minutes and the devil\nan hour? Harkee, friend; I'm not much of a husband-man, but this I know\nto my cost; that to make a right good crop, even on the richest bottom,\nthere must be hard labour; and your snufflers liken the 'arth to a\nfield of corn, and the men, who live on it, to its yield. Now I tell\nyou, Abiram, that you are no better than a thistle or a mullin; yea, ye\nar' wood of too open a pore to be good even to burn!\"\n\nThe malign glance, which shot from the scowling eye of Abiram, announced\nthe angry character of his feelings, but as the furtive look quailed,\nimmediately, before the unmoved, steady, countenance of the squatter, it\nalso betrayed how much the bolder spirit of the latter had obtained the\nmastery over his craven nature.\n\nContent with his ascendency, which was too apparent, and had been too\noften exerted on similar occasions, to leave him in any doubt of its\nextent, Ishmael coolly continued the discourse, by adverting more\ndirectly to his future plans.\n\n\"You will own the justice of paying every one in kind,\" he said; \"I have\nbeen robbed of my stock, and I have a scheme to make myself as good as\nbefore, by taking hoof for hoof; or for that matter, when a man is put\nto the trouble of bargaining for both sides, he is a fool if he don't\npay himself something in the way of commission.\"\n\nAs the squatter made this declaration in a tone which was a little\nexcited by the humour of the moment, four or five of his lounging sons,\nwho had been leaning against the foot of the rock, came forward with the\nindolent step so common to the family.\n\n\"I have been calling Ellen Wade, who is on the rock keeping the\nlook-out, to know if there is any thing to be seen,\" observed the eldest\nof the young men; \"and she shakes her head, for an answer. Ellen is\nsparing of her words for a woman; and might be taught manners at least,\nwithout spoiling her good looks.\"\n\nIshmael cast his eye upward to the place, where the offending, but\nunconscious girl was holding her anxious watch. She was seated at the\nedge of the uppermost crag, by the side of the little tent, and at least\ntwo hundred feet above the level of the plain. Little else was to be\ndistinguished, at that distance, but the outline of her form, her fair\nhair streaming in the gusts beyond her shoulders, and the steady and\nseemingly unchangeable look that she had riveted on some remote point of\nthe prairie.\n\n\"What is it, Nell?\" cried Ishmael, lifting his powerful voice a little\nabove the rushing of the element. \"Have you got a glimpse of any thing\nbigger than a burrowing barker?\"\n\nThe lips of the attentive Ellen parted; she rose to the utmost height\nher small stature admitted, seeming still to regard the unknown object;\nbut her voice, if she spoke at all, was not sufficiently loud to be\nheard amid the wind.\n\n\"It ar' a fact that the child sees something more uncommon than a\nbuffaloe or a prairie dog!\" continued Ishmael. \"Why, Nell, girl, ar'\nye deaf? Nell, I say;--I hope it is an army of red-skins she has in\nher eye; for I should relish the chance to pay them for their kindness,\nunder the favour of these logs and rocks!\"\n\nAs the squatter accompanied his vaunt with corresponding gestures, and\ndirected his eyes to the circle of his equally confident sons while\nspeaking, he drew their gaze from Ellen to himself; but now, when\nthey turned together to note the succeeding movements of their female\nsentinel, the place which had so lately been occupied by her form was\nvacant.\n\n\"As I am a sinner,\" exclaimed Asa, usually one of the most phlegmatic of\nthe youths, \"the girl is blown away by the wind!\"\n\nSomething like a sensation was exhibited among them, which might have\ndenoted that the influence of the laughing blue eyes, flaxen hair, and\nglowing cheeks of Ellen, had not been lost on the dull natures of the\nyoung men; and looks of amazement, mingled slightly with concern, passed\nfrom one to the other as they gazed, in dull wonder, at the point of the\nnaked rock.\n\n\"It might well be!\" added another; \"she sat on a slivered stone, and\nI have been thinking of telling her she was in danger for more than an\nhour.\"\n\n\"Is that a riband of the child, dangling from the corner of the hill\nbelow?\" cried Ishmael; \"ha! who is moving about the tent? have I not\ntold you all--\"\n\n\"Ellen! 'tis Ellen!\" interrupted the whole body of his sons in a breath;\nand at that instant she re-appeared to put an end to their different\nsurmises, and to relieve more than one sluggish nature from its unwonted\nexcitement. As Ellen issued from beneath the folds of the tent, she\nadvanced with a light and fearless step to her former giddy stand, and\npointed toward the prairie, appearing to speak in an eager and rapid\nvoice to some invisible auditor.\n\n\"Nell is mad!\" said Asa, half in contempt and yet not a little in\nconcern. \"The girl is dreaming with her eyes open; and thinks she sees\nsome of them fierce creatur's, with hard names, with which the Doctor\nfills her ears.\"\n\n\"Can it be, the child has found a scout of the Siouxes?\" said Ishmael,\nbending his look toward the plain; but a low, significant whisper from\nAbiram drew his eyes quickly upward again, where they were turned just\nin time to perceive that the cloth of the tent was agitated by a motion\nvery evidently different from the quivering occasioned by the wind. \"Let\nher, if she dare!\" the squatter muttered in his teeth. \"Abiram; they\nknow my temper too well to play the prank with me!\"\n\n\"Look for yourself! if the curtain is not lifted, I can see no better\nthan the owl by daylight.\"\n\nIshmael struck the breach of his rifle violently on the earth, and\nshouted in a voice that might easily have been heard by Ellen, had not\nher attention still continued rapt on the object which so unaccountably\nattracted her eyes in the distance.\n\n\"Nell!\" continued the squatter, \"away with you, fool! will you bring\ndown punishment on your own head? Why, Nell!--she has forgotten her\nnative speech; let us see if she can understand another language.\"\n\nIshmael threw his rifle to his shoulder, and at the next moment it was\npointed upward at the summit of the rock. Before time was given for\na word of remonstrance, it had sent forth its contents, in its usual\nstreak of bright flame. Ellen started like the frightened chamois, and\nuttering a piercing scream, she darted into the tent, with a swiftness\nthat left it uncertain whether terror or actual injury had been the\npenalty of her offence.\n\nThe action of the squatter was too sudden and unexpected to admit of\nprevention, but the instant it was done, his sons manifested, in an\nunequivocal manner, the temper with which they witnessed the desperate\nmeasure. Angry and fierce glances were interchanged, and a murmur of\ndisapprobation was uttered by the whole, in common.\n\n\"What has Ellen done, father,\" said Asa, with a degree of spirit, which\nwas the more striking from being unusual, \"that she should be shot at\nlike a straggling deer, or a hungry wolf?\"\n\n\"Mischief,\" deliberately returned the squatter; but with a cool\nexpression of defiance in his eye that showed how little he was moved by\nthe ill-concealed humour of his children. \"Mischief, boy; mischief! take\nyou heed that the disorder don't spread.\"\n\n\"It would need a different treatment in a man, than in yon screaming\ngirl!\"\n\n\"Asa, you ar' a man, as you have often boasted; but remember I am your\nfather, and your better.\"\n\n\"I know it well; and what sort of a father?\"\n\n\"Harkee, boy: I more than half believe that your drowsy head let in the\nSiouxes. Be modest in speech, my watchful son, or you may have to answer\nyet for the mischief your own bad conduct has brought upon us.\"\n\n\"I'll stay no longer to be hectored like a child in petticoats. You talk\nof law, as if you knew of none, and yet you keep me down, as though I\nhad not life and wants of my own. I'll stay no longer to be treated like\none of your meanest cattle!\"\n\n\"The world is wide, my gallant boy, and there's many a noble plantation\non it, without a tenant. Go; you have title deeds signed and sealed to\nyour hand. Few fathers portion their children better than Ishmael\nBush; you will say that for me, at least, when you get to be a wealthy\nlandholder.\"\n\n\"Look! father, look!\" exclaimed several voices at once, seizing with\navidity, an opportunity to interrupt a dialogue which threatened to\nbecome more violent.\n\n\"Look!\" repeated Abiram, in a voice which sounded hollow and warning;\n\"if you have time for any thing but quarrels, Ishmael, look!\"\n\nThe squatter turned slowly from his offending son, and cast an eye, that\nstill lowered with deep resentment upward; but which, the instant it\ncaught a view of the object that now attracted the attention of all\naround him, changed its expression to one of astonishment and dismay.\n\nA female stood on the spot, from which Ellen had been so fearfully\nexpelled. Her person was of the smallest size that is believed to\ncomport with beauty, and which poets and artists have chosen as the beau\nideal of feminine loveliness. Her dress was of a dark and glossy silk,\nand fluttered like gossamer around her form. Long, flowing, and curling\ntresses of hair, still blacker and more shining than her robe, fell\nat times about her shoulders, completely enveloping the whole of her\ndelicate bust in their ringlets; or at others streaming in the wind.\nThe elevation at which she stood prevented a close examination of\nthe lineaments of a countenance which, however, it might be seen was\nyouthful, and, at the moment of her unlooked-for appearance, eloquent\nwith feeling. So young, indeed, did this fair and fragile being appear,\nthat it might be doubted whether the age of childhood was entirely\npassed. One small and exquisitely moulded hand was pressed on her heart,\nwhile with the other she made an impressive gesture, which seemed to\ninvite Ishmael, if further violence was meditated, to direct it against\nher bosom.\n\nThe silent wonder, with which the group of borderers gazed upward at so\nextraordinary a spectacle, was only interrupted as the person of Ellen\nwas seen emerging with timidity from the tent, as if equally urged,\nby apprehensions in behalf of herself and the fears which she felt on\naccount of her companion, to remain concealed and to advance. She spoke,\nbut her words were unheard by those below, and unheeded by her to whom\nthey were addressed. The latter, however, as if content with the offer\nshe had made of herself as a victim to the resentment of Ishmael, now\ncalmly retired, and the spot she had so lately occupied became vacant,\nleaving a sort of stupid impression on the spectators beneath, not\nunlike that which it might be supposed would have been created had they\njust been gazing at some supernatural vision.\n\nMore than a minute of profound silence succeeded, during which the sons\nof Ishmael still continued gazing at the naked rock in stupid wonder.\nThen, as eye met eye, an expression of novel intelligence passed from\none to the other, indicating that to them, at least, the appearance of\nthis extraordinary tenant of the pavilion was as unexpected as it was\nincomprehensible. At length Asa, in right of his years, and moved by the\nrankling impulse of the recent quarrel, took on himself the office of\ninterrogator. Instead, however, of braving the resentment of his father,\nof whose fierce nature, when aroused, he had had too frequent evidence\nto excite it wantonly, he turned upon the cowering person of Abiram,\nobserving with a sneer--\n\n\"This then is the beast you were bringing into the prairies for a decoy!\nI know you to be a man who seldom troubles truth, when any thing worse\nmay answer, but I never knew you to outdo yourself so thoroughly before.\nThe newspapers of Kentuck have called you a dealer in black flesh a\nhundred times, but little did they reckon that you drove the trade into\nwhite families.\"\n\n\"Who is a kidnapper?\" demanded Abiram, with a blustering show of\nresentment. \"Am I to be called to account for every lie they put in\nprint throughout the States? Look to your own family, boy; look to\nyourselves. The very stumps of Kentucky and Tennessee cry out ag'in\nye! Ay, my tonguey gentleman, I have seen father and mother and three\nchildren, yourself for one, published on the logs and stubs of the\nsettlements, with dollars enough for reward to have made an honest man\nrich, for--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a back-handed but violent blow on the mouth, that\ncaused him to totter, and which left the impression of its weight in the\nstarting blood and swelling lips.\n\n\"Asa,\" said the father, advancing with a portion of that dignity with\nwhich the hand of Nature seems to have invested the parental character,\n\"you have struck the brother of your mother!\"\n\n\"I have struck the abuser of the whole family,\" returned the angry\nyouth; \"and, unless he teaches his tongue a wiser language, he had\nbetter part with it altogether, as the unruly member. I'm no great\nperformer with the knife, but, on an occasion, could make out, myself,\nto cut off a slande--\"\n\n\"Boy, twice have you forgotten yourself to-day. Be careful that it does\nnot happen the third time. When the law of the land is weak, it is right\nthe law of nature should be strong. You understand me, Asa; and you know\nme. As for you, Abiram, the child has done you wrong, and it is my place\nto see you righted. Remember; I tell you justice shall be done; it is\nenough. But you have said hard things ag'in me and my family. If the\nhounds of the law have put their bills on the trees and stumps of the\nclearings, it was for no act of dishonesty as you know, but because we\nmaintain the rule that 'arth is common property. No, Abiram; could I\nwash my hands of things done by your advice, as easily as I can of the\nthings done by the whisperings of the devil, my sleep would be quieter\nat night, and none who bear my name need blush to hear it mentioned.\nPeace, Asa, and you too, man; enough has been said. Let us all think\nwell before any thing is added, that may make what is already so bad\nstill more bitter.\"\n\nIshmael waved his hand with authority, as he ended, and turned away with\nthe air of one who felt assured, that those he had addressed would not\nhave the temerity to dispute his commands. Asa evidently struggled with\nhimself to compel the required obedience, but his heavy nature quietly\nsunk into its ordinary repose, and he soon appeared again the being he\nreally was; dangerous, only, at moments, and one whose passions were\ntoo sluggish to be long maintained at the point of ferocity. Not so with\nAbiram. While there was an appearance of a personal conflict, between\nhim and his colossal nephew, his mien had expressed the infallible\nevidences of engrossing apprehension, but now, that the authority as\nwell as gigantic strength of the father were interposed between him and\nhis assailant, his countenance changed from paleness to a livid hue,\nthat bespoke how deeply the injury he had received rankled in his\nbreast. Like Asa, however, he acquiesced in the decision of the\nsquatter; and the appearance, at least, of harmony was restored again\namong a set of beings, who were restrained by no obligations more\npowerful than the frail web of authority with which Ishmael had been\nable to envelope his children.\n\nOne effect of the quarrel had been to divert the thoughts of the young\nmen from their recent visitor. With the dispute, that succeeded the\ndisappearance of the fair stranger, all recollection of her existence\nappeared to have vanished. A few ominous and secret conferences, it is\ntrue, were held apart, during which the direction of the eyes of\nthe different speakers betrayed their subject; but these threatening\nsymptoms soon disappeared, and the whole party was again seen broken\ninto its usual, listless, silent, and lounging groups.\n\n\"I will go upon the rock, boys, and look abroad for the savages,\" said\nIshmael shortly after, advancing towards them with a mien which\nhe intended should be conciliating, at the same time that it was\nauthoritative.\n\n\"If there is nothing to fear, we will go out on the plain; the day is\ntoo good to be lost in words, like women in the towns wrangling over\ntheir tea and sugared cakes.\"\n\nWithout waiting for approbation or dissent, the squatter advanced to\nthe base of the rock, which formed a sort of perpendicular wall, nearly\ntwenty feet high around the whole acclivity. Ishmael, however, directed\nhis footsteps to a point where an ascent might be made through a narrow\ncleft, which he had taken the precaution to fortify with a breast-work\nof cottonwood logs, and which, in its turn, was defended by a\nchevaux-de-frise of the branches of the same tree. Here an armed man was\nusually kept, as at the key of the whole position, and here one of\nthe young men now stood, indolently leaning against the rock, ready to\nprotect the pass, if it should prove necessary, until the whole party\ncould be mustered at the several points of defence.\n\nFrom this place the squatter found the ascent still difficult, partly by\nnature and partly by artificial impediments, until he reached a sort of\nterrace, or, to speak more properly, the plain of the elevation, where\nhe had established the huts in which the whole family dwelt. These\ntenements were, as already mentioned, of that class which are so\noften seen on the borders, and such as belonged to the infancy of\narchitecture; being simply formed of logs, bark, and poles. The area\non which they stood contained several hundred square feet, and was\nsufficiently elevated above the plain greatly to lessen if not to remove\nall danger from Indian missiles. Here Ishmael believed he might leave\nhis infants in comparative security, under the protection of their\nspirited mother, and here he now found Esther engaged at her ordinary\ndomestic employments, surrounded by her daughters, and lifting her\nvoice, in declamatory censure, as one or another of the idle fry\nincurred her displeasure, and far too much engrossed with the tempest\nof her own conversation to know any thing of the violent scene which had\nbeen passing below.\n\n\"A fine windy place you have chosen for the camp, Ishmael!\" she\ncommenced, or rather continued, by merely diverting the attack from\na sobbing girl of ten, at her elbow, to her husband. \"My word! if I\nhaven't to count the young ones every ten minutes, to see they are\nnot flying away among the buzzards, or the ducks. Why do ye all keep\nhovering round the rock, like lolloping reptiles in the spring, when the\nheavens are beginning to be alive with birds, man. D'ye think mouths can\nbe filled, and hunger satisfied, by laziness and sleep!\"\n\n\"You'll have your say, Eester,\" said the husband, using the provincial\npronunciation of America for the name, and regarding his noisy\ncompanions, with a look of habitual tolerance rather than of affection.\n\"But the birds you shall have, if your own tongue don't frighten them to\ntake too high a flight. Ay, woman,\" he continued, standing on the very\nspot whence he had so rudely banished Ellen, which he had by this time\ngained, \"and buffaloe too, if my eye can tell the animal at the distance\nof a Spanish league.\"\n\n\"Come down; come down, and be doing, instead of talking. A talking man\nis no better than a barking dog. I shall hang out the cloth, if any of\nthe red-skins show themselves, in time to give you notice. But, Ishmael,\nwhat have you been killing, my man; for it was your rifle I heard a few\nminutes agone, unless I have lost my skill in sounds.\"\n\n\"Poh! 'twas to frighten the hawk you see sailing above the rock.\"\n\n\"Hawk, indeed! at your time of day to be shooting at hawks and buzzards,\nwith eighteen open mouths to feed. Look at the bee, and at the beaver,\nmy good man, and learn to be a provider. Why, Ishmael! I believe my\nsoul,\" she continued, dropping the tow she was twisting on a distaff,\n\"the man is in that tent ag'in! More than half his time is spent about\nthe worthless, good-for-nothing--\"\n\nThe sudden re-appearance of her husband closed the mouth of the wife;\nand, as the former descended to the place where Esther had resumed\nher employment, she was content to grumble forth her dissatisfaction,\ninstead of expressing it in more audible terms.\n\nThe dialogue that now took place between the affectionate pair was\nsufficiently succinct and expressive. The woman was at first a little\nbrief and sullen in her answers, but care for her family soon rendered\nher more complaisant. As the purport of the conversation was merely an\nengagement to hunt during the remainder of the day, in order to provide\nthe chief necessary of life, we shall not stop to record it.\n\nWith this resolution, then, the squatter descended to the plain and\ndivided his forces into two parts, one of which was to remain as a\nguard with the fortress, and the other to accompany him to the field.\nHe warily included Asa and Abiram in his own party, well knowing that\nno authority short of his own was competent to repress the fierce\ndisposition of his headlong son, if fairly awakened. When these\narrangements were completed, the hunters sallied forth, separating at\nno great distance from the rock, in order to form a circle about the\ndistant herd of buffaloes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n                         Priscian a little scratch'd;\n                 'Twill serve.\n                                           --Love's Labour Lost.\n\nHaving made the reader acquainted with the manner in which Ishmael Bush\nhad disposed of his family, under circumstances that might have proved\nso embarrassing to most other men, we shall again shift the scene a few\nshort miles from the place last described, preserving, however, the due\nand natural succession of time. At the very moment that the squatter and\nhis sons departed in the manner mentioned in the preceding chapter, two\nmen were intently occupied in a swale that lay along the borders of a\nlittle run, just out of cannon-shot from the encampment, discussing\nthe merits of a savoury bison's hump, that had been prepared for their\npalates with the utmost attention to the particular merits of that\ndescription of food. The choice morsel had been judiciously separated\nfrom the adjoining and less worthy parts of the beast, and, enveloped in\nthe hairy coating provided by nature, it had duly undergone the heat\nof the customary subterraneous oven, and was now laid before its\nproprietors in all the culinary glory of the prairies. So far as\nrichness, delicacy, and wildness of flavour, and substantial nourishment\nwere concerned, the viand might well have claimed a decided superiority\nover the meretricious cookery and laboured compounds of the most\nrenowned artist; though the service of the dainty was certainly achieved\nin a manner far from artificial. It would appear that the two fortunate\nmortals, to whose happy lot it fell to enjoy a meal in which health and\nappetite lent so keen a relish to the exquisite food of the American\ndeserts, were far from being insensible of the advantage they possessed.\n\nThe one, to whose knowledge in the culinary art the other was indebted\nfor his banquet, seemed the least disposed of the two to profit by his\nown skill. He ate, it is true, and with a relish; but it was always with\nthe moderation with which age is apt to temper the appetite. No such\nrestraint, however, was imposed on the inclination of his companion.\nIn the very flower of his days and in the vigour of manhood, the homage\nthat he paid to the work of his more aged friend's hands was of the most\nprofound and engrossing character. As one delicious morsel succeeded\nanother he rolled his eyes towards his companion, and seemed to express\nthat gratitude which he had not speech to utter, in looks of the most\nbenignant nature.\n\n\"Cut more into the heart of it, lad,\" said the trapper, for it was the\nvenerable inhabitant of those vast wastes, who had served the bee-hunter\nwith the banquet in question; \"cut more into the centre of the piece;\nthere you will find the genuine riches of natur'; and that without need\nfrom spices, or any of your biting mustard to give it a foreign relish.\"\n\n\"If I had but a cup of metheglin,\" said Paul, stopping to perform the\nnecessary operation of breathing, \"I should swear this was the strongest\nmeal that was ever placed before the mouth of man!\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, well you may call it strong!\" returned the other, laughing\nafter his peculiar manner, in pure satisfaction at witnessing the\ninfinite contentment of his companion; \"strong it is, and strong it\nmakes him who eats it! Here, Hector,\" tossing the patient hound, who was\nwatching his eye with a wistful look, a portion of the meat, \"you have\nneed of strength, my friend, in your old days as well as your master.\nNow, lad, there is a dog that has eaten and slept wiser and better, ay,\nand that of richer food, than any king of them all! and why? because he\nhas used and not abused the gifts of his Maker. He was made a hound, and\nlike a hound has he feasted. Then did He create men; but they have eaten\nlike famished wolves! A good and prudent dog has Hector proved, and\nnever have I found one of his breed false in nose or friendship. Do you\nknow the difference between the cookery of the wilderness and that\nwhich is found in the settlements? No; I see plainly you don't, by your\nappetite; then I will tell you. The one follows man, the other natur'.\nOne thinks he can add to the gifts of the Creator, while the other is\nhumble enough to enjoy them; therein lies the secret.\"\n\n\"I tell you, trapper,\" said Paul, who was very little edified by the\nmorality with which his associate saw fit to season their repast, \"that,\nevery day while we are in this place, and they are likely to be many, I\nwill shoot a buffaloe and you shall cook his hump!\"\n\n\"I cannot say that, I cannot say that. The beast is good, take him in\nwhat part you will, and it was to be food for man that he was fashioned;\nbut I cannot say that I will be a witness and a helper to the waste of\nkilling one daily.\"\n\n\"The devil a bit of waste shall there be, old man. If they all turn out\nas good as this, I will engage to eat them clean myself, even to the\nhoofs;--how now, who comes here! some one with a long nose, I will\nanswer; and one that has led him on a true scent, if he is following the\ntrail of a dinner.\"\n\nThe individual who interrupted the conversation, and who had elicited\nthe foregoing remark of Paul, was seen advancing along the margin of the\nrun with a deliberate pace, in a direct line for the two revellers.\nAs there was nothing formidable nor hostile in his appearance, the\nbee-hunter, instead of suspending his operations, rather increased his\nefforts, in a manner which would seem to imply that he doubted whether\nthe hump would suffice for the proper entertainment of all who were now\nlikely to partake of the delicious morsel. With the trapper, however,\nthe case was different. His more tempered appetite was already\nsatisfied, and he faced the new comer with a look of cordiality, that\nplainly evinced how very opportune he considered his arrival.\n\n\"Come on, friend,\" he said, waving his hand, as he observed the stranger\nto pause a moment, apparently in doubt. \"Come on, I say, if hunger be\nyour guide, it has led you to a fitting place. Here is meat, and this\nyouth can give you corn, parch'd till it be whiter than the upland snow;\ncome on, without fear. We are not ravenous beasts, eating of each other,\nbut Christian men, receiving thankfully that which the Lord hath seen\nfit to give.\"\n\n\"Venerable hunter,\" returned the Doctor, for it was no other than the\nnaturalist on one of his daily exploring expeditions, \"I rejoice greatly\nat this happy meeting; we are lovers of the same pursuits, and should be\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Lord, Lord!\" said the old man, laughing, without much deference to the\nrules of decorum, in the philosopher's very face, \"it is the man who\nwanted to make me believe that a name could change the natur' of a\nbeast! Come, friend; you are welcome, though your notions are a little\nblinded with reading too many books. Sit ye down, and, after eating\nof this morsel, tell me, if you can, the name of the creatur' that has\nbestowed on you its flesh for a meal?\"\n\nThe eyes of Doctor Battius (for we deem it decorous to give the good man\nthe appellation he most preferred) sufficiently denoted the satisfaction\nwith which he listened to this proposal. The exercise he had taken, and\nthe sharpness of the wind, proved excellent stimulants; and Paul himself\nhad hardly been in better plight to do credit to the trapper's cookery,\nthan was the lover of nature, when the grateful invitation met his\nears. Indulging in a small laugh, which his exertions to repress reduced\nnearly to a simper, he took the indicated seat by the old man's side,\nand made the customary dispositions to commence his meal without further\nceremony.\n\n\"I should be ashamed of my profession,\" he said, swallowing a morsel of\nthe hump with evident delight, slily endeavouring at the same time to\ndistinguish the peculiarities of the singed and defaced skin, \"I ought\nto be ashamed of my profession, were there beast, or bird, on the\ncontinent of America, that I could not tell by some one of the many\nevidences which science has enlisted in her cause. This--then--the\nfood is nutritious and savoury--a mouthful of your corn, friend, if you\nplease?\"\n\nPaul, who continued eating with increasing industry, looking askaunt not\nunlike a dog when engaged in the same agreeable pursuit, threw him his\npouch, without deeming it at all necessary to suspend his own labours.\n\n\"You were saying, friend, that you have many ways of telling the\ncreatur'?\"--observed the attentive trapper.\n\n\"Many; many and infallible. Now, the animals that are carnivorous are\nknown by their incisores.\"\n\n\"Their what?\" demanded the trapper.\n\n\"The teeth with which nature has furnished them for defence, and in\norder to tear their food. Again--\"\n\n\"Look you then for the teeth of this creatur',\" interrupted the\ntrapper, who was bent on convincing a man who had presumed to enter into\ncompetition with himself, in matters pertaining to the wilds, of gross\nignorance; \"turn the piece round and find your inside-overs.\"\n\nThe Doctor complied, and of course without success; though he profited\nby the occasion to take another fruitless glance at the wrinkled hide.\n\n\"Well, friend, do you find the things you need, before you can pronounce\nthe creatur' a duck or a salmon?\"\n\n\"I apprehend the entire animal is not here?\"\n\n\"You may well say as much,\" cried Paul, who was now compelled to pause\nfrom pure repletion; \"I will answer for some pounds of the fellow,\nweighed by the truest steel-yards west of the Alleghanies. Still you may\nmake out to keep soul and body together, with what is left,\" reluctantly\neyeing a piece large enough to feed twenty men, but which he felt\ncompelled to abandon from satiety; \"cut in nigher to the heart, as the\nold man says, and you will find the riches of the piece.\"\n\n\"The heart!\" exclaimed the Doctor, inwardly delighted to learn there was\na distinct organ to be submitted to his inspection. \"Ay, let me see the\nheart--it will at once determine the character of the animal--certes\nthis is not the cor--ay, sure enough it is--the animal must be of the\norder belluae, from its obese habits!\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a long and hearty, but still a noiseless fit of\nmerriment, from the trapper, which was considered so ill-timed by the\noffended naturalist, as to produce an instant cessation of speech, if\nnot a stagnation of ideas.\n\n\"Listen to his beasts' habits and belly orders,\" said the old man,\ndelighted with the evident embarrassment of his rival; \"and then he says\nit is not the core! Why, man, you are farther from the truth than you\nare from the settlements, with all your bookish larning and hard words;\nwhich I have, once for all, said cannot be understood by any tribe or\nnation east of the Rocky Mountains. Beastly habits or no beastly habits,\nthe creatur's are to be seen cropping the prairies by tens of thousands,\nand the piece in your hand is the core of as juicy a buffaloe-hump as\nstomach need crave!\"\n\n\"My aged companion,\" said Obed, struggling to keep down a rising\nirascibility, that he conceived would ill comport with the dignity\nof his character, \"your system is erroneous, from the premises to the\nconclusion; and your classification so faulty, as utterly to confound\nthe distinctions of science. The buffaloe is not gifted with a hump at\nall; nor is his flesh savoury and wholesome, as I must acknowledge it\nwould seem the subject before us may well be characterised--\"\n\n\"There I'm dead against you, and clearly with the trapper,\" interrupted\nPaul Hover. \"The man who denies that buffaloe beef is good, should scorn\nto eat it!\"[*]\n\n    [*] It is scarcely necessary to tell the reader, that the animal so\n    often alluded to in this book, and which is vulgarly called the\n    buffaloe, is in truth the bison; hence so many contretemps\n    between the men of the prairies and the men of science.\n\nThe Doctor, whose observation of the bee-hunter had hitherto been\nexceedingly cursory, stared at the new speaker with a look which denoted\nsomething like recognition.\n\n\"The principal characteristics of your countenance, friend,\" he said,\n\"are familiar; either you, or some other specimen of your class, is\nknown to me.\"\n\n\"I am the man you met in the woods east of the big river, and whom you\ntried to persuade to line a yellow hornet to his nest: as if my eye was\nnot too true to mistake any other animal for a honey-bee, in a clear\nday! We tarried together a week, as you may remember; you at your toads\nand lizards, and I at my high-holes and hollow trees: and a good job we\nmade of it between us! I filled my tubs with the sweetest honey I ever\nsent to the settlements, besides housing a dozen hives; and your bag was\nnear bursting with a crawling museum. I never was bold enough to put\nthe question to your face, stranger, but I reckon you are a keeper of\ncuriosities?\"[*]\n\n    [*] The pursuit of a bee-hunter is not uncommon, on the skirts of\n    American society, though it is a little embellished here. When the\n    bees are seen sucking the flowers, their pursuer contrives to\n    capture one or two. He then chooses a proper spot, and suffering\n    one to escape, the insect invariably takes its flight towards the\n    hive. Changing his ground to a greater or less distance according\n    to circumstances, the bee-hunter then permits another to escape.\n    Having watched the courses of the bees, which is technically\n    called lining, he is enabled to calculate the intersecting angle\n    of the two lines, which is the hive.\n\n\"Ay! that is another of their wanton wickednesses!\" exclaimed the\ntrapper. \"They slay the buck, and the moose, and the wild cat, and all\nthe beasts that range the woods, and stuffing them with worthless rags,\nand placing eyes of glass into their heads, they set them up to be\nstared at, and call them the creatur's of the Lord; as if any mortal\neffigy could equal the works of his hand!\"\n\n\"I know you well,\" returned the Doctor, on whom the plaint of the old\nman produced no visible impression. \"I know you,\" offering his hand\ncordially to Paul; \"it was a prolific week, as my herbal and catalogues\nshall one day prove. Ay, I remember you well, young man. You are of\nthe class, mammalia; order, primates; genus, homo; species, Kentucky.\"\nPausing to smile at his own humour, the naturalist proceeded. \"Since\nour separation, I have journeyed far, having entered into a compactum or\nagreement with a certain man named Ishmael--\"\n\n\"Bush!\" interrupted the impatient and reckless Paul. \"By the Lord,\ntrapper, this is the very blood-letter that Ellen told me of!\"\n\n\"Then Nelly has not done me credit for what I trust I deserve,\" returned\nthe single-minded Doctor, \"for I am not of the phlebotomising school at\nall; greatly preferring the practice which purifies the blood instead of\nabstracting it.\"\n\n\"It was a blunder of mine, good stranger; the girl called you a skilful\nman.\"\n\n\"Therein she may have exceeded my merits,\" Dr. Battius continued,\nbowing with sufficient meekness. \"But Ellen is a good, and a kind, and a\nspirited girl, too. A kind and a sweet girl I have ever found Nell Wade\nto be!\"\n\n\"The devil you have!\" cried Paul, dropping the morsel he was sucking,\nfrom sheer reluctance to abandon the hump, and casting a fierce and\ndirect look into the very teeth of the unconscious physician. \"I reckon,\nstranger, you have a mind to bag Ellen, too!\"\n\n\"The riches of the whole vegetable and animal world united, would not\ntempt me to harm a hair of her head! I love the child, with what may he\ncalled amor naturalis--or rather paternus--the affection of a father.\"\n\n\"Ay--that, indeed, is more befitting the difference in your years,\"\nPaul coolly rejoined, stretching forth his hand to regain the rejected\nmorsel. \"You would be no better than a drone at your time of day, with a\nyoung hive to feed and swarm.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is reason, because there is natur', in what he says,\"\nobserved the trapper: \"but, friend, you have said you were a dweller in\nthe camp of one Ishmael Bush?\"\n\n\"True; it is in virtue of a compactum--\"\n\n\"I know but little of the virtue of packing, though I follow trapping,\nin my old age, for a livelihood. They tell me that skins are well kept\nin the new fashion; but it is long since I have left off killing more\nthan I need for food and garments. I was an eye-witness, myself, of the\nmanner in which the Siouxes broke into your encampment, and drove off\nthe cattle; stripping the poor man you call Ishmael of his smallest\nhoofs, counting even the cloven feet.\"\n\n\"Asinus excepted,\" muttered the Doctor, who by this time was discussing\nhis portion of the hump, in utter forgetfulness of all its scientific\nattributes. \"Asinus domesticus Americanus excepted.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear that so many of them are saved, though I know not\nthe value of the animals you name; which is nothing uncommon, seeing how\nlong it is that I have been out of the settlements. But can you tell me,\nfriend, what the traveller carries under the white cloth, he guards with\nteeth as sharp as a wolf that quarrels for the carcass the hunter has\nleft?\"\n\n\"You've heard of it!\" exclaimed the other, dropping the morsel he was\nconveying to his mouth in manifest surprise.\n\n\"Nay, I have heard nothing; but I have seen the cloth, and had like\nto have been bitten for no greater crime than wishing to know what it\ncovered.\"\n\n\"Bitten! then, after all, the animal must be carnivorous! It is too\ntranquil for the ursus horridus; if it were the canis latrans, the voice\nwould betray it. Nor would Nelly Wade be so familiar with any of the\ngenus ferae. Venerable hunter! the solitary animal confined in\nthat wagon by day, and in the tent at night, has occasioned me more\nperplexity of mind than the whole catalogue of quadrupeds besides: and\nfor this plain reason; I did not know how to class it.\"\n\n\"You think it a ravenous beast?\"\n\n\"I know it to be a quadruped: your own danger proves it to be\ncarnivorous.\"\n\nDuring this broken explanation, Paul Hover had sat silent and\nthoughtful, regarding each speaker with deep attention. But, suddenly\nmoved by the manner of the Doctor, the latter had scarcely time to utter\nhis positive assertion, before the young man bluntly demanded--\n\n\"And pray, friend, what may you call a quadruped?\"\n\n\"A vagary of nature, wherein she has displayed less of her infinite\nwisdom than is usual. Could rotary levers be substituted for two of the\nlimbs, agreeably to the improvement in my new order of phalangacrura,\nwhich might be rendered into the vernacular as lever-legged, there would\nbe a delightful perfection and harmony in the construction. But, as the\nquadruped is now formed, I call it a mere vagary of nature; no other\nthan a vagary.\"\n\n\"Harkee, stranger! in Kentucky we are but small dealers in dictionaries.\nVagary is as hard a word to turn into English as quadruped.\"\n\n\"A quadruped is an animal with four legs--a beast.\"\n\n\"A beast! Do you then reckon that Ishmael Bush travels with a beast\ncaged in that wagon?\"\n\n\"I know it, and lend me your ear--not literally, friend,\" observing Paul\nto start and look surprised, \"but figuratively, through its functions,\nand you shall hear. I have already made known that, in virtue of a\ncompactum, I journey with the aforesaid Ishmael Bush; but though I am\nbound to perform certain duties while the journey lasts, there is no\ncondition which says that the said journey shall be sempiternum, or\neternal. Now, though this region may scarcely be said to be wedded\nto science, being to all intents a virgin territory as respects the\nenquirer into natural history, still it is greatly destitute of the\ntreasures of the vegetable kingdom. I should, therefore, have tarried\nsome hundreds of miles more to the eastward, were it not for the inward\npropensity that I feel to have the beast in question inspected and\nsuitably described and classed. For that matter,\" he continued, dropping\nhis voice, like one who imparts an important secret, \"I am not without\nhopes of persuading Ishmael to let me dissect it.\"\n\n\"You have seen the creature?\"\n\n\"Not with the organs of sight; but with much more infallible instruments\nof vision: the conclusions of reason, and the deductions of scientific\npremises. I have watched the habits of the animal, young man; and can\nfearlessly pronounce, by evidence that would be thrown away on ordinary\nobservers, that it is of vast dimensions, inactive, possibly torpid, of\nvoracious appetite, and, as it now appears by the direct testimony of\nthis venerable hunter, ferocious and carnivorous!\"\n\n\"I should be better pleased, stranger,\" said Paul, on whom the Doctor's\ndescription was making a very sensible impression, \"to be sure the\ncreature was a beast at all.\"\n\n\"As to that, if I wanted evidence of a fact, which is abundantly\napparent by the habits of the animal, I have the word of Ishmael\nhimself. A reason can be given for my smallest deductions. I am not\ntroubled, young man, with a vulgar and idle curiosity, but all my\naspirations after knowledge, as I humbly believe, are, first, for\nthe advancement of learning, and, secondly, for the benefit of my\nfellow-creatures. I pined greatly in secret to know the contents of the\ntent, which Ishmael guarded so carefully, and which he had covenanted\nthat I should swear, (jurare per deos) not to approach nigher than\na defined number of cubits, for a definite period of time. Your\njusjurandum, or oath, is a serious matter, and not to be dealt in\nlightly; but, as my expedition depended on complying, I consented to the\nact, reserving to myself at all times the power of distant observation.\nIt is now some ten days since Ishmael, pitying the state in which he\nsaw me, a humble lover of science, imparted the fact that the vehicle\ncontained a beast, which he was carrying into the prairies as a decoy,\nby which he intends to entrap others of the same genus, or perhaps\nspecies. Since then, my task has been reduced simply to watch the\nhabits of the animal, and to record the results. When we reach a certain\ndistance where these beasts are said to abound, I am to have the liberal\nexamination of the specimen.\"\n\nPaul continued to listen, in the most profound silence, until the\nDoctor concluded his singular but characteristic explanation; then the\nincredulous bee-hunter shook his head, and saw fit to reply, by saying--\n\n\"Stranger, old Ishmael has burrowed you in the very bottom of a hollow\ntree, where your eyes will be of no more use than the sting of a drone.\nI, too, know something of that very wagon, and I may say that I have\nlined the squatter down into a flat lie. Harkee, friend; do you think a\ngirl, like Ellen Wade, would become the companion of a wild beast?\"\n\n\"Why not? why not?\" repeated the naturalist; \"Nelly has a taste,\nand often listens with pleasure to the treasures that I am sometimes\ncompelled to scatter in this desert. Why should she not study the habits\nof any animal, even though it were a rhinoceros?\"\n\n\"Softly, softly,\" returned the equally positive, and, though less\nscientific, certainly, on this subject, better instructed bee-hunter;\n\"Ellen is a girl of spirit, and one too that knows her own mind, or\nI'm much mistaken; but with all her courage and brave looks, she is no\nbetter than a woman after all. Haven't I often had the girl crying--\"\n\n\"You are an acquaintance, then, of Nelly's?\"\n\n\"The devil a bit. But I know woman is woman; and all the books in\nKentucky couldn't make Ellen Wade go into a tent alone with a ravenous\nbeast!\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" the trapper calmly observed, \"that there is something\ndark and hidden in this matter. I am a witness that the traveller likes\nnone to look into the tent, and I have a proof more sure than what\neither of you can lay claim to, that the wagon does not carry the cage\nof a beast. Here is Hector, come of a breed with noses as true and\nfaithful as a hand that is all-powerful has made any of their kind, and\nhad there been a beast in the place, the hound would long since have\ntold it to his master.\"\n\n\"Do you pretend to oppose a dog to a man! brutality to learning!\ninstinct to reason!\" exclaimed the Doctor in some heat. \"In what manner,\npray, can a hound distinguish the habits, species, or even the genus of\nan animal, like reasoning, learned, scientific, triumphant man!\"\n\n\"In what manner!\" coolly repeated the veteran woodsman. \"Listen; and if\nyou believe that a schoolmaster can make a quicker wit than the Lord,\nyou shall be made to see how much you're mistaken. Do you not hear\nsomething move in the brake? it has been cracking the twigs these five\nminutes. Now tell me what the creatur' is?\"\n\n\"I hope nothing ferocious!\" exclaimed the Doctor, who still retained a\nlively impression of his rencounter with the vespertilio horribilis.\n\"You have rifles, friends; would it not be prudent to prime them? for\nthis fowling piece of mine is little to be depended on.\"\n\n\"There may be reason in what he says,\" returned the trapper, so far\ncomplying as to take his piece from the place where it had lain during\nthe repast, and raising its muzzle in the air. \"Now tell me the name of\nthe creatur'?\"\n\n\"It exceeds the limits of earthly knowledge! Buffon himself could not\ntell whether the animal was a quadruped, or of the order, serpens! a\nsheep, or a tiger!\"\n\n\"Then was your buffoon a fool to my Hector! Here: pup!--What is it,\ndog?--Shall we run it down, pup--or shall we let it pass?\"\n\nThe hound, which had already manifested to the experienced trapper, by\nthe tremulous motion of his ears, his consciousness of the proximity of\na strange animal, lifted his head from his fore paws and slightly parted\nhis lips, as if about to show the remnants of his teeth. But, suddenly\nabandoning his hostile purpose, he snuffed the air a moment, gaped\nheavily, shook himself, and peaceably resumed his recumbent attitude.\n\n\"Now, Doctor,\" cried the trapper, triumphantly, \"I am well convinced\nthere is neither game nor ravenous beast in the thicket; and that I call\nsubstantial knowledge to a man who is too old to be a spendthrift of his\nstrength, and yet who would not wish to be a meal for a panther!\"\n\nThe dog interrupted his master by a growl, but still kept his head\ncrouched to the earth.\n\n\"It is a man!\" exclaimed the trapper, rising. \"It is a man, if I am a\njudge of the creatur's ways. There is but little said atwixt the hound\nand me, but we seldom mistake each other's meaning!\"\n\nPaul Hover sprang to his feet like lightning; and, throwing forward his\nrifle, he cried in a voice of menace--\n\n\"Come forward, if a friend; if an enemy, stand ready for the worst!\"\n\n\"A friend, a white man, and, I hope, a Christian,\" returned a voice\nfrom the thicket; which opened at the same instant, and at the next the\nspeaker made his appearance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n                     Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear\n             How he will shake me up.\n                                               --As you like it.\n\nIt is well known, that even long before the immense regions of Louisiana\nchanged their masters for the second, and, as it is to be hoped, for the\nlast time, its unguarded territory was by no means safe from the inroads\nof white adventurers. The semi-barbarous hunters from the Canadas, the\nsame description of population, a little more enlightened, from the\nStates, and the metiffs or half-breeds, who claimed to be ranked in the\nclass of white men, were scattered among the different Indian tribes, or\ngleaned a scanty livelihood in solitude, amid the haunts of the beaver\nand the bison; or, to adopt the popular nomenclature of the country of\nthe buffaloe.[*]\n\n    [*] In addition to the scientific distinctions which mark the two\n    species, it may be added, with due deference to Dr. Battius, that a\n    much more important particular is the fact, that while the former\n    of these animals is delicious and nourishing food, the latter is\n    scarcely edible.\n\nIt was, therefore, no unusual thing for strangers to encounter each\nother in the endless wastes of the west. By signs, which an unpractised\neye would pass unobserved, these borderers knew when one of his fellows\nwas in his vicinity, and he avoided or approached the intruder as\nbest comported with his feelings or his interests. Generally, these\ninterviews were pacific; for the whites had a common enemy to dread,\nin the ancient and perhaps more lawful occupants of the country; but\ninstances were not rare, in which jealousy and cupidity had caused them\nto terminate in scenes of the most violent and ruthless treachery. The\nmeeting of two hunters on the American desert, as we find it convenient\nsometimes to call this region, was consequently somewhat in the\nsuspicious and wary manner in which two vessels draw together in a\nsea that is known to be infested with pirates. While neither party\nis willing to betray its weakness, by exhibiting distrust, neither is\ndisposed to commit itself by any acts of confidence, from which it may\nbe difficult to recede.\n\nSuch was, in some degree, the character of the present interview. The\nstranger drew nigh deliberately; keeping his eyes steadily fastened\non the movements of the other party, while he purposely created little\ndifficulties to impede an approach which might prove too hasty. On the\nother hand, Paul stood playing with the lock of his rifle, too proud\nto let it appear that three men could manifest any apprehension of\na solitary individual, and yet too prudent to omit, entirely, the\ncustomary precautions. The principal reason of the marked difference\nwhich the two legitimate proprietors of the banquet made in the\nreceptions of their guests, was to be explained by the entire difference\nwhich existed in their respective appearances.\n\nWhile the exterior of the naturalist was decidedly pacific, not to say\nabstracted, that of the new comer was distinguished by an air of vigour,\nand a front and step which it would not have been difficult to have at\nonce pronounced to be military.\n\nHe wore a forage-cap of fine blue cloth, from which depended a soiled\ntassel in gold, and which was nearly buried in a mass of exuberant,\ncurling, jet-black hair. Around his throat he had negligently fastened\na stock of black silk. His body was enveloped in a hunting-shirt of dark\ngreen, trimmed with the yellow fringes and ornaments that were sometimes\nseen among the border-troops of the Confederacy. Beneath this, however,\nwere visible the collar and lapels of a jacket, similar in colour and\ncloth to the cap. His lower limbs were protected by buckskin leggings,\nand his feet by the ordinary Indian moccasins. A richly ornamented,\nand exceedingly dangerous straight dirk was stuck in a sash of red\nsilk net-work; another girdle, or rather belt, of uncoloured leather\ncontained a pair of the smallest sized pistols, in holsters nicely made\nto fit, and across his shoulder was thrown a short, heavy, military\nrifle; its horn and pouch occupying the usual places beneath his arms.\nAt his back he bore a knapsack, marked by the well known initials\nthat have since gained for the government of the United States the\ngood-humoured and quaint appellation of Uncle Sam.\n\n\"I come in amity,\" the stranger said, like one too much accustomed to\nthe sight of arms to be startled at the ludicrously belligerent attitude\nwhich Dr. Battius had seen fit to assume. \"I come as a friend; and am\none whose pursuits and wishes will not at all interfere with your own.\"\n\n\"Harkee, stranger,\" said Paul Hover, bluntly; \"do you understand lining\na bee from this open place into a wood, distant, perhaps, a dozen\nmiles?\"\n\n\"The bee is a bird I have never been compelled to seek,\" returned the\nother, laughing; \"though I have, too, been something of a fowler in my\ntime.\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" exclaimed Paul, thrusting forth his hand frankly,\nand with the true freedom of manner that marks an American borderer.\n\"Let us cross fingers. You and I will never quarrel about the comb,\nsince you set so little store by the honey. And now, if your stomach has\nan empty corner, and you know how to relish a genuine dew-drop when it\nfalls into your very mouth, there lies the exact morsel to put into it.\nTry it, stranger; and having tried it, if you don't call it as snug\na fit as you have made since--How long ar' you from the settlements,\npray?\"\n\n\"'Tis many weeks, and I fear it may be as many more before I can return.\nI will, however, gladly profit by your invitation, for I have fasted\nsince the rising of yesterday's sun, and I know too well the merits of a\nbison's bump to reject the food.\"\n\n\"Ah! you ar' acquainted with the dish! Well, therein you have the\nadvantage of me, in setting out, though I think I may say we could now\nstart on equal ground. I should be the happiest fellow between Kentucky\nand the Rocky Mountains, if I had a snug cabin, near some old wood that\nwas filled with hollow trees, just such a hump every day as that for\ndinner, a load of fresh straw for hives, and little El--\"\n\n\"Little what?\" demanded the stranger, evidently amused with the\ncommunicative and frank disposition of the bee-hunter.\n\n\"Something that I shall have one day, and which concerns nobody so much\nas myself,\" returned Paul, picking the flint of his rifle, and beginning\nvery cavalierly to whistle an air well known on the waters of the\nMississippi.\n\nDuring this preliminary discourse the stranger had taken his seat by the\nside of the hump, and was already making a serious inroad on its relics.\nDr. Battius, however, watched his movements with a jealousy, still more\nstriking than the cordial reception which the open-hearted Paul had just\nexhibited.\n\nBut the doubts, or rather apprehensions, of the naturalist were of a\ncharacter altogether different from the confidence of the bee-hunter. He\nhad been struck with the stranger's using the legitimate, instead of the\nperverted name of the animal off which he was making his repast; and as\nhe had been among the foremost himself to profit by the removal of\nthe impediments which the policy of Spain had placed in the way of all\nexplorers of her trans-Atlantic dominions, whether bent on the purposes\nof commerce, or, like himself, on the more laudable pursuits of science,\nhe had a sufficiency of every-day philosophy to feel that the\nsame motives, which had so powerfully urged himself to his present\nundertaking, might produce a like result on the mind of some other\nstudent of nature. Here, then, was the prospect of an alarming rivalry,\nwhich bade fair to strip him of at least a moiety of the just rewards\nof all his labours, privations, and dangers. Under these views of\nhis character, therefore, it is not at all surprising that the native\nmeekness of the naturalist's disposition was a little disturbed, and\nthat he watched the proceedings of the other with such a degree of\nvigilance as he believed best suited to detect his sinister designs.\n\n\"This is truly a delicious repast,\" observed the unconscious young\nstranger, for both young and handsome he was fairly entitled to be\nconsidered; \"either hunger has given a peculiar relish to the viand, or\nthe bison may lay claim to be the finest of the ox family!\"\n\n\"Naturalists, sir, are apt, when they speak familiarly, to give the\ncow the credit of the genus,\" said Dr. Battius, swelling with secret\ndistrust, and clearing his throat, before speaking, much in the manner\nthat a duellist examines the point of the weapon he is about to plunge\ninto the body of his foe. \"The figure is more perfect; as the bos,\nmeaning the ox, is unable to perpetuate his kind; and the bos, in its\nmost extended meaning, or vacca, is altogether the nobler animal of the\ntwo.\"\n\nThe Doctor uttered this opinion with a certain air, that he intended\nshould express his readiness to come at once, to any of the numerous\npoints of difference which he doubted not existed between them; and he\nnow awaited the blow of his antagonist, intending that his next thrust\nshould be still more vigorous. But the young stranger appeared much\nbetter disposed to partake of the good cheer, with which he had been\nso providentially provided, than to take up the cudgels of argument on\nthis, or on any other of the knotty points which are so apt to furnish\nthe lovers of science with the materials of a mental joust.\n\n\"I dare say you are very right, sir,\" he replied, with a most provoking\nindifference to the importance of the points he conceded. \"I dare say\nyou are quite right; and that vacca would have been the better word.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, sir; you are giving a very wrong construction to my\nlanguage, if you suppose I include, without many and particular\nqualifications, the bibulus Americanus, in the family of the vacca. For,\nas you well know, sir--or, as I presume I should say, Doctor; you have\nthe medical diploma, no doubt?\"\n\n\"You give me credit for an honour I cannot claim,\" interrupted the\nother.\n\n\"An under-graduate!--or perhaps your degrees have been taken in some\nother of the liberal sciences?\"\n\n\"Still wrong, I do assure you.\"\n\n\"Surely, young man, you have not entered on this important--I may say,\nthis awful service, without some evidence of your fitness for the task!\nSome commission by which you can assert an authority to proceed, or by\nwhich you may claim an affinity and a communion with your fellow-workers\nin the same beneficent pursuits!\"\n\n\"I know not by what means, or for what purposes, you have made yourself\nmaster of my objects!\" exclaimed the youth, reddening and rising with a\nquickness which manifested how little he regarded the grosser appetites,\nwhen a subject nearer his heart was approached. \"Still, sir, your\nlanguage is incomprehensible. That pursuit, which in another might\nperhaps be justly called beneficent, is, in me, a dear and cherished\nduty; though why a commission should be demanded or needed is, I\nconfess, no less a subject of surprise.\"\n\n\"It is customary to be provided with such a document,\" returned the\nDoctor, gravely; \"and, on all suitable occasions to produce it, in\norder that congenial and friendly minds may, at once, reject unworthy\nsuspicions, and stepping over, what may be called the elements of\ndiscourse, come at once to those points which are desiderata to both.\"\n\n\"It is a strange request!\" the youth muttered, turning his frowning eye\nfrom one to the other, as if examining the characters of his companions,\nwith a view to weigh their physical powers. Then, putting his hand into\nhis bosom, he drew forth a small box, and extending it with an air of\ndignity towards the Doctor, he continued--\"You will find by this, sir,\nthat I have some right to travel in a country which is now the property\nof the American States.\"\n\n\"What have we here!\" exclaimed the naturalist, opening the folds of\na large parchment. \"Why, this is the sign-manual of the philosopher,\nJefferson! The seal of state! Countersigned by the minister of war!\nWhy this is a commission creating Duncan Uncas Middleton a captain of\nartillery!\"\n\n\"Of whom? of whom?\" repeated the trapper, who had sat regarding the\nstranger, during the whole discourse, with eyes that seemed greedily to\ndevour each lineament. \"How is the name? did you call him Uncas?--Uncas!\nWas it Uncas?\"\n\n\"Such is my name,\" returned the youth, a little haughtily. \"It is the\nappellation of a native chief, that both my uncle and myself bear with\npride; for it is the memorial of an important service done my family by\na warrior in the old wars of the provinces.\"\n\n\"Uncas! did ye call him Uncas?\" repeated the trapper, approaching the\nyouth and parting the dark curls which clustered over his brow, without\nthe slightest resistance on the part of their wondering owner. \"Ah my\neyes are old, and not so keen as when I was a warrior myself; but I can\nsee the look of the father in the son! I saw it when he first came nigh,\nbut so many things have since passed before my failing sight, that I\ncould not name the place where I had met his likeness! Tell me, lad, by\nwhat name is your father known?\"\n\n\"He was an officer of the States in the war of the revolution, of my own\nname of course; my mother's brother was called Duncan Uncas Heyward.\"\n\n\"Still Uncas! still Uncas!\" echoed the other, trembling with eagerness.\n\"And his father?\"\n\n\"Was called the same, without the appellation of the native chief. It\nwas to him, and to my grandmother, that the service of which I have just\nspoken was rendered.\"\n\n\"I know'd it! I know'd it!\" shouted the old man, in his tremulous\nvoice, his rigid features working powerfully, as if the names the other\nmentioned awakened some long dormant emotions, connected with the events\nof an anterior age. \"I know'd it! son or grandson, it is all the same;\nit is the blood, and 'tis the look! Tell me, is he they call'd Duncan,\nwithout the Uncas--is he living?\"\n\nThe young man shook his head sorrowfully, as he replied in the negative.\n\n\"He died full of days and of honours. Beloved, happy, and bestowing\nhappiness!\"\n\n\"Full of days!\" repeated the trapper, looking down at his own meagre,\nbut still muscular hands. \"Ah! he liv'd in the settlements, and was wise\nonly after their fashions. But you have often seen him; and you have\nheard him discourse of Uncas, and of the wilderness?\"\n\n\"Often! he was then an officer of the king; but when the war took place\nbetween the crown and her colonies, my grandfather did not forget his\nbirthplace, but threw off the empty allegiance of names, and was true to\nhis proper country; he fought on the side of liberty.\"\n\n\"There was reason in it; and what is better, there was natur'! Come, sit\nye down beside me, lad; sit ye down, and tell me of what your grand'ther\nused to speak, when his mind dwelt on the wonders of the wilderness.\"\n\nThe youth smiled, no less at the importunity than at the interest\nmanifested by the old man; but as he found there was no longer the\nleast appearance of any violence being contemplated, he unhesitatingly\ncomplied.\n\n\"Give it all to the trapper by rule, and by figures of speech,\" said\nPaul, very coolly taking his seat on the other side of the young\nsoldier. \"It is the fashion of old age to relish these ancient\ntraditions, and, for that matter, I can say that I don't dislike to\nlisten to them myself.\"\n\nMiddleton smiled again, and perhaps with a slight air of derision; but,\ngood-naturedly turning to the trapper, he continued--\n\n\"It is a long, and might prove a painful story. Bloodshed and all the\nhorrors of Indian cruelty and of Indian warfare are fearfully mingled in\nthe narrative.\"\n\n\"Ay, give it all to us, stranger,\" continued Paul; \"we are used to these\nmatters in Kentuck, and, I must say, I think a story none the worse for\nhaving a few scalps in it!\"\n\n\"But he told you of Uncas, did he?\" resumed the trapper, without\nregarding the slight interruptions of the bee-hunter, which amounted to\nno more than a sort of by-play. \"And what thought he and said he of the\nlad, in his parlour, with the comforts and ease of the settlements at\nhis elbow?\"\n\n\"I doubt not he used a language similar to that he would have adopted in\nthe woods, and had he stood face to face, with his friend--\"\n\n\"Did he call the savage his friend; the poor, naked, painted warrior? he\nwas not too proud then to call the Indian his friend?\"\n\n\"He even boasted of the connection; and as you have already heard,\nbestowed a name on his first-born, which is likely to be handed down as\nan heir-loom among the rest of his descendants.\"\n\n\"It was well done! like a man: ay! and like a Christian, too! He used to\nsay the Delaware was swift of foot--did he remember that?\"\n\n\"As the antelope! Indeed, he often spoke of him by the appellation of Le\nCerf Agile, a name he had obtained by his activity.\"\n\n\"And bold, and fearless, lad!\" continued the trapper, looking up into\nthe eyes of his companion, with a wistfulness that bespoke the delight\nhe received in listening to the praises of one, whom it was so very\nevident, he had once tenderly loved.\n\n\"Brave as a blooded hound! Without fear! He always quoted Uncas and his\nfather, who from his wisdom was called the Great Serpent, as models of\nheroism and constancy.\"\n\n\"He did them justice! he did them justice! Truer men were not to be\nfound in tribe or nation, be their skins of what colour they might. I\nsee your grand'ther was just, and did his duty, too, by his offspring!\n'Twas a perilous time he had of it, among them hills, and nobly did\nhe play his own part! Tell me, lad, or officer, I should say,--since\nofficer you be,--was this all?\"\n\n\"Certainly not; it was, as I have said, a fearful tale, full of\nmoving incidents, and the memories both of my grandfather and of my\ngrandmother--\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the trapper, tossing a hand into the air as his whole\ncountenance lighted with the recollections the name revived. \"They\ncalled her Alice! Elsie or Alice; 'tis all the same. A laughing, playful\nchild she was, when happy; and tender and weeping in her misery! Her\nhair was shining and yellow, as the coat of the young fawn, and her\nskin clearer than the purest water that drips from the rock. Well do I\nremember her! I remember her right well!\"\n\nThe lip of the youth slightly curled, and he regarded the old man with\nan expression, which might easily have been construed into a declaration\nthat such were not his own recollections of his venerable and revered\nancestor, though it would seem he did not think it necessary to say as\nmuch in words. He was content to answer--\n\n\"They both retained impressions of the dangers they had passed, by\nfar too vivid easily to lose the recollection of any of their\nfellow-actors.\"\n\nThe trapper looked aside, and seemed to struggle with some deeply innate\nfeeling; then, turning again towards his companion, though his honest\neyes no longer dwelt with the same open interest, as before, on the\ncountenance of the other, he continued--\n\n\"Did he tell you of them all? Were they all red-skins, but himself and\nthe daughters of Munro?\"\n\n\"No. There was a white man associated with the Delawares. A scout of the\nEnglish army, but a native of the provinces.\"\n\n\"A drunken worthless vagabond, like most of his colour who harbour with\nthe savages, I warrant you!\"\n\n\"Old man, your grey hairs should caution you against slander. The man I\nspeak of was of great simplicity of mind, but of sterling worth. Unlike\nmost of those who live a border life, he united the better, instead of\nthe worst, qualities of the two people. He was a man endowed with the\nchoicest and perhaps rarest gift of nature; that of distinguishing good\nfrom evil. His virtues were those of simplicity, because such were the\nfruits of his habits, as were indeed his very prejudices. In courage\nhe was the equal of his red associates; in warlike skill, being better\ninstructed, their superior. 'In short, he was a noble shoot from the\nstock of human nature, which never could attain its proper elevation and\nimportance, for no other reason, than because it grew in the forest:'\nsuch, old hunter, were the very words of my grandfather, when speaking\nof the man you imagine so worthless!\"\n\nThe eyes of the trapper had sunk to the earth, as the stranger delivered\nthis character in the ardent tones of generous youth. He played with the\nears of his hound; fingered his own rustic garment, and opened and shut\nthe pan of his rifle, with hands that trembled in a manner that would\nhave implied their total unfitness to wield the weapon. When the other\nhad concluded, he hoarsely added--\n\n\"Your grand'ther didn't then entirely forget the white man!\"\n\n\"So far from that, there are already three among us, who have also names\nderived from that scout.\"\n\n\"A name, did you say?\" exclaimed the old man, starting; \"what, the name\nof the solitary, unl'arned hunter? Do the great, and the rich, and the\nhonoured, and, what is better still, the just, do they bear his very,\nactual name?\"\n\n\"It is borne by my brother, and by two of my cousins, whatever may be\ntheir titles to be described by the terms you have mentioned.\"\n\n\"Do you mean the actual name itself; spelt with the very same letters,\nbeginning with an N and ending with an L?\"\n\n\"Exactly the same,\" the youth smilingly replied. \"No, no, we have\nforgotten nothing that was his. I have at this moment a dog brushing a\ndeer, not far from this, who is come of a hound that very scout sent as\na present after his friends, and which was of the stock he always used\nhimself: a truer breed, in nose and foot, is not to be found in the wide\nUnion.\"\n\n\"Hector!\" said the old man, struggling to conquer an emotion that nearly\nsuffocated him, and speaking to his hound in the sort of tones he would\nhave used to a child, \"do ye hear that, pup! your kin and blood are in\nthe prairies! A name--it is wonderful--very wonderful!\"\n\nNature could endure no more. Overcome by a flood of unusual and\nextraordinary sensations, and stimulated by tender and long dormant\nrecollections, strangely and unexpectedly revived, the old man had just\nself-command enough to add, in a voice that was hollow and unnatural,\nthrough the efforts he made to command it--\n\n\"Boy, I am that scout; a warrior once, a miserable trapper now!\" when\nthe tears broke over his wasted cheeks, out of fountains that had long\nbeen dried, and, sinking his face between his knees, he covered it\ndecently with his buckskin garment, and sobbed aloud.\n\nThe spectacle produced correspondent emotions in his companions. Paul\nHover had actually swallowed each syllable of the discourse as they fell\nalternately from the different speakers, his feelings keeping equal\npace with the increasing interest of the scene. Unused to such strange\nsensations, he was turning his face on every side of him, to avoid he\nknew not what, until he saw the tears and heard the sobs of the old\nman, when he sprang to his feet, and grappling his guest fiercely by\nthe throat, he demanded by what authority he had made his aged companion\nweep. A flash of recollection crossing his brain at the same instant, he\nreleased his hold, and stretching forth an arm in the very wantonness\nof gratification, he seized the Doctor by the hair, which instantly\nrevealed its artificial formation, by cleaving to his hand, leaving the\nwhite and shining poll of the naturalist with a covering no warmer than\nthe skin.\n\n\"What think you of that, Mr. Bug-gatherer?\" he rather shouted than\ncried: \"is not this a strange bee to line into his hole?\"\n\n\"'Tis remarkable! wonderful! edifying!\" returned the lover of nature,\ngood-humouredly recovering his wig, with twinkling eyes and a husky\nvoice. \"'Tis rare and commendable. Though I doubt not in the exact order\nof causes and effects.\"\n\nWith this sudden outbreaking, however, the commotion instantly subsided;\nthe three spectators clustering around the trapper with a species of\nawe, at beholding the tears of one so aged.\n\n\"It must be so, or how could he be so familiar with a history that is\nlittle known beyond my own family,\" at length the youth observed, not\nashamed to acknowledge how much he had been affected, by unequivocally\ndrying his own eyes.\n\n\"True!\" echoed Paul; \"if you want any more evidence I will swear to it!\nI know every word of it myself to be true as the gospel!\"\n\n\"And yet we had long supposed him dead!\" continued the soldier. \"My\ngrandfather had filled his days with honour, and he had believed himself\nthe junior of the two.\"\n\n\"It is not often that youth has an opportunity of thus looking down\non the weakness of age!\" the trapper observed, raising his head, and\nlooking around him with composure and dignity. \"That I am still here,\nyoung man, is the pleasure of the Lord, who has spared me until I have\nseen fourscore long and laborious years, for his own secret ends. That\nI am the man I say, you need not doubt; for why should I go to my grave\nwith so cheap a lie in my mouth?\"\n\n\"I do not hesitate to believe; I only marvel that it should be so! But\nwhy do I find you, venerable and excellent friend of my parents, in\nthese wastes, so far from the comforts and safety of the lower country?\"\n\n\"I have come into these plains to escape the sound of the axe; for here\nsurely the chopper can never follow! But I may put the like question to\nyourself. Are you of the party which the States have sent into their new\npurchase, to look after the natur' of the bargain they have made?\"\n\n\"I am not. Lewis is making his way up the river, some hundreds of miles\nfrom this. I come on a private adventure.\"\n\n\"Though it is no cause of wonder, that a man whose strength and eyes\nhave failed him as a hunter, should be seen nigh the haunts of the\nbeaver, using a trap instead of a rifle, it is strange that one so young\nand prosperous, and bearing the commission of the Great Father, should\nbe moving among the prairies, without even a camp-colourman to do his\nbiddings!\"\n\n\"You would think my reasons sufficient did you know them, as know them\nyou shall if you are disposed to listen to my story. I think you all\nhonest, and men who would rather aid than betray one bent on a worthy\nobject.\"\n\n\"Come, then, and tell us at your leisure,\" said the trapper, seating\nhimself, and beckoning to the youth to follow his example. The latter\nwillingly complied; and after Paul and the Doctor had disposed of\nthemselves to their several likings, the new comer entered into a\nnarrative of the singular reasons which had led him so far into the\ndeserts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n              So foul a sky clears not without a storm.\n                                                    --King John.\n\nIn the mean time the industrious and irreclaimable hours continued\ntheir labours. The sun, which had been struggling through such masses\nof vapour throughout the day, fell slowly in a streak of clear sky, and\nthence sunk gloriously into the gloomy wastes, as he is wont to settle\ninto the waters of the ocean. The vast herds which had been grazing\namong the wild pastures of the prairies, gradually disappeared, and\nthe endless flocks of aquatic birds, that were pursuing their customary\nannual journey from the virgin lakes of the north towards the gulf of\nMexico, ceased to fan that air, which had now become loaded with dew and\nvapour. In short, the shadows of night fell upon the rock, adding the\nmantle of darkness to the other dreary accompaniments of the place.\n\nAs the light began to fail, Esther collected her younger children at\nher side, and placing herself on a projecting point of her insulated\nfortress, she sat patiently awaiting the return of the hunters. Ellen\nWade was at no great distance, seeming to keep a little aloof from the\nanxious circle, as if willing to mark the distinction which existed in\ntheir characters.\n\n\"Your uncle is, and always will be, a dull calculator, Nell,\" observed\nthe mother, after a long pause in a conversation that had turned on the\nlabours of the day; \"a lazy hand at figures and foreknowledge is that\nsaid Ishmael Bush! Here he sat lolloping about the rock from light till\nnoon, doing nothing but scheme--scheme--scheme--with seven as noble boys\nat his elbows as woman ever gave to man; and what's the upshot? why,\nnight is setting in, and his needful work not yet ended.\"\n\n\"It is not prudent, certainly, aunt,\" Ellen replied, with a vacancy in\nher air, that proved how little she knew what she was saying; \"and it is\nsetting a very bad example to his sons.\"\n\n\"Hoity, toity, girl! who has reared you up as a judge over your elders,\nay, and your betters, too! I should like to see the man on the whole\nfrontier, who sets a more honest example to his children than this\nsame Ishmael Bush! Show me, if you can, Miss Fault-finder, but not\nfault-mender, a set of boys who will, on occasion, sooner chop a piece\nof logging and dress it for the crop, than my own children; though I\nsay it myself, who, perhaps, should be silent; or a cradler that knows\nbetter how to lead a gang of hands through a field of wheat, leaving a\ncleaner stubble in his track, than my own good man! Then, as a father,\nhe is as generous as a lord; for his sons have only to name the\nspot where they would like to pitch, and he gives 'em a deed of the\nplantation, and no charge for papers is ever made!\"\n\nAs the wife of the squatter concluded, she raised a hollow, taunting\nlaugh, that was echoed from the mouths of several juvenile imitators,\nwhom she was training to a life as shiftless and lawless as her own;\nbut which, notwithstanding its uncertainty, was not without its secret\ncharms.\n\n\"Holloa! old Eester;\" shouted the well-known voice of her husband, from\nthe plain beneath; \"ar' you keeping your junkets, while we are finding\nyou in venison and buffaloe beef? Come down--come down, old girl, with\nall your young; and lend us a hand to carry up the meat;--why, what\na frolic you ar' in, woman! Come down, come down, for the boys are at\nhand, and we have work here for double your number.\"\n\nIshmael might have spared his lungs more than a moiety of the effort\nthey were compelled to make in order that he should be heard. He had\nhardly uttered the name of his wife, before the whole of the crouching\ncircle rose in a body, and tumbling over each other, they precipitated\nthemselves down the dangerous passes of the rock with ungovernable\nimpatience. Esther followed the young fry with a more measured gait;\nnor did Ellen deem it wise, or rather discreet, to remain behind.\nConsequently, the whole were soon assembled at the base of the citadel,\non the open plain.\n\nHere the squatter was found, staggering under the weight of a fine\nfat buck, attended by one or two of his younger sons. Abiram quickly\nappeared, and before many minutes had elapsed, most of the hunters\ndropped in, singly and in pairs, each man bringing with him some fruits\nof his prowess in the field.\n\n\"The plain is free from red-skins, to-night at least,\" said Ishmael,\nafter the bustle of reception had a little subsided; \"for I have scoured\nthe prairie for many long miles, on my own feet, and I call myself a\njudge of the print of an Indian moccasin. So, old woman, you can give us\na few steaks of the venison, and then we will sleep on the day's work.\"\n\n\"I'll not swear there are no savages near us,\" said Abiram. \"I, too,\nknow something of the trail of a red-skin; and, unless my eyes have lost\nsome of their sight, I would swear, boldly, that there ar' Indians at\nhand. But wait till Asa comes in. He pass'd the spot where I found the\nmarks, and the boy knows something of such matters too.\"\n\n\"Ay, the boy knows too much of many things,\" returned Ishmael, gloomily.\n\"It will be better for him when he thinks he knows less. But what\nmatters it, Hetty, if all the Sioux tribes, west of the big river, are\nwithin a mile of us; they will find it no easy matter to scale this\nrock, in the teeth of ten bold men.\"\n\n\"Call 'em twelve at once, Ishmael; call 'em twelve!\" cried his termagant\nassistant. \"For if your moth-gathering, bug-hunting friend, can be\ncounted a man, I beg you will set me down as two. I will not turn my\nback to him, with the rifle or the shot-gun; and for courage!--the\nyearling heifer, that them skulking devils the Tetons stole, was the\nbiggest coward among us all, and after her came your drivelling Doctor.\nAh! Ishmael, you rarely attempt a regular trade but you come out the\nloser; and this man, I reckon, is the hardest bargain among them all!\nWould you think it, the fellow ordered me a blister around my mouth,\nbecause I complained of a pain in the foot?\"\n\n\"It is a pity, Eester,\" the husband coolly answered, \"that you did not\ntake it; I reckon it would have done considerable good. But, boys, if it\nshould turn out as Abiram thinks, that there are Indians near us, we may\nhave to scamper up the rock, and lose our suppers after all; therefore\nwe will make sure of the game, and talk over the performances of the\nDoctor when we have nothing better to do.\"\n\nThe hint was taken; and in a few minutes, the exposed situation in which\nthe family was collected, was exchanged for the more secure elevation\nof the rock. Here Esther busied herself, working and scolding with equal\nindustry, until the repast was prepared; when she summoned her husband\nto his meal in a voice as sonorous as that with which the Imam reminds\nthe Faithful of a more important duty.\n\nWhen each had assumed his proper and customary place around the smoking\nviands, the squatter set the example by beginning to partake of a\ndelicious venison steak, prepared like the hump of the bison, with a\nskill that rather increased than concealed its natural properties. A\npainter would gladly have seized the moment, to transfer the wild and\ncharacteristic scene to the canvass.\n\nThe reader will remember that the citadel of Ishmael stood insulated,\nlofty, ragged, and nearly inaccessible. A bright flashing fire that was\nburning on the centre of its summit, and around which the busy group\nwas clustered, lent it the appearance of some tall Pharos placed in the\ncentre of the deserts, to light such adventurers as wandered through\ntheir broad wastes. The flashing flame gleamed from one sun-burnt\ncountenance to another, exhibiting every variety of expression, from the\njuvenile simplicity of the children, mingled as it was with a shade of\nthe wildness peculiar to their semi-barbarous lives, to the dull and\nimmovable apathy that dwelt on the features of the squatter, when\nunexcited. Occasionally a gust of wind would fan the embers; and, as\na brighter light shot upwards, the little solitary tent was seen as it\nwere suspended in the gloom of the upper air. All beyond was enveloped,\nas usual at that hour, in an impenetrable body of darkness.\n\n\"It is unaccountable that Asa should choose to be out of the way at such\na time as this,\" Esther pettishly observed. \"When all is finished and\nto rights, we shall have the boy coming up, grumbling for his meal, and\nhungry as a bear after his winter's nap. His stomach is as true as the\nbest clock in Kentucky, and seldom wants winding up to tell the time,\nwhether of day or night. A desperate eater is Asa, when a-hungered by a\nlittle work!\"\n\nIshmael looked sternly around the circle of his silent sons, as if to\nsee whether any among them would presume to say aught in favour of the\nabsent delinquent. But now, when no exciting causes existed to arouse\ntheir slumbering tempers, it seemed to be too great an effort to enter\non the defence of their rebellious brother. Abiram, however, who, since\nthe pacification, either felt, or affected to feel, a more generous\ninterest in his late adversary, saw fit to express an anxiety, to which\nthe others were strangers--\n\n\"It will be well if the boy has escaped the Tetons!\" he muttered. \"I\nshould be sorry to have Asa, who is one of the stoutest of our party,\nboth in heart and hand, fall into the power of the red devils.\"\n\n\"Look to yourself, Abiram; and spare your breath, if you can use it only\nto frighten the woman and her huddling girls. You have whitened the face\nof Ellen Wade, already; who looks as pale as if she was staring to-day\nat the very Indians you name, when I was forced to speak to her through\nthe rifle, because I couldn't reach her ears with my tongue. How was it,\nNell! you have never given the reason of your deafness?\"\n\nThe colour of Ellen's cheek changed as suddenly as the squatter's\npiece had flashed on the occasion to which he alluded, the burning glow\nsuffusing her features, until it even mantled her throat with its fine\nhealthful tinge. She hung her head abashed, but did not seem to think it\nnecessary to reply.\n\nIshmael, too sluggish to pursue the subject, or content with the\npointed allusion he had just made, rose from his seat on the rock,\nand stretching his heavy frame, like a well-fed and fattened ox, he\nannounced his intention to sleep. Among a race who lived chiefly for the\nindulgence of the natural wants, such a declaration could not fail of\nmeeting with sympathetic dispositions. One after another disappeared,\neach seeking his or her rude dormitory; and, before many minutes,\nEsther, who by this time had scolded the younger fry to sleep, found\nherself, if we except the usual watchman below, in solitary possession\nof the naked rock.\n\nWhatever less valuable fruits had been produced in this uneducated woman\nby her migratory habits, the great principle of female nature was too\ndeeply rooted ever to be entirely eradicated. Of a powerful, not to\nsay fierce temperament, her passions were violent and difficult to\nbe smothered. But, however she might and did abuse the accidental\nprerogatives of her situation, love for her offspring, while it often\nslumbered, could never be said to become extinct. She liked not the\nprotracted absence of Asa. Too fearless herself to have hesitated an\ninstant on her own account about crossing the dark abyss, into which she\nnow sat looking with longing eyes, her busy imagination, in obedience\nto this inextinguishable sentiment, began to conjure nameless evils on\naccount of her son. It might be true, as Abiram had hinted, that he had\nbecome a captive to some of the tribes who were hunting the buffaloe\nin that vicinity, or even a still more dreadful calamity might have\nbefallen. So thought the mother, while silence and darkness lent their\naid to the secret impulses of nature.\n\nAgitated by these reflections, which put sleep at defiance, Esther\ncontinued at her post, listening with that sort of acuteness which is\ntermed instinct in the animals a few degrees below her in the scale of\nintelligence, for any of those noises which might indicate the approach\nof footsteps. At length, her wishes had an appearance of being realised,\nfor the long desired sounds were distinctly audible, and presently she\ndistinguished the dim form of a man at the base of the rock.\n\n\"Now, Asa, richly do you deserve to be left with an earthen bed this\nblessed night!\" the woman began to mutter, with a revolution in her\nfeelings, that will not be surprising to those who have made the\ncontradictions that give variety to the human character a study. \"And\na hard one I've a mind it shall be! Why Abner; Abner; you Abner, do you\nsleep? Let me not see you dare to open the hole, till I get down. I will\nknow who it is that wishes to disturb a peaceable, ay, and an honest\nfamily too, at such a time in the night as this!\"\n\n\"Woman!\" exclaimed a voice, that intended to bluster, while the speaker\nwas manifestly a little apprehensive of the consequences; \"Woman, I\nforbid you on pain of the law to project any of your infernal missiles.\nI am a citizen, and a freeholder, and a graduate of two universities;\nand I stand upon my rights! Beware of malice prepense, of chance-medley,\nand of manslaughter. It is I--your amicus; a friend and inmate. I--Dr.\nObed Battius.\"\n\n\"Who?\" demanded Esther, in a voice that nearly refused to convey her\nwords to the ears of the anxious listener beneath. \"Did you say it was\nnot Asa?\"\n\n\"Nay, I am neither Asa, nor Absalom, nor any of the Hebrew princes, but\nObed, the root and stock of them all. Have I not said, woman, that you\nkeep one in attendance who is entitled to a peaceable as well as\nan honourable admission? Do you take me for an animal of the class\namphibia, and that I can play with my lungs as a blacksmith does with\nhis bellows?\"\n\nThe naturalist might have expended his breath much longer, without\nproducing any desirable result, had Esther been his only auditor.\nDisappointed and alarmed, the woman had already sought her pallet, and\nwas preparing, with a sort of desperate indifference, to compose herself\nto sleep. Abner, the sentinel below, however, had been aroused from\nan exceedingly equivocal situation by the outcry; and as he had\nnow regained sufficient consciousness to recognise the voice of the\nphysician, the latter was admitted with the least possible delay. Dr.\nBattius bustled through the narrow entrance, with an air of singular\nimpatience, and was already beginning to mount the difficult ascent,\nwhen catching a view of the porter, he paused, to observe with an air\nthat he intended should be impressively admonitory--\n\n\"Abner, there are dangerous symptoms of somnolency about thee! It\nis sufficiently exhibited in the tendency to hiation, and may prove\ndangerous not only to yourself, but to all thy father's family.\"\n\n\"You never made a greater mistake, Doctor,\" returned the youth, gaping\nlike an indolent lion; \"I haven't a symptom, as you call it, about any\npart of me; and as to father and the children, I reckon the small-pox\nand the measles have been thoroughly through the breed these many months\nago.\"\n\nContent with his brief admonition, the naturalist had surmounted half\nthe difficulties of the ascent before the deliberate Abner ended his\njustification. On the summit, Obed fully expected to encounter Esther,\nof whose linguacious powers he had too often been furnished with the\nmost sinister reproofs, and of which he stood in an awe too salutary to\ncovet a repetition of the attacks. The reader can foresee that he was\nto be agreeably disappointed. Treading lightly, and looking timidly\nover his shoulder, as if he apprehended a shower of something, even more\nformidable than words, the Doctor proceeded to the place which had been\nallotted to himself in the general disposition of the dormitories.\n\nInstead of sleeping, the worthy naturalist sat ruminating over what he\nhad both seen and heard that day, until the tossing and mutterings\nwhich proceeded from the cabin of Esther, who was his nearest neighbour,\nadvertised him of the wakeful situation of its inmate. Perceiving the\nnecessity of doing something to disarm this female Cerberus, before his\nown purpose could be accomplished, the Doctor, reluctant as he was to\nencounter her tongue, found himself compelled to invite a colloquial\ncommunication.\n\n\"You appear not to sleep, my very kind and worthy Mrs. Bush,\" he said,\ndetermined to commence his applications with a plaster that was usually\nfound to adhere; \"you appear to rest badly, my excellent hostess; can I\nadminister to your ailings?\"\n\n\"What would you give me, man?\" grumbled Esther; \"a blister to make me\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Say rather a cataplasm. But if you are in pain, here are some cordial\ndrops, which, taken in a glass of my own cogniac, will give you rest, if\nI know aught of the materia medica.\"\n\nThe Doctor, as he very well knew, had assailed Esther on her weak side;\nand, as he doubted not of the acceptable quality of his prescription, he\nsat himself at work, without unnecessary delay, to prepare it. When he\nmade his offering, it was received in a snappish and threatening manner,\nbut swallowed with a facility that sufficiently proclaimed how much it\nwas relished. The woman muttered her thanks, and her leech reseated\nhimself in silence, to await the operation of the dose. In less than\nhalf an hour the breathing of Esther became so profound, and, as the\nDoctor himself might have termed it, so very abstracted, that had he not\nknown how easy it was to ascribe this new instance of somnolency to the\npowerful dose of opium with which he had garnished the brandy, he might\nhave seen reason to distrust his own prescription. With the sleep of the\nrestless woman, the stillness became profound and general.\n\nThen Dr. Battius saw fit to arise, with the silence and caution of the\nmidnight robber, and to steal out of his own cabin, or rather kennel,\nfor it deserved no better name, towards the adjoining dormitories. Here\nhe took time to assure himself that all his neighbours were buried in\ndeep sleep. Once advised of this important fact, he hesitated no longer,\nbut commenced the difficult ascent which led to the upper pinnacle\nof the rock. His advance, though abundantly guarded, was not entirely\nnoiseless; but while he was felicitating himself on having successfully\neffected his object, and he was in the very act of placing his foot on\nthe highest ledge a hand was laid upon the skirts of his coat, which as\neffectually put an end to his advance, as if the gigantic strength of\nIshmael himself had pinned him to the earth.\n\n\"Is there sickness in the tent,\" whispered a soft voice in his very ear,\n\"that Dr. Battius is called to visit it at such an hour?\"\n\nSo soon as the heart of the naturalist had returned from its hasty\nexpedition into his throat, as one less skilled than Dr. Battius in the\nformation of the animal would have been apt to have accounted for\nthe extraordinary sensation with which he received this unlooked-for\ninterruption, he found resolution to reply; using, as much in terror as\nin prudence, the same precaution in the indulgence of his voice.\n\n\"My worthy Nelly! I am greatly rejoiced to find it is no other than\nthee. Hist! child, hist! Should Ishmael gain a knowledge of our plans,\nhe would not hesitate to cast us both from this rock, upon the plain\nbeneath. Hist! Nelly, hist!\"\n\nAs the Doctor delivered his injunctions between the intervals of his\nascent, by the time they were concluded, both he and his auditor had\ngained the upper level.\n\n\"And now, Dr. Battius,\" the girl gravely demanded, \"may I know the\nreason why you have run so great a risk of flying from this place,\nwithout wings, and at the certain expense of your neck?\"\n\n\"Nothing shall be concealed from thee, worthy and trusty Nelly--but are\nyou certain that Ishmael will not awake?\"\n\n\"No fear of him; he will sleep until the sun scorches his eyelids. The\ndanger is from my aunt.\"\n\n\"Esther sleepeth!\" the Doctor sententiously replied. \"Ellen, you have\nbeen watching on this rock, to-day?\"\n\n\"I was ordered to do so.\"\n\n\"And you have seen the bison, and the antelope, and the wolf, and the\ndeer, as usual; animals of the orders, pecora, belluae, and ferae.\"\n\n\"I have seen the creatures you named in English, but I know nothing of\nthe Indian languages.\"\n\n\"There is still an order that I have not named, which you have also\nseen. The primates--is it not true?\"\n\n\"I cannot say. I know no animal by that name.\"\n\n\"Nay, Ellen, you confer with a friend. Of the genus, homo, child?\"\n\n\"Whatever else I may have had in view, I have not seen the vespertilio\nhorribi--\"\n\n\"Hush, Nelly, thy vivacity will betray us! Tell me, girl, have you not\nseen certain bipeds, called men, wandering about the prairies?\"\n\n\"Surely. My uncle and his sons have been hunting the buffaloe, since the\nsun began to fall.\"\n\n\"I must speak in the vernacular, to be comprehended. Ellen, I would say\nof the species, Kentucky.\"\n\nThough Ellen reddened like the rose, her blushes were concealed by the\ndarkness. She hesitated an instant, and then summoned sufficient spirit\nto say, decidedly--\n\n\"If you wish to speak in parables, Doctor Battius, you must find another\nlistener. Put your questions plainly in English, and I will answer them\nhonestly in the same tongue.\"\n\n\"I have been journeying in this desert, as thou knowest, Nelly, in quest\nof animals that have been hidden from the eyes of science, until now.\nAmong others, I have discovered a primates, of the genus, homo; species,\nKentucky; which I term, Paul--\"\n\n\"Hist, for the sake of mercy!\" said Ellen; \"speak lower, Doctor, or we\nshall be ruined.\"\n\n\"Hover; by profession a collector of the apes, or bee,\" continued the\nother. \"Do I use the vernacular now,--am I understood?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, perfectly,\" returned the girl, breathing with difficulty, in\nher surprise. \"But what of him? did he tell you to mount this rock?--he\nknows nothing, himself; for the oath I gave my uncle has shut my mouth.\"\n\n\"Ay, but there is one that has taken no oath, who has revealed all. I\nwould that the mantle which is wrapped around the mysteries of nature,\nwere as effectually withdrawn from its hidden treasures! Ellen! Ellen!\nthe man with whom I have unwittingly formed a compactum, or agreement,\nis sadly forgetful of the obligations of honesty! Thy uncle, child.\"\n\n\"You mean Ishmael Bush, my father's brother's widow's husband,\" returned\nthe offended girl, a little proudly.--\"Indeed, indeed, it is cruel to\nreproach me with a tie that chance has formed, and which I would rejoice\nso much to break for ever!\"\n\nThe humbled Ellen could utter no more, but sinking on a projection of\nthe rock, she began to sob in a manner that rendered their situation\ndoubly critical. The Doctor muttered a few words, which he intended\nas an apologetic explanation, but before he had time to complete his\nlaboured vindication, she arose and said with decision--\n\n\"I did not come here to pass my time in foolish tears, nor you to try to\nstop them. What then has brought you hither?\"\n\n\"I must see the inmate of that tent.\"\n\n\"You know what it contains?\"\n\n\"I am taught to believe I do; and I bear a letter, which I must deliver\nwith my own hands. If the animal prove a quadruped, Ishmael is a true\nman--if a biped, fledged or unfledged, I care not, he is false, and our\ncompactum at an end!\"\n\nEllen made a sign for the Doctor to remain where he was, and to be\nsilent. She then glided into the tent, where she continued many minutes,\nthat proved exceedingly weary and anxious to the expectant without, but\nthe instant she returned, she took him by the arm, and together they\nentered beneath the folds of the mysterious cloth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n              Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!\n                                                --King Henry VI.\n\nThe mustering of the borderers on the following morning was silent,\nsullen, and gloomy. The repast of that hour was wanting in the\ninharmonious accompaniment with which Esther ordinarily enlivened\ntheir meals; for the effects of the powerful opiate the Doctor had\nadministered still muddled her intellects. The young men brooded over\nthe absence of their elder brother, and the brows of Ishmael himself\nwere knit, as he cast his scowling eyes from one to the other, like a\nman preparing to meet and to repel an expected assault on his\nauthority. In the midst of this family distrust, Ellen and her midnight\nconfederate, the naturalist, took their usual places among the children,\nwithout awakening suspicion or exciting comment. The only apparent\nfruits of the adventure in which they had been engaged, were occasional\nupliftings of the eyes, on the part of the Doctor, which were mistaken\nby the observers for some of his scientific contemplations of the\nheavens, but which, in reality, were no other than furtive glances at\nthe fluttering walls of the proscribed tent.\n\nAt length the squatter, who had waited in vain for some more decided\nmanifestation of the expected rising among his sons, resolved to make a\ndemonstration of his own intentions.\n\n\"Asa shall account to me for this undutiful conduct!\" he observed. \"Here\nhas the livelong night gone by, and he out-lying on the prairie, when\nhis hand and his rifle might both have been wanted in a brush with the\nSiouxes, for any right he had to know the contrary.\"\n\n\"Spare your breath, good man,\" retorted his wife; \"be saving of your\nbreath; for you may have to call long enough for the boy before he will\nanswer!\"\n\n\"It ar' a fact, that some men be so womanish, as to let the young master\nthe old! But, you, old Esther, should know better than to think such\nwill ever be the nature of things in the family of Ishmael Bush.\"\n\n\"Ah! you are a hectorer with the boys, when need calls! I know it well,\nIshmael; and one of your sons have you driven from you, by your temper;\nand that, too, at a time when he is most wanted.\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Abner, whose sluggish nature had gradually been\nstimulating itself to the exertion of taking so bold a stand, \"the boys\nand I have pretty generally concluded to go out on the search of Asa. We\nare disagreeable about his camping on the prairie, instead of coming in\nto his own bed, as we all know he would like to do.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" muttered Abiram; \"the boy has killed a buck; or perhaps a\nbuffaloe; and he is sleeping by the carcass to keep off the wolves, till\nday; we shall soon see him, or hear him bawling for help to bring in his\nload.\"\n\n\"'Tis little help that a son of mine will call for, to shoulder a buck\nor to quarter your wild-beef,\" returned the mother. \"And you, Abiram, to\nsay so uncertain a thing! you, who said yourself that the red-skins had\nbeen prowling around this place, no later than the yesterday--\"\n\n\"I!\" exclaimed her brother, hastily, as if anxious to retract an error;\n\"I said it then, and I say it now and so you will find it to be. The\nTetons are in our neighbourhood, and happy will it prove for the boy if\nhe is well shut of them.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Dr. Battius, speaking with the sort of\ndeliberation and dignity one is apt to use after having thoroughly\nripened his opinions by sufficient reflection,--\"it seems to me, a man\nbut little skilled in the signs and tokens of Indian warfare, especially\nas practised in these remote plains, but one, who I may say without\nvanity has some insight into the mysteries of nature,--it seems, then,\nto me, thus humbly qualified, that when doubts exist in a matter of\nmoment, it would always be the wisest course to appease them.\"\n\n\"No more of your doctoring for me!\" cried the grum Esther; \"no more of\nyour quiddities in a healthy family, say I! Here was I doing well, only\na little out of sorts with over instructing the young, and you dos'd\nme with a drug that hangs about my tongue, like a pound weight on a\nhumming-bird's wing!\"\n\n\"Is the medicine out?\" drily demanded Ishmael: \"it must be a rare dose\nthat gives a heavy feel to the tongue of old Eester!\"\n\n\"Friend,\" continued the Doctor, waving his hand for the angry wife to\nmaintain the peace, \"that it cannot perform all that is said of it, the\nvery charge of good Mrs. Bush is a sufficient proof. But to speak of the\nabsent Asa. There is doubt as to his fate, and there is a proposition\nto solve it. Now, in the natural sciences truth is always a desideratum;\nand I confess it would seem to be equally so in the present case of\ndomestic uncertainty, which may be called a vacuum where according to\nthe laws of physic, there should exist some pretty palpable proofs of\nmateriality.\"\n\n\"Don't mind him, don't mind him,\" cried Esther, observing that the rest\nof his auditors listened with an attention which might proceed, equally,\nfrom acquiescence in his proposal or ignorance of its meaning. \"There is\na drug in every word he utters.\"\n\n\"Dr. Battius wishes to say,\" Ellen modestly interposed, \"that as some\nof us think Asa is in danger, and some think otherwise, the whole family\nmight pass an hour or two in looking for him.\"\n\n\"Does he?\" interrupted the woman; \"then Dr. Battius has more sense in\nhim than I believed! She is right, Ishmael; and what she says, shall be\ndone. I will shoulder a rifle myself; and woe betide the red-skin that\ncrosses my path! I have pulled a trigger before to-day; ay, and heard an\nIndian yell, too, to my sorrow.\"\n\nThe spirit of Esther diffused itself, like the stimulus which attends\na war-cry, among her sons. They arose in a body, and declared their\ndetermination to second so bold a resolution. Ishmael prudently yielded\nto an impulse he could not resist, and in a few minutes the woman\nappeared, shouldering her arms, prepared to lead forth, in person, such\nof her descendants as chose to follow.\n\n\"Let them stay with the children that please,\" she said, \"and them\nfollow me, who ar' not chicken-hearted!\"\n\n\"Abiram, it will not do to leave the huts without some guard,\" Ishmael\nwhispered, glancing his eye upward.\n\nThe man whom he addressed started, and betrayed extraordinary eagerness\nin his reply.\n\n\"I will tarry and watch the camp.\"\n\nA dozen voices were instantly raised in objections to this proposal.\nHe was wanted to point out the places where the hostile tracks had been\nseen, and his termagant sister openly scouted at the idea, as unworthy\nof his manhood. The reluctant Abiram was compelled to yield, and Ishmael\nmade a new disposition for the defence of the place; which was admitted,\nby every one, to be all-important to their security and comfort.\n\nHe offered the post of commandant to Dr. Battius, who, however,\nperemptorily and somewhat haughtily declined the doubtful honour;\nexchanging looks of intelligence with Ellen, as he did so. In this\ndilemma the squatter was obliged to constitute the girl herself\ncastellan; taking care, however, in deputing this important trust, to\nomit no words of caution and instruction. When this preliminary point\nwas settled, the young men proceeded to arrange certain means of\ndefence, and signals of alarm, that were adapted to the weakness and\ncharacter of the garrison. Several masses of rock were drawn to the edge\nof the upper level, and so placed as to leave it at the discretion of\nthe feeble Ellen and her associates, to cast them or not, as they\nmight choose, on the heads of any invaders, who would, of necessity,\nbe obliged to mount the eminence by the difficult and narrow passage\nalready so often mentioned. In addition to this formidable obstruction,\nthe barriers were strengthened and rendered nearly impassable. Smaller\nmissiles, that might be hurled even by the hands of the younger\nchildren, but which would prove, from the elevation of the place,\nexceedingly dangerous, were provided in profusion. A pile of dried\nleaves and splinters were placed, as a beacon, on the upper rock, and\nthen, even in the jealous judgment of the squatter, the post was deemed\ncompetent to maintain a creditable siege.\n\nThe moment the rock was thought to be in a state of sufficient security,\nthe party who composed what might be called the sortie, sallied forth on\ntheir anxious expedition. The advance was led by Esther in person, who,\nattired in a dress half masculine, and bearing a weapon like the rest,\nseemed no unfit leader for the group of wildly clad frontiermen, that\nfollowed in her rear.\n\n\"Now, Abiram;\" cried the Amazon, in a voice that was cracked and\nharsh, for the simple reason of being used too often on a strained and\nunnatural key, \"now, Abiram, run with your nose low; show yourself a\nhound of the true breed, and do some credit to your training. You it was\nthat saw the prints of the Indian moccasin, and it behoves you, to let\nothers be as wise as yourself. Come; come to the front, man; and give us\na bold lead.\"\n\nThe brother, who appeared at all times to stand in awe of his sister's\nauthority, complied; though it was with a reluctance so evident, as\nto excite sneers, even among the unobservant and indolent sons of the\nsquatter. Ishmael, himself, moved among his tall children, like one who\nexpected nothing from the search, and who was indifferent alike to\nits success or failure. In this manner the party proceeded until their\ndistant fortress had sunk so low, as to present an object no larger nor\nmore distinct than a hazy point, on the margin of the prairie. Hitherto\ntheir progress had been silent and somewhat rapid, for as swell after\nswell was mounted and passed, without varying, or discovering a living\nobject to enliven the monotony of the view, even the tongue of Esther\nwas hushed in increasing anxiety. Here, however, Ishmael chose to pause,\nand casting the butt of his rifle from his shoulder to the ground, he\nobserved--\n\n\"This is enough. Buffaloe signs, and deer signs, ar' plenty; but where\nar' thy Indian footsteps, Abiram?\"\n\n\"Still farther west,\" returned the other, pointing in the direction he\nnamed. \"This was the spot where I struck the tracks of the buck; it was\nafter I took the deer, that I fell upon the Teton trail.\"\n\n\"And a bloody piece of work you made of it, man,\" cried the squatter,\npointing tauntily to the soiled garments of his kinsman, and then\ndirecting the attention of the spectators to his own, by the way of a\ntriumphant contrast. \"Here have I cut the throats of two lively does,\nand a scampering fawn, without spot or stain; while you, blundering dog\nas you ar', have made as much work for Eester and her girls, as though\nbutchering was your regular calling. Come, boys; it is enough. I am\ntoo old not to know the signs of the frontiers; no Indian has been here\nsince the last fall of water. Follow me; and I will make a turn that\nshall give us at least the beef of a fallow cow for our trouble.\"\n\n\"Follow me!\" echoed Esther, stepping undauntedly forward. \"I am leader\nto-day, and I will be followed. Who so proper, let me know, as a mother,\nto head a search for her own lost child?\"\n\nIshmael regarded his intractable mate with a smile of indulgent pity.\nObserving that she had already struck out a path for herself, different\nboth from that of Abiram and the one he had seen fit to choose, and\nbeing unwilling to draw the cord of authority too tight, just at that\nmoment, he submitted to her will. But Dr. Battius, who had hitherto been\na silent and thoughtful attendant on the woman, now saw fit to raise his\nfeeble voice in the way of remonstrance.\n\n\"I agree with thy partner in life, worthy and gentle Mrs. Bush,\" he\nsaid, \"in believing that some ignis fatuus of the imagination has\ndeceived Abiram, in the signs or symptoms of which he has spoken.\"\n\n\"Symptoms, yourself!\" interrupted the termagant. \"This is no time for\nbookish words, nor is this a place to stop and swallow medicines. If\nyou are a-leg-weary, say so, as a plain-speaking man should; then seat\nyourself on the prairie, like a hound that is foot-sore, and take your\nnatural rest.\"\n\n\"I accord in the opinion,\" the naturalist calmly replied, complying\nliterally with the opinion of the deriding Esther, by taking his seat,\nvery coolly, by the side of an indigenous shrub; the examination of\nwhich he commenced, on the instant, in order that science might not\nloose any of its just and important dues. \"I honour your excellent\nadvice, Mistress Esther, as you may perceive. Go thou in quest of thy\noffspring; while I tarry here, in pursuit of that which is better; viz.\nan insight into the arcana of Nature's volume.\"\n\nThe woman answered with a hollow, unnatural, and scornful laugh, and\neven her heavy sons, as they slowly passed the seat of the already\nabstracted naturalist, did not disdain to manifest their contempt in\nsmiles. In a few minutes the train mounted the nearest eminence, and,\nas it turned the rounded acclivity, the Doctor was left to pursue his\nprofitable investigations in entire solitude.\n\nAnother half-hour passed, during which Esther continued to advance,\non her seemingly fruitless search. Her pauses, however, were becoming\nfrequent, and her looks wandering and uncertain, when footsteps were\nheard clattering through the bottom, and at the next instant a buck was\nseen to bound up the ascent, and to dart from before their eyes, in the\ndirection of the naturalist. So sudden and unlooked for had been the\npassage of the animal, and so much had he been favoured by the shape of\nthe ground, that before any one of the foresters had time to bring his\nrifle to his shoulder, it was already beyond the range of a bullet.\n\n\"Look out for the wolf!\" shouted Abner, shaking his head in vexation, at\nbeing a single moment too late. \"A wolf's skin will be no bad gift in a\nwinter's night; ay, yonder the hungry devil comes!\"\n\n\"Hold!\" cried Ishmael, knocking up the levelled weapon of his too eager\nson. \"'Tis not a wolf; but a hound of thorough blood and bottom. Ha! we\nhave hunters nigh: there ar' two of them!\"\n\nHe was still speaking, when the animals in question came leaping on the\ntrack of the deer, striving with noble ardour to outdo each other.\nOne was an aged dog, whose strength seemed to be sustained purely by\ngenerous emulation, and the other a pup, that gambolled even while he\npressed most warmly on the chase. They both ran, however, with clean and\npowerful leaps, carrying their noses high, like animals of the most keen\nand subtle scent. They had passed; and in another minute they would have\nbeen running open-mouthed with the deer in view, had not the younger\ndog suddenly bounded from the course, and uttered a cry of surprise. His\naged companion stopped also, and returned panting and exhausted to the\nplace, where the other was whirling around in swift, and apparently in\nmad evolutions, circling the spot in his own footsteps, and continuing\nhis outcry, in a short, snappish barking. But, when the elder hound had\nreached the spot, he seated himself, and lifting his nose high into the\nair, he raised a long, loud, and wailing howl.\n\n\"It must be a strong scent,\" said Abner, who had been, with the rest of\nthe family, an admiring observer of the movements of the dogs, \"that can\nbreak off two such creatur's so suddenly from their trail.\"\n\n\"Murder them!\" cried Abiram; \"I'll swear to the old hound; 'tis the dog\nof the trapper, whom we now know to be our mortal enemy.\"\n\nThough the brother of Esther gave so hostile advice, he appeared in no\nway ready to put it in execution himself. The surprise, which had\ntaken possession of the whole party, exhibited itself in his own vacant\nwondering stare, as strongly as in any of the admiring visages by whom\nhe was surrounded. His denunciation, therefore, notwithstanding its dire\nimport, was disregarded; and the dogs were left to obey the impulses of\ntheir mysterious instinct, without let or hinderance.\n\nIt was long before any of the spectators broke the silence; but the\nsquatter, at length, so far recollected his authority, as to take on\nhimself the right to control the movements of his children.\n\n\"Come away, boys; come away, and leave the hounds to sing their tunes\nfor their own amusement,\" Ishmael said, in his coldest manner. \"I scorn\nto take the life of a beast, because its master has pitched himself too\nnigh my clearing; come away, boys, come away; we have enough of our\nown work before us, without turning aside to do that of the whole\nneighbourhood.\"\n\n\"Come not away!\" cried Esther, in tones that sounded like the\nadmonitions of some sibyl. \"I say, come not away, my children. There is\na meaning and a warning in this; and as I am a woman and a mother, will\nI know the truth of it all!\"\n\nSo saying, the awakened wife brandished her weapon, with an air that was\nnot without its wild and secret influence, and led the way towards\nthe spot where the dogs still remained, filling the air with their\nlong-drawn and piteous complaints. The whole party followed in her\nsteps, some too indolent to oppose, others obedient to her will, and all\nmore or less excited by the uncommon character of the scene.\n\n\"Tell me, you Abner--Abiram--Ishmael!\" the woman cried, standing over a\nspot where the earth was trampled and beaten, and plainly sprinkled with\nblood; \"tell me, you who ar' hunters! what sort of animal has here met\nhis death?--Speak!--Ye ar' men, and used to the signs of the plains; is\nit the blood of wolf or panther?\"\n\n\"A buffaloe--and a noble and powerful creatur' has it been!\" returned\nthe squatter, who looked down calmly on the fatal signs which so\nstrangely affected his wife. \"Here are the marks of the spot where he\nhas struck his hoofs into the earth, in the death-struggle; and yonder\nhe has plunged and torn the ground with his horns. Ay, a buffaloe bull\nof wonderful strength and courage has he been!\"\n\n\"And who has slain him?\" continued Esther; \"man where are the\noffals?--Wolves!--They devour not the hide! Tell me, ye men and hunters,\nis this the blood of a beast?\"\n\n\"The creatur' has plunged over the hillock,\" said Abner, who had\nproceeded a short distance beyond the rest of the party. \"Ah! there you\nwill find it, in yon swale of alders. Look! a thousand carrion birds,\nar' hovering above the carcass.\"\n\n\"The animal has still life in him,\" returned the squatter, \"or the\nbuzzards would settle upon their prey! By the action of the dogs it\nmust be something ravenous; I reckon it is the white bear from the upper\nfalls. They are said to cling desperately to life!\"\n\n\"Let us go back,\" said Abiram; \"there may be danger, and there can be no\ngood in attacking a ravenous beast. Remember, Ishmael, 'twill be a risky\njob, and one of small profit!\"\n\nThe young men smiled at this new proof of the well known pusillanimity\nof their uncle. The oldest even proceeded so far as to express his\ncontempt, by bluntly saying--\n\n\"It will do to cage with the other animal we carry; then we may go back\ndouble-handed into the settlements, and set up for showmen, around the\ncourt-houses and gaols of Kentucky.\"\n\nThe threatening frown, which gathered on the brow of his father,\nadmonished the young man to forbear. Exchanging looks that were half\nrebellious with his brethren, he saw fit to be silent. But instead of\nobserving the caution recommended by Abiram, they proceeded in a body,\nuntil they again came to a halt within a few yards of the matted cover\nof the thicket.\n\nThe scene had now, indeed, become wild and striking enough to have\nproduced a powerful effect on minds better prepared, than those of\nthe unnurtured family of the squatter, to resist the impressions of so\nexciting a spectacle. The heavens were, as usual at the season, covered\nwith dark, driving clouds, beneath which interminable flocks of aquatic\nbirds were again on the wing, holding their toilsome and heavy way\ntowards the distant waters of the south. The wind had risen, and was\nonce more sweeping over the prairie in gusts, which it was often vain\nto oppose; and then again the blasts would seem to mount into the upper\nair, as if to sport with the drifting vapour, whirling and rolling vast\nmasses of the dusky and ragged volumes over each other, in a terrific\nand yet grand disorder. Above the little brake, the flocks of birds\nstill held their flight, circling with heavy wings about the spot,\nstruggling at times against the torrent of wind, and then favoured by\ntheir position and height, making bold swoops upon the thicket, away\nfrom which, however, they never failed to sail, screaming in terror,\nas if apprised, either by sight or instinct, that the hour of their\nvoracious dominion had not yet fully arrived.\n\nIshmael stood for many minutes, with his wife and children clustered\ntogether, in an amazement, with which awe was singularly mingled, gazing\nin death-like stillness on the sight. The voice of Esther at length\nbroke the charm, and reminded the spectators of the necessity of\nresolving their doubts in some manner more worthy of their manhood, than\nby dull and inactive observation.\n\n\"Call in the dogs!\" she said; \"call in the hounds, and put them into the\nthicket; there ar' men enough of ye, if ye have not lost the spirit with\nwhich I know ye were born, to tame the tempers of all the bears west of\nthe big river. Call in the dogs, I say, you Enoch! Abner! Gabriel! has\nwonder made ye deaf?\"\n\nOne of the young men complied; and having succeeded in detaching the\nhounds from the place, around which, until then, they had not ceased to\nhover, he led them down to the margin of the thicket.\n\n\"Put them in, boy; put them in,\" continued the woman; \"and you, Ishmael\nand Abiram, if any thing wicked or hurtful comes forth, show them the\nuse of your rifles, like frontier-men. If ye ar' wanting in spirit,\nbefore the eyes of my children will I put ye both to shame!\"\n\nThe youths who, until now, had detained the hounds, let slip the thongs\nof skin, by which they had been held, and urged them to the attack by\ntheir voices. But, it would seem, that the elder dog was restrained by\nsome extraordinary sensation, or that he was much too experienced to\nattempt the rash adventure. After proceeding a few yards to the very\nverge of the brake, he made a sudden pause, and stood trembling in\nall his aged limbs, apparently as unable to recede as to advance. The\nencouraging calls of the young men were disregarded, or only answered\nby a low and plaintive whining. For a minute the pup also was similarly\naffected; but less sage, or more easily excited, he was induced at\nlength to leap forward, and finally to dash into the cover. An alarmed\nand startling howl was heard, and, at the next minute, he broke out\nof the thicket, and commenced circling the spot, in the same wild and\nunsteady manner as before.\n\n\"Have I a man among my children?\" demanded Esther. \"Give me a truer\npiece than a childish shotgun, and I will show ye what the courage of a\nfrontier-woman can do!\"\n\n\"Stay, mother,\" exclaimed Abner and Enoch; \"if you will see the\ncreatur', let us drive it into view.\"\n\nThis was quite as much as the youths were accustomed to utter, even on\nmore important occasions, but having given a pledge of their intentions,\nthey were far from being backward in redeeming it. Preparing their arms\nwith the utmost care, they advanced with steadiness to the brake. Nerves\nless often tried than those of the young borderers might have shrunk\nbefore the dangers of so uncertain an undertaking. As they proceeded,\nthe howls of the dogs became more shrill and plaintive. The vultures and\nbuzzards settled so low as to flap the bushes with their heavy wings,\nand the wind came hoarsely sweeping along the naked prairie, as if\nthe spirits of the air had also descended to witness the approaching\ndevelopment.\n\nThere was a breathless moment, when the blood of the undaunted Esther\nflowed backward to her heart, as she saw her sons push aside the matted\nbranches of the thicket and bury themselves in its labyrinth. A deep and\nsolemn pause succeeded. Then arose two loud and piercing cries, in\nquick succession, which were followed by a quiet, still more awful and\nappalling.\n\n\"Come back, come back, my children!\" cried the woman, the feelings of a\nmother getting the ascendency.\n\nBut her voice was hushed, and every faculty seemed frozen with horror,\nas at that instant the bushes once more parted, and the two adventurers\nre-appeared, pale, and nearly insensible themselves, and laid at her\nfeet the stiff and motionless body of the lost Asa, with the marks of a\nviolent death but too plainly stamped on every pallid lineament.\n\nThe dogs uttered a long and closing howl, and then breaking off\ntogether, they disappeared on the forsaken trail of the deer. The flight\nof birds wheeled upward into the heavens, filling the air with their\ncomplaints at having been robbed of a victim which, frightful and\ndisgusting as it was, still bore too much of the impression of humanity\nto become the prey of their obscene appetites.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n                   A pickaxe, and a spade, a spade,\n                   For,--and a shrouding sheet:\n                   O, a pit of clay for to be made\n                   For such a guest is meet.\n                                               --Song in Hamlet.\n\n\"Stand back! stand off, the whole of ye!\" said Esther hoarsely to the\ncrowd, which pressed too closely on the corpse; \"I am his mother, and\nmy right is better than that of ye all! Who has done this? Tell me,\nIshmael, Abiram, Abner! open your mouths and your hearts, and let God's\ntruth and no other issue from them. Who has done this bloody deed?\"\n\nHer husband made no reply, but stood, leaning on his rifle, looking\nsadly, but with an unaltered eye, at the mangled remains of his son. Not\nso the mother, she threw herself on the earth, and receiving the cold\nand ghastly head into her lap, she sat contemplating those muscular\nfeatures, on which the death-agony was still horridly impressed, in a\nsilence far more expressive than any language of lamentation could have\nproved.\n\nThe voice of the woman was frozen in grief. In vain Ishmael attempted\na few words of rude consolation; she neither listened nor answered. Her\nsons gathered about her in a circle, and expressed, after their uncouth\nmanner, their sympathy in her sorrow, as well as their sense of their\nown loss, but she motioned them away, impatiently with her hand. At\ntimes her fingers played in the matted hair of the dead, and at others\nthey lightly attempted to smooth the painfully expressive muscles of its\nghastly visage, as the hand of the mother is seen lingering fondly about\nthe features of her sleeping child. Then starting from their revolting\noffice, her hands would flutter around her, and seem to seek some\nfruitless remedy against the violent blow, which had thus suddenly\ndestroyed the child in whom she had not only placed her greatest\nhopes, but so much of her maternal pride. While engaged in the\nlatter incomprehensible manner, the lethargic Abner turned aside, and\nswallowing the unwonted emotions which were rising in his own throat, he\nobserved--\n\n\"Mother means that we should look for the signs, that we may know in\nwhat manner Asa has come by his end.\"\n\n\"We owe it to the accursed Siouxes!\" answered Ishmael: \"twice have\nthey put me deeply in their debt! The third time, the score shall be\ncleared!\"\n\nBut, not content with this plausible explanation, and, perhaps,\nsecretly glad to avert their eyes from a spectacle which awakened so\nextraordinary and unusual sensations in their sluggish bosoms, the sons\nof the squatter turned away in a body from their mother and the corpse,\nand proceeded to make the enquiries which they fancied the former had\nso repeatedly demanded. Ishmael made no objections; but, though he\naccompanied his children while they proceeded in the investigation, it\nwas more with the appearance of complying with their wishes, at a time\nwhen resistance might not be seemly, than with any visible interest in\nthe result. As the borderers, notwithstanding their usual dulness, were\nwell instructed in most things connected with their habits of life, an\nenquiry, the success of which depended so much on signs and evidences\nthat bore so strong a resemblance to a forest trail, was likely to be\nconducted with skill and acuteness. Accordingly, they proceeded to the\nmelancholy task with great readiness and intelligence.\n\nAbner and Enoch agreed in their accounts as to the position in which\nthey had found the body. It was seated nearly upright, the back\nsupported by a mass of matted brush, and one hand still grasping a\nbroken twig of the alders. It was most probably owing to the former\ncircumstance that the body had escaped the rapacity of the carrion\nbirds, which had been seen hovering above the thicket, and the latter\nproved that life had not yet entirely abandoned the hapless victim when\nhe entered the brake. The opinion now became general, that the youth\nhad received his death-wound in the open prairie, and had dragged\nhis enfeebled form into the cover of the thicket for the purpose of\nconcealment. A trail through the bushes confirmed this opinion. It also\nappeared, on examination, that a desperate struggle had taken place on\nthe very margin of the thicket. This was sufficiently apparent by the\ntrodden branches, the deep impressions on the moist ground, and the\nlavish flow of blood.\n\n\"He has been shot in the open ground and come here for a cover,\" said\nAbiram; \"these marks would clearly prove it. The boy has been set upon\nby the savages in a body, and has fou't like a hero as he was, until\nthey have mastered his strength, and then drawn him to the bushes.\"\n\nTo this probable opinion there was now but one dissenting voice, that of\nthe slow-minded Ishmael, who demanded that the corpse itself should be\nexamined in order to obtain a more accurate knowledge of its injuries.\nOn examination, it appeared that a rifle bullet had passed directly\nthrough the body of the deceased, entering beneath one of his brawny\nshoulders, and making its exit by the breast. It required some knowledge\nin gun-shot wounds to decide this delicate point, but the experience of\nthe borderers was quite equal to the scrutiny; and a smile of wild, and\ncertainly of singular satisfaction, passed among the sons of Ishmael,\nwhen Abner confidently announced that the enemies of Asa had assailed\nhim in the rear.\n\n\"It must be so,\" said the gloomy but attentive squatter. \"He was of too\ngood a stock and too well trained, knowingly to turn the weak side to\nman or beast! Remember, boys, that while the front of manhood is to\nyour enemy, let him be who or what he may, you ar' safe from cowardly\nsurprise. Why, Eester, woman! you ar' getting beside yourself; with\npicking at the hair and the garments of the child! Little good can you\ndo him now, old girl.\"\n\n\"See!\" interrupted Enoch, extricating from the fragments of cloth the\nmorsel of lead which had prostrated the strength of one so powerful;\n\"here is the very bullet!\"\n\nIshmael took it in his hand and eyed it long and closely.\n\n\"There's no mistake,\" at length he muttered through his compressed\nteeth. \"It is from the pouch of that accursed trapper. Like many of the\nhunters he has a mark in his mould, in order to know the work his\nrifle performs; and here you see it plainly--six little holes, laid\ncrossways.\"\n\n\"I'll swear to it!\" cried Abiram, triumphantly. \"He show'd me his\nprivate mark, himself, and boasted of the number of deer he had laid\nupon the prairies with these very bullets! Now, Ishmael, will you\nbelieve me when I tell you the old knave is a spy of the red-skins?\"\n\nThe lead passed from the hand of one to that of another, and\nunfortunately for the reputation of the old man, several among them\nremembered also to have seen the aforesaid private bullet-marks, during\nthe curious examination which all had made of his accoutrements. In\naddition to this wound, however, were many others of a less dangerous\nnature, all of which were supposed to confirm the supposed guilt of the\ntrapper.\n\nThe traces of many different struggles were to be seen, between the\nspot where the first blood was spilt and the thicket to which it was now\ngenerally believed Asa had retreated, as a place of refuge. These were\ninterpreted into so many proofs of the weakness of the murderer, who\nwould have sooner despatched his victim, had not even the dying strength\nof the youth rendered him formidable to the infirmities of one so\nold. The danger of drawing some others of the hunters to the spot, by\nrepeated firing, was deemed a sufficient reason for not again resorting\nto the rifle, after it had performed the important duty of disabling\nthe victim. The weapon of the dead man was not to be found, and had\ndoubtless, together with many other less valuable and lighter articles,\nthat he was accustomed to carry about his person, become a prize to his\ndestroyer.\n\nBut what, in addition to the tell-tale bullet, appeared to fix\nthe ruthless deed with peculiar certainty on the trapper, was\nthe accumulated evidence furnished by the trail; which proved,\nnotwithstanding his deadly hurt, that the wounded man had still been\nable to make a long and desperate resistance to the subsequent efforts\nof his murderer. Ishmael seemed to press this proof with a singular\nmixture of sorrow and pride: sorrow, at the loss of a son, whom in their\nmoments of amity he highly valued; and pride, at the courage and power\nhe had manifested to his last and weakest breath.\n\n\"He died as a son of mine should die,\" said the squatter, gleaning a\nhollow consolation from so unnatural an exultation: \"a dread to his\nenemy to the last, and without help from the law! Come, children; we\nhave the grave to make, and then to hunt his murderer.\"\n\nThe sons of the squatter set about their melancholy office, in silence\nand in sadness. An excavation was made in the hard earth, at a great\nexpense of toil and time, and the body was wrapped in such spare\nvestments as could be collected among the labourers. When these\narrangements were completed, Ishmael approached the seemingly\nunconscious Esther, and announced his intention to inter the dead. She\nheard him, and quietly relinquished her grasp of the corpse, rising\nin silence to follow it to its narrow resting place. Here she seated\nherself again at the head of the grave, watching each movement of the\nyouths with eager and jealous eyes. When a sufficiency of earth was laid\nupon the senseless clay of Asa, to protect it from injury, Enoch and\nAbner entered the cavity, and trode it into a solid mass, by the weight\nof their huge frames, with an appearance of a strange, not to say\nsavage, mixture of care and indifference. This well-known precaution\nwas adopted to prevent the speedy exhumation of the body by some of the\ncarnivorous beasts of the prairie, whose instinct was sure to guide them\nto the spot. Even the rapacious birds appeared to comprehend the nature\nof the ceremony, for, mysteriously apprised that the miserable victim\nwas now about to be abandoned by the human race, they once more began to\nmake their airy circuits above the place, screaming, as if to frighten\nthe kinsmen from their labour of caution and love.\n\nIshmael stood, with folded arms, steadily watching the manner in which\nthis necessary duty was performed, and when the whole was completed,\nhe lifted his cap to his sons, to thank them for their services, with a\ndignity that would have become one much better nurtured. Throughout the\nwhole of a ceremony, which is ever solemn and admonitory, the squatter\nhad maintained a grave and serious deportment. His vast features were\nvisibly stamped with an expression of deep concern; but at no time did\nthey falter, until he turned his back, as he believed for ever, on the\ngrave of his first-born. Nature was then stirring powerfully within\nhim, and the muscles of his stern visage began to work perceptibly. His\nchildren fastened their eyes on his, as if to seek a direction to the\nstrange emotions which were moving their own heavy natures, when the\nstruggle in the bosom of the squatter suddenly ceased, and, taking his\nwife by the arm, he raised her to her feet as if she had been an infant,\nsaying, in a voice that was perfectly steady, though a nice observer\nwould have discovered that it was kinder than usual--\n\n\"Eester, we have now done all that man and woman can do. We raised the\nboy, and made him such as few others were like, on the frontiers of\nAmerica; and we have given him a grave. Let us go our way.\"\n\nThe woman turned her eyes slowly from the fresh earth, and laying her\nhands on the shoulders of her husband, stood, looking him anxiously in\nthe eyes.\n\n\"Ishmael! Ishmael!\" she said, \"you parted from the boy in your wrath!\"\n\n\"May the Lord pardon his sins freely as I have forgiven his worst\nmisdeeds!\" calmly returned the squatter: \"woman, go you back to the rock\nand read your Bible; a chapter in that book always does you good. You\ncan read, Eester; which is a privilege I never did enjoy.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" muttered the woman, yielding to his strength, and suffering\nherself to be led, though with strong reluctance from the spot. \"I can\nread; and how have I used the knowledge! But he, Ishmael, he has not the\nsin of wasted l'arning to answer for. We have spared him that, at least!\nwhether it be in mercy, or in cruelty, I know not.\"\n\nHer husband made no reply, but continued steadily to lead her in the\ndirection of their temporary abode. When they reached the summit of\nthe swell of land, which they knew was the last spot from which the\nsituation of the grave of Asa could be seen, they all turned, as by\ncommon concurrence, to take a farewell view of the place. The little\nmound itself was not visible; but it was frightfully indicated by the\nflock of screaming birds which hovered above. In the opposite direction\na low, blue hillock, in the skirts of the horizon, pointed out the place\nwhere Esther had left the rest of her young, and served as an attraction\nto draw her reluctant steps from the last abode of her eldest born.\nNature quickened in the bosom of the mother at the sight; and she\nfinally yielded the rights of the dead, to the more urgent claims of the\nliving.\n\nThe foregoing occurrences had struck a spark from the stern tempers of a\nset of beings so singularly moulded in the habits of their uncultivated\nlives, which served to keep alive among them the dying embers of family\naffection. United to their parents by ties no stronger than those which\nuse had created, there had been great danger, as Ishmael had foreseen,\nthat the overloaded hive would swarm, and leave him saddled with the\ndifficulties of a young and helpless brood, unsupported by the exertions\nof those, whom he had already brought to a state of maturity. The spirit\nof insubordination, which emanated from the unfortunate Asa, had spread\namong his juniors; and the squatter had been made painfully to remember\nthe time when, in the wantonness of his youth and vigour, he had,\nreversing the order of the brutes, cast off his own aged and failing\nparents, to enter into the world unshackled and free. But the danger had\nnow abated, for a time at least; and if his authority was not restored\nwith all its former influence, it was admitted to exist, and to maintain\nits ascendency a little longer.\n\nIt is true that his slow-minded sons, even while they submitted to the\nimpressions of the recent event, had glimmerings of terrible distrusts,\nas to the manner in which their elder brother had met with his death.\nThere were faint and indistinct images in the minds of two or three of\nthe oldest, which portrayed the father himself, as ready to imitate the\nexample of Abraham, without the justification of the sacred authority\nwhich commanded the holy man to attempt the revolting office. But then,\nthese images were so transient, and so much obscured in intellectual\nmists, as to leave no very strong impressions, and the tendency of the\nwhole transaction, as we have already said, was rather to strengthen\nthan to weaken the authority of Ishmael.\n\nIn this disposition of mind, the party continued their route towards\nthe place whence they had that morning issued on a search which had been\ncrowned with so melancholy a success. The long and fruitless march which\nthey had made under the direction of Abiram, the discovery of the body,\nand its subsequent interment, had so far consumed the day, that by the\ntime their steps were retraced across the broad track of waste which lay\nbetween the grave of Asa and the rock, the sun had fallen far below his\nmeridian altitude. The hill had gradually risen as they approached, like\nsome tower emerging from the bosom of the sea, and when within a mile,\nthe minuter objects that crowned its height came dimly into view.\n\n\"It will be a sad meeting for the girls!\" said Ishmael, who, from time\nto time, did not cease to utter something which he intended should be\nconsolatory to the bruised spirit of his partner. \"Asa was much regarded\nby all the young; and seldom failed to bring in from his hunts something\nthat they loved.\"\n\n\"He did, he did,\" murmured Esther; \"the boy was the pride of the family.\nMy other children are as nothing to him!\"\n\n\"Say not so, good woman,\" returned the father, glancing his eye a little\nproudly at the athletic train which followed, at no great distance,\nin the rear\". Say not so, old Eester, for few fathers and mothers have\ngreater reason to be boastful than ourselves.\"\n\n\"Thankful, thankful,\" muttered the humbled woman; \"ye mean thankful,\nIshmael!\"\n\n\"Then thankful let it be, if you like the word better, my good\ngirl,--but what has become of Nelly and the young? The child has\nforgotten the charge I gave her, and has not only suffered the children\nto sleep, but, I warrant you, is dreaming of the fields of Tennessee\nat this very moment. The mind of your niece is mainly fixed on the\nsettlements, I reckon.\"\n\n\"Ay, she is not for us; I said it, and thought it, when I took her,\nbecause death had stripped her of all other friends. Death is a sad\nworker in the bosom of families, Ishmael! Asa had a kind feeling to the\nchild, and they might have come one day into our places, had things been\nso ordered.\"\n\n\"Nay, she is not gifted for a frontier wife, if this is the manner she\nis to keep house while the husband is on the hunt. Abner, let off your\nrifle, that they may know we ar' coming. I fear Nelly and the young ar'\nasleep.\" The young man complied with an alacrity that manifested how\ngladly he would see the rounded, active figure of Ellen, enlivening\nthe ragged summit of the rock. But the report was succeeded by neither\nsignal nor answer of any sort. For a moment, the whole party stood in\nsuspense, awaiting the result, and then a simultaneous impulse caused\nthe whole to let off their pieces at the same instant, producing a\nnoise which might not fail to reach the ears of all within so short a\ndistance.\n\n\"Ah! there they come at last!\" cried Abiram, who was usually among\nthe first to seize on any circumstance which promised relief from\ndisagreeable apprehensions.\n\n\"It is a petticoat fluttering on the line,\" said Esther; \"I put it there\nmyself.\"\n\n\"You ar' right; but now she comes; the jade has been taking her comfort\nin the tent!\"\n\n\"It is not so,\" said Ishmael, whose usually inflexible features were\nbeginning to manifest the uneasiness he felt. \"It is the tent itself\nblowing about loosely in the wind. They have loosened the bottom, like\nsilly children as they ar', and unless care is had, the whole will come\ndown!\"\n\nThe words were scarcely uttered before a rushing blast of wind swept\nby the spot where they stood, raising the dust in little eddies, in its\nprogress; and then, as if guided by a master hand, it quitted the\nearth, and mounted to the precise spot on which all eyes were just\nthen riveted. The loosened linen felt its influence and tottered; but\nregained its poise, and, for a moment, it became tranquil. The cloud of\nleaves next played in circling revolutions around the place, and then\ndescended with the velocity of a swooping hawk, and sailed away into\nthe prairie in long straight lines, like a flight of swallows resting\non their expanded wings. They were followed for some distance by the\nsnow-white tent, which, however, soon fell behind the rock, leaving\nits highest peak as naked as when it lay in the entire solitude of the\ndesert.\n\n\"The murderers have been here!\" moaned Esther. \"My babes! my babes!\"\n\nFor a moment even Ishmael faltered before the weight of so unexpected a\nblow. But shaking himself, like an awakened lion, he sprang forward,\nand pushing aside the impediments of the barrier, as if they had been\nfeathers, he rushed up the ascent with an impetuosity which proved how\nformidable a sluggish nature may become, when thoroughly aroused.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n                Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?\n                                                    --King John.\n\nIn order to preserve an even pace between the incidents of the tale, it\nbecomes necessary to revert to such events as occurred during the ward\nof Ellen Wade.\n\nFor the few first hours, the cares of the honest and warm-hearted girl\nwere confined to the simple offices of satisfying the often-repeated\ndemands which her younger associates made on her time and patience,\nunder the pretences of hunger, thirst, and all the other ceaseless wants\nof captious and inconsiderate childhood. She had seized a moment from\ntheir importunities to steal into the tent, where she was administering\nto the comforts of one far more deserving of her tenderness, when an\noutcry among the children recalled her to the duties she had momentarily\nforgotten.\n\n\"See, Nelly, see!\" exclaimed half a dozen eager voices; \"yonder ar' men;\nand Phoebe says that they ar' Sioux-Indians!\"\n\nEllen turned her eyes in the direction in which so many arms were\nalready extended, and, to her consternation, beheld several men,\nadvancing manifestly and swiftly in a straight line towards the rock.\nShe counted four, but was unable to make out any thing concerning their\ncharacters, except that they were not any of those who of right were\nentitled to admission into the fortress. It was a fearful moment for\nEllen. Looking around, at the juvenile and frightened flock that pressed\nupon the skirts of her garments, she endeavoured to recall to her\nconfused faculties some one of the many tales of female heroism, with\nwhich the history of the western frontier abounded. In one, a stockade\nhad been successfully defended by a single man, supported by three or\nfour women, for days, against the assaults of a hundred enemies. In\nanother, the women alone had been able to protect the children, and\nthe less valuable effects of their absent husbands; and a third was not\nwanting, in which a solitary female had destroyed her sleeping captors\nand given liberty not only to herself, but to a brood of helpless young.\nThis was the case most nearly assimilated to the situation in which\nEllen now found herself; and, with flushing cheeks and kindling eyes,\nthe girl began to consider, and to prepare her slender means of defence.\n\nShe posted the larger girls at the little levers that were to cast the\nrocks on the assailants, the smaller were to be used more for show than\nany positive service they could perform, while, like any other leader,\nshe reserved her own person, as a superintendent and encourager of the\nwhole. When these dispositions were made, she endeavoured to await the\nissue, with an air of composure, that she intended should inspire her\nassistants with the confidence necessary to ensure success.\n\nAlthough Ellen was vastly their superior in that spirit which emanates\nfrom moral qualities, she was by no means the equal of the two eldest\ndaughters of Esther, in the important military property of insensibility\nto danger. Reared in the hardihood of a migrating life, on the skirts of\nsociety, where they had become familiarised to the sights and dangers\nof the wilderness, these girls promised fairly to become, at some future\nday, no less distinguished than their mother for daring, and for that\nsingular mixture of good and evil, which, in a wider sphere of action,\nwould probably have enabled the wife of the squatter to enrol her name\namong the remarkable females of her time. Esther had already, on one\noccasion, made good the log tenement of Ishmael against an inroad of\nsavages; and on another, she had been left for dead by her enemies,\nafter a defence that, with a more civilised foe, would have entitled her\nto the honours of a liberal capitulation. These facts, and sundry\nothers of a similar nature, had often been recapitulated with suitable\nexultation in the presence of her daughters, and the bosoms of the young\nAmazons were now strangely fluctuating between natural terror and the\nambitious wish to do something that might render them worthy of being\nthe children of such a mother. It appeared that the opportunity for\ndistinction, of this wild character, was no longer to be denied them.\n\nThe party of strangers was already within a hundred rods of the rock.\nEither consulting their usual wary method of advancing, or admonished\nby the threatening attitudes of two figures, who had thrust forth the\nbarrels of as many old muskets from behind the stone entrenchment, the\nnew comers halted, under favour of an inequality in the ground, where\na growth of grass thicker than common offered the advantage of\nconcealment. From this spot they reconnoitred the fortress for several\nanxious, and to Ellen, interminable minutes. Then one advanced singly,\nand apparently more in the character of a herald than of an assailant.\n\n\"Phoebe, do you fire,\" and \"no, Hetty, you,\" were beginning to be heard\nbetween the half-frightened and yet eager daughters of the squatter,\nwhen Ellen probably saved the advancing stranger from some imminent\nalarm, if from no greater danger, by exclaiming--\n\n\"Lay down the muskets; it is Dr. Battius!\"\n\nHer subordinates so far complied, as to withdraw their hands from the\nlocks, though the threatening barrels still maintained the portentous\nlevels. The naturalist, who had advanced with sufficient deliberation\nto note the smallest hostile demonstration of the garrison, now raised\na white handkerchief on the end of his fusee, and came within speaking\ndistance of the fortress. Then, assuming what he intended should be an\nimposing and dignified semblance of authority, he blustered forth, in a\nvoice that might have been heard at a much greater distance--\n\n\"What, ho! I summon ye all, in the name of the Confederacy of the United\nSovereign States of North America, to submit yourselves to the laws.\"\n\n\"Doctor or no Doctor; he is an enemy, Nelly; hear him! hear him! he\ntalks of the law.\"\n\n\"Stop! stay till I hear his answer!\" said the nearly breathless Ellen,\npushing aside the dangerous weapons which were again pointed in the\ndirection of the shrinking person of the herald.\n\n\"I admonish and forewarn ye all,\" continued the startled Doctor, \"that I\nam a peaceful citizen of the before named Confederacy, or to speak with\ngreater accuracy, Union, a supporter of the Social Compact, and a lover\nof good order and amity;\" then, perceiving that the danger was, at\nleast, temporarily removed, he once more raised his voice to the hostile\npitch,--\"I charge ye all, therefore, to submit to the laws.\"\n\n\"I thought you were a friend,\" Ellen replied; \"and that you travelled\nwith my uncle, in virtue of an agreement--\"\n\n\"It is void! I have been deceived in the very premises, and, I hereby\npronounce, a certain compactum, entered into and concluded between\nIshmael Bush, squatter, and Obed Battius, M.D., to be incontinently\nnull and of non-effect. Nay, children, to be null is merely a negative\nproperty, and is fraught with no evil to your worthy parent; so lay\naside the fire-arms, and listen to the admonitions of reason. I declare\nit vicious--null--abrogated. As for thee, Nelly, my feelings towards\nthee are not at all given to hostility; therefore listen to that which\nI have to utter, nor turn away thine ears in the wantonness of security.\nThou knowest the character of the man with whom thou dwellest, young\nwoman, and thou also knowest the danger of being found in evil company.\nAbandon, then, the trifling advantages of thy situation, and yield the\nrock peaceably to the will of those who accompany me--a legion, young\nwoman--I do assure you an invincible and powerful legion! Render,\ntherefore, the effects of this lawless and wicked squatter,--nay,\nchildren, such disregard of human life, is frightful in those who\nhave so recently received the gift, in their own persons! Point those\ndangerous weapons aside, I entreat of you; more for your own sakes, than\nfor mine. Hetty, hast thou forgotten who appeased thine anguish when\nthy auricular nerves were tortured by the colds and damps of the naked\nearth! and thou, Phoebe, ungrateful and forgetful Phoebe! but for this\nvery arm, which you would prostrate with an endless paralysis, thy\nincisores would still be giving thee pain and sorrow! Lay, then, aside\nthy weapons, and hearken to the advice of one who has always been\nthy friend. And now, young woman,\" still keeping a jealous eye on the\nmuskets which the girl had suffered to be diverted a little from their\naim,--\"and now, young woman, for the last, and therefore the most solemn\nasking: I demand of thee the surrender of this rock, without delay or\nresistance, in the joint names of power, of justice, and of the--\" law\nhe would have added; but recollecting that this ominous word would\nagain provoke the hostility of the squatter's children, he succeeded in\nswallowing it in good season, and concluded with the less dangerous and\nmore convertible term of \"reason.\"\n\nThis extraordinary summons failed, however, of producing the desired\neffect. It proved utterly unintelligible to his younger listeners,\nwith the exception of the few offensive terms, already sufficiently\ndistinguished, and though Ellen better comprehended the meaning of the\nherald, she appeared as little moved by his rhetoric as her companions.\nAt those passages which he intended should be tender and affecting,\nthe intelligent girl, though tortured by painful feelings, had even\nmanifested a disposition to laugh, while to the threats she turned an\nutterly insensible ear.\n\n\"I know not the meaning of all you wish to say, Dr. Battius,\" she\nquietly replied, when he had ended; \"but I am sure if it would teach\nme to betray my trust, it is what I ought not to hear. I caution you to\nattempt no violence, for let my wishes be what they may, you see I am\nsurrounded by a force that can easily put me down, and you know, or\nought to know, too well the temper of this family, to trifle in such\na matter with any of its members, let them be of what sex or age they\nmay.\"\n\n\"I am not entirely ignorant of human character,\" returned the\nnaturalist, prudently receding a little from the position, which he had,\nuntil now, stoutly maintained at the very base of the hill. \"But here\ncomes one who may know its secret windings still better than I.\"\n\n\"Ellen! Ellen Wade,\" cried Paul Hover, who had advanced to his elbow,\nwithout betraying any of that sensitiveness which had so manifestly\ndiscomposed the Doctor; \"I didn't expect to find an enemy in you!\"\n\n\"Nor shall you, when you ask that, which I can grant without treachery.\nYou know that my uncle has trusted his family to my care, and shall I\nso far betray the trust as to let in his bitterest enemies to murder his\nchildren, perhaps, and to rob him of the little which the Indians have\nleft?\"\n\n\"Am I a murderer--is this old man--this officer of the States,\" pointing\nto the trapper and his newly discovered friend, both of whom by this\ntime stood at his side, \"is either of these likely to do the things you\nname?\"\n\n\"What is it then you ask of me?\" said Ellen, wringing her hands, in\nexcessive doubt.\n\n\"The beast! nothing more nor less than the squatter's hidden, ravenous,\ndangerous beast!\"\n\n\"Excellent young woman,\" commenced the young stranger, who had so\nlately joined himself to the party on the prairie--but his mouth\nwas immediately stopped by a significant sign from the trapper, who\nwhispered in his ear--\n\n\"Let the lad be our spokesman. Natur' will work in the bosom of the\nchild, and we shall gain our object, in good time.\"\n\n\"The whole truth is out, Ellen,\" Paul continued, \"and we have lined\nthe squatter into his most secret misdoings. We have come to right the\nwronged and to free the imprisoned; now, if you are the girl of a true\nheart, as I have always believed, so far from throwing straws in our\nway, you will join in the general swarming, and leave old Ishmael and\nhis hive to the bees of his own breed.\"\n\n\"I have sworn a solemn oath--\"\n\n\"A compactum which is entered into through ignorance, or in duresse, is\nnull in the sight of all good moralists,\" cried the Doctor.\n\n\"Hush, hush,\" again the trapper whispered; \"leave it all to natur' and\nthe lad!\"\n\n\"I have sworn in the sight and by the name of Him who is the founder\nand ruler of all that is good, whether it be in morals or in religion,\"\nEllen continued, \"neither to reveal the contents of that tent, nor to\nhelp its prisoner to escape. We are both solemnly, terribly, sworn; our\nlives perhaps have been the gift we received for the promises. It is\ntrue you are masters of the secret, but not through any means of ours;\nnor do I know that I can justify myself, for even being neutral, while\nyou attempt to invade the dwelling of my uncle in this hostile manner.\"\n\n\"I can prove beyond the power of refutation,\" the naturalist eagerly\nexclaimed, \"by Paley, Berkeley, ay, even by the immortal Binkerschoek,\nthat a compactum, concluded while one of the parties, be it a state or\nbe it an individual, is in durance--\"\n\n\"You will ruffle the temper of the child, with your abusive language,\"\nsaid the cautious trapper, \"while the lad, if left to human feelings,\nwill bring her down to the meekness of a fawn. Ah! you are like myself,\nlittle knowing in the natur' of hidden kindnesses!\"\n\n\"Is this the only vow you have taken, Ellen?\" Paul continued in a tone\nwhich, for the gay, light-hearted bee-hunter, sounded dolorous and\nreproachful. \"Have you sworn only to this? are the words which the\nsquatter says, to be as honey in your mouth, and all other promises like\nso much useless comb?\"\n\nThe paleness, which had taken possession of the usually cheerful\ncountenance of Ellen, was hid in a bright glow, that was plainly visible\neven at the distance at which she stood. She hesitated a moment, as\nif struggling to repress something very like resentment, before she\nanswered with all her native spirit--\n\n\"I know not what right any one has to question me about oaths and\npromises, which can only concern her who has made them, if, indeed,\nany of the sort you mention have ever been made at all. I shall hold\nno further discourse with one who thinks so much of himself, and takes\nadvice merely of his own feelings.\"\n\n\"Now, old trapper, do you hear that!\" said the unsophisticated\nbee-hunter, turning abruptly to his aged friend. \"The meanest insect\nthat skims the heavens, when it has got its load, flies straight and\nhonestly to its nest or hive, according to its kind; but the ways of a\nwoman's mind are as knotty as a gnarled oak, and more crooked than the\nwindings of the Mississippi!\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, child,\" said the trapper, good-naturedly interfering in\nbehalf of the offending Paul, \"you are to consider that youth is hasty,\nand not overgiven to thought. But then a promise is a promise, and\nnot to be thrown aside and forgotten, like the hoofs and horns of a\nbuffaloe.\"\n\n\"I thank you for reminding me of my oath,\" said the still resentful\nEllen, biting her pretty nether lip with vexation; \"I might else have\nproved forgetful!\"\n\n\"Ah! female natur' is awakened in her,\" said the old man, shaking his\nhead in a manner to show how much he was disappointed in the result;\n\"but it manifests itself against the true spirit!\"\n\n\"Ellen!\" cried the young stranger, who until now had been an attentive\nlistener to the parley, \"since Ellen is the name by which you are\nknown--\"\n\n\"They often add to it another. I am sometimes called by the name of my\nfather.\"\n\n\"Call her Nelly Wade at once,\" muttered Paul; \"it is her rightful name,\nand I care not if she keeps it for ever!\"\n\n\"Wade, I should have added,\" continued the youth. \"You will acknowledge\nthat, though bound by no oath myself, I at least have known how to\nrespect those of others. You are a witness yourself that I have forborne\nto utter a single call, while I am certain it could reach those ears\nit would gladden so much. Permit me then to ascend the rock, singly;\nI promise a perfect indemnity to your kinsman, against any injury his\neffects may sustain.\"\n\nEllen seemed to hesitate, but catching a glimpse of Paul, who stood\nleaning proudly on his rifle, whistling, with an appearance of the\nutmost indifference, the air of a boating song, she recovered her\nrecollection in time to answer,--\n\n\"I have been left the captain of the rock, while my uncle and his sons\nhunt, and captain will I remain till he returns to receive back the\ncharge.\"\n\n\"This is wasting moments that will not soon return, and neglecting\nan opportunity that may never occur again,\" the young soldier gravely\nremarked. \"The sun is beginning to fall already, and many minutes cannot\nelapse before the squatter and his savage brood will be returning to\ntheir huts.\"\n\nDoctor Battius cast a glance behind him, and took up the discourse, by\nsaying--\n\n\"Perfection is always found in maturity, whether it be in the animal\nor in the intellectual world. Reflection is the mother of wisdom, and\nwisdom the parent of success. I propose that we retire to a discreet\ndistance from this impregnable position, and there hold a convocation,\nor council, to deliberate on what manner we may sit down regularly\nbefore the place; or, perhaps, by postponing the siege to another\nseason, gain the aid of auxiliaries from the inhabited countries, and\nthus secure the dignity of the laws from any danger of a repulse.\"\n\n\"A storm would be better,\" the soldier smilingly answered, measuring the\nheight and scanning all its difficulties with a deliberate eye; \"'twould\nbe but a broken arm or a bruised head at the worst.\"\n\n\"Then have at it!\" shouted the impetuous bee-hunter, making a spring\nthat at once put him out of danger from shot, by carrying him beneath\nthe projecting ledge on which the garrison was posted; \"now do your\nworst, young devils of a wicked breed; you have but a moment to work\nyour mischief!\"\n\n\"Paul! rash Paul!\" shrieked Ellen; \"another step and the rocks will\ncrush you! they hang by but a thread, and these girls are ready and\nwilling to let them fall!\"\n\n\"Then drive the accursed swarm from the hive; for scale the rock I will,\nthough I find it covered with hornets.\"\n\n\"Let her if she dare!\" tauntingly cried the eldest of the girls,\nbrandishing a musket with a mien and resolution that would have done\ncredit to her Amazonian dam. \"I know you, Nelly Wade; you are with the\nlawyers in your heart, and if you come a foot nigher, you shall have\nfrontier punishment. Put in another pry, girls; in with it! I should\nlike to see the man, of them all, that dare come up into the camp of\nIshmael Bush, without asking leave of his children!\"\n\n\"Stir not, Paul; for your life keep beneath the rock!\"\n\nEllen was interrupted by the same bright vision, which on the preceding\nday had stayed another scarcely less portentous tumult, by exhibiting\nitself on the same giddy height, where it was now seen.\n\n\"In the name of Him, who commandeth all, I implore you to pause--both\nyou, who so madly incur the risk, and you, who so rashly offer to take\nthat which you never can return!\" said a voice, in a slightly foreign\naccent, that instantly drew all eyes upward.\n\n\"Inez!\" cried the officer, \"do I again see you! mine shall you now\nbe, though a million devils were posted on this rock. Push up, brave\nwoodsman, and give room for another!\"\n\nThe sudden appearance of the figure from the tent had created a\nmomentary stupor among the defendants of the rock, which might, with\nsuitable forbearance, have been happily improved; but startled by the\nvoice of Middleton, the surprised Phoebe discharged her musket at the\nfemale, scarcely knowing whether she aimed at the life of a mortal or\nat some being which belonged to another world. Ellen uttered a cry of\nhorror, and then sprang after her alarmed or wounded friend, she knew\nnot which, into the tent.\n\nDuring this moment of dangerous by-play, the sounds of a serious attack\nwere very distinctly audible beneath. Paul had profited by the commotion\nover his head to change his place so far, as to make room for Middleton.\nThe latter was followed by the naturalist, who, in a state of mental\naberration, produced by the report of the musket, had instinctively\nrushed towards the rocks for cover. The trapper remained where he was\nlast seen, an unmoved but close observer of the several proceedings.\nThough averse to enter into actual hostilities, the old man was,\nhowever, far from being useless. Favoured by his position, he was\nenabled to apprise his friends of the movements of those who plotted\ntheir destruction above, and to advise and control their advance\naccordingly.\n\nIn the mean time, the children of Esther were true to the spirit they\nhad inherited from their redoubtable mother. The instant they found\nthemselves delivered from the presence of Ellen and her unknown\ncompanion, they bestowed an undivided attention on their more masculine\nand certainly more dangerous assailants, who by this time had made a\ncomplete lodgment among the crags of the citadel. The repeated summons\nto surrender, which Paul uttered in a voice that he intended should\nstrike terror in their young bosoms, were as little heeded as were the\ncalls of the trapper to abandon a resistance, which might prove fatal to\nsome among them, without offering the smallest probability of eventual\nsuccess. Encouraging each other to persevere, they poised the fragments\nof rocks, prepared the lighter missiles for immediate service, and\nthrust forward the barrels of the muskets with a business-like air, and\na coolness, that would have done credit to men practised in warfare.\n\n\"Keep under the ledge,\" said the trapper, pointing out to Paul the\nmanner in which he should proceed; \"keep in your foot more, lad--ah! you\nsee the warning was not amiss! had the stone struck it, the bees would\nhave had the prairies to themselves. Now, namesake of my friend; Uncas,\nin name and spirit! now, if you have the activity of Le Cerf Agile, you\nmay make a far leap to the right, and gain twenty feet, without danger.\nBeware the bush--beware the bush! 'twill prove a treacherous hold! Ah!\nhe has done it; safely and bravely has he done it! Your turn comes next,\nfriend; that follows the fruits of natur'. Push you to the left, and\ndivide the attention of the children. Nay, girls, fire,--my old ears\nare used to the whistling of lead; and little reason have I to prove a\ndoe-heart, with fourscore years on my back.\" He shook his head with\na melancholy smile, but without flinching in a muscle, as the bullet,\nwhich the exasperated Hetty fired, passed innocently at no great\ndistance from the spot where he stood. \"It is safer keeping in your\ntrack than dodging when a weak finger pulls the trigger,\" he continued\n\"but it is a solemn sight to witness how much human natur' is inclined\nto evil, in one so young! Well done, my man of beasts and plants!\nAnother such leap, and you may laugh at all the squatter's bars and\nwalls. The Doctor has got his temper up! I see it in his eye, and\nsomething good will come of him! Keep closer, man--keep closer.\"\n\nThe trapper, though he was not deceived as to the state of Dr. Battius'\nmind, was, however, greatly in error as to the exciting cause. While\nimitating the movements of his companions, and toiling his way upward\nwith the utmost caution, and not without great inward tribulation, the\neye of the naturalist had caught a glimpse of an unknown plant, a few\nyards above his head, and in a situation more than commonly exposed to\nthe missiles which the girls were unceasingly hurling in the direction\nof the assailants. Forgetting, in an instant, every thing but the glory\nof being the first to give this jewel to the catalogues of science, he\nsprang upward at the prize with the avidity with which the sparrow darts\nupon the butterfly. The rocks, which instantly came thundering down,\nannounced that he was seen; and for a moment, while his form was\nconcealed in the cloud of dust and fragments which followed the furious\ndescent, the trapper gave him up for lost; but the next instant he was\nseen safely seated in a cavity formed by some of the projecting stones\nwhich had yielded to the shock, holding triumphantly in his hand the\ncaptured stem, which he was already devouring with delighted, and\ncertainly not unskilful, eyes. Paul profited by the opportunity. Turning\nhis course, with the quickness of thought, he sprang to the post which\nObed thus securely occupied, and unceremoniously making a footstool\nof his shoulder, as the latter stooped over his treasure, he bounded\nthrough the breach left by the fallen rock, and gained the level. He\nwas followed by Middleton, who joined him in seizing and disarming the\ngirls. In this manner a bloodless and complete victory was obtained\nover that citadel which Ishmael had vainly flattered himself might prove\nimpregnable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n              So smile the heavens upon this holy act,\n              That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nIt is proper that the course of the narrative should be stayed, while\nwe revert to those causes, which have brought in their train of\nconsequences, the singular contest just related. The interruption must\nnecessarily be as brief as we hope it may prove satisfactory to that\nclass of readers, who require that no gap should be left by those who\nassume the office of historians, for their own fertile imaginations to\nfill.\n\nAmong the troops sent by the government of the United States, to take\npossession of its newly acquired territory in the west, was a detachment\nled by a young soldier who has become so busy an actor in the scenes of\nour legend. The mild and indolent descendants of the ancient colonists\nreceived their new compatriots without distrust, well knowing that\nthe transfer raised them from the condition of subjects, to the more\nenviable distinction of citizens in a government of laws. The new rulers\nexercised their functions with discretion, and wielded their delegated\nauthority without offence. In such a novel intermixture, however, of\nmen born and nurtured in freedom, and the compliant minions of absolute\npower, the catholic and the protestant, the active and the indolent,\nsome little time was necessary to blend the discrepant elements of\nsociety. In attaining so desirable an end, woman was made to perform her\naccustomed and grateful office. The barriers of prejudice and religion\nwere broken through by the irresistible power of the master-passion,\nand family unions, ere long, began to cement the political tie which had\nmade a forced conjunction, between people so opposite in their habits,\ntheir educations, and their opinions.\n\nMiddleton was among the first, of the new possessors of the soil, who\nbecame captive to the charms of a Louisianian lady. In the immediate\nvicinity of the post he had been directed to occupy, dwelt the chief\nof one of those ancient colonial families, which had been content to\nslumber for ages amid the ease, indolence, and wealth of the Spanish\nprovinces. He was an officer of the crown, and had been induced to\nremove from the Floridas, among the French of the adjoining province, by\na rich succession of which he had become the inheritor. The name of\nDon Augustin de Certavallos was scarcely known beyond the limits of\nthe little town in which he resided, though he found a secret pleasure\nhimself in pointing it out, in large scrolls of musty documents, to an\nonly child, as enrolled among the former heroes and grandees of Old and\nof New Spain. This fact, so important to himself and of so little\nmoment to any body else, was the principal reason, that while his more\nvivacious Gallic neighbours were not slow to open a frank communion\nwith their visiters, he chose to keep aloof, seemingly content with the\nsociety of his daughter, who was a girl just emerging from the condition\nof childhood into that of a woman.\n\nThe curiosity of the youthful Inez, however, was not so inactive. She\nhad not heard the martial music of the garrison, melting on the evening\nair, nor seen the strange banner, which fluttered over the heights that\nrose at no great distance from her father's extensive grounds, without\nexperiencing some of those secret impulses which are thought to\ndistinguish the sex. Natural timidity, and that retiring and perhaps\npeculiar lassitude, which forms the very groundwork of female\nfascination, in the tropical provinces of Spain, held her in their\nseemingly indissoluble bonds; and it is more than probable, that had not\nan accident occurred, in which Middleton was of some personal service\nto her father, so long a time would have elapsed before they met, that\nanother direction might have been given to the wishes of one, who was\njust of an age to be alive to all the power of youth and beauty.\n\nProvidence--or if that imposing word is too just to be classical,\nfate--had otherwise decreed. The haughty and reserved Don Augustin was\nby far too observant of the forms of that station, on which he so much\nvalued himself, to forget the duties of a gentleman. Gratitude, for the\nkindness of Middleton, induced him to open his doors to the officers of\nthe garrison, and to admit of a guarded but polite intercourse. Reserve\ngradually gave way before the propriety and candour of their spirited\nyoung leader, and it was not long ere the affluent planter rejoiced\nas much as his daughter, whenever the well known signal, at the gate,\nannounced one of these agreeable visits from the commander of the post.\n\nIt is unnecessary to dwell on the impression which the charms of Inez\nproduced on the soldier, or to delay the tale in order to write a\nwire-drawn account of the progressive influence that elegance of\ndeportment, manly beauty, and undivided assiduity and intelligence were\nlikely to produce on the sensitive mind of a romantic, warm-hearted, and\nsecluded girl of sixteen. It is sufficient for our purpose to say that\nthey loved, that the youth was not backward to declare his feelings,\nthat he prevailed with some facility over the scruples of the maiden,\nand with no little difficulty over the objections of her father,\nand that before the province of Louisiana had been six months in the\npossession of the States, the officer of the latter was the affianced\nhusband of the richest heiress on the banks of the Mississippi.\n\nAlthough we have presumed the reader to be acquainted with the manner in\nwhich such results are commonly attained, it is not to be supposed that\nthe triumph of Middleton, either over the prejudices of the father or\nover those of the daughter, was achieved without difficulty. Religion\nformed a stubborn and nearly irremovable obstacle with both. The devoted\nman patiently submitted to a formidable essay, father Ignatius was\ndeputed to make in order to convert him to the true faith. The effort\non the part of the worthy priest was systematic, vigorous, and long\nsustained. A dozen times (it was at those moments when glimpses of the\nlight, sylphlike form of Inez flitted like some fairy being past the\nscene of their conferences) the good father fancied he was on the eve of\na glorious triumph over infidelity; but all his hopes were frustrated\nby some unlooked-for opposition, on the part of the subject of his pious\nlabours. So long as the assault on his faith was distant and feeble,\nMiddleton, who was no great proficient in polemics, submitted to its\neffects with the patience and humility of a martyr; but the moment the\ngood father, who felt such concern in his future happiness, was tempted\nto improve his vantage ground by calling in the aid of some of the\npeculiar subtilties of his own creed, the young man was too good a\nsoldier not to make head against the hot attack. He came to the contest,\nit is true, with no weapons more formidable than common sense, and some\nlittle knowledge of the habits of his country as contrasted with that\nof his adversary; but with these homebred implements he never failed\nto repulse the father with something of the power with which a nervous\ncudgel player would deal with a skilful master of the rapier, setting at\nnought his passados by the direct and unanswerable arguments of a broken\nhead and a shivered weapon.\n\nBefore the controversy was terminated, an inroad of Protestants had come\nto aid the soldier. The reckless freedom of such among them, as thought\nonly of this life, and the consistent and tempered piety of others,\ncaused the honest priest to look about him in concern. The influence of\nexample on one hand, and the contamination of too free an intercourse on\nthe other, began to manifest themselves, even in that portion of his own\nflock, which he had supposed to be too thoroughly folded in spiritual\ngovernment ever to stray. It was time to turn his thoughts from the\noffensive, and to prepare his followers to resist the lawless deluge\nof opinion, which threatened to break down the barriers of their faith.\nLike a wise commander, who finds he has occupied too much ground for the\namount of his force, he began to curtail his outworks. The relics were\nconcealed from profane eyes; his people were admonished not to speak of\nmiracles before a race that not only denied their existence, but who\nhad even the desperate hardihood to challenge their proofs; and even\nthe Bible itself was prohibited, with terrible denunciations, for the\ntriumphant reason that it was liable to be misinterpreted.\n\nIn the mean time, it became necessary to report to Don Augustin,\nthe effects his arguments and prayers had produced on the heretical\ndisposition of the young soldier. No man is prone to confess his\nweakness, at the very moment when circumstances demand the utmost\nefforts of his strength. By a species of pious fraud, for which no doubt\nthe worthy priest found his absolution in the purity of his motives, he\ndeclared that, while no positive change was actually wrought in the\nmind of Middleton, there was every reason to hope the entering wedge of\nargument had been driven to its head, and that in consequence an opening\nwas left, through which, it might rationally be hoped, the blessed seeds\nof a religious fructification would find their way, especially if the\nsubject was left uninterruptedly to enjoy the advantage of catholic\ncommunion.\n\nDon Augustin himself was now seized with the desire of proselyting. Even\nthe soft and amiable Inez thought it would be a glorious consummation\nof her wishes, to be a humble instrument of bringing her lover into\nthe bosom of the true church. The offers of Middleton were promptly\naccepted, and, while the father looked forward impatiently to the day\nassigned for the nuptials, as to the pledge of his own success, the\ndaughter thought of it with feelings in which the holy emotions of\nher faith were blended with the softer sensations of her years and\nsituation.\n\nThe sun rose, the morning of her nuptials, on a day so bright and\ncloudless, that Inez hailed it as a harbinger of future happiness.\nFather Ignatius performed the offices of the church, in a little chapel\nattached to the estate of Don Augustin; and long ere the sun had begun\nto fall, Middleton pressed the blushing and timid young Creole to his\nbosom, his acknowledged and unalienable wife. It had pleased the parties\nto pass the day of the wedding in retirement, dedicating it solely\nto the best and purest affections, aloof from the noisy and heartless\nrejoicings of a compelled festivity.\n\nMiddleton was returning through the grounds of Don Augustin, from a\nvisit of duty to his encampment, at that hour in which the light of\nthe sun begins to melt into the shadows of evening, when a glimpse of\na robe, similar to that in which Inez had accompanied him to the altar,\ncaught his eye through the foliage of a retired arbour. He approached\nthe spot, with a delicacy that was rather increased than diminished by\nthe claim she had perhaps given him to intrude on her private moments;\nbut the sounds of her soft voice, which was offering up prayers,\nin which he heard himself named by the dearest of all appellations,\novercame his scruples, and induced him to take a position where he might\nlisten without the fear of detection. It was certainly grateful to the\nfeelings of a husband to be able in this manner to lay bare the spotless\nsoul of his wife, and to find that his own image lay enshrined amid its\npurest and holiest aspirations. His self-esteem was too much flattered\nnot to induce him to overlook the immediate object of the petitioner.\nWhile she prayed that she might become the humble instrument of bringing\nhim into the flock of the faithful, she petitioned for forgiveness, on\nher own behalf, if presumption or indifference to the counsel of the\nchurch had caused her to set too high a value on her influence, and led\nher into the dangerous error of hazarding her own soul by espousing a\nheretic. There was so much of fervent piety, mingled with so strong a\nburst of natural feeling, so much of the woman blended with the angel,\nin her prayers, that Middleton could have forgiven her, had she termed\nhim a Pagan, for the sweetness and interest with which she petitioned in\nhis favour.\n\nThe young man waited until his bride arose from her knees, and then he\njoined her, as if entirely ignorant of what had occurred.\n\n\"It is getting late, my Inez,\" he said, \"and Don Augustin would be apt\nto reproach you with inattention to your health, in being abroad at such\nan hour. What then am I to do, who am charged with all his authority,\nand twice his love?\"\n\n\"Be like him in every thing,\" she answered, looking up in his face, with\ntears in her eyes, and speaking with emphasis; \"in every thing. Imitate\nmy father, Middleton, and I can ask no more of you.\"\n\n\"Nor for me, Inez? I doubt not that I should be all you can wish, were\nI to become as good as the worthy and respectable Don Augustin. But you\nare to make some allowances for the infirmities and habits of a soldier.\nNow let us go and join this excellent father.\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said his bride, gently extricating herself from the arm, that\nhe had thrown around her slight form, while he urged her from the place.\n\"I have still another duty to perform, before I can submit so implicitly\nto your orders, soldier though you are. I promised the worthy Inesella,\nmy faithful nurse, she who, as you heard, has so long been a mother to\nme, Middleton--I promised her a visit at this hour. It is the last,\nas she thinks, that she can receive from her own child, and I cannot\ndisappoint her. Go you then to Don Augustin; in one short hour I will\nrejoin you.\"\n\n\"Remember it is but an hour!\"\n\n\"One hour,\" repeated Inez, as she kissed her hand to him; and then\nblushing, ashamed at her own boldness, she darted from the arbour, and\nwas seen for an instant gliding towards the cottage of her nurse, in\nwhich, at the next moment, she disappeared.\n\nMiddleton returned slowly and thoughtfully to the house, often bending\nhis eyes in the direction in which he had last seen his wife, as if he\nwould fain trace her lovely form, in the gloom of the evening, still\nfloating through the vacant space. Don Augustin received him with\nwarmth, and for many minutes his mind was amused by relating to his new\nkinsman plans for the future. The exclusive old Spaniard listened to\nhis glowing but true account of the prosperity and happiness of those\nStates, of which he had been an ignorant neighbour half his life, partly\nin wonder, and partly with that sort of incredulity with which one\nattends to what he fancies are the exaggerated descriptions of a too\npartial friendship.\n\nIn this manner the hour for which Inez had conditioned passed away, much\nsooner than her husband could have thought possible, in her absence. At\nlength his looks began to wander to the clock, and then the minutes were\ncounted, as one rolled by after another and Inez did not appear. The\nhand had already made half of another circuit, around the face of the\ndial, when Middleton arose and announced his determination to go and\noffer himself, as an escort to the absentee. He found the night dark,\nand the heavens charged with threatening vapour, which in that climate\nwas the infallible forerunner of a gust. Stimulated no less by the\nunpropitious aspect of the skies, than by his secret uneasiness, he\nquickened his pace, making long and rapid strides in the direction\nof the cottage of Inesella. Twenty times he stopped, fancying that he\ncaught glimpses of the fairy form of Inez, tripping across the grounds,\non her return to the mansion-house, and as often he was obliged to\nresume his course, in disappointment. He reached the gate of the\ncottage, knocked, opened the door, entered, and even stood in the\npresence of the aged nurse, without meeting the person of her he sought.\nShe had already left the place, on her return to her father's house!\nBelieving that he must have passed her in the darkness, Middleton\nretraced his steps to meet with another disappointment. Inez had\nnot been seen. Without communicating his intention to any one, the\nbridegroom proceeded with a palpitating heart to the little sequestered\narbour, where he had overheard his bride offering up those petitions for\nhis happiness and conversion. Here, too, he was disappointed; and then\nall was afloat, in the painful incertitude of doubt and conjecture.\n\nFor many hours, a secret distrust of the motives of his wife caused\nMiddleton to proceed in the search with delicacy and caution. But as day\ndawned, without restoring her to the arms of her father or her husband,\nreserve was thrown aside, and her unaccountable absence was loudly\nproclaimed. The enquiries after the lost Inez were now direct and open;\nbut they proved equally fruitless. No one had seen her, or heard of her,\nfrom the moment that she left the cottage of her nurse.\n\nDay succeeded day, and still no tidings rewarded the search that was\nimmediately instituted, until she was finally given over, by most of her\nrelations and friends, as irretrievably lost.\n\nAn event of so extraordinary a character was not likely to be soon\nforgotten. It excited speculation, gave rise to an infinity of rumours,\nand not a few inventions. The prevalent opinion, among such of those\nemigrants who were over-running the country, as had time, in the\nmultitude of their employments, to think of any foreign concerns, was\nthe simple and direct conclusion that the absent bride was no more nor\nless than a felo de se. Father Ignatius had many doubts, and much secret\ncompunction of conscience; but, like a wise chief, he endeavoured to\nturn the sad event to some account, in the impending warfare of faith.\nChanging his battery, he whispered in the ears of a few of his oldest\nparishioners, that he had been deceived in the state of Middleton's\nmind, which he was now compelled to believe was completely stranded on\nthe quicksands of heresy. He began to show his relics again, and was\neven heard to allude once more to the delicate and nearly forgotten\nsubject of modern miracles. In consequence of these demonstrations,\non the part of the venerable priest, it came to be whispered among the\nfaithful, and finally it was adopted, as part of the parish creed, that\nInez had been translated to heaven.\n\nDon Augustin had all the feelings of a father, but they were smothered\nin the lassitude of a Creole. Like his spiritual governor, he began to\nthink that they had been wrong in consigning one so pure, so young, so\nlovely, and above all so pious, to the arms of a heretic: and he was\nfain to believe that the calamity, which had befallen his age, was a\njudgment on his presumption and want of adherence to established forms.\nIt is true that, as the whispers of the congregation came to his ears,\nhe found present consolation in their belief; but then nature was too\npowerful, and had too strong a hold of the old man's heart, not to give\nrise to the rebellious thought, that the succession of his daughter to\nthe heavenly inheritance was a little premature.\n\nBut Middleton, the lover, the husband, the bridegroom--Middleton was\nnearly crushed by the weight of the unexpected and terrible blow.\nEducated himself under the dominion of a simple and rational faith, in\nwhich nothing is attempted to be concealed from the believers, he could\nhave no other apprehensions for the fate of Inez than such as grew out\nof his knowledge of the superstitious opinions she entertained of his\nown church. It is needless to dwell on the mental tortures that he\nendured, or all the various surmises, hopes, and disappointments, that\nhe was fated to experience in the first few weeks of his misery. A\njealous distrust of the motives of Inez, and a secret, lingering, hope\nthat he should yet find her, had tempered his enquiries, without however\ncausing him to abandon them entirely. But time was beginning to deprive\nhim, even of the mortifying reflection that he was intentionally, though\nperhaps temporarily, deserted, and he was gradually yielding to the\nmore painful conviction that she was dead, when his hopes were suddenly\nrevived, in a new and singular manner.\n\nThe young commander was slowly and sorrowfully returning from an evening\nparade of his troops, to his own quarters, which stood at some little\ndistance from the place of the encampment, and on the same high bluff\nof land, when his vacant eyes fell on the figure of a man, who by\nthe regulations of the place, was not entitled to be there, at that\nforbidden hour. The stranger was meanly dressed, with every appearance\nabout his person and countenance, of squalid poverty and of the most\ndissolute habits. Sorrow had softened the military pride of Middleton,\nand, as he passed the crouching form of the intruder, he said, in tones\nof great mildness, or rather of kindness--\n\n\"You will be given a night in the guard-house, friend, should the patrol\nfind you here;--there is a dollar,--go, and get a better place to sleep\nin, and something to eat!\"\n\n\"I swallow all my food, captain, without chewing,\" returned the\nvagabond, with the low exultation of an accomplished villain, as he\neagerly seized the silver. \"Make this Mexican twenty, and I will sell\nyou a secret.\"\n\n\"Go, go,\" said the other with a little of a soldier's severity,\nreturning to his manner. \"Go, before I order the guard to seize you.\"\n\n\"Well, go I will;--but if I do go, captain, I shall take my knowledge\nwith me; and then you may live a widower bewitched till the tattoo of\nlife is beat off.\"\n\n\"What mean you, fellow?\" exclaimed Middleton, turning quickly towards\nthe wretch, who was already dragging his diseased limbs from the place.\n\n\"I mean to have the value of this dollar in Spanish brandy, and then\ncome back and sell you my secret for enough to buy a barrel.\"\n\n\"If you have any thing to say, speak now,\" continued Middleton,\nrestraining with difficulty the impatience that urged him to betray his\nfeelings.\n\n\"I am a-dry, and I can never talk with elegance when my throat is husky,\ncaptain. How much will you give to know what I can tell you; let it be\nsomething handsome; such as one gentleman can offer to another.\"\n\n\"I believe it would be better justice to order the drummer to pay you a\nvisit, fellow. To what does your boasted secret relate?\"\n\n\"Matrimony; a wife and no wife; a pretty face and a rich bride: do I\nspeak plain, now, captain?\"\n\n\"If you know any thing relating to my wife, say it at once; you need not\nfear for your reward.\"\n\n\"Ay, captain, I have drove many a bargain in my time, and sometimes I\nhave been paid in money, and sometimes I have been paid in promises; now\nthe last are what I call pinching food.\"\n\n\"Name your price.\"\n\n\"Twenty--no, damn it, it's worth thirty dollars, if it's worth a cent!\"\n\n\"Here, then, is your money: but remember, if you tell me nothing worth\nknowing, I have a force that can easily deprive you of it again, and\npunish your insolence in the bargain.\"\n\nThe fellow examined the bank-bills he received, with a jealous eye, and\nthen pocketed them, apparently well satisfied of their being genuine.\n\n\"I like a northern note,\" he said very coolly; \"they have a character\nto lose like myself. No fear of me, captain; I am a man of honour, and\nI shall not tell you a word more, nor a word less than I know of my own\nknowledge to be true.\"\n\n\"Proceed then without further delay, or I may repent, and order you to\nbe deprived of all your gains; the silver as well as the notes.\"\n\n\"Honour, if you die for it!\" returned the miscreant, holding up a hand\nin affected horror at so treacherous a threat. \"Well, captain, you must\nknow that gentlemen don't all live by the same calling; some keep what\nthey've got, and some get what they can.\"\n\n\"You have been a thief.\"\n\n\"I scorn the word. I have been a humanity hunter. Do you know what\nthat means? Ay, it has many interpretations. Some people think the\nwoolly-heads are miserable, working on hot plantations under a broiling\nsun--and all such sorts of inconveniences. Well, captain, I have been,\nin my time, a man who has been willing to give them the pleasures of\nvariety, at least, by changing the scene for them. You understand me?\"\n\n\"You are, in plain language, a kidnapper.\"\n\n\"Have been, my worthy captain--have been; but just now a little reduced,\nlike a merchant who leaves off selling tobacco by the hogshead, to deal\nin it by the yard. I have been a soldier, too, in my day. What is said\nto be the great secret of our trade, can you tell me that?\"\n\n\"I know not,\" said Middleton, beginning to tire of the fellow's\ntrifling: \"courage?\"\n\n\"No, legs--legs to fight with, and legs to run away with--and therein\nyou see my two callings agreed. My legs are none of the best just now,\nand without legs a kidnapper would carry on a losing trade; but then\nthere are men enough left, better provided than I am.\"\n\n\"Stolen!\" groaned the horror-struck husband.\n\n\"On her travels, as sure as you are standing still!\"\n\n\"Villain, what reason have you for believing a thing so shocking?\"\n\n\"Hands off--hands off--do you think my tongue can do its work the\nbetter, for a little squeezing of the throat! Have patience, and you\nshall know it all; but if you treat me so ungenteelly again, I shall be\nobliged to call in the assistance of the lawyers.\"\n\n\"Say on; but if you utter a single word more or less than the truth,\nexpect instant vengeance!\"\n\n\"Are you fool enough to believe what such a scoundrel as I am tells\nyou, captain, unless it has probability to back it? I know you are not:\ntherefore I will give my facts and my opinions, and then leave you to\nchew on them, while I go and drink of your generosity. I know a man who\nis called Abiram White.--I believe the knave took that name to show his\nenmity to the race of blacks! But this gentleman is now, and has been\nfor years, to my certain knowledge, a regular translator of the human\nbody from one State to another. I have dealt with him in my time, and a\ncheating dog he is! No more honour in him than meat in my stomach. I saw\nhim here in this very town, the day of your wedding. He was in company\nwith his wife's brother, and pretended to be a settler on the hunt for\nnew land. A noble set they were, to carry on business--seven sons, each\nof them as tall as your sergeant with his cap on. Well, the moment I\nheard that your wife was lost, I saw at once that Abiram had laid his\nhands on her.\"\n\n\"Do you know this--can this be true? What reason have you to fancy a\nthing so wild?\"\n\n\"Reason enough; I know Abiram White. Now, will you add a trifle just to\nkeep my throat from parching?\"\n\n\"Go, go; you are stupified with drink already, miserable man, and know\nnot what you say. Go; go, and beware the drummer.\"\n\n\"Experience is a good guide\"--the fellow called after the retiring\nMiddleton; and then turning with a chuckling laugh, like one well\nsatisfied with himself, he made the best of his way towards the shop of\nthe suttler.\n\nA hundred times in the course of that night did Middleton fancy that the\ncommunication of the miscreant was entitled to some attention, and\nas often did he reject the idea as too wild and visionary for another\nthought. He was awakened early on the following morning, after passing a\nrestless and nearly sleepless night, by his orderly, who came to report\nthat a man was found dead on the parade, at no great distance from his\nquarters. Throwing on his clothes he proceeded to the spot, and beheld\nthe individual, with whom he had held the preceding conference, in the\nprecise situation in which he had first been found.\n\nThe miserable wretch had fallen a victim to his intemperance. This\nrevolting fact was sufficiently proclaimed by his obtruding eye-balls,\nhis bloated countenance, and the nearly insufferable odours that\nwere even then exhaling from his carcass. Disgusted with the odious\nspectacle, the youth was turning from the sight, after ordering the\ncorpse to be removed, when the position of one of the dead man's hands\nstruck him. On examination, he found the fore-finger extended, as if in\nthe act of writing in the sand, with the following incomplete sentence,\nnearly illegible, but yet in a state to be deciphered: \"Captain, it is\ntrue, as I am a gentle--\" He had either died, or fallen into a sleep,\nthe forerunner of his death, before the latter word was finished.\n\nConcealing this fact from the others, Middleton repeated his orders and\ndeparted. The pertinacity of the deceased, and all the circumstances\nunited, induced him to set on foot some secret enquiries. He found that\na family answering the description which had been given him, had in fact\npassed the place the day of his nuptials. They were traced along the\nmargin of the Mississippi, for some distance, until they took boat and\nascended the river to its confluence with the Missouri. Here they had\ndisappeared like hundreds of others, in pursuit of the hidden wealth of\nthe interior.\n\nFurnished with these facts, Middleton detailed a small guard of his most\ntrusty men, took leave of Don Augustin, without declaring his hopes or\nhis fears, and having arrived at the indicated point, he pushed into the\nwilderness in pursuit. It was not difficult to trace a train like that\nof Ishmael, until he was well assured its object lay far beyond the\nusual limits of the settlements. This circumstance, in itself, quickened\nhis suspicions, and gave additional force to his hopes of final success.\n\nAfter getting beyond the assistance of verbal directions, the anxious\nhusband had recourse to the usual signs of a trail, in order to follow\nthe fugitives. This he also found a task of no difficulty, until he\nreached the hard and unyielding soil of the rolling prairies. Here,\nindeed, he was completely at fault. He found himself, at length,\ncompelled to divide his followers, appointing a place of rendezvous at a\ndistant day, and to endeavour to find the lost trail by multiplying, as\nmuch as possible, the number of his eyes. He had been alone a week, when\naccident brought him in contact with the trapper and the bee-hunter.\nPart of their interview has been related, and the reader can readily\nimagine the explanations that succeeded the tale he recounted, and which\nled, as has already been seen, to the recovery of his bride.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n           These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence,\n           Therefore, I pray you, stay not to discourse,\n           But mount you presently.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nAn hour had slid by, in hasty and nearly incoherent questions and\nanswers, before Middleton, hanging over his recovered treasure with that\nsort of jealous watchfulness with which a miser would regard his hoards,\nclosed the disjointed narrative of his own proceedings by demanding--\n\n\"And you, my Inez; in what manner were you treated?\"\n\n\"In every thing, but the great injustice they did in separating me so\nforcibly from my friends, as well perhaps as the circumstances of my\ncaptors would allow. I think the man, who is certainly the master here,\nis but a new beginner in wickedness. He quarrelled frightfully in my\npresence, with the wretch who seized me, and then they made an impious\nbargain, to which I was compelled to acquiesce, and to which they bound\nme as well as themselves by oaths. Ah! Middleton, I fear the heretics\nare not so heedful of their vows as we who are nurtured in the bosom of\nthe true church!\"\n\n\"Believe it not; these villains are of no religion: did they forswear\nthemselves?\"\n\n\"No, not perjured: but was it not awful to call upon the good God to\nwitness so sinful a compact?\"\n\n\"And so we think, Inez, as truly as the most virtuous cardinal of Rome.\nBut how did they observe their oath, and what was its purport?\"\n\n\"They conditioned to leave me unmolested, and free from their odious\npresence, provided I would give a pledge to make no effort to escape;\nand that I would not even show myself, until a time that my masters saw\nfit to name.\"\n\n\"And that time?\" demanded the impatient Middleton, who so well knew the\nreligious scruples of his wife--\"that time?\"\n\n\"It is already passed. I was sworn by my patron saint, and faithfully\ndid I keep the vow, until the man they call Ishmael forgot the terms by\noffering violence. I then made my appearance on the rock, for the time\ntoo was passed; though I even think father Ignatius would have absolved\nme from the vow, on account of the treachery of my keepers.\"\n\n\"If he had not,\" muttered the youth between his compressed teeth,\n\"I would have absolved him for ever from his spiritual care of your\nconscience!\"\n\n\"You, Middleton!\" returned his wife looking up into his flushed face,\nwhile a bright blush suffused her own sweet countenance; \"you may\nreceive my vows, but surely you can have no power to absolve me from\ntheir observance!\"\n\n\"No, no, no. Inez, you are right. I know but little of these\nconscientious subtilties, and I am any thing but a priest: yet tell me,\nwhat has induced these monsters to play this desperate game--to trifle\nthus with my happiness?\"\n\n\"You know my ignorance of the world, and how ill I am qualified to\nfurnish reasons for the conduct of beings so different from any I have\never seen before. But does not love of money drive men to acts even\nworse than this? I believe they thought that an aged and wealthy father\ncould be tempted to pay them a rich ransom for his child; and, perhaps,\"\nshe added, stealing an enquiring glance through her tears, at the\nattentive Middleton, \"they counted something on the fresh affections of\na bridegroom.\"\n\n\"They might have extracted the blood from my heart, drop by drop!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" resumed his young and timid wife, instantly withdrawing the\nstolen look she had hazarded, and hurriedly pursuing the train of the\ndiscourse, as if glad to make him forget the liberty she had just taken,\n\"I have been told, there are men so base as to perjure themselves at the\naltar, in order to command the gold of ignorant and confiding girls;\nand if love of money will lead to such baseness, we may surely expect\nit will hurry those, who devote themselves to gain, into acts of lesser\nfraud.\"\n\n\"It must be so; and now, Inez, though I am here to guard you with my\nlife, and we are in possession of this rock, our difficulties, perhaps\nour dangers, are not ended. You will summon all your courage to meet the\ntrial and prove yourself a soldier's wife, my Inez?\"\n\n\"I am ready to depart this instant. The letter you sent by the\nphysician, had prepared me to hope for the best, and I have every thing\narranged for flight, at the shortest warning.\"\n\n\"Let us then leave this place and join our friends.\"\n\n\"Friends!\" interrupted Inez, glancing her eyes around the little tent\nin quest of the form of Ellen. \"I, too, have a friend who must not be\nforgotten, but who is pledged to pass the remainder of her life with us.\nShe is gone!\"\n\nMiddleton gently led her from the spot, as he smilingly answered--\n\n\"She may have had, like myself, her own private communications for some\nfavoured ear.\"\n\nThe young man had not however done justice to the motives of Ellen Wade.\nThe sensitive and intelligent girl had readily perceived how little her\npresence was necessary in the interview that has just been related,\nand had retired with that intuitive delicacy of feeling which seems\nto belong more properly to her sex. She was now to be seen seated on a\npoint of the rock, with her person so entirely enveloped in her dress as\nto conceal her features. Here she had remained for near an hour, no\none approaching to address her, and as it appeared to her own quick and\njealous eyes, totally unobserved. In the latter particular, however,\neven the vigilance of the quick-sighted Ellen was deceived.\n\nThe first act of Paul Hover, on finding himself the master of Ishmael's\ncitadel, had been to sound the note of victory, after the quaint and\nludicrous manner that is so often practised among the borderers of the\nWest. Flapping his sides with his hands, as the conquering game-cock is\nwont to do with his wings, he raised a loud and laughable imitation of\nthe exultation of this bird; a cry which might have proved a dangerous\nchallenge had any one of the athletic sons of the squatter been within\nhearing.\n\n\"This has been a regular knock-down and drag-out,\" he cried, \"and no\nbones broke! How now, old trapper, you have been one of your training,\nplatoon, rank and file soldiers in your day, and have seen forts taken\nand batteries stormed before this--am I right?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, that have I,\" answered the old man, who still maintained his\npost at the foot of the rock, so little disturbed by what he had just\nwitnessed, as to return the grin of Paul, with a hearty indulgence in\nhis own silent and peculiar laughter; \"you have gone through the exploit\nlike men!\"\n\n\"Now tell me, is it not in rule, to call over the names of the living,\nand to bury the dead, after every bloody battle?\"\n\n\"Some did and other some didn't. When Sir William push'd the German,\nDieskau, thro' the defiles at the foot of the Hori--\"\n\n\"Your Sir William was a drone to Sir Paul, and knew nothing of\nregularity. So here begins the roll-call--by the by, old man, what\nbetween bee-hunting and buffaloe humps, and certain other matters,\nI have been too busy to ask your name; for I intend to begin with my\nrear-guard, well knowing that my man in front is too busy to answer.\"\n\n\"Lord, lad, I've been called in my time by as many names as there are\npeople among whom I've dwelt. Now the Delawares nam'd me for my eyes,\nand I was called after the far-sighted hawk. Then, ag'in, the settlers\nin the Otsego hills christened me anew, from the fashion of my leggings;\nand various have been the names by which I have gone through life;\nbut little will it matter when the time shall come, that all are to be\nmuster'd, face to face, by what titles a mortal has played his part!\nI humbly trust I shall be able to answer to any of mine, in a loud and\nmanly voice.\"\n\nPaul paid little or no attention to this reply, more than half of which\nwas lost in the distance, but pursuing the humour of the moment, he\ncalled out in a stentorian voice to the naturalist to answer to his\nname. Dr. Battius had not thought it necessary to push his success\nbeyond the comfortable niche, which accident had so opportunely formed\nfor his protection, and in which he now reposed from his labours, with\na pleasing consciousness of security, added to great exultation at the\npossession of the botanical treasure already mentioned.\n\n\"Mount, mount, my worthy mole-catcher! come and behold the prospect of\nskirting Ishmael; come and look nature boldly in the face, and not go\nsneaking any longer, among the prairie grass and mullein tops, like a\ngobbler nibbling for grasshoppers.\"\n\nThe mouth of the light-hearted and reckless bee-hunter was instantly\nclosed, and he was rendered as mute, as he had just been boisterous and\ntalkative, by the appearance of Ellen Wade. When the melancholy maiden\ntook her seat on the point of the rock as mentioned, Paul affected to\nemploy himself in conducting a close inspection of the household effects\nof the squatter. He rummaged the drawers of Esther with no delicate\nhands, scattered the rustic finery of her girls on the ground, without\nthe least deference to its quality or elegance, and tossed her pots and\nkettles here and there, as though they had been vessels of wood instead\nof iron. All this industry was, however, manifestly without an object.\nHe reserved nothing for himself, not even appearing conscious of the\nnature of the articles which suffered by his familiarity. When he had\nexamined the inside of every cabin, taken a fresh survey of the spot\nwhere he had confined the children, and where he had thoroughly secured\nthem with cords, and kicked one of the pails of the woman, like a\nfoot-ball, fifty feet into the air, in sheer wantonness, he returned to\nthe edge of the rock, and thrusting both his hands through his wampum\nbelt, he began to whistle the \"Kentucky Hunters\" as diligently as if he\nhad been hired to supply his auditors with music by the hour. In this\nmanner passed the remainder of the time, until Middleton, as has been\nrelated, led Inez forth from the tent, and gave a new direction to\nthe thoughts of the whole party. He summoned Paul from his flourish of\nmusic, tore the Doctor from the study of his plant, and, as acknowledged\nleader, gave the necessary orders for immediate departure.\n\nIn the bustle and confusion that were likely to succeed such a mandate,\nthere was little opportunity to indulge in complaints or reflections.\nAs the adventurers had not come unprepared for victory, each individual\nemployed himself in such offices as were best adapted to his strength\nand situation. The trapper had already made himself master of the\npatient Asinus, who was quietly feeding at no great distance from the\nrock, and he was now busy in fitting his back with the complicated\nmachinery that Dr. Battius saw fit to term a saddle of his own\ninvention. The naturalist himself seized upon his portfolios, herbals,\nand collection of insects, which he quickly transferred from the\nencampment of the squatter, to certain pockets in the aforesaid\ningenious invention, and which the trapper as uniformly cast away the\nmoment his back was turned. Paul showed his dexterity in removing such\nlight articles as Inez and Ellen had prepared for their flight to\nthe foot of the citadel, while Middleton, after mingling threats and\npromises, in order to induce the children to remain quietly in their\nbondage, assisted the females to descend. As time began to press upon\nthem, and there was great danger of Ishmael's returning, these several\nmovements were made with singular industry and despatch.\n\nThe trapper bestowed such articles as he conceived were necessary to the\ncomfort of the weaker and more delicate members of the party, in those\npockets from which he had so unceremoniously expelled the treasures of\nthe unconscious naturalist, and then gave way for Middleton to place\nInez in one of those seats which he had prepared on the back of the\nanimal for her and her companion.\n\n\"Go, child,\" the old man said, motioning to Ellen to follow the example\nof the lady, and turning his head a little anxiously to examine the\nwaste behind him. \"It cannot be long afore the owner of this place will\nbe coming to look after his household; and he is not a man to give up\nhis property, however obtained, without complaint!\"\n\n\"It is true,\" cried Middleton; \"we have wasted moments that are\nprecious, and have the utmost need of industry.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, I thought it; and would have said it, captain; but I remembered\nhow your grand'ther used to love to look upon the face of her he led\naway for a wife, in the days of his youth and his happiness. 'Tis\nnatur', 'tis natur', and 'tis wiser to give way a little before its\nfeelings, than to try to stop a current that will have its course.\"\n\nEllen advanced to the side of the beast, and seizing Inez by the hand,\nshe said, with heartfelt warmth, after struggling to suppress an emotion\nthat nearly choked her--\n\n\"God bless you, sweet lady! I hope you will forget and forgive the\nwrongs you have received from my uncle--\"\n\nThe humbled and sorrowful girl could say no more, her voice becoming\nentirely inaudible in an ungovernable burst of grief.\n\n\"How is this?\" cried Middleton; \"did you not say, Inez, that this\nexcellent young woman was to accompany us, and to live with us for the\nremainder of her life; or, at least, until she found some more agreeable\nresidence for herself?\"\n\n\"I did; and I still hope it. She has always given me reason to believe,\nthat after having shown so much commiseration and friendship in my\nmisery, she would not desert me, should happier times return.\"\n\n\"I cannot--I ought not,\" continued Ellen, getting the better of her\nmomentary weakness. \"It has pleased God to cast my lot among these\npeople, and I ought not to quit them. It would be adding the appearance\nof treachery to what will already seem bad enough, with one of his\nopinions. He has been kind to me, an orphan, after his rough customs,\nand I cannot steal from him at such a moment.\"\n\n\"She is just as much a relation of skirting Ishmael as I am a bishop!\"\nsaid Paul, with a loud hem, as if his throat wanted clearing. \"If the\nold fellow has done the honest thing by her, in giving her a morsel of\nvenison now and then, or a spoon around his homminy dish, hasn't she\npay'd him in teaching the young devils to read their Bible, or in\nhelping old Esther to put her finery in shape and fashion. Tell me that\na drone has a sting, and I'll believe you as easily as I will that this\nyoung woman is a debtor to any of the tribe of Bush!\"\n\n\"It is but little matter who owes me, or where I am in debt. There are\nnone to care for a girl who is fatherless and motherless, and whose\nnearest kin are the offcasts of all honest people. No, no; go, lady, and\nHeaven for ever bless you! I am better here, in this desert, where there\nare none to know my shame.\"\n\n\"Now, old trapper,\" retorted Paul, \"this is what I call knowing which\nway the wind blows! You ar' a man that has seen life, and you know\nsomething of fashions; I put it to your judgment, plainly, isn't it\nin the nature of things for the hive to swarm when the young get their\ngrowth, and if children will quit their parents, ought one who is of no\nkith or kin--\"\n\n\"Hist!\" interrupted the man he addressed, \"Hector is discontented. Say\nit out, plainly, pup; what is it dog--what is it?\"\n\nThe venerable hound had risen, and was scenting the fresh breeze which\ncontinued to sweep heavily over the prairie. At the words of his master\nhe growled and contracted the muscles of his lips, as if half disposed\nto threaten with the remnants of his teeth. The younger dog, who was\nresting after the chase of the morning, also made some signs that\nhis nose detected a taint in the air, and then the two resumed their\nslumbers, as if they had done enough.\n\nThe trapper seized the bridle of the ass, and cried, urging the beast\nonward--\n\n\"There is no time for words. The squatter and his brood are within a\nmile or two of this blessed spot!\"\n\nMiddleton lost all recollection of Ellen, in the danger which now so\neminently beset his recovered bride; nor is it necessary to add,\nthat Dr. Battius did not wait for a second admonition to commence his\nretreat.\n\nFollowing the route indicated by the old man, they turned the rock in\na body, and pursued their way as fast as possible across the prairie,\nunder the favour of the cover it afforded.\n\nPaul Hover, however, remained in his tracks, sullenly leaning on his\nrifle. Near a minute had elapsed before he was observed by Ellen, who\nhad buried her face in her hands, to conceal her fancied desolation from\nherself.\n\n\"Why do you not fly?\" the weeping girl exclaimed, the instant she\nperceived she was not alone.\n\n\"I'm not used to it.\"\n\n\"My uncle will soon be here! you have nothing to hope from his pity.\"\n\n\"Nor from that of his niece, I reckon. Let him come; he can only knock\nme on the head!\"\n\n\"Paul, Paul, if you love me, fly.\"\n\n\"Alone!--if I do, may I be--\"\n\n\"If you value your life, fly!\"\n\n\"I value it not, compared to you.\"\n\n\"Paul!\"\n\n\"Ellen!\"\n\nShe extended both her hands and burst into another and a still more\nviolent flood of tears. The bee-hunter put one of his sturdy arms around\nher waist, and in another moment he was urging her over the plain, in\nrapid pursuit of their flying friends.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n             Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight\n             With a new Gorgon--Do not bid me speak;\n             See, and then speak yourselves.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nThe little run, which supplied the family of the squatter with water,\nand nourished the trees and bushes that grew near the base of the rocky\neminence, took its rise at no great distance from the latter, in a small\nthicket of cotton-wood and vines. Hither, then, the trapper directed\nthe flight, as to the place affording the only available cover in so\npressing an emergency. It will be remembered, that the sagacity of the\nold man, which, from long practice in similar scenes, amounted nearly to\nan instinct in all cases of sudden danger, had first induced him to\ntake this course, as it placed the hill between them and the approaching\nparty. Favoured by this circumstance, he succeeded in reaching the\nbushes in sufficient time and Paul Hover had just hurried the breathless\nEllen into the tangled bush, as Ishmael gained the summit of the rock,\nin the manner already described, where he stood like a man momentarily\nbereft of sense, gazing at the confusion which had been created among\nhis chattels, or at his gagged and bound children, who had been safely\nbestowed, by the forethought of the bee-hunter, under the cover of a\nbark roof, in a sort of irregular pile. A long rifle would have thrown\na bullet from the height, on which the squatter now stood, into the\nvery cover where the fugitives, who had wrought all this mischief, were\nclustered.\n\nThe trapper was the first to speak, as the man on whose intelligence and\nexperience they all depended for counsel, after running his eye over the\ndifferent individuals who gathered about him, in order to see that none\nwere missing.\n\n\"Ah! natur' is natur', and has done its work!\" he said, nodding to the\nexulting Paul, with a smile of approbation. \"I thought it would be hard\nfor those, who had so often met in fair and foul, by starlight and under\nthe clouded moon, to part at last in anger. Now is there little time\nto lose in talk, and every thing to gain by industry! It cannot be long\nafore some of yonder brood will be nosing along the 'arth for our trail,\nand should they find it, as find it they surely will, and should they\npush us to a stand on our courage, the dispute must be settled with the\nrifle; which may He in heaven forbid! Captain, can you lead us to\nthe place where any of your warriors lie?--For the stout sons of the\nsquatter will make a manly brush of it, or I am but little of a judge in\nwarlike dispositions!\"\n\n\"The place of rendezvous is many leagues from this, on the banks of La\nPlatte.\"\n\n\"It is bad--it is bad. If fighting is to be done, it is always wise to\nenter on it on equal terms. But what has one so near his time to do with\nill-blood and hot-blood at his heart! Listen to what a grey head and\nsome experience have to offer, and then if any among you can point out\na wiser fashion for a retreat, we can just follow his design, and forget\nthat I have spoken. This thicket stretches for near a mile as it may\nbe slanting from the rock, and leads towards the sunset instead of the\nsettlements.\"\n\n\"Enough, enough,\" cried Middleton, too impatient to wait until the\ndeliberative and perhaps loquacious old man could end his minute\nexplanation. \"Time is too precious for words. Let us fly.\"\n\nThe trapper made a gesture of compliance, and turning in his tracks, he\nled Asinus across the trembling earth of the swale, and quickly emerged\non the hard ground, on the side opposite to the encampment of the\nsquatter.\n\n\"If old Ishmael gets a squint at that highway through the brush,\" cried\nPaul, casting, as he left the place, a hasty glance at the broad trail\nthe party had made through the thicket, \"he'll need no finger-board\nto tell him which way his road lies. But let him follow! I know the\nvagabond would gladly cross his breed with a little honest blood, but if\nany son of his ever gets to be the husband of--\"\n\n\"Hush, Paul, hush,\" said the terrified young woman, who leaned on his\narm for support; \"your voice might be heard.\"\n\nThe bee-hunter was silent, though he did not cease to cast ominous looks\nbehind him, as they flew along the edge of the run, which sufficiently\nbetrayed the belligerent condition of his mind. As each one was busy for\nhimself, but a few minutes elapsed before the party rose a swell of the\nprairie, and descending without a moment's delay on the opposite side,\nthey were at once removed from every danger of being seen by the sons of\nIshmael, unless the pursuers should happen to fall upon their trail.\nThe old man now profited by the formation of the land to take another\ndirection, with a view to elude pursuit, as a vessel changes her course\nin fogs and darkness, to escape from the vigilance of her enemies.\n\nTwo hours, passed in the utmost diligence, enabled them to make a half\ncircuit around the rock, and to reach a point that was exactly opposite\nto the original direction of their flight. To most of the fugitives\ntheir situation was as entirely unknown as is that of a ship in the\nmiddle of the ocean to the uninstructed voyager: but the old man\nproceeded at every turn, and through every bottom, with a decision that\ninspired his followers with confidence, as it spoke favourably of his\nown knowledge of the localities. His hound, stopping now and then to\ncatch the expression of his eye, had preceded the trapper throughout\nthe whole distance, with as much certainty as though a previous and\nintelligible communion between them had established the route by which\nthey were to proceed. But, at the expiration of the time just named, the\ndog suddenly came to a stand, and then seating himself on the prairie,\nhe snuffed the air a moment, and began a low and piteous whining.\n\n\"Ay--pup--ay. I know the spot--I know the spot, and reason there is to\nremember it well!\" said the old man, stopping by the side of his uneasy\nassociate, until those who followed had time to come up. \"Now, yonder,\nis a thicket before us,\" he continued, pointing forward, \"where we\nmay lie till tall trees grow on these naked fields, afore any of the\nsquatter's kin will venture to molest us.\"\n\n\"This is the spot, where the body of the dead man lay!\" cried Middleton,\nexamining the place with an eye that revolted at the recollection.\n\n\"The very same. But whether his friends have put him in the bosom of the\nground or not, remains to be seen. The hound knows the scent, but\nseems to be a little at a loss, too. It is therefore necessary that you\nadvance, friend bee-hunter, to examine, while I tarry to keep the dogs\nfrom complaining in too loud a voice.\"\n\n\"I!\" exclaimed Paul, thrusting his hand into his shaggy locks, like one\nwho thought it prudent to hesitate before he undertook so formidable\nan adventure; \"now, heark'ee, old trapper; I've stood in my thinnest\ncottons in the midst of many a swarm that has lost its queen-bee,\nwithout winking, and let me tell you, the man who can do that, is not\nlikely to fear any living son of skirting Ishmael; but as to meddling\nwith dead men's bones, why it is neither my calling nor my inclination;\nso, after thanking you for the favour of your choice, as they say, when\nthey make a man a corporal in Kentucky, I decline serving.\"\n\nThe old man turned a disappointed look towards Middleton, who was too\nmuch occupied in solacing Inez to observe his embarrassment, which\nwas, however, suddenly relieved from a quarter, whence, from previous\ncircumstances, there was little reason to expect such a demonstration of\nfortitude.\n\nDoctor Battius had rendered himself a little remarkable throughout the\nwhole of the preceding retreat, for the exceeding diligence with which\nhe had laboured to effect that desirable object. So very conspicuous\nwas his zeal, indeed, as to have entirely gotten the better of all his\nordinary predilections. The worthy naturalist belonged to that species\nof discoverers, who make the worst possible travelling companions to a\nman who has reason to be in a hurry. No stone, no bush, no plant is ever\nsuffered to escape the examination of their vigilant eyes, and thunder\nmay mutter, and rain fall, without disturbing the abstraction of their\nreveries. Not so, however, with the disciple of Linnaeus, during the\nmomentous period that it remained a mooted point at the tribunal of his\nbetter judgment, whether the stout descendants of the squatter were\nnot likely to dispute his right to traverse the prairie in freedom. The\nhighest blooded and best trained hound, with his game in view, could not\nhave run with an eye more riveted than that with which the Doctor had\npursued his curvilinear course. It was perhaps lucky for his fortitude\nthat he was ignorant of the artifice of the trapper in leading them\naround the citadel of Ishmael, and that he had imbibed the soothing\nimpression that every inch of prairie he traversed was just so much\nadded to the distance between his own person and the detested rock.\nNotwithstanding the momentary shock he certainly experienced, when he\ndiscovered this error, he now boldly volunteered to enter the thicket\nin which there was some reason to believe the body of the murdered Asa\nstill lay. Perhaps the naturalist was urged to show his spirit, on this\noccasion, by some secret consciousness that his excessive industry in\nthe retreat might be liable to misconstruction; and it is certain that,\nwhatever might be his peculiar notions of danger from the quick, his\nhabits and his knowledge had placed him far above the apprehension of\nsuffering harm from any communication with the dead.\n\n\"If there is any service to be performed, which requires the perfect\ncommand of the nervous system,\" said the man of science, with a look\nthat was slightly blustering, \"you have only to give a direction to his\nintellectual faculties, and here stands one on whose physical powers you\nmay depend.\"\n\n\"The man is given to speak in parables,\" muttered the single-minded\ntrapper; \"but I conclude there is always some meaning hidden in his\nwords, though it is as hard to find sense in his speeches, as to\ndiscover three eagles on the same tree. It will be wise, friend, to make\na cover, lest the sons of the squatter should be out skirting on our\ntrail, and, as you well know, there is some reason to fear yonder\nthicket contains a sight that may horrify a woman's mind. Are you man\nenough to look death in the face; or shall I run the risk of the hounds\nraising an outcry, and go in myself? You see the pup is willing to run\nwith an open mouth, already.\"\n\n\"Am I man enough! Venerable trapper, our communications have a recent\norigin, or thy interrogatory might have a tendency to embroil us\nin angry disputation. Am I man enough! I claim to be of the class,\nmammalia; order, primates; genus, homo! Such are my physical attributes;\nof my moral properties, let posterity speak; it becomes me to be mute.\"\n\n\"Physic may do for such as relish it; to my taste and judgment it is\nneither palatable nor healthy; but morals never did harm to any living\nmortal, be it that he was a sojourner in the forest, or a dweller in\nthe midst of glazed windows and smoking chimneys. It is only a few hard\nwords that divide us, friend; for I am of an opinion that, with use and\nfreedom, we should come to understand one another, and mainly settle\ndown into the same judgments of mankind, and of the ways of world.\nQuiet, Hector, quiet; what ruffles your temper, pup; is it not used to\nthe scent of human blood?\"\n\nThe Doctor bestowed a gracious but commiserating smile on the\nphilosopher of nature, as he retrograded a step or two from the place\nwhither he had been impelled by his excess of spirit, in order to reply\nwith less expenditure of breath, and with a greater freedom of air and\nattitude.\n\n\"A homo is certainly a homo,\" he said, stretching forth an arm in an\nargumentative manner; \"so far as the animal functions extend, there are\nthe connecting links of harmony, order, conformity, and design, between\nthe whole genus; but there the resemblance ends. Man may be degraded\nto the very margin of the line which separates him from the brute,\nby ignorance; or he may be elevated to a communion with the great\nMaster-spirit of all, by knowledge; nay, I know not, if time and\nopportunity were given him, but he might become the master of all\nlearning, and consequently equal to the great moving principle.\"\n\nThe old man, who stood leaning on his rifle in a thoughtful attitude,\nshook his head, as he answered with a native steadiness, that entirely\neclipsed the imposing air which his antagonist had seen fit to assume--\n\n\"This is neither more nor less than mortal wickedness! Here have I been\na dweller on the earth for four-score and six changes of the seasons,\nand all that time have I look'd at the growing and the dying trees, and\nyet do I not know the reasons why the bud starts under the summer sun,\nor the leaf falls when it is pinch'd by the frosts. Your l'arning,\nthough it is man's boast, is folly in the eyes of Him, who sits in\nthe clouds, and looks down, in sorrow, at the pride and vanity of his\ncreatur's. Many is the hour that I've passed, lying in the shades of the\nwoods, or stretch'd upon the hills of these open fields, looking up into\nthe blue skies, where I could fancy the Great One had taken his stand,\nand was solemnising on the waywardness of man and brute, below, as I\nmyself had often look'd at the ants tumbling over each other in their\neagerness, though in a way and a fashion more suited to His mightiness\nand power. Knowledge! It is his plaything. Say, you who think it so easy\nto climb into the judgment-seat above, can you tell me any thing of the\nbeginning and the end? Nay, you're a dealer in ailings and cures: what\nis life, and what is death? Why does the eagle live so long, and why is\nthe time of the butterfly so short? Tell me a simpler thing: why is this\nhound so uneasy, while you, who have passed your days in looking into\nbooks, can see no reason to be disturbed?\"\n\nThe Doctor, who had been a little astounded by the dignity and energy\nof the old man, drew a long breath, like a sullen wrestler who is just\nreleased from the throttling grasp of his antagonist, and seized on the\nopportunity of the pause to reply--\n\n\"It is his instinct.\"\n\n\"And what is the gift of instinct?\"\n\n\"An inferior gradation of reason. A sort of mysterious combination of\nthought and matter.\"\n\n\"And what is that which you call thought?\"\n\n\"Venerable venator, this is a method of reasoning which sets at nought\nthe uses of definitions, and such as I do assure you is not at all\ntolerated in the schools.\"\n\n\"Then is there more cunning in your schools than I had thought, for it\nis a certain method of showing them their vanity,\" returned the trapper,\nsuddenly abandoning a discussion, from which the naturalist was just\nbeginning to anticipate great delight, by turning to his dog, whose\nrestlessness he attempted to appease by playing with his ears. \"This is\nfoolish, Hector; more like an untrained pup than a sensible hound; one\nwho has got his education by hard experience, and not by nosing over the\ntrails of other dogs, as a boy in the settlements follows on the track\nof his masters, be it right or be it wrong. Well, friend; you who can\ndo so much, are you equal to looking into the thicket? or must I go in\nmyself?\"\n\nThe Doctor again assumed his air of resolution, and, without further\nparlance, proceeded to do as desired. The dogs were so far restrained,\nby the remonstrances of the old man, as to confine their noise to low\nbut often-repeated whinings. When they saw the naturalist advance, the\npup, however, broke through all restraint, and made a swift circuit\naround his person, scenting the earth as he proceeded, and then,\nreturning to his companion, he howled aloud.\n\n\"The squatter and his brood have left a strong scent on the earth,\"\nsaid the old man, watching as he spoke for some signal from his learned\npioneer to follow; \"I hope yonder school-bred man knows enough to\nremember the errand on which I have sent him.\"\n\nDoctor Battius had already disappeared in the bushes and the trapper was\nbeginning to betray additional evidences of impatience, when the person\nof the former was seen retiring from the thicket backwards, with his\nface fastened on the place he had just left, as if his look was bound in\nthe thraldom of some charm.\n\n\"Here is something skeery, by the wildness of the creatur's\ncountenance!\" exclaimed the old man relinquishing his hold of Hector,\nand moving stoutly to the side of the totally unconscious naturalist.\n\"How is it, friend; have you found a new leaf in your book of wisdom?\"\n\n\"It is a basilisk!\" muttered the Doctor, whose altered visage betrayed\nthe utter confusion which beset his faculties. \"An animal of the order,\nserpens. I had thought its attributes were fabulous, but mighty nature\nis equal to all that man can imagine!\"\n\n\"What is't? what is't? The snakes of the prairies are harmless, unless\nit be now and then an angered rattler and he always gives you notice\nwith his tail, afore he works his mischief with his fangs. Lord, Lord,\nwhat a humbling thing is fear! Here is one who in common delivers words\ntoo big for a humble mouth to hold, so much beside himself, that his\nvoice is as shrill as the whistle of the whip-poor-will! Courage!--what\nis it, man?--what is it?\"\n\n\"A prodigy! a lusus naturae! a monster, that nature has delighted to\nform, in order to exhibit her power! Never before have I witnessed such\nan utter confusion in her laws, or a specimen that so completely bids\ndefiance to the distinctions of class and genera. Let me record its\nappearance,\" fumbling for his tablets with hands that trembled too much\nto perform their office, \"while time and opportunity are allowed--eyes,\nenthralling; colour, various, complex, and profound--\"\n\n\"One would think the man was craz'd, with his enthralling looks and\npieball'd colours!\" interrupted the discontented trapper, who began to\ngrow a little uneasy that his party was all this time neglecting to seek\nthe protection of some cover. \"If there is a reptile in the brush, show\nme the creatur', and should it refuse to depart peaceably, why there\nmust be a quarrel for the possession of the place.\"\n\n\"There!\" said the Doctor, pointing into a dense mass of the thicket,\nto a spot within fifty feet of that where they both stood. The trapper\nturned his look, with perfect composure, in the required direction, but\nthe instant his practised glance met the object which had so utterly\nupset the philosophy of the naturalist, he gave a start himself, threw\nhis rifle rapidly forward, and as instantly recovered it, as if a second\nflash of thought convinced him he was wrong. Neither the instinctive\nmovement, nor the sudden recollection, was without a sufficient object.\nAt the very margin of the thicket, and in absolute contact with the\nearth, lay an animate ball, that might easily, by the singularity and\nfierceness of its aspect, have justified the disturbed condition of the\nnaturalist's mind. It were difficult to describe the shape or colours of\nthis extraordinary substance, except to say, in general terms, that\nit was nearly spherical, and exhibited all the hues of the rainbow,\nintermingled without reference to harmony, and without any very\nostensible design. The predominant hues were a black and a bright\nvermilion. With these, however, the several tints of white, yellow, and\ncrimson, were strangely and wildly blended. Had this been all, it would\nhave been difficult to have pronounced that the object was possessed of\nlife, for it lay motionless as any stone; but a pair of dark, glaring,\nand moving eyeballs which watched with jealousy the smallest movement\nof the trapper and his companion, sufficiently established the important\nfact of its possessing vitality.\n\n\"Your reptile is a scouter, or I'm no judge of Indian paints and Indian\ndeviltries!\" muttered the old man, dropping the butt of his weapon to\nthe ground, and gazing with a steady eye at the frightful object, as he\nleaned on its barrel, in an attitude of great composure. \"He wants\nto face us out of sight and reason, and make us think the head of a\nred-skin is a stone covered with the autumn leaf; or he has some other\ndevilish artifice in his mind!\"\n\n\"Is the animal human?\" demanded the Doctor, \"of the genus homo? I had\nfancied it a non-descript.\"\n\n\"It's as human, and as mortal too, as a warrior of these prairies is\never known to be. I have seen the time when a red-skin would have shown\na foolish daring to peep out of his ambushment in that fashion on a\nhunter I could name, but who is too old now, and too near his time, to\nbe any thing better than a miserable trapper. It will be well to speak\nto the imp, and to let him know he deals with men whose beards are\ngrown. Come forth from your cover, friend,\" he continued, in the\nlanguage of the extensive tribes of the Dahcotahs; \"there is room on the\nprairie for another warrior.\"\n\nThe eyes appeared to glare more fiercely than ever, but the mass which,\naccording to the trapper's opinion, was neither more nor less than a\nhuman head, shorn, as usual among the warriors of the west, of its hair,\nstill continued without motion, or any other sign of life.\n\n\"It is a mistake!\" exclaimed the doctor. \"The animal is not even of the\nclass, mammalia, much less a man.\"\n\n\"So much for your knowledge!\" returned the trapper, laughing with great\nexultation. \"So much for the l'arning of one who has look'd into so many\nbooks, that his eyes are not able to tell a moose from a wild-cat! Now\nmy Hector, here, is a dog of education after his fashion, and, though\nthe meanest primmer in the settlements would puzzle his information, you\ncould not cheat the hound in a matter like this. As you think the object\nno man, you shall see his whole formation, and then let an ignorant\nold trapper, who never willingly pass'd a day within reach of a\nspelling-book in his life, know by what name to call it. Mind, I mean no\nviolence; but just to start the devil from his ambushment.\"\n\nThe trapper very deliberately examined the priming of his rifle, taking\ncare to make as great a parade as possible of his hostile intentions, in\ngoing through the necessary evolutions with the weapon. When he thought\nthe stranger began to apprehend some danger, he very deliberately\npresented the piece, and called aloud--\n\n\"Now, friend, I am all for peace, or all for war, as you may say. No!\nwell it is no man, as the wiser one, here, says, and there can be no\nharm in just firing into a bunch of leaves.\"\n\nThe muzzle of the rifle fell as he concluded, and the weapon was\ngradually settling into a steady, and what would easily have proved a\nfatal aim, when a tall Indian sprang from beneath that bed of leaves and\nbrush, which he had collected about his person at the approach of the\nparty, and stood upright, uttering the exclamation--\n\n\"Wagh!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n        My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nThe trapper, who had meditated no violence, dropped his rifle again,\nand laughing at the success of his experiment, with great seeming\nself-complacency, he drew the astounded gaze of the naturalist from the\nperson of the savage to himself, by saying--\n\n\"The imps will lie for hours, like sleeping alligators, brooding their\ndeviltries in dreams and other craftiness, until such time as they see\nsome real danger is at hand, and then they look to themselves the same\nas other mortals. But this is a scouter in his war-paint! There should\nbe more of his tribe at no great distance. Let us draw the truth out\nof him; for an unlucky war-party may prove more dangerous to us than a\nvisit from the whole family of the squatter.\"\n\n\"It is truly a desperate and a dangerous species!\" said the Doctor,\nrelieving his amazement by a breath that seemed to exhaust his lungs of\nair; \"a violent race, and one that it is difficult to define or class,\nwithin the usual boundaries of definitions. Speak to him, therefore; but\nlet thy words be strong in amity.\"\n\nThe old man cast a keen eye on every side of him, to ascertain\nthe important particular whether the stranger was supported by any\nassociates, and then making the usual signs of peace, by exhibiting the\npalm of his naked hand, he boldly advanced. In the mean time, the Indian\nbetrayed no evidence of uneasiness. He suffered the trapper to draw\nnigh, maintaining by his own mien and attitude a striking air of dignity\nand fearlessness. Perhaps the wary warrior also knew that, owing to the\ndifference in their weapons, he should be placed more on an equality, by\nbeing brought nearer to the strangers.\n\nAs a description of this individual may furnish some idea of the\npersonal appearance of a whole race, it may be well to detain the\nnarrative, in order to present it to the reader, in our hasty and\nimperfect manner. Would the truant eyes of Alston or Greenough turn, but\nfor a time, from their gaze at the models of antiquity, to contemplate\nthis wronged and humbled people, little would be left for such inferior\nartists as ourselves to delineate.\n\nThe Indian in question was in every particular a warrior of fine stature\nand admirable proportions. As he cast aside his mask, composed of such\nparty-coloured leaves, as he had hurriedly collected, his countenance\nappeared in all the gravity, the dignity, and, it may be added, in the\nterror of his profession. The outlines of his lineaments were strikingly\nnoble, and nearly approaching to Roman, though the secondary features of\nhis face were slightly marked with the well-known traces of his Asiatic\norigin. The peculiar tint of the skin, which in itself is so well\ndesigned to aid the effect of a martial expression, had received an\nadditional aspect of wild ferocity from the colours of the war-paint.\nBut, as if he disdained the usual artifices of his people, he bore none\nof those strange and horrid devices, with which the children of the\nforest are accustomed, like the more civilised heroes of the moustache,\nto back their reputation for courage, contenting himself with a\nbroad and deep shadowing of black, that served as a sufficient and an\nadmirable foil to the brighter gleamings of his native swarthiness.\nHis head was as usual shaved to the crown, where a large and gallant\nscalp-lock seemed to challenge the grasp of his enemies. The ornaments\nthat were ordinarily pendant from the cartilages of his ears had been\nremoved, on account of his present pursuit. His body, notwithstanding\nthe lateness of the season, was nearly naked, and the portion which was\nclad bore a vestment no warmer than a light robe of the finest dressed\ndeer-skin, beautifully stained with the rude design of some daring\nexploit, and which was carelessly worn, as if more in pride than from\nany unmanly regard to comfort. His leggings were of bright scarlet\ncloth, the only evidence about his person that he had held communion\nwith the traders of the Pale-faces. But as if to furnish some offset\nto this solitary submission to a womanish vanity, they were fearfully\nfringed, from the gartered knee to the bottom of the moccasin, with the\nhair of human scalps. He leaned lightly with one hand on a short hickory\nbow, while the other rather touched than sought support, from the long,\ndelicate handle of an ashen lance. A quiver made of the cougar skin,\nfrom which the tail of the animal depended, as a characteristic\nornament, was slung at his back, and a shield of hides, quaintly\nemblazoned with another of his warlike deeds, was suspended from his\nneck by a thong of sinews.\n\nAs the trapper approached, this warrior maintained his calm upright\nattitude, discovering neither an eagerness to ascertain the character of\nthose who advanced upon him, nor the smallest wish to avoid a scrutiny\nin his own person. An eye, that was darker and more shining than that of\nthe stag, was incessantly glancing, however, from one to another of the\nstranger party, seemingly never knowing rest for an instant.\n\n\"Is my brother far from his village?\" demanded the old man, in the\nPawnee language, after examining the paint, and those other little signs\nby which a practised eye knows the tribe of the warrior he encounters in\nthe American deserts, with the same readiness, and by the same sort of\nmysterious observation, as that by which the seaman knows the distant\nsail.\n\n\"It is farther to the towns of the Big-knives,\" was the laconic reply.\n\n\"Why is a Pawnee-Loup so far from the fork of his own river, without a\nhorse to journey on, and in a spot empty as this?\"\n\n\"Can the women and children of a Pale-face live without the meat of the\nbison? There was hunger in my lodge.\"\n\n\"My brother is very young to be already the master of a lodge,\" returned\nthe trapper, looking steadily into the unmoved countenance of the\nyouthful warrior; \"but I dare say he is brave, and that many a chief has\noffered him his daughters for wives. But he has been mistaken,\" pointing\nto the arrow, which was dangling from the hand that held the bow, \"in\nbringing a loose and barbed arrow-head to kill the buffaloe. Do the\nPawnees wish the wounds they give their game to rankle?\"\n\n\"It is good to be ready for the Sioux. Though not in sight, a bush may\nhide him.\"\n\n\"The man is a living proof of the truth of his words,\" muttered the\ntrapper in English, \"and a close-jointed and gallant looking lad he is;\nbut far too young for a chief of any importance. It is wise, however, to\nspeak him fair, for a single arm thrown into either party, if we come\nto blows with the squatter and his brood, may turn the day. You see\nmy children are weary,\" he continued in the dialect of the prairies,\npointing, as he spoke, to the rest of the party, who, by this time, were\nalso approaching. \"We wish to camp and eat. Does my brother claim this\nspot?\"\n\n\"The runners from the people on the Big-river, tell us that your nation\nhave traded with the Tawney-faces who live beyond the salt-lake, and\nthat the prairies are now the hunting grounds of the Big-knives!\"\n\n\"It is true, as I hear, also, from the hunters and trappers on La\nPlatte. Though it is with the Frenchers, and not with the men who claim\nto own the Mexicos, that my people have bargained.\"\n\n\"And warriors are going up the Long-river, to see that they have not\nbeen cheated, in what they have bought?\"\n\n\"Ay, that is partly true, too, I fear; and it will not be long before an\naccursed band of choppers and loggers will be following on their heels,\nto humble the wilderness which lies so broad and rich on the western\nbanks of the Mississippi, and then the land will be a peopled desert,\nfrom the shores of the main sea to the foot of the Rocky Mountains;\nfill'd with all the abominations and craft of man, and stript of the\ncomforts and loveliness it received from the hands of the Lord!\"\n\n\"And where were the chiefs of the Pawnee-Loups, when this bargain was\nmade?\" suddenly demanded the youthful warrior, a look of startling\nfierceness gleaming, at the same instant, athwart his dark visage. \"Is a\nnation to be sold like the skin of a beaver?\"\n\n\"Right enough--right enough, and where were truth and honesty, also?\nBut might is right, according to the fashions of the 'arth; and what\nthe strong choose to do, the weak must call justice. If the law of\nthe Wahcondah was as much hearkened to, Pawnee, as the laws of the\nLong-knives, your right to the prairies would be as good as that of the\ngreatest chief in the settlements to the house which covers his head.\"\n\n\"The skin of the traveller is white,\" said the young native, laying a\nfinger impressively on the hard and wrinkled hand of the trapper. \"Does\nhis heart say one thing and his tongue another?\"\n\n\"The Wahcondah of a white man has ears, and he shuts them to a lie.\nLook at my head; it is like a frosted pine, and must soon be laid in the\nground. Why then should I wish to meet the Great Spirit, face to face,\nwhile his countenance is dark upon me.\"\n\nThe Pawnee gracefully threw his shield over one shoulder, and placing\na hand on his chest, he bent his head, in deference to the grey locks\nexhibited by the trapper; after which his eye became more steady, and\nhis countenance less fierce. Still he maintained every appearance of a\ndistrust and watchfulness that were rather tempered and subdued, than\nforgotten. When this equivocal species of amity was established between\nthe warrior of the prairies and the experienced old trapper, the latter\nproceeded to give his directions to Paul, concerning the arrangements\nof the contemplated halt. While Inez and Ellen were dismounting, and\nMiddleton and the bee-hunter were attending to their comforts, the\ndiscourse was continued, sometimes in the language of the natives,\nbut often, as Paul and the Doctor mingled their opinions with the two\nprincipal speakers, in the English tongue. There was a keen and subtle\ntrial of skill between the Pawnee and the trapper, in which each\nendeavoured to discover the objects of the other, without betraying\nhis own interest in the investigation. As might be expected, when the\nstruggle was between adversaries so equal, the result of the encounter\nanswered the expectations of neither. The latter had put all the\ninterrogatories his ingenuity and practice could suggest, concerning the\nstate of the tribe of the Loups, their crops, their store of provisions\nfor the ensuing winter, and their relations with their different warlike\nneighbours without extorting any answer, which, in the slightest degree,\nelucidated the cause of his finding a solitary warrior so far from his\npeople. On the other hand, while the questions of the Indian were far\nmore dignified and delicate, they were equally ingenious. He commented\non the state of the trade in peltries, spoke of the good or ill success\nof many white hunters, whom he had either encountered, or heard named,\nand even alluded to the steady march, which the nation of his great\nfather, as he cautiously termed the government of the States, was making\ntowards the hunting-grounds of his tribe. It was apparent, however, by\nthe singular mixture of interest, contempt, and indignation, that were\noccasionally gleaming through the reserved manner of this warrior, that\nhe knew the strange people, who were thus trespassing on his native\nrights, much more by report than by any actual intercourse. This\npersonal ignorance of the whites was as much betrayed by the manner\nin which he regarded the females, as by the brief, but energetic,\nexpressions which occasionally escaped him.\n\nWhile speaking to the trapper he suffered his wandering glances to stray\ntowards the intellectual and nearly infantile beauty of Inez, as one\nmight be supposed to gaze upon the loveliness of an ethereal being.\nIt was very evident that he now saw, for the first time, one of those\nfemales, of whom the fathers of his tribe so often spoke, and who were\nconsidered of such rare excellence as to equal all that savage ingenuity\ncould imagine in the way of loveliness. His observation of Ellen was\nless marked, but notwithstanding the warlike and chastened expression\nof his eye, there was much of the homage, which man is made to pay to\nwoman, even in the more cursory look he sometimes turned on her maturer\nand perhaps more animated beauty. This admiration, however, was so\ntempered by his habits, and so smothered in the pride of a warrior, as\ncompletely to elude every eye but that of the trapper, who was too well\nskilled in Indian customs, and was too well instructed in the importance\nof rightly conceiving, the character of the stranger, to let the\nsmallest trait, or the most trifling of his movements, escape him. In\nthe mean time, the unconscious Ellen herself moved about the feeble\nand less resolute Inez, with her accustomed assiduity and tenderness,\nexhibiting in her frank features those changing emotions of joy and\nregret which occasionally beset her, as her active mind dwelt on the\ndecided step she had just taken, with the contending doubts and hopes,\nand possibly with some of the mental vacillation, that was natural to\nher situation and sex.\n\nNot so Paul; conceiving himself to have obtained the two things dearest\nto his heart, the possession of Ellen and a triumph over the sons of\nIshmael, he now enacted his part, in the business of the moment, with as\nmuch coolness as though he was already leading his willing bride, from\nsolemnising their nuptials before a border magistrate, to the security\nof his own dwelling. He had hovered around the moving family, during\nthe tedious period of their weary march, concealing himself by day, and\nseeking interviews with his betrothed as opportunities offered, in the\nmanner already described, until fortune and his own intrepidity\nhad united to render him successful, at the very moment when he was\nbeginning to despair, and he now cared neither for distance, nor\nviolence, nor hardships. To his sanguine fancy and determined resolution\nall the rest was easily to be achieved. Such were his feelings, and such\nin truth they seemed to be. With his cap cast on one side, and whistling\na low air, he thrashed among the bushes, in order to make a place\nsuitable for the females to repose on, while, from time to time, he cast\nan approving glance at the agile form of Ellen, as she tripped past him,\nengaged in her own share of the duty.\n\n\"And so the Wolf-tribe of the Pawnees have buried the hatchet with their\nneighbours, the Konzas?\" said the trapper, pursuing a discourse which\nhe had scarcely permitted to flag, though it had been occasionally\ninterrupted by the different directions with which he occasionally saw\nfit to interrupt it. (The reader will remember that, while he spoke to\nthe native warrior in his own tongue, he necessarily addressed his white\ncompanions in English.) \"The Loups and the light-fac'd Red-skins are\nagain friends. Doctor, that is a tribe of which I'll engage you've often\nread, and of which many a round lie has been whispered in the ears of\nthe ignorant people, who live in the settlements. There was a story of\na nation of Welshers, that liv'd hereaway in the prairies, and how they\ncame into the land afore the uneasy minded man, who first let in the\nChristians to rob the heathens of their inheritance, had ever dreamt\nthat the sun set on a country as big as that it rose from. And how they\nknew the white ways, and spoke with white tongues, and a thousand other\nfollies and idle conceits.\"\n\n\"Have I not heard of them?\" exclaimed the naturalist, dropping a piece\nof jerked bison's meat, which he was rather roughly discussing, at\nthe moment. \"I should be greatly ignorant not to have often dwelt\nwith delight on so beautiful a theory, and one which so triumphantly\nestablishes two positions, which I have often maintained are\nunanswerable, even without such living testimony in their favour--viz.\nthat this continent can claim a more remote affinity with civilisation\nthan the time of Columbus, and that colour is the fruit of climate and\ncondition, and not a regulation of nature. Propound the latter question\nto this Indian gentleman, venerable hunter; he is of a reddish tint\nhimself, and his opinion may be said to make us masters of the two sides\nof the disputed point.\"\n\n\"Do you think a Pawnee is a reader of books, and a believer of printed\nlies, like the idlers in the towns?\" retorted the old man, laughing.\n\"But it may be as well to humour the likings of the man, which, after\nall, it is quite possible are neither more nor less than his natural\ngift, and therefore to be followed, although they may be pitied. What\ndoes my brother think? all whom he sees here have pale skins, but the\nPawnee warriors are red; does he believe that man changes with the\nseason, and that the son is not like his father?\"\n\nThe young warrior regarded his interrogator for a moment with a steady\nand deliberating eye; then raising his finger upward, he answered with\ndignity--\n\n\"The Wahcondah pours the rain from his clouds; when he speaks, he shakes\nthe lulls; and the fire, which scorches the trees, is the anger of his\neye; but he fashioned his children with care and thought. What he has\nthus made, never alters!\"\n\n\"Ay, 'tis in the reason of natur' that it should be so, Doctor,\"\ncontinued the trapper, when he had interpreted this answer to the\ndisappointed naturalist. \"The Pawnees are a wise and a great people, and\nI'll engage they abound in many a wholesome and honest tradition. The\nhunters and trappers, that I sometimes see, speak of a great warrior of\nyour race.\"\n\n\"My tribe are not women. A brave is no stranger in my village.\"\n\n\"Ay; but he, they speak of most, is a chief far beyond the renown of\ncommon warriors, and one that might have done credit to that once mighty\nbut now fallen people, the Delawares of the hills.\"\n\n\"Such a warrior should have a name?\"\n\n\"They call him Hard-Heart, from the stoutness of his resolution; and\nwell is he named, if all I have heard of his deeds be true.\"\n\nThe stranger cast a glance, which seemed to read the guileless soul of\nthe old man, as he demanded--\n\n\"Has the Pale-face seen the partisan of my people?\"\n\n\"Never. It is not with me now, as it used to be some forty years ago,\nwhen warfare and bloodshed were my calling and my gifts!\"\n\nA loud shout from the reckless Paul interrupted his speech, and at the\nnext moment the bee-hunter appeared, leading an Indian war-horse from\nthe side of the thicket opposite to the one occupied by the party.\n\n\"Here is a beast for a Red-skin to straddle!\" he cried, as he made the\nanimal go through some of its wild paces. \"There's not a brigadier in\nall Kentucky that can call himself master of so sleek and well-jointed\na nag! A Spanish saddle too, like a grandee of the Mexicos! and look at\nthe mane and tail, braided and platted down with little silver balls, as\nif it were Ellen herself getting her shining hair ready for a dance, or\na husking frolic! Isn't this a real trotter, old trapper, to eat out of\nthe manger of a savage?\"\n\n\"Softly, lad, softly. The Loups are famous for their horses, and it is\noften that you see a warrior on the prairies far better mounted, than a\ncongress-man in the settlements. But this, indeed, is a beast that none\nbut a powerful chief should ride! The saddle, as you rightly think, has\nbeen sit upon in its day by a great Spanish captain, who has lost it and\nhis life together, in some of the battles which this people often\nfight against the southern provinces. I warrant me, I warrant me, the\nyoungster is the son of a great chief; may be of the mighty Hard-Heart\nhimself!\"\n\nDuring this rude interruption to the discourse, the young Pawnee\nmanifested neither impatience nor displeasure; but when he thought his\nbeast had been the subject of sufficient comment, he very coolly, and\nwith the air of one accustomed to have his will respected, relieved\nPaul of the bridle, and throwing the reins on the neck of the animal, he\nsprang upon his back, with the activity of a professor of the equestrian\nart. Nothing could be finer or firmer than the seat of the savage. The\nhighly wrought and cumbrous saddle was evidently more for show than use.\nIndeed it impeded rather than aided the action of limbs, which disdained\nto seek assistance, or admit of restraint from so womanish inventions\nas stirrups. The horse, which immediately began to prance, was, like\nits rider, wild and untutored in all his motions, but while there was\nso little of art, there was all the freedom and grace of nature in the\nmovements of both. The animal was probably indebted to the blood of\nAraby for its excellence, through a long pedigree, that embraced the\nsteed of Mexico, the Spanish barb, and the Moorish charger. The rider,\nin obtaining his steed from the provinces of Central-America, had also\nobtained that spirit and grace in controlling him, which unite to form\nthe most intrepid and perhaps the most skilful horseman in the world.\n\nNotwithstanding this sudden occupation of his animal, the Pawnee\ndiscovered no hasty wish to depart. More at his ease, and possibly more\nindependent, now he found himself secure of the means of retreat, he\nrode back and forth, eyeing the different individuals of the party with\nfar greater freedom than before. But, at each extremity of his ride,\njust as the sagacious trapper expected to see him profit by his\nadvantage and fly, he would turn his horse, and pass over the same\nground, sometimes with the rapidity of the flying deer, and at others\nmore slowly, and with greater dignity of mien and attitude. Anxious to\nascertain such facts as might have an influence on his future movements,\nthe old man determined to invite him to a renewal of their conference.\nHe therefore made a gesture expressive at the same time of his wish to\nresume the interrupted discourse, and of his own pacific intentions. The\nquick eye of the stranger was not slow to note the action, but it\nwas not until a sufficient time had passed to allow him to debate the\nprudence of the measure in his own mind, that he seemed willing to trust\nhimself again, so near a party that was so much superior to himself in\nphysical power, and consequently one that was able, at any instant, to\ncommand his life, or control his personal liberty. When he did approach\nnigh enough to converse with facility, it was with a singular mixture of\nhaughtiness and of distrust.\n\n\"It is far to the village of the Loups,\" he said, stretching his arm in\na direction contrary to that in which, the trapper well knew, the tribe\ndwelt, \"and the road is crooked. What has the Big-knife to say?\"\n\n\"Ay, crooked enough!\" muttered the old man in English, \"if you are to\nset out on your journey by that path, but not half so winding as the\ncunning of an Indian's mind. Say, my brother; do the chiefs of the\nPawnees love to see strange faces in their lodges?\"\n\nThe young warrior bent his body gracefully, though but slightly, over\nthe saddle-bow, as he replied--\n\n\"When have my people forgotten to give food to the stranger?\"\n\n\"If I lead my daughters to the doors of the Loups, will the women take\nthem by the hand; and will the warriors smoke with my young men?\"\n\n\"The country of the Pale-faces is behind them. Why do they journey so\nfar towards the setting sun? Have they lost the path, or are these the\nwomen of the white warriors, that I hear are wading up the river of 'the\ntroubled waters?'\"\n\n\"Neither. They, who wade the Missouri, are the warriors of my great\nfather, who has sent them on his message; but we are peace-runners. The\nwhite men and the red are neighbours, and they wish to be friends.--Do\nnot the Omahaws visit the Loups, when the tomahawk is buried in the path\nbetween the two nations?\"\n\n\"The Omahaws are welcome.\"\n\n\"And the Yanktons, and the burnt-wood Tetons, who live in the elbow of\nthe river, 'with muddy water,' do they not come into the lodges of the\nLoups and smoke?\"\n\n\"The Tetons are liars!\" exclaimed the other. \"They dare not shut their\neyes in the night. No; they sleep in the sun. See,\" he added, pointing\nwith fierce triumph to the frightful ornaments of his leggings, \"their\nscalps are so plenty, that the Pawnees tread on them! Go; let a Sioux\nlive in banks of snow; the plains and buffaloes are for men!\"\n\n\"Ah! the secret is out,\" said the trapper to Middleton, who was an\nattentive, because a deeply interested, observer of what was passing.\n\"This good-looking young Indian is scouting on the track of the\nSiouxes--you may see it by his arrow-heads, and his paint; ay, and by\nhis eye, too; for a Red-skin lets his natur' follow the business he is\non, be it for peace, or be it for war,--quiet, Hector, quiet. Have\nyou never scented a Pawnee afore, pup?--keep down, dog--keep down--my\nbrother is right. The Siouxes are thieves. Men of all colours and\nnations say it of them, and say it truly. But the people from the rising\nsun are not Siouxes, and they wish to visit the lodges of the Loups.\"\n\n\"The head of my brother is white,\" returned the Pawnee, throwing one\nof those glances at the trapper, which were so remarkably expressive of\ndistrust, intelligence, and pride, and then pointing, as he continued,\ntowards the eastern horizon, \"and his eyes have looked on many\nthings--can he tell me the name of what he sees yonder--is it a\nbuffaloe?\"\n\n\"It looks more like a cloud, peeping above the skirt of the plain with\nthe sunshine lighting its edges. It is the smoke of the heavens.\"\n\n\"It is a hill of the earth, and on its top are the lodges of Pale-faces!\nLet the women of my brother wash their feet among the people of their\nown colour.\"\n\n\"The eyes of a Pawnee are good, if he can see a white-skin so far.\"\n\nThe Indian turned slowly towards the speaker, and after a pause of a\nmoment he sternly demanded--\n\n\"Can my brother hunt?\"\n\n\"Alas! I claim to be no better than a miserable trapper!\"\n\n\"When the plain is covered with the buffaloes, can he see them?\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt--it is far easier to see than to take a scampering\nbull.\"\n\n\"And when the birds are flying from the cold, and the clouds are black\nwith their feathers, can he see them too?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, it is not hard to find a duck, or a goose, when millions are\ndarkening the heavens.\"\n\n\"When the snow falls, and covers the lodges of the Long-knives, can the\nstranger see flakes in the air?\"\n\n\"My eyes are none of the best now,\" returned the old man a little\nresentfully, \"but the time has been when I had a name for my sight!\"\n\n\"The Red-skins find the Big-knives as easily as the strangers see the\nbuffaloe, or the travelling birds, or the falling snow. Your warriors\nthink the Master of Life has made the whole earth white. They are\nmistaken. They are pale, and it is their own faces that they see. Go! a\nPawnee is not blind, that he need look long for your people!\"\n\nThe warrior suddenly paused, and bent his face aside, like one who\nlistened with all his faculties absorbed in the act. Then turning the\nhead of his horse, he rode to the nearest angle of the thicket, and\nlooked intently across the bleak prairie, in a direction opposite to the\nside on which the party stood. Returning slowly from this unaccountable,\nand to his observers, startling procedure, he riveted his eyes on\nInez, and paced back and forth several times, with the air of one who\nmaintained a warm struggle on some difficult point, in the recesses of\nhis own thoughts. He had drawn the reins of his impatient steed, and was\nseemingly about to speak, when his head again sunk on his chest, and he\nresumed his former attitude of attention. Galloping like a deer, to the\nplace of his former observations, he rode for a moment swiftly, in short\nand rapid circles, as if still uncertain of his course, and then darted\naway, like a bird that had been fluttering around its nest before it\ntakes a distant flight. After scouring the plain for a minute, he was\nlost to the eye behind a swell of the land.\n\nThe hounds, who had also manifested great uneasiness for some time,\nfollowed him for a little distance, and then terminated their chase by\nseating themselves on the ground, and raising their usual low, whining,\nand warning howls.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n                      How if he will not stand?\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nThe several movements, related in the close of the preceding chapter,\nhad passed in so short a space of time, that the old man, while he\nneglected not to note the smallest incident, had no opportunity of\nexpressing his opinion concerning the stranger's motives. After the\nPawnee had disappeared, however, he shook his head and muttered, while\nhe walked slowly to the angle of the thicket that the Indian had just\nquitted--\n\n\"There are both scents and sounds in the air, though my miserable\nsenses are not good enough to hear the one, or to catch the taint of the\nother.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to be seen,\" cried Middleton, who kept close at his\nside. \"My eyes and my ears are good, and yet I can assure you that I\nneither hear nor see any thing.\"\n\n\"Your eyes are good! and you are not deaf!\" returned the other with a\nslight air of contempt; \"no, lad, no; they may be good to see across a\nchurch, or to hear a town-bell, but afore you had passed a year in these\nprairies you would find yourself taking a turkey for a buffaloe, or\nconceiting, fifty times, that the roar of a buffaloe bull was the\nthunder of the Lord! There is a deception of natur' in these naked\nplains, in which the air throws up the images like water, and then it is\nhard to tell the prairies from a sea. But yonder is a sign that a hunter\nnever fails to know!\"\n\nThe trapper pointed to a flight of vultures, that were sailing over the\nplain at no great distance, and apparently in the direction in which the\nPawnee had riveted his eye. At first Middleton could not distinguish the\nsmall dark objects, that were dotting the dusky clouds, but as they came\nswiftly onward, first their forms, and then their heavy waving wings,\nbecame distinctly visible.\n\n\"Listen,\" said the trapper, when he had succeeded in making Middleton\nsee the moving column of birds. \"Now you hear the buffaloes, or bisons,\nas your knowing Doctor sees fit to call them, though buffaloes is their\nname among all the hunters of these regions. And, I conclude, that a\nhunter is a better judge of a beast and of its name,\" he added, winking\nto the young soldier, \"than any man who has turned over the leaves of a\nbook, instead of travelling over the face of the 'arth, in order to find\nout the natur's of its inhabitants.\"\n\n\"Of their habits, I will grant you,\" cried the naturalist, who rarely\nmissed an opportunity to agitate any disputed point in his favourite\nstudies. \"That is, provided always, deference is had to the proper use\nof definitions, and that they are contemplated with scientific eyes.\"\n\n\"Eyes of a mole! as if man's eyes were not as good for names as the eyes\nof any other creatur'! Who named the works of His hand? can you tell me\nthat, with your books and college wisdom? Was it not the first man in\nthe Garden, and is it not a plain consequence that his children inherit\nhis gifts?\"\n\n\"That is certainly the Mosaic account of the event,\" said the Doctor;\n\"though your reading is by far too literal!\"\n\n\"My reading! nay, if you suppose, that I have wasted my time in schools,\nyou do such a wrong to my knowledge, as one mortal should never lay to\nthe door of another without sufficient reason. If I have ever craved the\nart of reading, it has been that I might better know the sayings of the\nbook you name, for it is a book which speaks, in every line, according\nto human feelings, and therein according to reason.\"\n\n\"And do you then believe,\" said the Doctor a little provoked by\nthe dogmatism of his stubborn adversary, and perhaps, secretly, too\nconfident in his own more liberal, though scarcely as profitable,\nattainments,--\"do you then believe that all these beasts were literally\ncollected in a garden, to be enrolled in the nomenclature of the first\nman?\"\n\n\"Why not? I understand your meaning; for it is not needful to live in\ntowns to hear all the devilish devices, that the conceit of man can\ninvent to upset his own happiness. What does it prove, except indeed it\nmay be said to prove that the garden He made was not after the miserable\nfashions of our times, thereby directly giving the lie to what the world\ncalls its civilising? No, no, the garden of the Lord was the forest\nthen, and is the forest now, where the fruits do grow, and the birds\ndo sing, according to his own wise ordering. Now, lady, you may see\nthe mystery of the vultures! There come the buffaloes themselves, and a\nnoble herd it is! I warrant me, that Pawnee has a troop of his people in\nsome of the hollows, nigh by; and as he has gone scampering after\nthem, you are about to see a glorious chase. It will serve to keep the\nsquatter and his brood under cover, and for ourselves there is little\nreason to fear. A Pawnee is not apt to be a malicious savage.\"\n\nEvery eye was now drawn to the striking spectacle that succeeded. Even\nthe timid Inez hastened to the side of Middleton to gaze at the sight,\nand Paul summoned Ellen from her culinary labours, to become a witness\nof the lively scene.\n\nThroughout the whole of those moving events, which it has been our duty\nto record, the prairies had lain in the majesty of perfect solitude. The\nheavens had been blackened with the passage of the migratory birds, it\nis true, but the dogs of the party, and the ass of the doctor, were\nthe only quadrupeds that had enlivened the broad surface of the waste\nbeneath. There was now a sudden exhibition of animal life, which changed\nthe scene, as it were, by magic, to the very opposite extreme.\n\nA few enormous bison bulls were first observed, scouring along the most\ndistant roll of the prairie, and then succeeded long files of single\nbeasts, which, in their turns, were followed by a dark mass of bodies,\nuntil the dun-coloured herbage of the plain was entirely lost, in the\ndeeper hue of their shaggy coats. The herd, as the column spread and\nthickened, was like the endless flocks of the smaller birds, whose\nextended flanks are so often seen to heave up out of the abyss of the\nheavens, until they appear as countless as the leaves in those forests,\nover which they wing their endless flight. Clouds of dust shot up in\nlittle columns from the centre of the mass, as some animal, more furious\nthan the rest, ploughed the plain with his horns, and, from time to\ntime, a deep hollow bellowing was borne along on the wind, as if a\nthousand throats vented their plaints in a discordant murmuring.\n\nA long and musing silence reigned in the party, as they gazed on this\nspectacle of wild and peculiar grandeur. It was at length broken by the\ntrapper, who, having been long accustomed to similar sights, felt less\nof its influence, or, rather, felt it in a less thrilling and absorbing\nmanner, than those to whom the scene was more novel.\n\n\"There go ten thousand oxen in one drove, without keeper or master,\nexcept Him who made them, and gave them these open plains for their\npasture! Ay, it is here that man may see the proofs of his wantonness\nand folly! Can the proudest governor in all the States go into his\nfields, and slaughter a nobler bullock than is here offered to the\nmeanest hand; and when he has gotten his sirloin, or his steak, can\nhe eat it with as good a relish as he who has sweetened his food\nwith wholesome toil, and earned it according to the law of natur', by\nhonestly mastering that which the Lord hath put before him?\"\n\n\"If the prairie platter is smoking with a buffaloe's hump, I answer,\nNo,\" interrupted the luxurious bee-hunter.\n\n\"Ay, boy, you have tasted, and you feel the genuine reasoning of the\nthing! But the herd is heading a little this-a-way, and it behoves us to\nmake ready for their visit. If we hide ourselves, altogether, the horned\nbrutes will break through the place and trample us beneath their feet,\nlike so many creeping worms; so we will just put the weak ones apart,\nand take post, as becomes men and hunters, in the van.\"\n\nAs there was but little time to make the necessary arrangements, the\nwhole party set about them in good earnest. Inez and Ellen were placed\nin the edge of the thicket on the side farthest from the approaching\nherd. Asinus was posted in the centre, in consideration of his nerves,\nand then the old man, with his three male companions, divided themselves\nin such a manner as they thought would enable them to turn the head\nof the rushing column, should it chance to approach too nigh their\nposition. By the vacillating movements of some fifty or a hundred bulls,\nthat led the advance, it remained questionable, for many moments, what\ncourse they intended to pursue. But a tremendous and painful roar, which\ncame from behind the cloud of dust that rose in the centre of the herd,\nand which was horridly answered by the screams of the carrion birds,\nthat were greedily sailing directly above the flying drove, appeared to\ngive a new impulse to their flight, and at once to remove every symptom\nof indecision. As if glad to seek the smallest signs of the forest, the\nwhole of the affrighted herd became steady in its direction, rushing\nin a straight line toward the little cover of bushes, which has already\nbeen so often named.\n\nThe appearance of danger was now, in reality, of a character to try the\nstoutest nerves. The flanks of the dark, moving mass, were advanced in\nsuch a manner as to make a concave line of the front, and every fierce\neye, that was glaring from the shaggy wilderness of hair in which the\nentire heads of the males were enveloped, was riveted with mad anxiety\non the thicket. It seemed as if each beast strove to outstrip his\nneighbour, in gaining this desired cover; and as thousands in the\nrear pressed blindly on those in front, there was the appearance of an\nimminent risk that the leaders of the herd would be precipitated on the\nconcealed party, in which case the destruction of every one of them was\ncertain. Each of our adventurers felt the danger of his situation in a\nmanner peculiar to his individual character and circumstances.\n\nMiddleton wavered. At times he felt inclined to rush through the bushes,\nand, seizing Inez, attempt to fly. Then recollecting the impossibility\nof outstripping the furious speed of an alarmed bison, he felt for his\narms, determined to make head against the countless drove. The faculties\nof Dr. Battius were quickly wrought up to the very summit of mental\ndelusion. The dark forms of the herd lost their distinctness, and then\nthe naturalist began to fancy he beheld a wild collection of all the\ncreatures of the world, rushing upon him in a body, as if to revenge the\nvarious injuries, which in the course of a life of indefatigable labour\nin behalf of the natural sciences, he had inflicted on their several\ngenera. The paralysis it occasioned in his system, was like the effect\nof the incubus. Equally unable to fly or to advance, he stood riveted\nto the spot, until the infatuation became so complete, that the\nworthy naturalist was beginning, by a desperate effort of scientific\nresolution, even to class the different specimens. On the other hand,\nPaul shouted, and called on Ellen to come and assist him in shouting,\nbut his voice was lost in the bellowings and trampling of the herd.\nFurious, and yet strangely excited by the obstinacy of the brutes and\nthe wildness of the sight, and nearly maddened by sympathy and a\nspecies of unconscious apprehension, in which the claims of nature were\nsingularly mingled with concern for his mistress, he nearly split his\nthroat in exhorting his aged friend to interfere.\n\n\"Come forth, old trapper,\" he shouted, \"with your prairie inventions! or\nwe shall be all smothered under a mountain of buffaloe humps!\"\n\nThe old man, who had stood all this while leaning on his rifle, and\nregarding the movements of the herd with a steady eye, now deemed it\ntime to strike his blow. Levelling his piece at the foremost bull,\nwith an agility that would have done credit to his youth, he fired. The\nanimal received the bullet on the matted hair between his horns, and\nfell to his knees: but shaking his head he instantly arose, the very\nshock seeming to increase his exertions. There was now no longer time to\nhesitate. Throwing down his rifle, the trapper stretched forth his\narms, and advanced from the cover with naked hands, directly towards the\nrushing column of the beasts.\n\nThe figure of a man, when sustained by the firmness and steadiness that\nintellect can only impart, rarely fails of commanding respect from all\nthe inferior animals of the creation. The leading bulls recoiled, and\nfor a single instant there was a sudden stop to their speed, a dense\nmass of bodies rolling up in front, until hundreds were seen floundering\nand tumbling on the plain. Then came another of those hollow bellowings\nfrom the rear, and set the herd again in motion. The head of the column,\nhowever, divided. The immovable form of the trapper, cutting it, as it\nwere, into two gliding streams of life. Middleton and Paul instantly\nprofited by his example, and extended the feeble barrier by a similar\nexhibition of their own persons.\n\nFor a few moments, the new impulse given to the animals in front, served\nto protect the thicket. But, as the body of the herd pressed more and\nmore upon the open line of its defenders, and the dust thickened, so as\nto obscure their persons, there was, at each instant, a renewed danger\nof the beasts breaking through. It became necessary for the trapper\nand his companions to become still more and more alert; and they were\ngradually yielding before the headlong multitude, when a furious bull\ndarted by Middleton, so near as to brush his person, and, at the next\ninstant, swept through the thicket with the velocity of the wind.\n\n\"Close, and die for the ground,\" shouted the old man, \"or a thousand of\nthe devils will be at his heels!\"\n\nAll their efforts would have proved fruitless, however, against the\nliving torrent, had not Asinus, whose domains had just been so rudely\nentered, lifted his voice, in the midst of the uproar. The most sturdy\nand furious of the bulls trembled at the alarming and unknown cry,\nand then each individual brute was seen madly pressing from that very\nthicket, which, the moment before, he had endeavoured to reach, with the\neagerness with which the murderer seeks the sanctuary.\n\nAs the stream divided, the place became clear; the two dark columns\nmoving obliquely from the copse, to unite again at the distance of\na mile, on its opposite side. The instant the old man saw the sudden\neffect which the voice of Asinus had produced, he coolly commenced\nreloading his rifle, indulging at the same time in a heartfelt fit of\nhis silent and peculiar merriment.\n\n\"There they go, like dogs with so many half-filled shot-pouches dangling\nat their tails, and no fear of their breaking their order; for what the\nbrutes in the rear didn't hear with their own ears, they'll conceit they\ndid: besides, if they change their minds, it may be no hard matter to\nget the Jack to sing the rest of his tune!\"\n\n\"The ass has spoken, but Balaam is silent!\" cried the bee-hunter,\ncatching his breath after a repeated burst of noisy mirth, that might\npossibly have added to the panic of the buffaloes by its vociferation.\n\"The man is as completely dumb-founded, as if a swarm of young bees had\nsettled on the end of his tongue, and he not willing to speak, for fear\nof their answer.\"\n\n\"How now, friend,\" continued the trapper, addressing the still\nmotionless and entranced naturalist; \"how now, friend; are you, who make\nyour livelihood by booking the names and natur's of the beasts of the\nfields and the fowls of the air, frightened at a herd of scampering\nbuffaloes? Though, perhaps, you are ready to dispute my right to call\nthem by a word, that is in the mouth of every hunter and trader on the\nfrontier!\"\n\nThe old man was however mistaken, in supposing he could excite the\nbenumbed faculties of the Doctor, by provoking a discussion. From that\ntime, henceforth, he was never known, except on one occasion, to utter a\nword that indicated either the species, or the genus, of the animal. He\nobstinately refused the nutritious food of the whole ox family, and even\nto the present hour, now that he is established in all the scientific\ndignity and security of a savant in one of the maritime towns, he turns\nhis back with a shudder on those delicious and unrivalled viands, that\nare so often seen at the suppers of the craft, and which are unequalled\nby any thing, that is served under the same name, at the boasted\nchop-houses of London, or at the most renowned of the Parisian\nrestaurants. In short, the distaste of the worthy naturalist for beef\nwas not unlike that which the shepherd sometimes produces, by first\nmuzzling and fettering his delinquent dog, and then leaving him as a\nstepping stone for the whole flock to use in its transit over a wall, or\nthrough the opening of a sheep-fold; a process which is said to produce\nin the culprit a species of surfeit, on the subject of mutton, for ever\nafter. By the time Paul and the trapper saw fit to terminate the fresh\nbursts of merriment, which the continued abstraction of their learned\ncompanion did not fail to excite, he commenced breathing again, as if\nthe suspended action of his lungs had been renewed by the application\nof a pair of artificial bellows, and was heard to make use of the ever\nafterwards proscribed term, on that solitary occasion, to which we have\njust alluded.\n\n\"Boves Americani horridi!\" exclaimed the Doctor, laying great stress on\nthe latter word; after which he continued mute, like one who pondered on\nstrange and unaccountable events.\n\n\"Ay, horrid eyes enough, I will willingly allow,\" returned the trapper;\n\"and altogether the creatur' has a frightful look, to one unused to the\nsights and bustle of a natural life; but then the courage of the beast\nis in no way equal to its countenance. Lord, man, if you should once get\nfairly beset by a brood of grizzly bears, as happened to Hector and I,\nat the great falls of the Miss--Ah, here comes the tail of the herd, and\nyonder goes a pack of hungry wolves, ready to pick up the sick, or such\nas get a disjointed neck by a tumble. Ha! there are mounted men on their\ntrail, or I'm no sinner! here, lad; you may see them here-away, just\nwhere the dust is scattering afore the wind. They are hovering around a\nwounded buffaloe, making an end of the surly devil with their arrows!\"\n\nMiddleton and Paul soon caught a glimpse of the dark group, that the\nquick eye of the old man had so readily detected. Some fifteen or twenty\nhorsemen were, in truth, to be seen riding, in quick circuits, about\na noble bull, which stood at bay, too grievously hurt to fly, and yet\nseeming to disdain to fall, notwithstanding his hardy body had already\nbeen the target for a hundred arrows. A thrust from the lance of a\npowerful Indian, however, completed his conquest, and the brute gave up\nhis obstinate hold of life with a roar, that passed bellowing over\nthe place where our adventurers stood, and, reaching the ears of the\naffrighted herd, added a new impulse to their flight.\n\n\"How well the Pawnee knew the philosophy of a buffaloe hunt!\" said\nthe old man, after he had stood regarding the animated scene for a few\nmoments, with evident satisfaction. \"You saw how he went off like the\nwind before the drove. It was in order that he might not taint the air,\nand that he might turn the flank, and join--Ha! how is this! yonder\nRed-skins are no Pawnees! The feathers in their heads are from the wings\nand tails of owls.--Ah! as I am but a miserable, half-sighted, trapper,\nit is a band of the accursed Siouxes! To cover, lads, to cover. A single\ncast of an eye this-a-way, would strip us of every rag of clothes, as\nsurely as the lightning scorches the bush, and it might be that our very\nlives would be far from safe.\"\n\nMiddleton had already turned from the spectacle, to seek that which\npleased him better; the sight of his young and beautiful bride. Paul\nseized the Doctor by the arm; and, as the trapper followed with the\nsmallest possible delay, the whole party was quickly collected within\nthe cover of the thicket. After a few short explanations concerning the\ncharacter of this new danger, the old man, on whom the whole duty\nof directing their movements was devolved, in deference to his great\nexperience, continued his discourse as follows--\n\n\"This is a region, as you must all know, where a strong arm is far\nbetter than the right, and where the white law is as little known as\nneeded. Therefore does every thing, now, depend on judgment and\npower. If,\" he continued, laying his finger on his cheek, like one who\nconsidered deeply all sides of the embarrassing situation in which he\nfound himself,--\"if an invention could be framed, which would set these\nSiouxes and the brood of the squatter by the ears, then might we come\nin, like the buzzards after a fight atween the beasts, and pick up the\ngleanings of the ground--there are Pawnees nigh us, too! It is a certain\nmatter, for yonder lad is not so far from his village without an errand.\nHere are therefore four parties within sound of a cannon, not one of\nwhom can trust the other. All which makes movement a little difficult,\nin a district where covers are far from plenty. But we are three\nwell-armed, and I think I may see three stout-hearted men--\"\n\n\"Four,\" interrupted Paul.\n\n\"Anan,\" said the old man, looking up simply at his companion.\n\n\"Four,\" repeated the bee-hunter, pointing to the naturalist.\n\n\"Every army has its hangers-on and idlers,\" rejoined the blunt\nborder-man. \"Friend, it will be necessary to slaughter this ass.\"\n\n\"To slay Asinus! such a deed would be an act of supererogatory cruelty.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of your words, which hide their meaning in sound; but\nthat is cruel which sacrifices a Christian to a brute. This is what I\ncall the reason of mercy. It would be just as safe to blow a trumpet,\nas to let the animal raise his voice again, inasmuch as it would prove a\nmanifest challenge to the Siouxes.\"\n\n\"I will answer for the discretion of Asinus, who seldom speaks without a\nreason.\"\n\n\"They say a man can be known by the company he keeps,\" retorted the old\nman, \"and why not a brute? I once made a forced march, and went through\na great deal of jeopardy, with a companion who never opened his mouth\nbut to sing; and trouble enough and great concern of mind did the fellow\ngive me. It was in that very business with your grand'ther, captain.\nBut then he had a human throat, and well did he know how to use it, on\noccasion, though he didn't always stop to regard the time and seasons\nfit for such outcries. Ah's me! if I was now, as I was then, it wouldn't\nbe a band of thieving Siouxes that should easily drive me from such a\nlodgment as this! But what signifies boasting, when sight and strength\nare both failing. The warrior, that the Delawares once saw fit to call\nafter the Hawk, for the goodness of his eyes, would now be better termed\nthe Mole! In my judgment, therefore, it will be well to slay the brute.\"\n\n\"There's argument and good logic in it,\" said Paul; \"music is music,\nand it's always noisy, whether it comes from a fiddle or a jackass.\nTherefore I agree with the old man, and say, Kill the beast.\"\n\n\"Friends,\" said the naturalist, looking with a sorrowful eye from one to\nanother of his bloodily disposed companions, \"slay not Asinus; he is\na specimen of his kind, of whom much good and little evil can be said.\nHardy and docile for his genus; abstemious and patient, even for his\nhumble species. We have journeyed much together, and his death would\ngrieve me. How would it trouble thy spirit, venerable venator, to\nseparate, in such an untimely manner, from your faithful hound?\"\n\n\"The animal shall not die,\" said the old man, suddenly clearing his\nthroat, in a manner that proved he felt the force of the appeal; \"but\nhis voice must be smothered. Bind his jaws with the halter, and then I\nthink we may trust the rest to Providence.\"\n\nWith this double security for the discretion of Asinus, for Paul\ninstantly bound the muzzle of the ass in the manner required, the\ntrapper seemed content. After which he proceeded to the margin of the\nthicket to reconnoitre.\n\nThe uproar, which attended the passage of the herd, was now gone, or\nrather it was heard rolling along the prairie, at the distance of a\nmile. The clouds of dust were already blown away by the wind, and a\nclear range was left to the eye, in that place where ten minutes before\nthere existed a scene of so much wildness and confusion.\n\nThe Siouxes had completed their conquest, and, apparently satisfied with\nthis addition to the numerous previous captures they had made, they now\nseemed content to let the remainder of the herd escape. A dozen remained\naround the carcass, over which a few buzzards were balancing themselves\nwith steady wings and greedy eyes, while the rest were riding about, in\nquest of such further booty as might come in their way, on the trail of\nso vast a drove. The trapper measured the proportions, and scanned\nthe equipments of such individuals as drew nearer to the side of the\nthicket, with careful eyes. At length he pointed out one among them, to\nMiddleton, as Weucha.\n\n\"Now, know we not only who they are, but their errand,\" the old man\ncontinued, deliberately shaking his head. \"They have lost the trail of\nthe squatter, and are on its hunt. These buffaloes have crossed their\npath, and in chasing the animals, bad luck has led them in open sight\nof the hill on which the brood of Ishmael have harboured. Do you see yon\nbirds watching for the offals of the beast they have killed? Therein is\na moral, which teaches the manner of a prairie life. A band of Pawnees\nare outlying for these very Siouxes, as you see the buzzards looking\ndown for their food, and it behoves us, as Christian men who have so\nmuch at stake, to look down upon them both. Ha! what brings yonder two\nskirting reptiles to a stand? As you live, they have found the place\nwhere the miserable son of the squatter met his death!\"\n\nThe old man was not mistaken. Weucha, and a savage who accompanied him,\nhad reached that spot, which has already been mentioned as furnishing\nthe frightful evidences of violence and bloodshed. There they sat on\ntheir horses, examining the well-known signs, with the intelligence\nthat distinguishes the habits of Indians. Their scrutiny was long, and\napparently not without distrust. At length they raised a cry, that\nwas scarcely less piteous and startling than that which the hounds had\nbefore made over the same fatal signs, and which did not fail to draw\nthe whole band immediately around them, as the fell bark of the jackal\nis said to gather his comrades to the chase.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n                       Welcome, ancient Pistol.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nIt was not long before the trapper pointed out the commanding person of\nMahtoree, as the leader of the Siouxes. This chief, who had been among\nthe last to obey the vociferous summons of Weucha, no sooner reached the\nspot where his whole party was now gathered, than he threw himself\nfrom his horse, and proceeded to examine the marks of the extraordinary\ntrail, with that degree of dignity and attention which became his high\nand responsible station. The warriors, for it was but too evident that\nthey were to a man of that fearless and ruthless class, awaited the\nresult of his investigation with patient reserve; none but a few of the\nprincipal braves, presuming even to speak, while their leader was\nthus gravely occupied. It was several minutes before Mahtoree seemed\nsatisfied. He then directed his eyes along the ground to those several\nplaces where Ishmael had found the same revolting evidences of the\npassage of some bloody struggle, and motioned to his people to follow.\n\nThe whole band advanced in a body towards the thicket, until they came\nto a halt, within a few yards of the precise spot, where Esther had\nstimulated her sluggish sons to break into the cover. The reader will\nreadily imagine that the trapper and his companions were not indifferent\nobservers of so threatening a movement. The old man summoned all\nwho were capable of bearing arms to his side, and demanded, in very\nunequivocal terms, though in a voice that was suitably lowered, in order\nto escape the ears of their dangerous neighbours, whether they were\ndisposed to make battle for their liberty, or whether they should try\nthe milder expedient of conciliation. As it was a subject in which all\nhad an equal interest, he put the question as to a council of war, and\nnot without some slight exhibition of the lingering vestiges of a nearly\nextinct military pride. Paul and the Doctor were diametrically opposed\nto each other in opinion; the former declaring for an immediate appeal\nto arms, and the latter was warmly espousing the policy of pacific\nmeasures. Middleton, who saw that there was great danger of a hot verbal\ndispute between two men, who were governed by feelings so diametrically\nopposed, saw fit to assume the office of arbiter; or rather to decide\nthe question, his situation making him a sort of umpire. He also leaned\nto the side of peace, for he evidently saw that, in consequence of the\nvast superiority of their enemies, violence would irretrievably lead to\ntheir destruction.\n\nThe trapper listened to the reasons of the young soldier with great\nattention; and, as they were given with the steadiness of one who did\nnot suffer apprehension to blind his judgment, they did not fail to\nproduce a suitable impression.\n\n\"It is rational,\" rejoined the trapper, when the other had delivered\nhis reasons; \"it is very rational, for what man cannot move with his\nstrength he must circumvent with his wits. It is reason that makes him\nstronger than the buffaloe, and swifter than the moose. Now stay you\nhere, and keep yourselves close. My life and my traps are but of little\nvalue, when the welfare of so many human souls are concerned; and,\nmoreover, I may say that I know the windings of Indian cunning.\nTherefore will I go alone upon the prairie. It may so happen, that I can\nyet draw the eyes of a Sioux from this spot and give you time and room\nto fly.\"\n\nAs if resolved to listen to no remonstrance, the old man quietly\nshouldered his rifle, and moving leisurely through the thicket, he\nissued on the plain, at a point whence he might first appear before the\neyes of the Siouxes, without exciting their suspicions that he came from\nits cover.\n\nThe instant that the figure of a man dressed in the garb of a hunter,\nand bearing the well known and much dreaded rifle, appeared before the\neyes of the Siouxes, there was a sensible, though a suppressed sensation\nin the band. The artifice of the trapper had so far succeeded, as to\nrender it extremely doubtful whether he came from some point on the open\nprairie, or from the thicket; though the Indians still continued to cast\nfrequent and suspicious glances at the cover. They had made their\nhalt at the distance of an arrow-flight from the bushes; but when the\nstranger came sufficiently nigh to show that the deep coating of red and\nbrown, which time and exposure had given to his features, was laid upon\nthe original colour of a Pale-face, they slowly receded from the spot,\nuntil they reached a distance that might defeat the aim of fire-arms.\n\nIn the mean time the old man continued to advance, until he had got nigh\nenough to make himself heard without difficulty. Here he stopped,\nand dropping his rifle to the earth, he raised his hand with the palm\noutward, in token of peace. After uttering a few words of reproach\nto his hound, who watched the savage group with eyes that seemed to\nrecognise them, he spoke in the Sioux tongue--\n\n\"My brothers are welcome,\" he said, cunningly constituting himself the\nmaster of the region in which they had met, and assuming the offices\nof hospitality. \"They are far from their villages, and are hungry. Will\nthey follow to my lodge, to eat and sleep?\"\n\nNo sooner was his voice heard, than the yell of pleasure, which burst\nfrom a dozen mouths, convinced the sagacious trapper, that he also was\nrecognised. Feeling that it was too late to retreat, he profited by the\nconfusion which prevailed among them, while Weucha was explaining\nhis character, to advance, until he was again face to face with the\nredoubtable Mahtoree. The second interview between these two men, each\nof whom was extraordinary in his way, was marked by the usual caution\nof the frontiers. They stood, for nearly a minute, examining each other\nwithout speaking.\n\n\"Where are your young men?\" sternly demanded the Teton chieftain, after\nhe found that the immovable features of the trapper refused to betray\nany of their master's secrets, under his intimidating look.\n\n\"The Long-knives do not come in bands to trap the beaver? I am alone.\"\n\n\"Your head is white, but you have a forked tongue. Mahtoree has been in\nyour camp. He knows that you are not alone. Where is your young wife,\nand the warrior that I found upon the prairie?\"\n\n\"I have no wife. I have told my brother that the woman and her friend\nwere strangers. The words of a grey head should be heard, and not\nforgotten. The Dahcotahs found travellers asleep, and they thought they\nhad no need of horses. The women and children of a Pale-face are not\nused to go far on foot. Let them be sought where you left them.\"\n\nThe eyes of the Teton flashed fire as he answered--\n\n\"They are gone: but Mahtoree is a wise chief, and his eyes can see a\ngreat distance!\"\n\n\"Does the partisan of the Tetons see men on these naked fields?\"\nretorted the trapper, with great steadiness of mien. \"I am very old,\nand my eyes grow dim. Where do they stand?\" The chief remained silent a\nmoment, as if he disdained to contest any further the truth of a fact,\nconcerning which he was already satisfied. Then pointing to the traces\non the earth, he said, with a sudden transition to mildness, in his eye\nand manner--\n\n\"My father has learnt wisdom, in many winters; can he tell me whose\nmoccasin has left this trail?\"\n\n\"There have been wolves and buffaloes on the prairies; and there may\nhave been cougars too.\"\n\nMahtoree glanced his eye at the thicket, as if he thought the latter\nsuggestion not impossible. Pointing to the place, he ordered his young\nmen to reconnoitre it more closely, cautioning them, at the same time,\nwith a stern look at the trapper, to beware of treachery from the\nBig-knives. Three or four half-naked, eager-looking youths lashed their\nhorses at the word, and darted away to obey the mandate. The old\nman trembled a little for the discretion of Paul, when he saw this\ndemonstration. The Tetons encircled the place two or three times,\napproaching nigher and nigher at each circuit, and then galloped back to\ntheir leader to report that the copse seemed empty. Notwithstanding the\ntrapper watched the eye of Mahtoree, to detect the inward movements\nof his mind, and if possible to anticipate, in order to direct his\nsuspicions, the utmost sagacity of one so long accustomed to study the\ncold habits of the Indian race, could however detect no symptom,\nor expression, that denoted how far he credited or distrusted this\nintelligence. Instead of replying to the information of his scouts,\nhe spoke kindly to his horse, and motioning to a youth to receive the\nbridle, or rather halter, by which he governed the animal, he took the\ntrapper by the arm, and led him a little apart from the rest of the\nband.\n\n\"Has my brother been a warrior?\" said the wily Teton, in a tone that he\nintended should be conciliating.\n\n\"Do the leaves cover the trees in the season of fruits? Go. The\nDahcotahs have not seen as many warriors living as I have looked on\nin their blood! But what signifies idle remembrancing,\" he added in\nEnglish, \"when limbs grow stiff, and sight is failing!\"\n\nThe chief regarded him a moment with a severe look, as if he would lay\nbare the falsehood he had heard; but meeting in the calm eye and steady\nmien of the trapper a confirmation of the truth of what he said, he took\nthe hand of the old man and laid it gently on his head, in token of the\nrespect that was due to the other's years and experience.\n\n\"Why then do the Big-knives tell their red brethren to bury the\ntomahawk,\" he said, \"when their own young men never forget that they are\nbraves, and meet each other so often with bloody hands?\"\n\n\"My nation is more numerous than the buffaloes on the prairies, or the\npigeons in the air. Their quarrels are frequent; yet their warriors\nare few. None go out on the war-path but they who are gifted with the\nqualities of a brave, and therefore such see many battles.\"\n\n\"It is not so--my father is mistaken,\" returned Mahtoree, indulging in\na smile of exulting penetration, at the very instant he corrected the\nforce of his denial, in deference to the years and services of one so\naged. \"The Big-knives are very wise, and they are men; all of them would\nbe warriors. They would leave the Red-skins to dig roots and hoe the\ncorn. But a Dahcotah is not born to live like a woman; he must strike\nthe Pawnee and the Omahaw, or he will lose the name of his fathers.\"\n\n\"The Master of Life looks with an open eye on his children, who die in\na battle that is fought for the right; but he is blind, and his ears are\nshut to the cries of an Indian, who is killed when plundering, or doing\nevil to his neighbour.\"\n\n\"My father is old,\" said Mahtoree, looking at his aged companion, with\nan expression of irony, that sufficiently denoted he was one of those\nwho overstep the trammels of education, and who are perhaps a little\ngiven to abuse the mental liberty they thus obtain. \"He is very old: has\nhe made a journey to the far country; and has he been at the trouble to\ncome back, to tell the young men what he has seen?\"\n\n\"Teton,\" returned the trapper, throwing the breach of his rifle to the\nearth with startling vehemence, and regarding his companion with steady\nserenity, \"I have heard that there are men, among my people, who study\ntheir great medicines until they believe themselves to be gods, and who\nlaugh at all faith except in their own vanities. It may be true. It is\ntrue; for I have seen them. When man is shut up in towns and schools,\nwith his own follies, it may be easy to believe himself greater than the\nMaster of Life; but a warrior, who lives in a house with the clouds for\nits roof, where he can at any moment look both at the heavens and at the\nearth, and who daily sees the power of the Great Spirit, should be more\nhumble. A Dahcotah chieftain ought to be too wise to laugh at justice.\"\n\nThe crafty Mahtoree, who saw that his free-thinking was not likely to\nproduce a favourable impression on the old man, instantly changed his\nground, by alluding to the more immediate subject of their interview.\nLaying his hand gently on the shoulder of the trapper, he led him\nforward, until they both stood within fifty feet of the margin of the\nthicket. Here he fastened his penetrating eyes on the other's honest\ncountenance, and continued the discourse--\n\n\"If my father has hid his young men in the bush, let him tell them to\ncome forth. You see that a Dahcotah is not afraid. Mahtoree is a great\nchief! A warrior, whose head is white, and who is about to go to the\nLand of Spirits, cannot have a tongue with two ends, like a serpent.\"\n\n\"Dahcotah, I have told no lie. Since the Great Spirit made me a man, I\nhave lived in the wilderness, or on these naked plains, without lodge or\nfamily. I am a hunter and go on my path alone.\"\n\n\"My father has a good carabine. Let him point it in the bush and fire.\"\n\nThe old man hesitated a moment, and then slowly prepared himself to give\nthis delicate assurance of the truth of what he said, without which he\nplainly perceived the suspicions of his crafty companion could not be\nlulled. As he lowered his rifle, his eye, although greatly dimmed and\nweakened by age, ran over the confused collection of objects, that\nlay embedded amid the party-coloured foliage of the thicket, until it\nsucceeded in catching a glimpse of the brown covering of the stem of a\nsmall tree. With this object in view, he raised the piece to a level\nand fired. The bullet had no sooner glided from the barrel than a tremor\nseized the hands of the trapper, which, had it occurred a moment sooner,\nwould have utterly disqualified him for so hazardous an experiment. A\nfrightful silence succeeded the report, during which he expected to hear\nthe shrieks of the females, and then, as the smoke whirled away in the\nwind, he caught a view of the fluttering bark, and felt assured that all\nhis former skill was not entirely departed from him. Dropping the piece\nto the earth, he turned again to his companion with an air of the utmost\ncomposure, and demanded--\n\n\"Is my brother satisfied?\"\n\n\"Mahtoree is a chief of the Dahcotahs,\" returned the cunning Teton,\nlaying his hand on his chest, in acknowledgment of the other's\nsincerity. \"He knows that a warrior, who has smoked at so many\ncouncil-fires, until his head has grown white, would not be found in\nwicked company. But did not my father once ride on a horse, like a rich\nchief of the Pale-faces, instead of travelling on foot like a hungry\nKonza?\"\n\n\"Never! The Wahcondah has given me legs, and he has given me resolution\nto use them. For sixty summers and winters did I journey in the woods\nof America, and ten tiresome years have I dwelt on these open fields,\nwithout finding need to call often upon the gifts of the other creatur's\nof the Lord to carry me from place to place.\"\n\n\"If my father has so long lived in the shade, why has he come upon the\nprairies? The sun will scorch him.\"\n\nThe old man looked sorrowfully about for a moment, and then turning with\na confidential air to the other, he replied--\n\n\"I passed the spring, summer, and autumn of life among the trees. The\nwinter of my days had come, and found me where I loved to be, in the\nquiet--ay, and in the honesty of the woods! Teton, then I slept happily,\nwhere my eyes could look up through the branches of the pines and the\nbeeches, to the very dwelling of the Good Spirit of my people. If I\nhad need to open my heart to him, while his fires were burning above my\nhead, the door was open and before my eyes. But the axes of the choppers\nawoke me. For a long time my ears heard nothing but the uproar of\nclearings. I bore it like a warrior and a man; there was a reason that\nI should bear it: but when that reason was ended, I bethought me to\nget beyond the accursed sounds. It was trying to the courage and to\nthe habits, but I had heard of these vast and naked fields, and I came\nhither to escape the wasteful temper of my people. Tell me, Dahcotah,\nhave I not done well?\"\n\nThe trapper laid his long lean finger on the naked shoulder of the\nIndian as he ended, and seemed to demand his felicitations on his\ningenuity and success, with a ghastly smile, in which triumph was\nsingularly blended with regret. His companion listened intently, and\nreplied to the question by saying, in the sententious manner of his\nrace--\n\n\"The head of my father is very grey; he has always lived with men, and\nhe has seen everything. What he does is good; what he speaks is wise.\nNow let him say, is he sure that he is a stranger to the Big-knives, who\nare looking for their beasts on every side of the prairies and cannot\nfind them?\"\n\n\"Dahcotah, what I have said is true. I live alone, and never do I mingle\nwith men whose skins are white, if--\"\n\nHis mouth was suddenly closed by an interruption that was as mortifying\nas it was unexpected. The words were still on his tongue, when the\nbushes on the side of the thicket where they stood, opened, and the\nwhole of the party whom he had just left, and in whose behalf he\nwas endeavouring to reconcile his love of truth to the necessity of\nprevaricating, came openly into view. A pause of mute astonishment\nsucceeded this unlooked-for spectacle. Then Mahtoree, who did not\nsuffer a muscle or a joint to betray the wonder and surprise he actually\nexperienced, motioned towards the advancing friends of the trapper with\nan air of assumed civility, and a smile, that lighted his fierce, dark,\nvisage, as the glare of the setting sun reveals the volume and load\nof the cloud, that is charged to bursting with the electric fluid.\nHe however disdained to speak, or to give any other evidence of his\nintentions than by calling to his side the distant band, who sprang\nforward at his beck, with the alacrity of willing subordinates.\n\nIn the mean time the friends of the old man continued to advance.\nMiddleton himself was foremost, supporting the light and aerial looking\nfigure of Inez, on whose anxious countenance he cast such occasional\nglances of tender interest as, in similar circumstances, a father would\nhave given to his child. Paul led Ellen, close in their rear. But while\nthe eye of the bee-hunter did not neglect his blooming companion, it\nscowled angrily, resembling more the aspect of the sullen and retreating\nbear than the soft intelligence of a favoured suitor. Obed and Asinus\ncame last, the former leading his companion with a degree of fondness\nthat could hardly be said to be exceeded by any other of the party. The\napproach of the naturalist was far less rapid than that of those who\npreceded him. His feet seemed equally reluctant to advance, or to remain\nstationary; his position bearing a great analogy to that of Mahomet's\ncoffin, with the exception that the quality of repulsion rather than\nthat of attraction held him in a state of rest. The repulsive power in\nhis rear however appeared to predominate, and by a singular exception,\nas he would have said himself, to all philosophical principles, it\nrather increased than diminished by distance. As the eyes of the\nnaturalist steadily maintained a position that was the opposite of his\nroute, they served to give a direction to those of the observers of all\nthese movements, and at once furnished a sufficient clue by which to\nunravel the mystery of so sudden a debouchement from the cover.\n\nAnother cluster of stout and armed men was seen at no great distance,\njust rounding a point of the thicket, and moving directly though\ncautiously towards the place where the band of the Siouxes was posted,\nas a squadron of cruisers is often seen to steer across the waste of\nwaters, towards the rich but well-protected convoy. In short, the family\nof the squatter, or at least such among them as were capable of\nbearing arms, appeared in view, on the broad prairie, evidently bent on\nrevenging their wrongs.\n\nMahtoree and his party slowly retired from the thicket, the moment\nthey caught a view of the strangers, until they halted on a swell that\ncommanded a wide and unobstructed view of the naked fields on which they\nstood. Here the Dahcotah appeared disposed to make his stand, and to\nbring matters to an issue. Notwithstanding this retreat, in which he\ncompelled the trapper to accompany him, Middleton still advanced, until\nhe too halted on the same elevation, and within speaking distance of the\nwarlike Siouxes. The borderers in their turn took a favourable position,\nthough at a much greater distance. The three groups now resembled so\nmany fleets at sea, lying with their topsails to the masts, with the\ncommendable precaution of reconnoitring, before each could ascertain who\namong the strangers might be considered as friends, and who as foes.\n\nDuring this moment of suspense, the dark, threatening, eye of Mahtoree\nrolled from one of the strange parties to the other, in keen and hasty\nexamination, and then it turned its withering look on the old man, as\nthe chief said, in a tone of high and bitter scorn--\n\n\"The Big-knives are fools! It is easier to catch the cougar asleep, than\nto find a blind Dahcotah. Did the white head think to ride on the horse\nof a Sioux?\"\n\nThe trapper, who had found time to collect his perplexed faculties, saw\nat once that Middleton, having perceived Ishmael on the trail by which\nthey had fled, preferred trusting to the hospitality of the savages,\nthan to the treatment he would be likely to receive from the hands of\nthe squatter. He therefore disposed himself to clear the way for the\nfavourable reception of his friends, since he found that the unnatural\ncoalition became necessary to secure the liberty, if not the lives, of\nthe party.\n\n\"Did my brother ever go on a war-path to strike my people?\" he calmly\ndemanded of the indignant chief, who still awaited his reply.\n\nThe lowering aspect of the Teton warrior so far lost its severity, as\nto suffer a gleam of pleasure and triumph to lighten its ferocity, as\nsweeping his arm in an entire circle around his person he answered--\n\n\"What tribe or nation has not felt the blows of the Dahcotahs? Mahtoree\nis their partisan.\"\n\n\"And has he found the Big-knives women, or has he found them men?\"\n\nA multitude of fierce passions were struggling in the tawny countenance\nof the Indian. For a moment inextinguishable hatred seemed to hold the\nmastery, and then a nobler expression, and one that better became the\ncharacter of a brave, got possession of his features, and maintained\nitself until, first throwing aside his light robe of pictured deer-skin,\nand pointing to the scar of a bayonet in his breast, he replied--\n\n\"It was given, as it was taken, face to face.\"\n\n\"It is enough. My brother is a brave chief, and he should be wise. Let\nhim look: is that a warrior of the Pale-faces? Was it one such as that\nwho gave the great Dahcotah his hurt?\"\n\nThe eyes of Mahtoree followed the direction of the old man's extended\narm, until they rested on the drooping form of Inez. The look of the\nTeton was long, riveted, and admiring. Like that of the young Pawnee,\nit resembled more the gaze of a mortal on some heavenly image, than the\nadmiration with which man is wont to contemplate even the loveliness\nof woman. Starting, as if suddenly self-convicted of forgetfulness, the\nchief next turned his eyes on Ellen, where they lingered an instant\nwith a much more intelligible expression of admiration, and then pursued\ntheir course until they had taken another glance at each individual of\nthe party.\n\n\"My brother sees that my tongue is not forked,\" continued the\ntrapper, watching the emotions the other betrayed, with a readiness\nof comprehension little inferior to that of the Teton himself. \"The\nBig-knives do not send their women to war. I know that the Dahcotahs\nwill smoke with the strangers.\"\n\n\"Mahtoree is a great chief! The Big-knives are welcome,\" said the Teton,\nlaying his hand on his breast, with an air of lofty politeness that\nwould have done credit to any state of society. \"The arrows of my young\nmen are in their quivers.\"\n\nThe trapper motioned to Middleton to approach, and in a few moments\nthe two parties were blended in one, each of the males having exchanged\nfriendly greetings, after the fashions of the prairie warriors. But,\neven while engaged in this hospitable manner, the Dahcotah did not fail\nto keep a strict watch on the more distant party of white men, as if\nhe still distrusted an artifice, or sought further explanation. The old\nman, in his turn, perceived the necessity of being more explicit, and\nof securing the slight and equivocal advantage he had already obtained.\nWhile affecting to examine the group, which still lingered at the spot\nwhere it had first halted, as if to discover the characters of those\nwho composed it, he plainly saw that Ishmael contemplated immediate\nhostilities. The result of a conflict on the open prairie, between\na dozen resolute border men, and the half-armed natives, even though\nseconded by their white allies, was in his experienced judgment a point\nof great uncertainty, and though far from reluctant to engage in the\nstruggle on account of himself, the aged trapper thought it far more\nworthy of his years, and his character, to avoid than to court the\ncontest. His feelings were, for obvious reasons, in accordance with\nthose of Paul and Middleton, who had lives still more precious than\ntheir own to watch over and protect. In this dilemma the three consulted\non the means of escaping the frightful consequences which might\nimmediately follow a single act of hostility on the part of the\nborderers; the old man taking care that their communication should, in\nthe eyes of those who noted the expression of their countenances with\njealous watchfulness, bear the appearance of explanations as to the\nreason why such a party of travellers was met so far in the deserts.\n\n\"I know that the Dahcotahs are a wise and great people,\" at length the\ntrapper commenced, again addressing himself to the chief; \"but does not\ntheir partisan know a single brother who is base?\"\n\nThe eye of Mahtoree wandered proudly around his band, but rested a\nmoment reluctantly on Weucha, as he answered--\n\n\"The Master of Life has made chiefs, and warriors, and women;\"\nconceiving that he thus embraced all the gradations of human excellence\nfrom the highest to the lowest.\n\n\"And he has also made Pale-faces, who are wicked. Such are they whom my\nbrother sees yonder.\"\n\n\"Do they go on foot to do wrong?\" demanded the Teton, with a wild gleam\nfrom his eyes, that sufficiently betrayed how well he knew the reason\nwhy they were reduced to so humble an expedient.\n\n\"Their beasts are gone. But their powder, and their lead, and their\nblankets remain.\"\n\n\"Do they carry their riches in their hands, like miserable Konzas? or\nare they brave, and leave them with the women, as men should do, who\nknow where to find what they lose?\"\n\n\"My brother sees the spot of blue across the prairie; look, the sun has\ntouched it for the last time to-day.\"\n\n\"Mahtoree is not a mole.\"\n\n\"It is a rock; on it are the goods of the Big-knives.\"\n\nAn expression of savage joy shot into the dark countenance of the Teton\nas he listened; turning to the old man he seemed to read his soul, as\nif to assure himself he was not deceived. Then he bent his look on the\nparty of Ishmael, and counted its number.\n\n\"One warrior is wanting,\" he said.\n\n\"Does my brother see the buzzards? there is his grave. Did he find blood\non the prairie? It was his.\"\n\n\"Enough! Mahtoree is a wise chief. Put your women on the horses of the\nDahcotahs: we shall see, for our eyes are open very wide.\"\n\nThe trapper wasted no unnecessary words in explanation. Familiar with\nthe brevity and promptitude of the natives, he immediately communicated\nthe result to his companions. Paul was mounted in an instant, with Ellen\nat his back. A few more moments were necessary to assure Middleton\nof the security and ease of Inez. While he was thus engaged, Mahtoree\nadvanced to the side of the beast he had allotted to this service, which\nwas his own, and manifested an intention to occupy his customary place\non its back. The young soldier seized the reins of the animal, and\nglances of sudden anger and lofty pride were exchanged between them.\n\n\"No man takes this seat but myself,\" said Middleton, sternly, in\nEnglish.\n\n\"Mahtoree is a great chief!\" retorted the savage; neither comprehending\nthe meaning of the other's words.\n\n\"The Dahcotah will be too late,\" whispered the old man at his elbow;\n\"see; the Big-knives are afraid, and they will soon run.\"\n\nThe Teton chief instantly abandoned his claim, and threw himself on\nanother horse, directing one of his young men to furnish a similar\naccommodation for the trapper. The warriors who were dismounted, got up\nbehind as many of their companions. Doctor Battius bestrode Asinus; and,\nnotwithstanding the brief interruption, in half the time we have taken\nto relate it, the whole party was prepared to move.\n\nWhen he saw that all were ready, Mahtoree gave the signal to advance.\nA few of the best mounted of the warriors, the chief himself included,\nmoved a little in front, and made a threatening demonstration, as if\nthey intended to attack the strangers. The squatter, who was in truth\nslowly retiring, instantly halted his party, and showed a willing front.\nInstead, however, of coming within reach of the dangerous aim of the\nwestern rifle, the subtle savages kept wheeling about the strangers,\nuntil they had made a half circuit, keeping the latter in constant\nexpectation of an assault. Then, perfectly secure of their object, the\nTetons raised a loud shout, and darted across the prairie in a line for\nthe distant rock, with the directness and nearly with the velocity of\nthe arrow, that has just been shot from its bow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n             Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nMahtoree had scarcely given the first intimation of his real design,\nbefore a general discharge from the borderers proved how well they\nunderstood it. The distance, and the rapidity of the flight, however,\nrendered the fire harmless. As a proof how little he regarded the\nhostility of their party, the Dahcotah chieftain answered the report\nwith a yell; and, flourishing his carabine above his head, he made a\ncircuit on the plain, followed by his chosen warriors, in scorn of the\nimpotent attempt of his enemies. As the main body continued the direct\ncourse, this little band of the elite, in returning from its wild\nexhibition of savage contempt, took its place in the rear, with a\ndexterity and a concert of action that showed the manoeuvre had been\ncontemplated.\n\nVolley swiftly succeeded volley, until the enraged squatter was\nreluctantly compelled to abandon the idea of injuring his enemies by\nmeans so feeble. Relinquishing his fruitless attempt, he commenced a\nrapid pursuit, occasionally discharging a rifle in order to give the\nalarm to the garrison, which he had prudently left under the command of\nthe redoubtable Esther herself. In this manner the chase was continued\nfor many minutes, the horsemen gradually gaining on their pursuers, who\nmaintained the race, however, with an incredible power of foot.\n\nAs the little speck of blue rose against the heavens, like an island\nissuing from the deep, the savages occasionally raised a yell of\ntriumph. But the mists of evening were already gathering along the whole\nof the eastern margin of the prairie, and before the band had made half\nof the necessary distance, the dim outline of the rock had melted into\nthe haze of the back ground. Indifferent to this circumstance, which\nrather favoured than disconcerted his plans, Mahtoree, who had again\nridden in front, held on his course with the accuracy of a hound of the\ntruest scent, merely slackening his speed a little, as the horses of his\nparty were by this time thoroughly blown. It was at this stage of the\nenterprise, that the old man rode up to the side of Middleton, and\naddressed him as follows in English--\n\n\"Here is likely to be a thieving business, and one in which I must say I\nhave but little wish to be a partner.\"\n\n\"What would you do? It would be fatal to trust ourselves in the hands of\nthe miscreants in our rear.\"\n\n\"Tut, for miscreants, be they red or be they white. Look ahead, lad,\nas if ye were talking of our medicines, or perhaps praising the Teton\nbeasts. For the knaves love to hear their horses commended, the same as\na foolish mother in the settlements is fond of hearing the praises of\nher wilful child. So; pat the animal and lay your hand on the gewgaws,\nwith which the Red-skins have ornamented his mane, giving your eye as\nit were to one thing, and your mind to another. Listen; if matters are\nmanaged with judgment, we may leave these Tetons as the night sets in.\"\n\n\"A blessed thought!\" exclaimed Middleton, who retained a painful\nremembrance of the look of admiration, with which Mahtoree had\ncontemplated the loveliness of Inez, as well as of his subsequent\npresumption in daring to wish to take the office of her protector on\nhimself.\n\n\"Lord, Lord! what a weak creatur' is man, when the gifts of natur' are\nsmothered in bookish knowledge, and womanly manners! Such another start\nwould tell these imps at our elbows that we were plotting against them,\njust as plainly as if it were whispered in their ears by a Sioux tongue.\nAy, ay, I know the devils; they look as innocent as so many frisky\nfawns, but there is not one among them all that has not an eye on our\nsmallest motions. Therefore, what is to be done is to be done in wisdom,\nin order to circumvent their cunning. That is right; pat his neck and\nsmile, as if you praised the horse, and keep the ear on my side open\nto my words. Be careful not to worry your beast, for though but little\nskilled in horses, reason teaches that breath is needful in a hard push,\nand that a weary leg makes a dull race. Be ready to mind the signal,\nwhen you hear a whine from old Hector. The first will be to make\nready; the second, to edge out of the crowd; and the third, to go--am I\nunderstood?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, perfectly,\" said Middleton, trembling in his excessive\neagerness to put the plan in instant execution, and pressing the\nlittle arm, which encircled his body, to his heart. \"Perfectly. Hasten,\nhasten.\"\n\n\"Ay, the beast is no sloth,\" continued the trapper in the Teton\nlanguage, as if he continued the discourse, edging cautiously through\nthe dusky throng at the same time, until he found himself riding at the\nside of Paul. He communicated his intentions in the same guarded manner\nas before. The high-spirited and fearless bee-hunter received the\nintelligence with delight, declaring his readiness to engage the whole\nof the savage band, should it become necessary to effect their object.\nWhen the old man drew off from the side of this pair also, he cast his\neyes about him to discover the situation occupied by the naturalist.\n\nThe Doctor, with infinite labour to himself and Asinus, had maintained a\nposition in the very centre of the Siouxes, so long as there existed the\nsmallest reason for believing that any of the missiles of Ishmael might\narrive in contact with his person. After this danger had diminished, or\nrather disappeared entirely, his own courage revived, while that of his\nsteed began to droop. To this mutual but very material change was owing\nthe fact, that the rider and the ass were now to be sought among that\nportion of the band who formed a sort of rear-guard. Hither, then, the\ntrapper contrived to turn his steed, without exciting the suspicions of\nany of his subtle companions.\n\n\"Friend,\" commenced the old man, when he found himself in a situation\nfavourable to discourse, \"should you like to pass a dozen years among\nthe savages with a shaved head, and a painted countenance, with,\nperhaps, a couple of wives and five or six children of the half breed,\nto call you father?\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" exclaimed the startled naturalist. \"I am indisposed\nto matrimony in general, and more especially to all admixture of the\nvarieties of species, which only tend to tarnish the beauty and to\ninterrupt the harmony of nature. Moreover, it is a painful innovation on\nthe order of all nomenclatures.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, you have reason enough for your distaste to such a life; but\nshould these Siouxes get you fairly into their village, such would be\nyour luck, as certain as that the sun rises and sets at the pleasure of\nthe Lord.\"\n\n\"Marry me to a woman who is not adorned with the comeliness of the\nspecies!\" responded the Doctor. \"Of what crime have I been guilty,\nthat so grievous a punishment should await the offence? To marry a man\nagainst the movements of his will, is to do a violence to human nature!\"\n\n\"Now, that you speak of natur', I have hopes that the gift of reason has\nnot altogether deserted your brain,\" returned the old man, with a covert\nexpression playing about the angles of his deep set eyes, which betrayed\nhe was not entirely destitute of humour. \"Nay, they may conceive you a\nremarkable subject for their kindness, and for that matter marry you\nto five or six. I have known, in my days, favoured chiefs who had\nnumberless wives.\"\n\n\"But why should they meditate this vengeance?\" demanded the Doctor,\nwhose hair began to rise, as if each fibre was possessed of sensibility;\n\"what evil have I done?\"\n\n\"It is the fashion of their kindness. When they come to learn that you\nare a great medicine, they will adopt you in the tribe, and some mighty\nchief will give you his name, and perhaps his daughter, or it may be a\nwife or two of his own, who have dwelt long in his lodge, and of whose\nvalue he is a judge by experience.\"\n\n\"The Governor and Founder of natural harmony protect me!\" ejaculated the\nDoctor. \"I have no affinity to a single consort, much less to duplicates\nand triplicates of the class! I shall certainly essay a flight from\ntheir abodes before I mingle in so violent a conjunction.\"\n\n\"There is reason in your words; but why not attempt the race you speak\nof now?\"\n\nThe naturalist looked fearfully around, as if he had an inclination to\nmake an instant exhibition of his desperate intention; but the dusky\nfigures, who were riding on every side of him, seemed suddenly tripled\nin number, and the darkness, that was already thickening on the prairie,\nappeared in his eyes to possess the glare of high noon.\n\n\"It would be premature, and reason forbids it,\" he answered. \"Leave me,\nvenerable venator, to the council of my own thoughts, and when my plans\nare properly classed, I will advise you of my resolutions.\"\n\n\"Resolutions!\" repeated the old man, shaking his head a little\ncontemptuously as he gave the rein to his horse, and allowed him to\nmingle with the steeds of the savages. \"Resolution is a word that is\ntalked of in the settlements, and felt on the borders. Does my brother\nknow the beast on which the Pale-face rides?\" he continued, addressing\na gloomy looking warrior in his own tongue, and making a motion with his\narm that at the same time directed his attention to the naturalist and\nthe meek Asinus.\n\nThe Teton turned his eyes for a minute on the animal, but disdained to\nmanifest the smallest portion of that wonder he had felt, in common with\nall his companions, on first viewing so rare a quadruped. The trapper\nwas not ignorant, that while asses and mules were beginning to be known\nto those tribes who dwelt nearest the Mexicos, they were not usually\nencountered so far north as the waters of La Platte. He therefore\nmanaged to read the mute astonishment, that lay so deeply concealed in\nthe tawny visage of the savage, and took his measures accordingly.\n\n\"Does my brother think that the rider is a warrior of the Pale-faces?\"\nhe demanded, when he believed that sufficient time had elapsed, for a\nfull examination of the pacific mien of the naturalist.\n\nThe flash of scorn, which shot across the features of the Teton, was\nvisible, even by the dim light of the stars.\n\n\"Is a Dahcotah a fool?\" was the answer.\n\n\"They are a wise nation, whose eyes are never shut; much do I wonder,\nthat they have not seen the great medicine of the Big-knives!\"\n\n\"Wagh!\" exclaimed his companion, suffering the whole of his amazement to\nburst out of his dark rigid countenance at the surprise, like a flash of\nlightning illuminating the gloom of midnight.\n\n\"The Dahcotah knows that my tongue is not forked. Let him open his eyes\nwider. Does he not see a very great medicine?\"\n\nThe light was not necessary to recall to the savage each feature in the\nreally remarkable costume and equipage of Dr. Battius. In common with\nthe rest of the band, and in conformity with the universal practice\nof the Indians, this warrior, while he had suffered no gaze of\nidle curiosity to disgrace his manhood, had not permitted a single\ndistinctive mark, which might characterise any one of the strangers, to\nescape his vigilance. He knew the air, the stature, the dress, and the\nfeatures, even to the colour of the eyes and of the hair, of every one\nof the Big-knives, whom he had thus strangely encountered, and deeply\nhad he ruminated on the causes, which could have led a party, so\nsingularly constituted, into the haunts of the rude inhabitants of his\nnative wastes. He had already considered the several physical powers\nof the whole party, and had duly compared their abilities with what he\nsupposed might have been their intentions. Warriors they were not, for\nthe Big-knives, like the Siouxes, left their women in their villages\nwhen they went out on the bloody path. The same objections applied to\nthem as hunters, and even as traders, the two characters under which the\nwhite men commonly appeared in their villages. He had heard of a\ngreat council, at which the Menahashah, or Long-knives, and the\nWashsheomantiqua, or Spaniards, had smoked together, when the latter\nhad sold to the former their incomprehensible rights over those vast\nregions, through which his nation had roamed, in freedom, for so many\nages. His simple mind had not been able to embrace the reasons why one\npeople should thus assume a superiority over the possessions of another,\nand it will readily be perceived, that at the hint just received from\nthe trapper, he was not indisposed to fancy that some of the hidden\nsubtilty of that magical influence, of which he was so firm a believer,\nwas about to be practised by the unsuspecting subject of their\nconversation, in furtherance of these mysterious claims. Abandoning,\ntherefore, all the reserve and dignity of his manner, under the\nconscious helplessness of ignorance, he turned to the old man, and\nstretching forth his arms, as if to denote how much he lay at his mercy,\nhe said--\n\n\"Let my father look at me. I am a wild man of the prairies; my body\nis naked; my hands empty; my skin red. I have struck the Pawnees, the\nKonzas, the Omahaws, the Osages, and even the Long-knives. I am a man\namid warriors, but a woman among the conjurors. Let my father speak: the\nears of the Teton are open. He listens like a deer to the step of the\ncougar.\"\n\n\"Such are the wise and uns'archable ways of One who alone knows good\nfrom evil!\" exclaimed the trapper, in English. \"To some He grants\ncunning, and on others He bestows the gift of manhood! It is humbling,\nand it is afflicting to see so noble a creatur' as this, who has fou't\nin many a bloody fray, truckling before his superstition like a beggar\nasking for the bones you would throw to the dogs. The Lord will forgive\nme for playing with the ignorance of the savage, for He knows I do it in\nno mockery of his state, or in idle vaunting of my own; but in order to\nsave mortal life, and to give justice to the wronged, while I defeat the\ndeviltries of the wicked! Teton,\" speaking again in the language of the\nlistener, \"I ask you, is not that a wonderful medicine? If the Dahcotahs\nare wise, they will not breathe the air he breathes, nor touch his\nrobes. They know, that the Wahconshecheh (bad spirit) loves his own\nchildren, and will not turn his back on him that does them harm.\"\n\nThe old man delivered this opinion in an ominous and sententious manner,\nand then rode apart as if he had said enough. The result justified his\nexpectations. The warrior, to whom he had addressed himself, was\nnot slow to communicate his important knowledge to the rest of the\nrear-guard, and, in a very few moments, the naturalist was the object of\ngeneral observation and reverence. The trapper, who understood that the\nnatives often worshipped, with a view to propitiate, the evil spirit,\nawaited the workings of his artifice, with the coolness of one who had\nnot the smallest interest in its effects. It was not long before he saw\none dark figure after another, lashing his horse and galloping ahead\ninto the centre of the band, until Weucha alone remained nigh the\npersons of himself and Obed. The very dulness of this grovelling-minded\nsavage, who continued gazing at the supposed conjuror with a sort of\nstupid admiration, opposed now the only obstacle to the complete success\nof his artifice.\n\nThoroughly understanding the character of this Indian, the old man lost\nno time in getting rid of him also. Riding to his side he said, in an\naffected whisper--\n\n\"Has Weucha drunk of the milk of the Big-knives, to-day?\"\n\n\"Hugh!\" exclaimed the savage, every dull thought instantly recalled from\nheaven to earth by the question.\n\n\"Because the great captain of my people, who rides in front, has a cow\nthat is never empty. I know it will not be long before he will say, Are\nany of my red brethren dry?\"\n\nThe words were scarcely uttered, before Weucha, in his turn, quickened\nthe gait of his beast, and was soon blended with the rest of the dark\ngroup, who were riding, at a more moderate pace, a few rods in advance.\nThe trapper, who knew how fickle and sudden were the changes of a savage\nmind, did not lose a moment in profiting by this advantage. He loosened\nthe reins of his own impatient steed, and in an instant he was again at\nthe side of Obed.\n\n\"Do you see the twinkling star, that is, may be, the length of four\nrifles above the prairie; hereaway, to the North I mean?\"\n\n\"Ay, it is of the constellation---\"\n\n\"A tut for your constellations, man; do you see the star I mean? Tell\nme, in the English of the land, yes or no.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The moment my back is turned, pull upon the rein of your ass, until you\nlose sight of the savages. Then take the Lord for your dependence, and\nyonder star for your guide. Turn neither to the right hand, nor to the\nleft, but make diligent use of your time, for your beast is not quick\nof foot, and every inch of prairie you gain, is a day added to your\nliberty, or to your life.\"\n\nWithout waiting to listen to the queries, which the naturalist was about\nto put, the old man again loosened the reins of his horse, and presently\nhe too was blended with the group in front.\n\nObed was now alone. Asinus willingly obeyed the hint which his\nmaster soon gave, rather in desperation than with any very collected\nunderstanding of the orders he had received, and checked his pace\naccordingly. As the Tetons however rode at a hand-gallop, but a moment\nof time was necessary, after the ass began to walk, to remove them\neffectually from before the vision of his rider. Without plan,\nexpectation, or hope of any sort, except that of escaping from his\ndangerous neighbours, the Doctor first feeling, to assure himself that\nthe package, which contained the miserable remnants of his specimens\nand notes was safe at his crupper, turned the head of the beast in the\nrequired direction, and kicking him with a species of fury, he soon\nsucceeded in exciting the speed of the patient animal into a smart run.\nHe had barely time to descend into a hollow and ascend the adjoining\nswell of the prairie, before he heard, or fancied he heard, his name\nshouted, in good English, from the throats of twenty Tetons. The\ndelusion gave a new impulse to his ardour; and no professor of the\nsaltant art ever applied himself with greater industry, than the\nnaturalist now used his heels on the ribs of Asinus. The conflict\nendured for several minutes without interruption, and to all appearances\nit might have continued to the present moment, had not the meek temper\nof the beast become unduly excited. Borrowing an idea from the manner\nin which his master exhibited his agitation, Asinus so far changed the\napplication of his own heels, as to raise them simultaneously with\na certain indignant flourish into the air, a measure that instantly\ndecided the controversy in his favour. Obed took leave of his seat, as\nof a position no longer tenable, continuing, however, the direction\nof his flight, while the ass, like a conqueror, took possession of the\nfield of battle, beginning to crop the dry herbage, as the fruits of\nvictory.\n\nWhen Doctor Battius had recovered his feet, and rallied his faculties,\nwhich were in a good deal of disorder from the hurried manner in which\nhe had abandoned his former situation, he returned in quest of his\nspecimens and of his ass. Asinus displayed enough of magnanimity to\nrender the interview amicable, and thenceforth the naturalist continued\nthe required route with very commendable industry, but with a much more\ntempered discretion.\n\nIn the mean time, the old trapper had not lost sight of the important\nmovements that he had undertaken to control. Obed had not been\nmistaken in supposing that he was already missed and sought, though\nhis imagination had corrupted certain savage cries into the well-known\nsounds that composed his own latinized name. The truth was simply this.\nThe warriors of the rearguard had not failed to apprise those in front\nof the mysterious character, with which it had pleased the trapper to\ninvest the unsuspecting naturalist. The same untutored admiration, which\non the receipt of this intelligence had driven those in the rear to the\nfront, now drove many of the front to the rear. The Doctor was of course\nabsent, and the outcry was no more than the wild yells, which were\nraised in the first burst of savage disappointment.\n\nBut the authority of Mahtoree was prompt to aid the ingenuity of the\ntrapper, in suppressing these dangerous sounds. When order was restored,\nand the former was made acquainted with the reason why his young men had\nbetrayed so strong a mark of indiscretion, the old man, who had taken\na post at his elbow, saw, with alarm, the gleam of keen distrust that\nflashed in his swarthy visage.\n\n\"Where is your conjuror?\" demanded the chief, turning suddenly to the\ntrapper, as if he meant to make him responsible for the re-appearance of\nObed.\n\n\"Can I tell my brother the number of the stars? The ways of a great\nmedicine are not like the ways of other men.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, grey-head, and count my words,\" continued the other,\nbending on his rude saddle-bow, like some chevalier of a more civilised\nrace, and speaking in the haughty tones of absolute power; \"the\nDahcotahs have not chosen a woman for their chief; when Mahtoree feels\nthe power of a great medicine, he will tremble; until then he will look\nwith his own eyes, without borrowing sight from a Pale-face. If your\nconjuror is not with his friends in the morning, my young men shall look\nfor him. Your ears are open. Enough.\"\n\nThe trapper was not sorry to find that so long a respite was granted. He\nhad before found reason to believe, that the Teton partisan was one of\nthose bold spirits, who overstep the limits which use and education\nfix to the opinions of man, in every state of society, and he now saw\nplainly that he must adopt some artifice to deceive him, different\nfrom that which had succeeded so well with his followers. The sudden\nappearance of the rock, however, which hove up, a bleak and ragged mass,\nout of the darkness ahead, put an end for the present to the discourse,\nMahtoree giving all his thoughts to the execution of his designs on the\nrest of the squatter's movables. A murmur ran through the band, as each\ndark warrior caught a glimpse of the desired haven, after which the\nnicest ear might have listened in vain, to catch a sound louder than the\nrustling of feet among the tall grass of the prairie.\n\nBut the vigilance of Esther was not easily deceived. She had long\nlistened anxiously to the suspicious sounds, which approached the rock\nacross the naked waste, nor had the sudden outcry been unheard by the\nunwearied sentinels of the rock. The savages, who had dismounted at some\nlittle distance, had not time to draw around the base of the hill in\ntheir customary silent and insidious manner, before the voice of the\nAmazon was raised, demanding--\n\n\"Who is beneath? Answer, for your lives! Siouxes or devils, I fear ye\nnot!\"\n\nNo answer was given to this challenge, every warrior halting where he\nstood, confident that his dusky form was blended with the shadows of the\nplain. It was at this moment that the trapper determined to escape. He\nhad been left with the rest of his friends, under the surveillance of\nthose who were assigned to the duty of watching the horses, and as they\nall continued mounted, the moment appeared favourable to his project.\nThe attention of the guards was drawn to the rock, and a heavy cloud\ndriving above them at that instant, obscured even the feeble light\nwhich fell from the stars. Leaning on the neck of his horse, the old man\nmuttered--\n\n\"Where is my pup? Where is it--Hector--where is it, dog?\"\n\nThe hound caught the well-known sounds, and answered by a whine of\nfriendship, which threatened to break out into one of his piercing\nhowls. The trapper was in the act of raising himself from this\nsuccessful exploit, when he felt the hand of Weucha grasping his throat,\nas if determined to suppress his voice by the very unequivocal process\nof strangulation. Profiting by the circumstance, he raised another\nlow sound, as in the natural effort of breathing, which drew a second\nresponsive cry from the faithful hound. Weucha instantly abandoned his\nhold of the master in order to wreak his vengeance on the dog. But the\nvoice of Esther was again heard, and every other design was abandoned in\norder to listen.\n\n\"Ay, whine and deform your throats as you may, ye imps of darkness,\" she\nsaid, with a cracked but scornful laugh; \"I know ye; tarry, and ye shall\nhave light for your misdeeds. Put in the coal, Phoebe; put in the coal;\nyour father and the boys shall see that they are wanted at home, to\nwelcome their guests.\"\n\nAs she spoke, a strong light, like that of a brilliant star, was seen\non the very pinnacle of the rock; then followed a forked flame, which\ncurled for a moment amid the windings of an enormous pile of brush,\nand flashing upward in an united sheet, it wavered to and fro, in\nthe passing air, shedding a bright glare on every object within its\ninfluence. A taunting laugh was heard from the height, in which the\nvoices of all ages mingled, as though they triumphed at having so\nsuccessfully exposed the treacherous intentions of the Tetons.\n\nThe trapper looked about him to ascertain in what situations he might\nfind his friends. True to the signals, Middleton and Paul had drawn\na little apart, and now stood ready, by every appearance, to commence\ntheir flight at the third repetition of the cry. Hector had escaped his\nsavage pursuer, and was again crouching at the heels of his master's\nhorse. But the broad circle of light was gradually increasing in extent\nand power, and the old man, whose eye and judgment so rarely failed him,\npatiently awaited a more propitious moment for his enterprise.\n\n\"Now, Ishmael, my man, if sight and hand ar' true as ever, now is the\ntime to work upon these Redskins, who claim to own all your property,\neven to wife and children! Now, my good man, prove both breed and\ncharacter!\"\n\nA distant shout was heard in the direction of the approaching party\nof the squatter, assuring the female garrison that succour was not far\ndistant. Esther answered to the grateful sounds by a cracked cry of her\nown, lifting her form, in the first burst of exultation, above the rock\nin a manner to be visible to all below. Not content with this dangerous\nexposure of her person, she was in the act of tossing her arms in\ntriumph, when the dark figure of Mahtoree shot into the light and\npinioned them to her side. The forms of three other warriors glided\nacross the top of the rock, looking like naked demons flitting among the\nclouds. The air was filled with the brands of the beacon, and a heavy\ndarkness succeeded, not unlike that of the appalling instant, when the\nlast rays of the sun are excluded by the intervening mass of the moon.\nA yell of triumph burst from the savages in their turn, and was rather\naccompanied than followed by a long, loud whine from Hector.\n\nIn an instant the old man was between the horses of Middleton and Paul,\nextending a hand to the bridle of each, in order to check the impatience\nof their riders.\n\n\"Softly, softly,\" he whispered, \"their eyes are as marvellously shut for\nthe minute, as if the Lord had stricken them blind; but their ears are\nopen. Softly, softly; for fifty rods, at least, we must move no faster\nthan a walk.\"\n\nThe five minutes of doubt that succeeded appeared like an age to all but\nthe trapper. As their sight was gradually restored, it seemed to each\nthat the momentary gloom, which followed the extinction of the beacon,\nwas to be replaced by as broad a light as that of noon-day. Gradually\nthe old man, however, suffered the animals to quicken their steps, until\nthey had gained the centre of one of the prairie bottoms. Then laughing\nin his quiet manner he released the reins and said--\n\n\"Now, let them give play to their legs; but keep on the old fog to\ndeaden the sounds.\"\n\nIt is needless to say how cheerfully he was obeyed. In a few more\nminutes they ascended and crossed a swell of the land, after which the\nflight was continued at the top of their horses' speed, keeping the\nindicated star in view, as the labouring bark steers for the light which\npoints the way to a haven and security.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n              The clouds and sunbeams o'er his eye,\n              That once their shades and glories threw,\n              Have left, in yonder silent sky,\n              No vestige where they flew.\n                                                   --Montgomery.\n\nA stillness, as deep as that which marked the gloomy wastes in their\nfront, was observed by the fugitives to distinguish the spot they had\njust abandoned. Even the trapper lent his practised faculties, in\nvain, to detect any of the well-known signs, which might establish\nthe important fact that hostilities had actually commenced between the\nparties of Mahtoree and Ishmael; but their horses carried them out of\nthe reach of sounds, without the occurrence of the smallest evidence of\nthe sort. The old man, from time to time, muttered his discontent, but\nmanifested the uneasiness he actually entertained in no other manner,\nunless it might be in exhibiting a growing anxiety to urge the animals\nto increase their speed. He pointed out in passing, the deserted swale,\nwhere the family of the squatter had encamped, the night they were\nintroduced to the reader, and afterwards he maintained an ominous\nsilence; ominous, because his companions had already seen enough of\nhis character, to be convinced that the circumstances must be critical\nindeed, which possessed the power to disturb the well regulated\ntranquillity of the old man's mind.\n\n\"Have we not done enough,\" Middleton demanded, in tenderness to the\ninability of Inez and Ellen to endure so much fatigue, at the end of\nsome hours; \"we have ridden hard, and have crossed a wide tract of\nplain. It is time to seek a place of rest.\"\n\n\"You must seek it then in Heaven, if you find yourselves unequal to\na longer march,\" murmured the old trapper. \"Had the Tetons and the\nsquatter come to blows, as any one might see in the natur' of things\nthey were bound to do, there would be time to look about us, and to\ncalculate not only the chances but the comforts of the journey; but as\nthe case actually is, I should consider it certain death, or endless\ncaptivity, to trust our eyes with sleep, until our heads are fairly hid\nin some uncommon cover.\"\n\n\"I know not,\" returned the youth, who reflected more on the sufferings\nof the fragile being he supported, than on the experience of his\ncompanion; \"I know not; we have ridden leagues, and I can see no\nextraordinary signs of danger:--if you fear for yourself, my good\nfriend, believe me you are wrong, for--\"\n\n\"Your grand'ther, were he living and here,\" interrupted the old man,\nstretching forth a hand, and laying a finger impressively on the arm of\nMiddleton, \"would have spared those words. He had some reason to think\nthat, in the prime of my days, when my eye was quicker than the hawk's,\nand my limbs were as active as the legs of the fallow-deer, I never\nclung too eagerly and fondly to life: then why should I now feel such a\nchildish affection for a thing that I know to be vain, and the companion\nof pain and sorrow. Let the Tetons do their worst; they will not find\na miserable and worn out trapper the loudest in his complaints, or his\nprayers.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, my worthy, my inestimable friend,\" exclaimed the repentant\nyoung man, warmly grasping the hand, which the other was in the act of\nwithdrawing; \"I knew not what I said--or rather I thought only of those\nwhose tenderness we are most bound to consider.\"\n\n\"Enough. It is natur', and it is right. Therein your grand'ther would\nhave done the very same. Ah's me! what a number of seasons, hot and\ncold, wet and dry, have rolled over my poor head, since the time we\nworried it out together, among the Red Hurons of the Lakes, back in\nthose rugged mountains of Old York! and many a noble buck has since that\nday fallen by my hand; ay, and many a thieving Mingo, too! Tell me, lad,\ndid the general, for general I know he got to be, did he ever tell you\nof the deer we took, that night the outlyers of the accursed tribe\ndrove us to the caves, on the island, and how we feasted and drunk in\nsecurity?\"\n\n\"I have often heard him mention the smallest circumstance of the night\nyou mean; but--\"\n\n\"And the singer; and his open throat; and his shoutings in the fights!\"\ncontinued the old man, laughing joyously at the strength of his own\nrecollections.\n\n\"All--all--he forgot nothing, even to the most trifling incident. Do you\nnot--\"\n\n\"What! did he tell you of the imp behind the log and of the miserable\ndevil who went over the fall--or of the wretch in the tree?\"\n\n\"Of each and all, with every thing that concerned them.[*] I should\nthink--\"\n\n    [*] They who have read the preceding books, in which, the trapper\n    appears as a hunter and a scout, will readily understand the\n    allusions.\n\n\"Ay,\" continued the old man, in a voice, which betrayed how powerfully\nhis own faculties retained the impression of the spectacle, \"I have\nbeen a dweller in forests, and in the wilderness for three-score and ten\nyears, and if any can pretend to know the world, or to have seen scary\nsights, it is myself! But never, before nor since, have I seen human\nman in such a state of mortal despair as that very savage; and yet he\nscorned to speak, or to cry out, or to own his forlorn condition! It is\ntheir gift, and nobly did he maintain it!\"\n\n\"Harkee, old trapper,\" interrupted Paul, who, content with the knowledge\nthat his waist was grasped by one of the arms of Ellen, had hitherto\nridden in unusual silence; \"my eyes are as true and as delicate as a\nhumming-bird's in the day; but they are nothing worth boasting of by\nstarlight. Is that a sick buffaloe, crawling along in the bottom, there,\nor is it one of the stray cattle of the savages?\"\n\nThe whole party drew up, in order to examine the object, which Paul\nhad pointed out. During most of the time, they had ridden in the little\nvales in order to seek the protection of the shadows, but just at that\nmoment, they had ascended a roll of the prairie in order to cross into\nthe very bottom where this unknown animal was now seen.\n\n\"Let us descend,\" said Middleton; \"be it beast or man, we are too strong\nto have any cause of fear.\"\n\n\"Now, if the thing was not morally impossible,\" cried the trapper, who\nthe reader must have already discovered was not always exact in the use\nof qualifying words, \"if the thing was not morally impossible, I should\nsay, that was the man, who journeys in search of reptiles and insects:\nour fellow-traveller the Doctor.\"\n\n\"Why impossible? did you not direct him to pursue this course, in order\nto rejoin us?\"\n\n\"Ay, but I did not tell him to make an ass outdo the speed of a\nhorse:--you are right--you are right,\" said the trapper, interrupting\nhimself, as by gradually lessening the distance between them, his eyes\nassured him it was Obed and Asinus, whom he saw; \"you are right, as\ncertainly as the thing is a miracle. Lord, what a thing is fear! How\nnow, friend; you have been industrious to have got so far ahead in so\nshort a time. I marvel at the speed of the ass!\"\n\n\"Asinus is overcome,\" returned the naturalist, mournfully. \"The animal\nhas certainly not been idle since we separated, but he declines all my\nadmonitions and invitations to proceed. I hope there is no instant fear\nfrom the savages?\"\n\n\"I cannot say that; I cannot say that; matters are not as they should\nbe, atween the squatter and the Tetons, nor will I answer as yet for the\nsafety of any scalp among us. The beast is broken down! you have urged\nhim beyond his natural gifts, and he is like a worried hound. There is\npity and discretion in all things, even though a man be riding for his\nlife.\"\n\n\"You indicated the star,\" returned the Doctor, \"and I deemed it\nexpedient to use great diligence in pursuing the direction.\"\n\n\"Did you expect to reach it, by such haste? Go, go; you talk boldly of\nthe creatur's of the Lord, though I plainly see you are but a child in\nmatters that concern their gifts and instincts. What a plight would\nyou now be in, if there was need for a long and a quick push with our\nheels?\"\n\n\"The fault exists in the formation of the quadruped,\" said Obed, whose\nplacid temper began to revolt under so many scandalous imputations. \"Had\nthere been rotary levers for two of the members, a moiety of the fatigue\nwould have been saved, for one item--\"\n\n\"That, for your moiety's and rotaries, and items, man; a jaded ass is\na jaded ass, and he who denies it is but a brother of the beast itself.\nNow, captain, are we driven to choose one of two evils. We must either\nabandon this man, who has been too much with us through good and bad to\nbe easily cast away, or we must seek a cover to let the animal rest.\"\n\n\"Venerable venator!\" exclaimed the alarmed Obed; \"I conjure you by all\nthe secret sympathies of our common nature, by all the hidden--\"\n\n\"Ah, fear has brought him to talk a little rational sense! It is not\nnatur', truly, to abandon a brother in distress; and the Lord He knows\nthat I have never yet done the shameful deed. You are right, friend, you\nare right; we must all be hidden, and that speedily. But what to do with\nthe ass! Friend Doctor, do you truly value the life of the creatur'?\"\n\n\"He is an ancient and faithful servant,\" returned the disconsolate\nObed, \"and with pain should I see him come to any harm. Fetter his lower\nlimbs, and leave him to repose in this bed of herbage. I will engage he\nshall be found where he is left, in the morning.\"\n\n\"And the Siouxes? What would become of the beast should any of the\nred imps catch a peep at his ears, growing up out of the grass like to\nmullein-tops?\" cried the bee-hunter. \"They would stick him as full of\narrows, as a woman's cushion is full of pins, and then believe they\nhad done the job for the father of all rabbits! My word for it out they\nwould find out their blunder at the first mouthful!\"\n\nMiddleton, who began to grow impatient under the protracted discussion,\ninterposed, and, as a good deal of deference was paid to his rank, he\nquickly prevailed in his efforts to effect a sort of compromise. The\nhumble Asinus, too meek and too weary to make any resistance, was soon\ntethered and deposited in his bed of dying grass, where he was left with\na perfect confidence on the part of his master of finding him, again, at\nthe expiration of a few hours. The old man strongly remonstrated against\nthis arrangement, and more than once hinted that the knife was much more\ncertain than the tether, but the petitions of Obed, aided perhaps by the\nsecret reluctance of the trapper to destroy the beast, were the means\nof saving its life. When Asinus was thus secured, and as his master\nbelieved secreted, the whole party proceeded to find some place where\nthey might rest themselves, during the time required for the repose of\nthe animal.\n\nAccording to the calculations of the trapper, they had ridden twenty\nmiles since the commencement of their flight. The delicate frame of Inez\nbegan to droop under the excessive fatigue, nor was the more robust, but\nstill feminine person of Ellen, insensible to the extraordinary effort\nshe had made. Middleton himself was not sorry to repose, nor did the\nvigorous and high-spirited Paul hesitate to confess that he should be\nall the better for a little rest. The old man alone seemed indifferent\nto the usual claims of nature. Although but little accustomed to the\nunusual description of exercise he had just been taking, he appeared\nto bid defiance to all the usual attacks of human infirmities. Though\nevidently so near its dissolution, his attenuated frame still stood like\nthe shaft of seasoned oak, dry, naked, and tempest-driven, but unbending\nand apparently indurated to the consistency of stone. On the present\noccasion he conducted the search for a resting-place, which was\nimmediately commenced, with all the energy of youth, tempered by the\ndiscretion and experience of his great age.\n\nThe bed of grass, in which the Doctor had been met, and in which his ass\nhad just been left, was followed a little distance until it was found\nthat the rolling swells of the prairie were melting away into one vast\nlevel plain, that was covered, for miles on miles, with the same species\nof herbage.\n\n\"Ah, this may do, this may do,\" said the old man, when they arrived on\nthe borders of this sea of withered grass. \"I know the spot, and often\nhave I lain in its secret holes, for days at a time, while the savages\nhave been hunting the buffaloes on the open ground. We must enter it\nwith great care, for a broad trail might be seen, and Indian curiosity\nis a dangerous neighbour.\"\n\nLeading the way himself, he selected a spot where the tall coarse\nherbage stood most erect, growing not unlike a bed of reeds, both in\nheight and density. Here he entered, singly, directing the others to\nfollow as nearly as possible in his own footsteps. When they had paused\nfor some hundred or two feet into the wilderness of weeds, he gave his\ndirections to Paul and Middleton, who continued a direct route deeper\ninto the place, while he dismounted and returned on his tracks to the\nmargin of the meadow. Here he passed many minutes in replacing the\ntrodden grass, and in effacing, as far as possible, every evidence of\ntheir passage.\n\nIn the mean time the rest of the party continued their progress, not\nwithout toil, and consequently at a very moderate gait, until they had\npenetrated a mile into the place. Here they found a spot suited to their\ncircumstances, and, dismounting, they began to make their dispositions\nto pass the remainder of the night. By this time the trapper\nhad rejoined the party, and again resumed the direction of their\nproceedings.\n\nThe weeds and grass were soon plucked and cut from an area of sufficient\nextent, and a bed for Inez and Ellen was speedily made, a little apart,\nwhich for sweetness and ease might have rivalled one of down. The\nexhausted females, after receiving some light refreshments from the\nprovident stores of Paul and the old man, now sought their repose,\nleaving their more stout companions at liberty to provide for their own\nnecessities. Middleton and Paul were not long in following the example\nof their betrothed, leaving the trapper and the naturalist still seated\naround a savoury dish of bison's meat, which had been cooked at a\nprevious halt, and which was, as usual, eaten cold.\n\nA certain lingering sensation, which had so long been uppermost in the\nmind of Obed, temporarily banished sleep; and as for the old man, his\nwants were rendered, by habit and necessity, as seemingly subject to his\nwill as if they altogether depended on the pleasure of the moment. Like\nhis companion he chose therefore to watch, instead of sleeping.\n\n\"If the children of ease and security knew the hardships and dangers the\nstudents of nature encounter in their behalf,\" said Obed, after a moment\nof silence, when Middleton took his leave for the night, \"pillars\nof silver, and statues of brass would be reared as the everlasting\nmonuments of their glory!\"\n\n\"I know not, I know not,\" returned his companion; \"silver is far from\nplenty, at least in the wilderness, and your brazen idols are forbidden\nin the commandments of the Lord.\"\n\n\"Such indeed was the opinion of the great lawgiver of the Jews, but the\nEgyptians, and the Chaldeans, the Greeks, and the Romans, were wont to\nmanifest their gratitude, in these types of the human form. Indeed many\nof the illustrious masters of antiquity, have by the aid of science\nand skill, even outdone the works of nature, and exhibited a beauty\nand perfection in the human form that are difficult to be found in the\nrarest living specimens of any of the species; genus, homo.\"\n\n\"Can your idols walk or speak, or have they the glorious gift of\nreason?\" demanded the trapper, with some indignation in his voice;\n\"though but little given to run into the noise and chatter of the\nsettlements, yet have I been into the towns in my day, to barter the\npeltry for lead and powder, and often have I seen your waxen dolls, with\ntheir tawdry clothes and glass eyes--\"\n\n\"Waxen dolls!\" interrupted Obed; \"it is profanation, in the view of the\narts, to liken the miserable handy-work of the dealers in wax to the\npure models of antiquity!\"\n\n\"It is profanation in the eyes of the Lord,\" retorted the old man, \"to\nliken the works of his creatur's, to the power of his own hand.\"\n\n\"Venerable venator,\" resumed the naturalist, clearing his throat, like\none who was much in earnest, \"let us discuss understandingly and in\namity. You speak of the dross of ignorance, whereas my memory dwells\non those precious jewels, which it was my happy fortune, formerly, to\nwitness, among the treasured glories of the Old World.\"\n\n\"Old World!\" retorted the trapper, \"that is the miserable cry of all the\nhalf-starved miscreants that have come into this blessed land, since the\ndays of my boyhood! They tell you of the Old World; as if the Lord had\nnot the power and the will to create the universe in a day, or as if he\nhad not bestowed his gifts with an equal hand, though not with an equal\nmind, or equal wisdom, have they been received and used. Were they to\nsay a worn out, and an abused, and a sacrilegious world, they might not\nbe so far from the truth!\"\n\nDoctor Battius, who found it quite as arduous a task to maintain any\nof his favourite positions with so irregular an antagonist, as he would\nhave found it difficult to keep his feet within the hug of a western\nwrestler, hemmed aloud, and profited by the new opening the trapper had\nmade, to shift the grounds of the discussion--\n\n\"By Old and New World, my excellent associate,\" he said, \"it is not to\nbe understood that the hills, and the valleys, the rocks and the rivers\nof our own moiety of the earth do not, physically speaking, bear a date\nas ancient as the spot on which the bricks of Babylon are found; it\nmerely signifies that its moral existence is not co-equal with its\nphysical, or geological formation.\"\n\n\"Anan!\" said the old man, looking up enquiringly into the face of the\nphilosopher.\n\n\"Merely that it has not been so long known in morals, as the other\ncountries of Christendom.\"\n\n\"So much the better, so much the better. I am no great admirator of your\nold morals, as you call them, for I have ever found, and I have liv'd\nlong as it were in the very heart of natur', that your old morals are\nnone of the best. Mankind twist and turn the rules of the Lord, to suit\ntheir own wickedness, when their devilish cunning has had too much time\nto trifle with His commands.\"\n\n\"Nay, venerable hunter, still am I not comprehended. By morals I do\nnot mean the limited and literal signification of the term, such as\nis conveyed in its synonyme, morality, but the practices of men, as\nconnected with their daily intercourse, their institutions, and their\nlaws.\"\n\n\"And such I call barefaced and downright wantonness and waste,\"\ninterrupted his sturdy disputant.\n\n\"Well, be it so,\" returned the Doctor, abandoning the explanation in\ndespair. \"Perhaps I have conceded too much,\" he then instantly added,\nfancying that he still saw the glimmerings of an argument through\nanother chink in the discourse. \"Perhaps I have conceded too much, in\nsaying that this hemisphere is literally as old in its formation, as\nthat which embraces the venerable quarters of Europe, Asia, and Africa.\"\n\n\"It is easy to say a pine is not so tall as an alder, but it would be\nhard to prove. Can you give a reason for such a belief?\"\n\n\"The reasons are numerous and powerful,\" returned the Doctor, delighted\nby this encouraging opening. \"Look into the plains of Egypt and Arabia;\ntheir sandy deserts teem with the monuments of their antiquity; and then\nwe have also recorded documents of their glory; doubling the proofs of\ntheir former greatness, now that they lie stripped of their fertility;\nwhile we look in vain for similar evidences that man has ever reached\nthe summit of civilisation on this continent, or search, without our\nreward, for the path by which he has made the downward journey to his\npresent condition of second childhood.\"\n\n\"And what see you in all this?\" demanded the trapper, who, though a\nlittle confused by the terms of his companion, seized the thread of his\nideas.\n\n\"A demonstration of my problem, that nature did not make so vast a\nregion to lie an uninhabited waste so many ages. This is merely the\nmoral view of the subject; as to the more exact and geological--\"\n\n\"Your morals are exact enough for me,\" returned the old man, \"for I\nthink I see in them the very pride of folly. I am but little gifted in\nthe fables of what you call the Old World, seeing that my time has been\nmainly passed looking natur' steadily in the face, and in reasoning on\nwhat I've seen, rather than on what I've heard in traditions. But I have\nnever shut my ears to the words of the good book, and many is the long\nwinter evening that I have passed in the wigwams of the Delawares,\nlistening to the good Moravians, as they dealt forth the history and\ndoctrines of the elder times, to the people of the Lenape! It was\npleasant to hearken to such wisdom after a weary hunt! Right pleasant\ndid I find it, and often have I talked the matter over with the Great\nSerpent of the Delawares, in the more peaceful hours of our out-lyings,\nwhether it might be on the trail of a war-party of the Mingoes, or on\nthe watch for a York deer. I remember to have heard it, then and there,\nsaid, that the Blessed Land was once fertile as the bottoms of the\nMississippi, and groaning with its stores of grain and fruits; but\nthat the judgment has since fallen upon it, and that it is now more\nremarkable for its barrenness than any qualities to boast of.\"\n\n\"It is true; but Egypt--nay much of Africa furnishes still more striking\nproofs of this exhaustion of nature.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" interrupted the old man, \"is it a certain truth that\nbuildings are still standing in that land of Pharaoh, which may be\nlikened, in their stature, to the hills of the 'arth?\"\n\n\"It is as true as that nature never refuses to bestow her incisores on\nthe animals, mammalia; genus, homo--\"\n\n\"It is very marvellous! and it proves how great He must be, when His\nmiserable creatur's can accomplish such wonders! Many men must have been\nneeded to finish such an edifice; ay, and men gifted with strength and\nskill too! Does the land abound with such a race to this hour?\"\n\n\"Far from it. Most of the country is a desert, and but for a mighty\nriver all would be so.\"\n\n\"Yes; rivers are rare gifts to such as till the ground, as any one may\nsee who journeys far atween the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi. But\nhow do you account for these changes on the face of the 'arth itself,\nand for this downfall of nations, you men of the schools?\"\n\n\"It is to be ascribed to moral cau--\"\n\n\"You're right--it is their morals; their wickedness and their pride,\nand chiefly their waste that has done it all! Now listen to what the\nexperience of an old man teaches him. I have lived long, as these grey\nhairs and wrinkled hands will show, even though my tongue should fail\nin the wisdom of my years. And I have seen much of the folly of man; for\nhis natur' is the same, be he born in the wilderness, or be he born in\nthe towns. To my weak judgment it hath ever seemed that his gifts are\nnot equal to his wishes. That he would mount into the heavens, with\nall his deformities about him, if he only knew the road, no one will\ngainsay, that witnesses his bitter strivings upon 'arth. If his power\nis not equal to his will, it is because the wisdom of the Lord hath set\nbounds to his evil workings.\"\n\n\"It is much too certain that certain facts will warrant a theory, which\nteaches the natural depravity of the genus; but if science could\nbe fairly brought to bear on a whole species at once, for instance,\neducation might eradicate the evil principle.\"\n\n\"That, for your education! The time has been when I have thought it\npossible to make a companion of a beast. Many are the cubs, and many are\nthe speckled fawns that I have reared with these old hands, until I have\neven fancied them rational and altered beings--but what did it amount\nto? the bear would bite, and the deer would run, notwithstanding my\nwicked conceit in fancying I could change a temper that the Lord himself\nhad seen fit to bestow. Now if man is so blinded in his folly as to\ngo on, ages on ages, doing harm chiefly to himself, there is the same\nreason to think that he has wrought his evil here as in the countries\nyou call so old. Look about you, man; where are the multitudes that once\npeopled these prairies; the kings and the palaces; the riches and the\nmightinesses of this desert?\"\n\n\"Where are the monuments that would prove the truth of so vague a\ntheory?\"\n\n\"I know not what you call a monument.\"\n\n\"The works of man! The glories of Thebes and Balbec--columns, catacombs,\nand pyramids! standing amid the sands of the East, like wrecks on a\nrocky shore, to testify to the storms of ages!\"\n\n\"They are gone. Time has lasted too long for them. For why? Time was\nmade by the Lord, and they were made by man. This very spot of reeds\nand grass, on which you now sit, may once have been the garden of some\nmighty king. It is the fate of all things to ripen, and then to decay.\nThe tree blossoms, and bears its fruit, which falls, rots, withers,\nand even the seed is lost! Go, count the rings of the oak and of the\nsycamore; they lie in circles, one about another, until the eye is\nblinded in striving to make out their numbers; and yet a full change of\nthe seasons comes round while the stem is winding one of these little\nlines about itself, like the buffaloe changing his coat, or the buck his\nhorns; and what does it all amount to? There does the noble tree fill\nits place in the forest, loftier, and grander, and richer, and more\ndifficult to imitate, than any of your pitiful pillars, for a thousand\nyears, until the time which the Lord hath given it is full. Then come\nthe winds, that you cannot see, to rive its bark; and the waters from\nthe heavens, to soften its pores; and the rot, which all can feel and\nnone can understand, to humble its pride and bring it to the ground.\nFrom that moment its beauty begins to perish. It lies another hundred\nyears, a mouldering log, and then a mound of moss and 'arth; a sad\neffigy of a human grave. This is one of your genuine monuments, though\nmade by a very different power than such as belongs to your chiseling\nmasonry! and after all, the cunningest scout of the whole Dahcotah\nnation might pass his life in searching for the spot where it fell, and\nbe no wiser when his eyes grew dim, than when they were first opened. As\nif that was not enough to convince man of his ignorance; and as though\nit were put there in mockery of his conceit, a pine shoots up from the\nroots of the oak, just as barrenness comes after fertility, or as these\nwastes have been spread, where a garden may have been created. Tell me\nnot of your worlds that are old! it is blasphemous to set bounds and\nseasons, in this manner, to the works of the Almighty, like a woman\ncounting the ages of her young.\"\n\n\"Friend hunter, or trapper,\" returned the naturalist, clearing his\nthroat in some intellectual confusion at the vigorous attack of his\ncompanion, \"your deductions, if admitted by the world, would sadly\ncircumscribe the efforts of reason, and much abridge the boundaries of\nknowledge.\"\n\n\"So much the better--so much the better; for I have always found that a\nconceited man never knows content. All things prove it. Why have we\nnot the wings of the pigeon, the eyes of the eagle, and the legs of\nthe moose, if it had been intended that man should be equal to all his\nwishes?\"\n\n\"There are certain physical defects, venerable trapper, in which I am\nalways ready to admit great and happy alterations might be suggested.\nFor example, in my own order of Phalangacru--\"\n\n\"Cruel enough would be the order, that should come from miserable\nhands like thine! A touch from such a finger would destroy the mocking\ndeformity of a monkey! Go, go; human folly is not needed to fill up the\ngreat design of God. There is no stature, no beauty, no proportions,\nnor any colours in which man himself can well be fashioned, that is not\nalready done to his hands.\"\n\n\"That is touching another great and much disputed question,\" exclaimed\nthe Doctor, who seized upon every distinct idea that the ardent and\nsomewhat dogmatic old man left exposed to his mental grasp, with the\nvain hope of inducing a logical discussion, in which he might bring his\nbattery of syllogisms to annihilate the unscientific defences of his\nantagonist.\n\nIt is, however, unnecessary to our narrative to relate the erratic\ndiscourse that ensued. The old man eluded the annihilating blows of his\nadversary, as the light armed soldier is wont to escape the efforts of\nthe more regular warrior, even while he annoys him most, and an hour\npassed away without bringing any of the numerous subjects, on which they\ntouched, to a satisfactory conclusion. The arguments acted, however, on\nthe nervous system of the Doctor, like so many soothing soporifics, and\nby the time his aged companion was disposed to lay his head on his pack,\nObed, refreshed by his recent mental joust, was in a condition to seek\nhis natural rest, without enduring the torments of the incubus, in the\nshapes of Teton warriors and bloody tomahawks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n                           --Save you, sir.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nThe sleep of the fugitives lasted for several hours. The trapper was the\nfirst to shake off its influence, as he had been the last to court its\nrefreshment. Rising, just as the grey light of day began to brighten\nthat portion of the studded vault which rested on the eastern margin of\nthe plain, he summoned his companions from their warm lairs, and pointed\nout the necessity of their being once more on the alert. While Middleton\nattended to the arrangements necessary to the comforts of Inez and\nEllen, in the long and painful journey which lay before them, the old\nman and Paul prepared the meal, which the former had advised them to\ntake before they proceeded to horse. These several dispositions were\nnot long in making, and the little group was soon seated about a\nrepast which, though it might want the elegancies to which the bride of\nMiddleton had been accustomed, was not deficient in the more important\nrequisites of savour and nutriment.\n\n\"When we get lower into the hunting-grounds of the Pawnees,\" said the\ntrapper, laying a morsel of delicate venison before Inez, on a little\ntrencher neatly made of horn, and expressly for his own use, \"we shall\nfind the buffaloes fatter and sweeter, the deer in more abundance, and\nall the gifts of the Lord abounding to satisfy our wants. Perhaps we may\neven strike a beaver, and get a morsel from his tail[*] by way of a rare\nmouthful.\"\n\n    [*] The American hunters consider the tail of the beaver the most\n    nourishing of all food.\n\n\"What course do you mean to pursue, when you have once thrown these\nbloodhounds from the chase?\" demanded Middleton.\n\n\"If I might advise,\" said Paul, \"it would be to strike a water-course,\nand get upon its downward current, as soon as may be. Give me a\ncotton-wood, and I will turn you out a canoe that shall carry us all,\nthe jackass excepted, in perhaps the work of a day and a night. Ellen,\nhere, is a lively girl enough, but then she is no great race-rider; and\nit would be far more comfortable to boat six or eight hundred miles,\nthan to go loping along like so many elks measuring the prairies;\nbesides, water leaves no trail.\"\n\n\"I will not swear to that,\" returned the trapper; \"I have often thought\nthe eyes of a Red-skin would find a trail in air.\"\n\n\"See, Middleton,\" exclaimed Inez, in a sudden burst of youthful\npleasure, that caused her for a moment to forget her situation, \"how\nlovely is that sky; surely it contains a promise of happier times!\"\n\n\"It is glorious!\" returned her husband. \"Glorious and heavenly is that\nstreak of vivid red, and here is a still brighter crimson; rarely have I\nseen a richer rising of the sun.\n\n\"Rising of the sun!\" slowly repeated the old man, lifting his tall\nperson from its seat with a deliberate and abstracted air, while he\nkept his eye riveted on the changing, and certainly beautiful tints,\nthat were garnishing the vault of Heaven. \"Rising of the sun! I like not\nsuch risings of the sun. Ah's me! the imps have circumvented us with a\nvengeance. The prairie is on fire!\"\n\n\"God in Heaven protect us!\" cried Middleton, catching Inez to his bosom,\nunder the instant impression of the imminence of their danger. \"There is\nno time to lose, old man; each instant is a day; let us fly.\"\n\n\"Whither?\" demanded the trapper, motioning him, with calmness and\ndignity, to arrest his steps. \"In this wilderness of grass and reeds,\nyou are like a vessel in the broad lakes without a compass. A single\nstep on the wrong course might prove the destruction of us all. It is\nseldom danger is so pressing, that there is not time enough for reason\nto do its work, young officer; therefore let us await its biddings.\"\n\n\"For my own part,\" said Paul Hover, looking about him with no equivocal\nexpression of concern, \"I acknowledge, that should this dry bed of weeds\nget fairly in a flame, a bee would have to make a flight higher than\ncommon to prevent his wings from scorching. Therefore, old trapper, I\nagree with the captain, and say mount and run.\"\n\n\"Ye are wrong--ye are wrong; man is not a beast to follow the gift of\ninstinct, and to snuff up his knowledge by a taint in the air, or a\nrumbling in the sound; but he must see and reason, and then conclude.\nSo follow me a little to the left, where there is a rise in the ground,\nwhence we may make our reconnoitrings.\"\n\nThe old man waved his hand with authority, and led the way without\nfurther parlance to the spot he had indicated, followed by the whole of\nhis alarmed companions. An eye less practised than that of the trapper\nmight have failed in discovering the gentle elevation to which he\nalluded, and which looked on the surface of the meadow like a growth\na little taller than common. When they reached the place, however, the\nstinted grass itself announced the absence of that moisture, which had\nfed the rank weeds of most of the plain, and furnished a clue to the\nevidence by which he had judged of the formation of the ground hidden\nbeneath. Here a few minutes were lost in breaking down the tops of\nthe surrounding herbage, which, notwithstanding the advantage of their\nposition, rose even above the heads of Middleton and Paul, and in\nobtaining a look-out that might command a view of the surrounding sea of\nfire.\n\nThe frightful prospect added nothing to the hopes of those who had so\nfearful a stake in the result. Although the day was beginning to dawn,\nthe vivid colours of the sky continued to deepen, as if the fierce\nelement were bent on an impious rivalry of the light of the sun. Bright\nflashes of flame shot up here and there, along the margin of the waste,\nlike the nimble coruscations of the North, but far more angry and\nthreatening in their colour and changes. The anxiety on the rigid\nfeatures of the trapper sensibly deepened, as he leisurely traced these\nevidences of a conflagration, which spread in a broad belt about their\nplace of refuge, until he had encircled the whole horizon.\n\nShaking his head, as he again turned his face to the point where the\ndanger seemed nighest and most rapidly approaching, the old man said--\n\n\"Now have we been cheating ourselves with the belief, that we had thrown\nthese Tetons from our trail, while here is proof enough that they not\nonly know where we lie, but that they intend to smoke us out, like so\nmany skulking beasts of prey. See; they have lighted the fire around the\nwhole bottom at the same moment, and we are as completely hemmed in by\nthe devils as an island by its waters.\"\n\n\"Let us mount and ride,\" cried Middleton; \"is life not worth a\nstruggle?\"\n\n\"Whither would ye go? Is a Teton horse a salamander that he can walk\namid fiery flames unhurt, or do you think the Lord will show his might\nin your behalf, as in the days of old, and carry you harmless through\nsuch a furnace as you may see glowing beneath yonder red sky? There are\nSiouxes, too, hemming the fire with their arrows and knives on every\nside of us, or I am no judge of their murderous deviltries.\"\n\n\"We will ride into the centre of the whole tribe,\" returned the youth\nfiercely, \"and put their manhood to the test.\"\n\n\"Ay, it's well in words, but what would it prove in deeds? Here is a\ndealer in bees, who can teach you wisdom in a matter like this.\"\n\n\"Now for that matter, old trapper,\" said Paul, stretching his athletic\nform like a mastiff conscious of his strength, \"I am on the side of the\ncaptain, and am clearly for a race against the fire, though it line me\ninto a Teton wigwam. Here is Ellen, who will--\"\n\n\"Of what use, of what use are your stout hearts, when the element of the\nLord is to be conquered as well as human men. Look about you, friends;\nthe wreath of smoke, that is rising from the bottoms, plainly says that\nthere is no outlet from this spot, without crossing a belt of fire. Look\nfor yourselves, my men; look for yourselves; if you can find a single\nopening, I will engage to follow.\"\n\nThe examination, which his companions so instantly and so intently\nmade, rather served to assure them of their desperate situation, than\nto appease their fears. Huge columns of smoke were rolling up from the\nplain, and thickening in gloomy masses around the horizon. The red glow,\nwhich gleamed upon their enormous folds, now lighting their volumes with\nthe glare of the conflagration, and now flashing to another point, as\nthe flame beneath glided ahead, leaving all behind enveloped in awful\ndarkness, and proclaiming louder than words the character of the\nimminent and approaching danger.\n\n\"This is terrible!\" exclaimed Middleton, folding the trembling Inez to\nhis heart. \"At such a time as this, and in such a manner!\"\n\n\"The gates of Heaven are open to all who truly believe,\" murmured the\npious devotee in his bosom.\n\n\"This resignation is maddening! But we are men, and will make a struggle\nfor our lives! how now, my brave and spirited friend, shall we yet mount\nand push across the flames, or shall we stand here, and see those we\nmost love perish in this frightful manner, without an effort?\"\n\n\"I am for a swarming time, and a flight before the hive is too hot to\nhold us,\" said the bee-hunter, to whom it will be at once seen that\nMiddleton addressed himself. \"Come, old trapper, you must acknowledge\nthis is but a slow way of getting out of danger. If we tarry here much\nlonger, it will be in the fashion that the bees lie around the straw\nafter the hive has been smoked for its honey. You may hear the fire\nbegin to roar already, and I know by experience, that when the flame\nonce gets fairly into the prairie grass, it is no sloth that can outrun\nit.\"\n\n\"Think you,\" returned the old man, pointing scornfully at the mazes of\nthe dry and matted grass which environed them, \"that mortal feet can\noutstrip the speed of fire, on such a path! If I only knew now on which\nside these miscreants lay!\"\n\n\"What say you, friend Doctor,\" cried the bewildered Paul, turning to\nthe naturalist with that sort of helplessness with which the strong are\noften apt to seek aid of the weak, when human power is baffled by the\nhand of a mightier being, \"what say you; have you no advice to give\naway, in a case of life and death?\"\n\nThe naturalist stood, tablets in hand, looking at the awful spectacle\nwith as much composure as if the conflagration had been lighted in order\nto solve the difficulties of some scientific problem. Aroused by\nthe question of his companion, he turned to his equally calm though\ndifferently occupied associate, the trapper, demanding, with the most\nprovoking insensibility to the urgent nature of their situation--\n\n\"Venerable hunter, you have often witnessed similar prismatic\nexperiments--\"\n\nHe was rudely interrupted by Paul, who struck the tablets from his\nhands, with a violence that betrayed the utter intellectual confusion\nwhich had overset the equanimity of his mind. Before time was allowed\nfor remonstrance, the old man, who had continued during the whole scene\nlike one much at a loss how to proceed, though also like one who was\nrather perplexed than alarmed, suddenly assumed a decided air, as if he\nno longer doubted on the course it was most advisable to pursue.\n\n\"It is time to be doing,\" he said, interrupting the controversy that was\nabout to ensue between the naturalist and the bee-hunter; \"it is time to\nleave off books and moanings, and to be doing.\"\n\n\"You have come to your recollections too late, miserable old man,\" cried\nMiddleton; \"the flames are within a quarter of a mile of us, and the\nwind is bringing them down in this quarter with dreadful rapidity.\"\n\n\"Anan! the flames! I care but little for the flames. If I only knew how\nto circumvent the cunning of the Tetons, as I know how to cheat the fire\nof its prey, there would be nothing needed but thanks to the Lord for\nour deliverance. Do you call this a fire? If you had seen what I have\nwitnessed in the Eastern hills, when mighty mountains were like the\nfurnace of smith, you would have known what it was to fear the flames,\nand to be thankful that you were spared! Come, lads, come; 'tis time to\nbe doing now, and to cease talking; for yonder curling flame is truly\ncoming on like a trotting moose. Put hands upon this short and withered\ngrass where we stand, and lay bare the 'arth.\"\n\n\"Would you think to deprive the fire of its victims in this childish\nmanner?\" exclaimed Middleton.\n\nA faint but solemn smile passed over the features of the old man, as he\nanswered--\n\n\"Your grand'ther would have said, that when the enemy was nigh, a\nsoldier could do no better than to obey.\"\n\nThe captain felt the reproof, and instantly began to imitate the\nindustry of Paul, who was tearing the decayed herbage from the ground in\na sort of desperate compliance with the trapper's direction. Even Ellen\nlent her hands to the labour, nor was it long before Inez was seen\nsimilarly employed, though none amongst them knew why or wherefore.\nWhen life is thought to be the reward of labour, men are wont to be\nindustrious. A very few moments sufficed to lay bare a spot of some\ntwenty feet in diameter. Into one edge of this little area the trapper\nbrought the females, directing Middleton and Paul to cover their light\nand inflammable dresses with the blankets of the party. So soon as this\nprecaution was observed, the old man approached the opposite margin of\nthe grass, which still environed them in a tall and dangerous circle,\nand selecting a handful of the driest of the herbage he placed it over\nthe pan of his rifle. The light combustible kindled at the flash. Then\nhe placed the little flame in a bed of the standing fog, and withdrawing\nfrom the spot to the centre of the ring, he patiently awaited the\nresult.\n\nThe subtle element seized with avidity upon its new fuel, and in a\nmoment forked flames were gliding among the grass, as the tongues of\nruminating animals are seen rolling among their food, apparently in\nquest of its sweetest portions.\n\n\"Now,\" said the old man, holding up a finger, and laughing in his\npeculiarly silent manner, \"you shall see fire fight fire! Ah's me! many\nis the time I have burnt a smooty path, from wanton laziness to pick my\nway across a tangled bottom.\"\n\n\"But is this not fatal?\" cried the amazed Middleton; \"are you not\nbringing the enemy nigher to us instead of avoiding it?\"\n\n\"Do you scorch so easily? your grand'ther had a tougher skin. But we\nshall live to see; we shall all live to see.\"\n\nThe experience of the trapper was in the right. As the fire gained\nstrength and heat, it began to spread on three sides, dying of itself on\nthe fourth, for want of aliment. As it increased, and the sullen roaring\nannounced its power, it cleared every thing before it, leaving the black\nand smoking soil far more naked than if the scythe had swept the place.\nThe situation of the fugitives would have still been hazardous had not\nthe area enlarged as the flame encircled them. But by advancing to the\nspot where the trapper had kindled the grass, they avoided the heat,\nand in a very few moments the flames began to recede in every quarter,\nleaving them enveloped in a cloud of smoke, but perfectly safe from the\ntorrent of fire that was still furiously rolling onward.\n\nThe spectators regarded the simple expedient of the trapper with that\nspecies of wonder, with which the courtiers of Ferdinand are said to\nhave viewed the manner in which Columbus made his egg stand on its end,\nthough with feelings that were filled with gratitude instead of envy.\n\n\"Most wonderful!\" said Middleton, when he saw the complete success\nof the means by which they had been rescued from a danger that he had\nconceived to be unavoidable. \"The thought was a gift from Heaven, and\nthe hand that executed it should be immortal!\"\n\n\"Old trapper,\" cried Paul, thrusting his fingers through his shaggy\nlocks, \"I have lined many a loaded bee into his hole, and know something\nof the nature of the woods, but this is robbing a hornet of his sting\nwithout touching the insect!\"\n\n\"It will do--it will do,\" returned the old man, who after the first\nmoment of his success seemed to think no more of the exploit; \"now get\nthe horses in readiness. Let the flames do their work for a short half\nhour, and then we will mount. That time is needed to cool the meadow,\nfor these unshod Teton beasts are as tender on the hoof as a barefooted\ngirl.\"\n\nMiddleton and Paul, who considered this unlooked-for escape as a species\nof resurrection, patiently awaited the time the trapper mentioned with\nrenewed confidence in the infallibility of his judgment. The Doctor\nregained his tablets, a little the worse from having fallen among\nthe grass which had been subject to the action of the flames, and\nwas consoling himself for this slight misfortune by recording\nuninterruptedly such different vacillations in light and shadow as he\nchose to consider phenomena.\n\nIn the mean time the veteran, on whose experience they all so implicitly\nrelied for protection, employed himself in reconnoitring objects in the\ndistance, through the openings which the air occasionally made in the\nimmense bodies of smoke, that by this time lay in enormous piles on\nevery part of the plain.\n\n\"Look you here, lads,\" the trapper said, after a long and anxious\nexamination, \"your eyes are young and may prove better than my worthless\nsight--though the time has been, when a wise and brave people saw reason\nto think me quick on a look-out; but those times are gone, and many a\ntrue and tried friend has passed away with them. Ah's me! if I could\nchoose a change in the orderings of Providence--which I cannot, and\nwhich it would be blasphemy to attempt, seeing that all things are\ngoverned by a wiser mind than belongs to mortal weakness--but if I were\nto choose a change, it would be to say, that such as they who have lived\nlong together in friendship and kindness, and who have proved their\nfitness to go in company, by many acts of suffering and daring in each\nother's behalf, should be permitted to give up life at such times, as\nwhen the death of one leaves the other but little reason to wish to\nlive.\"\n\n\"Is it an Indian, that you see?\" demanded the impatient Middleton.\n\n\"Red-skin or White-skin it is much the same. Friendship and use can tie\nmen as strongly together in the woods as in the towns--ay, and for that\nmatter, stronger. Here are the young warriors of the prairies.--Often\ndo they sort themselves in pairs, and set apart their lives for deeds\nof friendship; and well and truly do they act up to their promises.\nThe death-blow to one is commonly mortal to the other! I have been a\nsolitary man much of my time, if he can be called solitary, who has\nlived for seventy years in the very bosom of natur', and where he could\nat any instant open his heart to God, without having to strip it of the\ncares and wickednesses of the settlements--but making that allowance,\nhave I been a solitary man; and yet have I always found that intercourse\nwith my kind was pleasant, and painful to break off, provided that the\ncompanion was brave and honest. Brave, because a skeary comrade in the\nwoods,\" suffering his eyes inadvertently to rest a moment on the person\nof the abstracted naturalist, \"is apt to make a short path long; and\nhonest, inasmuch as craftiness is rather an instinct of the brutes, than\na gift becoming the reason of a human man.\"\n\n\"But the object, that you saw--was it a Sioux?\"\n\n\"What the world of America is coming to, and where the machinations and\ninventions of its people are to have an end, the Lord, he only knows. I\nhave seen, in my day, the chief who, in his time, had beheld the first\nChristian that placed his wicked foot in the regions of York! How much\nhas the beauty of the wilderness been deformed in two short lives! My\nown eyes were first opened on the shores of the Eastern sea, and well\ndo I remember, that I tried the virtues of the first rifle I ever bore,\nafter such a march, from the door of my father to the forest, as a\nstripling could make between sun and sun; and that without offence to\nthe rights, or prejudices, of any man who set himself up to be the owner\nof the beasts of the fields. Natur' then lay in its glory along the\nwhole coast, giving a narrow stripe, between the woods and the ocean, to\nthe greediness of the settlers. And where am I now? Had I the wings\nof an eagle, they would tire before a tenth of the distance, which\nseparates me from that sea, could be passed; and towns, and villages,\nfarms, and highways, churches, and schools, in short, all the inventions\nand deviltries of man, are spread across the region. I have known the\ntime when a few Red-skins, shouting along the borders, could set the\nprovinces in a fever; and men were to be armed; and troops were to be\ncalled to aid from a distant land; and prayers were said, and the women\nfrighted, and few slept in quiet, because the Iroquois were on the\nwar-path, or the accursed Mingo had the tomahawk in hand. How is it now?\nThe country sends out her ships to foreign lands, to wage their battles;\ncannon are plentier than the rifle used to be, and trained soldiers are\nnever wanting, in tens of thousands, when need calls for their services.\nSuch is the difference atween a province and a state, my men; and I,\nmiserable and worn out as I seem, have lived to see it all!\"\n\n\"That you must have seen many a chopper skimming the cream from the face\nof the earth, and many a settler getting the very honey of nature, old\ntrapper,\" said Paul, \"no reasonable man can, or, for that matter, shall\ndoubt. But here is Ellen getting uneasy about the Siouxes, and now you\nhave opened your mind, so freely, concerning these matters, if you\nwill just put us on the line of our flight, the swarm will make another\nmove.\"\n\n\"Anan!\"\n\n\"I say that Ellen is getting uneasy, and as the smoke is lifting from\nthe plain, it may be prudent to take another flight.\"\n\n\"The boy is reasonable. I had forgotten we were in the midst of a raging\nfire, and that Siouxes were round about us, like hungry wolves watching\na drove of buffaloes. But when memory is at work in my old brain, on\ntimes long past, it is apt to overlook the matters of the day. You say\nright, my children; it is time to be moving, and now comes the real\nnicety of our case. It is easy to outwit a furnace, for it is nothing\nbut a raging element; and it is not always difficult to throw a grizzly\nbear from his scent, for the creatur' is both enlightened and blinded\nby his instinct; but to shut the eyes of a waking Teton is a matter of\ngreater judgment, inasmuch as his deviltry is backed by reason.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the old man appeared so conscious of the difficulty of\nthe undertaking, he set about its achievement with great steadiness and\nalacrity. After completing the examination, which had been interrupted\nby the melancholy wanderings of his mind, he gave the signal to his\ncompanions to mount. The horses, which had continued passive and\ntrembling amid the raging of the fire, received their burdens with a\nsatisfaction so very evident, as to furnish a favourable augury of their\nfuture industry. The trapper invited the Doctor to take his own steed,\ndeclaring his intention to proceed on foot.\n\n\"I am but little used to journeying with the feet of others,\" he added,\nas a reason for the measure, \"and my legs are a weary of doing nothing.\nBesides, should we light suddenly on an ambushment, which is a thing far\nfrom impossible, the horse will be in a better condition for a hard\nrun with one man on his back than with two. As for me, what matters it\nwhether my time is to be a day shorter or a day longer! Let the Tetons\ntake my scalp, if it be God's pleasure: they will find it covered\nwith grey hairs; and it is beyond the craft of man to cheat me of the\nknowledge and experience by which they have been whitened.\"\n\nAs no one among the impatient listeners seemed disposed to dispute\nthe arrangement, it was acceded to in silence. The Doctor, though he\nmuttered a few mourning exclamations on behalf of the lost Asinus,\nwas by far too well pleased in finding that his speed was likely to be\nsustained by four legs instead of two, to be long in complying: and,\nconsequently, in a very few moments the bee-hunter, who was never last\nto speak on such occasions, vociferously announced that they were ready\nto proceed.\n\n\"Now look off yonder to the East,\" said the old man, as he began to lead\nthe way across the murky and still smoking plain; \"little fear of cold\nfeet in journeying such a path as this: but look you off to the East,\nand if you see a sheet of shining white, glistening like a plate of\nbeaten silver through the openings of the smoke, why that is water. A\nnoble stream is running thereaway, and I thought I got a glimpse of it\na while since; but other thoughts came, and I lost it. It is a broad\nand swift river, such as the Lord has made many of its fellows in this\ndesert. For here may natur' be seen in all its richness, trees alone\nexcepted. Trees, which are to the 'arth, as fruits are to a garden;\nwithout them nothing can be pleasant, or thoroughly useful. Now watch\nall of you, with open eyes, for that stripe of glittering water: we\nshall not be safe until it is flowing between our trail and these sharp\nsighted Tetons.\"\n\nThe latter declaration was enough to ensure a vigilant look out for the\ndesired stream, on the part of all the trapper's followers. With this\nobject in view, the party proceeded in profound silence, the old man\nhaving admonished them of the necessity of caution, as they entered the\nclouds of smoke, which were rolling like masses of fog along the plain,\nmore particularly over those spots where the fire had encountered\noccasional pools of stagnant water.\n\nThey travelled near a league in this manner, without obtaining the\ndesired glimpse of the river. The fire was still raging in the distance,\nand as the air swept away the first vapour of the conflagration, fresh\nvolumes rolled along the place, limiting the view. At length the old\nman, who had begun to betray some little uneasiness, which caused his\nfollowers to apprehend that even his acute faculties were beginning\nto be confused, in the mazes of the smoke, made a sudden pause, and\ndropping his rifle to the ground, he stood, apparently musing over some\nobject at his feet. Middleton and the rest rode up to his side, and\ndemanded the reason of the halt.\n\n\"Look ye, here,\" returned the trapper, pointing to the mutilated carcass\nof a horse, that lay more than half consumed in a little hollow of the\nground; \"here may you see the power of a prairie conflagration. The\n'arth is moist, hereaway, and the grass has been taller than usual.\nThis miserable beast has been caught in his bed. You see the bones; the\ncrackling and scorched hide, and the grinning teeth. A thousand winters\ncould not wither an animal so thoroughly, as the element has done it in\na minute.\"\n\n\"And this might have been our fate,\" said Middleton, \"had the flames\ncome upon us, in our sleep!\"\n\n\"Nay, I do not say that, I do not say that. Not but that man will burn\nas well as tinder; but, that being more reasoning than a horse, he would\nbetter know how to avoid the danger.\"\n\n\"Perhaps this then has been but the carcass of an animal, or he too\nwould have fled?\"\n\n\"See you these marks in the damp soil? Here have been his hoofs,--and\nthere is a moccasin print, as I'm a sinner! The owner of the beast has\ntried hard to move him from the place, but it is in the instinct of the\ncreatur' to be faint-hearted and obstinate in a fire.\"\n\n\"It is a well-known fact. But if the animal has had a rider, where is\nhe?\"\n\n\"Ay, therein lies the mystery,\" returned the trapper, stooping to\nexamine the signs in the ground with a closer eye. \"Yes, yes, it is\nplain there has been a long struggle atween the two. The master has\ntried hard to save his beast, and the flames must have been very greedy,\nor he would have had better success.\"\n\n\"Harkee, old trapper,\" interrupted Paul, pointing to a little distance,\nwhere the ground was drier, and the herbage had, in consequence, been\nless luxuriant; \"just call them two horses. Yonder lies another.\"\n\n\"The boy is right! can it be, that the Tetons have been caught in\ntheir own snares? Such things do happen; and here is an example to all\nevil-doers. Ay, look you here, this is iron; there have been some white\ninventions about the trappings of the beast--it must be so--it must\nbe so--a party of the knaves have been skirting in the grass after\nus, while their friends have fired the prairie, and look you at the\nconsequences; they have lost their beasts, and happy have they been if\ntheir own souls are not now skirting along the path, which leads to the\nIndian heaven.\"\n\n\"They had the same expedient at command as yourself,\" rejoined\nMiddleton, as the party slowly proceeded, approaching the other carcass,\nwhich lay directly on their route.\n\n\"I know not that. It is not every savage that carries his steel and\nflint, or as good a rifle-pan as this old friend of mine. It is slow\nmaking a fire with two sticks, and little time was given to consider, or\ninvent, just at this spot, as you may see by yon streak of flame, which\nis flashing along afore the wind, as if it were on a trail of powder. It\nis not many minutes since the fire has passed here away, and it may\nbe well to look at our primings, not that I would willingly combat the\nTetons, God forbid! but if a fight needs be, it is always wise to get\nthe first shot.\"\n\n\"This has been a strange beast, old man,\" said Paul, who had pulled the\nbridle, or rather halter of his steed, over the second carcass, while\nthe rest of the party were already passing, in their eagerness to\nproceed; \"a strange horse do I call it; it had neither head nor hoofs!\"\n\n\"The fire has not been idle,\" returned the trapper, keeping his eye\nvigilantly employed in profiting by those glimpses of the horizon, which\nthe whirling smoke offered to his examination. \"It would soon bake you a\nbuffaloe whole, or for that matter powder his hoofs and horns into white\nashes. Shame, shame, old Hector: as for the captain's pup, it is to be\nexpected that he would show his want of years, and I may say, I hope\nwithout offence, his want of education too; but for a hound, like you,\nwho have lived so long in the forest afore you came into these plains,\nit is very disgraceful, Hector, to be showing your teeth, and growling\nat the carcass of a roasted horse, the same as if you were telling your\nmaster that you had found the trail of a grizzly bear.\"\n\n\"I tell you, old trapper, this is no horse; neither in hoofs, head, nor\nhide.\"\n\n\"Anan! Not a horse? Your eyes are good for the bees and for the hollow\ntrees, my lad, but--bless me, the boy is right! That I should mistake\nthe hide of a buffaloe, scorched and crimpled as it is, for the carcass\nof a horse! Ah's me! The time has been, my men, when I would tell you\nthe name of a beast, as far as eye could reach, and that too with most\nof the particulars of colour, age, and sex.\"\n\n\"An inestimable advantage have you then enjoyed, venerable venator!\"\nobserved the attentive naturalist. \"The man who can make these\ndistinctions in a desert, is saved the pain of many a weary walk, and\noften of an enquiry that in its result proves useless. Pray tell me, did\nyour exceeding excellence of vision extend so far as to enable you to\ndecide on their order, or genus?\"\n\n\"I know not what you mean by your orders of genius.\"\n\n\"No!\" interrupted the bee-hunter, a little disdainfully for him, when\nspeaking to his aged friend; \"now, old trapper, that is admitting your\nignorance of the English language, in a way I should not expect from a\nman of your experience and understanding. By order, our comrade means\nwhether they go in promiscuous droves, like a swarm that is following\nits queen-bee, or in single file, as you often see the buffaloes\ntrailing each other through a prairie. And as for genius, I'm sure\nthat is a word well understood, and in every body's mouth. There is the\ncongress-man in our district, and that tonguey little fellow, who\nputs out the paper in our county, they are both so called, for their\nsmartness; which is what the Doctor means, as I take it, seeing that he\nseldom speaks without some considerable meaning.\"\n\nWhen Paul finished this very clever explanation he looked behind him\nwith an expression, which, rightly interpreted, would have said--\"You\nsee, though I don't often trouble myself in these matters, I am no\nfool.\"\n\nEllen admired Paul for anything but his learning. There was enough in\nhis frank, fearless, and manly character, backed as it was by great\npersonal attraction, to awaken her sympathies, without the necessity of\nprying into his mental attainments. The poor girl reddened like a rose,\nher pretty fingers played with the belt, by which she sustained herself\non the horse, and she hurriedly observed, as if anxious to direct the\nattentions of the other listeners from a weakness, on which her own\nthoughts could not bear to dwell--\n\n\"And this is not a horse, after all?\"\n\n\"It is nothing more, nor less, than the hide of a buffaloe,\" continued\nthe trapper, who had been no less puzzled by the explanation of Paul,\nthan by the language of the Doctor; \"the hair is beneath; the fire has\nrun over it as you see; for being fresh, the flames could take no hold.\nThe beast has not been long killed, and it may be that some of the beef\nis still hereaway.\"\n\n\"Lift the corner of the skin, old trapper,\" said Paul, with the tone of\none, who felt, as if he had now proved his right to mingle his voice\nin any council; \"if there is a morsel of the hump left, it must be well\ncooked, and it shall be welcome.\"\n\nThe old man laughed, heartily, at the conceit of his companion.\nThrusting his foot beneath the skin, it moved. Then it was suddenly cast\naside, and an Indian warrior sprang from its cover, to his feet, with an\nagility, that bespoke how urgent he deemed the occasion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n             I would it were bed-time, Hal, and all well.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nA second glance sufficed to convince the whole of the startled party,\nthat the young Pawnee, whom they had already encountered, again stood\nbefore them. Surprise kept both sides mute, and more than a minute was\npassed in surveying each other, with eyes of astonishment, if not\nof distrust. The wonder of the young warrior was, however, much more\ntempered and dignified than that of his Christian acquaintances. While\nMiddleton and Paul felt the tremor, which shook the persons of their\ndependant companions, thrilling through their own quickened blood, the\nglowing eye of the Indian rolled from one to another, as if it could\nnever quail before the rudest assaults. His gaze, after making the\ncircuit of every wondering countenance, finally settled in a steady look\non the equally immovable features of the trapper. The silence was first\nbroken by Dr. Battius, in the ejaculation of--\"Order, primates; genus,\nhomo; species, prairie!\"\n\n\"Ay--ay--the secret is out,\" said the old trapper, shaking his head,\nlike one who congratulated himself on having mastered the mystery of\nsome knotty difficulty. \"The lad has been in the grass for a cover; the\nfire has come upon him in his sleep, and having lost his horse, he has\nbeen driven to save himself under that fresh hide of a buffaloe. No\nbad invention, when powder and flint were wanting to kindle a ring. I\nwarrant me, now, this is a clever youth, and one that it would be safe\nto journey with! I will speak to him kindly, for anger can at least\nserve no turn of ours. My brother is welcome again,\" using the language,\nwhich the other understood; \"the Tetons have been smoking him, as they\nwould a racoon.\"\n\nThe young Pawnee rolled his eye over the place, as if he were examining\nthe terrific danger from which he had just escaped, but he disdained to\nbetray the smallest emotion, at its imminency. His brow contracted, as\nhe answered to the remark of the trapper by saying--\n\n\"A Teton is a dog. When the Pawnee war-whoop is in their ears, the whole\nnation howls.\"\n\n\"It is true. The imps are on our trail, and I am glad to meet a warrior,\nwith the tomahawk in his hand, who does not love them. Will my brother\nlead my children to his village? If the Siouxes follow on our path, my\nyoung men shall help him to strike them.\"\n\nThe young Pawnee turned his eyes from one to another of the strangers,\nin a keen scrutiny, before he saw fit to answer so important an\ninterrogatory. His examination of the males was short, and apparently\nsatisfactory. But his gaze was fastened long and admiringly, as in their\nformer interview, on the surpassing and unwonted beauty of a being so\nfair and so unknown as Inez. Though his glance wandered, for moments,\nfrom her countenance to the more intelligible and yet extraordinary\ncharms of Ellen, it did not fail to return promptly to the study of\na creature who, in the view of his unpractised eye and untutored\nimagination, was formed with all that perfection, with which the\nyouthful poet is apt to endow the glowing images of his brain. Nothing\nso fair, so ideal, so every way worthy to reward the courage and\nself-devotion of a warrior, had ever before been encountered on the\nprairies, and the young brave appeared to be deeply and intuitively\nsensible to the influence of so rare a model of the loveliness of the\nsex. Perceiving, however, that his gaze gave uneasiness to the\nsubject of his admiration, he withdrew his eyes, and laying his hand\nimpressively on his chest, he, modestly, answered--\n\n\"My father shall be welcome. The young men of my nation shall hunt with\nhis sons; the chiefs shall smoke with the grey-head. The Pawnee girls\nwill sing in the ears of his daughters.\"\n\n\"And if we meet the Tetons?\" demanded the trapper, who wished to\nunderstand, thoroughly, the more important conditions of this new\nalliance.\n\n\"The enemy of the Big-knives shall feel the blow of the Pawnee.\"\n\n\"It is well. Now let my brother and I meet in council, that we may not\ngo on a crooked path, but that our road to his village may be like the\nflight of the pigeons.\"\n\nThe young Pawnee made a significant gesture of assent and followed\nthe other a little apart, in order to be removed from all danger of\ninterruption from the reckless Paul, or the abstracted naturalist. Their\nconference was short, but, as it was conducted in the sententious manner\nof the natives, it served to make each of the parties acquainted with\nall the necessary information of the other. When they rejoined their\nassociates, the old man saw fit to explain a portion of what had passed\nbetween them, as follows--\n\n\"Ay, I was not mistaken,\" he said; \"this good-looking young warrior--for\ngood-looking and noble-looking he is, though a little horrified perhaps\nwith paint--this good-looking youth, then, tells me he is out on the\nscout for these very Tetons. His party was not strong enough to strike\nthe devils, who are down from their towns in great numbers to hunt the\nbuffaloe, and runners have gone to the Pawnee villages for aid. It would\nseem that this lad is a fearless boy, for he has been hanging on their\nskirts alone, until, like ourselves, he was driven to the grass for a\ncover. But he tells me more, my men, and what I am mainly sorry to hear,\nwhich is, that the cunning Mahtoree instead of going to blows with the\nsquatter, has become his friend, and that both broods, red and white,\nare on our heels, and outlying around this very burning plain to\ncircumvent us to our destruction.\"\n\n\"How knows he all this to be true?\" demanded Middleton.\n\n\"Anan?\"\n\n\"In what manner does he know, that these things are so?\"\n\n\"In what manner! Do you think newspapers and town criers are needed to\ntell a scout what is doing on the prairies, as they are in the bosom\nof the States? No gossiping woman, who hurries from house to house to\nspread evil of her neighbour, can carry tidings with her tongue, so fast\nas these people will spread their meaning, by signs and warnings, that\nthey alone understand. 'Tis their l'arning, and what is better, it is\ngot in the open air, and not within the walls of a school. I tell you,\ncaptain, that what he says is true.\"\n\n\"For that matter,\" said Paul, \"I'm ready to swear to it. It is\nreasonable, and therefore it must be true.\"\n\n\"And well you might, lad; well you might. He furthermore declares, that\nmy old eyes for once were true to me, and that the river lies, hereaway,\nat about the distance of half a league. You see the fire has done most\nof its work in that quarter, and our path is clouded in smoke. He also\nagrees that it is needful to wash our trail in water. Yes, we must put\nthat river atween us and the Sioux eyes, and then, by the favour of the\nLord, not forgetting our own industry, we may gain the village of the\nLoups.\"\n\n\"Words will not forward us a foot,\" said Middleton; \"let us move.\"\n\nThe old man assented, and the party once more prepared to renew its\nroute. The Pawnee threw the skin of the buffaloe over his shoulder\nand led the advance, casting many a stolen glance behind him as he\nproceeded, in order to fix his gaze on the extraordinary and, to him,\nunaccountable loveliness of the unconscious Inez.\n\nAn hour sufficed to bring the fugitives to the bank of the stream, which\nwas one of the hundred rivers that serve to conduct, through the mighty\narteries of the Missouri and Mississippi, the waters of that vast and\nstill uninhabited region to the Ocean. The river was not deep, but its\ncurrent was troubled and rapid. The flames had scorched the earth to its\nvery margin, and as the warm streams of the fluid mingled, in the cooler\nair of the morning, with the smoke of the raging conflagration, most\nof its surface was wrapped in a mantle of moving vapour. The trapper\npointed out the circumstance with pleasure, saying, as he assisted Inez\nto dismount on the margin of the watercourse--\n\n\"The knaves have outwitted themselves! I am far from certain that I\nshould not have fired the prairie, to have got the benefit of this very\nsmoke to hide our movements, had not the heartless imps saved us the\ntrouble. I've known such things done in my day, and done with success.\nCome, lady, put your tender foot upon the ground--for a fearful time has\nit been to one of your breeding and skeary qualities. Ah's me! what\nhave I not known the young, and the delicate, and the virtuous, and\nthe modest, to undergo, in my time, among the horrifications and\ncircumventions of Indian warfare! Come, it is a short quarter of a mile\nto the other bank, and then our trail, at least, will be broken.\"\n\nPaul had by this time assisted Ellen to dismount, and he now stood\nlooking, with rueful eyes, at the naked banks of the river. Neither tree\nnor shrub grew along its borders, with the exception of here and there a\nsolitary thicket of low bushes, from among which it would not have been\nan easy matter to have found a dozen stems of a size sufficient to make\nan ordinary walking-stick.\n\n\"Harkee, old trapper,\" the moody-looking bee-hunter exclaimed; \"it is\nvery well to talk of the other side of this ripple of a river, or brook,\nor whatever you may call it, but in my judgment it would be a smart\nrifle that would throw its lead across it--that is, to any detriment to\nIndian, or deer.\"\n\n\"That it would--that it would; though I carry a piece, here, that has\ndone its work in time of need, at as great a distance.\"\n\n\"And do you mean to shoot Ellen and the captain's lady across; or do you\nintend them to go, trout fashion, with their mouths under water?\"\n\n\"Is this river too deep to be forded?\" asked Middleton, who, like Paul,\nbegan to consider the impossibility of transporting her, whose safety he\nvalued more than his own, to the opposite shore.\n\n\"When the mountains above feed it with their torrents, it is, as you\nsee, a swift and powerful stream. Yet have I crossed its sandy bed, in\nmy time, without wetting a knee. But we have the Sioux horses; I warrant\nme, that the kicking imps will swim like so many deer.\"\n\n\"Old trapper,\" said Paul, thrusting his fingers into his mop of a head,\nas was usual with him, when any difficulty confounded his philosophy,\n\"I have swam like a fish in my day, and I can do it again, when there is\nneed; nor do I much regard the weather; but I question if you get Nelly\nto sit a horse, with this water whirling like a mill-race before her\neyes; besides, it is manifest the thing is not to be done dry shod.\"\n\n\"Ah, the lad is right. We must to our inventions, therefore, or the\nriver cannot be crossed.\" Then, cutting the discourse short, he turned\nto the Pawnee, and explained to him the difficulty which existed in\nrelation to the women. The young warrior listened gravely, and throwing\nthe buffaloe-skin from his shoulder he immediately commenced, assisted\nby the occasional aid of the understanding old man, the preparations\nnecessary to effect this desirable object.\n\nThe hide was soon drawn into the shape of an umbrella top, or an\ninverted parachute, by thongs of deer-skin, with which both the\nlabourers were well provided. A few light sticks served to keep the\nparts from collapsing, or falling in. When this simple and natural\nexpedient was arranged, it was placed on the water, the Indian making\na sign that it was ready to receive its freight. Both Inez and Ellen\nhesitated to trust themselves in a bark of so frail a construction, nor\nwould Middleton or Paul consent that they should do so, until each had\nassured himself, by actual experiment, that the vessel was capable of\nsustaining a load much heavier than it was destined to receive. Then,\nindeed, their scruples were reluctantly overcome, and the skin was made\nto receive its precious burden.\n\n\"Now leave the Pawnee to be the pilot,\" said the trapper; \"my hand is\nnot so steady as it used to be; but he has limbs like toughened hickory.\nLeave all to the wisdom of the Pawnee.\"\n\nThe husband and lover could not well do otherwise, and they were fain\nto become deeply interested, it is true, but passive spectators of\nthis primitive species of ferrying. The Pawnee selected the beast of\nMahtoree, from among the three horses, with a readiness that proved he\nwas far from being ignorant of the properties of that noble animal, and\nthrowing himself upon its back, he rode into the margin of the river.\nThrusting an end of his lance into the hide, he bore the light vessel\nup against the stream, and giving his steed the rein, they pushed boldly\ninto the current. Middleton and Paul followed, pressing as nigh the bark\nas prudence would at all warrant. In this manner the young warrior bore\nhis precious cargo to the opposite bank in perfect safety, without the\nslightest inconvenience to the passengers, and with a steadiness and\ncelerity which proved that both horse and rider were not unused to the\noperation. When the shore was gained, the young Indian undid his work,\nthrew the skin over his shoulder, placed the sticks under his arm, and\nreturned, without speaking, to transfer the remainder of the party, in a\nsimilar manner, to what was very justly considered the safer side of the\nriver.\n\n\"Now, friend Doctor,\" said the old man, when he saw the Indian plunging\ninto the river a second time, \"do I know there is faith in yonder\nRed-skin. He is a good-looking, ay, and an honest-looking youth, but\nthe winds of Heaven are not more deceitful than these savages, when the\ndevil has fairly beset them. Had the Pawnee been a Teton, or one of them\nheartless Mingoes, that used to be prowling through the woods of York, a\ntime back, that is, some sixty years agone, we should have seen his back\nand not his face turned towards us. My heart had its misgivings when I\nsaw the lad choose the better horse, for it would be as easy to leave us\nwith that beast, as it would for a nimble pigeon to part company from a\nflock of noisy and heavy winged crows. But you see that truth is in the\nboy, and make a Red-skin once your friend, he is yours so long as you\ndeal honestly by him.\"\n\n\"What may be the distance to the sources of this stream?\" demanded\nDoctor Battius, whose eyes were rolling over the whirling eddies of the\ncurrent, with a very portentous expression of doubt. \"At what distance\nmay its secret springs be found?\"\n\n\"That may be as the weather proves. I warrant me your legs would be\na-weary before you had followed its bed into the Rocky Mountains; but\nthen there are seasons when it might be done without wetting a foot.\"\n\n\"And in what particular divisions of the year do these periodical\nseasons occur?\"\n\n\"He that passes this spot a few months from this time, will find that\nfoaming water-course a desert of drifting sand.\"\n\nThe naturalist pondered deeply. Like most others, who are not endowed\nwith a superfluity of physical fortitude, the worthy man had found the\ndanger of passing the river, in so simple a manner, magnifying itself\nin his eyes so rapidly, as the moment of adventure approached, that he\nactually contemplated the desperate effort of going round the river, in\norder to escape the hazard of crossing it. It may not be necessary to\ndwell on the incredible ingenuity, with which terror will at any time\nprop a tottering argument. The worthy Obed had gone over the whole\nsubject, with commendable diligence, and had just arrived at the\nconsoling conclusion, that there was nearly as much glory in discerning\nthe hidden sources of so considerable a stream, as in adding a plant,\nor an insect, to the lists of the learned, when the Pawnee reached the\nshore for the second time. The old man took his seat, with the utmost\ndeliberation, in the vessel of skin (so soon as it had been duly\narranged for his reception), and having carefully disposed of Hector\nbetween his legs, he beckoned to his companion to occupy the third\nplace.\n\nThe naturalist placed a foot in the frail vessel, as an elephant will\ntry a bridge, or a horse is often seen to make a similar experiment,\nbefore he will trust the whole of his corporeal treasure on the dreaded\nflat, and then withdrew, just as the old man believed he was about to\nseat himself.\n\n\"Venerable venator,\" he said, mournfully, \"this is a most unscientific\nbark. There is an inward monitor which bids me distrust its security!\"\n\n\"Anan?\" said the old man, who was pinching the ears of the hound, as a\nfather would play with the same member in a favourite child.\n\n\"I incline not to this irregular mode of experimenting on fluids. The\nvessel has neither form, nor proportions.\"\n\n\"It is not as handsomely turned as I have seen a canoe in birchen bark,\nbut comfort may be taken in a wigwam as well as in a palace.\"\n\n\"It is impossible that any vessel constructed on principles so repugnant\nto science can be safe. This tub, venerable hunter, will never reach the\nopposite shore in safety.\"\n\n\"You are a witness of what it has done.\"\n\n\"Ay; but it was an anomaly in prosperity. If exceptions were to be taken\nas rules, in the government of things, the human race would speedily be\nplunged in the abysses of ignorance. Venerable trapper, this expedient,\nin which you would repose your safety, is, in the annals of regular\ninventions, what a lusus naturae may be termed in the lists of natural\nhistory--a monster!\"\n\nHow much longer Doctor Battius might have felt disposed to prolong\nthe discourse, it is difficult to say, for in addition to the powerful\npersonal considerations, which induced him to procrastinate an\nexperiment which was certainly not without its dangers, the pride of\nreason was beginning to sustain him in the discussion. But, fortunately\nfor the credit of the old man's forbearance, when the naturalist reached\nthe word, with which he terminated his last speech, a sound arose in\nthe air that seemed a sort of supernatural echo to the idea itself. The\nyoung Pawnee, who had awaited the termination of the incomprehensible\ndiscussion, with grave and characteristic patience, raised his head, and\nlistened to the unknown cry, like a stag, whose mysterious faculties had\ndetected the footsteps of the distant hounds in the gale. The trapper\nand the Doctor were not, however, entirely so uninstructed as to the\nnature of the extraordinary sounds. The latter recognised in them the\nwell-known voice of his own beast, and he was about to rush up the\nlittle bank, which confined the current, with all the longings of strong\naffection, when Asinus himself galloped into view, at no great distance,\nurged to the unnatural gait by the impatient and brutal Weucha, who\nbestrode him.\n\nThe eyes of the Teton, and those of the fugitives met. The former raised\na long, loud, and piercing yell, in which the notes of exultation\nwere fearfully blended with those of warning. The signal served for a\nfinishing blow to the discussion on the merits of the bark, the Doctor\nstepping as promptly to the side of the old man, as if a mental mist had\nbeen miraculously removed from his eyes. In another instant the steed of\nthe young Pawnee was struggling with the torrent.\n\nThe utmost strength of the horse was needed to urge the fugitives,\nbeyond the flight of arrows that came sailing through the air, at the\nnext moment. The cry of Weucha had brought fifty of his comrades to\nthe shore, but fortunately among them all, there was not one of a rank\nsufficient to entitle him to the privilege of bearing a fusee. One half\nthe stream, however, was not passed, before the form of Mahtoree himself\nwas seen on its bank, and an ineffectual discharge of firearms announced\nthe rage and disappointment of the chief. More than once the trapper had\nraised his rifle, as if about to try its power on his enemies, but he as\noften lowered it, without firing. The eyes of the Pawnee warrior glared\nlike those of the cougar, at the sight of so many of the hostile tribe,\nand he answered the impotent effort of their chief, by tossing a hand\ninto the air in contempt, and raising the war-cry of his nation. The\nchallenge was too taunting to be endured. The Tetons dashed into the\nstream in a body, and the river became dotted with the dark forms of\nbeasts and riders.\n\nThere was now a fearful struggle for the friendly bank. As the Dahcotahs\nadvanced with beasts, which had not, like that of the Pawnee, expended\ntheir strength in former efforts, and as they moved unincumbered by any\nthing but their riders, the speed of the pursuers greatly outstripped\nthat of the fugitives. The trapper, who clearly comprehended the whole\ndanger of their situation, calmly turned his eyes from the Tetons to his\nyoung Indian associate, in order to examine whether the resolution of\nthe latter began to falter, as the former lessened the distance between\nthem. Instead of betraying fear, however, or any of that concern which\nmight so readily have been excited by the peculiarity of his risk, the\nbrow of the young warrior contracted to a look which indicated high and\ndeadly hostility.\n\n\"Do you greatly value life, friend Doctor?\" demanded the old man, with a\nsort of philosophical calmness, which made the question doubly appalling\nto his companion.\n\n\"Not for itself,\" returned the naturalist, sipping some of the water\nof the river from the hollow of his hand, in order to clear his husky\nthroat. \"Not for itself, but exceedingly, inasmuch as natural history\nhas so deep a stake in my existence. Therefore--\"\n\n\"Ay!\" resumed the other, who mused too deeply to dissect the ideas\nof the Doctor with his usual sagacity, \"'tis in truth the history of\nnatur', and a base and craven feeling it is! Now is life as precious to\nthis young Pawnee, as to any governor in the States, and he might save\nit, or at least stand some chance of saving it, by letting us go down\nthe stream; and yet you see he keeps his faith manfully, and like an\nIndian warrior. For myself, I am old, and willing to take the fortune\nthat the Lord may see fit to give, nor do I conceit that you are of much\nbenefit to mankind; and it is a crying shame, if not a sin, that so fine\na youth as this should lose his scalp for two beings so worthless\nas ourselves. I am therefore disposed, provided that it shall prove\nagreeable to you, to tell the lad to make the best of his way, and to\nleave us to the mercy of the Tetons.\"\n\n\"I repel the proposition, as repugnant to nature, and as treason to\nscience!\" exclaimed the alarmed naturalist. \"Our progress is miraculous;\nand as this admirable invention moves with so wonderful a facility, a\nfew more minutes will serve to bring us to land.\"\n\nThe old man regarded him intently for an instant, and shaking his head\nhe said--\n\n\"Lord, what a thing is fear! it transforms the creatur's of the world\nand the craft of man, making that which is ugly, seemly in our eyes, and\nthat which is beautiful, unsightly! Lord, Lord, what a thing is fear!\"\n\nA termination was, however, put to the discussion, by the increasing\ninterest of the chase. The horses of the Dahcotahs had, by this time,\ngained the middle of the current, and their riders were already filling\nthe air with yells of triumph. At this moment Middleton and Paul who had\nled the females to a little thicket, appeared again on the margin of the\nstream, menacing their enemies with the rifle.\n\n\"Mount, mount,\" shouted the trapper, the instant he beheld them; \"mount\nand fly, if you value those who lean on you for help. Mount, and leave\nus in the hands of the Lord.\"\n\n\"Stoop your head, old trapper,\" returned the voice of Paul, \"down with\nye both into your nest. The Teton devil is in your line; down with your\nheads and make way for a Kentucky bullet.\"\n\nThe old man turned his head, and saw that the eager Mahtoree, who\npreceded his party some distance, had brought himself nearly in a line\nwith the bark and the bee-hunter, who stood perfectly ready to execute\nhis hostile threat. Bending his body low, the rifle was discharged, and\nthe swift lead whizzed harmlessly past him, on its more distant errand.\nBut the eye of the Teton chief was not less quick and certain than that\nof his enemy. He threw himself from his horse the moment preceding\nthe report, and sunk into the water. The beast snorted with terror and\nanguish, throwing half his form out of the river in a desperate plunge.\nThen he was seen drifting away in the torrent, and dyeing the turbid\nwaters with his blood.\n\nThe Teton chief soon re-appeared on the surface, and understanding the\nnature of his loss, he swam with vigorous strokes to the nearest of\nthe young men, who relinquished his steed, as a matter of course, to so\nrenowned a warrior. The incident, however, created a confusion in the\nwhole of the Dahcotah band, who appeared to await the intention of their\nleader, before they renewed their efforts to reach the shore. In the\nmean time the vessel of skin had reached the land, and the fugitives\nwere once more united on the margin of the river.\n\nThe savages were now swimming about in indecision, as a flock of pigeons\nis often seen to hover in confusion after receiving a heavy discharge\ninto its leading column, apparently hesitating on the risk of storming a\nbank so formidably defended. The well-known precaution of Indian warfare\nprevailed, and Mahtoree, admonished by his recent adventure, led his\nwarriors back to the shore from which they had come, in order to relieve\ntheir beasts, which were already becoming unruly.\n\n\"Now mount you, with the tender ones, and ride for yonder hillock,\" said\nthe trapper; \"beyond it, you will find another stream, into which you\nmust enter, and turning to the sun, follow its bed for a mile, until\nyou reach a high and sandy plain; there will I meet you. Go; mount;\nthis Pawnee youth and I, and my stout friend the physician, who is a\ndesperate warrior, are men enough to keep the bank, seeing that show and\nnot use is all that is needed.\"\n\nMiddleton and Paul saw no use in wasting their breath in remonstrances\nagainst this proposal. Glad to know that their rear was to be covered,\neven in this imperfect manner, they hastily got their horses in motion,\nand soon disappeared on the required route. Some twenty or thirty\nminutes succeeded this movement before the Tetons on the opposite shore\nseemed inclined to enter on any new enterprise. Mahtoree was distinctly\nvisible, in the midst of his warriors, issuing his mandates and\nbetraying his desire for vengeance, by occasionally shaking an arm in\nthe direction of the fugitives; but no step was taken, which appeared to\nthreaten any further act of immediate hostility. At length a yell arose\namong the savages, which announced the occurrence of some fresh event.\nThen Ishmael and his sluggish sons were seen in the distance, and soon\nthe whole of the united force moved down to the very limits of the\nstream. The squatter proceeded to examine the position of his enemies,\nwith his usual coolness, and, as if to try the power of his rifle, he\nsent a bullet among them, with a force sufficient to do execution, even\nat the distance at which he stood.\n\n\"Now let us depart!\" exclaimed Obed, endeavouring to catch a furtive\nglimpse of the lead, which he fancied was whizzing at his very ear; \"we\nhave maintained the bank in a gallant manner, for a sufficient length of\ntime; quite as much military skill is to be displayed in a retreat, as\nin an advance.\"\n\nThe old man cast a look behind him, and seeing that the equestrians had\nreached the cover of the hill, he made no objections to the proposal.\nThe remaining horse was given to the Doctor, with instructions to pursue\nthe course just taken by Middleton and Paul. When the naturalist was\nmounted and in full retreat, the trapper and the young Pawnee stole from\nthe spot in such a manner as to leave their enemies some time in doubt\nas to their movements. Instead, however, of proceeding across the plain\ntowards the hill, a route on which they must have been in open view,\nthey took a shorter path, covered by the formation of the ground, and\nintersected the little water-course at the point where Middleton had\nbeen directed to leave it, and just in season to join his party. The\nDoctor had used so much diligence in the retreat, as to have already\novertaken his friends, and of course all the fugitives were again\nassembled.\n\nThe trapper now looked about him for some convenient spot, where the\nwhole party might halt, as he expressed it, for some five or six hours.\n\n\"Halt!\" exclaimed the Doctor, when the alarming proposal reached his\nears; \"venerable hunter, it would seem, that on the contrary, many days\nshould be passed in industrious flight.\"\n\nMiddleton and Paul were both of this opinion, and each in his particular\nmanner expressed as much.\n\nThe old man heard them with patience, but shook his head like one who\nwas unconvinced, and then answered all their arguments, in one general\nand positive reply.\n\n\"Why should we fly?\" he asked. \"Can the legs of mortal men outstrip the\nspeed of horses? Do you think the Tetons will lie down and sleep; or\nwill they cross the water and nose for our trail? Thanks be to the Lord,\nwe have washed it well in this stream, and if we leave the place with\ndiscretion and wisdom, we may yet throw them off its track. But a\nprairie is not a wood. There a man may journey long, caring for nothing\nbut the prints his moccasin leaves, whereas in these open plains a\nrunner, placed on yonder hill, for instance, could see far on every side\nof him, like a hovering hawk looking down on his prey. No, no; night\nmust come, and darkness be upon us, afore we leave this spot. But listen\nto the words of the Pawnee; he is a lad of spirit, and I warrant me many\nis the hard race that he has run with the Sioux bands. Does my brother\nthink our trail is long enough?\" he demanded in the Indian tongue.\n\n\"Is a Teton a fish, that he can see it in the river?\"\n\n\"But my young men think we should stretch it, until it reaches across\nthe prairie.\"\n\n\"Mahtoree has eyes; he will see it.\"\n\n\"What does my brother counsel?\"\n\nThe young warrior studied the heavens a moment, and appeared to\nhesitate. He mused some time with himself, and then he replied, like one\nwhose opinion was fixed--\n\n\"The Dahcotahs are not asleep,\" he said; \"we must lie in the grass.\"\n\n\"Ah! the lad is of my mind,\" said the old man, briefly explaining the\nopinion of his companion to his white friends. Middleton was obliged\nto acquiesce, and, as it was confessedly dangerous to remain upon their\nfeet, each one set about assisting in the means to be adopted for their\nsecurity. Inez and Ellen were quickly bestowed beneath the warm and\nnot uncomfortable shelter of the buffaloe skins, which formed a thick\ncovering, and tall grass was drawn over the place, in such a manner as\nto evade any examination from a common eye. Paul and the Pawnee fettered\nthe beasts and cast them to the earth, where, after supplying them with\nfood, they were also left concealed in the fog of the prairie. No time\nwas lost when these several arrangements were completed, before each of\nthe others sought a place of rest and concealment, and then the plain\nappeared again deserted to its solitude.\n\nThe old man had advised his companions of the absolute necessity of\ntheir continuing for hours in this concealment. All their hopes of\nescape depended on the success of the artifice. If they might elude the\ncunning of their pursuers, by this simple and therefore less suspected\nexpedient, they could renew their flight as the evening approached, and,\nby changing their course, the chance of final success would be greatly\nincreased. Influenced by these momentous considerations the whole party\nlay, musing on their situation, until thoughts grew weary, and sleep\nfinally settled on them all, one after another.\n\nThe deepest silence had prevailed for hours, when the quick ears of the\ntrapper and the Pawnee were startled by a faint cry of surprise from\nInez. Springing to their feet, like men, who were about to struggle for\ntheir lives, they found the vast plain, the rolling swells, the little\nhillock, and the scattered thickets, covered alike in one, white,\ndazzling sheet of snow.\n\n\"The Lord have mercy on ye all!\" exclaimed the old man, regarding the\nprospect with a rueful eye; \"now, Pawnee, do I know the reason why you\nstudied the clouds so closely; but it is too late; it is too late! A\nsquirrel would leave his trail on this light coating of the 'arth. Ha!\nthere come the imps to a certainty. Down with ye all, down with ye; your\nchance is but small, and yet it must not be wilfully cast away.\"\n\nThe whole party was instantly concealed again, though many an anxious\nand stolen glance was directed through the tops of the grass, on the\nmovements of their enemies. At the distance of half a mile, the Teton\nband was seen riding in a circuit, which was gradually contracting\nitself, and evidently closing upon the very spot where the fugitives\nlay. There was but little difficulty in solving the mystery of this\nmovement. The snow had fallen in time to assure them that those\nthey sought were in their rear, and they were now employed, with the\nunwearied perseverance and patience of Indian warriors, in circling the\ncertain boundaries of their place of concealment.\n\nEach minute added to the jeopardy of the fugitives. Paul and Middleton\ndeliberately prepared their rifles, and as the occupied Mahtoree came,\nat length, within fifty feet of them, keeping his eyes riveted on the\ngrass through which he rode, they levelled them together and pulled the\ntriggers. The effort was answered by the mere snapping of the locks.\n\n\"Enough,\" said the old man, rising with dignity; \"I have cast away the\npriming; for certain death would follow your rashness. Now let us meet\nour fates like men. Cringing and complaining find no favour in Indian\neyes.\"\n\nHis appearance was greeted by a yell, that spread far and wide over the\nplain, and in a moment a hundred savages were seen riding madly to the\nspot. Mahtoree received his prisoners with great self-restraint, though\na single gleam of fierce joy broke through his clouded brow, and the\nheart of Middleton grew cold as he caught the expression of that eye,\nwhich the chief turned on the nearly insensible but still lovely Inez.\n\nThe exultation of receiving the white captives was so great, as for\na time to throw the dark and immovable form of their young Indian\ncompanion entirely out of view. He stood apart, disdaining to turn an\neye on his enemies, as motionless as if he were frozen in that attitude\nof dignity and composure. But when a little time had passed, even this\nsecondary object attracted the attention of the Tetons. Then it was that\nthe trapper first learned, by the shout of triumph and the long drawn\nyell of delight, which burst at once from a hundred throats, as well as\nby the terrible name, which filled the air, that his youthful friend\nwas no other than that redoubtable and hitherto invincible warrior,\nHard-Heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n            What, are ancient Pistol and you friends, yet?\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nThe curtain of our imperfect drama must fall, to rise upon another\nscene. The time is advanced several days, during which very material\nchanges had occurred in the situation of the actors. The hour is noon,\nand the place an elevated plain, that rose, at no great distance from\nthe water, somewhat abruptly from a fertile bottom, which stretched\nalong the margin of one of the numberless water-courses of that region.\nThe river took its rise near the base of the Rocky Mountains, and,\nafter washing a vast extent of plain, it mingled its waters with a\nstill larger stream, to become finally lost in the turbid current of the\nMissouri.\n\nThe landscape was changed materially for the better; though the hand,\nwhich had impressed so much of the desert on the surrounding region, had\nlaid a portion of its power on this spot. The appearance of vegetation\nwas, however, less discouraging than in the more sterile wastes of the\nrolling prairies. Clusters of trees were scattered in greater profusion,\nand a long outline of ragged forest marked the northern boundary of the\nview. Here and there, on the bottom, were to be seen the evidences of a\nhasty and imperfect culture of such indigenous vegetables as were of a\nquick growth, and which were known to flourish, without the aid of art,\nin deep and alluvial soils. On the very edge of what might be called\nthe table-land, were pitched the hundred lodges of a horde of wandering\nSiouxes. Their light tenements were arranged without the least attention\nto order. Proximity to the water seemed to be the only consideration\nwhich had been consulted in their disposition, nor had even this\nimportant convenience been always regarded. While most of the lodges\nstood along the brow of the plain, many were to be seen at greater\ndistances, occupying such places as had first pleased the capricious\neyes of their untutored owners. The encampment was not military, nor\nin the slightest degree protected from surprise by its position or\ndefences. It was open on every side, and on every side as accessible\nas any other point in those wastes, if the imperfect and natural\nobstruction offered by the river be excepted. In short, the place bore\nthe appearance of having been tenanted longer than its occupants had\noriginally intended, while it was not wanting in the signs of readiness\nfor a hasty, or even a compelled departure.\n\nThis was the temporary encampment of that portion of his people, who\nhad long been hunting under the direction of Mahtoree, on those grounds\nwhich separated the stationary abodes of his nation, from those of the\nwarlike tribes of the Pawnees. The lodges were tents of skin, high,\nconical, and of the most simple and primitive construction. The shield,\nthe quiver, the lance and the bow of its master, were to be seen\nsuspended from a light post before the opening, or door, of each\nhabitation. The different domestic implements of his one, two, or three\nwives, as the brave was of greater or lesser renown, were carelessly\nthrown at its side, and here and there the round, full, patient\ncountenance of an infant might be found peeping from its comfortless\nwrappers of bark, as, suspended by a deer-skin thong from the same post,\nit rocked in the passing air. Children of a larger growth were tumbling\nover each other in piles, the males, even at that early age, making\nthemselves distinguished for that species of domination which, in after\nlife, was to mark the vast distinction between the sexes. Youths were in\nthe bottom, essaying their juvenile powers in curbing the wild steeds\nof their fathers, while here and there a truant girl was to be seen,\nstealing from her labours to admire their fierce and impatient daring.\n\nThus far the picture was the daily exhibition of an encampment confident\nin its security. But immediately in front of the lodges was a gathering,\nthat seemed to forbode some movements of more than usual interest. A\nfew of the withered and remorseless crones of the band were clustering\ntogether, in readiness to lend their fell voices, if needed, to aid in\nexciting their descendants to an exhibition, which their depraved tastes\ncoveted, as the luxurious Roman dame witnessed the struggles and the\nagony of the gladiator. The men were subdivided into groups, assorted\naccording to the deeds and reputations of the several individuals of\nwhom they were composed.\n\nThey, who were of that equivocal age which admitted them to the hunts,\nwhile their discretion was still too doubtful to permit them to be\ntrusted on the war-path, hung around the skirts of the whole, catching,\nfrom the fierce models before them, that gravity of demeanour and\nrestraint of manner, which in time was to become so deeply ingrafted in\ntheir own characters. A few of the still older class, and who had heard\nthe whoop in anger, were a little more presuming, pressing nigher to\nthe chiefs, though far from presuming to mingle in their councils,\nsufficiently distinguished by being permitted to catch the wisdom which\nfell from lips so venerated. The ordinary warriors of the band were\nstill less diffident, not hesitating to mingle among the chiefs\nof lesser note, though far from assuming the right to dispute the\nsentiments of any established brave, or to call in question the prudence\nof measures, that were recommended by the more gifted counsellors of the\nnation.\n\nAmong the chiefs themselves there was a singular compound of exterior.\nThey were divided into two classes; those who were mainly indebted for\ntheir influence to physical causes, and to deeds in arms, and those who\nhad become distinguished rather for their wisdom than for their services\nin the field. The former was by far the most numerous and the most\nimportant class. They were men of stature and mien, whose stern\ncountenances were often rendered doubly imposing by those evidences of\ntheir valour, which had been roughly traced on their lineaments by the\nhands of their enemies. That class, which had gained its influence by\na moral ascendency was extremely limited. They were uniformly to be\ndistinguished by the quick and lively expression of their eyes, by the\nair of distrust that marked their movements, and occasionally by the\nvehemence of their utterance in those sudden outbreakings of the\nmind, by which their present consultations were, from time to time,\ndistinguished.\n\nIn the very centre of a ring, formed by these chosen counsellors, was\nto be seen the person of the disquieted, but seemingly calm, Mahtoree.\nThere was a conjunction of all the several qualities of the others in\nhis person and character. Mind as well as matter had contributed to\nestablish his authority. His scars were as numerous and deep as those of\nthe whitest head in his nation; his limbs were in their greatest vigour;\nhis courage at its fullest height. Endowed with this rare combination of\nmoral and physical influence, the keenest eye in all that assembly was\nwont to lower before his threatening glance. Courage and cunning had\nestablished his ascendency, and it had been rendered, in some degree,\nsacred by time. He knew so well how to unite the powers of reason and\nforce, that in a state of society, which admitted of a greater display\nof his energies, the Teton would in all probability have been both a\nconqueror and a despot.\n\nA little apart from the gathering of the band, was to be seen a set of\nbeings of an entirely different origin. Taller and far more muscular in\ntheir persons, the lingering vestiges of their Saxon and Norman ancestry\nwere yet to be found beneath the swarthy complexions, which had been\nbestowed by an American sun. It would have been a curious investigation,\nfor one skilled in such an enquiry, to have traced those points of\ndifference, by which the offspring of the most western European was\nstill to be distinguished from the descendant of the most remote\nAsiatic, now that the two, in the revolutions of the world, were\napproximating in their habits, their residence, and not a little in\ntheir characters. The group, of whom we write, was composed of the\nfamily of the squatter. They stood indolent, lounging, and inert, as\nusual when no immediate demand was made on their dormant energies,\nclustered in front of some four or five habitations of skin, for which\nthey were indebted to the hospitality of their Teton allies. The terms\nof their unexpected confederation were sufficiently explained, by the\npresence of the horses and domestic cattle that were quietly grazing on\nthe bottom beneath, under the jealous eyes of the spirited Hetty. Their\nwagons were drawn about the lodges, in a sort of irregular barrier,\nwhich at once manifested that their confidence was not entirely\nrestored, while, on the other hand, their policy or indolence prevented\nany very positive exhibition of distrust. There was a singular union\nof passive enjoyment and of dull curiosity slumbering in every dull\ncountenance, as each of the party stood leaning on his rifle, regarding\nthe movements of the Sioux conference. Still no sign of expectation or\ninterest escaped from the youngest among them, the whole appearing to\nemulate the most phlegmatic of their savage allies, in an exhibition of\npatience. They rarely spoke; and when they did it was in some short and\ncontemptuous remark, which served to put the physical superiority of a\nwhite man, and that of an Indian, in a sufficiently striking point\nof view. In short, the family of Ishmael appeared now to be in the\nplenitude of an enjoyment, which depended on inactivity, but which was\nnot entirely free from certain confused glimmerings of a perspective, in\nwhich their security stood in some little danger of a rude interruption\nfrom Teton treachery. Abiram, alone, formed a solitary exception to this\nstate of equivocal repose.\n\nAfter a life passed in the commission of a thousand mean and\ninsignificant villanies, the mind of the kidnapper had become hardy\nenough to attempt the desperate adventure, which has been laid before\nthe reader, in the course of the narrative. His influence over the\nbolder, but less active, spirit of Ishmael was far from great, and had\nnot the latter been suddenly expelled from a fertile bottom, of which he\nhad taken possession, with intent to keep it, without much deference to\nthe forms of law, he would never have succeeded in enlisting the husband\nof his sister in an enterprise that required so much decision and\nforethought. Their original success and subsequent disappointment have\nbeen seen; and Abiram now sat apart, plotting the means, by which he\nmight secure to himself the advantages of his undertaking, which he\nperceived were each moment becoming more uncertain, through the open\nadmiration of Mahtoree for the innocent subject of his villany. We shall\nleave him to his vacillating and confused expedients, in order to pass\nto the description of certain other personages in the drama.\n\nThere was still another corner of the picture that was occupied. On a\nlittle bank, at the extreme right of the encampment, lay the forms of\nMiddleton and Paul. Their limbs were painfully bound with thongs, cut\nfrom the skin of a bison, while, by a sort of refinement in cruelty,\nthey were so placed, that each could see a reflection of his own misery\nin the case of his neighbour. Within a dozen yards of them a post\nwas set firmly in the ground, and against it was bound the light and\nApollo-like person of Hard-Heart. Between the two stood the trapper,\ndeprived of his rifle, his pouch and his horn, but otherwise left in a\nsort of contemptuous liberty. Some five or six young warriors, however,\nwith quivers at their backs, and long tough bows dangling from their\nshoulders, who stood with grave watchfulness at no great distance from\nthe spot, sufficiently proclaimed how fruitless any attempt to escape,\non the part of one so aged and so feeble, might prove. Unlike the other\nspectators of the important conference, these individuals were engaged\nin a discourse that for them contained an interest of its own.\n\n\"Captain,\" said the bee-hunter with an expression of comical concern,\nthat no misfortune could depress in one of his buoyant feelings, \"do you\nreally find that accursed strap of untanned leather cutting into your\nshoulder, or is it only the tickling in my own arm that I feel?\"\n\n\"When the spirit suffers so deeply, the body is insensible to pain,\"\nreturned the more refined, though scarcely so spirited Middleton; \"would\nto Heaven that some of my trusty artillerists might fall upon this\naccursed encampment!\"\n\n\"You might as well wish that these Teton lodges were so many hives of\nhornets, and that the insects would come forth and battle with yonder\ntribe of half naked savages.\" Then, chuckling with his own conceit, the\nbee-hunter turned away from his companion, and sought a momentary relief\nfrom his misery, by imagining that so wild an idea might be realised,\nand fancying the manner, in which the attack would upset even the well\nestablished patience of an Indian.\n\nMiddleton was glad to be silent; but the old man, who had listened to\ntheir words, drew a little nigher, and continued the discourse.\n\n\"Here is likely to be a merciless and a hellish business!\" he said,\nshaking his head in a manner to prove that even his experience was at a\nloss for a remedy in so trying a dilemma. \"Our Pawnee friend is already\nstaked for the torture, and I well know, by the eye and the countenance\nof the great Sioux, that he is leading on the temper of his people to\nfurther enormities.\"\n\n\"Harkee, old trapper,\" said Paul, writhing in his bonds to catch a\nglimpse of the other's melancholy face; \"you ar' skilled in Indian\ntongues, and know somewhat of Indian deviltries. Go you to the council,\nand tell their chiefs in my name, that is to say, in the name of Paul\nHover, of the state of Kentucky, that provided they will guarantee the\nsafe return of one Ellen Wade into the States, they are welcome to take\nhis scalp when and in such manner as best suits their amusements; or,\nif-so-be they will not trade on these conditions, you may throw in an\nhour or two of torture before hand, in order to sweeten the bargain to\ntheir damnable appetites.\"\n\n\"Ah! lad, it is little they would hearken to such an offer, knowing, as\nthey do, that you are already like a bear in a trap, as little able to\nfight as to fly. But be not down-hearted, for the colour of a white man\nis sometimes his death-warrant among these far tribes of savages, and\nsometimes his shield. Though they love us not, cunning often ties their\nhands. Could the red nations work their will, trees would shortly be\ngrowing again on the ploughed fields of America, and woods would be\nwhitened with Christian bones. No one can doubt that, who knows the\nquality of the love which a Red-skin bears a Pale-face; but they have\ncounted our numbers until their memories fail them, and they are not\nwithout their policy. Therefore is our fate unsettled; but I fear me\nthere is small hope left for the Pawnee!\"\n\nAs the old man concluded, he walked slowly towards the subject of his\nlatter observation, taking his post at no great distance from his\nside. Here he stood, observing such a silence and mien as became him\nto manifest, to a chief so renowned and so situated as his captive\nassociate. But the eye of Hard-Heart was fastened on the distance, and\nhis whole air was that of one whose thoughts were entirely removed from\nthe present scene.\n\n\"The Siouxes are in council on my brother,\" the trapper at length\nobserved, when he found he could only attract the other's attention by\nspeaking.\n\nThe young partisan turned his head with a calm smile as he answered\n\"They are counting the scalps over the lodge of Hard-Heart!\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt; their tempers begin to mount, as they remember the\nnumber of Tetons you have struck, and better would it be for you now,\nhad more of your days been spent in chasing the deer, and fewer on the\nwar-path. Then some childless mother of this tribe might take you in the\nplace of her lost son, and your time would be filled in peace.\"\n\n\"Does my father think that a warrior can ever die? The Master of Life\ndoes not open his hand to take away his gifts again. When He wants\nHis young men He calls them, and they go. But the Red-skin He has once\nbreathed on lives for ever.\"\n\n\"Ay, this is a more comfortable and a more humble faith than that which\nyonder heartless Teton harbours. There is something in these Loups which\nopens my inmost heart to them; they seem to have the courage, ay, and\nthe honesty, too, of the Delawares of the hills. And this lad--it is\nwonderful, it is very wonderful; but the age, and the eye, and the limbs\nare as if they might have been brothers! Tell me, Pawnee, have you ever\nin your traditions heard of a mighty people who once lived on the shores\nof the Salt-lake, hard by the rising sun?\"\n\n\"The earth is white, by people of the colour of my father.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, I speak not now of any strollers, who have crept into the\nland to rob the lawful owners of their birth-right, but of a people who\nare, or rather were, what with nature and what with paint, red as the\nberry on the bush.\"\n\n\"I have heard the old men say, that there were bands, who hid themselves\nin the woods under the rising sun, because they dared not come upon the\nopen prairies to fight with men.\"\n\n\"Do not your traditions tell you of the greatest, the bravest, and the\nwisest nation of Red-skins that the Wahcondah has ever breathed upon?\"\n\nHard-Heart raised his head, with a loftiness and dignity that even his\nbonds could not repress, as he answered--\n\n\"Has age blinded my father; or does he see so many Siouxes, that he\nbelieves there are no longer any Pawnees?\"\n\n\"Ah! such is mortal vanity and pride!\" exclaimed the disappointed old\nman, in English. \"Natur' is as strong in a Red-skin, as in the bosom of\na man of white gifts. Now would a Delaware conceit himself far mightier\nthan a Pawnee, just as a Pawnee boasts himself to be of the princes of\nthe 'arth. And so it was atween the Frenchers of the Canadas and the\nred-coated English, that the king did use to send into the States, when\nStates they were not, but outcrying and petitioning provinces, they\nfou't and they fou't, and what marvellous boastings did they give forth\nto the world of their own valour and victories, while both parties\nforgot to name the humble soldier of the land, who did the real service,\nbut who, as he was not privileged then to smoke at the great council\nfire of his nation, seldom heard of his deeds, after they were once\nbravely done.\"\n\nWhen the old man had thus given vent to the nearly dormant, but far from\nextinct, military pride, that had so unconsciously led him into the very\nerror he deprecated, his eye, which had begun to quicken and glimmer\nwith some of the ardour of his youth, softened and turned its anxious\nlook on the devoted captive, whose countenance was also restored to its\nformer cold look of abstraction and thought.\n\n\"Young warrior,\" he continued in a voice that was growing tremulous, \"I\nhave never been father, or brother. The Wahcondah made me to live alone.\nHe never tied my heart to house or field, by the cords with which the\nmen of my race are bound to their lodges; if he had, I should not have\njourneyed so far, and seen so much. But I have tarried long among a\npeople, who lived in those woods you mention, and much reason did I find\nto imitate their courage and love their honesty. The Master of Life has\nmade us all, Pawnee, with a feeling for our kind. I never was a father,\nbut well do I know what is the love of one. You are like a lad I valued,\nand I had even begun to fancy that some of his blood might be in your\nveins. But what matters that? You are a true man, as I know by the\nway in which you keep your faith; and honesty is a gift too rare to be\nforgotten. My heart yearns to you, boy, and gladly would I do you good.\"\n\nThe youthful warrior listened to the words, which came from the lips of\nthe other with a force and simplicity that established their truth, and\nhe bowed his head on his naked bosom, in testimony of the respect with\nwhich he met the proffer. Then lifting his dark eye to the level of the\nview, he seemed to be again considering of things removed from every\npersonal consideration. The trapper, who well knew how high the pride\nof a warrior would sustain him, in those moments he believed to be his\nlast, awaited the pleasure of his young friend, with a meekness and\npatience that he had acquired by his association with that remarkable\nrace. At length the gaze of the Pawnee began to waver; and then quick,\nflashing glances were turned from the countenance of the old man to the\nair, and from the air to his deeply marked lineaments again, as if the\nspirit, which governed their movements, was beginning to be troubled.\n\n\"Father,\" the young brave finally answered in a voice of confidence and\nkindness, \"I have heard your words. They have gone in at my ears,\nand are now within me. The white-headed Long-knife has no son; the\nHard-Heart of the Pawnees is young, but he is already the oldest of his\nfamily. He found the bones of his father on the hunting ground of the\nOsages, and he has sent them to the prairies of the Good Spirits. No\ndoubt the great chief, his father, has seen them, and knows what is part\nof himself. But the Wahcondah will soon call to us both; you, because\nyou have seen all that is to be seen in this country; and Hard-Heart,\nbecause he has need of a warrior, who is young. There is no time for the\nPawnee to show the Pale-face the duty, that a son owes to his father.\"\n\n\"Old as I am, and miserable and helpless as I now stand, to what I\nonce was, I may live to see the sun go down in the prairie. Does my son\nexpect to do as much?\"\n\n\"The Tetons are counting the scalps on my lodge!\" returned the young\nchief, with a smile whose melancholy was singularly illuminated by a\ngleam of triumph.\n\n\"And they find them many. Too many for the safety of its owner, while he\nis in their revengeful hands. My son is not a woman, and he looks on the\npath he is about to travel with a steady eye. Has he nothing to whisper\nin the ears of his people, before he starts? These legs are old, but\nthey may yet carry me to the forks of the Loup river.\"\n\n\"Tell them that Hard-Heart has tied a knot in his wampum for every\nTeton,\" burst from the lips of the captive, with that vehemence\nwith which sudden passion is known to break through the barriers of\nartificial restraint \"if he meets one of them all, in the prairies of\nthe Master of Life, his heart will become Sioux!\"\n\n\"Ah that feeling would be a dangerous companion for a man with white\ngifts to start with on so solemn a journey,\" muttered the old man in\nEnglish. \"This is not what the good Moravians said to the councils of\nthe Delawares, nor what is so often preached, to the White-skins in the\nsettlements, though, to the shame of the colour be it said, it is so\nlittle heeded. Pawnee, I love you; but being a Christian man, I cannot\nbe the runner to bear such a message.\"\n\n\"If my father is afraid the Tetons will hear him, let him whisper it\nsoftly to our old men.\"\n\n\"As for fear, young warrior, it is no more the shame of a Pale-face than\nof a Red-skin. The Wahcondah teaches us to love the life he gives; but\nit is as men love their hunts, and their dogs, and their carabines, and\nnot with the doting that a mother looks upon her infant. The Master of\nLife will not have to speak aloud twice when he calls my name. I am as\nready to answer to it now, as I shall be to-morrow, or at any time\nit may please his mighty will. But what is a warrior without his\ntraditions? Mine forbid me to carry your words.\"\n\nThe chief made a dignified motion of assent, and here there was great\ndanger that those feelings of confidence, which had been so singularly\nawakened, would as suddenly subside. But the heart of the old man\nhad been too sensibly touched, through long dormant but still living\nrecollections, to break off the communication so rudely. He pondered for\na minute, and then bending his look wistfully on his young associate,\nagain continued--\n\n\"Each warrior must be judged by his gifts. I have told my son what I\ncannot, but let him open his ears to what I can do. An elk shall not\nmeasure the prairie much swifter than these old legs, if the Pawnee will\ngive me a message that a white man may bear.\"\n\n\"Let the Pale-face listen,\" returned the other, after hesitating\na single instant longer, under a lingering sensation of his former\ndisappointment. \"He will stay here till the Siouxes have done counting\nthe scalps of their dead warriors. He will wait until they have tried to\ncover the heads of eighteen Tetons with the skin of one Pawnee; he will\nopen his eyes wide, that he may see the place where they bury the bones\nof a warrior.\"\n\n\"All this will I, and may I, do, noble boy.\"\n\n\"He will mark the spot, that he may know it.\"\n\n\"No fear, no fear that I shall forget the place,\" interrupted the other,\nwhose fortitude began to give way under so trying an exhibition of\ncalmness and resignation.\n\n\"Then I know that my father will go to my people. His head is grey,\nand his words will not be blown away with the smoke. Let him get on my\nlodge, and call the name of Hard-Heart aloud. No Pawnee will be deaf.\nThen let my father ask for the colt, that has never been ridden, but\nwhich is sleeker than the buck, and swifter than the elk.\"\n\n\"I understand you, boy, I understand you,\" interrupted the attentive old\nman; \"and what you say shall be done, ay, and well done too, or I'm but\nlittle skilled in the wishes of a dying Indian.\"\n\n\"And when my young men have given my father the halter of that colt, he\nwill lead him by a crooked path to the grave of Hard-Heart?\"\n\n\"Will I! ay, that I will, brave youth, though the winter covers these\nplains in banks of snow, and the sun is hidden as much by day as by\nnight. To the head of the holy spot will I lead the beast, and place him\nwith his eyes looking towards the setting sun.\"\n\n\"And my father will speak to him, and tell him, that the master, who has\nfed him since he was foaled, has now need of him.\"\n\n\"That, too, will I do; though the Lord he knows that I shall hold\ndiscourse with a horse, not with any vain conceit that my words will\nbe understood, but only to satisfy the cravings of Indian superstition.\nHector, my pup, what think you, dog, of talking to a horse?\"\n\n\"Let the grey-beard speak to him with the tongue of a Pawnee,\"\ninterrupted the young victim, perceiving that his companion had used an\nunknown language for the preceding speech.\n\n\"My son's will shall be done. And with these old hands, which I had\nhoped had nearly done with bloodshed, whether it be of man or beast,\nwill I slay the animal on your grave!\"\n\n\"It is good,\" returned the other, a gleam of satisfaction flitting\nacross his features. \"Hard-Heart will ride his horse to the blessed\nprairies, and he will come before the Master of Life like a chief!\"\n\nThe sudden and striking change, which instantly occurred in the\ncountenance of the Indian, caused the trapper to look aside, when\nhe perceived that the conference of the Siouxes had ended, and that\nMahtoree, attended by one or two of the principal warriors, was\ndeliberately approaching his intended victim.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n              I am not prone to weeping, as our sex\n              Commonly are.\n                      --But I have that honourable\n              Grief lodged here, which burns worse than\n              Tears drown\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nWhen within twenty feet of the prisoners, the Tetons stopped, and their\nleader made a sign to the old man to draw nigh. The trapper obeyed,\nquitting the young Pawnee with a significant look, which was received,\nas it was meant, for an additional pledge that he would never forget\nhis promise. So soon as Mahtoree found that the other had stopped within\nreach of him, he stretched forth his arm, and laying a hand upon the\nshoulder of the attentive old man, he stood regarding him, a minute,\nwith eyes that seemed willing to penetrate the recesses of his most\nsecret thoughts.\n\n\"Is a Pale-face always made with two tongues?\" he demanded, when he\nfound that, as usual, with the subject of this examination, he was as\nlittle intimidated by his present frown, as moved by any apprehensions\nof the future.\n\n\"Honesty lies deeper than the skin.\"\n\n\"It is so. Now let my father hear me. Mahtoree has but one tongue, the\ngrey-head has many. They may be all straight, and none of them forked.\nA Sioux is no more than a Sioux, but a Pale-face is every thing! He can\ntalk to the Pawnee, and the Konza, and the Omawhaw, and he can talk to\nhis own people.\"\n\n\"Ay, there are linguists in the settlements that can do still more. But\nwhat profits it all? The Master of Life has an ear for every language!\"\n\n\"The grey-head has done wrong. He has said one thing when he meant\nanother. He has looked before him with his eyes, and behind him with\nhis mind. He has ridden the horse of a Sioux too hard; he has been the\nfriend of a Pawnee, and the enemy of my people.\"\n\n\"Teton, I am your prisoner. Though my words are white, they will not\ncomplain. Act your will.\"\n\n\"No. Mahtoree will not make a white hair red. My father is free. The\nprairie is open on every side of him. But before the grey-head turns his\nback on the Siouxes, let him look well at them, that he may tell his own\nchief, how great is a Dahcotah!\"\n\n\"I am not in a hurry to go on my path. You see a man with a white head,\nand no woman, Teton; therefore shall I not run myself out of breath, to\ntell the nations of the prairies what the Siouxes are doing.\"\n\n\"It is good. My father has smoked with the chiefs at many councils,\"\nreturned Mahtoree, who now thought himself sufficiently sure of the\nother's favour to go more directly to his object. \"Mahtoree will speak\nwith the tongue of his very dear friend and father. A young Pale-face\nwill listen when an old man of that nation opens his mouth. Go; my\nfather will make what a poor Indian says fit for a white ear.\"\n\n\"Speak aloud!\" said the trapper, who readily understood the metaphorical\nmanner, in which the Teton expressed a desire that he should become an\ninterpreter of his words into the English language; \"speak, my young men\nlisten. Now, captain, and you too, friend bee-hunter, prepare yourselves\nto meet the deviltries of this savage, with the stout hearts of white\nwarriors. If you find yourselves giving way under his threats, just turn\nyour eyes on that noble-looking Pawnee, whose time is measured with a\nhand as niggardly, as that with which a trader in the towns gives\nforth the fruits of the Lord, inch by inch, in order to satisfy\nhis covetousness. A single look at the boy will set you both up in\nresolution.\"\n\n\"My brother has turned his eyes on the wrong path,\" interrupted\nMahtoree, with a complacency that betrayed how unwilling he was to\noffend his intended interpreter.\n\n\"The Dahcotah will speak to my young men?\"\n\n\"After he has sung in the ear of the flower of the Pale-faces.\"\n\n\"The Lord forgive the desperate villain!\" exclaimed the old man in\nEnglish. \"There are none so tender, or so young, or so innocent, as to\nescape his ravenous wishes. But hard words and cold looks will profit\nnothing; therefore it will be wise to speak him fair. Let Mahtoree open\nhis mouth.\"\n\n\"Would my father cry out, that the women and children should hear the\nwisdom of chiefs! We will go into the lodge and whisper.\"\n\nAs the Teton ended, he pointed significantly towards a tent, vividly\nemblazoned with the history of one of his own boldest and most commended\nexploits, and which stood a little apart from the rest, as if to denote\nit was the residence of some privileged individual of the band. The\nshield and quiver at its entrance were richer than common, and the high\ndistinction of a fusee, attested the importance of its proprietor. In\nevery other particular it was rather distinguished by signs of poverty\nthan of wealth. The domestic utensils were fewer in number and simpler\nin their forms, than those to be seen about the openings of the meanest\nlodges, nor was there a single one of those high-prized articles of\ncivilised life, which were occasionally bought of the traders, in\nbargains that bore so hard on the ignorant natives. All these had been\nbestowed, as they had been acquired, by the generous chief, on his\nsubordinates, to purchase an influence that might render him the master\nof their lives and persons; a species of wealth that was certainly more\nnoble in itself, and far dearer to his ambition.\n\nThe old man well knew this to be the lodge of Mahtoree, and, in\nobedience to the sign of the chief, he held his way towards it with slow\nand reluctant steps. But there were others present, who were equally\ninterested in the approaching conference, whose apprehensions were\nnot to be so easily suppressed. The watchful eye and jealous ears\nof Middleton had taught him enough to fill his soul with horrible\nforebodings. With an incredible effort he succeeded in gaining his feet,\nand called aloud to the retiring trapper--\n\n\"I conjure you, old man, if the love you bore my parents was more than\nwords, or if the love you bear your God is that of a Christian man,\nutter not a syllable that may wound the ear of that innocent--\"\n\nExhausted in spirit and fettered in limbs, he then fell, like an\ninanimate log, to the earth, where he lay like one dead.\n\nPaul had however caught the clue and completed the exhortation, in his\npeculiar manner.\n\n\"Harkee, old trapper,\" he shouted, vainly endeavouring at the same time\nto make a gesture of defiance with his hand; \"if you ar' about to play\nthe interpreter, speak such words to the ears of that damnable savage,\nas becomes a white man to use, and a heathen to hear. Tell him, from me,\nthat if he does or says the thing that is uncivil to the girl, called\nNelly Wade, that I'll curse him with my dying breath; that I'll pray\nfor all good Christians in Kentucky to curse him; sitting and standing;\neating and drinking, fighting, praying, or at horse-races; in-doors\nand outdoors; in summer or winter, or in the month of March in short\nI'll--ay, it ar' a fact, morally true--I'll haunt him, if the ghost of a\nPale-face can contrive to lift itself from a grave made by the hands of\na Red-skin!\"\n\nHaving thus ventured the most terrible denunciation he could devise, and\nthe one which, in the eyes of the honest bee-hunter, there seemed\nthe greatest likelihood of his being able to put in execution, he was\nobliged to await the fruits of his threat, with that resignation which\nwould be apt to govern a western border-man who, in addition to the\nprospects just named, had the advantage of contemplating them in fetters\nand bondage. We shall not detain the narrative, to relate the quaint\nmorals with which he next endeavoured to cheer the drooping spirits\nof his more sensitive companion, or the occasional pithy and peculiar\nbenedictions that he pronounced, on all the bands of the Dahcotahs,\ncommencing with those whom he accused of stealing or murdering, on the\nbanks of the distant Mississippi, and concluding, in terms of suitable\nenergy, with the Teton tribe. The latter more than once received from\nhis lips curses as sententious and as complicated as that celebrated\nanathema of the church, for a knowledge of which most unlettered\nProtestants are indebted to the pious researches of the worthy Tristram\nShandy. But as Middleton recovered from his exhaustion he was fain to\nappease the boisterous temper of his associate, by admonishing him of\nthe uselessness of such denunciations, and of the possibility of their\nhastening the very evil he deprecated, by irritating the resentments\nof a race, who were sufficiently fierce and lawless, even in their most\npacific moods.\n\nIn the mean time the trapper and the Sioux chief pursued their way to\nthe lodge. The former had watched with painful interest the expression\nof Mahtoree's eye, while the words of Middleton and Paul were pursuing\ntheir footsteps, but the mien of the Indian was far too much restrained\nand self-guarded, to permit the smallest of his emotions to escape\nthrough any of those ordinary outlets, by which the condition of the\nhuman volcano is commonly betrayed. His look was fastened on the little\nhabitation they approached; and, for the moment, his thoughts appeared\nto brood alone on the purposes of this extraordinary visit.\n\nThe appearance of the interior of the lodge corresponded with its\nexterior. It was larger than most of the others, more finished in its\nform, and finer in its materials; but there its superiority ceased.\nNothing could be more simple and republican than the form of living that\nthe ambitious and powerful Teton chose to exhibit to the eyes of his\npeople. A choice collection of weapons for the chase, some three or four\nmedals, bestowed by the traders and political agents of the Canadas as\na homage to, or rather as an acknowledgment of, his rank, with a few of\nthe most indispensable articles of personal accommodation, composed\nits furniture. It abounded in neither venison, nor the wild-beef of the\nprairies; its crafty owner having well understood that the liberality\nof a single individual would be abundantly rewarded by the daily\ncontributions of a band. Although as pre-eminent in the chase as in war,\na deer or a buffaloe was never seen to enter whole into his lodge. In\nreturn, an animal was rarely brought into the encampment, that did not\ncontribute to support the family of Mahtoree. But the policy of the\nchief seldom permitted more to remain than sufficed for the wants of the\nday, perfectly assured that all must suffer before hunger, the bane of\nsavage life, could lay its fell fangs on so important a victim.\n\nImmediately beneath the favourite bow of the chief, and encircled in a\nsort of magical ring of spears, shields, lances and arrows, all of which\nhad in their time done good service, was suspended the mysterious and\nsacred medicine-bag. It was highly-wrought in wampum, and profusely\nornamented with beads and porcupine's quills, after the most cunning\ndevices of Indian ingenuity. The peculiar freedom of Mahtoree's\nreligious creed has been more than once intimated, and by a singular\nspecies of contradiction, he appeared to have lavished his attentions\non this emblem of a supernatural agency, in a degree that was precisely\ninverse to his faith. It was merely the manner in which the Sioux\nimitated the well-known expedient of the Pharisees, \"in order that they\nmight be seen of men.\"\n\nThe tent had not, however, been entered by its owner since his return\nfrom the recent expedition. As the reader has already anticipated, it\nhad been made the prison of Inez and Ellen. The bride of Middleton was\nseated on a simple couch of sweet-scented herbs covered with skins.\nShe had already suffered so much, and witnessed so many wild and\nunlooked-for events, within the short space of her captivity, that every\nadditional misfortune fell with a diminished force on her seemingly\ndevoted head. Her cheeks were bloodless, her dark and usually animated\neye was contracted in an expression of settled concern, and her form\nappeared shrinking and sensitive, nearly to extinction. But in the midst\nof these evidences of natural weakness, there were at times such an air\nof pious resignation, such gleams of meek but holy hope lighting her\ncountenance, as might well have rendered it a question whether the\nhapless captive was most a subject of pity, or of admiration. All the\nprecepts of father Ignatius were riveted in her faithful memory, and\nnot a few of his pious visions were floating before her imagination.\nSustained by so sacred resolutions, the mild, the patient and the\nconfiding girl was bowing her head to this new stroke of Providence,\nwith the same sort of meekness as she would have submitted to any other\nprescribed penitence for her sins, though nature, at moments, warred\npowerfully, with so compelled a humility.\n\nOn the other hand, Ellen had exhibited far more of the woman, and\nconsequently of the passions of the world. She had wept until her eyes\nwere swollen and red. Her cheeks were flushed and angry, and her whole\nmien was distinguished by an air of spirit and resentment, that was not\na little, however, qualified by apprehensions for the future. In short,\nthere was that about the eye and step of the betrothed of Paul, which\ngave a warranty that should happier times arrive, and the constancy of\nthe bee-hunter finally meet with its reward, he would possess a\npartner every way worthy to cope with his own thoughtless and buoyant\ntemperament.\n\nThere was still another and a third figure in that little knot of\nfemales. It was the youngest, the most highly gifted, and, until now,\nthe most favoured of the wives of the Teton. Her charms had not been\nwithout the most powerful attraction in the eyes of her husband, until\nthey had so unexpectedly opened on the surpassing loveliness of a woman\nof the Pale-faces. From that hapless moment the graces, the attachment,\nthe fidelity of the young Indian, had lost their power to please. Still\nthe complexion of Tachechana, though less dazzling than that of her\nrival, was, for her race, clear and healthy. Her hazel eye had the\nsweetness and playfulness of the antelope's; her voice was soft and\njoyous as the song of the wren, and her happy laugh was the very melody\nof the forest. Of all the Sioux girls, Tachechana (or the Fawn) was\nthe lightest-hearted and the most envied. Her father had been a\ndistinguished brave, and her brothers had already left their bones on a\ndistant and dreary war-path. Numberless were the warriors, who had sent\npresents to the lodge of her parents, but none of them were listened to\nuntil a messenger from the great Mahtoree had come. She was his third\nwife, it is true, but she was confessedly the most favoured of them all.\nTheir union had existed but two short seasons, and its fruits now lay\nsleeping at her feet, wrapped in the customary ligatures of skin and\nbark, which form the swaddlings of an Indian infant.\n\nAt the moment, when Mahtoree and the trapper arrived at the opening of\nthe lodge, the young Sioux wife was seated on a simple stool, turning\nher soft eyes, with looks that varied, like her emotions, with love and\nwonder, from the unconscious child to those rare beings, who had\nfilled her youthful and uninstructed mind with so much admiration and\nastonishment. Though Inez and Ellen had passed an entire day in her\nsight, it seemed as if the longings of her curiosity were increasing\nwith each new gaze. She regarded them as beings of an entirely different\nnature and condition from the females of the prairie. Even the mystery\nof their complicated attire had its secret influence on her simple mind,\nthough it was the grace and charms of sex, to which nature has made\nevery people so sensible, that most attracted her admiration. But\nwhile her ingenuous disposition freely admitted the superiority of the\nstrangers over the less brilliant attractions of the Dahcotah maidens,\nshe had seen no reason to deprecate their advantages. The visit that she\nwas now about to receive, was the first which her husband had made\nto the tent since his return from the recent inroad, and he was ever\npresent to her thoughts, as a successful warrior, who was not ashamed,\nin the moments of inaction, to admit the softer feelings of a father and\na husband.\n\nWe have every where endeavoured to show that while Mahtoree was in all\nessentials a warrior of the prairies, he was much in advance of\nhis people in those acquirements which announce the dawnings of\ncivilisation. He had held frequent communion with the traders and troops\nof the Canadas, and the intercourse had unsettled many of those wild\nopinions which were his birthright, without perhaps substituting any\nothers of a nature sufficiently definite to be profitable. His reasoning\nwas rather subtle than true, and his philosophy far more audacious than\nprofound. Like thousands of more enlightened beings, who fancy they\nare able to go through the trials of human existence without any other\nsupport than their own resolutions, his morals were accommodating and\nhis motive selfish. These several characteristics will be understood\nalways with reference to the situation of the Indian, though little\napology is needed for finding resemblances between men, who essentially\npossess the same nature, however it may be modified by circumstances.\n\nNotwithstanding the presence of Inez and Ellen, the entrance of the\nTeton warrior into the lodge of his favourite wife, was made with the\ntread and mien of a master. The step of his moccasin was noiseless,\nbut the rattling of his bracelets, and of the silver ornaments of his\nleggings, sufficed to announce his approach, as he pushed aside the skin\ncovering of the opening of the tent, and stood in the presence of its\ninmates. A faint cry of pleasure burst from the lips of Tachechana in\nthe suddenness of her surprise, but the emotion was instantly suppressed\nin that subdued demeanour which should characterise a matron of her\ntribe. Instead of returning the stolen glance of his youthful and\nsecretly rejoicing wife, Mahtoree moved to the couch, occupied by his\nprisoners, and placed himself in the haughty, upright attitude of an\nIndian chief, before their eyes. The old man had glided past him, and\nalready taken a position suited to the office he had been commanded to\nfill.\n\nSurprise kept the females silent and nearly breathless. Though\naccustomed to the sight of savage warriors, in the horrid panoply of\ntheir terrible profession, there was something so startling in the\nentrance, and so audacious in the inexplicable look of their conqueror,\nthat the eyes of both sunk to the earth, under a feeling of terror and\nembarrassment. Then Inez recovered herself, and addressing the trapper,\nshe demanded, with the dignity of an offended gentlewoman, though with\nher accustomed grace, to what circumstance they owed this extraordinary\nand unexpected visit. The old man hesitated; but clearing his throat,\nlike one who was about to make an effort to which he was little used, he\nventured on the following reply--\n\n\"Lady,\" he said, \"a savage is a savage, and you are not to look for the\nuses and formalities of the settlements on a bleak and windy prairie.\nAs these Indians would say, fashions and courtesies are things so light,\nthat they would blow away. As for myself, though a man of the forest, I\nhave seen the ways of the great, in my time, and I am not to learn that\nthey differ from the ways of the lowly. I was long a serving-man in my\nyouth, not one of your beck-and-nod runners about a household, but a man\nthat went through the servitude of the forest with his officer, and well\ndo I know in what manner to approach the wife of a captain. Now, had I\nthe ordering of this visit, I would first have hemmed aloud at the door,\nin order that you might hear that strangers were coming, and then I--\"\n\n\"The manner is indifferent,\" interrupted Inez, too anxious to await the\nprolix explanations of the old man; \"why is the visit made?\"\n\n\"Therein shall the savage speak for himself. The daughters of the\nPale-faces wish to know why the Great Teton has come into his lodge?\"\n\nMahtoree regarded his interrogator with a surprise, which showed how\nextraordinary he deemed the question. Then placing himself in a posture\nof condescension, after a moment's delay, he answered--\n\n\"Sing in the ears of the dark-eye. Tell her the lodge of Mahtoree is\nvery large, and that it is not full. She shall find room in it, and none\nshall be greater than she. Tell the light-hair, that she too may stay in\nthe lodge of a brave, and eat of his venison. Mahtoree is a great chief.\nHis hand is never shut.\"\n\n\"Teton,\" returned the trapper, shaking his head in evidence of the\nstrong disapprobation with which he heard this language, \"the tongue of\na Red-skin must be coloured white, before it can make music in the ears\nof a Pale-face. Should your words be spoken, my daughters would shut\ntheir ears, and Mahtoree would seem a trader to their eyes. Now listen\nto what comes from a grey-head, and then speak accordingly. My people\nis a mighty people. The sun rises on their eastern and sets on their\nwestern border. The land is filled with bright-eyed and laughing girls,\nlike these you see--ay, Teton, I tell no lie,\" observing his auditor to\nstart with an air of distrust--\"bright-eyed and pleasant to behold, as\nthese before you.\"\n\n\"Has my father a hundred wives!\" interrupted the savage, laying his\nfinger on the shoulder of the trapper, with a look of curious interest\nin the reply.\n\n\"No, Dahcotah. The Master of Life has said to me, Live alone; your lodge\nshall be the forest; the roof of your wigwam, the clouds. But, though\nnever bound in the secret faith which, in my nation, ties one man to one\nwoman, often have I seen the workings of that kindness which brings\nthe two together. Go into the regions of my people; you will see the\ndaughters of the land, fluttering through the towns like many-coloured\nand joyful birds in the season of blossoms. You will meet them, singing\nand rejoicing, along the great paths of the country, and you will\nhear the woods ringing with their laughter. They are very excellent to\nbehold, and the young men find pleasure in looking at them.\"\n\n\"Hugh,\" ejaculated the attentive Mahtoree.\n\n\"Ay, well may you put faith in what you hear, for it is no lie. But when\na youth has found a maiden to please him, he speaks to her in a voice\nso soft, that none else can hear. He does not say, My lodge is empty and\nthere is room for another; but shall I build, and will the virgin show\nme near what spring she would dwell? His voice is sweeter than honey\nfrom the locust, and goes into the ear thrilling like the song of a\nwren. Therefore, if my brother wishes his words to be heard, he must\nspeak with a white tongue.\"\n\nMahtoree pondered deeply, and in a wonder that he did not attempt to\nconceal. It was reversing all the order of society, and, according to\nhis established opinions, endangering the dignity of a chief, for a\nwarrior thus to humble himself before a woman. But as Inez sat before\nhim, reserved and imposing in air, utterly unconscious of his object,\nand least of all suspecting the true purport of so extraordinary\na visit, the savage felt the influence of a manner to which he was\nunaccustomed. Bowing his head, in acknowledgment of his error, he\nstepped a little back, and placing himself in an attitude of easy\ndignity, he began to speak with the confidence of one who had been no\nless distinguished for eloquence, than for deeds in arms. Keeping his\neyes riveted on the unconscious bride of Middleton, he proceeded in the\nfollowing words--\n\n\"I am a man with a red skin, but my eyes are dark. They have been open\nsince many snows. They have seen many things--they know a brave from a\ncoward. When a boy, I saw nothing but the bison and the deer. I went to\nthe hunts, and I saw the cougar and the bear. This made Mahtoree a man.\nHe talked with his mother no more. His ears were open to the wisdom of\nthe old men. They told him every thing--they told him of the Big-knives.\nHe went on the war-path. He was then the last; now, he is the first.\nWhat Dahcotah dare say he will go before Mahtoree into the hunting\ngrounds of the Pawnees? The chiefs met him at their doors, and they\nsaid, My son is without a home. They gave him their lodges, they gave\nhim their riches, and they gave him their daughters. Then Mahtoree\nbecame a chief, as his fathers had been. He struck the warriors of\nall the nations, and he could have chosen wives from the Pawnees, the\nOmawhaws, and the Konzas; but he looked at the hunting grounds, and not\nat his village. He thought a horse was pleasanter than a Dahcotah girl.\nBut he found a flower on the prairies, and he plucked it, and brought it\ninto his lodge. He forgets that he is the master of a single horse. He\ngives them all to the stranger, for Mahtoree is not a thief; he will\nonly keep the flower he found on the prairie. Her feet are very tender.\nShe cannot walk to the door of her father; she will stay, in the lodge\nof a valiant warrior for ever.\"\n\nWhen he had finished this extraordinary address, the Teton awaited to\nhave it translated, with the air of a suitor who entertained no very\ndisheartening doubts of his success. The trapper had not lost a syllable\nof the speech, and he now prepared himself to render it into English in\nsuch a manner as should leave its principal idea even more obscure than\nin the original. But as his reluctant lips were in the act of parting,\nEllen lifted a finger, and with a keen glance from her quick eye, at the\nstill attentive Inez, she interrupted him.\n\n\"Spare your breath,\" she said, \"all that a savage says is not to be\nrepeated before a Christian lady.\"\n\nInez started, blushed, and bowed with an air of reserve, as she coldly\nthanked the old man for his intentions, and observed that she could now\nwish to be alone.\n\n\"My daughters have no need of ears to understand what a great Dahcotah\nsays,\" returned the trapper, addressing himself to the expecting\nMahtoree. \"The look he has given, and the signs he has made, are enough.\nThey understand him; they wish to think of his words; for the children\nof great braves, such as their fathers are, do nothing with out much\nthought.\"\n\nWith this explanation, so flattering to the energy of his eloquence, and\nso promising to his future hopes, the Teton was every way content.\nHe made the customary ejaculation of assent, and prepared to retire.\nSaluting the females, in the cold but dignified manner of his people,\nhe drew his robe about him, and moved from the spot where he had stood,\nwith an air of ill-concealed triumph.\n\nBut there had been a stricken, though a motionless and unobserved\nauditor of the foregoing scene. Not a syllable had fallen from the lips\nof the long and anxiously expected husband, that had not gone directly\nto the heart of his unoffending wife. In this manner had he wooed her\nfrom the lodge of her father, and it was to listen to similar pictures\nof the renown and deeds of the greatest brave in her tribe, that she had\nshut her ears to the tender tales of so many of the Sioux youths.\n\nAs the Teton turned to leave his lodge, in the manner just mentioned, he\nfound this unexpected and half-forgotten object before him. She stood,\nin the humble guise and with the shrinking air of an Indian girl,\nholding the pledge of their former love in her arms, directly in his\npath. Starting, the chief regained the marble-like indifference\nof countenance, which distinguished in so remarkable a degree the\nrestrained or more artificial expression of his features, and signed to\nher, with an air of authority to give place.\n\n\"Is not Tachechana the daughter of a chief?\" demanded a subdued voice,\nin which pride struggled with anguish: \"were not her brothers braves?\"\n\n\"Go; the men are calling their partisan. He has no ears for a woman.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the supplicant; \"it is not the voice of Tachechana that\nyou hear, but this boy, speaking with the tongue of his mother. He\nis the son of a chief, and his words will go up to his father's ears.\nListen to what he says. When was Mahtoree hungry and Tachechana had\nnot food for him? When did he go on the path of the Pawnees and find it\nempty, that my mother did not weep? When did he come back with the marks\nof their blows, that she did not sing? What Sioux girl has given a brave\na son like me? Look at me well, that you may know me. My eyes are the\neagle's. I look at the sun and laugh. In a little time the Dahcotahs\nwill follow me to the hunts and on the war-path. Why does my father turn\nhis eyes from the woman that gives me milk? Why has he so soon forgotten\nthe daughter of a mighty Sioux?\"\n\nThere was a single instant, as the exulting father suffered his cold eye\nto wander to the face of the laughing boy, that the stern nature of the\nTeton seemed touched. But shaking off the grateful sentiment, like one\nwho would gladly be rid of any painful, because reproachful, emotion,\nhe laid his hand calmly on the arm of his wife, and led her directly in\nfront of Inez. Pointing to the sweet countenance that was beaming on her\nown, with a look of tenderness and commiseration, he paused, to allow\nhis wife to contemplate a loveliness, which was quite as excellent to\nher ingenuous mind as it had proved dangerous to the character of her\nfaithless husband. When he thought abundant time had passed to make the\ncontrast sufficiently striking, he suddenly raised a small mirror, that\ndangled at her breast, an ornament he had himself bestowed, in an hour\nof fondness, as a compliment to her beauty, and placed her own dark\nimage in its place. Wrapping his robe again about him, the Teton\nmotioned to the trapper to follow, and stalked haughtily from the lodge,\nmuttering, as he went--\n\n\"Mahtoree is very wise! What nation has so great a chief as the\nDahcotahs?\"\n\nTachechana stood frozen into a statue of humility. Her mild and usually\njoyous countenance worked, as if the struggle within was about to\ndissolve the connection between her soul and that more material part,\nwhose deformity was becoming so loathsome. Inez and Ellen were utterly\nignorant of the nature of her interview with her husband, though the\nquick and sharpened wits of the latter led her to suspect a truth, to\nwhich the entire innocence of the former furnished no clue. They were\nboth, however, about to tender those sympathies, which are so natural\nto, and so graceful in the sex, when their necessity seemed suddenly to\ncease. The convulsions in the features of the young Sioux disappeared,\nand her countenance became cold and rigid, like chiselled stone. A\nsingle expression of subdued anguish, which had made its impression on\na brow that had rarely before contracted with sorrow, alone remained. It\nwas never removed, in all the changes of seasons, fortunes, and years,\nwhich, in the vicissitudes of a suffering, female, savage life, she was\nsubsequently doomed to endure. As in the case of a premature blight, let\nthe plant quicken and revive as it may, the effects of that withering\ntouch were always present.\n\nTachechana first stripped her person of every vestige of those rude but\nhighly prized ornaments, which the liberality of her husband had been\nwont to lavish on her, and she tendered them meekly, and without a\nmurmur, as an offering to the superiority of Inez. The bracelets\nwere forced from her wrists, the complicated mazes of beads from her\nleggings, and the broad silver band from her brow. Then she paused,\nlong and painfully. But it would seem, that the resolution, she had\nonce adopted, was not to be conquered by the lingering emotions of any\naffection, however natural. The boy himself was next laid at the feet\nof her supposed rival, and well might the self-abased wife of the Teton\nbelieve that the burden of her sacrifice was now full.\n\nWhile Inez and Ellen stood regarding these several strange movements\nwith eyes of wonder, a low soft musical voice was heard saying in a\nlanguage, that to them was unintelligible--\n\n\"A strange tongue will tell my boy the manner to become a man. He will\nhear sounds that are new, but he will learn them, and forget the voice\nof his mother. It is the will of the Wahcondah, and a Sioux girl should\nnot complain. Speak to him softly, for his ears are very little; when he\nis big, your words may be louder. Let him not be a girl, for very sad is\nthe life of a woman. Teach him to keep his eyes on the men. Show him\nhow to strike them that do him wrong, and let him never forget to return\nblow for blow. When he goes to hunt, the flower of the Pale-faces,\" she\nconcluded, using in bitterness the metaphor which had been supplied by\nthe imagination of her truant husband, \"will whisper softly in his ears\nthat the skin of his mother was red, and that she was once the Fawn of\nthe Dahcotahs.\"\n\nTachechana pressed a kiss on the lips of her son, and withdrew to the\nfarther side of the lodge. Here she drew her light calico robe over her\nhead, and took her seat, in token of humility, on the naked earth. All\nefforts, to attract her attention, were fruitless. She neither heard\nremonstrances, nor felt the touch. Once or twice her voice rose, in a\nsort of wailing song, from beneath her quivering mantle, but it never\nmounted into the wildness of savage music. In this manner she remained\nunseen for hours, while events were occurring without the lodge, which\nnot only materially changed the complexion of her own fortunes, but left\na lasting and deep impression on the future movements of the wandering\nSioux.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n  I'll no swaggerers: I am in good name and fame with the very best:\n  --shut the door;--there come no swaggerers here: I have not lived\n  all this while, to have swaggering now: shut the door, I pray you.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nMahtoree encountered, at the door of his lodge, Ishmael, Abiram,\nand Esther. The first glance of his eye, at the countenance of the\nheavy-moulded squatter, served to tell the cunning Teton, that the\ntreacherous truce he had made, with these dupes of his superior\nsagacity, was in some danger of a violent termination.\n\n\"Look you here, old grey-beard,\" said Ishmael, seizing the trapper, and\nwhirling him round as if he had been a top; \"that I am tired of carrying\non a discourse with fingers and thumbs, instead of a tongue, ar' a\nnatural fact; so you'll play linguister and put my words into Indian,\nwithout much caring whether they suit the stomach of a Red-skin or not.\"\n\n\"Say on, friend,\" calmly returned the trapper; \"they shall be given as\nplainly as you send them.\"\n\n\"Friend!\" repeated the squatter, eyeing the other for an instant, with\nan expression of indefinable meaning. \"But it is no more than a word,\nand sounds break no bones, and survey no farms. Tell this thieving\nSioux, then, that I come to claim the conditions of our solemn bargain,\nmade at the foot of the rock.\"\n\nWhen the trapper had rendered his meaning into the Sioux language,\nMahtoree demanded, with an air of surprise--\n\n\"Is my brother cold? buffaloe skins are plenty. Is he hungry? Let my\nyoung men carry venison into his lodges.\"\n\nThe squatter elevated his clenched fist in a menacing manner, and struck\nit with violence on the palm of his open hand, by way of confirming his\ndetermination, as he answered--\n\n\"Tell the deceitful liar, I have not come like a beggar to pick his\nbones, but like a freeman asking for his own; and have it I will. And,\nmoreover, tell him I claim that you, too, miserable sinner as you ar',\nshould be given up to justice. There's no mistake. My prisoner, my\nniece, and you. I demand the three at his hands, according to a sworn\nagreement.\"\n\nThe immovable old man smiled, with an expression of singular\nintelligence, as he answered--\n\n\"Friend squatter, you ask what few men would be willing to grant. You\nwould first cut the tongue from the mouth of the Teton, and then the heart\nfrom his bosom.\"\n\n\"It is little that Ishmael Bush regards, who or what is damaged in\nclaiming his own. But put you the questions in straight-going Indian,\nand when you speak of yourself, make such a sign as a white man will\nunderstand, in order that I may know there is no foul play.\"\n\nThe trapper laughed in his silent fashion, and muttered a few words to\nhimself before he addressed the chief--\n\n\"Let the Dahcotah open his ears very wide,\" he said 'that big words may\nhave room to enter. His friend the Big-knife comes with an empty hand,\nand he says that the Teton must fill it.\"\n\n\"Wagh! Mahtoree is a rich chief. He is master of the prairies.\"\n\n\"He must give the dark-hair.\"\n\nThe brow of the chief contracted in an ominous frown, that threatened\ninstant destruction to the audacious squatter; but as suddenly\nrecollecting his policy, he craftily replied--\n\n\"A girl is too light for the hand of such a brave. I will fill it with\nbuffaloes.\"\n\n\"He says he has need of the light-hair, too; who has his blood in her\nveins.\"\n\n\"She shall be the wife of Mahtoree; then the Long-knife will be the\nfather of a chief.\"\n\n\"And me,\" continued the trapper, making one of those expressive signs,\nby which the natives communicate, with nearly the same facility as with\ntheir tongues, and turning to the squatter at the same time, in order\nthat the latter might see he dealt fairly by him; \"he asks for a\nmiserable and worn-out trapper.\"\n\nThe Dahcotah threw his arm over the shoulder of the old man, with an air\nof great affection, before he replied to this third and last demand.\n\n\"My friend is old,\" he said, \"and cannot travel far. He will stay with\nthe Tetons, that they may learn wisdom from his words. What Sioux has a\ntongue like my father? No; let his words be very soft, but let them be\nvery clear. Mahtoree will give skins and buffaloes. He will give the\nyoung men of the Pale-faces wives, but he cannot give away any who live\nin his own lodge.\"\n\nPerfectly satisfied, himself, with this laconic reply, the chief was\nmoving towards his expecting counsellors, when suddenly returning, he\ninterrupted the translation of the trapper by adding--\n\n\"Tell the Great Buffaloe\" (a name by which the Tetons had already\nchristened Ishmael), \"that Mahtoree has a hand which is always open.\nSee,\" he added, pointing to the hard and wrinkled visage of the\nattentive Esther, \"his wife is too old, for so great a chief. Let him\nput her out of his lodge. Mahtoree loves him as a brother. He is his\nbrother. He shall have the youngest wife of the Teton. Tachechana, the\npride of the Sioux girls, shall cook his venison, and many braves will\nlook at him with longing minds. Go, a Dahcotah is generous.\"\n\nThe singular coolness, with which the Teton concluded this audacious\nproposal, confounded even the practised trapper. He stared after the\nretiring form of the Indian, with an astonishment he did not care to\nconceal, nor did he renew his attempt at interpretation until the\nperson of Mahtoree was blended with the cluster of warriors, who had so\nlong, and with so characteristic patience, awaited his return.\n\n\"The Teton chief has spoken very plainly,\" the old man continued; \"he\nwill not give you the lady, to whom the Lord in heaven knows you have no\nclaim, unless it be such as the wolf has to the lamb. He will not give\nyou the child, you call your niece; and therein I acknowledge that I\nam far from certain he has the same justice on his side. Moreover,\nneighbour squatter, he flatly denies your demand for me, miserable and\nworthless as I am; nor do I think he has been unwise in so doing, seeing\nthat I should have many reasons against journeying far in your company.\nBut he makes you an offer, which it is right and convenient you should\nknow. The Teton says through me, who am no more than a mouthpiece, and\ntherein not answerable for the sin of his words, but he says, as this\ngood woman is getting past the comely age, it is reasonable for you\nto tire of such a wife. He therefore tells you to turn her out of your\nlodge, and when it is empty, he will send his own favourite, or rather\nshe that was his favourite, the 'Skipping Fawn,' as the Siouxes call\nher, to fill her place. You see, neighbour, though the Red-skin is\nminded to keep your property, he is willing to give you wherewithal to\nmake yourself some return!\"\n\nIshmael listened to these replies, to his several demands, with that\nspecies of gathering indignation, with which the dullest tempers mount\ninto the most violent paroxysms of rage. He even affected to laugh at\nthe conceit of exchanging his long-tried partner for the more flexible\nsupport of the youthful Tachechana, though his voice was hollow and\nunnatural in the effort. But Esther was far from giving the proposal so\nfacetious a reception. Lifting her voice to its most audible key, she\nbroke forth, after catching her breath like one who had been in some\nimminent danger of strangulation, as follows--\n\n\"Hoity-toity; who set an Indian up for a maker and breaker of the rights\nof wedded wives! Does he think a woman is a beast of the prairie, that\nshe is to be chased from a village, by dog and gun. Let the bravest\nsquaw of them all come forth and boast of her doings; can she show such\na brood as mine? A wicked tyrant is that thieving Red-skin, and a bold\nrogue I warrant me. He would be captain in-doors, as well as out!\nAn honest woman is no better in his eyes than one of your broomstick\njumpers. And you, Ishmael Bush, the father of seven sons and so many\ncomely daughters, to open your sinful mouth, except to curse him! Would\nye disgrace colour, and family, and nation, by mixing white blood with\nred, and would ye be the parent of a race of mules! The devil has often\ntempted you, my man, but never before has he set so cunning a snare as\nthis. Go back among your children, friend; go, and remember that you are\nnot a prowling bear, but a Christian man, and thank God that you ar' a\nlawful husband!\"\n\nThe clamour of Esther was anticipated by the judicious trapper. He had\neasily foreseen that her meek temper would overflow at so scandalous a\nproposal as repudiation, and he now profited by the tempest, to retire\nto a place where he was at least safe from any immediate violence on the\npart of her less excited, but certainly more dangerous husband. Ishmael,\nwho had made his demands with a stout determination to enforce them, was\ndiverted by the windy torrent, like many a more obstinate husband, from\nhis purpose, and in order to appease a jealousy that resembled the fury\nwith which the bear defends her cubs, was fain to retire to a distance\nfrom the lodge, that was known to contain the unoffending object of the\nsudden uproar.\n\n\"Let your copper-coloured minx come forth, and show her tawney beauty\nbefore the face of a woman who has heard more than one church bell, and\nseen a power of real quality,\" cried Esther, flourishing her hand in\ntriumph, as she drove Ishmael and Abiram before her, like two truant\nboys, towards their own encampment. \"I warrant me, I warrant me, here is\none who would shortly talk her down! Never think to tarry here, my men;\nnever think to shut an eye in a camp, through which the devil walks as\nopenly as if he were a gentleman, and sure of his welcome. Here, you\nAbner, Enoch, Jesse, where ar' ye gotten to? Put to, put to; if that\nweak-minded, soft-feeling man, your father, eats or drinks again in\nthis neighbourhood, we shall see him poisoned with the craft of the\nRed-skins. Not that I care, I, who comes into my place, when it is once\nlawfully empty; but, Ishmael, I never thought that you, who have had one\nwoman with a white skin, would find pleasure in looking on a brazen--ay,\nthat she is copper ar' a fact; you can't deny it, and I warrant me,\nbrazen enough is she too!\"\n\nAgainst this ebullition of wounded female pride, the experienced husband\nmade no other head, than by an occasional exclamation, which he intended\nto be precursor of a simple asseveration of his own innocence. The fury\nof the woman would not be appeased. She listened to nothing but her own\nvoice, and consequently nothing was heard but her mandates to depart.\n\nThe squatter had collected his beasts and loaded his wagons, as\na measure of precaution, before proceeding to the extremity he\ncontemplated. Esther consequently found every thing favourable to\nher wishes. The young men stared at each other, as they witnessed the\nextraordinary excitement of their mother, but took little interest in\nan event which, in the course of their experience, had found so many\nparallels. By command of their father, the tents were thrown into the\nvehicles, as a sort of reprisal for the want of faith in their late\nally, and then the train left the spot, in its usual listless and\nsluggish order.\n\nAs a formidable division of well-armed borderers protected the rear of\nthe retiring party, the Siouxes saw it depart without manifesting the\nsmallest evidence of surprise or resentment. The savage, like the tiger,\nrarely makes his attack on an enemy who expects him; and if the warriors\nof the Tetons meditated any hostility, it was in the still and patient\nmanner with which the feline beasts watch for the incautious moment, in\norder to ensure the blow. The counsels of Mahtoree, however, on whom so\nmuch of the policy of his people depended, lay deep in the depository of\nhis own thoughts. Perhaps he rejoiced at so easy a manner of getting rid\nof claims so troublesome; perhaps he awaited a fitting time to exhibit\nhis power; or it even might be, that matters of so much greater\nimportance were pressing on his mind, that it had not leisure to devote\nany of its faculties to an event of so much indifference.\n\nBut it would seem that while Ishmael made such a concession to the\nawakened feelings of Esther, he was far from abandoning his original\nintentions. His train followed the course of the river for a mile, and\nthen it came to a halt on the brow of the elevated land, and in a place\nwhich afforded the necessary facilities. Here he again pitched his\ntents, unharnessed his teams, sent his cattle on the bottom, and, in\nshort, made all the customary preparations to pass the night, with the\nsame coolness and deliberation as if he had not hurled an irritating\ndefiance into the teeth of his dangerous neighbours.\n\nIn the mean time the Tetons proceeded to the more regular business of\nthe hour. A fierce and savage joy had existed in the camp, from the\ninstant when it had been announced that their own chief was returning\nwith the long-dreaded and hated partisan of their enemies. For many\nhours the crones of the tribe had been going from lodge to lodge, in\norder to stimulate the tempers of the warriors to such a pass, as might\nleave but little room for mercy. To one they spoke of a son, whose scalp\nwas drying in the smoke of a Pawnee lodge. To another, they enumerated\nhis own scars, his disgraces, and defeats; with a third, they dwelt on\nhis losses of skins and horses; and a fourth was reminded of vengeance\nby a significant question, concerning some flagrant adventure, in which\nhe was known to have been a sufferer.\n\nBy these means the men had been so far excited as to have assembled, in\nthe manner already related, though it still remained a matter of doubt\nhow far they intended to carry their revenge. A variety of opinions\nprevailed on the policy of executing their prisoners; and Mahtoree had\nsuspended the discussions, in order to ascertain how far the measure\nmight propitiate, or retard, his own particular views. Hitherto the\nconsultations had merely been preliminary, with a design that each chief\nmight discover the number of supporters his particular views would be\nlikely to obtain, when the important subject should come before a more\nsolemn council of the tribe. The moment for the latter had now arrived,\nand the preparations were made with a dignity and solemnity suited to\nthe momentous interests of the occasion.\n\nWith a refinement in cruelty, that none but an Indian would have\nimagined, the place, selected for this grave deliberation, was\nimmediately about the post to which the most important of its subjects\nwas attached. Middleton and Paul were brought in their bonds, and laid\nat the feet of the Pawnee; then the men began to take their places,\naccording to their several claims to distinction. As warrior after\nwarrior approached, he seated himself in the wide circle, with a mien as\ncomposed and thoughtful, as if his mind were actually in a condition to\ndeal out justice, tempered, as it should be, with the heavenly quality\nof mercy. A place was reserved for three or four of the principal\nchiefs, and a few of the oldest of the women, as withered, as age,\nexposure, hardships, and lives of savage passions could make them,\nthrust themselves into the foremost circle, with a temerity, to which\nthey were impelled by their insatiable desire for cruelty, and which\nnothing, but their years and their long tried fidelity to the nation,\nwould have excused.\n\nAll, but the chiefs already named, were now in their places. These had\ndelayed their appearance, in the vain hope that their own unanimity\nmight smooth the way to that of their respective factions; for,\nnotwithstanding the superior influence of Mahtoree, his power was to be\nmaintained only by constant appeals to the opinions of his inferiors. As\nthese important personages at length entered the circle in a body,\ntheir sullen looks and clouded brows, notwithstanding the time given to\nconsultation, sufficiently proclaimed the discontent which reigned among\nthem. The eye of Mahtoree was varying in its expression, from sudden\ngleams, that seemed to kindle with the burning impulses of his soul, to\nthat cold and guarded steadiness, which was thought more peculiarly to\nbecome a chief in council. He took his seat, with the studied simplicity\nof a demagogue; though the keen and flashing glance, that he immediately\nthrew around the silent assembly, betrayed the more predominant temper\nof a tyrant.\n\nWhen all were present, an aged warrior lighted the great pipe of his\npeople, and blew the smoke towards the four quarters of the heavens. So\nsoon as this propitiatory offering was made, he tendered it to Mahtoree,\nwho, in affected humility, passed it to a grey-headed chief by his side.\nAfter the influence of the soothing weed had been courted by all, a\ngrave silence succeeded, as if each was not only qualified to, but\nactually did, think more deeply on the matters before them. Then an old\nIndian arose, and spoke as follows:--\n\n\"The eagle, at the falls of the endless river, was in its egg, many\nsnows after my hand had struck a Pawnee. What my tongue says, my eyes\nhave seen. Bohrecheena is very old. The hills have stood longer in their\nplaces, than he has been in his tribe, and the rivers were full and\nempty, before he was born; but where is the Sioux that knows it besides\nhimself? What he says, they will hear. If any of his words fall to the\nground, they will pick them up and hold them to their ears. If any blow\naway in the wind, my young men, who are very nimble, will catch them.\nNow listen. Since water ran and trees grew, the Sioux has found the\nPawnee on his war-path. As the cougar loves the antelope, the Dahcotah\nloves his enemy. When the wolf finds the fawn, does he lie down and\nsleep? When the panther sees the doe at the spring, does he shut his\neyes? You know that he does not. He drinks too; but it is of blood! A\nSioux is a leaping panther, a Pawnee a trembling deer. Let my children\nhear me. They will find my words good. I have spoken.\"\n\nA deep guttural exclamation of assent broke from the lips of all the\npartisans of Mahtoree, as they listened to this sanguinary advice from\none, who was certainly among the most aged men of the nation. That\ndeeply seated love of vengeance, which formed so prominent a feature in\ntheir characters, was gratified by his metaphorical allusions, and the\nchief himself augured favourably of the success of his own schemes, by\nthe number of supporters, who manifested themselves to be in favour of\nthe counsels of his friend. But still unanimity was far from prevailing.\nA long and decorous pause was suffered to succeed the words of the first\nspeaker, in order that all might duly deliberate on their wisdom, before\nanother chief took on himself the office of refutation. The second\norator, though past the prime of his days, was far less aged than the\none who had preceded him. He felt the disadvantage of this circumstance,\nand endeavoured to counteract it, as far as possible, by the excess of\nhis humility.\n\n\"I am but an infant,\" he commenced, looking furtively around him, in\norder to detect how far his well-established character for prudence and\ncourage contradicted his assertion. \"I have lived with the women, since\nmy father has been a man. If my head is getting grey, it is not because\nI am old. Some of the snow, which fell on it while I have been sleeping\non the war-paths, has frozen there, and the hot sun, near the Osage\nvillages, has not been strong enough to melt it.\" A low murmur was\nheard, expressive of admiration of the services to which he thus\nartfully alluded. The orator modestly awaited for the feeling to subside\na little, and then he continued, with increasing energy, encouraged by\ntheir commendations. \"But the eyes of a young brave are good. He can see\nvery far. He is a lynx. Look at me well. I will turn my back, that you\nmay see both sides of me. Now do you know I am your friend, for you look\non a part that a Pawnee never yet saw. Now look at my face; not in this\nseam, for there your eyes can never see into my spirit. It is a hole cut\nby a Konza. But here is an opening made by the Wahcondah, through which\nyou may look into the soul. What am I? A Dahcotah, within and without.\nYou know it. Therefore hear me. The blood of every creature on the\nprairie is red. Who can tell the spot where a Pawnee was struck, from\nthe place where my young men took a bison? It is of the same colour. The\nMaster of Life made them for each other. He made them alike. But will\nthe grass grow green where a Pale-face is killed? My young men must not\nthink that nation so numerous, that it will not miss a warrior. They\ncall them over often, and say, Where are my sons? If they miss one, they\nwill send into the prairies to look for him. If they cannot find him,\nthey will tell their runners to ask for him, among the Siouxes. My\nbrethren, the Big-knives are not fools. There is a mighty medicine of\ntheir nation now among us; who can tell how loud is his voice, or how\nlong is his arm?--\"\n\nThe speech of the orator, who was beginning to enter into his subject\nwith warmth, was cut short by the impatient Mahtoree, who suddenly arose\nand exclaimed, in a voice in which authority was mingled with contempt,\nand at the close with a keen tone of irony, also--\n\n\"Let my young men lead the evil spirit of the Palefaces to the council.\nMy brother shall see his medicine, face to face!\"\n\nA death-like and solemn stillness succeeded this extraordinary\ninterruption. It not only involved a deep offence against the sacred\ncourtesy of debate, but the mandate was likely to brave the unknown\npower of one of those incomprehensible beings, whom few Indians were\nenlightened enough, at that day, to regard without reverence, or few\nhardy enough to oppose. The subordinates, however, obeyed, and Obed was\nled forth from the lodge, mounted on Asinus, with a ceremony and state\nwhich was certainly intended for derision, but which nevertheless was\ngreatly enhanced by fear. As they entered the ring, Mahtoree, who had\nforeseen and had endeavoured to anticipate the influence of the Doctor,\nby bringing him into contempt, cast an eye around the assembly, in\norder to gather his success in the various dark visages by which he was\nencircled.\n\nTruly, nature and art had combined to produce such an effect from the\nair and appointments of the naturalist, as might have made him the\nsubject of wonder in any place. His head had been industriously shaved,\nafter the most approved fashion of Sioux taste. A gallant scalp-lock,\nwhich would probably not have been spared had the Doctor himself been\nconsulted in the matter, was all that remained of an exuberant, and at\nthat particular season of the year, far from uncomfortable head of\nhair. Thick coats of paint had been laid on the naked poll, and certain\nfanciful designs, in the same material, had even been extended into the\nneighbourhood of the eyes and mouth, lending to the keen expression\nof the former a look of twinkling cunning, and to the dogmatism of\nthe latter, not a little of the grimness of necromancy. He had been\ndespoiled of his upper garments, and, in their stead, his body was\nsufficiently protected from the cold, by a fantastically painted robe of\ndressed deer-skin. As if in mockery of his pursuit, sundry toads, frogs,\nlizards, butterflies, &c., all duly prepared to take their places\nat some future day, in his own private cabinet, were attached to the\nsolitary lock on his head, to his ears, and to various other conspicuous\nparts of his person. If, in addition to the effect produced by these\nquaint auxiliaries to his costume, we add the portentous and troubled\ngleamings of doubt, which rendered his visage doubly austere, and\nproclaimed the misgivings of the worthy Obed's mind, as he beheld his\npersonal dignity thus prostrated, and what was of far greater moment in\nhis eyes, himself led forth, as he firmly believed, to be the victim of\nsome heathenish sacrifice, the reader will find no difficulty in giving\ncredit to the sensation of awe, that was excited by his appearance in a\nband already more than half-prepared to worship him, as a powerful agent\nof the evil spirit.\n\nWeucha led Asinus directly into the centre of the circle, and leaving\nthem together, (for the legs of the naturalist were attached to the\nbeast in such a manner, that the two animals might be said to be\nincorporated, and to form a new order,) he withdrew to his proper place,\ngazing at the conjuror, as he retired, with a wonder and admiration,\nthat were natural to the groveling dulness of his mind.\n\nThe astonishment seemed mutual, between the spectators and the subject\nof this strange exhibition. If the Tetons contemplated the mysterious\nattributes of the medicine, with awe and fear, the Doctor gazed on every\nside of him, with a mixture of quite as many extraordinary emotions,\nin which the latter sensation, however, formed no inconsiderable\ningredient. Every where his eyes, which just at that moment possessed a\nsecret magnifying quality, seemed to rest on several dark, savage, and\nobdurate countenances at once, from none of which could he extract a\nsolitary gleam of sympathy or commiseration. At length his wandering\ngaze fell on the grave and decent features of the trapper, who, with\nHector at his feet, stood in the edge of the circle, leaning on that\nrifle which he had been permitted, as an acknowledged friend, to resume,\nand apparently musing on the events that were likely to succeed a\ncouncil, marked by so many and such striking ceremonies.\n\n\"Venerable venator, or hunter, or trapper,\" said the disconsolate Obed,\n\"I rejoice greatly in meeting thee again. I fear that the precious time,\nwhich had been allotted me, in order to complete a mighty labour, is\ndrawing to a premature close, and I would gladly unburden my mind to one\nwho, if not a pupil of science, has at least some of the knowledge which\ncivilisation imparts to its meanest subjects. Doubtless many and earnest\nenquiries will be made after my fate, by the learned societies of the\nworld, and perhaps expeditions will be sent into these regions to remove\nany doubts, which may arise on so important a subject. I esteem myself\nhappy that a man, who speaks the vernacular, is present, to preserve\nthe record of my end. You will say that after a well-spent and glorious\nlife, I died a martyr to science, and a victim to mental darkness. As I\nexpect to be particularly calm and abstracted in my last moments, if you\nadd a few details, concerning the fortitude and scholastic dignity with\nwhich I met my death, it may serve to encourage future aspirants for\nsimilar honours, and assuredly give offence to no one. And now, friend\ntrapper, as a duty I owe to human nature, I will conclude by demanding\nif all hope has deserted me, or if any means still exist by which so\nmuch valuable information may be rescued from the grasp of ignorance,\nand preserved to the pages of natural history.\"\n\nThe old man lent an attentive ear to this melancholy appeal, and\napparently he reflected on every side of the important question, before\nhe would presume to answer.\n\n\"I take it, friend physicianer,\" he at length gravely replied, \"that the\nchances of life and death, in your particular case, depend altogether on\nthe will of Providence, as it may be pleased to manifest it, through\nthe accursed windings of Indian cunning. For my own part, I see no great\ndifference in the main end to be gained, inasmuch as it can matter no\none greatly, yourself excepted, whether you live or die.\"\n\n\"Would you account the fall of a corner-stone, from the foundations of\nthe edifice of learning, a matter of indifference to contemporaries\nor to posterity?\" interrupted Obed. \"Besides, my aged associate,\" he\nreproachfully added, \"the interest, that a man has in his own existence,\nis by no means trifling, however it may be eclipsed by his devotion to\nmore general and philanthropic feelings.\"\n\n\"What I would say is this,\" resumed the trapper, who was far from\nunderstanding all the subtle distinctions with which his more learned\ncompanion so often saw fit to embellish his discourse; \"there is but one\nbirth and one death to all things, be it hound, or be it deer; be it\nred skin, or be it white. Both are in the hands of the Lord, it being as\nunlawful for man to strive to hasten the one, as impossible to prevent\nthe other. But I will not say that something may not be done to put the\nlast moment aside, for a while at least, and therefore it is a question,\nthat any one has a right to put to his own wisdom, how far he will go,\nand how much pain he will suffer, to lengthen out a time that may have\nbeen too long already. Many a dreary winter and scorching summer has\ngone by since I have turned, to the right hand or to the left, to add an\nhour to a life that has already stretched beyond fourscore years. I keep\nmyself as ready to answer to my name as a soldier at evening roll-call.\nIn my judgment, if your cases are left to Indian tempers, the policy of\nthe Great Sioux will lead his people to sacrifice you all; nor do I\nput much dependence on his seeming love for me; therefore it becomes a\nquestion whether you are ready for such a journey; and if, being ready,\nwhether this is not as good a time to start as another. Should my\nopinion be asked, thus far will I give it in your favour; that is to\nsay, it is my belief your life has been innocent enough, touching any\ngreat offences that you may have committed, though honesty compels me to\nadd, that I think all you can lay claim to, on the score of activity in\ndeeds, will not amount to any thing worth naming in the great account.\"\n\nObed turned a rueful eye on the calm, philosophic countenance of the\nother, as he answered with so discouraging a statement of his case,\nclearing his throat, as he did so, in order to conceal the desperate\nconcern which began to beset his faculties, with a vestige of that\npride, which rarely deserts poor human nature, even in the greatest\nemergencies.\n\n\"I believe, venerable hunter,\" he replied, \"considering the question in\nall its bearings, and assuming that your theory is just, it will be the\nsafest to conclude that I am not prepared to make so hasty a departure,\nand that measures of precaution should be, forthwith, resorted to.\"\n\n\"Being in that mind,\" returned the deliberate trapper, \"I will act for\nyou as I would for myself; though as time has begun to roll down the\nhill with you, I will just advise that you look to your case speedily,\nfor it may so happen that your name will be heard, when quite as little\nprepared to answer to it as now.\"\n\nWith this amicable understanding, the old man drew back again into the\nring, where he stood musing on the course he should now adopt, with the\nsingular mixture of decision and resignation that proceeded from his\nhabits and his humility, and which united to form a character, in\nwhich excessive energy, and the most meek submission to the will of\nProvidence, were oddly enough combined.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n  The witch, in Smithfield, shall be burned to ashes, And you three\n  shall be strangled on the gallows.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nThe Siouxes had awaited the issue of the foregoing dialogue with\ncommendable patience. Most of the band were restrained, by the secret\nawe with which they regarded the mysterious character of Obed; while a\nfew of the more intelligent chiefs gladly profited by the opportunity,\nto arrange their thoughts for the struggle that was plainly foreseen.\nMahtoree, influenced by neither of these feelings, was content to show\nthe trapper how much he conceded to his pleasure; and when the old man\ndiscontinued the discourse, he received from the chief a glance, that\nwas intended to remind him of the patience, with which he had awaited\nhis movements. A profound and motionless silence succeeded the short\ninterruption. Then Mahtoree arose, evidently prepared to speak. First\nplacing himself in an attitude of dignity, he turned a steady and severe\nlook on the whole assembly. The expression of his eye, however, changed\nas it glanced across the different countenances of his supporters and\nof his opponents. To the former the look, though stern, was not\nthreatening, while it seemed to tell the latter all the hazards they\nincurred, in daring to brave the resentment of one so powerful.\n\nStill, in the midst of so much hauteur and confidence, the sagacity\nand cunning of the Teton did not desert him. When he had thrown the\ngauntlet, as it were, to the whole tribe, and sufficiently asserted\nhis claim to superiority, his mien became more affable and his eye\nless angry. Then it was that he raised his voice, in the midst of a\ndeath-like stillness, varying its tones to suit the changing character\nof his images, and of his eloquence.\n\n\"What is a Sioux?\" the chief sagaciously began; \"he is ruler of the\nprairies, and master of its beasts. The fishes in the 'river of troubled\nwaters' know him, and come at his call. He is a fox in counsel; an eagle\nin sight; a grizzly bear in combat. A Dahcotah is a man!\" After waiting\nfor the low murmur of approbation, which followed this flattering\nportrait of his people, to subside, the Teton continued--\"What is a\nPawnee? A thief, who only steals from women; a Red-skin, who is not\nbrave; a hunter, that begs for his venison. In counsel he is a squirrel,\nhopping from place to place; he is an owl, that goes on the prairies\nat night; in battle he is an elk, whose legs are long. A Pawnee is a\nwoman.\" Another pause succeeded, during which a yell of delight broke\nfrom several mouths, and a demand was made, that the taunting words\nshould be translated to the unconscious subject of their biting\ncontempt. The old man took his cue from the eyes of Mahtoree, and\ncomplied. Hard-Heart listened gravely, and then, as if apprized that his\ntime to speak had not arrived, he once more bent his look on the\nvacant air. The orator watched his countenance, with an expression that\nmanifested how inextinguishable was the hatred he felt for the only\nchief, far and near, whose fame might advantageously be compared with\nhis own. Though disappointed in not having touched the pride of one\nwhom he regarded as a boy, he proceeded, what he considered as far more\nimportant, to quicken the tempers of the men of his own tribe, in order\nthat they might be prepared to work his savage purposes. \"If the earth\nwas covered with rats, which are good for nothing,\" he said, \"there\nwould be no room for buffaloes, which give food and clothes to an\nIndian. If the prairies were covered with Pawnees, there would be\nno room for the foot of a Dahcotah. A Loup is a rat, a Sioux a heavy\nbuffaloe; let the buffaloes tread upon the rats and make room for\nthemselves.\n\n\"My brothers, a little child has spoken to you. He tells you, his hair\nis not grey, but frozen--that the grass will not grow where a Pale-face\nhas died. Does he know the colour of the blood of a Big-knife? No! I\nknow he does not; he has never seen it. What Dahcotah, besides Mahtoree,\nhas ever struck a Pale-face? Not one. But Mahtoree must be silent. Every\nTeton will shut his ears when he speaks. The scalps over his lodge were\ntaken by the women. They were taken by Mahtoree, and he is a woman. His\nmouth is shut; he waits for the feasts to sing among the girls!\"\n\nNotwithstanding the exclamations of regret and resentment, which\nfollowed so abasing a declaration, the chief took his seat, as if\ndetermined to speak no more. But the murmurs grew louder and more\ngeneral, and there were threatening symptoms that the council would\ndissolve itself in confusion; and he arose and resumed his speech, by\nchanging his manner to the fierce and hurried enunciation of a warrior\nbent on revenge.\n\n\"Let my young men go look for Tetao!\" he cried; \"they will find his\nscalp drying in Pawnee smoke. Where is the son of Bohrecheena? His bones\nare whiter than the faces of his murderers. Is Mahhah asleep in his\nlodge? You know it is many moons since he started for the blessed\nprairies; would he were here, that he might say of what colour was the\nhand that took his scalp!\"\n\nIn this strain the artful chief continued for many minutes, calling\nthose warriors by name, who were known to have met their deaths in\nbattle with the Pawnees, or in some of those lawless frays which so\noften occurred between the Sioux bands and a class of white men, who\nwere but little removed from them in the qualities of civilisation. Time\nwas not given to reflect on the merits, or rather the demerits, of most\nof the different individuals to whom he alluded, in consequence of the\nrapid manner in which he ran over their names; but so cunningly did he\ntime his events, and so thrillingly did he make his appeals, aided as\nthey were by the power of his deep-toned and stirring voice, that each\nof them struck an answering chord in the breast of some one of his\nauditors.\n\nIt was in the midst of one of his highest flights of eloquence, that a\nman, so aged as to walk with the greatest difficulty, entered the\nvery centre of the circle, and took his stand directly in front of the\nspeaker. An ear of great acuteness might possibly have detected that the\ntones of the orator faltered a little, as his flashing look first fell\non this unexpected object, though the change was so trifling, that none,\nbut such as thoroughly knew the parties, would have suspected it. The\nstranger had once been as distinguished for his beauty and proportions,\nas had been his eagle eye for its irresistible and terrible glance. But\nhis skin was now wrinkled, and his features furrowed with so many scars,\nas to have obtained for him, half a century before, from the French of\nthe Canadas, a title which has been borne by so many of the heroes of\nFrance, and which had now been adopted into the language of the wild\nhorde of whom we are writing, as the one most expressive of the deeds of\ntheir own brave. The murmur of Le Balafre, that ran through the assembly\nwhen he appeared, announced not only his name and the high estimation\nof his character, but how extraordinary his visit was considered. As\nhe neither spoke nor moved, however, the sensation created by his\nappearance soon subsided, and then every eye was again turned upon\nthe speaker, and every ear once more drunk in the intoxication of his\nmaddening appeals.\n\nIt would have been easy to have traced the triumph of Mahtoree, in the\nreflecting countenances of his auditors. It was not long before a look\nof ferocity and of revenge was to be seen seated on the grim visages of\nmost of the warriors, and each new and crafty allusion to the policy of\nextinguishing their enemies, was followed by fresh and less restrained\nbursts of approbation. In the height of this success the Teton closed\nhis speech, by a rapid appeal to the pride and hardihood of his native\nband, and suddenly took his seat.\n\nIn the midst of the murmurs of applause, which succeeded so remarkable\nan effort of eloquence, a low, feeble and hollow voice was heard rising\non the ear, as if it rolled from the inmost cavities of the human chest,\nand gathered strength and energy as it issued into the air. A solemn\nstillness followed the sounds, and then the lips of the aged man were\nfirst seen to move.\n\n\"The day of Le Balafre is near its end,\" were the first words that were\ndistinctly audible. \"He is like a buffaloe, on whom the hair will grow\nno longer. He will soon be ready to leave his lodge, to go in search of\nanother, that is far from the villages of the Siouxes; therefore, what\nhe has to say concerns not him, but those he leaves behind him. His\nwords are like the fruit on the tree, ripe and fit to be given to\nchiefs.\n\n\"Many snows have fallen since Le Balafre has been found on the war-path.\nHis blood has been very hot, but it has had time to cool. The Wahcondah\ngives him dreams of war no longer; he sees that it is better to live in\npeace.\n\n\"My brothers, one foot is turned to the happy hunting-grounds, the other\nwill soon follow, and then an old chief will be seen looking for the\nprints of his father's moccasins, that he may make no mistake, but be\nsure to come before the Master of Life, by the same path, as so many\ngood Indians have already travelled. But who will follow? Le Balafre has\nno son. His oldest has ridden too many Pawnee horses; the bones of the\nyoungest have been gnawed by Konza dogs! Le Balafre has come to look for\na young arm, on which he may lean, and to find a son, that when he is\ngone his lodge may not be empty. Tachechana, the skipping fawn of the\nTetons, is too weak, to prop a warrior, who is old. She looks before her\nand not backwards. Her mind is in the lodge of her husband.\"\n\nThe enunciation of the veteran warrior had been calm, but distinct, and\ndecided. His declaration was received in silence; and though several of\nthe chiefs, who were in the counsels of Mahtoree, turned their eyes on\ntheir leader, none presumed to oppose so aged and so venerated a brave,\nin a resolution that was strictly in conformity to the usages of the\nnation. The Teton himself was content to await the result with seeming\ncomposure, though the gleams of ferocity, that played about his eye,\noccasionally betrayed the nature of those feelings, with which he\nwitnessed a procedure, that was likely to rob him of that one of all his\nintended victims whom he most hated.\n\nIn the mean time Le Balafre moved with a slow and painful step towards\nthe captives. He stopped before the person of Hard-Heart, whose\nfaultless form, unchanging eye, and lofty mien, he contemplated long,\nwith high and evident satisfaction. Then making a gesture of authority,\nhe awaited, until his order had been obeyed, and the youth was released\nfrom the post and his bonds, by the same blow of the knife. When the\nyoung warrior was led nearer to his dimmed and failing sight, the\nexamination was renewed, with strictness of scrutiny, and that\nadmiration, which physical excellence is so apt to excite in the breast\nof a savage.\n\n\"It is good,\" the wary veteran murmured, when he found that all his\nskill in the requisites of a brave could detect no blemish; \"this is a\nleaping panther! Does my son speak with the tongue of a Teton?\"\n\nThe intelligence, which lighted the eyes of the captive, betrayed how\nwell he understood the question, but still he was far too haughty to\ncommunicate his ideas through the medium of a language that belonged to\na hostile people. Some of the surrounding warriors explained to the old\nchief, that the captive was a Pawnee-Loup.\n\n\"My son opened his eyes on the 'waters of the wolves,'\" said Le Balafre,\nin the language of that nation, \"but he will shut them in the bend of\nthe 'river with a troubled stream.' He was born a Pawnee, but he will\ndie a Dahcotah. Look at me. I am a sycamore, that once covered many with\nmy shadow. The leaves are fallen, and the branches begin to drop. But\na single sucker is springing from my roots; it is a little vine, and it\nwinds itself about a tree that is green. I have long looked for one\nfit to grow by my side. Now have I found him. Le Balafre is no longer\nwithout a son; his name will not be forgotten when he is gone! Men of\nthe Tetons, I take this youth into my lodge.\"\n\nNo one was bold enough to dispute a right, that had so often been\nexercised by warriors far inferior to the present speaker, and the\nadoption was listened to, in grave and respectful silence. Le Balafre\ntook his intended son by the arm, and leading him into the very centre\nof the circle, he stepped aside with an air of triumph, in order\nthat the spectators might approve of his choice. Mahtoree betrayed no\nevidence of his intentions, but rather seemed to await a moment better\nsuited to the crafty policy of his character. The more experienced\nand sagacious chiefs distinctly foresaw the utter impossibility of two\npartisans so renowned, so hostile, and who had so long been rivals in\nfame, as their prisoner and their native leader, existing amicably in\nthe same tribe. Still the character of Le Balafre was so imposing, and\nthe custom to which he had resorted so sacred, that none dared to lift\na voice in opposition to the measure. They watched the result with\nincreasing interest, but with a coldness of demeanour that concealed the\nnature of their inquietude. From this state of embarrassment, and as it\nmight readily have proved of disorganisation, the tribe was unexpectedly\nrelieved by the decision of the one most interested in the success of\nthe aged chief's designs.\n\nDuring the whole of the foregoing scene, it would have been difficult to\nhave traced a single distinct emotion in the lineaments of the captive.\nHe had heard his release proclaimed, with the same indifference as the\norder to bind him to the stake. But now, that the moment had arrived\nwhen it became necessary to make his election, he spoke in a way to\nprove that the fortitude, which had bought him so distinguished a name,\nhad in no degree deserted him.\n\n\"My father is very old, but he has not yet looked upon every thing,\"\nsaid Hard-Heart, in a voice so clear as to be heard by all in presence.\n\"He has never seen a buffaloe change to a bat. He will never see a\nPawnee become a Sioux!\"\n\nThere was a suddenness, and yet a calmness in the manner of delivering\nthis decision, which assured most of the auditors that it was\nunalterable. The heart of Le Balafre, however, was yearning towards the\nyouth, and the fondness of age was not so readily repulsed. Reproving\nthe burst of admiration and triumph, to which the boldness of the\ndeclaration, and the freshened hopes of revenge had given rise, by\nturning his gleaming eye around the band, the veteran again addressed\nhis adopted child, as if his purpose was not to be denied.\n\n\"It is well,\" he said; \"such are the words a brave should use, that\nthe warriors may see his heart. The day has been when the voice of Le\nBalafre was loudest among the lodges of the Konzas. But the root of a\nwhite hair is wisdom. My child will show the Tetons that he is brave, by\nstriking their enemies. Men of the Dahcotahs, this is my son!\"\n\nThe Pawnee hesitated a moment, and then stepping in front of the chief,\nhe took his hard and wrinkled hand, and laid it with reverence on his\nhead, as if to acknowledge the extent of his obligation. Then recoiling\na step, he raised his person to its greatest elevation, and looked upon\nthe hostile band, by whom he was environed, with an air of loftiness and\ndisdain, as he spoke aloud, in the language of the Siouxes--\n\n\"Hard-Heart has looked at himself, within and without. He has thought\nof all he has done in the hunts and in the wars. Every where he is the\nsame. There is no change. He is in all things a Pawnee. He has struck\nso many Tetons that he could never eat in their lodges. His arrows would\nfly backwards; the point of his lance would be on the wrong end; their\nfriends would weep at every whoop he gave; their enemies would laugh. Do\nthe Tetons know a Loup? Let them look at him again. His head is painted;\nhis arm is flesh; his heart is rock. When the Tetons see the sun come\nfrom the Rocky Mountains, and move towards the land of the Pale-faces,\nthe mind of Hard-Heart will soften, and his spirit will become Sioux.\nUntil that day, he will live and die a Pawnee.\"\n\nA yell of delight, in which admiration and ferocity were strangely\nmingled, interrupted the speaker, and but too clearly announced the\ncharacter of his fate. The captive awaited a moment, for the commotion\nto subside, and then turning again to Le Balafre, he continued, in tones\nconciliating and kind, as if he felt the propriety of softening his\nrefusal, in a manner not to wound the pride of one who would so gladly\nbe his benefactor--\n\n\"Let my father lean heavier on the fawn of the Dahcotahs,\" he said: \"she\nis weak now, but as her lodge fills with young, she will be stronger.\nSee,\" he added, directing the eyes of the other to the earnest\ncountenance of the attentive trapper; \"Hard-Heart is not without a\ngrey-head to show him the path to the blessed prairies. If he ever has\nanother father, it shall be that just warrior.\"\n\nLe Balafre turned away in disappointment from the youth, and approached\nthe stranger, who had thus anticipated his design. The examination\nbetween these two aged men was long, mutual, and curious. It was not\neasy to detect the real character of the trapper, through the mask which\nthe hardships of so many years had laid upon his features, especially\nwhen aided by his wild and peculiar attire. Some moments elapsed before\nthe Teton spoke, and then it was in doubt whether he addressed one like\nhimself, or some wanderer of that race who, he had heard, were spreading\nthemselves, like hungry locusts, throughout the land.\n\n\"The head of my brother is very white,\" he said; \"but the eye of Le\nBalafre is no longer like the eagle's. Of what colour is his skin?\"\n\n\"The Wahcondah made me like these you see waiting for a Dahcotah\njudgment; but fair and foul has coloured me darker than the skin of a\nfox. What of that! Though the bark is ragged and riven, the heart of the\ntree is sound.\"\n\n\"My brother is a Big-knife! Let him turn his face towards the setting\nsun, and open his eyes. Does he see the salt lake beyond the mountains?\"\n\n\"The time has been, Teton, when few could see the white on the eagle's\nhead farther than I; but the glare of fourscore and seven winters has\ndimmed my eyes, and but little can I boast of sight in my latter days.\nDoes the Sioux think a Pale-face is a god, that he can look through\nhills?\"\n\n\"Then let my brother look at me. I am nigh him, and he can see that I\nam a foolish Red-man. Why cannot his people see every thing, since they\ncrave all?\"\n\n\"I understand you, chief; nor will I gainsay the justice of your words,\nseeing that they are too much founded in truth. But though born of the\nrace you love so little, my worst enemy, not even a lying Mingo, would\ndare to say that I ever laid hands on the goods of another, except such\nas were taken in manful warfare; or that I ever coveted more ground than\nthe Lord has intended each man to fill.\"\n\n\"And yet my brother has come among the Red-skins to find a son?\"\n\nThe trapper laid a finger on the naked shoulder of Le Balafre, and\nlooked into his scarred countenance with a wistful and confidential\nexpression, as he answered--\n\n\"Ay; but it was only that I might do good to the boy. If you think,\nDahcotah, that I adopted the youth in order to prop my age, you do\nas much injustice to my goodwill, as you seem to know little of the\nmerciless intentions of your own people. I have made him my son, that\nhe may know that one is left behind him. Peace, Hector, peace! Is this\ndecent, pup, when greyheads are counselling together, to break in upon\ntheir discourse with the whinings of a hound! The dog is old, Teton;\nand though well taught in respect of behaviour, he is getting, like\nourselves, I fancy, something forgetful of the fashions of his youth.\"\n\nFurther discourse, between these veterans, was interrupted by a\ndiscordant yell, which burst at that moment from the lips of the dozen\nwithered crones, who have already been mentioned as having forced\nthemselves into a conspicuous part of the circle. The outcry was excited\nby a sudden change in the air of Hard-Heart. When the old men turned\ntowards the youth, they saw him standing in the very centre of the ring,\nwith his head erect, his eye fixed on vacancy, one leg advanced and an\narm a little raised, as if all his faculties were absorbed in the act\nof listening. A smile lighted his countenance, for a single moment,\nand then the whole man sunk again into his former look of dignity and\ncoldness, suddenly recalled to self-possession. The movement had been\nconstrued into contempt, and even the tempers of the chiefs began to be\nexcited. Unable to restrain their fury, the women broke into the circle\nin a body, and commenced their attack by loading the captive with the\nmost bitter revilings. They boasted of the various exploits, which their\nsons had achieved at the expense of the different tribes of the Pawnees.\nThey undervalued his own reputation, and told him to look at Mahtoree,\nif he had never yet seen a warrior. They accused him of having been\nsuckled by a doe, and of having drunk in cowardice with his mother's\nmilk. In short, they lavished upon their unmoved captive a torrent of\nthat vindictive abuse, in which the women of the savages are so well\nknown to excel, but which has been too often described to need a\nrepetition here.\n\nThe effect of this outbreaking was inevitable. Le Balafre turned away\ndisappointed, and hid himself in the crowd, while the trapper, whose\nhonest features were working with inward emotion, pressed nigher to his\nyoung friend, as those who are linked to the criminal, by ties so strong\nas to brave the opinions of men, are often seen to stand about the place\nof execution to support his dying moments. The excitement soon spread\namong the inferior warriors, though the chiefs still forbore to make\nthe signal, which committed the victim to their mercy. Mahtoree, who\nhad awaited such a movement among his fellows, with the wary design of\nconcealing his own jealous hatred, soon grew weary of delay, and, by a\nglance of his eye, encouraged the tormentors to proceed.\n\nWeucha, who, eager for this sanction, had long stood watching the\ncountenance of the chief, bounded forward at the signal like a\nblood-hound loosened from the leash. Forcing his way into the centre\nof the hags, who were already proceeding from abuse to violence, he\nreproved their impatience, and bade them wait, until a warrior had begun\nto torment, and then they should see their victim shed tears like a\nwoman.\n\nThe heartless savage commenced his efforts, by flourishing his tomahawk\nabout the head of the captive, in such a manner as to give reason to\nsuppose, that each blow would bury the weapon in the flesh, while it\nwas so governed as not to touch the skin. To this customary expedient\nHard-Heart was perfectly insensible. His eye kept the same steady,\nriveted look on the air, though the glittering axe described, in its\nevolutions, a bright circle of light before his countenance. Frustrated\nin this attempt, the callous Sioux laid the cold edge on the naked head\nof his victim, and began to describe the different manners, in which\na prisoner might be flayed. The women kept time to his cruelties with\ntheir taunts, and endeavoured to force some expression of the lingerings\nof nature from the insensible features of the Pawnee. But he evidently\nreserved himself for the chiefs, and for those moments of extreme\nanguish, when the loftiness of his spirit might evince itself in a\nmanner better becoming his high and untarnished reputation.\n\nThe eyes of the trapper, followed every movement of the tomahawk, with\nthe interest of a real father, until at length, unable to command his\nindignation, he exclaimed--\n\n\"My son has forgotten his cunning. This is a low-minded Indian, and\none easily hurried into folly. I cannot do the thing myself, for my\ntraditions forbid a dying warrior to revile his persecutors, but the\ngifts of a Red-skin are different. Let the Pawnee say the bitter words\nand purchase an easy death. I will answer for his success, provided he\nspeaks before the grave men set their wisdom to back the folly of this\nfool.\"\n\nThe savage Sioux, who heard his words without comprehending their\nmeaning, turned to the speaker and menaced him with death, for his\ntemerity.\n\n\"Ay, work your will,\" said the unflinching old man; \"I am as ready now\nas I shall be to-morrow. Though it would be a death that an honest man\nmight not wish to die. Look at that noble Pawnee, Teton, and see what a\nRed-skin may become, who fears the Master of Life, and follows his\nlaws. How many of your people has he sent to the distant prairies?\"\nhe continued in a sort of pious fraud, thinking, that while the danger\nmenaced himself, there could surely be no sin in extolling the merits of\nanother; \"how many howling Siouxes has he struck, like a warrior in open\ncombat, while arrows were sailing in the air plentier than flakes of\nfalling snow! Go! will Weucha speak the name of one enemy he has ever\nstruck?\"\n\n\"Hard-Heart!\" shouted the Sioux, turning in his fury, and aiming a\ndeadly blow at the head of his victim. His arm fell into the hollow of\nthe captive's hand. For a single moment the two stood, as if entranced\nin that attitude, the one paralysed by so unexpected a resistance, and\nthe other bending his head, not to meet his death, but in the act of\nthe most intense attention. The women screamed with triumph, for they\nthought the nerves of the captive had at length failed him. The trapper\ntrembled for the honour of his friend; and Hector, as if conscious of\nwhat was passing, raised his nose into the air, and uttered a piteous\nhowl.\n\nBut the Pawnee hesitated, only for that moment. Raising the other hand,\nlike lightning, the tomahawk flashed in the air, and Weucha sunk to his\nfeet, brained to the eye. Then cutting a way with the bloody weapon, he\ndarted through the opening, left by the frightened women, and seemed to\ndescend the declivity at a single bound.\n\nHad a bolt from Heaven fallen in the midst of the Teton band it would\nnot have occasioned greater consternation, than this act of desperate\nhardihood. A shrill plaintive cry burst from the lips of all the women,\nand there was a moment, that even the oldest warriors appeared to have\nlost their faculties. This stupor endured only for the instant. It was\nsucceeded by a yell of revenge, that burst from a hundred throats, while\nas many warriors started forward at the cry, bent on the most bloody\nretribution. But a powerful and authoritative call from Mahtoree\narrested every foot. The chief, in whose countenance disappointment\nand rage were struggling with the affected composure of his station,\nextended an arm towards the river, and the whole mystery was explained.\n\nHard-Heart had already crossed half the bottom, which lay between the\nacclivity and the water. At this precise moment a band of armed and\nmounted Pawnees turned a swell, and galloped to the margin of the\nstream, into which the plunge of the fugitive was distinctly heard. A\nfew minutes sufficed for his vigorous arm to conquer the passage, and\nthen the shout from the opposite shore told the humbled Tetons the whole\nextent of the triumph of their adversaries.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n  If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly; the curses he\n  shall have, the tortures he shall feel, will break the back of\n  man, the heart of monster.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nIt will readily be seen that the event just related was attended by an\nextraordinary sensation among the Siouxes. In leading the hunters of\nthe band back to the encampment, their chief had neglected none of the\ncustomary precautions of Indian prudence, in order that his trail might\nescape the eyes of his enemies. It would seem, however, that the Pawnees\nhad not only made the dangerous discovery, but had managed with great\nart to draw nigh the place, by the only side on which it was thought\nunnecessary to guard the approaches with the usual line of sentinels.\nThe latter, who were scattered along the different little eminences,\nwhich lay in the rear of the lodges, were among the last to be apprized\nof the danger.\n\nIn such a crisis there was little time for deliberation. It was by\nexhibiting the force of his character in scenes of similar difficulty,\nthat Mahtoree had obtained and strengthened his ascendency among his\npeople, nor did he seem likely to lose it by the manifestation of any\nindecision on the present occasion. In the midst of the screams of the\nyoung, the shrieks of the women, and the wild howlings of the crones,\nwhich were sufficient of themselves to have created a chaos in the\nthoughts of one less accustomed to act in emergencies, he promptly\nasserted his authority, issuing his orders with the coolness of a\nveteran.\n\nWhile the warriors were arming, the boys were despatched to the bottom\nfor the horses. The tents were hastily struck by the women, and disposed\nof on such of the beasts as were not deemed fit to be trusted in\ncombat. The infants were cast upon the backs of their mothers, and those\nchildren, who were of a size to march, were driven to the rear, like a\nherd of less reasoning animals. Though these several movements were made\namid outcries, and a clamour, that likened the place to another Babel,\nthey were executed with incredible alacrity and intelligence.\n\nIn the mean time, Mahtoree neglected no duty that belonged to his\nresponsible station. From the elevation, on which he stood, he could\ncommand a perfect view of the force and evolutions of the hostile\nparty. A grim smile lighted his visage, when he found that, in point\nof numbers, his own band was greatly the superior. Notwithstanding this\nadvantage, however, there were other points of inequality, which would\nprobably have a tendency to render his success, in the approaching\nconflict, exceedingly doubtful. His people were the inhabitants of a\nmore northern and less hospitable region than their enemies, and were\nfar from being rich in that species of property, horses and arms, which\nconstitutes the most highly prized wealth of a western Indian. The band\nin view was mounted to a man; and as it had come so far to rescue, or\nto revenge, their greatest partisan, he had no reason to doubt its being\ncomposed entirely of braves. On the other hand, many of his followers\nwere far better in a hunt than in a combat; men who might serve to\ndivert the attention of his foes, but from whom he could expect little\ndesperate service. Still, his flashing eye glanced over a body of\nwarriors on whom he had often relied, and who had never deceived him;\nand though, in the precise position in which he found himself, he felt\nno disposition to precipitate the conflict, he certainly would have had\nno intention to avoid it, had not the presence of his women and children\nplaced the option altogether in the power of his adversaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the Pawnees, so unexpectedly successful in their\nfirst and greatest object, manifested no intention to drive matters to\nan issue. The river was a dangerous barrier to pass, in the face of a\ndetermined foe, and it would now have been in perfect accordance with\ntheir cautious policy, to have retired for a season, in order that their\nonset might be made in the hours of darkness, and of seeming security.\nBut there was a spirit in their chief that elevated him, for the moment,\nabove the ordinary expedients of savage warfare. His bosom burned with\nthe desire to wipe out that disgrace of which he had been the subject;\nand it is possible, that he believed the retiring camp of the Siouxes\ncontained a prize, that began to have a value in his eyes, far exceeding\nany that could be found in fifty Teton scalps. Let that be as it might,\nHard-Heart had no sooner received the brief congratulations of his band,\nand communicated to the chiefs such facts as were important to be known,\nthan he prepared himself to act such a part in the coming conflict,\nas would at once maintain his well-earned reputation, and gratify his\nsecret wishes. A led horse, one that had been long trained in the hunts,\nhad been brought to receive his master, with but little hope that his\nservices would ever be needed again in this life. With a delicacy and\nconsideration, that proved how much the generous qualities of the youth\nhad touched the feelings of his people, a bow, a lance, and a quiver,\nwere thrown across the animal, which it had been intended to immolate\non the grave of the young brave; a species of care that would have\nsuperseded the necessity for the pious duty that the trapper had pledged\nhimself to perform.\n\nThough Hard-Heart was sensible of the kindness of his warriors, and\nbelieved that a chief, furnished with such appointments, might depart\nwith credit for the distant hunting-grounds of the Master of Life, he\nseemed equally disposed to think that they might be rendered quite as\nuseful, in the actual state of things. His countenance lighted with\nstern pleasure, as he tried the elasticity of the bow, and poised the\nwell-balanced spear. The glance he bestowed on the shield was more\ncursory and indifferent; but the exultation with which he threw himself\non the back of his favoured war-horse was so great, as to break through\nthe forms of Indian reserve. He rode to and fro among his scarcely less\ndelighted warriors, managing the animal with a grace and address that no\nartificial rules can ever supply; at times flourishing his lance, as if\nto assure himself of his seat, and at others examining critically into\nthe condition of the fusee, with which he had also been furnished, with\nthe fondness of one, who was miraculously restored to the possession of\ntreasures, that constituted his pride and his happiness.\n\nAt this particular moment Mahtoree, having completed the necessary\narrangements, prepared to make a more decisive movement. The Teton had\nfound no little embarrassment in disposing of his captives. The tents of\nthe squatter were still in sight, and his wary cunning did not fail to\napprise him, that it was quite as necessary to guard against an attack\nfrom that quarter as to watch the motions of his more open and more\nactive foes. His first impulse had been to make the tomahawk suffice for\nthe men, and to trust the females under the same protection as the women\nof his band; but the manner, in which many of his braves continued to\nregard the imaginary medicine of the Long-knives, forewarned him of the\ndanger of so hazardous an experiment on the eve of a battle. It might\nbe deemed the omen of defeat. In this dilemma he motioned to a\nsuperannuated warrior, to whom he had confided the charge of the\nnon-combatants, and leading him apart, he placed a finger significantly\non his shoulder, as he said, in a tone, in which authority was tempered\nby confidence--\n\n\"When my young men are striking the Pawnees, give the women knives.\nEnough; my father is very old; he does not want to hear wisdom from a\nboy.\"\n\nThe grim old savage returned a look of ferocious assent, and then the\nmind of the chief appeared to be at rest on this important subject. From\nthat moment he bestowed all his care on the achievement of his revenge,\nand the maintenance of his martial character. Throwing himself on his\nhorse, he made a sign, with the air of a prince to his followers, to\nimitate his example, interrupting, without ceremony, the war songs and\nsolemn rites by which many among them were stimulating their spirits\nto deeds of daring. When all were in order, the whole moved with great\nsteadiness and silence towards the margin of the river.\n\nThe hostile bands were now separated by the water. The width of\nthe stream was too great to admit of the use of the ordinary Indian\nmissiles, but a few useless shots were exchanged from the fusees of the\nchiefs, more in bravado than with any expectation of doing execution.\nAs some time was suffered to elapse, in demonstrations and abortive\nefforts, we shall leave them, for that period, to return to such of our\ncharacters as remained in the hands of the savages.\n\nWe have shed much ink in vain, and wasted quires, that might possibly\nhave been better employed, if it be necessary now to tell the reader\nthat few of the foregoing movements escaped the observation of the\nexperienced trapper. He had been, in common with the rest, astonished\nat the sudden act of Hard-Heart; and there was a single moment when a\nfeeling of regret and mortification got the better of his longings to\nsave the life of the youth. The simple and well-intentioned old man\nwould have felt, at witnessing any failure of firmness on the part of a\nwarrior, who had so strongly excited his sympathies, the same species\nof sorrow that a Christian parent would suffer in hanging over the\ndying moments of an impious child. But when, instead of an impotent and\nunmanly struggle for existence, he found that his friend had forborne,\nwith the customary and dignified submission of an Indian warrior, until\nan opportunity had offered to escape, and that he had then manifested\nthe spirit and decision of the most gifted brave, his gratification\nbecame nearly too powerful to be concealed. In the midst of the wailing\nand commotion, which succeeded the death of Weucha and the escape of\nthe captive, he placed himself nigh the persons of his white associates,\nwith a determination of interfering, at every hazard, should the fury\nof the savages take that direction. The appearance of the hostile band\nspared him, however, so desperate and probably so fruitless an effort,\nand left him to pursue his observations, and to mature his plans more at\nleisure.\n\nHe particularly remarked that, while by far the greater part of the\nwomen, and all the children, together with the effects of the party,\nwere hurried to the rear, probably with an order to secrete themselves\nin some of the adjacent woods, the tent of Mahtoree himself was left\nstanding, and its contents undisturbed. Two chosen horses, however,\nstood near by, held by a couple of youths, who were too young to go\ninto the conflict, and yet of an age to understand the management of\nthe beasts. The trapper perceived in this arrangement the reluctance of\nMahtoree to trust his newly-found flowers beyond the reach of his eye;\nand, at the same time, his forethought in providing against a reverse of\nfortune. Neither had the manner of the Teton, in giving his commission\nto the old savage, nor the fierce pleasure with which the latter had\nreceived the bloody charge, escaped his observation. From all these\nmysterious movements, the old man was aware that a crisis was at hand,\nand he summoned the utmost knowledge he had acquired, in so long a life,\nto aid him in the desperate conjuncture. While musing on the means to\nbe employed, the Doctor again attracted his attention to himself, by a\npiteous appeal for assistance.\n\n\"Venerable trapper, or, as I may now say, liberator,\" commenced the\ndolorous Obed, \"it would seem, that a fitting time has at length arrived\nto dissever the unnatural and altogether irregular connection, which\nexists between my inferior members and the body of Asinus. Perhaps if\nsuch a portion of my limbs were released as might leave me master of the\nremainder, and this favourable opportunity were suitably improved, by\nmaking a forced march towards the settlements, all hopes of preserving\nthe treasures of knowledge, of which I am the unworthy receptacle, would\nnot be lost. The importance of the results is surely worth the hazard of\nthe experiment.\"\n\n\"I know not, I know not,\" returned the deliberate old man; \"the vermin\nand reptiles, which you bear about you, were intended by the Lord for\nthe prairies, and I see no good in sending them into regions that\nmay not suit their natur's. And, moreover, you may be of great and\nparticular use as you now sit on the ass, though it creates no wonder in\nmy mind to perceive that you are ignorant of it, seeing that usefulness\nis altogether a new calling to so bookish a man.\"\n\n\"Of what service can I be in this painful thraldom, in which the animal\nfunctions are in a manner suspended, and the spiritual, or intellectual,\nblinded by the secret sympathy that unites mind to matter? There is\nlikely to be blood spilt between yonder adverse hosts of heathens; and,\nthough but little desiring the office, it would be better that I should\nemploy myself in surgical experiments, than in thus wasting the precious\nmoments, mortifying both soul and body.\"\n\n\"It is little that a Red-skin would care to have a physician at his\nhurts, while the whoop is ringing in his ears. Patience is a virtue in\nan Indian, and can be no shame to a Christian white man. Look at these\nhags of squaws, friend Doctor; I have no judgment in savage tempers, if\nthey are not bloody minded, and ready to work their accursed pleasures\non us all. Now, so long as you keep upon the ass, and maintain the\nfierce look which is far from being your natural gift, fear of so great\na medicine may serve to keep down their courage. I am placed here, like\na general at the opening of the battle, and it has become my duty to\nmake such use of all my force as, in my judgment, each is best fitted to\nperform. If I know these niceties, you will be more serviceable for your\ncountenance just now than in any more stirring exploits.\"\n\n\"Harkee, old trapper,\" shouted Paul, whose patience could no longer\nmaintain itself under the calculating and prolix explanations of the\nother, \"suppose you cut two things I can name, short off. That is to\nsay, your conversation, which is agreeable enough over a well baked\nbuffaloe's hump, and these damnable thongs of hide, which, according to\nmy experience, can be pleasant nowhere. A single stroke of your knife\nwould be of more service, just now, than the longest speech that was\never made in a Kentucky court-house.\"\n\n\"Ay, court-houses are the 'happy hunting-grounds,' as a Red-skin would\nsay, for them that are born with gifts no better than such as lie in the\ntongue. I was carried into one of the lawless holes myself once, and it\nwas all about a thing of no more value than the skin of a deer. The Lord\nforgive them!--the Lord forgive them!--they knew no better, and they did\naccording to their weak judgments, and therefore the more are they to be\npitied; and yet it was a solemn sight to see an aged man, who had always\nlived in the air, laid neck and heels by the law, and held up as a\nspectacle for the women and boys of a wasteful settlement to point their\nfingers at!\"\n\n\"If such be your opinions of confinement, honest friend, you had better\nmanifest the same, by putting us at liberty with as little delay as\npossible,\" said Middleton, who, like his companion, began to find the\ntardiness of his often-tried companion quite as extraordinary as it was\ndisagreeable.\n\n\"I should greatly like to do the same; especially in your behalf,\nCaptain, who, being a soldier, might find not only pleasure but profit\nin examining, more at your ease, into the circumventions and cunning of\nan Indian fight. As to our friend, here, it is of but little matter, how\nmuch of this affair he examines, or how little, seeing that a bee is not\nto be overcome in the same manner as an Indian.\"\n\n\"Old man, this trifling with our misery is inconsiderate, to give it a\nname no harsher--\"\n\n\"Ay, your grand'ther was of a hot and hurrying mind, and one must not\nexpect, that the young of a panther will crawl the 'arth like the litter\nof a porcupine. Now keep you both silent, and what I say shall have the\nappearance of being spoken concerning the movements that are going on\nin the bottom; all of which will serve to put jealousy to sleep, and to\nshut the eyes of such as rarely close them on wickedness and cruelty. In\nthe first place, then, you must know that I have reason to think yonder\ntreacherous Teton has left an order to put us all to death, so soon as\nhe thinks the deed may be done secretly, and without tumult.\"\n\n\"Great Heaven! will you suffer us to be butchered like unresisting\nsheep?\"\n\n\"Hist, Captain, hist; a hot temper is none of the best, when cunning is\nmore needed than blows. Ah, the Pawnee is a noble boy! it would do your\nheart good to see how he draws off from the river, in order to invite\nhis enemies to cross; and yet, according to my failing sight, they count\ntwo warriors to his one! But as I was saying, little good comes of haste\nand thoughtlessness. The facts are so plain that any child may see into\ntheir wisdom. The savages are of many minds as to the manner of our\ntreatment. Some fear us for colour, and would gladly let us go, and\nother some would show us the mercy that the doe receives from the hungry\nwolf. When opposition gets fairly into the councils of a tribe, it\nis rarely that humanity is the gainer. Now see you these wrinkled\nand cruel-minded squaws--No, you cannot see them as you lie, but\nnevertheless they are here, ready and willing, like so many raging\nshe-bears, to work their will upon us so soon as the proper time shall\ncome.\"\n\n\"Harkee, old gentleman trapper,\" interrupted Paul, with a little\nbitterness in his manner; \"do you tell us these matters for our\namusement, or for your own? If for ours, you may keep your breath for\nthe next race you run, as I am tickled nearly to suffocation, already,\nwith my part of the fun.\"\n\n\"Hist\"--said the trapper, cutting with great dexterity and rapidity the\nthong, which bound one of the arms of Paul to his body, and dropping his\nknife at the same time within reach of the liberated hand. \"Hist, boy,\nhist; that was a lucky moment! The yell from the bottom drew the eyes of\nthese blood-suckers in another quarter, and so far we are safe. Now make\na proper use of your advantages; but be careful, that what you do, is\ndone without being seen.\"\n\n\"Thank you for this small favour, old deliberation,\" muttered the\nbee-hunter, \"though it comes like a snow in May, somewhat out of\nseason.\"\n\n\"Foolish boy!\" reproachfully exclaimed the other, who had moved to\na little distance from his friends, and appeared to be attentively\nregarding the movements of the hostile parties, \"will you never learn to\nknow the wisdom of patience? And you, too, Captain; though a man myself,\nthat seldom ruffles his temper by vain feelings, I see that you are\nsilent, because you scorn to ask favours any longer from one you think\ntoo slow to grant them. No doubt, ye are both young, and filled with the\npride of your strength and manhood, and I dare say you thought it only\nneedful to cut the thongs, to leave you masters of the ground. But he,\nthat has seen much, is apt to think much. Had I run like a bustling\nwoman to have given you freedom, these hags of the Siouxes would have\nseen the same, and then where would you both have found yourselves?\nUnder the tomahawk and the knife, like helpless and outcrying children,\nthough gifted with the size and beards of men. Ask our friend, the\nbee-hunter, in what condition he finds himself to struggle with a Teton\nboy, after so many hours of bondage; much less with a dozen merciless\nand bloodthirsty squaws!\"\n\n\"Truly, old trapper,\" returned Paul, stretching his limbs, which were by\nthis time entirely released, and endeavouring to restore the suspended\ncirculation, \"you have some judgmatical notions in these matters. Now\nhere am I, Paul Hover, a man who will give in to few at wrestle or race,\nnearly as helpless as the day I paid my first visit to the house of old\nPaul, who is dead and gone,--the Lord forgive him any little blunders he\nmay have made while he tarried in Kentucky! Now there is my foot on the\nground, so far as eye-sight has any virtue, and yet it would take no\ngreat temptation to make me swear it didn't touch the earth by six\ninches. I say, honest friend, since you have done so much, have\nthe goodness to keep these damnable squaws, of whom you say so many\ninteresting things, at a little distance, till I have got the blood of\nthis arm in motion, and am ready to receive them.\"\n\nThe trapper made a sign that he perfectly understood the case; and\nhe walked towards the superannuated savage, who began to manifest an\nintention of commencing his assigned task, leaving the bee-hunter to\nrecover the use of his limbs as well as he could, and to put Middleton\nin a similar situation to defend himself.\n\nMahtoree had not mistaken his man, in selecting the one he did to\nexecute his bloody purpose. He had chosen one of those ruthless savages,\nmore or less of whom are to be found in every tribe, who had purchased\na certain share of military reputation, by the exhibition of a hardihood\nthat found its impulses in an innate love of cruelty. Contrary to the\nhigh and chivalrous sentiment, which among the Indians of the prairies\nrenders it a deed of even greater merit to bear off the trophy of\nvictory from a fallen foe, than to slay him, he had been remarkable for\npreferring the pleasure of destroying life, to the glory of striking the\ndead. While the more self-devoted and ambitious braves were intent\non personal honour, he had always been seen, established behind some\nfavourable cover, depriving the wounded of hope, by finishing that which\na more gallant warrior had begun. In all the cruelties of the tribe he\nhad ever been foremost; and no Sioux was so uniformly found on the side\nof merciless councils.\n\nHe had awaited, with an impatience which his long practised restraint\ncould with difficulty subdue, for the moment to arrive when he might\nproceed to execute the wishes of the great chief, without whose\napprobation and powerful protection he would not have dared to undertake\na step, that had so many opposers in the nation. But events had been\nhastening to an issue, between the hostile parties; and the time had now\narrived, greatly to his secret and malignant joy, when he was free to\nact his will.\n\nThe trapper found him distributing knives to the ferocious hags, who\nreceived the presents chanting a low monotonous song, that recalled the\nlosses of their people, in various conflicts with the whites, and which\nextolled the pleasures and glory of revenge. The appearance of such a\ngroup was enough of itself to have deterred one, less accustomed to\nsuch sights than the old man, from trusting himself within the circle of\ntheir wild and repulsive rites.\n\nEach of the crones, as she received the weapon, commenced a slow and\nmeasured, but ungainly, step, around the savage, until the whole were\ncircling him in a sort of magic dance. The movements were timed, in\nsome degree, by the words of their songs, as were their gestures by\nthe ideas. When they spoke of their own losses, they tossed their\nlong straight locks of grey into the air, or suffered them to fall in\nconfusion upon their withered necks; but as the sweetness of returning\nblow for blow was touched upon, by any among them, it was answered by a\ncommon howl, as well as by gestures, that were sufficiently expressive\nof the manner in which they were exciting themselves to the necessary\nstate of fury.\n\nInto the very centre of this ring of seeming demons, the trapper now\nstalked, with the same calmness and observation as he would have walked\ninto a village church. No other change was made by his appearance, than\na renewal of the threatening gestures, with, if possible, a still less\nequivocal display of their remorseless intentions. Making a sign for\nthem to cease, the old man demanded--\n\n\"Why do the mothers of the Tetons sing with bitter tongues? The Pawnee\nprisoners are not yet in their village; their young men have not come\nback loaded with scalps!\"\n\nHe was answered by a general howl, and a few of the boldest of the\nfuries even ventured to approach him, flourishing their knives within a\ndangerous proximity of his own steady eye-balls.\n\n\"It is a warrior you see, and no runner of the Long-knives, whose face\ngrows paler at the sight of a tomahawk,\" returned the trapper, without\nmoving a muscle. \"Let the Sioux women think; if one White-skin dies, a\nhundred spring up where he falls.\"\n\nStill the hags made no other answer, than by increasing their speed\nin the circle, and occasionally raising the threatening expressions of\ntheir chant, into louder and more intelligible strains. Suddenly, one of\nthe oldest, and the most ferocious of them all, broke out of the ring,\nand skirred away in the direction of her victims, like a rapacious bird,\nthat having wheeled on poised wings, for the time necessary to ensure\nits object, makes the final dart upon its prey. The others followed, a\ndisorderly and screaming flock, fearful of being too late to reap their\nportion of the sanguinary pleasure.\n\n\"Mighty medicine of my people!\" shouted the old man, in the Teton\ntongue; \"lift your voice and speak, that the Sioux nation may hear.\"\n\nWhether Asinus had acquired so much knowledge, by his recent experience,\nas to know the value of his sonorous properties, or the strange\nspectacle of a dozen hags flitting past him, filling the air with\nsuch sounds as were even grating to the ears of an ass, most moved his\ntemper, it is certain that the animal did that which Obed was requested\nto do, and probably with far greater effect than if the naturalist had\nstrove with his mightiest effort to be heard. It was the first time\nthe strange beast had spoken, since his arrival in the encampment.\nAdmonished by so terrible a warning, the hags scattered themselves,\nlike vultures frightened from their prey, still screaming, and but half\ndiverted from their purpose.\n\nIn the mean time the sudden appearance, and the imminency of the danger,\nquickened the blood in the veins of Paul and Middleton, more than all\ntheir laborious frictions, and physical expedients. The former had\nactually risen to his feet, and assumed an attitude which perhaps\nthreatened more than the worthy bee-hunter was able to perform, and even\nthe latter had mounted to his knees, and shown a disposition to do good\nservice for his life. The unaccountable release of the captives from\ntheir bonds was attributed, by the hags, to the incantations of the\nmedicine; and the mistake was probably of as much service, as the\nmiraculous and timely interposition of Asinus in their favour.\n\n\"Now is the time to come out of our ambushment,\" exclaimed the old man,\nhastening to join his friends, \"and to make open and manful war. It\nwould have been policy to have kept back the struggle, until the Captain\nwas in better condition to join, but as we have unmasked our battery,\nwhy, we must maintain the ground--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by feeling a gigantic hand on his shoulder. Turning,\nunder a sort of confused impression that necromancy was actually abroad\nin the place, he found that he was in the hands of a sorcerer no less\ndangerous and powerful than Ishmael Bush. The file of the squatter's\nwell-armed sons, that was seen issuing from behind the still standing\ntent of Mahtoree, explained at once, not only the manner in which\ntheir rear had been turned, while their attention had been so earnestly\nbestowed on matters in front, but the utter impossibility of resistance.\n\nNeither Ishmael, nor his sons deemed it necessary to enter into prolix\nexplanations. Middleton and Paul were bound again, with extraordinary\nsilence and despatch, and this time not even the aged trapper was exempt\nfrom a similar fortune. The tent was struck, the females placed upon the\nhorses, and the whole were on the way towards the squatter's encampment,\nwith a celerity that might well have served to keep alive the idea of\nmagic.\n\nDuring this summary and brief disposition of things, the disappointed\nagent of Mahtoree and his callous associates were seen flying across the\nplain, in the direction of the retiring families; and when Ishmael left\nthe spot with his prisoners and his booty, the ground, which had so\nlately been alive with the bustle and life of an extensive Indian\nencampment, was as still and empty as any other spot in those extensive\nwastes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n               Is this proceeding just and honourable?\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nDuring the occurrence of these events on the upland plain, the warriors\non the bottom had not been idle. We left the adverse bands watching one\nanother on the opposite banks of the stream, each endeavouring to excite\nits enemy to some act of indiscretion, by the most reproachful taunts\nand revilings. But the Pawnee chief was not slow to discover that his\ncrafty antagonist had no objection to waste the time so idly, and, as\nthey mutually proved, in expedients that were so entirely useless. He\nchanged his plans, accordingly, and withdrew from the bank, as has been\nalready explained through the mouth of the trapper, in order to invite\nthe more numerous host of the Siouxes to cross. The challenge was not\naccepted, and the Loups were compelled to frame some other method to\nattain their end.\n\nInstead of any longer throwing away the precious moments, in fruitless\nendeavours to induce his foe to cross the stream, the young partisan\nof the Pawnees led his troops, at a swift gallop, along its margin, in\nquest of some favourable spot, where by a sudden push he might throw his\nown band without loss to the opposite shore. The instant his object\nwas discovered, each mounted Teton received a footman behind him, and\nMahtoree was still enabled to concentrate his whole force against the\neffort. Perceiving that his design was anticipated, and unwilling to\nblow his horses by a race that would disqualify them for service, even\nafter they had succeeded in outstripping the more heavily-burdened\ncattle of the Siouxes, Hard-Heart drew up, and came to a dead halt on\nthe very margin of the water-course.\n\nAs the country was too open for any of the usual devices of savage\nwarfare, and time was so pressing, the chivalrous Pawnee resolved to\nbring on the result by one of those acts of personal daring, for which\nthe Indian braves are so remarkable, and by which they often purchase\ntheir highest and dearest renown. The spot he had selected was\nfavourable to such a project. The river, which throughout most of its\ncourse was deep and rapid, had expanded there to more than twice its\ncustomary width, and the rippling of its waters proved that it flowed\nover a shallow bottom. In the centre of the current there was an\nextensive and naked bed of sand, but a little raised above the level\nof the stream and of a colour and consistency which warranted, to a\npractised eye, that it afforded a firm and safe foundation for the foot.\nTo this spot the partisan now turned his wistful gaze, nor was he long\nin making his decision. First speaking to his warriors, and apprising\nthem of his intentions, he dashed into the current, and partly by\nswimming, and more by the use of his horse's feet, he reached the island\nin safety.\n\nThe experience of Hard-Heart had not deceived him. When his snorting\nsteed issued from the water, he found himself on a tremendous but damp\nand compact bed of sand, that was admirably adapted to the exhibition\nof the finest powers of the animal. The horse seemed conscious of the\nadvantage, and bore his warlike rider, with an elasticity of step and\na loftiness of air, that would have done no discredit to the highest\ntrained and most generous charger. The blood of the chief himself\nquickened with the excitement of his situation. He sat the beast as\nif conscious that the eyes of two tribes were on his movements; and as\nnothing could be more acceptable and grateful to his own band, than this\ndisplay of native grace and courage, so nothing could be more taunting\nand humiliating to their enemies.\n\nThe sudden appearance of the Pawnee on the sands was announced among the\nTetons, by a general yell of savage anger. A rush was made to the shore,\nfollowed by a discharge of fifty arrows and a few fusees, and, on the\npart of several braves, there was a plain manifestation of a desire to\nplunge into the water, in order to punish the temerity of their insolent\nfoe. But a call and a mandate, from Mahtoree, checked the rising, and\nnearly ungovernable, temper of his band. So far from allowing a single\nfoot to be wet, or a repetition of the fruitless efforts of his people\nto drive away their foe with missiles, the whole of the party was\ncommanded to retire from the shore, while he himself communicated his\nintentions to one or two of his most favoured followers.\n\nWhen the Pawnees observed the rush of their enemies, twenty warriors\nrode into the stream; but so soon as they perceived that the Tetons\nhad withdrawn, they fell back to a man, leaving the young chief to the\nsupport of his own often-tried skill and well-established courage. The\ninstructions of Hard-Heart, on quitting his band, had been worthy of the\nself-devotion and daring of his character. So long as single warriors\ncame against him, he was to be left to the keeping of the Wahcondah and\nhis own arm; but should the Siouxes attack him in numbers, he was to\nbe sustained, man for man, even to the extent of his whole force. These\ngenerous orders were strictly obeyed; and though so many hearts in the\ntroop panted to share in the glory and danger of their partisan, not a\nwarrior was found, among them all, who did not know how to conceal his\nimpatience under the usual mask of Indian self-restraint. They watched\nthe issue with quick and jealous eyes, nor did a single exclamation of\nsurprise escape them, when they saw, as will soon be apparent, that the\nexperiment of their chief was as likely to conduce to peace as to war.\n\nMahtoree was not long in communicating his plans to his confidants, whom\nhe as quickly dismissed to join their fellows in the rear. The Teton\nentered a short distance into the stream and halted. Here he raised his\nhand several times, with the palm outwards, and made several of those\nother signs, which are construed into a pledge of amicable intentions\namong the inhabitants of those regions. Then, as if to confirm the\nsincerity of his faith, he cast his fusee to the shore, and entered\ndeeper into the water, where he again came to a stand, in order to see\nin what manner the Pawnee would receive his pledges of peace.\n\nThe crafty Sioux had not made his calculations on the noble and honest\nnature of his more youthful rival in vain. Hard-Heart had continued\ngalloping across the sands, during the discharge of missiles and the\nappearance of a general onset, with the same proud and confident mien,\nas that with which he had first braved the danger. When he saw the\nwell-known person of the Teton partisan enter the river, he waved his\nhand in triumph, and flourishing his lance, he raised the thrilling\nwar-cry of his people, as a challenge for him to come on. But when he\nsaw the signs of a truce, though deeply practised in the treachery of\nsavage combats, he disdained to show a less manly reliance on himself,\nthan that which his enemy had seen fit to exhibit. Riding to the\nfarthest extremity of the sands, he cast his own fusee from him, and\nreturned to the point whence he had started.\n\nThe two chiefs were now armed alike. Each had his spear, his bow, his\nquiver, his little battle-axe, and his knife; and each had, also, a\nshield of hides, which might serve as a means of defence against a\nsurprise from any of these weapons. The Sioux no longer hesitated,\nbut advanced deeper into the stream, and soon landed on a point of the\nisland which his courteous adversary had left free for that purpose. Had\none been there to watch the countenance of Mahtoree, as he crossed the\nwater that separated him from the most formidable and the most hated of\nall his rivals, he might have fancied that he could trace the gleamings\nof a secret joy, breaking through the cloud which deep cunning and\nheartless treachery had drawn before his swarthy visage; and yet there\nwould have been moments, when he might have believed that the flashings\nof the Teton's eye and the expansion of his nostrils, had their origin\nin a nobler sentiment, and one more worthy of an Indian chief.\n\nThe Pawnee awaited the time of his enemy with calmness and dignity. The\nTeton made a short run or two, to curb the impatience of his steed, and\nto recover his seat after the effort of crossing, and then he rode into\nthe centre of the place, and invited the other, by a courteous gesture,\nto approach. Hard-Heart drew nigh, until he found himself at a distance\nequally suited to advance or to retreat, and, in his turn, he came to a\nstand, keeping his glowing eye riveted on that of his enemy. A long\nand grave pause succeeded this movement, during which these two\ndistinguished braves, who were now, for the first time, confronted, with\narms in their hands, sat regarding each other, like warriors who knew\nhow to value the merits of a gallant foe, however hated. But the mien of\nMahtoree was far less stern and warlike than that of the partisan of\nthe Loups. Throwing his shield over his shoulder, as if to invite the\nconfidence of the other, he made a gesture of salutation and was the\nfirst to speak.\n\n\"Let the Pawnees go upon the hills,\" he said, \"and look from the morning\nto the evening sun, from the country of snows to the land of many\nflowers, and they will see that the earth is very large. Why cannot the\nRed-men find room on it for all their villages?\"\n\n\"Has the Teton ever known a warrior of the Loups come to his towns to\nbeg a place for his lodge?\" returned the young brave, with a look in\nwhich pride and contempt were not attempted to be concealed, \"when\nthe Pawnees hunt, do they send runners to ask Mahtoree if there are no\nSiouxes on the prairies?\"\n\n\"When there is hunger in the lodge of a warrior, he looks for the\nbuffaloe, which is given him for food,\" the Teton continued, struggling\nto keep down the ire excited by the other's scorn. \"The Wahcondah\nhas made more of them than he has made Indians. He has not said, This\nbuffaloe shall be for a Pawnee, and that for a Dahcotah; this beaver for\nKonza, and that for an Omawhaw. No; he said, There are enough. I love\nmy red children, and I have given them great riches. The swiftest horse\nshall not go from the village of the Tetons to the village of the Loups\nin many suns. It is far from the towns of the Pawnees to the river of\nthe Osages. There is room for all that I love. Why then should a Red-man\nstrike his brother?\"\n\nHard-Heart dropped one end of his lance to the earth, and having also\ncast his shield across his shoulder, he sat leaning lightly on the\nweapon, as he answered with a smile of no doubtful expression--\n\n\"Are the Tetons weary of the hunts, and of the warpath? Do they wish\nto cook the venison, and not to kill it? Do they intend to let the hair\ncover their heads, that their enemies shall not know where to find their\nscalps? Go; a Pawnee warrior will never come among such Sioux squaws for\na wife!\"\n\nA frightful gleam of ferocity broke out of the restraint of the\nDahcotah's countenance, as he listened to this biting insult; but he was\nquick in subduing the tell-tale feeling, in an expression much better\nsuited to his present purpose.\n\n\"This is the way a young chief should talk of war,\" he answered with\nsingular composure; \"but Mahtoree has seen the misery of more winters\nthan his brother. When the nights have been long, and darkness has been\nin his lodge, while the young men slept, he has thought of the hardships\nof his people. He has said to himself, Teton, count the scalps in your\nsmoke. They are all red but two! Does the wolf destroy the wolf, or the\nrattler strike his brother? You know they do not; therefore, Teton, are\nyou wrong to go on a path that leads to the village of a Red-skin, with\na tomahawk in your hand.\"\n\n\"The Sioux would rob the warrior of his fame? He would say to his\nyoung men, Go, dig roots in the prairies, and find holes to bury your\ntomahawks in; you are no longer braves!\"\n\n\"If the tongue of Mahtoree ever says thus,\" returned the crafty chief,\nwith an appearance of strong indignation, \"let his women cut it out, and\nburn it with the offals of the buffaloe. No,\" he added, advancing a\nfew feet nigher to the immovable Hard-Heart, as if in the sincerity of\nconfidence; \"the Red-man can never want an enemy: they are plentier than\nthe leaves on the trees, the birds in the heavens, or the buffaloes on\nthe prairies. Let my brother open his eyes wide: does he no where see an\nenemy he would strike?\"\n\n\"How long is it since the Teton counted the scalps of his warriors, that\nwere drying in the smoke of a Pawnee lodge? The hand that took them is\nhere, and ready to make eighteen, twenty.\"\n\n\"Now, let not the mind of my brother go on a crooked path. If a Red-skin\nstrikes a Red-skin for ever, who will be masters of the prairies, when\nno warriors are left to say, 'They are mine?' Hear the voices of the old\nmen. They tell us that in their days many Indians have come out of the\nwoods under the rising sun, and that they have filled the prairies with\ntheir complaints of the robberies of the Long-knives. Where a Pale-face\ncomes, a Red-man cannot stay. The land is too small. They are always\nhungry. See, they are here already!\"\n\nAs the Teton spoke, he pointed towards the tents of Ishmael, which were\nin plain sight, and then he paused, to await the effect of his words on\nthe mind of his ingenuous foe. Hard-Heart listened like one in whom a\ntrain of novel ideas had been excited by the reasoning of the other. He\nmused for a minute before he demanded--\n\n\"What do the wise chiefs of the Sioux say must be done?\"\n\n\"They think that the moccasin of every Pale-face should be followed,\nlike the track of the bear. That the Long-knife, who comes upon the\nprairie, should never go back. That the path shall be open to those who\ncome, and shut to those who go. Yonder are many. They have horses and\nguns. They are rich, but we are poor. Will the Pawnees meet the Tetons\nin council? and when the sun is gone behind the Rocky Mountains, they\nwill say, This is for a Loup and this for a Sioux.\"\n\n\"Teton--no! Hard-Heart has never struck the stranger. They come into\nhis lodge and eat, and they go out in safety. A mighty chief is their\nfriend! When my people call the young men to go on the war-path, the\nmoccasin of Hard-Heart is the last. But his village is no sooner hid by\nthe trees, than it is the first. No, Teton; his arm will never be lifted\nagainst the stranger.\"\n\n\"Fool; die, with empty hands!\" Mahtoree exclaimed, setting an arrow to\nhis bow, and sending it, with a sudden and deadly aim, full at the naked\nbosom of his generous and confiding enemy.\n\nThe action of the treacherous Teton was too quick, and too well matured,\nto admit of any of the ordinary means of defence on the part of the\nPawnee. His shield was hanging at his shoulder, and even the arrow had\nbeen suffered to fall from its place, and lay in the hollow of the hand\nwhich grasped his bow. But the quick eye of the brave had time to see\nthe movement, and his ready thoughts did not desert him. Pulling hard\nand with a jerk upon the rein, his steed reared his forward legs into\nthe air, and, as the rider bent his body low, the horse served for\na shield against the danger. So true, however, was the aim, and so\npowerful the force by which it was sent, that the arrow entered the neck\nof the animal, and broke the skin on the opposite side.\n\nQuicker than thought Hard-Heart sent back an answering arrow. The shield\nof the Teton was transfixed, but his person was untouched. For a few\nmoments the twang of the bow and the glancing of arrows were incessant,\nnotwithstanding the combatants were compelled to give so large a portion\nof their care to the means of defence. The quivers were soon exhausted;\nand though blood had been drawn, it was not in sufficient quantities to\nimpair the energy of the combat.\n\nA series of masterly and rapid evolutions with the horses now commenced.\nThe wheelings, the charges, the advances, and the circuitous retreats,\nwere like the flights of circling swallows. Blows were struck with the\nlance, the sand was scattered in the air, and the shocks often seemed to\nbe unavoidably fatal; but still each party kept his seat, and still each\nrein was managed with a steady hand. At length the Teton was driven to\nthe necessity of throwing himself from his horse, to escape a thrust\nthat would otherwise have proved fatal. The Pawnee passed his lance\nthrough the beast, uttering a shout of triumph as he galloped by.\nTurning in his tracks, he was about to push the advantage, when his own\nmettled steed staggered and fell, under a burden that he could no longer\nsustain. Mahtoree answered his premature cry of victory, and rushed\nupon the entangled youth, with knife and tomahawk. The utmost agility\nof Hard-Heart had not sufficed to extricate himself in season from the\nfallen beast. He saw that his case was desperate. Feeling for his knife,\nhe took the blade between a finger and thumb, and cast it with admirable\ncoolness at his advancing foe. The keen weapon whirled a few times in\nthe air, and its point meeting the naked breast of the impetuous Sioux,\nthe blade was buried to the buck-horn haft.\n\nMahtoree laid his hand on the weapon, and seemed to hesitate whether to\nwithdraw it or not. For a moment his countenance darkened with the\nmost inextinguishable hatred and ferocity, and then, as if inwardly\nadmonished how little time he had to lose, he staggered to the edge\nof the sands, and halted with his feet in the water. The cunning and\nduplicity, which had so long obscured the brighter and nobler traits of\nhis character, were lost in the never dying sentiment of pride, which he\nhad imbibed in youth.\n\n\"Boy of the Loups!\" he said with a smile of grim satisfaction, \"the\nscalp of a mighty Dahcotah shall never dry in Pawnee smoke!\"\n\nDrawing the knife from the wound, he hurled it towards the enemy\nin disdain. Then shaking his arm at his successful foe, his swarthy\ncountenance appearing to struggle with volumes of scorn and hatred, that\nhe could not utter with the tongue, he cast himself headlong into one\nof the most rapid veins of the current, his hand still waving in triumph\nabove the fluid, even after his body had sunk into the tide for ever.\nHard-Heart was by this time free. The silence, which had hitherto\nreigned in the bands, was suddenly broken by general and tumultuous\nshouts. Fifty of the adverse warriors were already in the river,\nhastening to destroy or to defend the conqueror, and the combat was\nrather on the eve of its commencement than near its termination. But to\nall these signs of danger and need, the young victor was insensible. He\nsprang for the knife, and bounded with the foot of an antelope along the\nsands, looking for the receding fluid which concealed his prize. A dark,\nbloody spot indicated the place, and, armed with the knife, he plunged\ninto the stream, resolute to die in the flood, or to return with his\ntrophy.\n\nIn the mean time, the sands became a scene of bloodshed and violence.\nBetter mounted and perhaps more ardent, the Pawnees had, however,\nreached the spot in sufficient numbers to force their enemies to retire.\nThe victors pushed their success to the opposite shore, and gained the\nsolid ground in the melee of the fight. Here they were met by all the\nunmounted Tetons, and, in their turn, they were forced to give way.\n\nThe combat now became more characteristic and circumspect. As the\nhot impulses, which had driven both parties to mingle in so deadly\na struggle, began to cool, the chiefs were enabled to exercise their\ninfluence, and to temper the assaults with prudence. In consequence of\nthe admonitions of their leaders, the Siouxes sought such covers as the\ngrass afforded, or here and there some bush or slight inequality of the\nground, and the charges of the Pawnee warriors necessarily became more\nwary, and of course less fatal.\n\nIn this manner the contest continued with a varied success, and without\nmuch loss. The Siouxes had succeeded in forcing themselves into a thick\ngrowth of rank grass, where the horses of their enemies could not\nenter, or where, when entered, they were worse than useless. It became\nnecessary to dislodge the Tetons from this cover, or the object of the\ncombat must be abandoned. Several desperate efforts had been repulsed,\nand the disheartened Pawnees were beginning to think of a retreat, when\nthe well-known war-cry of Hard-Heart was heard at hand, and at the next\ninstant the chief appeared in their centre, flourishing the scalp of the\nGreat Sioux, as a banner that would lead to victory.\n\nHe was greeted by a shout of delight, and followed into the cover, with\nan impetuosity that, for the moment, drove all before it. But the\nbloody trophy in the hand of the partisan served as an incentive to the\nattacked, as well as to the assailants. Mahtoree had left many a daring\nbrave behind him in his band, and the orator, who in the debates of\nthat day had manifested such pacific thoughts, now exhibited the most\ngenerous self-devotion, in order to wrest the memorial of a man he had\nnever loved, from the hands of the avowed enemies of his people.\n\nThe result was in favour of numbers. After a severe struggle, in which\nthe finest displays of personal intrepidity were exhibited by all the\nchiefs, the Pawnees were compelled to retire upon the open bottom,\nclosely pressed by the Siouxes, who failed not to seize each foot of\nground ceded by their enemies. Had the Tetons stayed their efforts on\nthe margin of the grass, it is probable that the honour of the day\nwould have been theirs, notwithstanding the irretrievable loss they had\nsustained in the death of Mahtoree. But the more reckless braves of the\nband were guilty of an indiscretion, that entirely changed the\nfortunes of the fight, and suddenly stripped them of their hard-earned\nadvantages.\n\nA Pawnee chief had sunk under the numerous wounds he had received, and\nhe fell, a target for a dozen arrows, in the very last group of his\nretiring party. Regardless alike of inflicting further injury on their\nfoes, and of the temerity of the act, the Sioux braves bounded forward\nwith a whoop, each man burning with the wish to reap the high renown of\nstriking the body of the dead. They were met by Hard-Heart and a chosen\nknot of warriors, all of whom were just as stoutly bent on saving the\nhonour of their nation, from so foul a stain. The struggle was hand to\nhand, and blood began to flow more freely. As the Pawnees retired with\nthe body, the Siouxes pressed upon their footsteps, and at length the\nwhole of the latter broke out of the cover with a common yell, and\nthreatened to bear down all opposition by sheer physical superiority.\n\nThe fate of Hard-Heart and his companions, all of whom would have died\nrather than relinquish their object, would have been quickly sealed, but\nfor a powerful and unlooked-for interposition in their favour. A shout\nwas heard from a little brake on the left, and a volley from the fatal\nwestern rifle immediately succeeded. Some five or six Siouxes leaped\nforward in the death agony, and every arm among them was as suddenly\nsuspended, as if the lightning had flashed from the clouds to aid the\ncause of the Loups. Then came Ishmael and his stout sons in open view,\nbearing down upon their late treacherous allies, with looks and voices\nthat proclaimed the character of the succour.\n\nThe shock was too much for the fortitude of the Tetons. Several of\ntheir bravest chiefs had already fallen, and those that remained were\ninstantly abandoned by the whole of the inferior herd. A few of the most\ndesperate braves still lingered nigh the fatal symbol of their honour,\nand there nobly met their deaths, under the blows of the re-encouraged\nPawnees. A second discharge from the rifles of the squatter and his\nparty completed the victory.\n\nThe Siouxes were now to be seen flying to more distant covers, with the\nsame eagerness and desperation as, a few moments before, they had been\nplunging into the fight. The triumphant Pawnees bounded forward in\nchase, like so many high-blooded and well-trained hounds. On every side\nwere heard the cries of victory, or the yell of revenge. A few of the\nfugitives endeavoured to bear away the bodies of their fallen warriors,\nbut the hot pursuit quickly compelled them to abandon the slain, in\norder to preserve the living. Among all the struggles, which were made\non that occasion, to guard the honour of the Siouxes from the stain\nwhich their peculiar opinions attached to the possession of the scalp of\na fallen brave, but one solitary instance of success occurred.\n\nThe opposition of a particular chief to the hostile proceedings in the\ncouncils of that morning has been already seen. But, after having raised\nhis voice in vain, in support of peace, his arm was not backward in\ndoing its duty in the war. His prowess has been mentioned; and it was\nchiefly by his courage and example, that the Tetons sustained themselves\nin the heroic manner they did, when the death of Mahtoree was known.\nThis warrior, who, in the figurative language of his people, was called\n\"the Swooping Eagle,\" had been the last to abandon the hopes of victory.\nWhen he found that the support of the dreaded rifle had robbed his band\nof the hard-earned advantages, he sullenly retired amid a shower of\nmissiles, to the secret spot where he had hid his horse, in the mazes\nof the highest grass. Here he found a new and an entirely unexpected\ncompetitor, ready to dispute with him for the possession of the beast.\nIt was Bohrecheena, the aged friend of Mahtoree; he whose voice had been\ngiven in opposition to his own wiser opinions, transfixed with an arrow,\nand evidently suffering under the pangs of approaching death.\n\n\"I have been on my last war-path,\" said the grim old warrior, when he\nfound that the real owner of the animal had come to claim his property;\n\"shall a Pawnee carry the white hairs of a Sioux into his village, to be\na scorn to his women and children?\"\n\nThe other grasped his hand, answering to the appeal with the stern\nlook of inflexible resolution. With this silent pledge, he assisted the\nwounded man to mount. So soon as he had led the horse to the margin of\nthe cover, he threw himself also on its back, and securing his companion\nto his belt, he issued on the open plain, trusting entirely to the\nwell-known speed of the beast for their mutual safety. The Pawnees were\nnot long in catching a view of these new objects, and several turned\ntheir steeds to pursue. The race continued for a mile without a murmur\nfrom the sufferer, though in addition to the agony of his body, he had\nthe pain of seeing his enemies approach at every leap of their horses.\n\n\"Stop,\" he said, raising a feeble arm to check the speed of his\ncompanion; \"the Eagle of my tribe must spread his wings wider. Let him\ncarry the white hairs of an old warrior into the burnt-wood village!\"\n\nFew words were necessary, between men who were governed by the same\nfeelings of glory, and who were so well trained in the principles of\ntheir romantic honour. The Swooping Eagle threw himself from the back\nof the horse, and assisted the other to alight. The old man raised his\ntottering frame to its knees, and first casting a glance upward at the\ncountenance of his countryman, as if to bid him adieu, he stretched out\nhis neck to the blow he himself invited. A few strokes of the tomahawk,\nwith a circling gash of the knife, sufficed to sever the head from the\nless valued trunk. The Teton mounted again, just in season to escape a\nflight of arrows which came from his eager and disappointed pursuers.\nFlourishing the grim and bloody visage, he darted away from the spot\nwith a shout of triumph, and was seen scouring the plains, as if he\nwere actually borne along on the wings of the powerful bird from whose\nqualities he had received his flattering name. The Swooping Eagle\nreached his village in safety. He was one of the few Siouxes who escaped\nfrom the massacre of that fatal day; and for a long time he alone of the\nsaved was able to lift his voice, in the councils of his nation, with\nundiminished confidence.\n\nThe knife and the lance cut short the retreat of the larger portion of\nthe vanquished. Even the retiring party of the women and children\nwere scattered by the conquerors; and the sun had long sunk behind the\nrolling outline of the western horizon, before the fell business of that\ndisastrous defeat was entirely ended.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n            Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nThe day dawned, the following morning, on a more, tranquil scene. The\nwork of blood had entirely ceased; and as the sun arose, its light was\nshed on a broad expanse of quiet and solitude. The tents of Ishmael were\nstill standing, where they had been last seen, but not another vestige\nof human existence could be traced in any other part of the waste. Here\nand there little flocks of ravenous birds were sailing and screaming\nabove those spots where some heavy-footed Teton had met his death, but\nevery other sign of the recent combat had passed away. The river was to\nbe traced far through the endless meadows, by its serpentine and smoking\nbed; and the little silvery clouds of vapour, which hung above the pools\nand springs, were beginning to melt in air, as they felt the quickening\nwarmth, which, pouring from the glowing sky, shed its bland and subtle\ninfluence on every object of the vast and unshadowed region. The prairie\nwas like the heavens after the passage of the gust, soft, calm, and\nsoothing.\n\nIt was in the midst of such a scene that the family of the squatter\nassembled to make their final decision, concerning the several\nindividuals who had been thrown into their power, by the fluctuating\nchances of the incidents related. Every being possessing life and\nliberty had been afoot, since the first streak of grey had lighted the\neast; and even the youngest of the erratic brood seemed conscious that\nthe moment had arrived, when circumstances were about to transpire\nthat might leave a lasting impression on the wild fortunes of their\nsemi-barbarous condition.\n\nIshmael moved through his little encampment, with the seriousness of one\nwho had been unexpectedly charged with matters of a gravity, exceeding\nany of the ordinary occurrences of his irregular existence. His sons\nhowever, who had so often found occasions to prove the inexorable\nseverity of their father's character, saw, in his sullen mien and cold\neye, rather a determination to adhere to his resolutions, which usually\nwere as obstinately enforced as they were harshly conceived, than any\nevidences of wavering or doubt. Even Esther was sensibly affected by\nthe important matters that pressed so heavily on the interests of her\nfamily. While she neglected none of those domestic offices, which would\nprobably have proceeded under any conceivable circumstances, just as\nthe world turns round with earthquakes rending its crust and volcanoes\nconsuming its vitals, yet her voice was pitched to a lower and more\nforeboding key than common, and the still frequent chidings of her\nchildren were tempered by something like the milder dignity of parental\nauthority.\n\nAbiram, as usual, seemed the one most given to solicitude and doubt.\nThere were certain misgivings, in the frequent glances that he turned\non the unyielding countenance of Ishmael, which might have betrayed how\nlittle of their former confidence and good understanding existed between\nthem. His looks appeared to be vacillating between hope and fear. At\ntimes, his countenance lighted with the gleamings of a sordid joy, as\nhe bent his look on the tent which contained his recovered prisoner,\nand then, again, the impression seemed unaccountably chased away by the\nshadows of intense apprehension. When under the influence of the\nlatter feeling, his eye never failed to seek the visage of his dull and\nimpenetrable kinsman. But there he rather found reason for alarm than\ngrounds of encouragement, for the whole character of the squatter's\ncountenance expressed the fearful truth, that he had redeemed his dull\nfaculties from the influence of the kidnapper, and that his thoughts\nwere now brooding only on the achievement of his own stubborn\nintentions.\n\nIt was in this state of things that the sons of Ishmael, in obedience\nto an order from their father, conducted the several subjects of his\ncontemplated decisions, from their places of confinement into the open\nair. No one was exempted from this arrangement. Middleton and Inez, Paul\nand Ellen, Obed and the trapper, were all brought forth and placed in\nsituations that were deemed suitable to receive the sentence of their\narbitrary judge. The younger children gathered around the spot, in\nmomentary but engrossing curiosity, and even Esther quitted her culinary\nlabours, and drew nigh to listen.\n\nHard-Heart alone, of all his band, was present to witness the novel and\nfar from unimposing spectacle. He stood leaning, gravely, on his lance,\nwhile the smoking steed, that grazed nigh, showed that he had ridden far\nand hard to be a spectator, on the occasion.\n\nIshmael had received his new ally with a coldness that showed his entire\ninsensibility to that delicacy, which had induced the young chief to\ncome alone, in order that the presence of his warriors might not create\nuneasiness, or distrust. He neither courted their assistance, nor\ndreaded their enmity, and he now proceeded to the business of the hour\nwith as much composure, as if the species of patriarchal power, he\nwielded, was universally recognised.\n\nThere is something elevating in the possession of authority, however it\nmay be abused. The mind is apt to make some efforts to prove the fitness\nbetween its qualities and the condition of its owner, though it may\noften fail, and render that ridiculous which was only hated before. But\nthe effect on Ishmael Bush was not so disheartening. Grave in exterior,\nsaturnine by temperament, formidable by his physical means, and\ndangerous from his lawless obstinacy, his self-constituted tribunal\nexcited a degree of awe, to which even the intelligent Middleton could\nnot bring himself to be entirely insensible. Little time, however, was\ngiven to arrange his thoughts; for the squatter, though unaccustomed to\nhaste, having previously made up his mind, was not disposed to waste the\nmoments in delay. When he saw that all were in their places, he cast a\ndull look over his prisoners, and addressed himself to the Captain, as\nthe principal man among the imaginary delinquents.\n\n\"I am called upon this day, to fill the office which in the settlements\nyou give unto judges, who are set apart to decide on matters that arise\nbetween man and man. I have but little knowledge of the ways of the\ncourts, though there is a rule that is known unto all, and which\nteaches, that an 'eye must be returned for an eye,' and a 'tooth for\na tooth.' I am no troubler of countyhouses, and least of all do I like\nliving on a plantation that the sheriff has surveyed; yet there is\na reason in such a law, that makes it a safe rule to journey by, and\ntherefore it ar' a solemn fact that this day shall I abide by it, and\ngive unto all and each that which is his due and no more.\"\n\nWhen Ishmael had delivered his mind thus far, he paused and looked\nabout him, as if he would trace the effects in the countenances of his\nhearers. When his eye met that of Middleton, he was answered by the\nlatter--\n\n\"If the evil-doer is to be punished, and he that has offended none to\nbe left to go at large, you must change situations with me, and become a\nprisoner instead of a judge.\"\n\n\"You mean to say that I have done you wrong, in taking the lady from her\nfather's house, and leading her so far against her will into these wild\ndistricts,\" returned the unmoved squatter, who manifested as little\nresentment as he betrayed compunction at the charge. \"I shall not put\nthe lie on the back of an evil deed, and deny your words. Since things\nhave come to this pass between us, I have found time to think the matter\nover at my leisure, and though none of your swift thinkers, who can see,\nor who pretend to see, into the nature of all things, by a turn of the\neye, yet am I a man open to reason, and give me my time, one who is not\ngiven to deny the truth. Therefore have I mainly concluded, that it\nwas a mistake to take a child from its parent, and the lady shall be\nreturned whence she has been brought, as tenderly and as safely as man\ncan do it.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" added Esther, \"the man is right. Poverty and labour bore hard\nupon him, especially as county officers were getting troublesome, and\nin a weak moment he did the wicked act; but he has listened to my words,\nand his mind has got round again into its honest corner. An awful and a\ndangerous thing it is to be bringing the daughters of other people into\na peaceable and well-governed family!\"\n\n\"And who will thank you for the same, after what has been already\ndone?\" muttered Abiram, with a grin of disappointed cupidity, in which\nmalignity and terror were disgustingly united; \"when the devil has once\nmade out his account, you may look for your receipt in full only at his\nhands.\"\n\n\"Peace!\" said Ishmael, stretching his heavy hand towards his kinsman,\nin a manner that instantly silenced the speaker. \"Your voice is like a\nraven's in my ears. If you had never spoken, I should have been spared\nthis shame.\"\n\n\"Since then you are beginning to lose sight of your errors, and to\nsee the truth,\" said Middleton, \"do not things by halves, but, by\nthe generosity of your conduct, purchase friends who may be of use in\nwarding off any future danger from the law--\"\n\n\"Young man,\" interrupted the squatter, with a dark frown, \"you, too,\nhave said enough. If fear of the law had come over me, you would not be\nhere to witness the manner in which Ishmael Bush deals out justice.\"\n\n\"Smother not your good intentions; and remember, if you contemplate\nviolence to any among us, that the arm of that law you affect to\ndespise, reaches far, and that though its movements are sometimes slow,\nthey are not the less certain!\"\n\n\"Yes, there is too much truth in his words, squatter,\" said the trapper,\nwhose attentive ears rarely suffered a syllable to be utterly unheeded\nin his presence. \"A busy and a troublesome arm it often proves to be\nhere, in this land of America; where, as they say, man is left greatly\nto the following of his own wishes, compared to other countries;\nand happier, ay, and more manly and more honest, too, is he for the\nprivilege! Why do you know, my men, that there are regions where the law\nis so busy as to say, In this fashion shall you live, in that fashion\nshall you die, and in such another fashion shall you take leave of the\nworld, to be sent before the judgment-seat of the Lord! A wicked and a\ntroublesome meddling is that, with the business of One who has not made\nHis creatures to be herded, like oxen, and driven from field to field,\nas their stupid and selfish keepers may judge of their need and wants.\nA miserable land must that be, where they fetter the mind as well as the\nbody, and where the creatures of God, being born children, are kept\nso by the wicked inventions of men who would take upon themselves the\noffice of the great Governor of all!\"\n\nDuring the delivery of this pertinent opinion, Ishmael was content to be\nsilent, though the look, with which he regarded the speaker, manifested\nany other feeling than that of amity. When the old man was done, he\nturned to Middleton, and continued the subject which the other had\ninterrupted.\n\n\"As to ourselves, young Captain, there has been wrong on both sides. If\nI have borne hard upon your feelings, in taking away your wife with an\nhonest intention of giving her back to you, when the plans of that devil\nincarnate were answered, so have you broken into my encampment,\naiding and abetting, as they have called many an honester bargain, in\ndestroying my property.\"\n\n\"But what I did was to liberate--\"\n\n\"The matter is settled between us,\" interrupted Ishmael, with the air of\none who, having made up his own opinion on the merits of the question,\ncared very little for those of other people; \"you and your wife are\nfree to go and come, when and how you please. Abner, set the Captain at\nliberty; and now, if you will tarry until I am ready to draw nigher to\nthe settlements, you shall both have the benefit of carriage; if not,\nnever say that you did not get a friendly offer.\"\n\n\"Now, may the strong oppress me, and my sins be visited harshly on my\nown head, if I forget your honesty, however slow it has been in showing\nitself,\" cried Middleton, hastening to the side of the weeping Inez,\nthe instant he was released; \"and, friend, I pledge you the honour of\na soldier, that your own part of this transaction shall be forgotten,\nwhatever I may deem fit to have done, when I reach a place where the arm\nof government can make itself felt.\"\n\nThe dull smile, with which the squatter answered to this assurance,\nproved how little he valued the pledge that the youth, in the first\nrevulsion of his feelings, was so free to make.\n\n\"Neither fear nor favour, but what I call justice, has brought me to\nthis judgment,\" he said, \"do you that which may seem right in your eyes,\nand believe that the world is wide enough to hold us both, without our\ncrossing each other's path again! If you ar' content, well; if you ar'\nnot content, seek to ease your feelings in your own fashion. I shall\nnot ask to be let up, when you once put me fairly down. And now, Doctor,\nhave I come to your leaf in my accounts. It is time to foot up the small\nreckoning, that has been running on, for some time, atwixt us. With you,\nI entered into open and manly faith; in what manner have you kept it?\"\n\nThe singular felicity, with which Ishmael had contrived to shift the\nresponsibility of all that had passed, from his own shoulders to those\nof his prisoners, backed as it was by circumstances that hardly admitted\nof a very philosophical examination of any mooted point in ethics,\nwas sufficiently embarrassing to the several individuals, who were\nso unexpectedly required to answer for a conduct which, in their\nsimplicity, they had deemed so meritorious. The life of Obed had been so\npurely theoretic, that his amazement was not the least embarrassing at\na state of things which might not have proved so very remarkable had\nhe been a little more practised in the ways of the world. The worthy\nnaturalist was not the first by many, who found himself, at the precise\nmoment when he was expecting praise, suddenly arraigned, to answer for\nthe very conduct on which he rested all his claims to commendation.\nThough not a little scandalised, at the unexpected turn of the\ntransaction, he was fain to make the best of circumstances, and to bring\nforth such matter in justification, as first presented itself to his\ndisordered faculties.\n\n\"That there did exist a certain compactum, or agreement, between Obed\nBatt, M.D., and Ishmael Bush, viator, or erratic husbandman,\" he\nsaid, endeavouring to avoid all offence in the use of terms, \"I am\nnot disposed to deny. I will admit that it was therein conditioned, or\nstipulated, that a certain journey should be performed conjointly, or in\ncompany, until so many days had been numbered. But as the said time has\nfully expired, I presume it fair to infer that the bargain may now be\nsaid to be obsolete.\"\n\n\"Ishmael!\" interrupted the impatient Esther, \"make no words with a man\nwho can break your bones as easily as set them, and let the poisoning\ndevil go! He's a cheat, from box to phial. Give him half the prairie,\nand take the other half yourself. He an acclimator! I will engage to\nget the brats acclimated to a fever-and-ague bottom in a week, and not\na word shall be uttered harder to pronounce than the bark of a\ncherry-tree, with perhaps a drop or two of western comfort. One thing\nar' a fact, Ishmael; I like no fellow-travellers who can give a heavy\nfeel to an honest woman's tongue, I--and that without caring whether her\nhousehold is in order, or out of order.\"\n\nThe air of settled gloom, which had taken possession of the squatter's\ncountenance, lighted for an instant with a look of dull drollery, as he\nanswered--\n\n\"Different people might judge differently, Esther, of the virtue of the\nman's art. But sin' it is your wish to let him depart, I will not plough\nthe prairie to make the walking rough. Friend, you are at liberty to go\ninto the settlements, and there I would advise you to tarry, as men like\nme who make but few contracts, do not relish the custom of breaking them\nso easily.\"\n\n\"And now, Ishmael,\" resumed his conquering wife, \"in order to keep a\nquiet family and to smother all heart-burnings between us, show yonder\nRed-skin and his daughter,\" pointing to the aged Le Balafre and the\nwidowed Tachechana, \"the way to their village, and let us say to\nthem--God bless you, and farewell, in the same breath!\"\n\n\"They are the captives of the Pawnee, according to the rules of Indian\nwarfare, and I cannot meddle with his rights.\"\n\n\"Beware the devil, my man! He's a cheat and a tempter, and none can\nsay they ar' safe with his awful delusions before their eyes! Take the\nadvice of one who has the honour of your name at heart, and send the\ntawny Jezebel away.\"\n\nThe squatter laid his broad hand on her shoulder, and looking her\nsteadily in the eye, he answered, in tones that were both stern and\nsolemn--\n\n\"Woman, we have that before us which calls our thoughts to other matters\nthan the follies you mean. Remember what is to come, and put your silly\njealousy to sleep.\"\n\n\"It is true, it is true,\" murmured his wife, moving back among her\ndaughters; \"God forgive me, that I should forget it!\"\n\n\"And now, young man; you, who have so often come into my clearing, under\nthe pretence of lining the bee into his hole,\" resumed Ishmael, after a\nmomentary pause, as if to recover the equilibrium of his mind, \"with you\nthere is a heavier account to settle. Not satisfied with rummaging\nmy camp, you have stolen a girl who is akin to my wife, and who I had\ncalculated to make one day a daughter of my own.\"\n\nA stronger sensation was produced by this, than by any of the preceding\ninterrogations. All the young men bent their curious eyes on Paul and\nEllen, the former of whom seemed in no small mental confusion, while the\nlatter bent her face on her bosom in shame.\n\n\"Harkee, friend Ishmael Bush,\" returned the bee-hunter, who found that\nhe was expected to answer to the charge of burglary, as well as to that\nof abduction; \"that I did not give the most civil treatment to your pots\nand pails, I am not going to gainsay. If you will name the price you\nput upon the articles, it is possible the damage may be quietly settled\nbetween us, and all hard feelings forgotten. I was not in a church-going\nhumour when we got upon your rock, and it is more than probable there\nwas quite as much kicking as preaching among your wares; but a hole in\nthe best man's coat can be mended by money. As to the matter of Ellen\nWade, here, it may not be got over so easily. Different people have\ndifferent opinions on the subject of matrimony. Some think it is enough\nto say yes and no, to the questions of the magistrate, or of the parson,\nif one happens to be handy, in order to make a quiet house; but I think\nthat where a young woman's mind is fairly bent on going in a certain\ndirection, it will be quite as prudent to let her body follow. Not\nthat I mean to say Ellen was not altogether forced to what she did, and\ntherefore she is just as innocent, in this matter, as yonder jackass,\nwho was made to carry her, and greatly against his will, too, as I am\nready to swear he would say himself, if he could speak as loud as he can\nbray.\"\n\n\"Nelly,\" resumed the squatter, who paid very little attention to what\nPaul considered a highly creditable and ingenious vindication, \"Nelly,\nthis is a wide and a wicked world, on which you have been in such a\nhurry to cast yourself. You have fed and you have slept in my camp for\na year, and I did hope that you had found the free air of the borders,\nenough to your mind to wish to remain among us.\"\n\n\"Let the girl have her will,\" muttered Esther, from the rear; \"he, who\nmight have persuaded her to stay, is sleeping in the cold and naked\nprairie, and little hope is left of changing her humour; besides,\na woman's mind is a wilful thing, and not easily turned from its\nwaywardness, as you know yourself, my man, or I should not be here the\nmother of your sons and daughters.\"\n\nThe squatter seemed reluctant to abandon his views of the abashed girl,\nso easily; and before he answered to the suggestion of his wife, he\nturned his usual dull look along the line of the curious countenances of\nhis boys, as if to see whether there was not one among them fit to fill\nthe place of the deceased. Paul was not slow to observe the expression,\nand hitting nigher than usual on the secret thoughts of the other,\nhe believed he had fallen on an expedient which might remove every\ndifficulty.\n\n\"It is quite plain, friend Bush,\" he said, \"that there are two opinions\nin this matter; yours for your sons, and mine for myself. I see but one\namicable way of settling this dispute, which is as follows:--do you make\na choice among your boys of any you will, and let us walk off together\nfor the matter of a few miles into the prairies; the one who stays\nbehind, can never trouble any man's house or his fixen, and the one who\ncomes back may make the best of his way he can, in the good wishes of\nthe young woman.\"\n\n\"Paul!\" exclaimed the reproachful, but smothered voice of Ellen.\n\n\"Never fear, Nelly,\" whispered the literal bee-hunter, whose\nstraight-going mind suggested no other motive of uneasiness, on the part\nof his mistress, than concern for himself; \"I have taken the measure of\nthem all, and you may trust an eye that has seen to line many a bee into\nhis hole!\"\n\n\"I am not about to set myself up as a ruler of inclinations,\" observed\nthe squatter. \"If the heart of the child is truly in the settlements,\nlet her declare it; she shall have no let or hinderance from me. Speak,\nNelly, and let what you say come from your wishes, without fear or\nfavour. Would you leave us to go with this young man into the settled\ncountries, or will you tarry and share the little we have to give, but\nwhich to you we give so freely?\"\n\nThus called upon to decide, Ellen could no longer hesitate. The glance\nof her eye was at first timid and furtive. But as the colour flushed her\nfeatures, and her breathing became quick and excited, it was apparent\nthat the native spirit of the girl was gaining the ascendency over the\nbashfulness of sex.\n\n\"You took me a fatherless, impoverished, and friendless orphan,\" she\nsaid, struggling to command her voice, \"when others, who live in what\nmay be called affluence compared to your state, chose to forget me; and\nmay Heaven in its goodness bless you for it! The little I have done,\nwill never pay you for that one act of kindness. I like not your manner\nof life; it is different from the ways of my childhood, and it is\ndifferent from my wishes; still, had you not led this sweet and\nunoffending lady from her friends, I should never have quitted you,\nuntil you yourself had said, Go, and the blessing of God go with you!'\"\n\n\"The act was not wise, but it is repented of; and so far as it can\nbe done, in safety, it shall be repaired. Now, speak freely, will you\ntarry, or will you go?\"\n\n\"I have promised the lady,\" said Ellen, dropping her eyes again to the\nearth, \"not to leave her; and after she has received so much wrong from\nour hands, she may have a right to claim that I keep my word.\"\n\n\"Take the cords from the young man,\" said Ishmael. When the order was\nobeyed, he motioned for all his sons to advance, and he placed them in\na row before the eyes of Ellen. \"Now let there be no trifling, but open\nyour heart. Here ar' all I have to offer, besides a hearty welcome.\"\n\nThe distressed girl turned her abashed look from the countenance of one\nof the young men to that of another, until her eye met the troubled and\nworking features of Paul. Then nature got the better of forms. She threw\nherself into the arms of the bee-hunter, and sufficiently proclaimed her\nchoice by sobbing aloud. Ishmael signed to his sons to fall back, and\nevidently mortified, though perhaps not disappointed by the result, he\nno longer hesitated.\n\n\"Take her,\" he said, \"and deal honestly and kindly by her. The girl has\nthat in her which should make her welcome, in any man's house, and I\nshould be loth to hear she ever came to harm. And now I have settled\nwith you all, on terms that I hope you will not find hard, but, on the\ncontrary, just and manly. I have only another question to ask, and that\nis of the Captain; do you choose to profit by my teams in going into the\nsettlements, or not?\"\n\n\"I hear, that some soldiers of my party are looking for me near the\nvillages of the Pawnees,\" said Middleton, \"and I intend to accompany\nthis chief, in order to join my men.\"\n\n\"Then the sooner we part the better. Horses are plenty on the bottom.\nGo; make your choice, and leave us in peace.\"\n\n\"That is impossible, while the old man, who has been a friend of my\nfamily near half a century, is left a prisoner. What has he done, that\nhe too is not released?\n\n\"Ask no questions that may lead to deceitful answers,\" sullenly returned\nthe squatter; \"I have dealings of my own with that trapper, that it may\nnot befit an officer of the States to meddle with. Go, while your road\nis open.\"\n\n\"The man may be giving you honest counsel, and that which it concerns\nyou all to hearken to,\" observed the old captive, who seemed in no\nuneasiness at the extraordinary condition in which he found himself.\n\"The Siouxes are a numberless and bloody-minded race, and no one can\nsay how long it may be, afore they will be out again on the scent of\nrevenge. Therefore I say to you, go, also; and take especial heed, in\ncrossing the bottoms, that you get not entangled again in the fires, for\nthe honest hunters often burn the grass at this season, in order that\nthe buffaloes may find a sweeter and a greener pasturage in the spring.\"\n\n\"I should forget not only my gratitude, but my duty to the laws, were I\nto leave this prisoner in your hands, even by his own consent, without\nknowing the nature of his crime, in which we may have all been his\ninnocent accessaries.\"\n\n\"Will it satisfy you to know, that he merits all he will receive?\"\n\n\"It will at least change my opinion of his character.\"\n\n\"Look then at this,\" said Ishmael, placing before the eyes of the\nCaptain the bullet that had been found about the person of the dead Asa;\n\"with this morsel of lead did he lay low as fine a boy as ever gave joy\nto a parent's eyes!\"\n\n\"I cannot believe that he has done this deed, unless in self-defence, or\non some justifiable provocation. That he knew of the death of your son,\nI confess, for he pointed out the brake in which the body lay, but that\nhe has wrongfully taken his life, nothing but his own acknowledgment\nshall persuade me to believe.\"\n\n\"I have lived long,\" commenced the trapper, who found, by the general\npause, that he was expected to vindicate himself from the heavy\nimputation, \"and much evil have I seen in my day. Many are the prowling\nbears and leaping panthers that I have met, fighting for the morsel\nwhich has been thrown in their way; and many are the reasoning men, that\nI have looked on striving against each other unto death, in order that\nhuman madness might also have its hour. For myself, I hope, there is no\nboasting in saying, that though my hand has been needed in putting down\nwickedness and oppression, it has never struck a blow of which its owner\nwill be ashamed to hear, at a reckoning that shall be far mightier than\nthis.\"\n\n\"If my father has taken life from one of his tribe,\" said the young\nPawnee, whose quick eye had read the meaning of what was passing, in the\nbullet and in the countenances of the others, \"let him give himself\nup to the friends of the dead, like a warrior. He is too just to need\nthongs to lead him to judgment.\"\n\n\"Boy, I hope you do me justice. If I had done the foul deed, with which\nthey charge me, I should have manhood enough to come and offer my head\nto the blow of punishment, as all good and honest Red-men do the same.\"\nThen giving his anxious Indian friend a look, to re-assure him of\nhis innocence, he turned to the rest of his attentive and interested\nlisteners, as he continued in English, \"I have a short story to tell,\nand he that believes it will believe the truth, and he that disbelieves\nit will only lead himself astray, and perhaps his neighbour too. We were\nall out-lying about your camp, friend squatter, as by this time you\nmay begin to suspect, when we found that it contained a wronged and\nimprisoned lady, with intentions neither more honest nor dishonest than\nto set her free, as in nature and justice she had a right to be. Seeing\nthat I was more skilled in scouting than the others, while they lay\nback in the cover, I was sent upon the plain, on the business of the\nreconnoitrings. You little thought that one was so nigh, who saw into\nall the circumventions of your hunt; but there was I, sometimes flat\nbehind a bush or a tuft of grass, sometimes rolling down a hill into a\nbottom, and little did you dream that your motions were watched, as the\npanther watches the drinking deer. Lord, squatter, when I was a man in\nthe pride and strength of my days, I have looked in at the tent door of\nthe enemy, and they sleeping, ay, and dreaming too, of being at home and\nin peace! I wish there was time to give you the partic--\"\n\n\"Proceed with your explanation,\" interrupted Middleton.\n\n\"Ah! and a bloody and wicked sight it was. There I lay in a low bed of\ngrass, as two of the hunters came nigh each other. Their meeting was not\ncordial, nor such as men, who meet in a desert, should give each other;\nbut I thought they would have parted in peace, until I saw one put his\nrifle to the other's back, and do what I call a treacherous and sinful\nmurder. It was a noble and a manly youth, that boy--Though the powder\nburnt his coat, he stood the shock for more than a minute, before he\nfell. Then was he brought to his knees, and a desperate and manful fight\nhe made to the brake, like a wounded bear seeking a cover!\"\n\n\"And why, in the name of heavenly justice, did you conceal this?\" cried\nMiddleton.\n\n\"What! think you, Captain, that a man, who has spent more than\nthreescore years in the wilderness, has not learned the virtue of\ndiscretion. What red warrior runs to tell the sights he has seen, until\na fitting time? I took the Doctor to the place, in order to see whether\nhis skill might not come in use; and our friend, the bee-hunter, being\nin company, was knowing to the fact that the bushes held the body.\"\n\n\"Ay; it ar' true,\" said Paul; \"but not knowing what private reasons\nmight make the old trapper wish to hush the matter up, I said as little\nabout the thing as possible, which was just nothing at all.\"\n\n\"And who was the perpetrator of this deed?\" demanded Middleton.\n\n\"If by perpetrator you mean him who did the act, yonder stands the man;\nand a shame, and a disgrace is it to our race, that he is of the blood\nand family of the dead.\"\n\n\"He lies! he lies!\" shrieked Abiram. \"I did no murder; I gave but blow\nfor blow.\"\n\nThe voice of Ishmael was deep, and even awful, as he answered--\n\n\"It is enough. Let the old man go. Boys, put the brother of your mother\nin his place.\"\n\n\"Touch me not!\" cried Abiram. \"I'll call on God to curse you if you\ntouch me!\"\n\nThe wild and disordered gleam of his eye, at first induced the young men\nto arrest their steps; but when Abner, older and more resolute than\nthe rest, advanced full upon him, with a countenance that bespoke the\nhostile state of his mind, the affrighted criminal turned, and, making\nan abortive effort to fly, fell with his face to the earth, to all\nappearance perfectly dead. Amid the low exclamations of horror which\nsucceeded, Ishmael made a gesture which commanded his sons to bear the\nbody into the tent.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, turning to those who were strangers in his camp,\n\"nothing is left to be done, but for each to go his own road. I wish you\nall well; and to you, Ellen, though you may not prize the gift, I say,\nGod bless you!\"\n\nMiddleton, awe-struck by what he believed a manifest judgment of Heaven,\nmade no further resistance, but prepared to depart. The arrangements\nwere brief, and soon completed. When they were all ready, they took\na short and silent leave of the squatter and his family; and then the\nwhole of the singularly constituted party were seen slowly and silently\nfollowing the victorious Pawnee towards his distant villages.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n                       And I beseech you,\n               Wrest once the law, to your authority:\n               To do a great right, do a little wrong.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nIshmael awaited long and patiently for the motley train of Hard-Heart\nto disappear. When his scout reported that the last straggler of the\nIndians, who had joined their chief so soon as he was at such a distance\nfrom the encampment as to excite no jealousy by their numbers, had gone\nbehind the most distant swell of the prairie, he gave forth the order to\nstrike his tents. The cattle were already in the gears, and the movables\nwere soon transferred to their usual places in the different vehicles.\nWhen all these arrangements were completed, the little wagon, which had\nso long been the tenement of Inez, was drawn before the tent, into which\nthe insensible body of the kidnapper had been borne, and preparations\nwere evidently made for the reception of another prisoner. Then it was,\nas Abiram appeared, pale, terrified, and tottering beneath a load\nof detected guilt, that the younger members of the family were first\napprised that he still belonged to the class of the living. A general\nand superstitious impression had spread among them, that his crime had\nbeen visited by a terrible retribution from Heaven; and they now gazed\nat him, as at a being who belonged rather to another world, than as a\nmortal, who, like themselves, had still to endure the last agony before\nthe great link of human existence could be broken. The criminal himself\nappeared to be in a state, in which the most sensitive and startling\nterror was singularly combined with total physical apathy. The\ntruth was, that while his person had been numbed by the shock, his\nsusceptibility to apprehension kept his agitated mind in unrelieved\ndistress. When he found himself in the open air, he looked about him,\nin order to gather, if possible, some evidences of his future fate, from\nthe countenances of those gathered round. Seeing every where grave but\ncomposed features, and meeting in no eye any expression that threatened\nimmediate violence, the miserable man began to revive; and, by the time\nhe was seated in the wagon, his artful faculties were beginning to plot\nthe expedients of parrying the just resentment of his kinsmen, or, if\nthese should fail him, the means of escaping from a punishment that his\nforebodings told him would be terrible.\n\nThroughout the whole of these preparations Ishmael rarely spoke. A\ngesture, or a glance of the eye, served to indicate his pleasure to\nhis sons, and with these simple methods of communication, all parties\nappeared content. When the signal was made to proceed, the squatter\nthrew his rifle into the hollow of his arm, and his axe across his\nshoulder, taking the lead as usual. Esther buried herself in the wagon\nwhich contained her daughters; the young men took their customary places\namong the cattle, or nigh the teams, and the whole proceeded, at their\nordinary, dull, but unremitted gait.\n\nFor the first time, in many a day, the squatter turned his back towards\nthe setting sun. The route he held was in the direction of the settled\ncountry, and the manner in which he moved sufficed to tell his children,\nwho had learned to read their father's determinations in his mien, that\ntheir journey on the prairie was shortly to have an end. Still nothing\nelse transpired for hours, that might denote the existence of any\nsudden, or violent, revolution in the purposes or feelings of Ishmael.\nDuring all that time he marched alone, keeping a few hundred rods in\nfront of his teams, seldom giving any sign of extraordinary excitement.\nOnce or twice, indeed, his huge figure was seen standing on the summit\nof some distant swell, with the head bent towards the earth, as he\nleaned on his rifle; but then these moments of intense thought were\nrare, and of short continuance. The train had long thrown its shadows\ntowards the east, before any material alteration was made in the\ndisposition of their march. Water-courses were waded, plains were\npassed, and rolling ascents risen and descended, without producing the\nsmallest change. Long practised in the difficulties of that peculiar\nspecies of travelling in which he was engaged, the squatter avoided\nthe more impracticable obstacles of their route by a sort of instinct,\ninvariably inclining to the right or left in season, as the formation of\nthe land, the presence of trees, or the signs of rivers forewarned him\nof the necessity of such movements.\n\nAt length the hour arrived when charity to man and beast required a\ntemporary suspension of labour. Ishmael chose the required spot with his\ncustomary sagacity. The regular formation of the country, such as it\nhas been described in the earlier pages of our book, had long been\ninterrupted by a more unequal and broken surface. There were, it is\ntrue, in general, the same wide and empty wastes, the same rich and\nextensive bottoms, and that wild and singular combination of swelling\nfields and of nakedness, which gives that region the appearance of\nan ancient country, incomprehensibly stripped of its people and their\ndwellings. But these distinguishing features of the rolling prairies had\nlong been interrupted by irregular hillocks, occasional masses of rock,\nand broad belts of forest.\n\nIshmael chose a spring, that broke out of the base of a rock some forty\nor fifty feet in elevation, as a place well suited to the wants of his\nherds. The water moistened a small swale that lay beneath the spot,\nwhich yielded, in return for the fecund gift, a scanty growth of grass.\nA solitary willow had taken root in the alluvion, and profiting by its\nexclusive possession of the soil, the tree had sent up its stem far\nabove the crest of the adjacent rock, whose peaked summit had once\nbeen shadowed by its branches. But its loveliness had gone with the\nmysterious principle of life. As if in mockery of the meagre show of\nverdure that the spot exhibited, it remained a noble and solemn monument\nof former fertility. The larger, ragged, and fantastic branches still\nobtruded themselves abroad, while the white and hoary trunk stood naked\nand tempest-riven. Not a leaf, nor a sign of vegetation, was to be seen\nabout it. In all things it proclaimed the frailty of existence, and the\nfulfilment of time.\n\nHere Ishmael, after making the customary signal for the train to\napproach, threw his vast frame upon the earth, and seemed to muse on the\ndeep responsibility of his present situation. His sons were not long in\narriving; for the cattle no sooner scented the food and water than they\nquickened their pace, and then succeeded the usual bustle and avocations\nof a halt.\n\nThe impression made by the scene of that morning was not so deep, or\nlasting, on the children of Ishmael and Esther, as to induce them to\nforget the wants of nature. But while the sons were searching among\ntheir stores, for something substantial to appease their hunger, and the\nyounger fry were wrangling about their simple dishes, the parents of the\nunnurtured family were differently employed.\n\nWhen the squatter saw that all, even to the reviving Abiram, were busy\nin administering to their appetites, he gave his downcast partner a\nglance of his eye, and withdrew towards a distant roll of the land,\nwhich bounded the view towards the east. The meeting of the pair, in\nthis naked spot, was like an interview held above the grave of their\nmurdered son. Ishmael signed to his wife to take a seat beside him on a\nfragment of rock, and then followed a space, during which neither seemed\ndisposed to speak.\n\n\"We have journeyed together long, through good and bad,\" Ishmael at\nlength commenced: \"much have we had to try us, and some bitter cups have\nwe been made to swallow, my woman; but nothing like this has ever before\nlain in my path.\"\n\n\"It is a heavy cross for a poor, misguided, and sinful woman to bear!\"\nreturned Esther, bowing her head to her knees, and partly concealing her\nface in her dress. \"A heavy and a burdensome weight is this to be laid\nupon the shoulders of a sister and a mother!\"\n\n\"Ay; therein lies the hardship of the case. I had brought my mind to the\npunishment of that houseless trapper, with no great strivings, for\nthe man had done me few favours, and God forgive me if I suspected him\nwrongfully of much evil! This is, however, bringing shame in at one door\nof my cabin, in order to drive it out at the other. But shall a son of\nmine be murdered, and he who did it go at large?--the boy would never\nrest!\"\n\n\"Oh, Ishmael, we pushed the matter far. Had little been said, who would\nhave been the wiser? Our consciences might then have been quiet.\"\n\n\"Eest'er,\" said the husband, turning on her a reproachful but still a\ndull regard, \"the hour has been, my woman, when you thought another hand\nhad done this wickedness.\"\n\n\"I did, I did the Lord gave me the feeling, as a punishment for my sins!\nbut his mercy was not slow in lifting the veil; I looked into the book,\nIshmael, and there I found the words of comfort.\"\n\n\"Have you that book at hand, woman; it may happen to advise in such a\ndreary business.\"\n\nEsther fumbled in her pocket, and was not long in producing the fragment\nof a Bible, which had been thumbed and smoke-dried till the print was\nnearly illegible. It was the only article, in the nature of a book,\nthat was to be found among the chattels of the squatter, and it had been\npreserved by his wife, as a melancholy relic of more prosperous, and\npossibly of more innocent, days. She had long been in the habit of\nresorting to it, under the pressure of such circumstances as were\npalpably beyond human redress, though her spirit and resolution rarely\nneeded support under those that admitted of reparation through any of\nthe ordinary means of reprisal. In this manner Esther had made a sort\nof convenient ally of the word of God; rarely troubling it for counsel,\nhowever, except when her own incompetency to avert an evil was too\napparent to be disputed. We shall leave casuists to determine how\nfar she resembled any other believers in this particular, and proceed\ndirectly with the matter before us.\n\n\"There are many awful passages in these pages, Ishmael,\" she said, when\nthe volume was opened, and the leaves were slowly turning under her\nfinger, \"and some there ar' that teach the rules of punishment.\"\n\nHer husband made a gesture for her to find one of those brief rules of\nconduct, which have been received among all Christian nations as the\ndirect mandates of the Creator, and which have been found so just, that\neven they, who deny their high authority, admit their wisdom. Ishmael\nlistened with grave attention, as his companion read all those verses,\nwhich her memory suggested, and which were thought applicable to the\nsituation in which they found themselves. He made her show him the\nwords, which he regarded with a sort of strange reverence. A resolution\nonce taken was usually irrevocable, in one who was moved with so much\ndifficulty. He put his hand upon the book, and closed the pages himself,\nas much as to apprise his wife that he was satisfied. Esther, who so\nwell knew his character, trembled at the action, and casting a glance at\nhis steady eye, she said--\n\n\"And yet, Ishmael, my blood, and the blood of my children, is in his\nveins, cannot mercy be shown?\"\n\n\"Woman,\" he answered sternly, \"when we believed that miserable old\ntrapper had done this deed, nothing was said of mercy!\"\n\nEsther made no reply, but folding her arms upon her breast, she sat\nsilent and thoughtful for many minutes. Then she once more turned her\nanxious gaze upon the countenance of her husband, where she found all\npassion and care apparently buried in the coldest apathy. Satisfied now,\nthat the fate of her brother was sealed, and possibly conscious how well\nhe merited the punishment that was meditated, she no longer thought\nof mediation. No more words passed between them. Their eyes met for an\ninstant, and then both arose and walked in profound silence towards the\nencampment.\n\nThe squatter found his children expecting his return in the usual\nlistless manner with which they awaited all coming events. The cattle\nwere already herded, and the horses in their gears, in readiness to\nproceed, so soon as he should indicate that such was his pleasure. The\nchildren were already in their proper vehicle, and, in short, nothing\ndelayed the departure but the absence of the parents of the wild brood.\n\n\"Abner,\" said the father, with the deliberation with which all his\nproceedings were characterised, \"take the brother of your mother from\nthe wagon, and let him stand on the 'arth.\"\n\nAbiram issued from his place of concealment, trembling, it is true, but\nfar from destitute of hopes, as to his final success in appeasing the\njust resentment of his kinsman. After throwing a glance around him, with\nthe vain wish of finding a single countenance in which he might detect\na solitary gleam of sympathy, he endeavoured to smother those\napprehensions, that were by this time reviving in their original\nviolence, by forcing a sort of friendly communication between himself\nand the squatter--\n\n\"The beasts are getting jaded, brother,\" he said, \"and as we have made\nso good a march already, is it not time to camp. To my eye you may go\nfar, before a better place than this is found to pass the night in.\"\n\n\"Tis well you like it. Your tarry here ar' likely to be long. My sons,\ndraw nigh and listen. Abiram White,\" he added, lifting his cap, and\nspeaking with a solemnity and steadiness, that rendered even his dull\nmien imposing, \"you have slain my first-born, and according to the laws\nof God and man must you die!\"\n\nThe kidnapper started at this terrible and sudden sentence, with the\nterror that one would exhibit who unexpectedly found himself in the\ngrasp of a monster, from whose power there was no retreat. Although\nfilled with the most serious forebodings of what might be his lot, his\ncourage had not been equal to look his danger in the face, and with the\ndeceitful consolation, with which timid tempers are apt to conceal their\ndesperate condition from themselves, he had rather courted a treacherous\nrelief in his cunning, than prepared himself for the worst.\n\n\"Die!\" he repeated, in a voice that scarcely issued from his chest; \"a\nman is surely safe among his kinsmen!\"\n\n\"So thought my boy,\" returned the squatter, motioning for the team, that\ncontained his wife and the girls, to proceed, as he very coolly examined\nthe priming of his piece. \"By the rifle did you destroy my son; it is\nfit and just that you meet your end by the same weapon.\"\n\nAbiram stared about him with a gaze that bespoke an unsettled reason. He\neven laughed, as if he would not only persuade himself but others that\nwhat he heard was some pleasantry, intended to try his nerves. But\nnowhere did his frightful merriment meet with an answering echo. All\naround was solemn and still. The visages of his nephews were excited,\nbut cold towards him, and that of his former confederate frightfully\ndetermined. This very steadiness of mien was a thousand times more\nalarming and hopeless than any violence could have proved. The latter\nmight possibly have touched his spirit and awakened resistance, but the\nformer threw him entirely on the feeble resources of himself.\n\n\"Brother,\" he said, in a hurried, unnatural whisper, \"did I hear you?\"\n\n\"My words are plain, Abiram White: thou hast done murder, and for the\nsame must thou die!\"\n\n\"Esther! sister, sister, will you leave me! Oh sister! do you hear my\ncall?\"\n\n\"I hear one speak from the grave!\" returned the husky tones of Esther,\nas the wagon passed the spot where the criminal stood. \"It is the voice\nof my firstborn, calling aloud for justice! God have mercy, God have\nmercy, on your soul!\"\n\nThe team slowly pursued its route, and the deserted Abiram now found\nhimself deprived of the smallest vestige of hope. Still he could not\nsummon fortitude to meet his death, and had not his limbs refused to aid\nhim, he would yet have attempted to fly. Then, by a sudden revolution\nfrom hope to utter despair, he fell upon his knees, and commenced a\nprayer, in which cries for mercy to God and to his kinsman were wildly\nand blasphemously mingled. The sons of Ishmael turned away in horror\nat the disgusting spectacle, and even the stern nature of the squatter\nbegan to bend before so abject misery.\n\n\"May that, which you ask of Him, be granted,\" he said; \"but a father can\nnever forget a murdered child.\"\n\nHe was answered by the most humble appeals for time. A week, a day, an\nhour, were each implored, with an earnestness commensurate to the value\nthey receive, when a whole life is compressed into their short duration.\nThe squatter was troubled, and at length he yielded in part to the\npetitions of the criminal. His final purpose was not altered, though he\nchanged the means. \"Abner,\" he said, \"mount the rock, and look on every\nside, that we may be sure none are nigh.\"\n\nWhile his nephew was obeying this order, gleams of reviving hope were\nseen shooting across the quivering features of the kidnapper. The report\nwas favourable, nothing having life, the retiring teams excepted, was\nto be seen. A messenger was, however, coming from the latter, in great\napparent haste. Ishmael awaited its arrival. He received from the hands\nof one of his wondering and frighted girls a fragment of that book,\nwhich Esther had preserved with so much care. The squatter beckoned the\nchild away, and placed the leaves in the hands of the criminal.\n\n\"Eest'er has sent you this,\" he said, \"that, in your last moments, you\nmay remember God.\"\n\n\"Bless her, bless her! a good and kind sister has she been to me. But\ntime must be given, that I may read; time, my brother, time!\"\n\n\"Time shall not be wanting. You shall be your own executioner, and this\nmiserable office shall pass away from my hands.\"\n\nIshmael proceeded to put his new resolution in force. The immediate\napprehensions of the kidnapper were quieted, by an assurance that\nhe might yet live for days, though his punishment was inevitable. A\nreprieve, to one abject and wretched as Abiram, temporarily produced\nthe same effects as a pardon. He was even foremost in assisting in the\nappalling arrangements, and of all the actors, in that solemn tragedy,\nhis voice alone was facetious and jocular.\n\nA thin shelf of the rock projected beneath one of the ragged arms of the\nwillow. It was many feet from the ground, and admirably adapted to the\npurpose which, in fact, its appearance had suggested. On this little\nplatform the criminal was placed, his arms bound at the elbows behind\nhis back, beyond the possibility of liberation, with a proper cord\nleading from his neck to the limb of the tree. The latter was so placed,\nthat when suspended the body could find no foot-hold. The fragment\nof the Bible was placed in his hands, and he was left to seek his\nconsolation as he might from its pages.\n\n\"And now, Abiram White,\" said the squatter, when his sons had descended\nfrom completing this arrangement, \"I give you a last and solemn asking.\nDeath is before you in two shapes. With this rifle can your misery be\ncut short, or by that cord, sooner or later, must you meet your end.\"\n\n\"Let me yet live! Oh, Ishmael, you know not how sweet life is, when the\nlast moment draws so nigh!\"\n\n\"'Tis done,\" said the squatter, motioning for his assistants to follow\nthe herds and teams. \"And now, miserable man, that it may prove a\nconsolation to your end, I forgive you my wrongs, and leave you to your\nGod.\"\n\nIshmael turned and pursued his way across the plain, at his ordinary\nsluggish and ponderous gait. Though his head was bent a little towards\nthe earth, his inactive mind did not prompt him to cast a look behind.\nOnce, indeed, he thought he heard his name called, in tones that were a\nlittle smothered, but they failed to make him pause.\n\nAt the spot where he and Esther had conferred, he reached the boundary\nof the visible horizon from the rock. Here he stopped, and ventured a\nglance in the direction of the place he had just quitted. The sun was\nnear dipping into the plains beyond, and its last rays lighted the naked\nbranches of the willow. He saw the ragged outline of the whole drawn\nagainst the glowing heavens, and he even traced the still upright form\nof the being he had left to his misery. Turning the roll of the swell,\nhe proceeded with the feelings of one, who had been suddenly and\nviolently separated from a recent confederate, for ever.\n\nWithin a mile, the squatter overtook his teams. His sons had found a\nplace suited to the encampment for the night, and merely awaited his\napproach to confirm their choice. Few words were necessary to express\nhis acquiescence. Every thing passed in a silence more general and\nremarkable than ever. The chidings of Esther were not heard among her\nyoung, or if heard, they were more in the tones of softened admonition,\nthan in her usual, upbraiding, key.\n\nNo questions nor explanations passed between the husband and his wife.\nIt was only as the latter was about to withdraw among her children, for\nthe night, that the former saw her taking a furtive look at the pan\nof his rifle. Ishmael bade his sons seek their rest, announcing his\nintention to look to the safety of the camp in person. When all was\nstill, he walked out upon the prairie, with a sort of sensation that he\nfound his breathing among the tents too straitened. The night was well\nadapted to heighten the feelings, which had been created by the events\nof the day.\n\nThe wind had risen with the moon, and it was occasionally sweeping over\nthe plain, in a manner that made it not difficult for the sentinel\nto imagine strange and unearthly sounds were mingling in the blasts.\nYielding to the extraordinary impulses of which he was the subject, he\ncast a glance around, to see that all were slumbering in security, and\nthen he strayed towards the swell of land already mentioned. Here the\nsquatter found himself at a point that commanded a view to the east and\nto the west. Light fleecy clouds were driving before the moon, which\nwas cold and watery though there were moments, when its placid rays were\nshed from clear blue fields, seeming to soften objects to its own mild\nloveliness.\n\nFor the first time, in a life of so much wild adventure, Ishmael felt a\nkeen sense of solitude. The naked prairies began to assume the forms of\nillimitable and dreary wastes and the rushing of the wind sounded like\nthe whisperings of the dead. It was not long before he thought a shriek\nwas borne past him on a blast. It did not sound like a call from earth\nbut it swept frightfully through the upper air mingled with the hoarse\naccompaniment of the wind. The teeth of the squatter were compressed,\nand his huge hand grasped the rifle, as if it would crush the metal.\nThen came a lull, a fresher blast, and a cry of horror that seemed to\nhave been uttered at the very portals of his ears. A sort of echo\nburst involuntarily from his own lips, as men shout under unnatural\nexcitement, and throwing his rifle across his shoulder he proceeded\ntowards the rock with the strides of a giant.\n\nIt was not often that the blood of Ishmael moved at the rate with which\nthe fluid circulates in the veins of ordinary men; but now he felt it\nready to gush from every pore in his body. The animal was aroused, in\nhis most latent energies. Ever as he advanced he heard those shrieks,\nwhich sometimes seemed ringing among the clouds, and sometimes passed\nso nigh, as to appear to brush the earth. At length there came a cry, in\nwhich there could be no delusion, or to which the imagination could lend\nno horror. It appeared to fill each cranny of the air, as the visible\nhorizon is often charged to fulness by one dazzling flash of the\nelectric fluid. The name of God was distinctly audible, but it was\nawfully and blasphemously blended with sounds that may not be repeated.\nThe squatter stopped, and for a moment he covered his ears with his\nhands. When he withdrew the latter, a low and husky voice at his elbow\nasked in smothered tones--\n\n\"Ishmael, my man, heard ye nothing?\"\n\n\"Hist,\" returned the husband, laying a powerful arm on Esther, without\nmanifesting the smallest surprise at the unlooked-for presence of his\nwife. \"Hist, woman! if you have the fear of Heaven, be still!\"\n\nA profound silence succeeded. Though the wind rose and fell as before,\nits rushing was no longer mingled with those fearful cries. The sounds\nwere imposing and solemn, but it was the solemnity and majesty of\nnature.\n\n\"Let us go on,\" said Esther; \"all is hushed.\"\n\n\"Woman, what has brought you here?\" demanded her husband, whose blood\nhad returned into its former channels, and whose thoughts had already\nlost a portion of their excitement.\n\n\"Ishmael, he murdered our first-born; but it is not meet that the son of\nmy mother should lie upon the ground, like the carrion of a dog!\"\n\n\"Follow,\" returned the squatter, again grasping his rifle, and striding\ntowards the rock. The distance was still considerable; and their\napproach, as they drew nigh the place of execution, was moderated by\nawe. Many minutes had passed, before they reached a spot where they\nmight distinguish the outlines of the dusky objects.\n\n\"Where have you put the body?\" whispered Esther. \"See, here are pick and\nspade, that a brother of mine may sleep in the bosom of the earth!\"\n\nThe moon broke from behind a mass of clouds, and the eye of the woman\nwas enabled to follow the finger of Ishmael. It pointed to a human form\nswinging in the wind, beneath the ragged and shining arm of the willow.\nEsther bent her head and veiled her eyes from the sight. But Ishmael\ndrew nigher, and long contemplated his work in awe, though not in\ncompunction. The leaves of the sacred book were scattered on the ground,\nand even a fragment of the shelf had been displaced by the kidnapper\nin his agony. But all was now in the stillness of death. The grim and\nconvulsed countenance of the victim was at times brought full into the\nlight of the moon, and again as the wind lulled, the fatal rope drew a\ndark line across its bright disk. The squatter raised his rifle, with\nextreme care, and fired. The cord was cut and the body came lumbering to\nthe earth a heavy and insensible mass.\n\nUntil now Esther had not moved nor spoken. But her hand was not slow\nto assist in the labour of the hour. The grave was soon dug. It was\ninstantly made to receive its miserable tenant. As the lifeless form\ndescended, Esther, who sustained the head, looked up into the face of\nher husband with an expression of anguish, and said--\n\n\"Ishmael, my man, it is very terrible! I cannot kiss the corpse of my\nfather's child!\"\n\nThe squatter laid his broad hand on the bosom of the dead, and said--\n\n\"Abiram White, we all have need of mercy; from my soul do I forgive you!\nMay God in Heaven have pity on your sins!\"\n\nThe woman bowed her face and imprinted her lips long and fervently on\nthe pallid forehead of her brother. After this came the falling clods\nand all the solemn sounds of filling a grave. Esther lingered on her\nknees, and Ishmael stood uncovered while the woman muttered a prayer.\nAll was then finished.\n\nOn the following morning the teams and herds of the squatter were seen\npursuing their course towards the settlements. As they approached the\nconfines of society the train was blended among a thousand others.\nThough some of the numerous descendants of this peculiar pair were\nreclaimed from their lawless and semi-barbarous lives, the principals of\nthe family, themselves, were never heard of more.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n              --No leave take I; for I will ride\n              As far as land will let me, by your side.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nThe passage of the Pawnee to his village was interrupted by no scene of\nviolence. His vengeance had been as complete as it was summary. Not even\na solitary scout of the Siouxes was left on the hunting grounds he was\nobliged to traverse, and of course the journey of Middleton's party\nwas as peaceful as if made in the bosom of the States. The marches were\ntimed to meet the weakness of the females. In short, the victors seemed\nto have lost every trace of ferocity with their success, and appeared\ndisposed to consult the most trifling of the wants of that engrossing\npeople, who were daily encroaching on their rights, and reducing the\nRed-men of the west, from their state of proud independence to the\ncondition of fugitives and wanderers.\n\nOur limits will not permit a detail of the triumphal entry of the\nconquerors. The exultation of the tribe was proportioned to its previous\ndespondency. Mothers boasted of the honourable deaths of their sons;\nwives proclaimed the honour and pointed to the scars of their husbands,\nand Indian girls rewarded the young braves with songs of triumph. The\ntrophies of their fallen enemies were exhibited, as conquered standards\nare displayed in more civilised regions. The deeds of former warriors\nwere recounted by the aged men, and declared to be eclipsed by the glory\nof this victory. While Hard-Heart himself, so distinguished for his\nexploits from boyhood to that hour, was unanimously proclaimed and\nre-proclaimed the worthiest chief and the stoutest brave that the\nWahcondah had ever bestowed on his most favoured children, the Pawnees\nof the Loup.\n\nNotwithstanding the comparative security in which Middleton found his\nrecovered treasure, he was not sorry to see his faithful and sturdy\nartillerists standing among the throng, as he entered in the wild train,\nand lifting their voices, in a martial shout, to greet his return.\nThe presence of this force, small as it was, removed every shadow of\nuneasiness from his mind. It made him master of his movements, gave him\ndignity and importance in the eyes of his new friends, and would enable\nhim to overcome the difficulties of the wide region which still lay\nbetween the village of the Pawnees and the nearest fortress of his\ncountrymen. A lodge was yielded to the exclusive possession of Inez and\nEllen; and even Paul, when he saw an armed sentinel in the uniform of\nthe States, pacing before its entrance, was content to stray among the\ndwellings of the \"Red-skins,\" prying with but little reserve into their\ndomestic economy, commenting sometimes jocularly, sometimes gravely, and\nalways freely, on their different expedients, or endeavouring to make\nthe wondering housewives comprehend his quaint explanations of what he\nconceived to be the better customs of the whites.\n\nThis enquiring and troublesome spirit found no imitators among the\nIndians. The delicacy and reserve of Hard-Heart were communicated to his\npeople. When every attention, that could be suggested by their simple\nmanners and narrow wants, had been fulfilled, no intrusive foot presumed\nto approach the cabins devoted to the service of the strangers. They\nwere left to seek their repose in the manner which most comported with\ntheir habits and inclinations. The songs and rejoicings of the tribe,\nhowever, ran far into the night, during the deepest hours of which, the\nvoice of more than one warrior was heard, recounting from the top of his\nlodge, the deeds of his people and the glory of their triumphs.\n\nEvery thing having life, notwithstanding the excesses of the night, was\nabroad with the appearance of the sun. The expression of exultation,\nwhich had so lately been seen on every countenance, was now changed to\none better suited to the feeling of the moment. It was understood by\nall, that the Pale-faces, who had befriended their chief were about\nto take their final leave of the tribe. The soldiers of Middleton, in\nanticipation of his arrival, had bargained with an unsuccessful trader\nfor the use of his boat, which lay in the stream ready to receive its\ncargo, and nothing remained to complete the arrangements for the long\njourney.\n\nMiddleton did not see this moment arrive entirely without distrust.\nThe admiration with which Hard-Heart regarded Inez, had not escaped his\njealous eye, any more than had the lawless wishes of Mahtoree. He knew\nthe consummate manner in which a savage could conceal his designs, and\nhe felt that it would be a culpable weakness to be unprepared for the\nworst. Secret instructions were therefore given to his men, while the\npreparations they made were properly masked behind the show of military\nparade, with which it was intended to signalise their departure.\n\nThe conscience of the young soldier reproached him, when he saw the\nwhole tribe accompanying his party to the margin of the stream, with\nunarmed hands and sorrowful countenances. They gathered in a circle\naround the strangers and their chief, and became not only peaceful, but\nhighly interested observers of what was passing. As it was evident that\nHard-Heart intended to speak, the former stopped, and manifested their\nreadiness to listen, the trapper performing the office of interpreter.\nThen the young chief addressed his people, in the usual metaphorical\nlanguage of an Indian. He commenced by alluding to the antiquity and\nrenown of his own nation. He spoke of their successes in the hunts and\non the war-path; of the manner in which they had always known how to\ndefend their rights and to chastise their enemies. After he had said\nenough to manifest his respect for the greatness of the Loups, and to\nsatisfy the pride of the listeners, he made a sudden transition to the\nrace of whom the strangers were members. He compared their countless\nnumbers to the flights of migratory birds in the season of blossoms, or\nin the fall of the year. With a delicacy, that none know better how\nto practise than an Indian warrior, he made no direct mention of the\nrapacious temper, that so many of them had betrayed, in their dealings\nwith the Red-men. Feeling that the sentiment of distrust was strongly\nengrafted in the tempers of his tribe, he rather endeavoured to soothe\nany just resentment they might entertain, by indirect excuses and\napologies. He reminded the listeners that even the Pawnee Loups had\nbeen obliged to chase many unworthy individuals from their villages. The\nWahcondah sometimes veiled his countenance from a Red-man. No doubt the\nGreat Spirit of the Pale-faces often looked darkly on his children.\nSuch as were abandoned to the worker of evil could never be brave or\nvirtuous, let the colour of the skin be what it might. He bade his young\nmen look at the hands of the Big-knives. They were not empty, like those\nof hungry beggars. Neither were they filled with goods, like those of\nknavish traders. They were, like themselves, warriors, and they carried\narms which they knew well how to use--they were worthy to be called\nbrothers!\n\nThen he directed the attention of all to the chief of the strangers. He\nwas a son of their great white father. He had not come upon the prairies\nto frighten the buffaloes from their pastures, or to seek the game of\nthe Indians. Wicked men had robbed him of one of his wives; no doubt she\nwas the most obedient, the meekest, the loveliest of them all. They had\nonly to open their eyes to see that his words must be true. Now, that\nthe white chief had found his wife, he was about to return to his own\npeople in peace. He would tell them that the Pawnees were just, and\nthere would be a line of wampum between the two nations. Let all his\npeople wish the strangers a safe return to their towns. The warriors of\nthe Loups knew both how to receive their enemies, and how to clear the\nbriars from the path of their friends.\n\nThe heart of Middleton beat quick, as the young partisan[*] alluded to\nthe charms of Inez, and for an instant he cast an impatient glance at\nhis little line of artillerists; but the chief from that moment appeared\nto forget he had ever seen so fair a being. His feelings, if he had any\non the subject, were veiled behind the cold mask of Indian self-denial.\nHe took each warrior by the hand, not forgetting the meanest soldier,\nbut his cold and collected eye never wandered, for an instant, towards\neither of the females. Arrangements had been made for their comfort,\nwith a prodigality and care that had not failed to excite some surprise\nin his young men, but in no other particular did he shock their manly\npride, by betraying any solicitude in behalf of the weaker sex.\n\n    [*] The Americans and the Indians have adopted several words, which\n    each believe peculiar to the language of the others. Thus \"squaw,\"\n    \"papoose,\" or child, wigwam, &c. &c., though it is doubtful\n    whether they belonged at all to any Indian dialect, are much used\n    by both white and red men in their Intercourse. Many words are\n    derived from the French, in this species of prairie nomaic.\n    Partisan, brave, &c. are of the number.\n\nThe leave-taking was general and imposing. Each male Pawnee was sedulous\nto omit no one of the strange warriors in his attentions, and of course\nthe ceremony occupied some time. The only exception, and that was not\ngeneral, was in the case of Dr. Battius. Not a few of the young men,\nit is true, were indifferent about lavishing civilities on one of so\ndoubtful a profession, but the worthy naturalist found some consolation\nin the more matured politeness of the old men, who had inferred, that\nthough not of much use in war, the medicine of the Big-knives might\npossibly be made serviceable in peace.\n\nWhen all of Middleton's party had embarked, the trapper lifted a small\nbundle, which had lain at his feet during the previous proceedings,\nand whistling Hector to his side, he was the last to take his seat. The\nartillerists gave the usual cheers, which were answered by a shout from\nthe tribe, and then the boat was shoved into the current, and began to\nglide swiftly down its stream.\n\nA long and a musing, if not a melancholy, silence succeeded this\ndeparture. It was first broken by the trapper, whose regret was not the\nleast visible in his dejected and sorrowful eye--\n\n\"They are a valiant and an honest tribe,\" he said; \"that will I say\nboldly in their favour; and second only do I take them to be to that\nonce mighty but now scattered people, the Delawares of the Hills. Ah's\nme, Captain, if you had seen as much good and evil as I have seen in\nthese nations of Red-skins, you would know of how much value was a brave\nand simple-minded warrior. I know that some are to be found, who both\nthink and say that an Indian is but little better than the beasts of\nthese naked plains. But it is needful to be honest in one's self, to be\na fitting judge of honesty in others. No doubt, no doubt they know their\nenemies, and little do they care to show to such any great confidence,\nor love.\"\n\n\"It is the way of man,\" returned the Captain; \"and it is probable they\nare not wanting in any of his natural qualities.\"\n\n\"No, no; it is little that they want, that natur' has had to give. But\nas little does he know of the temper of a Red-skin, who has seen but one\nIndian, or one tribe, as he knows of the colour of feathers who has only\nlooked upon a crow. Now, friend steersman, just give the boat a sheer\ntowards yonder, low, sandy point, and a favour will be granted at a\nshort asking.\"\n\n\"For what?\" demanded Middleton; \"we are now in the swiftest of the\ncurrent, and by drawing to the shore we shall lose the force of the\nstream.\"\n\n\"Your tarry will not be long,\" returned the old man, applying his own\nhand to the execution of that which he had requested. The oarsmen had\nseen enough of his influence, with their leader, not to dispute his\nwishes, and before time was given for further discussion on the subject,\nthe bow of the boat had touched the land.\n\n\"Captain,\" resumed the other, untying his little wallet with great\ndeliberation, and even in a manner to show he found satisfaction in the\ndelay, \"I wish to offer you a small matter of trade. No great bargain,\nmayhap; but still the best that one, of whose hand the skill of the\nrifle has taken leave, and who has become no better than a miserable\ntrapper, can offer before we part.\"\n\n\"Part!\" was echoed from every mouth, among those who had so recently\nshared his dangers, and profited by his care.\n\n\"What the devil, old trapper, do you mean to foot it to the settlements,\nwhen here is a boat that will float the distance in half the time,\nthat the jackass, the Doctor has given the Pawnee, could trot along the\nsame.\"\n\n\"Settlements, boy! It is long sin' I took my leave of the waste and\nwickedness of the settlements and the villages. If I live in a clearing,\nhere, it is one of the Lord's making, and I have no hard thoughts on the\nmatter; but never again shall I be seen running wilfully into the danger\nof immoralities.\"\n\n\"I had not thought of parting,\" answered Middleton, endeavouring to\nseek some relief from the uneasiness he felt, by turning his eyes on the\nsympathising countenances of his friends; \"on the contrary, I had hoped\nand believed that you would have accompanied us below, where I give\nyou a sacred pledge, nothing shall be wanting to make your days\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Yes, lad, yes; you would do your endeavours; but what are the strivings\nof man against the working of the devil! Ay, if kind offers and good\nwishes could have done the thing, I might have been a congress man, or\nperhaps a governor, years agone. Your grand'ther wished the same, and\nthere are them still lying in the Otsego mountains, as I hope, who\nwould gladly have given me a palace for my dwelling. But what are riches\nwithout content! My time must now be short, at any rate, and I hope\nit's no mighty sin for one, who has acted his part honestly near ninety\nwinters and summers, to wish to pass the few hours that remain in\ncomfort. If you think I have done wrong in coming thus far to quit\nyou again, Captain, I will own the reason of the act, without shame or\nbackwardness. Though I have seen so much of the wilderness, it is not\nto be gainsayed, that my feelings, as well as my skin, are white. Now it\nwould not be a fitting spectacle, that yonder Pawnee Loups should look\nupon the weakness of an old warrior, if weakness he should happen to\nshow in parting for ever from those he has reason to love, though he\nmay not set his heart so strongly on them, as to wish to go into the\nsettlements in their company.\"\n\n\"Harkee, old trapper,\" said Paul, clearing his throat with a desperate\neffort, as if determined to give his voice a clear exit; \"I have just\none bargain to make, since you talk of trading, which is neither more or\nless than this. I offer you, as my side of the business, one half of my\nshanty, nor do I much care if it be the biggest half; the sweetest and\nthe purest honey that can be made of the wild locust; always enough to\neat, with now and then a mouthful of venison, or, for that matter, a\nmorsel of buffaloe's hump, seeing that I intend to push my acquaintance\nwith the animal, and as good and as tidy cooking as can come from\nthe hands of one like Ellen Wade, here, who will shortly be Nelly\nsomebody-else, and altogether such general treatment as a decent man\nmight be supposed to pay to his best friend, or for that matter, to his\nown father; in return for the same, you ar' to give us at odd moments\nsome of your ancient traditions, perhaps a little wholesome advice on\noccasions, in small quantities at a time, and as much of your agreeable\ncompany as you please.\"\n\n\"It is well--it is well, boy,\" returned the old man, fumbling at his\nwallet; \"honestly offered, and not unthankfully declined--but it cannot\nbe; no, it can never be.\"\n\n\"Venerable venator,\" said Dr. Battius; \"there are obligations, which\nevery man owes to society and to human nature. It is time that you\nshould return to your countrymen, to deliver up some of those stores\nof experimental knowledge that you have doubtless obtained by so long\na sojourn in the wilds, which, however they may be corrupted by\npreconceived opinions, will prove acceptable bequests to those whom, as\nyou say, you must shortly leave for ever.\"\n\n\"Friend physicianer,\" returned the trapper, looking the other steadily\nin the face, \"as it would be no easy matter to judge of the temper of\nthe rattler by considering the fashions of the moose, so it would be\nhard to speak of the usefulness of one man by thinking too much of the\ndeeds of another. You have your gifts like others, I suppose, and little\ndo I wish to disturb them. But as to me, the Lord has made me for a doer\nand not a talker, and therefore do I consider it no harm to shut my ears\nto your invitation.\"\n\n\"It is enough,\" interrupted Middleton, \"I have seen and heard so much of\nthis extraordinary man, as to know that persuasions will not change his\npurpose. First we will hear your request, my friend, and then we will\nconsider what may be best done for your advantage.\"\n\n\"It is a small matter, Captain,\" returned the old man, succeeding at\nlength in opening his bundle. \"A small and trifling matter is it, to\nwhat I once used to offer in the way of bargain; but then it is the\nbest I have, and therein not to be despised. Here are the skins of four\nbeavers, that I took, it might be a month afore we met, and here is\nanother from a racoon, that is of no great matter to be sure, but which\nmay serve to make weight atween us.\"\n\n\"And what do you propose to do with them?\"\n\n\"I offer them in lawful barter. Them knaves the Siouxes, the Lord\nforgive me for ever believing it was the Konzas! have stolen the best of\nmy traps, and driven me altogether to make-shift inventions, which might\nforetell a dreary winter for me, should my time stretch into another\nseason. I wish you therefore to take the skins, and to offer them to\nsome of the trappers you will not fail to meet below in exchange for a\nfew traps, and to send the same into the Pawnee village in my name. Be\ncareful to have my mark painted on them; a letter N, with a hound's ear,\nand the lock of a rifle. There is no Red-skin who will then dispute my\nright. For all which trouble I have little more to offer than my thanks,\nunless my friend, the bee-hunter here, will accept of the racoon, and\ntake on himself the special charge of the whole matter.\"\n\n\"If I do, may I b--!\" The mouth of Paul was stopped by the hand of\nEllen, and he was obliged to swallow the rest of the sentence, which\nhe did with a species of emotion that bore no slight resemblance to the\nprocess of strangulation.\n\n\"Well, well,\" returned the old man, meekly; \"I hope there is no heavy\noffence in the offer. I know that the skin of a racoon is of small\nprice, but then it was no mighty labour that I asked in return.\"\n\n\"You entirely mistake the meaning of our friend,\" interrupted Middleton,\nwho observed, that the bee-hunter was looking in every direction but the\nright one, and that he was utterly unable to make his own vindication.\n\"He did not mean to say that he declined the charge, but merely that\nhe refused all compensation. It is unnecessary, however, to say more\nof this; it shall be my office to see that the debt we owe, is properly\ndischarged, and that all your necessities shall be anticipated.\"\n\n\"Anan!\" said the old man, looking up enquiringly into the other's face,\nas if to ask an explanation.\n\n\"It shall all be as you wish. Lay the skins with my baggage. We will\nbargain for you as for ourselves.\"\n\n\"Thankee, thankee, Captain; you grand'ther was of a free and generous\nmind. So much so, in truth, that those just people, the Delawares,\ncalled him the 'Openhand.' I wish, now, I was as I used to be, in order\nthat I might send in the lady a few delicate martens for her tippets\nand overcoats, just to show you that I know how to give courtesy\nfor courtesy. But do not expect the same, for I am too old to give a\npromise! It will all be just as the Lord shall see fit. I can offer you\nnothing else, for I haven't liv'd so long in the wilderness, not to know\nthe scrupulous ways of a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Harkee, old trapper,\" cried the bee-hunter, striking his own hand into\nthe open palm which the other had extended, with a report but little\nbelow the crack of a rifle, \"I have just two things to say--Firstly,\nthat the Captain has told you my meaning better than I can myself; and,\nsecondly, if you want a skin, either for your private use or to send\nabroad, I have it at your service, and that is the skin of one Paul\nHover.\"\n\nThe old man returned the grasp he received, and opened his mouth to the\nutmost, in his extraordinary, silent, laugh.\n\n\"You couldn't have given such a squeeze, boy, when the Teton squaws\nwere about you with their knives! Ah! you are in your prime, and in your\nvigour and happiness, if honesty lies in your path.\" Then the expression\nof his rugged features suddenly changed to a look of seriousness and\nthought. \"Come hither, lad,\" he said, leading the bee-hunter by a button\nto the land, and speaking apart in a tone of admonition and confidence;\n\"much has passed atween us on the pleasures and respectableness of a\nlife in the woods, or on the borders. I do not now mean to say that all\nyou have heard is not true, but different tempers call for different\nemployments. You have taken to your bosom, there, a good and kind child,\nand it has become your duty to consider her, as well as yourself,\nin setting forth in life. You are a little given to skirting the\nsettlements but, to my poor judgment, the girl would be more like a\nflourishing flower in the sun of a clearing, than in the winds of a\nprairie. Therefore forget any thing you may have heard from me, which is\nnevertheless true, and turn your mind on the ways of the inner country.\"\n\nPaul could only answer with a squeeze, that would have brought tears\nfrom the eyes of most men, but which produced no other effect on the\nindurated muscles of the other, than to make him laugh and nod, as if\nhe received the same as a pledge that the bee-hunter would remember his\nadvice. The trapper then turned away from his rough but warm-hearted\ncompanion; and, having called Hector from the boat, he seemed anxious\nstill to utter a few words more.\n\n\"Captain,\" he at length resumed, \"I know when a poor man talks of\ncredit, he deals in a delicate word, according to the fashions of the\nworld; and when an old man talks of life, he speaks of that which he may\nnever see; nevertheless there is one thing I will say, and that is not\nso much on my own behalf as on that of another person. Here is Hector,\na good and faithful pup, that has long outlived the time of a dog; and,\nlike his master, he looks more to comfort now, than to any deeds in\nrunning. But the creatur' has his feelings as well as a Christian. He\nhas consorted latterly with his kinsman, there, in such a sort as to\nfind great pleasure in his company, and I will acknowledge that it\ntouches my feelings to part the pair so soon. If you will set a value\non your hound, I will endeavour to send it to you in the spring, more\nespecially should them same traps come safe to hand; or, if you dislike\nparting with the animal altogether, I will just ask you for his loan\nthrough the winter. I think I can see my pup will not last beyond that\ntime, for I have judgment in these matters, since many is the friend,\nboth hound and Red-skin, that I have seen depart in my day, though the\nLord hath not yet seen fit to order his angels to sound forth my name.\"\n\n\"Take him, take him,\" cried Middleton; \"take all, or any thing!\"\n\nThe old man whistled the younger dog to the land; and then he proceeded\nto the final adieus. Little was said on either side. The trapper took\neach person solemnly by the hand, and uttered something friendly and\nkind to all. Middleton was perfectly speechless, and was driven to\naffect busying himself among the baggage. Paul whistled with all\nhis might, and even Obed took his leave with an effort that bore the\nappearance of desperate philosophical resolution. When he had made the\ncircuit of the whole, the old man, with his own hands, shoved the boat\ninto the current, wishing God to speed them. Not a word was spoken, nor\na stroke of the oar given, until the travellers had floated past a knoll\nthat hid the trapper from their view. He was last seen standing on the\nlow point, leaning on his rifle, with Hector crouched at his feet, and\nthe younger dog frisking along the sands, in the playfulness of youth\nand vigour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n                    --Methought, I heard a voice.\n                                                   --Shakspeare.\n\nThe water-courses were at their height, and the boat went down the swift\ncurrent like a bird. The passage proved prosperous and speedy. In less\nthan a third of the time, that would have been necessary for the same\njourney by land, it was accomplished by the favour of those rapid\nrivers. Issuing from one stream into another, as the veins of the human\nbody communicate with the larger channels of life, they soon entered the\ngrand artery of the western waters, and landed safely at the very door\nof the father of Inez.\n\nThe joy of Don Augustin, and the embarrassment of the worthy father\nIgnatius, may be imagined. The former wept and returned thanks\nto Heaven; the latter returned thanks, and did not weep. The mild\nprovincials were too happy to raise any questions on the character of so\njoyful a restoration; and, by a sort of general consent, it soon came to\nbe an admitted opinion that the bride of Middleton had been kidnapped\nby a villain, and that she was restored to her friends by human agency.\nThere were, as respects this belief, certainly a few sceptics, but then\nthey enjoyed their doubts in private, with that species of sublimated\nand solitary gratification that a miser finds in gazing at his growing,\nbut useless, hoards.\n\nIn order to give the worthy priest something to employ his mind,\nMiddleton made him the instrument of uniting Paul and Ellen. The former\nconsented to the ceremony, because he found that all his friends laid\ngreat stress on the matter; but shortly after he led his bride into\nthe plains of Kentucky, under the pretence of paying certain customary\nvisits to sundry members of the family of Hover. While there, he took\noccasion to have the marriage properly solemnised, by a justice of the\npeace of his acquaintance, in whose ability to forge the nuptial chain\nhe had much more faith than in that of all the gownsmen within the\npale of Rome. Ellen, who appeared conscious that some extraordinary\npreventives might prove necessary to keep one of so erratic a temper\nas her partner, within the proper matrimonial boundaries, raised no\nobjections to these double knots, and all parties were content.\n\nThe local importance Middleton had acquired, by his union with the\ndaughter of so affluent a proprietor as Don Augustin, united to his\npersonal merit, attracted the attention of the government. He was soon\nemployed in various situations of responsibility and confidence, which\nboth served to elevate his character in the public estimation, and to\nafford the means of patronage. The bee-hunter was among the first of\nthose to whom he saw fit to extend his favour. It was far from difficult\nto find situations suited to the abilities of Paul, in the state of\nsociety that existed three-and-twenty years ago in those regions. The\nefforts of Middleton and Inez, in behalf of her husband, were warmly and\nsagaciously seconded by Ellen, and they succeeded, in process of time,\nin working a great and beneficial change in his character. He soon\nbecame a land-holder, then a prosperous cultivator of the soil, and\nshortly after a town-officer. By that progressive change in fortune,\nwhich in the republic is often seen to be so singularly accompanied by\na corresponding improvement in knowledge and self-respect, he went on,\nfrom step to step, until his wife enjoyed the maternal delight of seeing\nher children placed far beyond the danger of returning to that state\nfrom which both their parents had issued. Paul is actually at this\nmoment a member of the lower branch of the legislature of the State\nwhere he has long resided; and he is even notorious for making speeches\nthat have a tendency to put that deliberative body in good humour, and\nwhich, as they are based on great practical knowledge suited to the\ncondition of the country, possess a merit that is much wanted in many\nmore subtle and fine-spun theories, that are daily heard in similar\nassemblies, to issue from the lips of certain instinctive politicians.\nBut all these happy fruits were the results of much care, and of a long\nperiod of time. Middleton, who fills, with a credit better suited to\nthe difference in their educations, a seat in a far higher branch of\nlegislative authority, is the source from which we have derived most of\nthe intelligence necessary to compose our legend. In addition to what he\nhas related of Paul, and of his own continued happiness, he has added\na short narrative of what took place in a subsequent visit to the\nprairies, with which, as we conceive it a suitable termination to what\nhas gone before, we shall judge it wise to conclude our labours.\n\nIn the autumn of the year, that succeeded the season, in which the\npreceding events occurred, the young man, still in the military service,\nfound himself on the waters of the Missouri, at a point not far remote\nfrom the Pawnee towns. Released from any immediate calls of duty,\nand strongly urged to the measure by Paul, who was in his company, he\ndetermined to take horse, and cross the country to visit the partisan,\nand to enquire into the fate of his friend the trapper. As his train\nwas suited to his functions and rank, the journey was effected, with the\nprivations and hardships that are the accompaniments of all travelling\nin a wild, but without any of those dangers and alarms that marked his\nformer passage through the same regions. When within a proper distance,\nhe despatched an Indian runner, belonging to a friendly tribe, to\nannounce the approach of himself and party, continuing his route at a\ndeliberate pace, in order that the intelligence might, as was customary,\nprecede his arrival. To the surprise of the travellers their message was\nunanswered. Hour succeeded hour, and mile after mile was passed, without\nbringing either the signs of an honourable reception, or the more simple\nassurances of a friendly welcome. At length the cavalcade, at whose head\nrode Middleton and Paul, descended from the elevated plain, on which\nthey had long been journeying, to a luxuriant bottom, that brought them\nto the level of the village of the Loups. The sun was beginning to fall,\nand a sheet of golden light was spread over the placid plain, lending\nto its even surface those glorious tints and hues, that, the human\nimagination is apt to conceive, forms the embellishment of still more\nimposing scenes. The verdure of the year yet remained, and herds of\nhorses and mules were grazing peacefully in the vast natural pasture,\nunder the keeping of vigilant Pawnee boys. Paul pointed out among\nthem, the well-known form of Asinus, sleek, fat, and luxuriating in the\nfulness of content, as he stood with reclining ears and closed eye-lids,\nseemingly musing on the exquisite nature of his present indolent\nenjoyment.\n\nThe route of the party led them at no great distance from one of those\nwatchful youths, who was charged with a trust heavy as the principal\nwealth of his tribe. He heard the trampling of the horses, and cast\nhis eye aside, but instead of manifesting curiosity or alarm, his look\ninstantly returned whence it had been withdrawn, to the spot where the\nvillage was known to stand.\n\n\"There is something remarkable in all this,\" muttered Middleton, half\noffended at what he conceived to be not only a slight to his rank, but\noffensive to himself, personally; \"yonder boy has heard of our approach,\nor he would not fail to notify his tribe; and yet he scarcely deigns to\nfavour us with a glance. Look to your arms, men; it may be necessary to\nlet these savages feel our strength.\"\n\n\"Therein, Captain, I think you're in an error,\" returned Paul, \"if\nhonesty is to be met on the prairies at all, you will find it in our old\nfriend Hard-Heart; neither is an Indian to be judged of by the rules of\na white. See! we are not altogether slighted, for here comes a party at\nlast to meet us, though it is a little pitiful as to show and numbers.\"\n\nPaul was right in both particulars. A group of horsemen were at length\nseen wheeling round a little copse, and advancing across the plain\ndirectly towards them. The advance of this party was slow and dignified.\nAs it drew nigh, the partisan of the Loups was seen at its head,\nfollowed by a dozen younger warriors of his tribe. They were all\nunarmed, nor did they even wear any of those ornaments or feathers,\nwhich are considered testimonials of respect to the guest an Indian\nreceives, as well as evidence of his own importance.\n\nThe meeting was friendly, though a little restrained on both sides.\nMiddleton, jealous of his own consideration no less than of the\nauthority of his government, suspected some undue influence on the part\nof the agents of the Canadas; and, as he was determined to maintain\nthe authority of which he was the representative, he felt himself\nconstrained to manifest a hauteur, that he was far from feeling. It was\nnot so easy to penetrate the motives of the Pawnees. Calm, dignified,\nand yet far from repulsive, they set an example of courtesy, blended\nwith reserve, that many a diplomatist of the most polished court might\nhave strove in vain to imitate.\n\nIn this manner the two parties continued their course to the town.\nMiddleton had time, during the remainder of the ride, to revolve in his\nmind, all the probable reasons which his ingenuity could suggest\nfor this strange reception. Although he was accompanied by a regular\ninterpreter, the chiefs made their salutations in a manner that\ndispensed with his services. Twenty times the Captain turned his glance\non his former friend, endeavouring to read the expression of his rigid\nfeatures. But every effort and all conjectures proved equally futile.\nThe eye of Hard-Heart was fixed, composed, and a little anxious; but\nas to every other emotion, impenetrable. He neither spoke himself, nor\nseemed willing to invite discourse in his visiters; it was therefore\nnecessary for Middleton to adopt the patient manners of his companions,\nand to await the issue for the explanation.\n\nWhen they entered the town, its inhabitants were seen collected in an\nopen space, where they were arranged with the customary deference to age\nand rank. The whole formed a large circle, in the centre of which, were\nperhaps a dozen of the principal chiefs. Hard-Heart waved his hand as he\napproached, and, as the mass of bodies opened, he rode through, followed\nby his companions. Here they dismounted; and as the beasts were led\napart, the strangers found themselves environed by a thousand, grave,\ncomposed, but solicitous faces.\n\nMiddleton gazed about him, in growing concern, for no cry, no song, no\nshout welcomed him among a people, from whom he had so lately parted\nwith regret. His uneasiness, not to say apprehensions, was shared by all\nhis followers. Determination and stern resolution began to assume the\nplace of anxiety in every eye, as each man silently felt for his arms,\nand assured himself, that his several weapons were in a state for\nservice. But there was no answering symptom of hostility on the part\nof their hosts. Hard-Heart beckoned for Middleton and Paul to follow,\nleading the way towards the cluster of forms, that occupied the centre\nof the circle. Here the visiters found a solution of all the movements,\nwhich had given them so much reason for apprehension.\n\nThe trapper was placed on a rude seat, which had been made, with studied\ncare, to support his frame in an upright and easy attitude. The first\nglance of the eye told his former friends, that the old man was at\nlength called upon to pay the last tribute of nature. His eye was\nglazed, and apparently as devoid of sight as of expression. His features\nwere a little more sunken and strongly marked than formerly; but there,\nall change, so far as exterior was concerned, might be said to have\nceased. His approaching end was not to be ascribed to any positive\ndisease, but had been a gradual and mild decay of the physical powers.\nLife, it is true, still lingered in his system; but it was as if at\ntimes entirely ready to depart, and then it would appear to re-animate\nthe sinking form, reluctant to give up the possession of a tenement,\nthat had never been corrupted by vice, or undermined by disease. It\nwould have been no violent fancy to have imagined, that the spirit\nfluttered about the placid lips of the old woodsman, reluctant to depart\nfrom a shell, that had so long given it an honest and an honourable\nshelter.\n\nHis body was placed so as to let the light of the setting sun fall full\nupon the solemn features. His head was bare, the long, thin, locks of\ngrey fluttering lightly in the evening breeze. His rifle lay upon his\nknee, and the other accoutrements of the chase were placed at his side,\nwithin reach of his hand. Between his feet lay the figure of a hound,\nwith its head crouching to the earth as if it slumbered; and so\nperfectly easy and natural was its position, that a second glance was\nnecessary to tell Middleton, he saw only the skin of Hector, stuffed\nby Indian tenderness and ingenuity in a manner to represent the living\nanimal. His own dog was playing at a distance, with the child of\nTachechana and Mahtoree. The mother herself stood at hand, holding in\nher arms a second offspring, that might boast of a parentage no less\nhonourable, than that which belonged to the son of Hard-Heart. Le\nBalafre was seated nigh the dying trapper, with every mark about his\nperson, that the hour of his own departure was not far distant. The rest\nof those immediately in the centre were aged men, who had apparently\ndrawn near, in order to observe the manner, in which a just and fearless\nwarrior would depart on the greatest of his journeys.\n\nThe old man was reaping the rewards of a life remarkable for temperance\nand activity, in a tranquil and placid death. His vigour in a manner\nendured to the very last. Decay, when it did occur, was rapid, but\nfree from pain. He had hunted with the tribe in the spring, and even\nthroughout most of the summer, when his limbs suddenly refused to\nperform their customary offices. A sympathising weakness took possession\nof all his faculties; and the Pawnees believed, that they were going to\nlose, in this unexpected manner, a sage and counsellor, whom they\nhad begun both to love and respect. But as we have already said, the\nimmortal occupant seemed unwilling to desert its tenement. The lamp of\nlife flickered without becoming extinguished. On the morning of the day,\non which Middleton arrived, there was a general reviving of the powers\nof the whole man. His tongue was again heard in wholesome maxims, and\nhis eye from time to time recognised the persons of his friends. It\nmerely proved to be a brief and final intercourse with the world on the\npart of one, who had already been considered, as to mental communion, to\nhave taken his leave of it for ever.\n\nWhen he had placed his guests in front of the dying man, Hard-Heart,\nafter a pause, that proceeded as much from sorrow as decorum, leaned a\nlittle forward and demanded--\n\n\"Does my father hear the words of his son?\"\n\n\"Speak,\" returned the trapper, in tones that issued from his chest, but\nwhich were rendered awfully distinct by the stillness that reigned in\nthe place. \"I am about to depart from the village of the Loups, and\nshortly shall be beyond the reach of your voice.\"\n\n\"Let the wise chief have no cares for his journey,\" continued Hard-Heart\nwith an earnest solicitude, that led him to forget, for the moment,\nthat others were waiting to address his adopted parent; \"a hundred Loups\nshall clear his path from briars.\"\n\n\"Pawnee, I die as I have lived, a Christian man,\" resumed the trapper\nwith a force of voice that had the same startling effect upon his\nhearers, as is produced by the trumpet, when its blast rises suddenly\nand freely on the air, after its obstructed sounds have been heard\nstruggling in the distance: \"as I came into life so will I leave it.\nHorses and arms are not needed to stand in the presence of the Great\nSpirit of my people. He knows my colour, and according to my gifts will\nhe judge my deeds.\"\n\n\"My father will tell my young men, how many Mingoes he has struck, and\nwhat acts of valour and justice he has done, that they may know how to\nimitate him.\"\n\n\"A boastful tongue is not heard in the heaven of a white man,\" solemnly\nreturned the old man. \"What I have done, He has seen. His eyes are\nalways open. That, which has been well done, will He remember; wherein\nI have been wrong will He not forget to chastise, though He will do the\nsame in mercy. No, my son; a Pale-face may not sing his own praises, and\nhope to have them acceptable before his God.\"\n\nA little disappointed, the young partisan stepped modestly back, making\nway for the recent comers to approach. Middleton took one of the meagre\nhands of the trapper, and struggling to command his voice, he succeeded\nin announcing his presence. The old man listened like one whose thoughts\nwere dwelling on a very different subject, but when the other had\nsucceeded in making him understand, that he was present, an expression\nof joyful recognition passed over his faded features--\"I hope you have\nnot so soon forgotten those, whom you so materially served!\" Middleton\nconcluded. \"It would pain me to think my hold on your memory was so\nlight.\"\n\n\"Little that I have ever seen is forgotten,\" returned the trapper: \"I\nam at the close of many weary days, but there is not one among them all,\nthat I could wish to overlook. I remember you with the whole of your\ncompany; ay, and your grand'ther, that went before you. I am glad, that\nyou have come back upon these plains, for I had need of one, who speaks\nthe English, since little faith can be put in the traders of these\nregions. Will you do a favour to an old and dying man?\"\n\n\"Name it,\" said Middleton; \"it shall be done.\"\n\n\"It is a far journey to send such trifles,\" resumed the old man, who\nspoke at short intervals, as strength and breath permitted; \"a far and\nweary journey is the same; but kindnesses and friendships are things not\nto be forgotten. There is a settlement among the Otsego hills--\"\n\n\"I know the place,\" interrupted Middleton, observing that he spoke with\nincreasing difficulty; \"proceed to tell me, what you would have done.\"\n\n\"Take this rifle, and pouch, and horn, and send them to the person,\nwhose name is graven on the plates of the stock,--a trader cut the\nletters with his knife,--for it is long, that I have intended to send\nhim such a token of my love.\"\n\n\"It shall be so. Is there more that you could wish?\"\n\n\"Little else have I to bestow. My traps I give to my Indian son; for\nhonestly and kindly has he kept his faith. Let him stand before me.\"\n\nMiddleton explained to the chief what the trapper had said and\nrelinquished his own place to the other.\n\n\"Pawnee,\" continued the old man, always changing his language to suit\nthe person he addressed, and not unfrequently according to the ideas\nhe expressed, \"it is a custom of my people for the father to leave his\nblessing with the son, before he shuts his eves for ever. This blessing\nI give to you; take it, for the prayers of a Christian man will never\nmake the path of a just warrior, to the blessed prairies, either longer,\nor more tangled. May the God of a white man look on your deeds with\nfriendly eyes, and may you never commit an act, that shall cause Him to\ndarken His face. I know not whether we shall ever meet again. There are\nmany traditions concerning the place of Good Spirits. It is not for one\nlike me, old and experienced though I am, to set up my opinions against\na nation's. You believe in the blessed prairies, and I have faith in the\nsayings of my fathers. If both are true, our parting will be final; but\nif it should prove, that the same meaning is hid under different words,\nwe shall yet stand together, Pawnee, before the face of your Wahcondah,\nwho will then be no other than my God. There is much to be said in\nfavour of both religions, for each seems suited to its own people, and\nno doubt it was so intended. I fear, I have not altogether followed the\ngifts of my colour, inasmuch as I find it a little painful to give up\nfor ever the use of the rifle, and the comforts of the chase. But then\nthe fault has been my own, seeing that it could not have been His. Ay,\nHector,\" he continued, leaning forward a little, and feeling for the\nears of the hound, \"our parting has come at last, dog, and it will be\na long hunt. You have been an honest, and a bold, and a faithful hound.\nPawnee, you cannot slay the pup on my grave, for where a Christian dog\nfalls, there he lies for ever; but you can be kind to him, after I am\ngone, for the love you bear his master.\"\n\n\"The words of my father are in my ears,\" returned the young partisan,\nmaking a grave and respectful gesture of assent.\n\n\"Do you hear, what the chief has promised, dog?\" demanded the trapper,\nmaking an effort to attract the notice of the insensible effigy of his\nhound. Receiving no answering look, nor hearing any friendly whine, the\nold man felt for the mouth and endeavoured to force his hand between\nthe cold lips. The truth then flashed upon him, although he was far from\nperceiving the whole extent of the deception. Falling back in his seat,\nhe hung his head, like one who felt a severe and unexpected shock.\nProfiting by this momentary forgetfulness, two young Indians removed the\nskin with the same delicacy of feeling, that had induced them to attempt\nthe pious fraud.\n\n\"The dog is dead!\" muttered the trapper, after a pause of many minutes;\n\"a hound has his time as well as a man and well has he filled his days!\nCaptain,\" he added, making an effort to wave his hand for Middleton, \"I\nam glad you have come; for though kind, and well meaning according to\nthe gifts of their colour, these Indians are not the men, to lay the\nhead of a white man in his grave. I have been thinking too, of this dog\nat my feet; it will not do to set forth the opinion, that a Christian\ncan expect to meet his hound again; still there can be little harm in\nplacing what is left of so faithful a servant nigh the bones of his\nmaster.\"\n\n\"It shall be as you desire.\"\n\n\"I'm glad, you think with me in this matter. In order then to save\nlabour, lay the pup at my feet, or for that matter put him, side by\nside. A hunter need never be ashamed to be found in company with his\ndog!\"\n\n\"I charge myself with your wish.\"\n\nThe old man made a long, and apparently a musing pause. At times he\nraised his eyes wistfully, as if he would again address Middleton, but\nsome innate feeling appeared always to suppress his words. The other,\nwho observed his hesitation, enquired in a way most likely to encourage\nhim to proceed, whether there was aught else that he could wish to have\ndone.\n\n\"I am without kith or kin in the wide world!\" the trapper answered:\n\"when I am gone, there will be an end of my race. We have never been\nchiefs; but honest and useful in our way, I hope it cannot be denied,\nwe have always proved ourselves. My father lies buried near the sea, and\nthe bones of his son will whiten on the prairies--\"\n\n\"Name the spot, and your remains shall be placed by the side of your\nfather,\" interrupted Middleton.\n\n\"Not so, not so, Captain. Let me sleep, where I have lived, beyond the\ndin of the settlements! Still I see no need, why the grave of an honest\nman should be hid, like a Red-skin in his ambushment. I paid a man\nin the settlements to make and put a graven stone at the head of my\nfather's resting place. It was of the value of twelve beaver-skins, and\ncunningly and curiously was it carved! Then it told to all comers that\nthe body of such a Christian lay beneath; and it spoke of his manner\nof life, of his years, and of his honesty. When we had done with the\nFrenchers in the old war, I made a journey to the spot, in order to see\nthat all was rightly performed, and glad I am to say, the workman had\nnot forgotten his faith.\"\n\n\"And such a stone you would have at your grave?\"\n\n\"I! no, no, I have no son, but Hard-Heart, and it is little that an\nIndian knows of White fashions and usages. Besides I am his debtor,\nalready, seeing it is so little I have done, since I have lived in his\ntribe. The rifle might bring the value of such a thing--but then I know,\nit will give the boy pleasure to hang the piece in his hall, for many is\nthe deer and the bird that he has seen it destroy. No, no, the gun must\nbe sent to him, whose name is graven on the lock!\"\n\n\"But there is one, who would gladly prove his affection in the way\nyou wish; he, who owes you not only his own deliverance from so many\ndangers, but who inherits a heavy debt of gratitude from his ancestors.\nThe stone shall be put at the head of your grave.\"\n\nThe old man extended his emaciated hand, and gave the other a squeeze of\nthanks.\n\n\"I thought, you might be willing to do it, but I was backward in\nasking the favour,\" he said, \"seeing that you are not of my kin. Put no\nboastful words on the same, but just the name, the age, and the time of\nthe death, with something from the holy book; no more no more. My name\nwill then not be altogether lost on 'arth; I need no more.\"\n\nMiddleton intimated his assent, and then followed a pause, that was only\nbroken by distant and broken sentences from the dying man. He appeared\nnow to have closed his accounts with the world, and to await merely for\nthe final summons to quit it. Middleton and Hard-Heart placed themselves\non the opposite sides of his seat, and watched with melancholy\nsolicitude, the variations of his countenance. For two hours there was\nno very sensible alteration. The expression of his faded and time-worn\nfeatures was that of a calm and dignified repose. From time to time he\nspoke, uttering some brief sentence in the way of advice, or asking\nsome simple questions concerning those in whose fortunes he still took\na friendly interest. During the whole of that solemn and anxious period\neach individual of the tribe kept his place, in the most self-restrained\npatience. When the old man spoke, all bent their heads to listen; and\nwhen his words were uttered, they seemed to ponder on their wisdom and\nusefulness.\n\nAs the flame drew nigher to the socket, his voice was hushed, and there\nwere moments, when his attendants doubted whether he still belonged\nto the living. Middleton, who watched each wavering expression of his\nweather-beaten visage, with the interest of a keen observer of human\nnature, softened by the tenderness of personal regard, fancied he could\nread the workings of the old man's soul in the strong lineaments of his\ncountenance. Perhaps what the enlightened soldier took for the delusion\nof mistaken opinion did actually occur, for who has returned from that\nunknown world to explain by what forms, and in what manner, he was\nintroduced into its awful precincts? Without pretending to explain what\nmust ever be a mystery to the quick, we shall simply relate facts as\nthey occurred.\n\nThe trapper had remained nearly motionless for an hour. His eyes, alone,\nhad occasionally opened and shut. When opened, his gaze seemed fastened\non the clouds, which hung around the western horizon, reflecting the\nbright colours, and giving form and loveliness to the glorious tints\nof an American sunset. The hour--the calm beauty of the season--the\noccasion, all conspired to fill the spectators with solemn awe.\nSuddenly, while musing on the remarkable position, in which he was\nplaced, Middleton felt the hand, which he held, grasp his own with\nincredible power, and the old man, supported on either side by his\nfriends, rose upright to his feet. For a moment, he looked about him, as\nif to invite all in presence to listen (the lingering remnant of human\nfrailty), and then, with a fine military elevation of the head, and with\na voice, that might be heard in every part of that numerous assembly the\nword--\n\n\"Here!\"\n\nA movement so entirely unexpected, and the air of grandeur and humility,\nwhich were so remarkably united in the mien of the trapper, together\nwith the clear and uncommon force of his utterance, produced a short\nperiod of confusion in the faculties of all present. When Middleton and\nHard-Heart, each of whom had involuntarily extended a hand to support\nthe form of the old man, turned to him again, they found, that the\nsubject of their interest was removed for ever beyond the necessity of\ntheir care. They mournfully placed the body in its seat, and Le Balafre\narose to announce the termination of the scene, to the tribe. The voice\nof the old Indian seemed a sort of echo from that invisible world, to\nwhich the meek spirit of the trapper had just departed.\n\n\"A valiant, a just, and a wise warrior has gone on the path, which will\nlead him to the blessed grounds of his people!\" he said. \"When the voice\nof the Wahcondah called him, he was ready to answer. Go, my children;\nremember the just chief of the Pale-faces, and clear your own tracks\nfrom briars.\"\n\nThe grave was made beneath the shade of some noble oaks. It has been\ncarefully watched to the present hour by the Pawnees of the Loop, and\nis often shown to the traveller and the trader as a spot where a just\nWhiteman sleeps. In due time the stone was placed at its head, with the\nsimple inscription, which the trapper had himself requested. The only\nliberty, taken by Middleton, was to add--\"May no wanton hand ever\ndisturb his remains!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prairie, by J.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":221,"split":"train"}
