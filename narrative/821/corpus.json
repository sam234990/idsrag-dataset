The new society is opposite to that of the previous societies - male dominated instead of female dominated, monogamous and lifelong marriages instead of the yearly contracts of Basilica.\nThe struggles between the characters ultimately come down to the struggles between Nafai and Elemak, two sons of Volemak. Nafai leads the faction who have faith in the Oversoul, while Elemak leads the faction who want desperately to return to the civilization of doomed Basilica. Both are ostensibly under the leadership of Volemak (and not Rasa, as they had been in the city).\nThe settlers, after years of traveling, finally arrive in a land lost in ancient times which holds the secret of the Oversoul. Additionally, many children are born, all in their preparation for the ultimate journey to Earth.\nThe book offers an interesting justification of the social structures of the Hebrew tribes in Genesis, all while the originally powerful female characters gradually succumb to the new hierarchy of \"men\" and \"wives.\" Only one character - Shedemei, the brilliant geneticist, thinks about this problem.\nThe focus in on the group dynamics of the new tribe as they journey where the Oversoul guides them.\nProphetic dreams abound, mostly involving giant rats and bats (\"diggers\" and \"angels\").

Best of all, he has learned to see. Wordsworth's familiar\nlines say of a man whose eyes had not been opened,--\n\n    \"A primrose by a river's brim\n    A yellow primrose was to him,\n    And it was nothing more.\"\n\nThese books are planned to show the children that there is \"something\nmore\"; to broaden their horizon; to reveal to them what invention has\naccomplished and what wide room for invention still remains; to teach\nthem that reward comes to the man who improves his output beyond the\ntask of the moment; and that success is waiting not for him who works\nbecause he must, but him who works because he may.\n\nAcknowledgment is due to the Lehigh Valley Railroad, Jones Brothers\nCompany, Alpha Portland Cement Company, Dwight W.

This\nis their story.\n\nCenturies ago, so many thousand centuries that even the most learned\nmen can only guess at their number, strange things were coming to\npass. The air was so moist and cloudy that the sun's rays had hard\nwork to get through. It was warm, nevertheless, for the crust of the\nearth was not nearly so thick as it is now, and much heat came from\nthe earth itself. Many plants and trees grow best in warm, moist air;\nand such plants flourished in those days. Some of their descendants\nare living now, but they are dwarfs, while their ancestors were\ngiants. There is a little \"horse-tail\" growing in our meadows, and\nthere are ferns and club mosses almost everywhere. These are some of\nthe descendants; but many of their ancestors were forty or fifty feet\nhigh. They grew very fast, especially in swamps; and when they died,\nthere was no lack of others to take their places. Dead leaves fell and\nheaped up around them. Stumps stood and decayed, just as they do in\nour forests to-day. Every year the soft, black, decaying mass grew\ndeeper. As the crust of the earth was so thin, it bent and wrinkled\neasily. It often sank in one place and rose in another. When these\nlow, swampy places sank, water rushed over them, pressing down upon\nthem with a great weight and sweeping in sand and clay. Now, if you\nburn a heap of wood in the open air, the carbon in the wood burns and\nonly a pile of ashes remains. \"Burning\" means that the carbon in the\nwood unites with the oxygen gas in the air. If you cover the wood\nbefore you light it, so that only a little oxygen reaches it, much of\nthe carbon is left, in the form of charcoal.\n\nWhen wood decays, its carbon unites with the oxygen of the air; and so\ndecay is really a sort of burning. In the forests of to-day the\nleaves, and at length the trees themselves, fall and decay in the open\nair; but at the time when our coal was forming, the water kept the air\naway, and much carbon was left. This is the way coal was made. Some of\nthe layers, or strata, are fifty or sixty feet thick, and some are\nhardly thicker than paper. On top of each one is a stratum of\nsandstone or dark-gray shale. This was made by the sand and mud which\nwere brought in by the water. These shaly rocks split easily into\nsheets and show beautiful fossil impressions of ferns. There are also\nimpressions of the bark and fruit of trees, together with shells,\ncrinoids, corals, remains of fishes and flying lizards, and some few\ntrilobites,--crablike animals with a shell somewhat like the back of\na lobster, but marked into three divisions or lobes, from which its\nname comes.\n\nSince the crust of the earth was so thin and yielding, it wrinkled up\nas the earth cooled, much as the skin of an apple wrinkles when the\napple dries. This brought some of the strata of coal to the surface,\nand after a while people discovered that it would burn. If a vein of\ncoal cropped out on a man's farm, he broke some of it up with his\npickaxe, shoveled it into his wheelbarrow, and wheeled it home. After\na while hundreds of thousands of people wanted coal; and now it had to\nbe mined. In some places the coal stratum was horizontal and cropped\nout on the side of a hill, so that a level road could be dug straight\ninto it. In other places the coal was so near the surface that it\ncould be quarried under the open sky, just as granite is quarried.\nGenerally, however, if you wish to visit a coal mine, you go to a\nshaft, a square, black well sometimes deeper than the height of three\nor four ordinary church steeples. You get into the \"cage,\" a great\nsteel box, and are lowered down, down, down. At last the cage stops\nand you are at the bottom of the mine. The miners' faces, hands,\noveralls, are all black with coal dust. They wear tiny lamps on their\ncaps, and as they come near the walls of coal, it sparkles as it\ncatches the light. Here and there hangs an electric lamp. It is doing\nits best to give out light, but its glass is thick with coal dust. The\nlow roof is held up by stout wooden timbers and pillars of coal. A\nlong passageway stretches off into a blacker darkness than you ever\ndreamed of. Suddenly there is a blaze of red light far down the\npassage, a roar, a medley of all sorts of noises,--the rattling of\nchains, the clattering of couplings, the shouts of men, the crash of\ncoal falling into the bins. It is a locomotive dragging its line of\ncars loaded with coal. In a few minutes it rushes back with empty cars\nto have them refilled.\n\nAll along this passageway are \"rooms,\" that is, chambers which have\nbeen made by digging out the coal. Above them is a vast amount of\nearth and rock, sometimes hundreds of feet in thickness. There is\nalways danger that the roof will cave in, and so the rooms are not\nmade large, and great pillars of coal are left to hold up the roof.\n\nNot many years ago the miner used to do all the work with his muscles;\nnow machines do most of it. The miner then had to lie down on his side\nnear the wall of coal in his \"room\" and cut into it, close to the\nfloor, as far as his pickaxe would reach. Then he bored a hole into\nthe top of the coal, pushed in a cartridge, thrust in a slender squib,\nlighted it, and ran for his life. The cartridge exploded, and perhaps\na ton or two of coal fell. The miner's helper shoveled this into a car\nand pushed it out of the room to join the long string of cars.\n\n[Illustration: HOW A COAL MINE LOOKS ABOVEGROUND\n\nAll that shows on the surface is the machinery shed where the various\nengines work to keep the air fresh, and bring up the miners and the\ncoal.]\n\nThat is the way mining used to be done. In these days a man with a\nsmall machine for cutting coal comes first. He puts his cutter on the\nfloor against the wall of coal and turns on the electricity. _Chip,\nchip_, grinds the machine, eating its way swiftly into the coal, and\nsoon there is a deep cut all along the side of the room. The man and\nhis machine go elsewhere, and the first room is left for its next\nvisitors. They come in the evening and bore holes for the blasting.\nOnce these holes were bored by hand, but now they are made with\npowerful drills that work by compressed air. A little later other men\ncome and set off cartridges. In the morning when the dust has settled\nand the smoke has blown away, the loaders appear with their shovels\nand load the coal into the cars. Then it is raised to the surface and\nmade ready for market.\n\nDid you ever notice that some pieces of coal are dull and smutty,\nwhile others are hard and bright? The dull coal is called bituminous,\nbecause it contains more bitumen or mineral pitch. This is often sold\nas \"run-of-mine\" coal,--that is, just as it comes from the mine,\nwhether in big pieces or in little ones; but sometimes it is passed\nover screens, and in this process the dust and smaller bits drop out.\n\nThe second kind of coal, the sort that is hard and bright, is\nanthracite. Its name is connected with a Greek word meaning ruby. It\nburns with a glow, but does not blaze. Most of the anthracite coal is\nused in houses, and householders will not buy it unless the pieces are\nof nearly the same size and free from dirt, coal dust, and slate. The\nwork of preparation is done in odd-shaped buildings called \"breakers.\"\nOne part of a breaker is often a hundred or a hundred and fifty feet\nin height. The coal is carried to the top of the breaker. From there\nit makes a journey to the ground, but something happens to it every\nlittle way. It goes between rollers, which crush it; then over\nscreens, through which the smaller pieces fall. Sometimes the screens\nare so made that the coal will pass over them, while the thin, flat\npieces of slate will fall through. In spite of all this, bits of coal\nmixed with slate sometimes slide down with the coal, and these are\npicked out by boys. A better way of getting rid of them is now coming\ninto use. This is to put the coal and slate into moving water. The\nslate is heavier than the coal, and sinks; and so the coal can easily\nbe separated from it. Dealers have names for the various sizes of\ncoal. \"Egg\" must be between two and two and five eighths inches in\ndiameter; \"nut\" between three fourths and one and one eighth inches;\n\"pea\" between one half and three fourths of an inch.\n\nMining coal is dangerous work. Any blow of the pickaxe may break into\na vein of water which will burst out and flood the mine. The wooden\nprops which support the roof may break, or the pillars of coal may not\nbe large enough; and the roof may fall in and crush the workers. There\nare always poisonous gases. The coal, as has been said before, was\nmade under water, and therefore the gas which was formed in the\ndecaying leaves and wood could not escape. It is always bubbling out\nfrom the coal, and at any moment a pickaxe may break into a hole that\nis full of it. One kind of gas is called \"choke-damp,\" because it\nchokes or suffocates any one who breathes it. There is also\n\"white-damp,\" the gas which you see burning with a pretty blue flame\nover a hot coal fire. Worst of all is the \"fire-damp.\" If you stir up\nthe water in a marsh, you will see bubbles of it rise to the surface.\nIt is harmless in a marsh, but quite the opposite in a mine. When it\nunites with a certain amount of air, it becomes explosive, and the\nleast bit of flame will cause a terrible explosion. Even coal dust may\nexplode if the air is full of it, and it is suddenly set in motion by\ntoo heavy a blast of powder.\n\nMiners used to work by candlelight. Every one knew how dangerous this\nwas; but no one found any better way until, about a hundred years ago,\nSir Humphry Davy noticed something which other people had not\nobserved. He discovered that flame would not pass through fine wire\ngauze, and he made a safety lamp in which a little oil lamp was placed\nin a round funnel of wire gauze. The light, but not the flame, would\npass through it; and all safety lamps that burn oil have been made on\nthis principle. The electric lamp, however, is now in general use. The\nminer wears it on his cap, and between his shoulders he carries a\nsmall, light storage battery. Even with safety lamps, however, there\nare sometimes explosions. The only way to make a mine at all safe from\ndangerous gases is to keep it full of fresh, pure air. There is no\nwind to blow through the chambers and passages, and therefore air has\nto be forced in. One way is to keep a large fire at the bottom of the\nair shaft. If you stand on a stepladder, you will feel that the top of\nthe room is much warmer than the floor. This is because hot air\nrises; and in a mine, the hot air over the fire rises and sucks the\nfoul air and gas out of the mine, and fresh air rushes in to take its\nplace. Another way is by a \"fan,\" a machine that forces fresh air into\nthe mine.\n\n[Illustration: MINERS AND THEIR MINE\n\nNotice the safety lamps in the men's caps, and the little railroad on\nwhich the cars of coal and ore travel, hauled by the useful mule.]\n\nSo it is that by hard work and much danger we get coal for burning.\nNow, coal is dirty and heavy. A coal fire is hard to kindle and hard\nto put out, and the ashes are decidedly disagreeable to handle. And\nafter all, we do not really burn the coal itself, but only the gas\nfrom it which results from the union of carbon and oxygen. In some\nplaces natural gas, as it is called, which comes directly from some\nstorehouse in the ground, is used in stoves and furnaces and\nfireplaces for both heating and cooking; and perhaps before long gas\nwill be manufactured so cheaply and can be used so safely and\ncomfortably that we shall not have to burn coal at all, but can use\ngas for all purposes--unless electricity should take its place.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nDOWN IN THE QUARRIES\n\n\nWhen walking in the country one day I came to a beautiful pond by the\nside of the road. The water was almost as clear as air, and as I\nlooked down into it, I could see that the bottom was made of granite.\nThe farther shores were cliffs of clean granite thirty or forty feet\nhigh and coming down to the water's edge. The marks of tools could be\nseen on them, showing where blocks of stone had evidently been split\noff. I picked up a piece of the rock and examined it closely. It\nproved to be made up of three kinds of material. First, there were\ntiny sparkling bits of mica. In some places there are mica mines\nyielding big sheets of this curious mineral which is used in the doors\nof stoves and the little windows of automobile curtains. With the\npoint of a knife the bits in my piece of granite could be split into\ntiny sheets as thin as paper. The second material was quartz. This was\ngrayish-white and looked somewhat like glass. The third material was\nfeldspar. This, too, was whitish, but one or two sides of each bit\nwere flat, as if they had not been broken, but split. This is the most\ncommon kind of granite. There are many varieties. Some of them are\nalmost white, some dark gray, others pale pink, and yet others deep\nred. It is found in more than half the States of the Union.\n\nThis quarry had been given up and allowed to fill with water; but it\nwas a granite country, and farther down the road there was another,\nwhere scores of men were hard at work. This second quarry was part-way\nup a hill; or rather, it was a hill of granite which men were digging\nout and carrying away. When they began to open the quarry, much of the\nrock was covered with dirt and loose stones, and even the granite that\nshowed aboveground was worn and broken and stained. This is called\n\"trap rock.\" The easiest way to get rid of it is to blast with\ndynamite and then carry away the dirt and fragments. Next comes the\ngetting out of great masses of rock to use, some of them perhaps long\nenough to make the pillars of a large building.\n\n[Illustration: OPENING A GRANITE QUARRY\n\n_Courtesy Jones Brothers Company._\n\nThe first thing to do is to strip off the soil from the stone. Then,\nas the blocks are cut out, the big derrick lifts and loads them on\nwaiting cars.]\n\nNow, granite is a hard stone, but there is no special difficulty in\ncutting it if you know how. In the old days, when people wished to\nsplit a big boulder, they sometimes built a fire beside it, and when\nit was well heated, they dropped a heavy iron ball upon it. King's\nChapel in Boston was built of stone broken in this way. To break from\na cliff, however, a block of granite big enough to make a long pillar\nis a different matter, and this is what the men were doing. First of\nall, the foreman had examined the quarry till he had found a stratum\nof the right thickness. He had marked where the ends were to come, and\nthe men had drilled holes down to the bottom of the stratum. Then he\nhad drawn a line at the back along where he wished the split to be,\nand the men had drilled on this line also a row of holes. Next came\nthe blasting. If one very heavy charge had been exploded, it would\nprobably have shattered the whole mass, or at any rate have injured it\nbadly. Instead of this, they put into each hole a light charge of\ncoarse powder and covered it with sand. These were all fired at the\nsame instant, and thus the great block was loosened from the wall.\nSometimes there seems to be no sign of strata, and then a line of\nhorizontal holes must be drilled where the bottom of the block is to\nbe. After this comes what is called the \"plug-and-feather\" process.\nInto each hole are placed two pieces of iron, shaped like a pencil\nsplit down the middle. These are the \"feathers.\" The \"plug\" is a small\nsteel wedge that is put between the iron pieces. Then two men with\nhammers go down the line and strike each wedge almost as gently as if\nit was a nut whose kernel they were afraid of crushing. They go down\nthe line again, striking as softly as before. Then, if you look\nclosely, you can see a tiny crack between the holes. There is more\nhammering, the crack stretches farther, a few of the wedges are driven\ndeeper and the others drop out. The block splits off. A mighty chain\nis then wound about it, the steam derrick lifts it, lays it gently\nupon a car, and it is carried to the shed to be cut into shape,\nsmoothed, and perhaps polished.\n\nIn almost every kind of work new methods are invented after a while.\nIn quarrying, however, the same old methods are in use. The only\ndifference is that, instead of the work being done by muscle, it is\ndone by compressed air or steam or electricity. Compressed air or\nsteam works the drill and the sledgehammer. The drill is held by an\narm, but the arm is a long steel rod which is only guided by the\nworkman. Not the horse-sweep of old times, but the steam derrick and\nthe electric hoist lift the heavy blocks from the quarry. Polishing\nused to be a very slow, expensive operation, because it was all done\nby the strength of some one's right arm, but now, although it takes as\nmuch work as ever, this work is done by machinery. To \"point\" a piece\nof stone, or give it a somewhat smooth surface, is done now with tools\nworked by compressed air. After this, the stone is rubbed--by\nmachinery, of course--with water and emery, then by wet felt covered\nwith pumice or polishing putty. A few years ago two young Vermonters\ninvented a machine that would saw granite. This saw has no teeth, but\nonly blades of iron. Between these blades and the piece of granite,\nhowever, shot of chilled steel are poured; and they do the real\ncutting.\n\nGranite has long been used in building wherever a strong, solid\nmaterial was needed; but until the sand blast was tried, people\nthought it impossible to do fine work in this stone. There was a firm\nin Vermont, however, who believed in the sand blast. They had a\ncontract with the Government to furnish several thousand headstones\nfor national cemeteries. Cutting the names would be slow and costly;\nso they made letters and figures of iron, stuck them to the stones,\nand turned on the blast. If a sand blast is only fast enough, it will\ncut stone harder than itself. The blast was turned upon a stone for\nfive minutes. Then the iron letters were removed. There stood in\nraised letters the name, company, regiment, and rank of the soldier,\nwhile a quarter of an inch of the rest of the stone, which the iron\nletters had not protected, had been cut away. By means of the sand\nblast it has become possible to do beautiful carving even in material\nas hard as granite.\n\nGranite looks so solid that people used to think it was fireproof; but\nit is really poor material in a great fire. Most substances expand\nwhen they are heated; but the three substances of which granite is\nmade do not expand alike, and so they tend to break apart and the\ngranite crumbles.\n\nA marble quarry is even more interesting than a granite quarry. If you\nstand on a hill in a part of the country where marble is worked, you\nwill see white ledges cropping out here and there. The little villages\nare white because many of the houses are built of marble. Then, too,\nthere are great marble quarries flashing in the sunshine. Sometimes a\nmarble quarry is chiefly on the surface. Sometimes the marble\nstretches into the earth, and the cutting follows it until a great\ncavern is made, perhaps two or three hundred feet deep. A roof is\noften built to keep out the rain and snow. It keeps out the light,\ntoo, and on rainy days the roof, together with the smoke and steam of\nthe engines, makes the bottom of the quarry a gloomy place. Everywhere\nthere are slender ladders with men running up and down them. There\nare shouts of the men, clanking of chains, and puffing of locomotives.\n\nMarble is cut out in somewhat the same way as granite, but a valuable\nmachine called a \"channeler\" is much used. This machine runs back and\nforth, cutting a channel two inches wide along the ends and back and\nsometimes the bottom of the block to be taken out.\n\nMarble is so much softer than granite that it is far more easy to\nwork. Cutting it is a simple matter. The saw, which is a smooth flat\nblade of iron, swings back and forth, while between it and the marble\nsand and water are fed. It does not exactly _cut_, but rubs, its way\nthrough. The round holes in the tops of washstands are cut by saws\nlike this, only bent in the form of a cylinder and turned round and\nround, going in a little deeper at each revolution. A queer sort of\nsaw is coming into use. It is a cord made of three steel wires twisted\nloosely together. This cord is stretched tightly over pulleys and\nmoves very rapidly. Every little ridge of the cord strikes the stone\nand cuts a little of it away.\n\nThere are varieties of marble without end. The purest and daintiest is\nthe white of which statues are carved; but there are black, red,\nyellow, gray, blue, green, pink, and orange in all shades. Many are\nbeautifully marked. The inner walls of buildings are sometimes covered\nwith thin slabs of marble. These are often carefully split, and the\ntwo pieces put up side by side, so that the pattern on one is reversed\non the other. Certain kinds of marble contain fossils or remains of\ncoral and other animals that lived hundreds of thousands of years ago.\nIn some marbles there are so many that the stone seems to be almost\nmade of them. When a slab is cut and polished, the fossils are of\ncourse cut into; but even then we can sometimes see their shape. One\nof the most common is the crinoid. This was really an animal, but it\nlooked somewhat like a closed pond lily with a long stem, and people\nused to call it the stone lily. This stem is made up of little flat\nrings looking like bits of a pipestem. The stems are often broken up\nand these bits are scattered through the marble. The animals whose\nshells help to make marble lived in the ocean, and when they died sank\nto the bottom. Many of the shells were broken by the beating of the\nwaves, but both broken shells and whole ones became united and\nhardened into limestone, one kind of which we call marble. Common\nchalk is another kind. Blackboard crayons are made of this: so are\nwhitewash and whiting for cleaning silver and making putty.\n\nAnother stone that builders would be sorry to do without is slate.\nThis, too, was formed at the bottom of the sea. Rivers brought down\nfine particles of clay, which settled, were covered by other matter,\nand finally became stone. It was formed in layers, of course, but,\nqueerly enough, it splits at right angles to its bottom line. Just why\nit does this is not quite certain, but the action is thought to be due\nto heat and long, slow pressure, which will do wonderful things, as in\nthe case of coal. This splitting is a great convenience for the\npeople who want to use it for roofing and for blackboards. Blocks of\nslate are loosened by blasting, and are taken to the splitting-shed.\n\nSplitting slate needs care, and a man who is not careful should never\ntry to work in a slate quarry. The splitting begins by one man's\ndividing the block into pieces about two inches thick and somewhat\nlarger than the slates are to be when finished. The way he does this\nis to cut a little notch in one end of the block with his \"sculpin\nchisel\" and make a groove from this across the block. He must then set\nhis chisel into the groove, strike it with a mallet, and split the\nslate to the bottom. This sounds easy, but it needs skill. Slate has\nsometimes its own notions of behavior, and it does not always care to\nsplit in a straight line exactly perpendicular to the bottom of the\nstratum. The man keeps it wet so that he can see the crack more\nplainly, and if that crack turns back a little to the right, he must\nturn it to the left by striking the sculpin toward the left, or\nperhaps by striking a rather heavy blow on the left of the stone\nitself. Now the chief splitter takes it, and with a broad thin chisel\nhe splits it into plates becoming thinner at each split. The second\nassistant trims these into the proper shape and size with either a\nheavy knife or a machine. Slate can be sawed and planed; but whatever\nis done to it should be done when it first comes from the quarry, for\nthen it is not so likely to break. It would be very much cheaper if so\nmuch was not broken and wasted at the quarries and in the splitting.\nIt is said that in Wales sometimes one hundred tons of stone are\nbroken up to get between three and four tons of good slate. Within the\nlast few years the quarrymen have been using channeling machines and\ngetting out the slate in great masses instead of small blocks. This is\nnot so wasteful by any means; but even now there is room for new and\nhelpful inventions.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nHOUSES OF SAND\n\n\nIf you wanted to build a house, of what should you build it? In a new\ncountry, people generally use wood; but after a time wood grows\nexpensive. Moreover, wood catches fire easily; therefore, as a country\nbecomes more thickly settled and people live close together in cities,\nstone and brick are used. Large cities do not allow the building of\nwooden houses within a certain distance from the center, and sometimes\neven the use of wooden shingles is forbidden. Of late years large\nnumbers of \"concrete\" or \"cement\" houses have been built. Our\ngrandfathers would have opened their eyes wide at the suggestion of a\nhouse built of sand, and would have felt anxious at every rainfall\nlest their homes should suddenly melt away. Even after thousands of\nconcrete buildings were in use, many people still feared that they\nwould not stand the cold winters and hot summers of the United States;\nbut it has been proved that concrete is a success provided it is\nproperly made.\n\nNo one can succeed in any work unless he understands how it should be\ndone. Concrete is made of Portland cement, mixed with sand and water\nand either broken stone, gravel, cinders, or slag; but if any one\nthinks that he can mix these together without knowing how and produce\ngood concrete, he will make a bad mistake rather than a good building\nmaterial.\n\nFirst, he must buy Portland cement of the best quality. This cement is\nmade of limestone and clay, or marl, chalk, and slag. These are\ncrushed and ground and put into a kiln which is heated up to 2500\u00c2\u00b0 or\n3000\u00c2\u00b0F.; that is, from twelve to fourteen times as hot as boiling\nwater. The stone fuses sufficiently to form a sort of clinker. After\nthis has cooled, it is ground so fine that the greater part of it will\npass through a sieve having 40,000 meshes to the square inch. To every\nhundred pounds of this powder, about three pounds of gypsum is added.\nThe mixture is then put into the bags in which we see it for sale in\nthe stores. This powder is so greedy for water that it will absorb the\nmoisture from the air around it. Even in the bags, it begins to harden\nas soon as it gets some moisture; and as soon as it hardens, it is of\nno use. The moral of that is to keep your cement in a dry place.\n\nThe second substance needed in concrete is broken stone or gravel. Of\ncourse a hard rock must be selected, such as granite or trap rock.\nLimestone calcines in a heat exceeding 1000\u00c2\u00b0 F., and therefore it\ncannot be used in fireproof construction. Soft rock, like slate or\nshale or soft sandstone, will not answer because it is not strong\nenough. Gravel is always hard. If you look at a cut in a gravel bank,\nyou will usually see strata of sand and then strata of rounded pebbles\nof different sizes. The sand was once an ancient sea beach; the\npebbles were dashed up on it by waves or storms or some change of\ncurrents. They were at first only broken bits of rock, but after being\nrolled about for a few thousand years in the ocean and on the shore,\nthe corners were all rounded. Soft rock would have been ground to\npowder by such treatment. Sometimes, if there is to be no great strain\non the concrete, cinders or pieces of brick may be used instead of\nstone; and for some purposes they answer very well.\n\nThe third substance used in concrete is sand; but it must be the right\nkind of sand, having both fine and coarse grains. These grains need to\nbe sharp, or the cement will not stick to them well. They must also be\nclean, that is, free from dirt. If you rub sand between your hands,\nand it soils them, then there is clay or loam with it, and it must not\nbe used in making concrete unless it is thoroughly washed. Another way\nof testing it is to put it into a glass jar partly full of water and\nshake it. Then let it settle. If there is soil in the sand, it will\nappear as a stratum of mud on top of the sand.\n\nThe water with which these three substances are to be mixed must be\nclean and must contain no acid and no strong alkali. As a general\nrule, there must be twice as much broken stone as sand. When people\nfirst make concrete, they often expect too much of their materials. A\ngood rule for the strongest sort of cement, strong enough for floors\non which heavy machines are to stand, is one fourth of a barrel of\ncement, half a barrel of sand, and one barrel of gravel or broken\nstone. Apparently this would make one and three fourths barrels; but\nin reality it makes only about one barrel, because the sand fills in\nthe spaces between the gravel, and the cement fills in the spaces\nbetween the grains of sand.\n\nThere are many sorts of machines on the market for mixing the\nmaterials; but small quantities can just as well be mixed by hand. The\n\"mixing-bowl\" is a platform, and on this the sand is laid. Then comes\nthe cement; and these two must be shoveled together several times.\nWhile this is being done, the broken stone or gravel must be wet, and\nnow it is put on top of the sand and cement and well shoveled\ntogether, with just enough water added so that the mass will almost\nbear the weight of a man.\n\nConcrete is impatient to be hardening, and if it is not put into the\nright place, it will begin promptly to harden in the wrong place, and\nnothing can be done with it afterwards. If it is to be made in blocks,\nthe moulds must be ready and the concrete put into them at once and\nwell tamped down. For such uses as beams and the sides of tanks where\ngreat strength is needed, the cement is often \"reinforced,\" that is,\nrods of iron or steel are embedded in it. For floors, a sheet of woven\nwire is often stretched out and embedded. At first only solid blocks,\nmade to imitate rough stone, were used for houses, but the hollow\nblock soon took their place. This is cheaper; houses built this way\nare warmer in winter and cooler in summer; and it prevents moisture\nfrom working through the walls. Many cities have regulations about the\nuse of hollow blocks, all the more strict because concrete is\ncomparatively new as a building material. In Philadelphia the blocks\nmust be composed of at least one barrel of Portland cement to five\nbarrels of crushed rock or gravel. They must be three weeks old or\nmore before being used; the lintels and sills of the doors must be\nreinforced; and every block must be marked, so that if the building\nshould not prove to be of proper strength, the maker may be known.\nThere would seem, however, to be little question of the quality of the\nblocks, for samples must pass the tests of the Bureau of Building\nInspection.\n\nEven better than the hollow block is the method of making the four\nwalls of a house at once by building double walls of boards and\npouring in the concrete. When this has hardened, the boards are\nremoved, and whatever sort of finish the owner prefers is given to the\nwalls. They can be treated by spatter-work, pebble dash, or in other\nways before the cement is fully set, or by bush hammering and tool\nwork after the cement has hardened. Coloring matter can be mixed with\nthe cement in the first place; and if the owner decides to change the\ncolor after the house is completed, he can paint it with a thin cement\nof coloring matter mixed with plaster of Paris.\n\nA concrete house has several advantages. In the first place, it will\nnot burn. Neither will granite, but granite will fall to pieces in a\nhot fire. Granite is made of quartz, mica, and feldspar, as has been\nsaid before. These three do not expand alike in heat; and therefore\ngreat flakes of the stone split off, so that it really seems to melt\naway. A well-made concrete is not affected by fire. It will not burn,\nand it will not carry heat to make other things burn. For a concrete\nhouse no paint is needed and less fuel will be required to keep it\nwarm. If the floors are made with even a very little slant,\n\"house-cleaning\" consists of removing the furniture and turning on the\nhose. Water-tank, sink, washtubs, and bathtubs can be cast in concrete\nand given a smooth finish. Wooden floors can be laid over the\nconcrete, or a border of wood can be put around each room for tacking\ndown carpets or rugs. A concrete house may be as ornamental as the\nowner chooses, for columns and cornices and mouldings can easily be\nmade of concrete; and if they are cast in sand, as iron is, they will\nhave a finish like sandstone.\n\nIt is somewhat troublesome to lay concrete in very cold weather,\nbecause of the danger of freezing and cracking. Sometimes the\nmaterials are heated, and after the concrete is in place, straw or\nsand or sawdust is spread over it. These will keep it warm for several\nhours, and so give the concrete a chance to \"set.\" Sometimes a canvas\nhouse is built over the work. When a concrete dam was to be built in\nthe Province of Quebec and the mercury was 20\u00c2\u00b0 below zero, the\ncontractors built a canvas house over one portion of the dam and set\nup iron stoves in it. When this part was completed, they took down the\nhouse and built it up again over another portion of the dam.\nSometimes salt is used. Salt water is heavier than fresh water and\nwill not freeze so easily. Therefore salt put into the water used in\nmaking the concrete will enable it to endure more cold without\nfreezing; but not more than one pound of salt to twelve gallons of\nwater should be used.\n\n[Illustration: BUILDING A CONCRETE ROAD\n\n_Courtesy Alpha Portland Cement Co._\n\nThe concrete mixer travels along the prepared roadbed, and after it\nfollow the workmen with levelers and stamps.]\n\nConcrete objects to being frozen before it is \"set,\" but it is\nexceedingly accommodating about working under water. It must, of\ncourse, be carried in some way through the water to its proper place\nwithout being washed away, but this is easily done. Sometimes it is\nlet down in great buckets closed at the top, but with a hinged bottom\nthat will open when the bucket strikes the rock or soil where the\nmaterial is to be left. Sometimes it is poured down through a tube.\nSometimes it is dropped in sacks made of cloth. This cloth must be\ncoarse, so that enough of the concrete will ooze through it to unite\nthe bag and its contents with what is below it and make a solid mass.\nSometimes even paper bags have been successfully used. The concrete,\nmade rather dry, is poured into the bags and they are slid down a\nchute. The paper soon becomes soft and breaks, and lets the concrete\nout. Sometimes concrete blocks are moulded on land and lowered by a\nderrick, while a diver stands ready to see that they go into their\nproper places.\n\nConcrete is used for houses, churches, factories, walls, sidewalks,\nsteps, foundations, sewers, chimneys, piers, cellar bottoms, cisterns,\ntunnels, and even bridges. In the country, it is used for silos, barn\nfloors, ice houses, bins for vegetables, box stalls for horses,\ndoghouses, henhouses, fence posts, and drinking-troughs. It is of very\ngreat value in filling cavities in decaying trees. All the decayed\nwood must be cut out, and some long nails driven from within the\ncavity part-way toward the outside, so as to help hold the concrete.\nThen it is poured in and allowed to harden. If the cavity is so large\nthat there is danger of the trunk's breaking, an iron pipe may be set\nin to strengthen it. If this is encased in concrete, it will not rust.\nA horizontal limb with a large cavity may be strengthened by bending a\npiece of piping and running one part of it into the limb and the other\ninto the trunk, then filling the whole cavity with concrete. If the\nbark is trimmed in such a way as to slant in toward the cavity, it\nwill sometimes grow entirely over it.\n\nConcrete is also used for stucco work, that is, for plastering the\noutside of buildings. If the building to be stuccoed is of brick or\nstone, the only preparation needed is to clean it and wet it; then put\non the plaster between one and two inches thick. A wooden house must\nfirst be covered with two thicknesses of roofing-paper, then by wire\nlathing. The concrete will squeeze through the lathing and set. Stucco\nwork is nothing new, and if it is well done, it is lasting.\n\nConcrete has been used for many purposes besides building, and the\nnumber of purposes increases rapidly. For blackboards, refrigerator\nlinings, and railroad ties it has been found available, and for poles\nor posts of all sizes it has already proved itself a success. It has\neven been suggested as an excellent material for boats, if reinforced;\nand minute directions are given by one writer for making a concrete\nrowboat. To do this, the wooden boat to be copied is hung up just\nabove the ground, and clay built around it, leaving a space between\nboat and clay as thick as the concrete boat is to be. The wooden boat\nis covered with paper and greased, then the concrete is poured into\nthe space between the boat and the clay mould; and when it hardens and\nthe wooden boat is removed, there is a boat of stone--or so the\ndirections declare; but I think most people would prefer one of wood.\nHowever it may be with rowboats, concrete is taking an important place\nin the construction of battleships, a backing for armor being made of\nit instead of teakwood. The Arizona is built in this way.\n\nConcrete that is carelessly made is very poor stuff, and dangerous to\nuse, for it is not at all reliable and may give out at any time; but\nconcrete that is made of the best materials and properly put together\nis an exceedingly valuable article.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nBRICKS, THEIR FAULTS AND THEIR VIRTUES\n\n\nThe simplest way to make a brick is to fill a mould with soft clay,\nthen take it out and let it stiffen, and then put it in the sun to\ndry. This is the way in which the \"adobe\" bricks of Central America\nare made. They answer very well in countries where there is little\nrain; but one or two heavy downpours would be likely to melt a house\nbuilt of such material.\n\nClay is a kind of earth containing mostly alumina and silica or sand,\nthat can be mixed with water, moulded into any shape, retain that\nshape after it is dry, and become hard by being burned. If you want to\nmake a china cup, you must have a fine sort of clay called \"kaolin,\"\nwhich is pure white when it is fired and is not very common; but if\nyou want to make bricks, it will not be at all difficult to find a\nsuitable clay bank. And yet the clay, even for bricks, must be of the\nright kind. If it contains too much silica (sand), the brick will not\nmould well; if too much alumina it will be weak; if too much iron, it\nwill lose its shape in burning; if too much lime, it will be\nflesh-colored when it is burned.\n\nIf you want to find out whether a building-brick is of good quality,\nthere are some tests that a boy or girl can apply as well as any one.\nFirst, look the brick over and note whether it is straight and true,\nand whether the edges and corners are sharp. Strike it, and see\nwhether it gives a clear, ringing sound. Then weigh it and soak it in\nwater for twenty-four hours. Weigh it again, and if it is more than\none fifth heavier than it was before soaking, it is not of the first\nquality.\n\nAfter the clay has been dug, it must be \"tempered,\" that is, mixed\nwith water and about one third or one fourth as much sand as clay, and\nleft overnight in a \"soak pit,\" a square pit about five feet deep. In\nthe morning the workmen shovel the mass over and feed it into the\nmachines for forming the bricks. The mixing is better done, however,\nin a \"ring pit.\" This is a circular pit twenty-five or thirty feet in\ndiameter, three feet deep, and lined with boards or brick. A big iron\nwheel works from the center to the edge and back again for several\nhours, through and through the clay. A method even better than this is\nto put the clay and sand and water into a great trough, in which there\nis a long shaft bristling with knives. The shaft revolves, mixes the\nclay, and pushes it along to the end of the trough. This is called\n\"pugging,\" and the whole thing--trough, shaft, and knives--is a \"pug\nmill.\"\n\nIn the old days bricks were always made by hand. The moulder stood in\nfront of a wet table whereon lay a heap of soft clay. He either wet or\nsanded his mould to keep it from sticking. Meanwhile, his assistant\nhad cut a piece of clay and rolled it and patted it into the shape of\nthe mould. In making bricks, there can be no patching; the mould\nmust be filled at one stroke, or else there will be folds in the\nbrick. To make a good brick, the moulder lifts the clay up above his\nhead and throws it into the mould with all his force. Then he presses\nit into the corners with his thumbs, scrapes off with a strip of wood\nany extra clay, or cuts it off with a wire, smooths the surface of the\nbrick, puts mould and brick upon a board, jerks the mould up and\nproceeds to make another brick.\n\n[Illustration: IN A NEW JERSEY BRICK MILL\n\n_Copyright by Underwood and Underwood._\n\nThis man is moulding a fire-brick to its final shape.]\n\nNo matter how expert a moulder may be, brick-making by hand is slow\nwork, and in most places machines are used. In what is called the\n\"soft-mud\" process, the clay is pushed on by the pug mill to the end\nof the trough. There stands a mould for six bricks. A plunger forces\nthe clay into it, the mould is emptied, and in a single hour five\nthousand bricks can be made. By what is called the \"stiff-mud\"\nprocess, the stiff clay is put into a machine with an opening the size\nof the end or side of a brick. The machine forces the clay through\nthis opening, cuts it off at the proper moment; and so makes bricks by\nthe thousand without either mould or moulder. A third way of making\nbrick is by what is called the \"dry process.\" The clay is pulverized\nand filled into moulds the length and breadth of a brick, but much\ndeeper, and with neither top nor bottom. One plunger from above and\nanother from below strike the clay in the mould with much force, and\nmake the fine, smooth brick known as \"pressed brick.\" All this is done\nby machinery, and some machines make six bricks at a time. These\n\"dry\" bricks are fragile before they are burned, and must be handled\nwith great care.\n\nBricks cannot be put into the kiln while they are still wet, for when\na brick is drying, it is a delicate article. It objects to being too\nhot or too cold, and it will not stand showers or drafts. In some way\nabout a pound of water must be dried out of each brick; but if you try\nto hurry the drying, the brick turns sulky, refuses to have anything\nmore to do with you, and proceeds to crack. To dry, bricks are\nsometimes spread on floors; or piled up in racks on short pieces of\nboard called \"pallets\"; and sometimes they are put upon little cars\nand run slowly through heated tunnels. The last is the best way for\npeople who are in a hurry, for it takes only from twenty-four to\nthirty-six hours to make the bricks ready to go to the kiln to be\nburned.\n\nIn one sort of kiln, the bricks themselves make the kiln. They are\npiled up in arches, but left a little way apart so the hot air can\nmove freely among them. The sides of the structure are covered with\nburnt brick and mud, but the top is left open to allow the steam from\nthe hot bricks to escape. The fires are in flues that are left at the\nbottom. They must burn slowly at first, but after a while, some forty\nto sixty hours, the heat becomes intense. Thus far the bricks have\nbeen grayish or cream-colored, but now, if there is iron in them, they\nturn red; if there is lime, they turn yellow; if a large amount of\nlime, they become flesh-colored. Besides this sort of kiln, which is\ntorn down when the bricks are sufficiently burned, there is also the\npermanent kiln, which has fixed side walls and either an open or\nclosed top. Then, too, there is a \"continuous\" kiln. This has a number\nof chambers, and the heat from each one passes into the next; so that\nbricks in one chamber may be just warming up while in another they are\nready to be taken out.\n\nWhen the bricks come out of the kiln, some of them are good and some\nare not. Those that were on the outside are not burned enough; those\nnext it are not well baked, but can be used for the middle of thick\nwalls. The next ones are of good quality; but those directly over the\nfires are so hard and brittle that they are of little use except for\npavements.\n\nPaving-bricks, however, are not to be despised. They are not as smooth\nand well finished as pressed brick, but they are exceedingly useful.\nThey need as much care in making as any others, and they must be\nburned in a much hotter fire to make them dense and hard. The tests\nfor paving-bricks are quite different from those for ordinary\nbuilding-brick. If first-class paving-bricks weighing fifty pounds are\nsoaked in water for twenty hours, they take up so little water that\nthey will not weigh more than fifty-one or fifty-one and a half pounds\nwhen taken out. To find out how hard they are, the bricks are weighed\nand shaken about with foundry shot for a number of hours. Then they\nare weighed again to see how much of their material has been rubbed\noff. A third test is to put one brick on edge into a crushing machine\nto see how much pressure it will stand. Paving-brick is cheaper than\ngranite blocks, and if it has a good foundation of concrete covered\nwith sand, it will last about three fourths as long. Brick is less\nnoisy than stone and is easier to clean.\n\nNot so very long ago, when particularly handsome bricks were needed\nfor the outside of walls and other places where they would be\nconspicuous, they were \"re-pressed\"; that is, they were made by hand\nor in a \"soft-mud\" machine, and then, after drying for a while, were\nput into a re-pressing machine to give them a smooth finish. These\nmachines are still used, but they are hardly necessary, for the\n\"dry-clay\" brick machine will turn out a smooth brick in one\noperation.\n\nAnother substance which is made of almost the same materials as brick\nis terra cotta. To make this, fire brick, bits of pottery, partly\nburned clay, and fine white sand are ground to a powder and mixed very\nthoroughly. This mixture is moulded, dried, and burned. Until\nrecently, all terra cotta was of the color that is called by that\nname, but now it is made in gray, white, and bronze as well.\n\nBricks are laid in mortar, and this makes a wall one solid mass and\nstronger than it could be without any cement. But mortar does more\nthan this. It is more elastic than brick, and therefore, when a wall\nsettles, the mortar yields a little, and this often prevents the\nbricks from cracking. Bricks are always thirsty, and if one is laid in\nmortar, it will suck the moisture out of it almost as a sponge will\nsuck up water. The mortar thus has no chance to set, and so is not\nstrong as it should be. That is why the bricklayer wets his bricks,\nespecially in summer, before he puts them in place. Lime or cement\nmortar will not set in freezing weather, and a brick building put up\nin the winter is in danger of tumbling down when the warm days of\nspring arrive.\n\nThis thirstiness of bricks is their greatest fault. Three or four days\nof driving rain will sometimes wet through a brick wall two feet\nthick, crumbling the plaster and spoiling the wallpaper. That is why\nit is a poor plan to plaster directly on the brick wall of a house.\n\"Furring\" strips, as they are called, or narrow strips of wood, should\nbe fastened on first and the laths nailed to these, or the wall can be\npainted or oiled on the outside. The best way, however, though more\nexpensive, is to build the wall double. Then there is air between the\ntwo thicknesses of brick. Air is a poor conductor of heat; so in\nsummer it keeps the heat out, and in winter it keeps it in.\n\nBut brick will suck up water from the ground as well as from a storm;\nand therefore, when a brick house is to be built in a wet place, there\nought to be a three-eighths-inch layer of something waterproof, like\nasphalt and coal tar, put on top of one of the layers of brickwork to\nprevent the moisture from creeping up.\n\nBricks have their faults, but they will not burn, and when properly\nused, they make a most comfortable and enduring house.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nAT THE GOLD DIGGINGS\n\n\nWhen gold was first discovered in California, in 1848, people from all\nover the world made a frantic rush to get there, every one of them\nhoping that he would be lucky enough to make his fortune, and fearing\nlest the precious metal should be gone before he could even begin to\ndig. The gold that these men gathered came from what were called\n\"placers\"; that is, masses of gravel and sand along the beds of\nmountain streams. Each miner had a pan of tin or iron, which he filled\nhalf-full of the gravel, or \"pay dirt,\" as the miners called it. Then,\nholding it under water, he shook off the stones and mud over the side\nof the pan, leaving grains of gold mixed with black sand at the\nbottom. This black sand was iron, and after a while the miners removed\nit with a magnet, dried what remained, and blew away the dust, leaving\nonly the grains of gold.\n\nAnother contrivance which soon came into use was the \"cradle.\" This\nwas a long box, sometimes only a hollowed-out log. At the top was a\nsieve which sifted out the stones. Nailed to the bottom of the cradle\nwere small cleats of wood, or \"riffles,\" which kept the water from\nrunning so fast as to sweep the gold out of the cradle with it. The\ncradle was placed on rockers and was also tilted slightly. The miner\nshoveled the gravel into the top of the cradle and his partner rocked\nit. The sieve kept back the stones, the water broke up the lumps of\nearth and gravel and washed them down the cradle, and the grains of\ngold were stopped by the riffles, and sank to the bottom. Sometimes\nthe \"pay dirt\" continued under a stream. To get at it, the miners\noften built a little canal and turned the water into a new channel;\nthen they could work on the former bed of the river.\n\nBefore many years had passed, the gold that was near the surface had\nbeen gathered. The miners then followed the streams up into the\nmountains, and found that much of the gold had come from beds where in\nancient times rivers had flowed. There was gold still remaining in\nthese beds, but it was poorly distributed, the miners thought.\nSometimes there would be quite an amount in one place, and then the\nminer would dig for days without finding any more. Even worse than\nthis was the fact that these gravel beds were not on the top of the\nground, but were covered up with soil and trees. Evidently the slow\nwork with pans and cradles would not pay here; but it occurred to some\none that if a powerful stream of water could be directed against the\ngreat banks of earth, as water is directed against a burning building,\nthey would crumble, the dirt could be washed down sluices, and the\ngold be saved. This was done. Great reservoirs were built high up in\nthe mountains, and water was brought by means of ditches or pipes to a\nconvenient place. Then it was allowed to rush furiously through a\nhose and nozzle, and the great stream coming with tremendous force was\nplayed upon the banks of gravel. The banks crumbled, the gravel was\nwashed into a string of sluices, or long boxes with riffles to catch\nthe gold. Soon the miners found that if quicksilver was put into these\nsluices, it would unite with the gold and make a sort of paste called\n\"amalgam.\" Then if this amalgam was heated, the quicksilver would be\ndriven off in the form of gas, and the gold would remain in a\nbeautiful yellow mass.\n\n[Illustration: HYDRAULIC GOLD MINING\n\nA placer mine at Gold Point, California, where tremendous streams of\nwater under high pressure are busy washing away the side of a\ngold-bearing hill.]\n\nThe ancient rivers had also carried gold to the valleys, and to\ncollect this a dredge, which the miners called a \"gold ship,\" came\ninto use. The \"ship\" part of this machine is an immense flat scow.\nStretching out from one end is something which looks like a moving\nladder. This is the support of an endless chain of buckets, each of\nwhich can bite into the gravel and take a mouthful of five or six\nhundred pounds. They drop this gravel into a big drum which is\ncontinually revolving. Water flows through the drum, and washes out\nthe sand and bits of gold over large tables, where by means of riffles\nand quicksilver the gold is captured. This scow was usually on dry\nland at first; but its digging soon made a lake, and then it floated.\nIt must be more fascinating to hold a pan in your own hands and pick\nout little grains of gold or perhaps even a big piece of it with your\nown fingers, but if the gravel is good the dredge makes more money.\n\nIn Alaska the great difficulty in mining is that, except at the\nsurface, the ground is frozen all the year round. At first, the miners\nused to thaw the place where they wished to dig by building wood\nfires; but this was a slow method, and now the thawing is done by\nsteam. They carry the steam in a pipe to the place where the digging\nis to be done, and send it through a hose. At the end of the hose is a\npointed steel tube. They hammer this tube into the ground and let some\nsteam pass through the nozzle. This softens the ground so that picks\nand shovels may be used. There is generally cold enough in Alaska, but\nonce at least the miners had to manufacture it. The gold-bearing\ngravel was deep, the ground was flat, and it was often overflowed.\nThey set up a freezing plant, and shut in their land with a bulkhead\nof ice several feet thick. Then they pumped out what water was already\nin and did their work with no more trouble.\n\nWhen gold began to grow less in the California gravel, the miners\nlooked for it in the rocks on the mountain-side. The placer miners\nlaughed at them and called their shafts \"coyote holes\"; but in time\nthe placers failed, while nearly all of our gold to-day comes from\nveins of white quartz in the rocks. A vein of gold is the most\ncapricious thing in the world. It may be so tiny that it can hardly be\nseen, then widen and grow rich in gold, then suddenly come to an end.\nThis is why a new mine is so uncertain an enterprise. The gold may\nhold out and bring fortunes to the investors, or it may fail, and then\nall they will have to show for their money is the memory that they\nput it into a hole in the ground. The managers of a few of the\nwell-established mines, however, have explored so far as to make sure\nthat there is gold enough for many years of digging.\n\nThe mining engineer must be a very wide-awake man. It is not enough\nfor him simply to remember what was taught him in the schools of\nmining; he must be bright enough to invent new ways of meeting\ndifficulties. No two mines are alike, and he must be ready for all\nsorts of emergencies. A gold mine now consists of a shaft or pit dug\nseveral hundred feet down into the rock, with levels or galleries\nrunning off from it and with big openings like rooms made where the\nrock was dug out. The roofs of the rooms are supported by great\ntimbers. To break away the rock, the miner makes a hole with a rock\ndrill worked by electricity or compressed air, puts powder or dynamite\ninto the hole and explodes it. The broken rock is then raised to the\nsurface and crushed in a \"stamping mill.\" Here the ore is fed into a\ngreat steel box called a \"mortar.\" Five immense hammers, often\nweighing a thousand pounds apiece, drop down upon the ore, one after\nanother, until it is fine enough to go through a wire screen in the\nfront of the box. When two hundred or more of these hammers are\npounding away with all their might, a stamping mill is a pretty noisy\nplace. The ore, crushed to a fine mud, now runs over sloping tables\ncovered with copper. Sticking to the top of the copper is a film of\nquicksilver. This holds fast whatever gold there may be and makes an\namalgam, which is scraped off from time to time, and the quicksilver\nis driven from the gold by heat.\n\nGold that is not united with other metals is called \"free milling\ngold.\" Much of it, however, is found in combination with one metal or\nanother, and is known as \"rebellious\" or \"refractory\" gold. Such gold\nmay sometimes be set free by heat, and sometimes by chemicals. One way\nis by the use of chlorine gas, and the story of it sounds almost like\n\"The house that Jack built.\" It might run somewhat like this: This is\nthe salt that furnishes the chlorine. This is the chlorine gas that\nunites with the gold. This is the chloride that is formed when the\nchlorine gas unites with the gold. This is the water that washes from\nthe tank the chloride that is formed when the chlorine gas unites with\nthe gold. This is the sulphate of iron that unites with the chlorine\ngas of the chloride that the water washes from the tank that is formed\nwhen the chlorine gas unites with the gold--and leaves the gold free.\n\nAnother method is by the use of cyanide. More than a century ago a\nchemist discovered that if gold was put into water containing a little\ncyanide, the gold would dissolve, while quartz and any metals that\nmight be united with the gold would settle in the tank. The water in\nwhich the gold is dissolved is now run into boxes full of shavings of\nzinc and is \"precipitated\" upon them; that is, the tiny particles of\ngold in the water fall upon the zinc and cling to it. Zinc melts more\neasily than gold, so if this gilded zinc is put into a furnace, the\nzinc melts and the gold is set free.\n\nVery often gold is found combined with lead or copper. It must then be\nmelted or smelted in great furnaces. The metal is heavier than the\nrock and settles to the bottom of the furnace. It is then drawn off\nand the gold is separated from the other metals, usually by\nelectricity.\n\nSometimes large pieces of gold called \"nuggets\" are found by miners.\nThe largest one known was found in Australia. It weighed 190 pounds\nand was worth $42,000. Sometimes spongy lumps of gold are found; but\nas a general thing gold comes from the little specks scattered through\nveins in rock, and much work has to be done before it can be made into\ncoins or jewelry. It is too soft for such uses unless some alloy,\nusually copper or silver, is mixed with it to make it harder.\nSometimes it is desirable to know how much alloy has been added. The\njeweler then makes a line with the article on a peculiar kind of black\nstone called a \"touchstone,\" and by the color of the golden mark he\ncan tell fairly well how nearly pure the article is. To be more\naccurate, he pours nitric acid upon the mark. This eats away the alloy\nand leaves only the gold.\n\nGold is a wonderful metal. It is of beautiful color; it can be\nhammered so thin that the light will shine through it; few acids\naffect it, and the oxygen which eats away iron does not harm it. Pure\ngold is spoken of as being \"twenty-four carats fine,\" from _carat_, an\nold weight equal to one twenty-fourth of an ounce troy. Watchcases\nare from eight to eighteen carats fine; chains are seldom more than\nfourteen; and the gold coins of the United States are about eleven\nparts of gold and one of copper. Coins wear in passing from one person\nto another, and that is why the edges are milled, so that it may be\nmore easily seen when they have become too light to be used as coins.\nWhen such pieces come into the hands of the Government, they must be\nrecoined.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE STORY OF A SILVER MINE\n\n\nA man who goes out in search of a mine is called a \"prospector.\" The\nbest prospector is a man who has learned to keep his eyes open and to\nrecognize the signs of gold and silver and other metals. A faithful\nfriend goes with him, a donkey or mule which carries his bacon and\nbeans, blankets, saucepan, and a few tools, such as a pan, pick,\nshovel, hammer, and axe. Sometimes the prospector also takes with him\na magnifying glass and a little acid to test specimens, but usually he\ntrusts to his eyes alone.\n\nWhen these few things have been brought together, the prospector and\nthe donkey set out. They wander over the hills and down into the\ncanyons. If a rock is stained red, the prospector examines it to see\nwhether it contains iron; if it is green, he looks for copper. In the\ncanyons and along the creeks he often tests the gravel for traces of\nsome valuable metal. If he finds any of these traces along the stream,\nhe follows them on the bank until they stop; then he carefully\nexamines the bank of the stream or the nearest hillside. If he\ncontinues to find bits of metal, they will lead him to a vein of ore,\nfrom which they have been broken by the wind, rain, and frost.\n\nGenerally a prospector is looking for some one special metal, and in\nhis search he often overlooks some other metal; for instance,\nthousands of the gold-seekers who rushed to California in 1849 hurried\nthrough Nevada on their way. If they had only known what was under\ntheir feet, they would have taken their picks and shovels and begun to\ndig, instead of trying to get out of the region as soon as might be.\nTen years later, the California placers were becoming exhausted, and\nminers began to go elsewhere in their search for gold.\n\nAmong those who were working in what is now the State of Nevada were\ntwo Irishmen who had been unlucky in California and had fared no\nbetter in Nevada. They wanted to go somewhere else, but they had not\nmoney enough for the journey; so they kept on with their work at the\nfoot of Mount Davidson, washing the gravel and saving the little gold\nthat they found. They were annoyed by some heavy black stuff that\nunited with the quicksilver in their cradles, interfered with the\nsaving of the gold, and put them in a very bad temper. At length a man\nnamed Henry Comstock came along, who told them that this black stuff\nwas silver ore. They examined the mountain-side, and discovered the\noutcrop or edge of a great vein containing gold and also silver. It is\nno wonder that people rushed from the east and west to the wonderful\nnew mines, for it was plain that these new \"diggings\" were not mere\nplacers, but rich veins that many years of working might not exhaust.\nEvery newcomer hoped to discover a vein; and within a year or two the\ndistrict around the Comstock lode was full of deep shafts, many of\nthem abandoned and half-hidden by low brush, but some of them yielding\nquantities of gold and silver. Before this, there had been only about\na thousand people in what is now Nevada, but in two years after the\ndiscovery of silver, there were 16,000, and a new Territory was\nformed.\n\nThe miners knew how to get gold out of ore, but silver was another\nmatter, and some of it was difficult to extract. They had so much\ntrouble that they were ready to believe in any treatment of the ore,\nno matter how absurd, that promised to help them out of their\ndifficulties. Some of them were actually persuaded that the juice of\nthe wild sagebrush would bring the silver out. It is no wonder that\nthey were troubled, for in the Comstock lode were not only gold and\nsilver, but ten or twelve other metals or combinations of silver with\nsomething else. At length processes were invented for treating the\ndifferent kinds of ore. Some kinds were crushed in a stamping mill,\nthen ground to a powder and mixed with quicksilver or mercury. This\nmercury united with both the gold and the silver, making an amalgam.\nThe amalgam, together with the finely ground ore, was put into a\n\"settler,\" and here the heavy amalgam sank to the bottom and was then\nstrained. The extra mercury was collected, and the amalgam was put\ninto a retort or kettle and heated. The mercury became a gas and was\ndriven off from the gold and silver, then caught in a vessel cool\nenough to condense it, just as a cold plate held in steam will\ncollect drops of water. Sometimes the ore was mixed with copper and\nlead. In that case common salt and copper sulphate were used. Some ore\nhad to be roasted in a furnace in order to drive off the sulphur.\n\n[Illustration: THE STORY OF A SPOON\n\n_Courtesy The Gorham Co._\n\n(1) Silver strip blanked. (2) Pinched. (3) Graded. (4) Outlining of\nHandle. (5) Stamped Handle. (6) Spoon completely trimmed. (7, 8)\nFinished spoons.]\n\nThere were great and unusual dangers to be met in getting the ore. The\nvein of quartz which bore it was fifty or sixty feet wide. Some was\nhard, and some so soft and crumbling that pillars would not hold up\nthe roof. The passageways were then lined with heavy logs standing on\neither side, other logs laid across their tops, and all bolted firmly\ntogether. Nevertheless, they twisted and fell, and slowly but\ncertainly the whole mass of earth and rock, two hundred or more feet\nin thickness, was coming down upon the heads of the miners. The work\non the Comstock mines had come to an end unless a man could be found\nable to invent some system of support not laid down in the books. The\nman was found. He took short, square timbers five or six feet long,\nput them together as if they were the sides and ends of square boxes,\nand piled them one above another, making hollow pillars. He fastened\nthese firmly together and filled the space inside with waste rock,\nthus making strong, solid pillars that would support almost any weight\nthat could be put upon them.\n\nThere were two other dangers, water and heat. The vein was porous and\nwater was constantly trickling out of it. Then, too, there were \"water\npockets,\" or natural reservoirs in the rock, and any moment the\nstroke of a pick might let out a torrent and force the miners to run\nfor their lives. Sometimes minerals were dissolved in this water, and\nthe men with closed eyes and swollen faces had to be hurried to the\nsurface for treatment. Powerful pumps had to be used and the water\nsent away through long lines of pipes. This water was warm, and in\nvery deep workings in the Comstock vein it was boiling hot. Even with\nquantities of ice sent down to cool them, the men could work in some\nplaces only a short time.\n\nIn San Francisco there was a mining engineer named Adolph Sutro who\nplanned to remedy these troubles by driving a big four-mile tunnel\nthrough the heart of the mountain, letting out the hot water and the\nfoul air. The owners of some of the mines joined him in raising the\nmoney, and the tunnel was dug. Through this the water ran out. The\nmines were freed of foul air and fresh air was driven in.\n\nThe Comstock lode has given up an amazing amount of precious metal.\nBetween 1860 and 1890 it produced $340,000,000. After 1890, however,\nits product grew less. The vein was not so rich, the price of silver\nfell, while the cost of mining it at great depths increased. Not\nnearly so much was mined, and at length water rose in the mines up to\nthe level of the Sutro Tunnel. In 1900 new machinery was put in and\nnew methods were adopted, such as treating the tailings with cyanide\nand so saving much of the precious metal from them. From the beginning\nthe Comstock mines have been so ready to follow improved methods that\nthey have been called the mining school of the world.\n\nGreat quantities of silver are used for making jewelry and for\ntableware. The one objection to its use is that silver likes to unite\nwith sulphur, and thus the silver easily becomes black. There is\nsulphur in the yolk of an egg and that is why the spoon with which it\nhas been eaten turns black. Even if silverware is not used, it\ntarnishes, especially in towns, because there is so much sulphureted\nhydrogen in the air. In perfectly pure air, it would not tarnish.\nSilver is harder than gold, but not hard enough to be used without\nsome alloy, usually copper. Tableware is \"solid\" even if it contains\nalloy enough to stiffen it. It is \"plated\" if it is made of some\ncheaper metal and covered with silver. The old way of doing this was\nto fasten with bits of solder a thin sheet of silver to the cup or\nvase or whatever was in hand and heat it. This did fairly well for\nlarge, smooth articles; but it was almost impossible to finish the\nedges of spoons so as not to show the two metals. If you look at a\nplated spoon to-day, however, you will find that there is no break at\nthe edge, and so far as you can tell by the eye, it is solid silver.\nIf you look on the back of the spoon, you will perhaps see \"Rogers\nBros. 1846.\" These men were the first silvermakers in this country to\nplate tableware by electricity. To make a spoon, they formed one out\nof iron or copper and made sure that it was perfectly clean. Then\nacross a bath of silver cyanide, potassium cyanide, and water they\nlaid two metal rods, and from these they hung a spoon at one end and a\nplate of silver at the other. These rods were connected with the two\npoles of a battery. The electrical current passed through them,\nreleased the silver from the silver cyanide, and this was deposited\nupon the spoon. The cyanide that had lost its silver took enough more\nfrom the silver plate to make up. The amount of silver on the spoon\ndepends upon the length of time it remains in the bath. It is weighed\nbefore plating and again afterwards, to make sure that the proper\namount of silver has been deposited upon it. On the back of many\nplated articles you will see the words \"Triple plate\" or \"Quadruple\nplate.\" If the article has been made by a reliable firm, this means\nthat the triple plate it manufactures contains three times as much\nsilver as \"single plate,\" and that quadruple plate contains four times\nas much. A piece of silver looks just as well if it has stayed in the\nbath only a few minutes, but of course it has taken on so little\nsilver that this will soon wear off and show the cheaper metal.\n\nA large amount of silver is used for coins. When the United States\nneeds dollars, half-dollars, quarters, and dimes, notice is given and\noffers are called for, stating the quantity for sale and its price.\nWhen it is delivered, it is first of all \"assayed\"; that is, tested to\nfind out how nearly pure it is and how much it is worth. Next it is\nrefined, or purified from other metals, mixed with a little copper to\nharden it, then melted again and poured into moulds to make bars. If\ndollars are to be made, the bar is made thinner by passing it between\nheavy rollers, and blanks for dollars are cut out with a die. These\nblanks are weighed and every one that is too heavy or too light is put\nback to be melted over again. Thus far these dollars are only round,\nsmooth pieces of metal. They must be milled to give them a rough edge,\nand they must be stamped. For stamping, the piece of metal is placed\nbetween two dies, one above and one below, and these close upon it\nwith a force of one hundred and fifty tons. Every part of the process\nof manufacturing money is carried on with the utmost care. The places\nwhere coins are made are called \"mints.\" The United States has four;\nthe oldest is in Philadelphia, and there are branch mints in San\nFrancisco, New Orleans, and Denver. Coins minted in Philadelphia have\nno distinguishing mark; but coins minted in San Francisco are marked\nwith a tiny \"S\"; if minted in New Orleans, with an \"O\"; and if in\nDenver, with a \"D.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nIRON, THE EVERYDAY METAL\n\n\nDid you ever realize that your food and clothes, your books, and the\nhouse in which you live all depend upon iron? Vegetables, grains, and\nfruits are cultivated with iron tools; fish are caught with iron\nhooks, and many iron articles are used in the care and sale of meat.\nClothes are woven on iron looms, sewed with iron needles, and fastened\ntogether with buttons containing iron. Books are printed and bound by\niron machines, and sometimes written with iron pens or on iron\ntypewriters. Houses are put together with nails; and indeed, there is\nhardly an article in use that could be made as well or as easily if\niron was not plenty. If you were making a world and wanted to give the\npeople the most useful metal possible, the gift would have to be iron;\nand the wisest thing you could do would be to put it everywhere, but\nin such forms that the people would have to use their brains to make\nit of service.\n\nThis is just the way with the iron in our world. Wherever you see a\nbank of red sand or red clay or a little brook which leaves a red mark\non the ground as it flows, there is iron. Iron is in most soils, in\nred bricks, in garnets, in ripening apples, and even in your own\nblood. It forms one twentieth part of the crust of the earth. Iron\ndissolves in water if you give it time enough. If you leave a steel\ntool out of doors on a wet night, it will rust; that is, some of the\niron will unite with the oxygen of the water. This is rather\ninconvenient, and yet in another way this dissolving is a great\nbenefit. Through the millions of years that are past, the oxygen of\nthe rain has dissolved the iron in the hills and has worked it down,\nso that now it is in great beds of ore or in rich \"pockets\" that are\noften of generous size. One of them, which is now being mined in\nMinnesota, is more than two miles long, half a mile wide, and of great\nthickness. The rains are still at work washing down iron from the\nhills. They carry the tiny particles along as easily as possible until\nthey come upon limestone. Then, almost as if it was frightened, the\nbrook drops its iron and runs away as fast as it can. Sometimes it\nflows into a pond or bog in which are certain minute plants or animals\nthat act as limestone does, and the particles of iron fall to the\nbottom of the pond. In colonial days much of the iron worked in\nAmerica was taken from these deposits. One kind of iron is of special\ninterest because it comes directly from the sky, and falls in the\nshape of stones called \"meteorites,\" some of which weigh many tons. In\nsome of the old fables about wonderful heroes, the stories sometimes\ndeclare that the swords with which they accomplished their deeds of\nprowess fell straight from the heavens, which probably means that they\nwere made of meteoric iron. Fortunately for the people and their\nhomes, meteorites are not common, but every large museum has\nspecimens of them.\n\nIt is not especially difficult to make iron if you have the ore, a\ncharcoal fire in a little oven of stones, and a pair of bellows. Put\non layers of charcoal alternating with layers of ore, blow the\nbellows, and by and by you will have a lump of iron. It is not really\nmelted, but it can be pounded and worked. This is called the \"Catalan\nmethod,\" because the people of Catalonia in Spain made iron in this\nway. It is still used by the natives of the interior of Africa. But if\nall the iron was made by this method, it would be far more costly than\ngold. The man who makes iron in these days must have an immense \"blast\nfurnace,\" perhaps one hundred feet high, a real \"pillar of fire.\" Into\nthis furnace are dropped masses of ore, and with it coke to make it\nhotter and limestone to carry off the silica slag, or worthless part.\nTo increase the heat, blasts of hot air are blown into the bottom of\nthe furnace. This air is heated by passing it through great steel\ncylinders as high as the furnace. The fuel used is nothing more than\nthe gases which come out at the top of the furnace.\n\nThe slag is so much lighter than iron that when the ore is melted the\nslag floats on top just as oil floats on water, and can be drained out\nof the furnace through a higher opening than that through which the\niron flows. The slag tap is open most of the time, but the iron tap is\nopened only once in about six hours. It is a magnificent sight when a\nfurnace is \"tapped\" and the stream of iron drawn off. Imagine a great\nshed, dark and gloomy, with many workmen hurrying about to make ready\nfor what is to come. The floor is of sand and slopes down from the\nfurnace. Through the center of this floor runs a long ditch straight\nfrom the furnace to the end of the shed. Opening from it on both sides\nare many smaller ditches; and connecting with these are little\ngravelike depressions two or three feet long and as close together as\ncan be. These are called \"pigs.\" When the time has come, the workmen\ngather about the furnace, and with a long bar they drill into the\nhard-baked clay of the tapping hole. Suddenly it breaks, and with a\nrush and a roar the crimson flood of molten iron gushes out. It flows\ndown the trench into the ditches, then into the pigs, till their whole\npattern is marked out in glowing iron. Now the blast begins to drive\ngreat beautiful sparks through the tapping hole. This means that the\nmolten iron is exhausted. The blast is turned off, and the \"mud-gun\"\nis brought into position and shoots balls of clay into the tapping\nhole to close it for another melting, or \"drive.\" The crimson pigs\nbecome rose-red, darken, and turn gray. The men play streams of water\nover them and the building is filled with vapor. As soon as the pigs\nare cool enough, they are carted away and piled up outside the\nbuilding.\n\nIn some iron works moulds of pressed steel carried on an endless chain\nare used instead of sand floors. The chain carries them past the mouth\nof a trough full of melted iron. They are filled, borne under water\nto be cooled, and then dropped upon cars. A first-class machine can\nmake twenty pigs a minute.\n\n[Illustration: IN THE STEEL FOUNDRY\n\nIt is a dangerous business to visit a steel mill. Tremendous kettles\ntravel overhead on huge cranes, hot metal flows from unexpected\nplaces, and there is a constant glow and steam and roar everywhere to\nconfuse the unwary.]\n\nMost of the iron made in blast furnaces is turned into steel. Steel\nhas been made for centuries, but until a few years ago the process was\nslow and costly. A workman's steel tools were treasures, and a good\njackknife was a valuable article. Railroads were using iron rails.\nThey soon wore out, but at the suggestion to use steel, the presidents\nof the roads would have exclaimed, \"Steel, indeed! We might as well\nuse silver!\" Trains needed to be longer and heavier, but iron rails\nand bridges could not stand the strain. Land in cities was becoming\nmore valuable; higher buildings were needed, but stone was too\nexpensive. Everywhere there was a call for a metal that should be\nstrong and cheap. Iron was plentiful, but steel was dear. A cheaper\nmethod of making iron into steel was needed; and whenever there is\npressing need of an invention, it is almost sure to come. Before long,\nwhat is known as the \"Bessemer process\" was invented. One great\ndifficulty in the manufacture of steel was to leave just the right\namount of carbon in the iron. Bessemer simply took it all out, and\nthen put back exactly what was needed. Molten iron, tons and tons of\nit, is run into an immense pear-shaped vessel called a \"converter.\"\nFierce blasts of air are forced in from below. These unite with the\ncarbon and destroy it. There is a roar, a clatter, and a clang.\nTerrible flames of glowing red shoot up. Suddenly they change from red\nto yellow, then to white; and this is the signal that the carbon has\nbeen burned out. The enormously heavy converter is so perfectly poised\nthat a child can move it. The workmen now tilt it and drop in whatever\ncarbon is needed. The molten steel is poured into square moulds,\nforming masses called \"blooms,\" and is carried away. More iron is put\ninto the converter, and the work begins again.\n\nThe Bessemer process makes enormous masses of steel and makes it very\ncheaply; but it has one fault--it is too quick. The converter roars\naway for a few minutes, till the carbon and other impurities are\nburned out; and the men have no control over the operation. In what is\ncalled the \"open-hearth\" process, pig iron, scrap iron, and ore are\nmelted together with whatever other substances may be needed to make\nthe particular kind of steel desired. This process takes much longer\nthan the Bessemer, but it can be controlled. Open-hearth steel is more\nhomogeneous,--that is, more nearly alike all the way through,--and is\nbetter for some purposes, while for others the Bessemer is preferred.\n\nSteel is hard and strong, but it has two faults. A steel bar will\nstand a very heavy blow and not break, but if it is struck gently many\nthousand times, it sometimes crystallizes and may snap. A steel rail\nmay carry a train for years and then may crystallize and break and\ncause a wreck. Inventors are at work discovering alloys to prevent\nthis crystallization. The second fault of steel is that it rusts and\nloses its strength. That is why an iron bridge or fence must be kept\npainted to protect it from the moisture in the air.\n\nIf all the iron that is in use should suddenly disappear, did you ever\nthink what would happen? Houses, churches, skyscrapers, and bridges\nwould fall to the ground. Railroad trains, automobiles, and carriages\nwould become heaps of rubbish. Ships would fall apart and become only\nscattered planks floating on the surface of the water. Clocks and\nwatches would become empty cases. There would be no machines for\nmanufacturing or for agriculture, not even a spade to dig a garden.\nEverybody would be out of work. If you wish to see how it would seem,\ntry for an hour to use nothing that is of iron or has been made by\nusing iron.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nOUR GOOD FRIEND COPPER\n\n\nWhere did rocks come from?\n\nSome were deposited in water, like limestone and like the shale and\nsandstone that lie over the strata of coal. Others were made by fire,\nand were thrown up in a melted state from the interior of the earth.\nSuch rocks are the Giant's Causeway in Ireland and the Palisades of\nthe Hudson River. They are called \"igneous\" rocks, from the Latin word\n_ignis_ meaning \"fire.\"\n\nWhen the igneous rocks were thrown up to the surface of the earth,\nthey brought various metals with them. How the metals happened to be\nthere ready to be brought up, no one knows. Some people think they\nwere dissolved in water and then deposited; others think that\nelectricity had something to do with their formation. However that may\nbe, metals were brought up with the igneous rocks, and one of these\nmetals is copper.\n\nNow, to one who did not know how to work iron, copper was indeed a\nwonderful treasure, for it made very good knives and spoons. The\npeople who lived in this country long before the Indians came\nunderstood how to use it, and after a while the Indians themselves\nfound out its value. They did not trouble themselves to dig for it;\nthey simply picked it up from the ground, good pure metal in lumps;\nand with stones for hammers they beat it into knives.\n\nThere was only one place in what is now the United States where they\ncould do this, and that was in northern Michigan. A long point of land\nstretches out into Lake Superior as if it was trying to see what could\nbe found there. Just beyond its reach is Isle Royal; and in these two\nplaces there was plenty of copper, enough for the Indians, enough for\nthe people who have come after them, and enough for a great many more.\nOne piece of copper which the Indians did not pick up, and the United\nStates Government did, is the famous Ontonagon Boulder, so called\nbecause it was found near the Ontonagon River. It weighs more than\nthree tons. The Indians would have been glad to make use of it, but it\nwas too hard for their tools, and so they are said to have worshiped\nit as a god. It is now in the National Museum in Washington.\n\nThe lumps of copper, such as those which delighted the hearts of the\nIndians, are known to-day as \"barrel\" copper, because they are of a\ngood size to be dropped into barrels and carried away for smelting.\nThe great boulders which the Indians could not use are called \"mass\"\ncopper. Sometimes they weigh as much as five hundred tons. The copper\nin them is almost pure, and a big boulder is worth perhaps $200,000.\nNevertheless, the mine-owners do not rejoice when they come upon such\na mass in their digging, for it cannot be either dug or blasted, and\nhas to be cut away with chisels of chilled steel. Now, a mine may be\nwonderfully rich in metal, but if working it costs too much, then\nanother mine with less metal but more easily worked will pay better.\nSo it is with these great masses of copper. They are interesting to\nstudy and they look well in museums, but they do not pay so well as\nthe \"stamp\" copper which is found in humble little bits in the gangue,\nor the rock of the vein, and has to be pounded in a stamp mill. This\ngangue is dug out and broken up as in mines of other metals. The\ncopper is much heavier than the rock, so it is easy to get rid of the\nworthless gangue by means of a flow of water. The gangue of the\nMichigan mines is exceedingly hard, but the stamps are so powerful\nthat one can crush five hundred tons in less than twenty-four hours.\nSome copper can be taken out of the mortars at once, but the rest of\nthe broken gangue is fed to jigs, or screens, which are kept under\njets of water. The water is thrown up from below and the lighter rock\nis tossed away, while the heavier copper falls through the tiny holes\nin the screens.\n\n[Illustration: IN A COPPER SMELTER\n\nThe men are pouring hot copper into moulds for castings.]\n\nAfter the ore has been through all these experiences, it comes out\nlooking like dark-colored sand or coarse brown sugar. It is not\ninteresting, and no one who saw it for the first time would ever fancy\nthat it was going to turn into something beautiful. It is dumped into\nfreight cars and trundled off to the smelting furnaces. But however\nuninteresting it looks, it is well worth while to follow these cars to\nsee what happens to it at the smelters. First of all, even before it\ngoes into the smelting furnace, it must be roasted. There is usually\nsulphur combined with the copper, and roasting will get rid of much of\nit. In some places this is done by building up a great heap of ore\nwith a little wood. The wood is kindled, and by the time it has burned\nout, the sulphur in the ore has begun to burn, and in a good-sized\nheap it will continue to burn for perhaps two months.\n\nSuch a heap is a good thing to keep away from, for the fumes of\nsulphur are very disagreeable. Indeed, they will kill trees and other\ngrowing things wherever the wind may carry them, even several miles\naway. The managers of mines of copper as well as of gold and silver\nhave learned to economize; and it has been found that instead of\nletting these fumes go into the air, they may be made to pass through\nacid chambers lined with zinc and full of water. The water holds the\nfumes, and can be used in making sulphuric acid.\n\nAfter the ore has been roasted, it is put into the furnace for\nsmelting. If you should make an oven and put into it a mixture of wood\nand roasted copper, that would be a smelting furnace. Set the wood on\nfire, pump in air to make the flame hot, and if your furnace could be\nmade hot enough,--that is, 2300\u00c2\u00b0 F., or about eleven times as hot as\nboiling water,--you could smelt copper. Of course the furnace of a\nreal smelting factory will hold tons and tons of copper ore and has\nall sorts of improvements, but after all it is in principle only an\noven with wood and ore and draft. Another sort of furnace, which is\nbetter for some kinds of ore, has a grate for the fire and a bed above\nit for the copper.\n\nImagine an enormous furnace holding between two and three hundred tons\nof metal and burning with such a terrific heat that by contrast\nboiling water would seem cool and comfortable. Suddenly, while you\nstand looking at it, but a long way off, a door flies open and the\nmost beautiful cascade--only it is not a waterfall, but a _copper_\nfall--pours out. It looks like red, red gold, rich and wonderful, with\nlittle flames of red and blue dancing over it. It might almost be one\nof the fire-breathing dragons of the old story-books; and if it should\nget loose, it would devour whomever it touched far quicker than any\ndragon. It hardly seems as if any one could manage such a monster; but\nit looks easy, after you have seen it done. An enormous horizontal\nwheel revolves slowly. On its edge are moulds shaped like bricks, but\nmuch larger. On the hub of the wheel a workman sits to direct the\nfilling of these. A set of them is filled, and moves on, and others\ntake their place. When they are partly cooled, another workman, at the\nfarther side of the wheel, pries them out of the mould and drops them\ninto water. Then by the aid of the fingers of a machine and those of\nmen, they are loaded upon cars.\n\nIn copper there is often some gold and silver. The precious metals do\nnot make the copper any better, and if they can be separated from it,\nthey are well worth the trouble. This is done by electricity. It is so\nsuccessful that the metallurgists are hoping soon to take a long step\nahead and by means of electricity to produce refined copper directly\nfrom the ore. Indeed, this has been done already in the laboratories,\nbut before the managers of mines can employ the method, a way of\nmaking it less expensive must be discovered.\n\nNo mine that wastes anything is as well managed as it might be; and\nsuperintendents are constantly on the watch for cheaper methods and\nfor ways to make the refuse matter of use. Even the scoria, or slag\nfrom the furnaces, has been found to be good for something, and now it\nis made into a coarse sort of brick that for certain rough uses is of\nvalue. By the way, the shaft of a copper mine, the Red Jacket, has\nshown itself of use in a manner that no one expected, namely, it helps\nto prove that the earth turns around. This shaft is the deepest mining\nshaft in the world, and when you get into the cage, you go down a full\nmile toward the center of the earth. If you drop any article into the\nshaft, it always strikes the east side before reaching the bottom. The\nonly way to explain this is that the earth turns toward the east.\n\nCopper mixed with zinc forms brass, which is harder than copper alone.\nIt tarnishes, though not so easily as copper; but a coat of varnish\nwill protect it till the varnish wears off. A good way to find out the\nmany uses of brass and to see how valuable they are is to go along the\nstreet and through a house and make a list. On the street you will see\nsigns, harness buckles, and buttons, everywhere. Look on the\nautomobiles and fire engines for a fine display of brass, polished and\nshining. In the house you will find brass bedsteads, curtain rods,\nfaucets, pipes, drawerpulls, candlesticks, gas and electric fixtures,\nlamps, the works of clocks and watches, and scores of other things.\nYou will not have any idea how many they are till you begin to count.\n\nCopper mixed with tin forms bronze. Go into a hardware store and look\nat the samples of bronze outside of each drawer, and you will be\nsurprised that there are so many. Bronze does not change even when in\nthe open air for ages. That is one reason why it has always been so\nmuch used for statues. There are two strange facts about this mixture.\nOne is that bronze is harder than either copper or tin. The other is\nthat if you mix one pint of melted copper with one pint of tin, the\nmixture will be less than a quart. Just why these things are so, no\none is quite certain. Mathematics declares that the whole is equal to\nthe sum of its parts; but in this one case the whole seems to be less\nthan the sum of its parts.\n\nAnother reason why bronze is so much used for statues is that the\ncastings are smooth. I once went to a foundry to have a brass ornament\nshaped somewhat like a cone made for a clock. The foundryman formed a\nmould in clay and poured the melted brass into it. When it had cooled,\nthe mould was broken off and the ornament taken out; but it was of no\nuse because it was so full of little hollows that it could not be made\nsmooth without cutting away a great deal of it. The man had to try\nthree times before he succeeded in making one that could be polished.\nIf it had been made of bronze, there would have been no trouble,\nbecause bronze, hard as it is after it cools, flows when it is melted\nalmost as easily as molasses and fills every little nook and corner of\nthe mould.\n\nA famous Latin poet named Horace, who lived two thousand years ago,\nwrote of his poems, \"I have reared a monument more lasting than\nbronze\"; and he was right, for few statues have endured from his day\nto ours, but his poems are still read and admired.\n\nBells are made of bronze, about three quarters copper and one quarter\ntin. It is thought that much copper gives a deep, full tone, and that\nmuch tin with, sometimes, zinc makes the tone sharp. The age of a bell\nhas something to do with its sound being rich and mellow; but the\nbellmaker has even more, for he must understand not only how to cast\nit, but also how to tune it. If you tap a large bell, it will, if\nproperly tuned, sound a clear note. Tap it just on the curve of the\ntop, and it will give a note exactly one octave above the first. If\nthe note of the bell is too low, it can be made higher by cutting away\na little from the inner rim. If it is too high, it can be made lower\nby filing on the inside a little above the rim. Many of the old bells\ncontain the gifts of silver and gold which were thrown in by people\nwho watched their founding. The most famous bell in the United States\nis the \"Liberty Bell\" of Independence Hall, in Philadelphia, which\nrang when Independence was adopted by Congress. This was founded in\nEngland long before the Revolution and later was melted and founded\nagain in the United States.\n\nIt would not be easy to get on without brass and bronze; but even\nthese alloys are not so necessary as copper by itself. It is so strong\nthat it is used in boiler tubes of locomotives, as roofing for\nbuildings and railroad coaches, in the great pans and vats of the\nsugar factories and refineries. A copper ore called \"malachite,\" which\nshows many shades of green, beautifully blended and mingled, is used\nfor the tops of tables. Wooden ships are often \"copper-bottomed\"; that\nis, sheets of copper are nailed to that part of the hull which is\nunder water in order to prevent barnacles from making their homes on\nit, and so lessening the speed of the vessel.\n\nPeople often say that the latter half of the nineteenth century was\nthe Age of Steel, because so many new uses for steel were found at\nthat time. The twentieth century promises to be the Age of\nElectricity, and electricity must have copper. Formerly iron was used\nfor telegraph wires; but it needs much more electricity to carry power\nor light or heat or a telegraphic message over an iron wire than one\nof copper. Moreover, iron will rust and will not stretch in storms\nlike copper, and so needs renewing much oftener. Electric lighting and\nthe telephone are everywhere, even on the summits of mountains and in\nmines a mile below the earth's surface. Electric power, if a\nwaterfall furnishes the electricity, is the cheapest power known. The\ncommon blue vitriol is one form of copper, and to this we owe many of\nour electric conveniences. It is used in all wet batteries, and so it\nrings our doorbells for us. It also sprays our apple and peach trees,\nand is a very valuable article. Indeed, copper in all its forms, pure\nand alloyed, is one of our best and most helpful friends.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE NEW METAL, ALUMINUM\n\n\nNot many years ago a college boy read about an interesting metal\ncalled \"aluminum.\" It was as strong as iron, but weighed only one\nthird as much, and moisture would not make it rust. It was made of a\nsubstance called \"alumina,\" and a French chemist had declared that the\nclay banks were full of it; and yet it cost as much as silver. It had\nbeen used in France for jewelry and knicknacks, and a rattle of it had\nbeen presented to the baby son of the Emperor of France as a great\nrarity.\n\nThe college boy thought by day and dreamed by night of the metal that\nwas everywhere, but that might as well be nowhere, so far as getting\nat it was concerned. At the age of twenty-one, the young man\ngraduated, but even his new diploma could not keep his mind away from\naluminum. He borrowed the college laboratory and set to work. For\nseven or eight months he tried mixing the metal with various\nsubstances to see if it would not dissolve. At length he tried a stone\nfrom Greenland called \"cryolite,\" which had already been used for\nmaking a kind of porcelain. The name of this stone comes from two\nGreek words meaning \"ice stone,\" and it is so called because it melts\nso easily. The young student melted it and found that it would\ndissolve alumina. Then he ran an electric current through the melted\nmass, and there was a deposit of aluminum. This young man, just out of\ncollege, had discovered a process that resulted in reducing the cost\nof aluminum from twelve dollars a pound to eighteen cents. Meanwhile a\nFrenchman of the same age had been working away by himself, and made\nthe same discovery only two months later.\n\nAluminum is now made from a mineral called \"bauxite,\" found chiefly in\nGeorgia, Alabama, and Arkansas. Mining it is much more agreeable than\ncoal mining, for the work is done aboveground. The bauxite is in beds\nor strata which often cover the hills like a blanket. First of all,\nthe mine is \"stripped,\"--that is, the soil which covers the ore is\nremoved,--and then the mining is done in great steps eight or ten feet\nhigh, if a hill is to be worked. There is some variety in mining\nbauxite, for it occurs in three forms. First, it may be a rock, which\nhas to be blasted in order to loosen it. Second, it may be in the form\nof gray or red clay. Third, it occurs in round masses, sometimes no\nlarger than peas, and sometimes an inch in diameter. In this form it\ncan easily be loosened with a pickaxe, and shoveled into cars to be\ncarried to the mill. Bauxite is a rather mischievous mineral and\nsometimes acts as if it delighted in playing tricks upon managers of\nmines. The ore may not change in the least in its appearance, and yet\nit may suddenly have become much richer or much poorer. Therefore the\nsuperintendent has to give his ore a chemical test every little while\nto make sure that all things are going on well.\n\nThis bauxite is purified, and the result is a fine white powder, which\nis pure alumina, and consists of the metal aluminum and the gas\noxygen. Cryolite is now melted by electricity. The white powder is put\ninto it, and dissolves just as sugar dissolves in water. The\nelectricity keeps on working, and now it separates the alumina into\nits two parts. The aluminum is a little heavier than the melted\ncryolite, and therefore it settles and may be drawn off at the bottom\nof the melting-pot.\n\nThere are a good many reasons why aluminum is useful. As has been said\nit is strong and light and does not rust in moisture. You can beat it\ninto sheets as thin as gold leaf, and you can draw it into the finest\nwire. It is softer than silver, and it can be punched into almost any\nform. It is the most accommodating of metals. You can hammer it in the\ncold until it becomes as hard as soft iron. Then, if you need to have\nit soft again, it will become so by melting. It takes a fine polish\nand is not affected, as silver is, by the fumes which are thrown off\nby burning coal; and so keeps its color when silver would turn black.\nSalt water does not hurt it in the least, and few of the acids affect\nit. Another good quality is that it conducts electricity excellently.\nIt is true that copper will do the same work with a smaller wire; but\nthe aluminum is much lighter and so cheap that the larger wire of\naluminum costs less than the smaller one of copper, and its use for\nthis purpose is on the increase. It conducts heat as well as silver.\nIf you put one spoon of aluminum, one of silver, and one that is\n\"plated\" into a cup of hot water, the handles of the first two will\nalmost burn your fingers before the third is at all uncomfortable to\ntouch.\n\n[Illustration: A \"MOVIE\" OF AN ALUMINUM FUNNEL\n\n_Courtesy The Aluminum Cooking Utensil Company._\n\nSeventeen other operations are necessary after the thirteenth stamping\noperation before the funnel is ready to be sold. And after all this\nwork, we can buy it for 35 cents at any hardware store.]\n\nAluminum is found not only in clay and indeed in most rocks except\nsandstone and limestone, but also in several of the precious stones,\nin the yellow topaz, the blue sapphire and lapis-lazuli, and the red\ngarnet and ruby. It might look down upon some of its metallic\nrelatives, but it is friendly with them all, and perfectly willing to\nform alloys with most of them. A single ounce of it put into a ton of\nsteel as the latter is being poured out will drive away the gases\nwhich often make little holes in castings. Mixed with copper it makes\na beautiful bronze which has the yellow gleam of gold, but is hard to\nwork. When a piece of jewelry looks like gold, but is sold at too low\na price to be \"real,\" it may be aluminum bronze, very pretty at first,\nbut before long its luster will vanish. Aluminum bronze is not good\nfor jewelry, but it is good for many uses, especially for bearings in\nmachinery. Aluminum mixed with even a very little silver has the color\nand brightness of silver. The most common alloys with aluminum are\nzinc, copper, and manganese, but in such small quantities that they do\nnot change its appearance.\n\nWith so many good qualities and so few bad ones, it is small wonder\nthat aluminum is employed for more purposes than can be counted. A\nvery few years ago it was only an interesting curiosity, but now it is\none of the hardest-worked metals. Automobiles in particular owe a\ngreat deal to its help. When they first began to be common, in\n1904-05, the engines were less powerful than they are now made, and\naluminum was largely employed in order to lessen the weight. Before\nlong it was in use for carburetors, bodies, gear-boxes, fenders,\nhoods, and many other parts of the machine. Makers of electric\napparatus use aluminum instead of brass. The frames of opera glasses\nand of cameras are made of it. Travelers and soldiers and campers,\npeople to whom every extra ounce of weight counts, are glad enough to\nhave dishes of aluminum. The accommodating metal is even used for\n\"wallpaper,\" and threads of it are combined with silk to give a\nspecially brilliant effect on the stage. It can be made into a paint\nwhich will protect iron from rust; and will make woodwork partially\nfireproof.\n\nAluminum has been gladly employed by the manufacturers of all sorts of\narticles, but nowhere has its welcome been more cordial than in the\nkitchen. Any one who has ever lifted the heavy iron kettles which were\nin use not so very many years ago will realize what an improvement it\nis to have kettles made of aluminum. But aluminum has other advantages\nbesides its lightness. If any food containing a weak acid, like\nvinegar and water, is put into a copper kettle, some of the copper\ndissolves and goes into the food; acid does not affect aluminum except\nto brighten it if it has been discolored by an alkali like soda. \"Tin\"\ndishes, so called, are only iron with a coating of tin. The tin soon\nwears off, and the iron rusts; aluminum does not rust in moisture. A\nstrong alkali will destroy it, but no alkali in common use in the\nkitchen is strong enough to do more harm than to change the color, and\na weak acid will restore that. Enameled ware, especially if it is\nwhite, looks dainty and attractive; but the enamel is likely to chip\noff, and, too, if the dish \"boils dry,\" the food in it and the dish\nitself are spoiled. Aluminum never chips, and it holds the heat in\nsuch a manner as to make all parts of the dish equally hot. Food,\nthen, is not so likely to \"burn down,\" but if it does, only the part\nthat sticks will taste scorched; and no matter how many times a dish\n\"boils dry,\" it will never break. If you make a dent in it, you can\neasily pound it back into shape again. It is said that an aluminum\nteakettle one sixteenth of an inch in diameter can be bent almost\ndouble before it will break.\n\nAluminum dishes are made in two ways. Sometimes they are cast, and\nsometimes they are drawn on a machine. If one is to be smaller at the\ntop, as in the case of a coffeepot, it is drawn out into a cylinder,\nthen put on a revolving spindle. As it whirls around, a tool is held\nagainst it wherever it is to be made smaller, and very soon the\ncoffeepot is in shape. The spout is soldered on, but even the solder\nis made chiefly of aluminum.\n\nAluminum dishes may become battered and bruised, but they need never\nbe thrown away. There is an old story of some enchanted slippers which\nbrought misfortune to whoever owned them. The man who possessed them\ntried his best to get rid of the troublesome articles, but they always\nreturned. So it is with an aluminum dish. Bend it, burn it, put acid\ninto it, do what you will to get rid of it, but like the slippers it\nremains with you. Unlike them, however, it brings good fortune,\nbecause it saves time and trouble and patience and money.\n\nA few years ago the motive power for most manufactures was steam.\nElectricity is rapidly taking its place; and if aluminum was good for\nnothing else save to act as a conductor of electricity in its various\napplications, there would even then be a great future before it.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHE OIL IN OUR LAMPS\n\n\nProbably the first man who went to a spring for a drink and found oil\nfloating on the water was decidedly annoyed. He did not care in the\nleast where the oil came from or what it was good for; he was thirsty,\nand it had spoiled his drink, and that was enough for him. We know now\nthat oil comes chiefly from strata of coarse sandstone, but we are not\nquite sure how it happened to be there. The sand which formed these\nstrata was deposited by water ages and ages ago--we are certain of\nthat. Another thing that we are certain of is that where the strata\nlie flat, there is no oil. Hot substances become smaller as they cool;\nand as the earth grew cooler, it became smaller. The crust of the\nearth wrinkled as the skin of an apple does when it dries. In the tops\nof these great sandstone wrinkles there is often gas; and below the\ngas is the place where oil is found. There is no use in looking for\npetroleum where the folds of the strata are very sharp, because in\nthat case the strata crack and let the oil flow away. It is not in\npools, but the porous stone holds it just as a sponge holds water. If\nyou drop a little oil upon a stone even much less porous than\nsandstone, it will not be easy to wipe it off, because some of it will\nhave sunk into the stone.\n\nIn many places the gas forces its way out, and is piped to carry to\nhouses for light and heat. Not far above Niagara Falls there was a\nspring of gas which flowed for years. An iron pipe was put down, and\nwhen the gas was lighted, the flame shot up three or four feet. The\ngas came with such force that a handkerchief put over the end of the\npipe would not burn, though the flame would blaze away above it. In\nthe country of the fire worshipers, on the shores of the Caspian Sea,\nfires of natural gas have been burning for ages, kindled, perhaps, by\nlightning centuries ago. There is a vast supply of oil in this place;\nand indeed there is hardly a country that has not more or less of it.\n\nIn the United States the colonists soon learned that there was\npetroleum in what is now the State of New York; but New York was a\nlong way from the Atlantic seaboard in those days, and they went on\ncontentedly burning candles or sperm whale oil, or, a little later, a\nrather dangerous liquid which was known as \"fluid.\" The Indians\nbelieved that the oil which appeared in the springs was a good\nmedicine. They threw their blankets upon the water, and when these had\nbecome saturated with the oil, they wrung them out and sold the oil.\nThose were the times when if a medicine only tasted and smelled bad\nenough, people never doubted that it would cure all their diseases,\nand they gladly bought the oil of the Indians.\n\nWhen at last it became clear to the members of an enterprising company\nthat oil for use in lamps could be made from petroleum, they secured\nsome land in Pennsylvania that seemed promising and set to work to\ndig a well. But the more they dug, the more the loose dirt fell in\nupon them. Fortunately for the company, the superintendent had brains,\nand he thought out a way to get the better of the crumbling soil. He\nsimply drove down an iron pipe to the sandstone which contained the\noil, and set his borer at work within the pipe. One morning he found\nthat the oil had gushed in nearly to the top of the well. He had\n\"struck oil.\"\n\nThis was about ten years after the rush to California for gold, and\nnow that this cheaper and quicker method of making a well had been\ninvented, there was almost as much of a rush to Pennsylvania for oil.\nWith every penny that they could beg or borrow, people from the East\nhurried to the westward to buy or lease a piece of land in the hope of\nmaking their fortunes. A song of the day had for its refrain,--\n\n    \"Stocks par, stocks up,\n      Then on the wane;\n    Everybody's troubled with\n      Oil on the brain.\"\n\nIn the course of a year or two, the first \"gusher\" was discovered. The\nworkmen had drilled down some four or five hundred feet and were\nworking away peacefully, when a furious stream of oil burst forth\nwhich hurled the tools high up into the air. Hundreds of barrels\ngushed out every day, and soon other gushers were discovered. The most\nfamous one in the world is at Lakeview, California. For months it\nproduced fifty thousand barrels of oil a day, and threw it up three\nhundred and fifty feet into the air in a black column, spraying the\ncountry with oil for a mile around. The oil flowed away in a river,\nand for a time no one could plan any way to stop it or store it. At\nlast, however, a mammoth tank was built around the well and made firm\nwith stones and bags of earth. This was soon full of oil; and with all\nthis vast weight of oil pressing down upon it, the stream could not\nrise more than a few feet above the surface. Just why oil should come\nout with such force, the geologists are not quite certain; but it is\nthought to result from a pressure of gas upon the sandstone containing\nit. The flow almost always becomes less and less, and after a time the\nmost generous well has to be pumped.\n\n[Illustration: A CALIFORNIA OIL FIELD\n\nFor scenery, one should not go to an oil field. Looks, smell, and oil\nalike are unpleasant, but every oil derrick covers a fortune and helps\nto make our machinery run smoothly.]\n\nAn \"oil field\" may extend over thousands of square miles; but within\nthis field there are always \"pools\"; that is, certain smaller fields,\nwhere oil is found. When a man thinks there is oil in a certain spot,\nsometimes he buys the land if he is able; but oftener he gets\npermission of the owner to bore a well, agreeing to pay him a royalty;\nthat is, a certain percentage of all the oil that is produced. When\nthis has been arranged, he builds his derrick. This consists of four\nstrong upright beams firmly held together by crossbeams. It stands\ndirectly over the place where the well is to be dug. It is from thirty\nto eighty feet in height, according to the depth at which it is hoped\nto find oil. There must also be an engine house to provide the power\nfor drilling. An iron pipe eight or ten inches in diameter is driven\ndown through the soil until it comes to rock. Now the regular drilling\nbegins. At the top of the derrick is a pulley. Over the pulley passes\na stout rope to which the heavy drilling tools--the \"string of tools,\"\nas they are called--are fastened. The drilling goes on day and night.\nThe drill makes the hole, and the sand pump sucks out the water and\nloose bits of stone. When the drill has gone to the bottom of the\nstrata which carry water, the sides of the bore are cased to keep the\nwater out; then the drilling continues, but now the drill makes its\nway into the oil-bearing sandstone.\n\nThere is nothing certain about the search for oil. In some places it\nis near the surface, in others it is perhaps three or four thousand\nfeet down. The well may prove to be a gusher and pour out hundreds of\nthousands of gallons a day; or the oil may refuse to rise to the\nsurface and have to be pumped out even at the first. Naturally, no one\nis prepared for a gusher, and millions of gallons have often flowed\naway before any arrangements could be made for storing the oil.\nSometimes a well that gives only a moderate flow can be made to yield\ngenerously by exploding a heavy charge of dynamite at the bottom, to\nbreak up the rock and, it is always hoped, to open some new\noil-holding crevice that the drill has not reached.\n\nCrude petroleum is a dark, disagreeable, bad-smelling liquid; and\nbefore it can be of much use, it must be refined. For several years it\nwas carried in barrels from the oil fields to Pittsburgh by wagon and\nboat, a slow, expensive process, and generally unsatisfactory to all\nbut the teamsters. Then came the railroads. They provided iron tanks\nin the shape of a cylinder fastened to freight cars, much like those\nemployed to-day. There was only one difficulty about sending oil by\nrail, and that was that it still had to be hauled by team to the\nrailroad, sometimes a number of miles. At length, some one said to\nhimself, \"Why cannot we simply run a pipe directly from the well to\nthe railroad?\" This was done. Pumping engines were put in a few miles\napart, and the invention was a success in the eyes of all but the\nteamsters. In spite of their opposition, however, pipe-lines\nincreased.\n\nBefore this it had been necessary to build the refineries as near the\noil regions as possible in order to save the expense of carrying the\noil; but now they could be built wherever it was most convenient.\nTo-day oil can be brought at a small expense from west of the\nMississippi River to the Atlantic seaboard, refined, and distributed\nthroughout that part of the country, or loaded into \"tankers,\"--that\nis, steamships containing strong tanks of steel,--and so taken across\nthe ocean. The pipes are made of iron and are six or eight inches or\nmore in diameter. In using them one difficulty was found which has\nbeen overcome in an ingenious fashion. Sometimes they become choked by\nthe impurities of the oil and the flow is lessened. Then a \"go-devil\"\nis put into them. This is shaped like a cartridge, is about three\nfeet in length, composed of springs and plates of iron and so flexible\nthat it can turn around a corner. It is so made that as it slips down\nthe current of oil, it whirls around and in so doing its nose of sharp\nblades scrapes the pipes clean.\n\nThe pipes go over hills and through swamps. They cross rivers\nsometimes by means of bridges, and sometimes they are anchored to the\nbed of the stream. If they have to go through a salt marsh, they are\nlaid in concrete to preserve the iron. If these lines were suddenly\ndestroyed and oil had to be carried in the old way, kerosene would\nbecome an expensive luxury.\n\nGetting the oil out of the ground and carried to the refineries is not\nall of the business by any means. The early oils crusted on the lamp\nwicks, their smell was unendurable, and they were given to exploding.\nEvidently, if oil was to be used for lighting, it must be improved,\nand the first step was to distil it. To distil anything means to boil\nit and collect the vapor. If you hold a piece of cold earthenware in\nthe steam of a teakettle, water will collect on it. This is distilled\nwater, and is purer than that in the kettle. Petroleum was at first\ndistilled in a rough way; but now it is done with the utmost care and\nexactness. The crude oil is pumped into boilers holding six hundred\nbarrels or more. The fires are started, and the oil soon begins to\nturn into vapor. This vapor passes through coils of pipe or long,\nstraight, parallel pipes. Cold water is pumped over these pipes, the\nvapor turns into a liquid again, and we have kerosene oil.\n\nThis is the outline of the process, but it is a small part of the\nactual work in all its details. Kerosene oil is only one of the many\nsubstances found in petroleum. Fortunately, some of these substances\nare light, like gasoline and benzine; some, like kerosene, are\nheavier; and paraffin and tar are heaviest of all. There are also\ngases, which pass off first and are saved to help keep the furnace\ngoing. Then come the others, one by one, according to their weight.\nThe stillman keeps close watch, and when the color and appearance of\nthe distillate changes, he turns it off into another tank. This\nprocess is called \"fractional distillation,\" and the various products\nare called \"fractions.\" No two kinds of petroleum and no two oil wells\nare just alike, and it needs a skillful man to manage either.\n\nEven after all this distillation, the kerosene still chars the wick\nsomewhat--which prevents the wick from drawing up the oil\nproperly--and it still has a disagreeable smell. To fit it for burning\nin lamps, it must be treated with sulphuric acid, which carries away\nsome of the impurities, and then with caustic soda, which carries away\nothers. Before it can be put on the market, it is examined to see\nwhether it is of the proper color. Then come three important tests.\nThe first is to see that it is of the proper weight. If it is too\nheavy, it will not burn freely enough; if it is too light, then there\nis too much of the lighter oils in it for safety. The second test is\nthe \"flash test.\" The object of this is to see how hot the oil must be\nbefore it gives off a vapor which will burn. The third, the \"burning\ntest,\" is to discover how hot the oil must be before it will take fire\nand burn on the surface. Most civilized countries make definite laws\nforbidding the sale of kerosene oil that is not up to a standard of\nsafety. Oil for use in lamps should have an open flash test of at\nleast 100\u00c2\u00b0 F. and a burning point of not less than 125\u00c2\u00b0 F.\n\nWe say that we burn oil in our lamps, but what we really do is to heat\nthe oil until it gives off gas, and then we burn the gas. To keep the\nflame regular and help on the burning, we use a chimney on the lamp.\nThe hot air rises in the chimney and the cold air underneath rushes in\nto take its place and brings oxygen to the flame. In a close, stuffy\nroom no lamp will give a good clear light, because there is not oxygen\nenough for its flame. Let in fresh air, and the light will be\nbrighter. If you hold a cold plate in the flame before the chimney is\nput on, soot or carbon will be deposited. A lamp gives light because\nthese particles of carbon become so hot that they glow. In lamps using\na \"mantle,\" there is the glow not only of these particles, but also of\nthe mantle. In a wax candle, we light the wick, its heat melts the wax\nand carries it to the flame. When the wax is made hot enough, it\nbecomes gas, and we burn the gas, not the wax. Wax alone will melt,\nbut not take fire even if a burning match is held to it. The reason is\nthat the match does not give heat enough to turn the wax into gas. But\nput a bit of wax upon a bed of burning coals, where there is a good\nsupply of heat, and it will turn into gas and burn.\n\nThe products made from petroleum are as different in their character\nand uses as paraffin and naphtha. Some of them are used for oiling\nmachinery; tar is used for dyes; naphtha dissolves resin to use in\nvarnish; benzine is the great cleanser of clothes, printers' types,\nand almost everything else; gasoline runs automobiles, motors, and\nmany sorts of engines; paraffin makes candles, seals jelly glasses,\ncovers the heads of matches so that they are no longer spoiled by\nbeing wet, and makes the ever-useful \"waxed paper\"; printers' ink and\nwaterproof roofing-paper both owe a debt to petroleum. Even in\nmedicine, though a little petroleum is no longer looked upon as a\ncure-all, vaseline, one of its products, is of great value. It can be\nmixed with drugs without changing their character, and it does not\nbecome rancid. For these reasons, salves and other ointments can be\nmixed with it and preserved for years.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nLITTLE GRAINS OF SALT\n\n\nThe most interesting mine in the world is that of Wieliczka in Poland.\nIn it there are some thirty miles of streets and alleys; there are\nchurches with pillars, shrines, and statues; there are stairs,\nmonuments, and restaurants; there is a ballroom three hundred feet\nlong and one hundred and ninety feet high, with beautiful chandeliers,\nand in it is a carven throne whereon the Emperor Franz Joseph sat when\nhe visited the mine. There are lakes crossed by ferryboats. There is a\nrailroad station for the mule trains which bear the precious mineral\nsalt, for this is a salt mine, and shrines, statues, churches,\nchandeliers--everything--are all cut out of salt.\n\nThis mine has been worked for at least eight hundred years and still\nhas salt enough to supply all Europe for ages. The mass of salt is\nbelieved to be five hundred miles long, fifty miles wide, and nearly a\nquarter of a mile thick. It is so pure that it is sold just as it\ncomes from the mine, either in blocks or finely ground. This mine is a\nwonderful place to visit, almost like an enchanted palace, for as the\ntorchlight strikes the crystals of salt, they flash and sparkle as if\nthe wall was covered with rubies and diamonds.\n\nThere is nothing like an enchanted palace in any salt mine of the\nUnited States, no statues or chapels or chandeliers. There is only a\nhole in the ground, where mining is carried on in much the same manner\nas in other kinds of mines. The shaft is sunk and lined with timbers\nto keep the dirt from falling in, just as in other mines. In working\nsalt mines, however, water is almost as bad as earth, and therefore a\nlayer of clay is put between the timbers and the earth. There are the\nusual galleries and pillars, with roof and floor of salt. The workmen\ntry to get the salt out in lumps or blocks as far as possible, and so\nthey bore in drill holes and then blast with dynamite or powder. The\nsalt is loaded upon little cars, running on tracks, and is carried up\nthe shaft and to the top of a breaker, usually more than one hundred\nfeet above the surface of the ground. There it is dumped upon a screen\nof iron bars, which lets the fine salt fall through. The large lumps\nare sold without crushing or sifting, and are used for cattle and\nsheep.\n\nOne of the great deposits of salt is in southeastern California. It is\nthought that the Gulf of California used to run much farther north\nthan it now does, and that the earth rose, shutting away part of it\nfrom the ocean. This imprisoned water was full of salt. In time it\ndried, and the sand blew over it till it was far underground. A better\nway than digging was found to work it, as will be seen later; but\nwhile digging was going on, the workmen built a cottage of blocks of\nsalt, clear and glassy. The little rain that falls there melted the\nblocks only enough to unite them firmly together; and there the house\nhas stood for many years.\n\nCountries that have no deposits of rock salt can easily get plenty of\nsalt from the water of the ocean if they only have a seacoast. About\none thirtieth of the ocean water is salt, and if the water is\nevaporated, the salt can be collected without difficulty. France makes\na great deal of salt in this way. When a man goes into the\nmanufacture, or rather, the collecting of salt, he first of all buys\nor rents a piece of land,--perhaps several acres of it,--that lies\njust above high water, and makes it as level as possible. Unless it is\nvery firm land, he covers it with clay, so that the water will not\nsoak through it. Then he divides it into large square basins, making\neach a little lower than the one before it. Close beside the highest\nbasin he makes a reservoir which at high tide receives water from the\nocean. This flows slowly from the reservoir through one basin after\nanother, becoming more and more salt as the water evaporates. At\nlength the water is gone, and the salt remains. The workmen take\nwooden scrapers and push the salt toward the walls of the basins and\nthen shovel it up on the dikes and heap it into creamy cones that\nsparkle in the sunshine. The dikes are narrow, raised pathways beside\nthe basins and between them. As you walk along on top of them, you can\nsmell a faint violet perfume from the salt. Thatch is put over the\ncones to protect them from the rain, and there they stand till some of\nthe impurities drain away. This salt is not perfectly white, because\nthe workmen cannot help scraping up a little of the gray or reddish\nclay with it. Most of it is sold as it is, nevertheless, for many\npeople have an absurd notion that the darker it is the purer it is.\nFor those who wish to buy white salt it is sent to a refinery to be\nwashed with pure water, then boiled down and dried.\n\nSo it is that the sun helps to manufacture salt. In some of the colder\ncountries, frost does the same work, but in a very different manner.\nWhen salt water freezes, the _water_ freezes, but the salt does not,\nand a piece of salt water ice is almost as pure as that made of fresh\nwater. Of course, after part of the water in a basin of salt water has\nbeen frozen out, what is left is more salt than it was at first, and\nafter the freezing has been repeated several times, only a little\nwater remains, and evaporation will soon carry this away, leaving only\nsalt in the basin, waiting to be purified.\n\nNot very many years ago one of the encyclop\u00c3\u00a6dias remarked that \"the\ndeposits of salt in the United States are unimportant.\" This was true\nas far as the working of them was concerned, but in 1913 the United\nStates produced more than 34,000,000 barrels. Part of this was made by\nevaporation of the waters of salt springs, and a small share from\nGreat Salt Lake in Utah. The early settlers in Utah used to gather\nsalt from the shallow bays or lagoons where the water evaporated\nduring the summer; but now dams of earth hold back the water in a\nreservoir. In the spring the pumps are put to work and the reservoir\nis soon filled with water. This is left to stand and give the\nimpurities a chance to settle to the bottom. Then it is allowed to\nflow into smaller basins, while more water is pumped into the\nreservoir. When autumn comes, the crop of salt is ready to be\nharvested. It is in the form of a crust three to six inches thick,\nsome of it in large crystals, and some fine-grained. This crust is\nbroken by ploughs, and the salt is heaped up into great cones and left\nfor the rain to wash clean. Then it goes to the mill for purifying.\nThe water of Great Salt Lake is much more salty than that of the\nocean. It preserves timber remarkably well, and often salt from the\nlake is put around telephone poles, seventy-five pounds being dropped\ninto the hole for each one. It has been suggested to soak timber in\nthe Lake, and then paint it with creosote to keep the wet out and the\nsalt in.\n\nSalt is also made from the waters of salt springs, which the Indians\nthought were the homes of evil spirits. At Salton, in California, an\narea of more than one thousand acres, which lies two hundred and\nsixty-four feet below sea level, is flooded with water from salt\nsprings. When this water has evaporated, all these acres are covered\nwith salt ten to twenty inches thick, and as dazzlingly white as if it\nwas snow. This great field is ploughed up with a massive four-wheeled\nimplement called a \"salt-plough.\" It is run by steam and needs two men\nto manage it. The heavy steel ploughshare breaks up the salt crust,\nmaking broad, shallow furrows and throwing the salt in ridges on both\nsides. The plough has hardly moved on before the crust begins to form\nagain. This broken crust is worked in water by men with hoes in order\nto remove the bits of earth that stick to it, then piled up into cones\nto drain, loaded upon flat trucks, and carried to the breaker. The\nsalt fields are wonderfully beautiful in the moonlight, but not very\nagreeable to work in, for the mercury often reaches 140\u00c2\u00b0 F., and the\nair is so full of particles of salt that the workers feel an intense\nthirst, which the warm, brackish water does not satisfy. The work is\ndone by Indians and Japanese, for white people cannot endure the heat.\n\nA large portion of the salt used in the United States comes directly\nfrom rock salt strata, hundreds of feet below the surface of the\nground. These were perhaps the bed of the ocean ages and ages ago.\nThere is a great extent of the beds in New York, Michigan, Ohio,\nKansas, and other States. In Michigan there is a stratum of rock salt\nthirty to two hundred and fifty feet thick and some fifteen hundred to\ntwo thousand feet below the surface. To mine this would be a difficult\nand expensive undertaking, and a far better way has been discovered.\nFirst, a pipe is forced down through the surface dirt, the limestone,\nand the shale to the salt stratum. The drill works inside this pipe\nand bores a hole for a six-inch pipe directly into the salt. A\nthree-inch pipe is let down inside of the six-inch pipe, and water is\nforced down through the smaller pipe. It dissolves the salt, becomes\nbrine, and rises through the space between the two pipes. It is\ncarried through troughs to some great tanks, and from these it flows\ninto \"grain-settlers,\" then into the \"grainers\" proper, where the\ngrains of salt settle. At the bottom of the grainers are steam pipes,\nand these make the brine so hot that before long little crystals of\nsalt are seen floating on the surface of the water. Crystals form much\nbetter if the water is perfectly smooth, and to bring this about a\nvery little oil is poured into the grainer. It spreads over the\nsurface in the thinnest film that can be imagined. The water\nevaporates, and the tiny crystals grow, one joining to another as they\ndo in rock candy. When they become larger, they drop to the bottom of\nthe grainer. They are now swept along in a trough to a \"pocket,\"\ncarried up by an endless chain of buckets, and then wheeled away to\nthe packinghouse.\n\nThe finest salt is made by using vacuum pans. These are great cans out\nof which the air is pumped, and into which the brine flows. This\nbrine, heated by steam pipes, begins to boil, and as the steam from it\nrises, it has to pass through a pipe at the top and is thus carried\ninto a small tank into which cold water is flowing. The cold makes the\nsteam condense into water, which runs off. The condensed water\noccupies less space than the steam and so maintains the vacuum in the\npan. For a perfect vacuum the brine is boiled at less than 100\u00c2\u00b0 F.,\nwhile in an open pan or grainer it requires 226\u00c2\u00b0 to boil brine. The\nbrine is soon so rich in salt that tiny crystals begin to form. These\nare taken out and dried. If you look at some grains of table salt\nthrough a magnifying glass, you can see that each grain is a tiny\ncubical crystal. Sometimes two or three are united, and often the\ncorners are rounded off and worn, but they show plainly that they are\nlittle cubes.\n\nMost of the salt used on our tables is made by the vacuum process or\nby an improved method which produces tiny flakes of salt similar to\nsnowflakes. The salt brine is heated to a high temperature and\nfiltered. In the filters the impurities are taken out, and this\nprocess gives us very pure salt. The tiny flakes dissolve more easily\nthan the cubes of salt, and thus flavor food more readily.\n\nWith a few savage tribes salt is regarded as a great luxury, but with\nmost peoples it is looked upon as a necessity. Some of the early races\nthought a salt spring was a special gift of the gods, and in their\nsacrifices they always used salt. In later times to sit \"above the\nsalt,\" between the great ornamental salt cellar and the master of the\nhouse, was a mark of honor. Less distinguished guests were seated\n\"below the salt.\" To \"eat a man's salt\" and then be unfaithful to him\nhas always been looked upon as a shameful act; and with some of the\nsavages, so long as a stranger \"ate his salt,\"--that is, was a guest\nin the house of any one of them,--he was safe. To \"eat salt together\"\nis an expression of friendliness. Cakes of salt have been used as\nmoney in various parts of Africa and Asia. \"Attic salt\" means wit,\nbecause the Athenians, who lived in Attica, were famous for their\nkeen, delicate wit. To take a story or a statement \"with a grain of\nsalt\" means not to accept it entirely, but only to believe it\npartially. When Christ told his disciples that they were \"the salt of\nthe earth,\" he meant that their lives and teaching would influence\nothers just as salt affects every article of food and changes its\nflavor. Our word \"salary\" comes from the Latin word _sal_, meaning\nsalt; and _salarium_, or \"salt-money,\" was money given for paying\none's expenses on a journey. Living without salt would be a difficult\nmatter. Cattle that have been shut away from it for a while are almost\nwild to get it. Farmers living among the mountains sometimes drive\ntheir cattle to a mountain pasture to remain there through the summer,\nand every little while they go up to salt the animals. The cattle know\nthe call and know that it means salt; and I have seen them come\nrushing down the mountain-side and through the woods, over fallen\ntrees, through briers, and down slippery rocks, bellowing as they\ncame, and plunging head first in a wild frenzy to get to the pieces of\nrock salt that were waiting for them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nFIRST YEAR IN NUMBER\n\n35 cents net.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":821,"split":"train"}
