{"ori_id":"3eb3061b6357ba45ae3dc9d670e41b43f0299f01","title":"The Avengers (2012 film)","context":"The Avengers (2012 film)\n The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,\u00c2\u02db a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a couple of agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway.\nIn response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\". Agent Natasha Romanoff is sent to Calcutta to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract.\nIn Stuttgart, Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier. There Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.\nThe Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers try to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.\nThe Avengers rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location, but quickly realize they will be overwhelmed as wave after wave of Chitauri descend upon Earth. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together he, Rogers, Stark, Thor, Barton, and Romanoff battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed of Loki's control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing to the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master\u00c2\u0142 about the failed attack on Earth. In a post-credits scene, the Avengers eat in silence at a shawarma restaurant.\n<html>\n<head><title>Avengers, The (2012) Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Avengers, The (2012) script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Avengers, The (2012) script, Avengers, The (2012) movie script, Avengers, The (2012) film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The doors\n           open from both sides.\n          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the\n          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract\n          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both\n          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends\n          of the facility.\n          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and\n          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy\n          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS\n          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The\n          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then\n          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.\n          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of\n          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars\n          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding\n          everyone.\n          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the\n          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally\n          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.\n          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is\n          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.\n          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile\n          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and\n          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.\n\n<b>                          NICK FURY\n<\/b>           Sir, please put down the spear!\n          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury\n          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT\n          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss\n          Loki's fired shot.\n          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the\n          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the\n          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.\n          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his\n          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to\n          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost\n          gone to shit.\n          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton\n          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.\n\n<b>                          LOKI\n<\/b>           You have heart.\n          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's\n          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind\n          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands\n          straight.\n          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of\n          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,\n          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...\n\n<b>                          LOKI\n<\/b>           Please don't.
