Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard suspects a prank by three medical students whom Miss Cushing was forced to evict because of their unruly behaviour. The parcel was sent from Belfast, the city of origin of one of the former boarders. Upon examining the parcel himself, Holmes is convinced that it is evidence of a serious crime. He reasons that a medical student with access to a dissection laboratory would likely use something other than plain salt to preserve human remains, and would be able to make a more precise cut than the roughly hacked ears suggest. The address on the package, roughly written and with a spelling correction, suggests to Holmes that the sender lacks education and is unfamiliar with Croydon. The knot in the string suggests to Holmes that they are looking for someone with sailing experience.\nHolmes considers the solution so simple that he asks Lestrade not to mention his name in connection with it. A few simple questions to Miss Cushing, a few observations, a cable to Liverpool, and a visit to Miss Cushing's sister Sarah (Holmes was denied admittance by the doctor because she was having a \"brain fever\") convince Holmes that the ears belong to Miss Cushing's other sister, Mary, and her extramarital lover, and that they have been murdered. He is convinced that Mary's estranged husband, Jim Browner, is the murderer, and that Browner had sent the cardboard box containing the ears to the Cushings' house in Croydon (addressing it merely to \"S. Cushing\"), not realizing that Sarah was no longer resident there. Browner, who is an unpleasant man when drunk, had meant to horrify Sarah (rather than Susan) because he ultimately blamed Sarah for causing the trouble that culminated in his murder of his wife and her lover.\nBrowner is indeed a sailor, and Belfast was the first port where he had the chance to post the parcel. Lestrade, acting on Holmes's information, is waiting to arrest him when his ship reaches London. He confesses everything. He is presented with considerable sympathy, a simple man so tormented by guilt at his act that he would welcome being hanged. The real villain of the story \u00e2\u0080\u0094 morally if not legally \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is Sarah Cushing, who fell in love and tried to seduce Browner herself; then, when he rejected her advances, set out to wreck his marriage with her sister Mary, by poisoning her mind to her own husband and by introducing and pushing her onto a new lover, which she easily took to, especially given her husband's propensity for getting drunk (and being rather rough when so intoxicated). In the end, her husband's inability to accept her betrayal, and sheer jealousy at discovering the affair, causes him to commit what Sherlock considers a \"crime of passion\".\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Adventure of the Cardboard Box, by Arthur Conan Doyle\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It is,\nhowever, unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational\nfrom the criminal, and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must\neither sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so\ngive a false impression of the problem, or he must use matter which\nchance, and not choice, has provided him with.  With this short preface\nI shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a\npeculiarly terrible, chain of events.\n\nIt was a blazing hot day in August.  Baker Street was like an oven, and\nthe glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across\nthe road was painful to the eye.  It was hard to believe that these\nwere the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of\nwinter.  Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the\nsofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the\nmorning post.  For myself, my term of service in India had trained me\nto stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was no\nhardship.  But the morning paper was uninteresting.  Parliament had\nrisen. Everybody was out of town, and I yearned for the glades of the\nNew Forest or the shingle of Southsea.  A depleted bank account had\ncaused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the\ncountry nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him.  He\nloved to lie in the very center of five millions of people, with his\nfilaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to every\nlittle rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime.  Appreciation of nature\nfound no place among his many gifts, and his only change was when he\nturned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his\nbrother of the country.\n\nFinding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had tossed aside\nthe barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I fell into a brown\nstudy.  Suddenly my companion's voice broke in upon my thoughts:\n\n\"You are right, Watson,\" said he.  \"It does seem a most preposterous\nway of settling a dispute.\"\n\n\"Most preposterous!\" I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how he\nhad echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and\nstared at him in blank amazement.\n\n\"What is this, Holmes?\" I cried.  \"This is beyond anything which I\ncould have imagined.\"\n\nHe laughed heartily at my perplexity.\n\n\"You remember,\" said he, \"that some little time ago when I read you the\npassage in one of Poe's sketches in which a close reasoner follows the\nunspoken thoughts of his companion, you were inclined to treat the\nmatter as a mere tour-de-force of the author.  On my remarking that I\nwas constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed\nincredulity.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with your\neyebrows.  So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a\ntrain of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity of reading\nit off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof that I had been\nin rapport with you.\"\n\nBut I was still far from satisfied.  \"In the example which you read to\nme,\" said I, \"the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the\nman whom he observed. If I remember right, he stumbled over a heap of\nstones, looked up at the stars, and so on.  But I have been seated\nquietly in my chair, and what clues can I have given you?\"\n\n\"You do yourself an injustice.  The features are given to man as the\nmeans by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful\nservants.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my\nfeatures?\"\n\n\"Your features and especially your eyes.  Perhaps you cannot yourself\nrecall how your reverie commenced?\"\n\n\"No, I cannot.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you.  After throwing down your paper, which was the\naction which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a\nvacant expression.  Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly\nframed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your\nface that a train of thought had been started.  But it did not lead\nvery far.  Your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of Henry\nWard Beecher which stands upon the top of your books.  Then you glanced\nup at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious.  You were\nthinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare\nspace and correspond with Gordon's picture there.\"\n\n\"You have followed me wonderfully!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"So far I could hardly have gone astray.  But now your thoughts went\nback to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the\ncharacter in his features. Then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you\ncontinued to look across, and your face was thoughtful.  You were\nrecalling the incidents of Beecher's career.  I was well aware that you\ncould not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on\nbehalf of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember your\nexpressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was\nreceived by the more turbulent of our people.  You felt so strongly\nabout it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of\nthat also.  When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the\npicture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War,\nand when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your\nhands clenched I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the\ngallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. But\nthen, again, your face grew sadder, you shook your head.  You were\ndwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life.  Your\nhand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your\nlips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of\nsettling international questions had forced itself upon your mind. At\nthis point I agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to\nfind that all my deductions had been correct.\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\" said I.  \"And now that you have explained it, I confess\nthat I am as amazed as before.\"\n\n\"It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you.  I should not\nhave intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity\nthe other day.  But I have in my hands here a little problem which may\nprove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in thought\nreading.  Have you observed in the paper a short paragraph referring to\nthe remarkable contents of a packet sent through the post to Miss\nCushing, of Cross Street, Croydon?\"\n\n\"No, I saw nothing.\"\n\n\"Ah! then you must have overlooked it.  Just toss it over to me. Here\nit is, under the financial column.  Perhaps you would be good enough to\nread it aloud.\"\n\nI picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the\nparagraph indicated. It was headed, \"A Gruesome Packet.\"\n\n\"Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been made the\nvictim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical\njoke unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to\nthe incident.  At two o'clock yesterday afternoon a small packet,\nwrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman.  A cardboard box\nwas inside, which was filled with coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss\nCushing was horrified to find two human ears, apparently quite freshly\nsevered.  The box had been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the\nmorning before.  There is no indication as to the sender, and the\nmatter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of\nfifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or\ncorrespondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything\nthrough the post.  Some years ago, however, when she resided at Penge,\nshe let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom\nshe was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular\nhabits.  The police are of opinion that this outrage may have been\nperpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge\nand who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the\ndissecting-rooms.  Some probability is lent to the theory by the fact\nthat one of these students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the\nbest of Miss Cushing's belief, from Belfast.  In the meantime, the\nmatter is being actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very\nsmartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.\"\n\n\"So much for the Daily Chronicle,\" said Holmes as I finished reading.\n\"Now for our friend Lestrade.  I had a note from him this morning, in\nwhich he says:\n\n\"I think that this case is very much in your line.  We have every hope\nof clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty in getting\nanything to work upon.  We have, of course, wired to the Belfast\npost-office, but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that\nday, and they have no means of identifying this particular one, or of\nremembering the sender.  The box is a half-pound box of honeydew\ntobacco and does not help us in any way.  The medical student theory\nstill appears to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a\nfew hours to spare I should be very happy to see you out here.  I shall\nbe either at the house or in the police-station all day.\n\n\"What say you, Watson?  Can you rise superior to the heat and run down\nto Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?\"\n\n\"I was longing for something to do.\"\n\n\"You shall have it then.  Ring for our boots and tell them to order a\ncab.  I'll be back in a moment when I have changed my dressing-gown and\nfilled my cigar-case.\"\n\nA shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat was far\nless oppressive in Croydon than in town.  Holmes had sent on a wire, so\nthat Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-like as ever, was\nwaiting for us at the station.  A walk of five minutes took us to Cross\nStreet, where Miss Cushing resided.\n\nIt was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and prim,\nwith whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned women gossiping\nat the doors.  Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and tapped at a door,\nwhich was opened by a small servant girl.  Miss Cushing was sitting in\nthe front room, into which we were ushered.  She was a placid-faced\nwoman, with large, gentle eyes, and grizzled hair curving down over her\ntemples on each side.  A worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a\nbasket of coloured silks stood upon a stool beside her.\n\n\"They are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,\" said she as Lestrade\nentered.  \"I wish that you would take them away altogether.\"\n\n\"So I shall, Miss Cushing.  I only kept them here until my friend, Mr.\nHolmes, should have seen them in your presence.\"\n\n\"Why in my presence, sir?\"\n\n\"In case he wished to ask any questions.\"\n\n\"What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know nothing\nwhatever about it?\"\n\n\"Quite so, madam,\" said Holmes in his soothing way.  \"I have no doubt\nthat you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business.\"\n\n\"Indeed I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and live a retired life. It is\nsomething new for me to see my name in the papers and to find the\npolice in my house.  I won't have those things in here, Mr. Lestrade.\nIf you wish to see them you must go to the outhouse.\"\n\nIt was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the house.\nLestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box, with a piece\nof brown paper and some string.  There was a bench at the end of the\npath, and we all sat down while Homes examined one by one, the articles\nwhich Lestrade had handed to him.\n\n\"The string is exceedingly interesting,\" he remarked, holding it up to\nthe light and sniffing at it.  \"What do you make of this string,\nLestrade?\"\n\n\"It has been tarred.\"\n\n\"Precisely.  It is a piece of tarred twine.  You have also, no doubt,\nremarked that Miss Cushing has cut the cord with a scissors, as can be\nseen by the double fray on each side.  This is of importance.\"\n\n\"I cannot see the importance,\" said Lestrade.\n\n\"The importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact, and that\nthis knot is of a peculiar character.\"\n\n\"It is very neatly tied.  I had already made a note of that effect,\"\nsaid Lestrade complacently.\n\n\"So much for the string, then,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"now for the box\nwrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee. What, did you\nnot observe it?  I think there can be no doubt of it.  Address printed\nin rather straggling characters:  'Miss S. Cushing, Cross Street,\nCroydon.'  Done with a broad-pointed pen, probably a J, and with very\ninferior ink.  The word 'Croydon' has been originally spelled with an\n'i', which has been changed to 'y'.  The parcel was directed, then, by\na man--the printing is distinctly masculine--of limited education and\nunacquainted with the town of Croydon.  So far, so good!  The box is a\nyellow, half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two\nthumb marks at the left bottom corner.  It is filled with rough salt of\nthe quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser\ncommercial purposes.  And embedded in it are these very singular\nenclosures.\"\n\nHe took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across his\nknee he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending forward\non each side of him, glanced alternately at these dreadful relics and\nat the thoughtful, eager face of our companion.  Finally he returned\nthem to the box once more and sat for a while in deep meditation.\n\n\"You have observed, of course,\" said he at last, \"that the ears are not\na pair.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have noticed that.  But if this were the practical joke of some\nstudents from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for them to\nsend two odd ears as a pair.\"\n\n\"Precisely.  But this is not a practical joke.\"\n\n\"You are sure of it?\"\n\n\"The presumption is strongly against it.  Bodies in the\ndissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid.  These ears bear\nno signs of this.  They are fresh, too.  They have been cut off with a\nblunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a student had done it.\nAgain, carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which\nwould suggest themselves to the medical mind, certainly not rough salt.\nI repeat that there is no practical joke here, but that we are\ninvestigating a serious crime.\"\n\nA vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion's words and\nsaw the stern gravity which had hardened his features. This brutal\npreliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror\nin the background. Lestrade, however, shook his head like a man who is\nonly half convinced.\n\n\"There are objections to the joke theory, no doubt,\" said he, \"but\nthere are much stronger reasons against the other.  We know that this\nwoman has led a most quiet and respectable life at Penge and here for\nthe last twenty years.  She has hardly been away from her home for a\nday during that time.  Why on earth, then, should any criminal send her\nthe proofs of his guilt, especially as, unless she is a most consummate\nactress, she understands quite as little of the matter as we do?\"\n\n\"That is the problem which we have to solve,\" Holmes answered, \"and for\nmy part I shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is correct,\nand that a double murder has been committed.  One of these ears is a\nwoman's, small, finely formed, and pierced for an earring.  The other\nis a man's, sun-burned, discoloured, and also pierced for an earring.\nThese two people are presumably dead, or we should have heard their\nstory before now.  To-day is Friday.  The packet was posted on Thursday\nmorning.  The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday, or\nearlier.  If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would\nhave sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing?  We may take it that\nthe sender of the packet is the man whom we want. But he must have some\nstrong reason for sending Miss Cushing this packet.  What reason then?\nIt must have been to tell her that the deed was done! or to pain her,\nperhaps.  But in that case she knows who it is.  Does she know?  I\ndoubt it.  If she knew, why should she call the police in?  She might\nhave buried the ears, and no one would have been the wiser. That is\nwhat she would have done if she had wished to shield the criminal.  But\nif she does not wish to shield him she would give his name.  There is a\ntangle here which needs straightening out.\"  He had been talking in a\nhigh, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but now he\nsprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house.\n\n\"I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,\" said he.\n\n\"In that case I may leave you here,\" said Lestrade, \"for I have another\nsmall business on hand.  I think that I have nothing further to learn\nfrom Miss Cushing.  You will find me at the police-station.\"\n\n\"We shall look in on our way to the train,\" answered Holmes.  A moment\nlater he and I were back in the front room, where the impassive lady\nwas still quietly working away at her antimacassar.  She put it down on\nher lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank, searching blue\neyes.\n\n\"I am convinced, sir,\" she said, \"that this matter is a mistake, and\nthat the parcel was never meant for me at all.  I have said this\nseveral times to the gentlemen from Scotland Yard, but he simply laughs\nat me.  I have not an enemy in the world, as far as I know, so why\nshould anyone play me such a trick?\"\n\n\"I am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing,\" said Holmes,\ntaking a seat beside her.  \"I think that it is more than probable--\" He\npaused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to see that he was\nstaring with singular intentness at the lady's profile.  Surprise and\nsatisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face,\nthough when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he\nhad become as demure as ever.  I stared hard myself at her flat,\ngrizzled hair, her trim cap, her little gilt earrings, her placid\nfeatures; but I could see nothing which could account for my\ncompanion's evident excitement.\n\n\"There were one or two questions--\"\n\n\"Oh, I am weary of questions!\" cried Miss Cushing impatiently.\n\n\"You have two sisters, I believe.\"\n\n\"How could you know that?\"\n\n\"I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you have a\nportrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece, one of whom is\nundoubtedly yourself, while the others are so exceedingly like you that\nthere could be no doubt of the relationship.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are quite right.  Those are my sisters, Sarah and Mary.\"\n\n\"And here at my elbow is another portrait, taken at Liverpool, of your\nyounger sister, in the company of a man who appears to be a steward by\nhis uniform.  I observe that she was unmarried at the time.\"\n\n\"You are very quick at observing.\"\n\n\"That is my trade.\"\n\n\"Well, you are quite right.  But she was married to Mr. Browner a few\ndays afterwards.  He was on the South American line when that was\ntaken, but he was so fond of her that he couldn't abide to leave her\nfor so long, and he got into the Liverpool and London boats.\"\n\n\"Ah, the Conqueror, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No, the May Day, when last I heard.  Jim came down here to see me\nonce.  That was before he broke the pledge; but afterwards he would\nalways take drink when he was ashore, and a little drink would send him\nstark, staring mad.  Ah! it was a bad day that ever he took a glass in\nhis hand again.  First he dropped me, then he quarrelled with Sarah,\nand now that Mary has stopped writing we don't know how things are\ngoing with them.\"\n\nIt was evident that Miss Cushing had come upon a subject on which she\nfelt very deeply.  Like most people who lead a lonely life, she was shy\nat first, but ended by becoming extremely communicative.  She told us\nmany details about her brother-in-law the steward, and then wandering\noff on the subject of her former lodgers, the medical students, she\ngave us a long account of their delinquencies, with their names and\nthose of their hospitals.  Holmes listened attentively to everything,\nthrowing in a question from time to time.\n\n\"About your second sister, Sarah,\" said he.  \"I wonder, since you are\nboth maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.\"\n\n\"Ah! you don't know Sarah's temper or you would wonder no more. I tried\nit when I came to Croydon, and we kept on until about two months ago,\nwhen we had to part.  I don't want to say a word against my own sister,\nbut she was always meddlesome and hard to please, was Sarah.\"\n\n\"You say that she quarrelled with your Liverpool relations.\"\n\n\"Yes, and they were the best of friends at one time.  Why, she went up\nthere to live in order to be near them.  And now she has no word hard\nenough for Jim Browner.  The last six months that she was here she\nwould speak of nothing but his drinking and his ways.  He had caught\nher meddling, I suspect, and given her a bit of his mind, and that was\nthe start of it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Cushing,\" said Holmes, rising and bowing.  \"Your\nsister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street, Wallington?\nGood-bye, and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled over a\ncase with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to do.\"\n\nThere was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it.\n\n\"How far to Wallington?\" he asked.\n\n\"Only about a mile, sir.\"\n\n\"Very good.  Jump in, Watson.  We must strike while the iron is hot.\nSimple as the case is, there have been one or two very instructive\ndetails in connection with it.  Just pull up at a telegraph office as\nyou pass, cabby.\"\n\nHolmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay back in\nthe cab, with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the sun from his\nface. Our drive pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which\nwe had just quitted.  My companion ordered him to wait, and had his\nhand upon the knocker, when the door opened and a grave young gentleman\nin black, with a very shiny hat, appeared on the step.\n\n\"Is Miss Cushing at home?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,\" said he.  \"She has been\nsuffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity. As her\nmedical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility of allowing\nanyone to see her.  I should recommend you to call again in ten days.\"\nHe drew on his gloves, closed the door, and marched off down the street.\n\n\"Well, if we can't we can't,\" said Holmes, cheerfully.\n\n\"Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much.\"\n\n\"I did not wish her to tell me anything.  I only wanted to look at her.\nHowever, I think that I have got all that I want.  Drive us to some\ndecent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and afterwards we\nshall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the police-station.\"\n\nWe had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would talk\nabout nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation how he had\npurchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at least five hundred\nguineas, at a Jew broker's in Tottenham Court Road for fifty-five\nshillings.  This led him to Paganini, and we sat for an hour over a\nbottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote of that\nextraordinary man.  The afternoon was far advanced and the hot glare\nhad softened into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at the\npolice-station.  Lestrade was waiting for us at the door.\n\n\"A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,\" said he.\n\n\"Ha!  It is the answer!\"  He tore it open, glanced his eyes over it,\nand crumpled it into his pocket.  \"That's all right,\" said he.\n\n\"Have you found out anything?\"\n\n\"I have found out everything!\"\n\n\"What!\" Lestrade stared at him in amazement.  \"You are joking.\"\n\n\"I was never more serious in my life.  A shocking crime has been\ncommitted, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it.\"\n\n\"And the criminal?\"\n\nHolmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting cards\nand threw it over to Lestrade.\n\n\"That is the name,\" he said.  \"You cannot effect an arrest until\nto-morrow night at the earliest.  I should prefer that you do not\nmention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose to be\nonly associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in\ntheir solution.  Come on, Watson.\"  We strode off together to the\nstation, leaving Lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the\ncard which Holmes had thrown him.\n\n\n\"The case,\" said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over our cigars that\nnight in our rooms at Baker Street, \"is one where, as in the\ninvestigations which you have chronicled under the names of 'A Study in\nScarlet' and of 'The Sign of Four,' we have been compelled to reason\nbackward from effects to causes.  I have written to Lestrade asking him\nto supply us with the details which are now wanting, and which he will\nonly get after he had secured his man.  That he may be safely trusted\nto do, for although he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as\ntenacious as a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and\nindeed, it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top at\nScotland Yard.\"\n\n\"Your case is not complete, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is fairly complete in essentials.  We know who the author of the\nrevolting business is, although one of the victims still escapes us.\nOf course, you have formed your own conclusions.\"\n\n\"I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool boat, is\nthe man whom you suspect?\"\n\n\"Oh! it is more than a suspicion.\"\n\n\"And yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear.  Let me run\nover the principal steps.  We approached the case, you remember, with\nan absolutely blank mind, which is always an advantage.  We had formed\nno theories.  We were simply there to observe and to draw inferences\nfrom our observations.  What did we see first?  A very placid and\nrespectable lady, who seemed quite innocent of any secret, and a\nportrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters.  It\ninstantly flashed across my mind that the box might have been meant for\none of these.  I set the idea aside as one which could be disproved or\nconfirmed at our leisure.  Then we went to the garden, as you remember,\nand we saw the very singular contents of the little yellow box.\n\n\"The string was of the quality which is used by sail-makers aboard\nship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our\ninvestigation.  When I observed that the knot was one which is popular\nwith sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a port, and that the\nmale ear was pierced for an earring which is so much more common among\nsailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that all the actors in the\ntragedy were to be found among our seafaring classes.\n\n\"When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that it\nwas to Miss S. Cushing.  Now, the oldest sister would, of course, be\nMiss Cushing, and although her initial was 'S' it might belong to one\nof the others as well.  In that case we should have to commence our\ninvestigation from a fresh basis altogether.  I therefore went into the\nhouse with the intention of clearing up this point.  I was about to\nassure Miss Cushing that I was convinced that a mistake had been made\nwhen you may remember that I came suddenly to a stop.  The fact was\nthat I had just seen something which filled me with surprise and at the\nsame time narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.\n\n\"As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part of the\nbody which varies so much as the human ear.  Each ear is as a rule\nquite distinctive and differs from all other ones.  In last year's\nAnthropological Journal you will find two short monographs from my pen\nupon the subject.  I had, therefore, examined the ears in the box with\nthe eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their anatomical\npeculiarities.  Imagine my surprise, then, when on looking at Miss\nCushing I perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with the female\near which I had just inspected.  The matter was entirely beyond\ncoincidence.  There was the same shortening of the pinna, the same\nbroad curve of the upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner\ncartilage.  In all essentials it was the same ear.\n\n\"In the first place, her sister's name was Sarah, and her address had\nuntil recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious how the\nmistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant. Then we heard\nof this steward, married to the third sister, and learned that he had\nat one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah that she had actually gone\nup to Liverpool to be near the Browners, but a quarrel had afterwards\ndivided them.  This quarrel had put a stop to all communications for\nsome months, so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to\nMiss Sarah, he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address.\n\n\"And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out wonderfully.  We\nhad learned of the existence of this steward, an impulsive man, of\nstrong passions--you remember that he threw up what must have been a\nvery superior berth in order to be nearer to his wife--subject, too, to\noccasional fits of hard drinking. We had reason to believe that his\nwife had been murdered, and that a man--presumably a seafaring man--had\nbeen murdered at the same time.  Jealousy, of course, at once suggests\nitself as the motive for the crime.  And why should these proofs of the\ndeed be sent to Miss Sarah Cushing?  Probably because during her\nresidence in Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events\nwhich led to the tragedy.  You will observe that this line of boats\ncall at Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presuming that Browner\nhad committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his steamer, the\nMay Day, Belfast would be the first place at which he could post his\nterrible packet.\n\n\"A second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and although I\nthought it exceedingly unlikely, I was determined to elucidate it\nbefore going further.  An unsuccessful lover might have killed Mr. and\nMrs. Browner, and the male ear might have belonged to the husband.\nThere were many grave objections to this theory, but it was\nconceivable.  I therefore sent off a telegram to my friend Algar, of\nthe Liverpool force, and asked him to find out if Mrs. Browner were at\nhome, and if Browner had departed in the May Day.  Then we went on to\nWallington to visit Miss Sarah.\n\n\"I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear had\nbeen reproduced in her.  Then, of course, she might give us very\nimportant information, but I was not sanguine that she would.  She must\nhave heard of the business the day before, since all Croydon was\nringing with it, and she alone could have understood for whom the\npacket was meant.  If she had been willing to help justice she would\nprobably have communicated with the police already.  However, it was\nclearly our duty to see her, so we went.  We found that the news of the\narrival of the packet--for her illness dated from that time--had such\nan effect upon her as to bring on brain fever.  It was clearer than\never that she understood its full significance, but equally clear that\nwe should have to wait some time for any assistance from her.\n\n\"However, we were really independent of her help.  Our answers were\nwaiting for us at the police-station, where I had directed Algar to\nsend them.  Nothing could be more conclusive.  Mrs. Browner's house had\nbeen closed for more than three days, and the neighbours were of\nopinion that she had gone south to see her relatives.  It had been\nascertained at the shipping offices that Browner had left aboard of the\nMay Day, and I calculate that she is due in the Thames tomorrow night.\nWhen he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade, and\nI have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in.\"\n\nSherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations.  Two days\nlater he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short note from\nthe detective, and a typewritten document, which covered several pages\nof foolscap.\n\n\"Lestrade has got him all right,\" said Holmes, glancing up at me.\n\"Perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Holmes:\n\nIn accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to test our\ntheories\" [\"the 'we' is rather fine, Watson, is it not?\"] \"I went down\nto the Albert Dock yesterday at 6 p.m., and boarded the S.S. May Day,\nbelonging to the Liverpool, Dublin, and London Steam Packet Company.\nOn inquiry, I found that there was a steward on board of the name of\nJames Browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such an\nextraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to relieve him\nof his duties.  On descending to his berth, I found him seated upon a\nchest with his head sunk upon his hands, rocking himself to and fro.\nHe is a big, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy--something\nlike Aldrige, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair.  He jumped up\nwhen he heard my business, and I had my whistle to my lips to call a\ncouple of river police, who were round the corner, but he seemed to\nhave no heart in him, and he held out his hands quietly enough for the\ndarbies.  We brought him along to the cells, and his box as well, for\nwe thought there might be something incriminating; but, bar a big sharp\nknife such as most sailors have, we got nothing for our trouble.\nHowever, we find that we shall want no more evidence, for on being\nbrought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a\nstatement, which was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our\nshorthand man.  We had three copies typewritten, one of which I\nenclose.  The affair proves, as I always thought it would, to be an\nextremely simple one, but I am obliged to you for assisting me in my\ninvestigation.  With kind regards,\n\n\"Yours very truly,\n  \"G. Lestrade.\n\n\n\"Hum!  The investigation really was a very simple one,\" remarked\nHolmes, \"but I don't think it struck him in that light when he first\ncalled us in.  However, let us see what Jim Browner has to say for\nhimself.  This is his statement as made before Inspector Montgomery at\nthe Shadwell Police Station, and it has the advantage of being\nverbatim.\"\n\n\n\"'Have I anything to say?  Yes, I have a deal to say.  I have to make a\nclean breast of it all.  You can hang me, or you can leave me alone.  I\ndon't care a plug which you do.  I tell you I've not shut an eye in\nsleep since I did it, and I don't believe I ever will again until I get\npast all waking.  Sometimes it's his face, but most generally it's\nhers.  I'm never without one or the other before me.  He looks frowning\nand black-like, but she has a kind o' surprise upon her face.  Ay, the\nwhite lamb, she might well be surprised when she read death on a face\nthat had seldom looked anything but love upon her before.\n\n\"'But it was Sarah's fault, and may the curse of a broken man put a\nblight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins!  It's not that I\nwant to clear myself.  I know that I went back to drink, like the beast\nthat I was.  But she would have forgiven me; she would have stuck as\nclose to me as a rope to a block if that woman had never darkened our\ndoor.  For Sarah Cushing loved me--that's the root of the business--she\nloved me until all her love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that\nI thought more of my wife's footmark in the mud than I did of her whole\nbody and soul.\n\n\"'There were three sisters altogether.  The old one was just a good\nwoman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel. Sarah was\nthirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married. We were just as\nhappy as the day was long when we set up house together, and in all\nLiverpool there was no better woman than my Mary.  And then we asked\nSarah up for a week, and the week grew into a month, and one thing led\nto another, until she was just one of ourselves.\n\n\"'I was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little money\nby, and all was as bright as a new dollar.  My God, whoever would have\nthought that it could have come to this?  Whoever would have dreamed it?\n\n\"'I used to be home for the week-ends very often, and sometimes if the\nship were held back for cargo I would have a whole week at a time, and\nin this way I saw a deal of my sister-in-law, Sarah. She was a fine\ntall woman, black and quick and fierce, with a proud way of carrying\nher head, and a glint from her eye like a spark from a flint. But when\nlittle Mary was there I had never a thought of her, and that I swear as\nI hope for God's mercy.\n\n\"'It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me, or\nto coax me out for a walk with her, but I had never thought anything of\nthat.  But one evening my eyes were opened. I had come up from the ship\nand found my wife out, but Sarah at home.  \"Where's Mary?\" I asked.\n\"Oh, she has gone to pay some accounts.\"  I was impatient and paced up\nand down the room. \"Can't you be happy for five minutes without Mary,\nJim?\" says she.  \"It's a bad compliment to me that you can't be\ncontented with my society for so short a time.\"  \"That's all right, my\nlass,\" said I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she\nhad it in both hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in a\nfever.  I looked into her eyes and I read it all there.  There was no\nneed for her to speak, nor for me either.  I frowned and drew my hand\naway.  Then she stood by my side in silence for a bit, and then put up\nher hand and patted me on the shoulder.  \"Steady old Jim!\" said she,\nand with a kind o' mocking laugh, she ran out of the room.\n\n\"'Well, from that time Sarah hated me with her whole heart and soul,\nand she is a woman who can hate, too. I was a fool to let her go on\nbiding with us--a besotted fool--but I never said a word to Mary, for I\nknew it would grieve her.  Things went on much as before, but after a\ntime I began to find that there was a bit of a change in Mary herself.\nShe had always been so trusting and so innocent, but now she became\nqueer and suspicious, wanting to know where I had been and what I had\nbeen doing, and whom my letters were from, and what I had in my\npockets, and a thousand such follies.  Day by day she grew queerer and\nmore irritable, and we had ceaseless rows about nothing.  I was fairly\npuzzled by it all.  Sarah avoided me now, but she and Mary were just\ninseparable.  I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and\npoisoning my wife's mind against me, but I was such a blind beetle that\nI could not understand it at the time.  Then I broke my blue ribbon and\nbegan to drink again, but I think I should not have done it if Mary had\nbeen the same as ever. She had some reason to be disgusted with me now,\nand the gap between us began to be wider and wider.  And then this Alec\nFairbairn chipped in, and things became a thousand times blacker.\n\n\"'It was to see Sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it was\nto see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made friends\nwherever he went.  He was a dashing, swaggering chap, smart and curled,\nwho had seen half the world and could talk of what he had seen.  He was\ngood company, I won't deny it, and he had wonderful polite ways with\nhim for a sailor man, so that I think there must have been a time when\nhe knew more of the poop than the forecastle.  For a month he was in\nand out of my house, and never once did it cross my mind that harm\nmight come of his soft, tricky ways.  And then at last something made\nme suspect, and from that day my peace was gone forever.\n\n\"'It was only a little thing, too.  I had come into the parlour\nunexpected, and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of welcome on\nmy wife's face.  But as she saw who it was it faded again, and she\nturned away with a look of disappointment.  That was enough for me.\nThere was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken\nfor mine.  If I could have seen him then I should have killed him, for\nI have always been like a madman when my temper gets loose.  Mary saw\nthe devil's light in my eyes, and she ran forward with her hands on my\nsleeve. \"Don't, Jim, don't!\" says she.  \"Where's Sarah?\" I asked.  \"In\nthe kitchen,\" says she.  \"Sarah,\" says I as I went in, \"this man\nFairbairn is never to darken my door again.\"  \"Why not?\" says she.\n\"Because I order it.\"  \"Oh!\" says she, \"if my friends are not good\nenough for this house, then I am not good enough for it either.\"  \"You\ncan do what you like,\" says I, \"but if Fairbairn shows his face here\nagain I'll send you one of his ears for a keepsake.\"  She was\nfrightened by my face, I think, for she never answered a word, and the\nsame evening she left my house.\n\n\"'Well, I don't know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of\nthis woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me against my\nwife by encouraging her to misbehave.  Anyway, she took a house just\ntwo streets off and let lodgings to sailors. Fairbairn used to stay\nthere, and Mary would go round to have tea with her sister and him.\nHow often she went I don't know, but I followed her one day, and as I\nbroke in at the door Fairbairn got away over the back garden wall, like\nthe cowardly skunk that he was.  I swore to my wife that I would kill\nher if I found her in his company again, and I led her back with me,\nsobbing and trembling, and as white as a piece of paper.  There was no\ntrace of love between us any longer.  I could see that she hated me and\nfeared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she\ndespised me as well.\n\n\"'Well, Sarah found that she could not make a living in Liverpool, so\nshe went back, as I understand, to live with her sister in Croydon, and\nthings jogged on much the same as ever at home.  And then came this\nweek and all the misery and ruin.\n\n\"'It was in this way.  We had gone on the May Day for a round voyage of\nseven days, but a hogshead got loose and started one of our plates, so\nthat we had to put back into port for twelve hours.  I left the ship\nand came home, thinking what a surprise it would be for my wife, and\nhoping that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon.  The thought was\nin my head as I turned into my own street, and at that moment a cab\npassed me, and there she was, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two\nchatting and laughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching\nthem from the footpath.\n\n\"'I tell you, and I give you my word for it, that from that moment I\nwas not my own master, and it is all like a dim dream when I look back\non it.  I had been drinking hard of late, and the two things together\nfairly turned my brain.  There's something throbbing in my head now,\nlike a docker's hammer, but that morning I seemed to have all Niagara\nwhizzing and buzzing in my ears.\n\n\"'Well, I took to my heels, and I ran after the cab.  I had a heavy oak\nstick in my hand, and I tell you I saw red from the first; but as I ran\nI got cunning, too, and hung back a little to see them without being\nseen.  They pulled up soon at the railway station.  There was a good\ncrowd round the booking-office, so I got quite close to them without\nbeing seen.  They took tickets for New Brighton.  So did I, but I got\nin three carriages behind them.  When we reached it they walked along\nthe Parade, and I was never more than a hundred yards from them.  At\nlast I saw them hire a boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot\nday, and they thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water.\n\n\"'It was just as if they had been given into my hands.  There was a bit\nof a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred yards.  I\nhired a boat for myself, and I pulled after them.  I could see the blur\nof their craft, but they were going nearly as fast as I, and they must\nhave been a long mile from the shore before I caught them up.  The haze\nwas like a curtain all round us, and there were we three in the middle\nof it.  My God, shall I ever forget their faces when they saw who was\nin the boat that was closing in upon them?  She screamed out.  He swore\nlike a madman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death\nin my eyes.  I got past it and got one in with my stick that crushed\nhis head like an egg.  I would have spared her, perhaps, for all my\nmadness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out to him, and\ncalling him \"Alec.\"  I struck again, and she lay stretched beside him.\nI was like a wild beast then that had tasted blood.  If Sarah had been\nthere, by the Lord, she should have joined them.  I pulled out my\nknife, and--well, there! I've said enough.  It gave me a kind of savage\njoy when I thought how Sarah would feel when she had such signs as\nthese of what her meddling had brought about.  Then I tied the bodies\ninto the boat, stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk.  I knew\nvery well that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings\nin the haze, and had drifted off out to sea.  I cleaned myself up, got\nback to land, and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of\nwhat had passed.  That night I made up the packet for Sarah Cushing,\nand next day I sent it from Belfast.\n\n\"'There you have the whole truth of it.  You can hang me, or do what\nyou like with me, but you cannot punish me as I have been punished\nalready.  I cannot shut my eyes but I see those two faces staring at\nme--staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze.\nI killed them quick, but they are killing me slow; and if I have\nanother night of it I shall be either mad or dead before morning.  You\nwon't put me alone into a cell, sir?  For pity's sake don't, and may\nyou be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now.'\n\n\n\"What is the meaning of it, Watson?\" said Holmes solemnly as he laid\ndown the paper.  \"What object is served by this circle of misery and\nviolence and fear?  It must tend to some end, or else our universe is\nruled by chance, which is unthinkable.  But what end?  There is the\ngreat standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from\nan answer as ever.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventure of the Cardboard Box, by\nArthur Conan Doyle\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2344.txt or 2344.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/3\/4\/2344\/\n\nProduced by David Brannan.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":644,"split":"train"}
