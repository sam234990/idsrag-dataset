Reading the newspaper, they become aware of a young woman seeking a place as a \"paying guest\", or lodger. To supplement their income they respond to the advertisement and meet the prospective tenant, named Louise Derrick, who is in need of a place to live due to disagreements with her immediate family. Louise, who is poorly educated and bad-tempered, is being romantically pursued by two men: Mr Bowling, who is courting Louise's stepsister Cecily, and Tom Cobb.\nThe Mumfords do not get on well with their \"paying guest\", and attempt to persuade her to leave. This does not happen, and a series of events further disrupts the Mumfords' lives, including a private meeting between Louise and Clarence Mumford, which makes Clarence's wife jealous. Louise briefly and half heartedly seems to encourage Bowling's wooing of her, now that his courtship of Cecily is over, but Cobb makes a surprise trip to the Mumfords' home to pursue Louise. Louise, tripping on a chair Cobb had knocked over during the confrontation, accidentally starts a fire in the drawing room of the property, injuring Louise, who is then confined to bed for several weeks.\nEventually, Louise's time as the Mumfords' \"paying guest\" comes to an end, and she marries Cobb.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Paying Guest, by George Gissing\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Have we been extrav--'\n\n'No, no! Nothing of the kind. It just occurred to me that some such\narrangement might be pleasant for you. You must feel lonely, now and\nthen, during the day, and as we have plenty of room--'\n\nEmmeline took the matter seriously, but, being a young woman of some\ndiscretion, did not voice all her thoughts. The rent was heavy: so\nwas the cost of Clarence's season-ticket. Against this they had set\nthe advantage of the fine air of Sutton, so good for the child and\nfor the mother, both vastly better in health since they quitted\nLondon. Moreover, the remoteness of their friends favoured economy;\nthey could easily decline invitations, and need not often issue\nthem. They had a valid excuse for avoiding public entertainments--an\nexpense so often imposed by mere fashion. The house was roomy, the\ngarden delightful. Clarence, good fellow, might be sincere in his\nwish for her to have companionship; at the same time, this\nadvertisement had probably appealed to him in another way.\n\n'A YOUNG LADY desires to find a home with respectable,\nwell-connected family, in a suburb of London, or not more than 15\nmiles from Charing Cross. Can give excellent references. Terms not\nso much a consideration as comfort and pleasant society. No\nboarding-house.--Address: Louise, Messrs. Higgins & Co., Fenchurch\nSt., E.C.'\n\nShe read it again and again.\n\n'It wouldn't be nice if people said that we were taking lodgers.'\n\n'No fear of that. This is evidently some well-to-do person. It's a\nvery common arrangement nowadays, you know; they are called \"paying\nguests.\" Of course I shouldn't dream of having anyone you didn't\nthoroughly like the look of.'\n\n'Do you think,' asked Emmeline doubtfully, 'that we should quite\n_do_? \"Well-connected family\"--'\n\n'My dear girl! Surely we have nothing to be ashamed of?'\n\n'Of course not, Clarence. But--and \"pleasant society.\" What about\nthat?'\n\n'Your society is pleasant enough, I hope,' answered Mumford,\ngracefully. 'And the Fentimans--'\n\nThis was the only family with whom they were intimate at Sutton.\nNice people; a trifle sober, perhaps, and not in conspicuously\nflourishing circumstances; but perfectly presentable.\n\n'I'm afraid--' murmured Emmeline, and stopped short. 'As you say,'\nshe added presently, 'this is someone very well off. \"Terms not so\nmuch a consideration\"--'\n\n'Well, I tell you what--there can be no harm in dropping a note. The\nkind of note that commits one to nothing, you know. Shall I write\nit, or will you?'\n\nThey concocted it together, and the rough draft was copied by\nEmmeline. She wrote a very pretty hand, and had no difficulty\nwhatever about punctuation. A careful letter, calculated for the eye\nof refinement; it supplied only the indispensable details of the\nwriter's position, and left terms for future adjustment.\n\n'It's so easy to explain to people,' said Mumford, with an air of\nsatisfaction, when he came back from the post, 'that you wanted a\ncompanion. As I'm quite sure you do. A friend coming to stay with\nyou for a time--that's how I should put it.'\n\nA week passed, and there came no reply. Mumford pretended not to\ncare much, but Emmeline imagined a new anxiety in his look.\n\n'Do be frank with me, dear,' she urged one evening. 'Are we living\ntoo--'\n\nHe answered her with entire truthfulness. Ground for serious\nuneasiness there was none whatever; he could more than make ends\nmeet, and had every reason to hope it would always be so; but it\nwould relieve his mind if the end of the year saw a rather larger\nsurplus. He was now five-and-thirty--getting on in life. A man ought\nto make provision beyond the mere life-assurance--and so on.\n\n'Shall I look out for other advertisements?' asked Emmeline.\n\n'Oh, dear, no! It was just that particular one that caught my eye.'\n\nNext morning arrived a letter, signed 'Louise E. Derrick.' The\nwriter said she had been waiting to compare and think over some two\nhundred answers to her advertisement. 'It's really too absurd. How\ncan I remember them all? But I liked yours as soon as I read it, and\nI am writing to you first of all. Will you let me come and see you?\nI can tell you about myself much better than writing. Would tomorrow\ndo, in the afternoon? Please telegraph yes or no to Coburg Lodge,\nEmilia Road, Tulse Hill.'\n\nTo think over this letter Mumford missed his ordinary train. It was\nnot exactly the kind of letter he had expected, and Emmeline shared\nhis doubts. The handwriting seemed just passable; there was no\northographic error; but--refinement? This young person wrote, too,\nwith such singular nonchalance. And she said absolutely nothing\nabout her domestic circumstances. Coburg Lodge, Tulse Hill. A decent\nenough locality, doubtless; but--\n\n'There's no harm in seeing her,' said Emmeline at length. 'Send a\ntelegram, Clarence. Do you know, I think she _may_ be the right kind\nof girl. I was thinking of someone awfully grand, and it's rather a\nrelief. After all, you see, you--you are in business--'\n\n'To be sure. And this girl seems to belong to a business family. I\nonly wish she wrote in a more ladylike way.'\n\nEmmeline set her house in order, filled the drawing-room with\nflowers, made the spare bedroom as inviting as possible, and, after\nluncheon, spent a good deal of time in adorning her person. She was\na slight, pretty woman of something less than thirty; with a good,\nbut pale, complexion, hair tending to auburn, sincere eyes. Her\nlittle vanities had no roots of ill-nature; she could admire without\nenvy, and loved an orderly domestic life. Her husband's desire to\nincrease his income had rather unsettled her; she exaggerated the\nimportance of to-day's interview, and resolved with nervous energy\nto bring it to a successful issue, if Miss Derrick should prove a\npossible companion.\n\nAbout four o'clock sounded the visitor's ring. From her bedroom\nwindow Emmeline had seen Miss Derrick's approach. As the distance\nfrom the station was only five minutes' walk, the stranger naturally\ncame on foot. A dark girl, and of tolerably good features; rather\ndressy; with a carriage corresponding to the tone of her letter--an\neasy swing; head well up and shoulders squared. 'Oh, how I _hope_\nshe isn't vulgar!' said Emmeline to herself. 'I don't like the\nhat--I don't. And that sunshade with the immense handle.' From the\ntop of the stairs she heard a clear, unaffected voice: 'Mrs. Mumford\nat home?' Yes, the aspirate _was_ sounded--thank goodness!\n\nIt surprised her, on entering the room, to find that Miss Derrick\nlooked no less nervous than she was herself. The girl's cheeks were\nflushed, and she half choked over her 'How do you do?'\n\n'I hope you had no difficulty in finding the house. I would have met\nyou at the station if you had mentioned the train. Oh, but--how\nsilly!--I shouldn't have known you.'\n\nMiss Derrick laughed, and seemed of a sudden much more at ease.\n\n'Oh, I like you for that!' she exclaimed mirthfully. 'It's just the\nkind of thing I say myself sometimes. And I'm so glad to see that\nyou are--you mustn't be offended--I mean you're not the kind of\nperson to be afraid of.'\n\nThey laughed together. Emmeline could not subdue her delight when\nshe found that the girl really might be accepted as a lady. There\nwere faults of costume undeniably; money had been misspent in\nseveral directions; but no glaring vulgarity hurt the eye. And her\nspeech, though not strictly speaking refined, was free from the\nfaults that betray low origin. Then, she seemed good-natured though\nthere was something about her mouth not altogether charming.\n\n'Do you know Sutton at all?' Emmeline inquired.\n\n'Never was here before. But I like the look of it. I like this\nhouse, too. I suppose you know a lot of people here, Mrs. Mumford?'\n\n'Well--no. There's only one family we know at all well. Our friends\nlive in London. Of course they often come out here. I don't know\nwhether you are acquainted with any of them. The Kirby Simpsons, of\nWest Kensington; and Mrs. Hollings, of Highgate--'\n\nMiss Derrick cast down her eyes and seemed to reflect. Then she\nspoke abruptly.\n\n'I don't know any people to speak of. I ought to tell you that my\nmother has come down with me. She's waiting at the station till I go\nback; then she'll come and see you. You're surprised? Well, I had\nbetter tell you that I'm leaving home because I can't get on with my\npeople. Mother and I have always quarrelled, but it has been worse\nthan ever lately. I must explain that she has married a second time,\nand Mr. Higgins--I'm glad to say that isn't _my_ name--has a\ndaughter of his own by a first marriage; and we can't bear each\nother--Miss Higgins, I mean. Some day, if I come to live here, I\ndaresay I shall tell you more. Mr. Higgins is rich, and I can't say\nhe's unkind to me; he'll give me as much as I want; but I'm sure\nhe'll be very glad to get me out of the house. I have no money of my\nown--worse luck! Well, we thought it best for me to come alone,\nfirst, and see--just to see, you know--whether we were likely to\nsuit each other. Then mother will come and tell you all she has to\nsay about me. Of course I know what it'll be. They all say I've a\nhorrible temper. I don't think so myself; and I'm sure I don't think\nI should quarrel with _you_, you look so nice. But I can't get on at\nhome, and it's better for all that we should part. I'm just\ntwo-and-twenty--do I look older? I haven't learnt to do anything,\nand I suppose I shall never need to.'\n\n'Do you wish to see _much_ society?' inquired Mrs. Mumford, who was\nthinking rapidly, 'or should you prefer a few really nice people?\nI'm afraid I don't quite understand yet whether you want society of\nthe pleasure-seeking kind, or--'\n\nShe left the alternative vague. Miss Derrick again reflected for a\nmoment before abruptly declaring herself.\n\n'I feel sure that your friends are the kind I want to know. At all\nevents, I should like to try. The great thing is to get away from\nhome and see how things look.'\n\nThey laughed together. Emmeline, after a little more talk, offered\nto take her visitor over the house, and Miss Derrick had loud praise\nfor everything she saw.\n\n'What I like about you,' she exclaimed of a sudden, as they stood\nlooking from a bedroom window on to the garden, 'is that you don't\nput on any--you know what I mean. People seem to me to be generally\neither low and ignorant, or so high and mighty there's no getting on\nwith them at all. You're just what I wanted to find. Now I must go\nand send mother to see you.'\n\nEmmeline protested against this awkward proceeding. Why should not\nboth come together and have a cup of tea? If it were desired, Miss\nDerrick could step into the garden whilst her mother said whatever\nshe wished to say. The girl assented, and in excellent spirits\nbetook herself to the railway station. Emmeline waited something\nless than a quarter of an hour; then a hansom drove up, and Mrs.\nHiggins, after a deliberate surveyal of the house front, followed\nher daughter up the pathway.\n\nThe first sight of the portly lady made the situation clearer to\nMrs. Mumford. Louise Derrick represented a certain stage of\ncivilisation, a degree of conscious striving for better things; Mrs.\nHiggins was prosperous and self-satisfied vulgarity. Of a complexion\nmuch lighter than the girl's, she still possessed a coarse\ncomeliness, which pointed back to the dairymaid type of damsel. Her\nfeatures revealed at the same time a kindly nature and an irascible\ntendency. Monstrously overdressed, and weighted with costly gewgaws,\nshe came forward panting and perspiring, and, before paying any heed\nto her hostess, closely surveyed the room.\n\n'Mrs. Mumford,' said the girl, 'this is my mother. Mother, this is\nMrs. Mumford. And now, please, let me go somewhere while you have\nyour talk.'\n\n'Yes, that'll be best, that'll be best,' exclaimed Mrs. Higgins.\n'Dear, 'ow 'ot it is! Run out into the garden, Louise. Nice little\n'ouse, Mrs. Mumford. And Louise seems quite taken with you. She\ndoesn't take to people very easy, either. Of course, you can give\nsatisfactory references? I like to do things in a business-like way.\nI understand your 'usband is in the City; shouldn't wonder if he\nknows some of Mr. 'Iggins's friends. Yes, I will take a cup, if you\nplease. I've just had one at the station, but it's such thirsty\nweather. And what do you think of Louise? Because I'd very much\nrather you said plainly if you don't think you could get on.'\n\n'But, indeed, I fancy we could, Mrs. Higgins.'\n\n'Well, I'm sure I'm very glad _of_ it. It isn't everybody can get on\nwith Louise. I dessay she's told you a good deal about me and her\nstepfather. I don't think she's any reason to complain of the\ntreatment--'\n\n'She said you were both very kind to her,' interposed the hostess.\n\n'I'm sure we _try_ to be, and Mr. 'Iggins, he doesn't mind what he\ngives her. A five-pound note, if you'll believe me, is no more than\na sixpence to him when he gives her presents. You see, Mrs.\nRumford--no, Mumford, isn't it?--I was first married very\nyoung--scarcely eighteen, I was; and Mr. Derrick died on our\nwedding-day, two years after. Then came Mr. 'Iggins. Of course I\nwaited a proper time. And one thing I can say, that no woman was\never 'appier with two 'usbands than I've been. I've two sons growing\nup, hearty boys as ever you saw. If it wasn't for this trouble with\nLouise--' She stopped to wipe her face. 'I dessay she's told you\nthat Mr. 'Iggins, who was a widower when I met him, has a daughter\nof his first marriage--her poor mother died at the birth, and she's\nolder than Louise. I don't mind telling _you_, Mrs. Mumford, she's\nclose upon six-and-twenty, and nothing like so good-looking as\nLouise, neither. Mr. 'Iggins, he's kindness itself; but when it\ncomes to differences between his daughter and _my_ daughter, well,\nit isn't in nature he shouldn't favour his own. There's more be'ind,\nbut I dessay you can guess, and I won't trouble you with things that\ndon't concern you. And that's how it stands, you see.'\n\nBy a rapid calculation Emmeline discovered; with surprise, that Mrs.\nHiggins could not be much more than forty years of age. It must have\nbeen a life of gross self-indulgence that had made the woman look at\nleast ten years older. This very undesirable parentage naturally\naffected Emmeline's opinion of Louise, whose faults began to show in\na more pronounced light. One thing was clear: but for the fact that\nLouise aimed at a separation from her relatives, it would be barely\npossible to think of receiving her. If Mrs. Higgins thought of\ncoming down to Sutton at unexpected moments--no, that was too\ndreadful.\n\n'Should you wish, Mrs. Higgins, to entrust your daughter to me\nentirely?'\n\n'My dear Mrs. Rumford, it's very little that _my_ wishes has to do\nwith it! She's made up her mind to leave 'ome, and all I can do is\nto see she gets with respectable people, which I feel sure you are;\nand of course I shall have your references.'\n\nEmmeline turned pale at the suggestion. She all but decided that the\nmatter must go no further.\n\n'And what might your terms be--inclusive?' Mrs. Higgins proceeded to\ninquire.\n\nAt this moment a servant entered with tea, and Emmeline, sorely\nflurried, talked rapidly of the advantages of Sutton as a residence.\nShe did not allow her visitor to put in a word till the door closed\nagain. Then, with an air of decision, she announced her terms; they\nwould be three guineas a week. It was half a guinea more than she\nand Clarence had decided to ask. She expected, she hoped, Mrs.\nHiggins would look grave. But nothing of the kind; Louise's mother\nseemed to think the suggestion very reasonable. Thereupon Emmeline\nadded that, of course, the young lady would discharge her own\nlaundress's bill. To this also Mrs. Higgins readily assented.\n\n'A hundred and sixty pounds per annum!' Emmeline kept repeating to\nherself. And, alas! it looked as if she might have asked much more.\nThe reference difficulty might be minimised by naming her own\nmarried sister, who lived at Blackheath, and Clarence's most\nintimate friend, Mr. Tarling, who held a good position in a City\nhouse, and had a most respectable address at West Kensington. But\nher heart misgave her. She dreaded her husband's return home.\n\nThe conversation was prolonged for half-an-hour. Emmeline gave her\nreferences, and in return requested the like from Mrs. Higgins. This\nastonished the good woman. Why, her husband was Messrs. 'Iggins of\nFenchurch Street! Oh, a mere formality, Emmeline hastened to\nadd--for Mr. Mumford's satisfaction. So Mrs. Higgins very pompously\nnamed two City firms, and negotiations, for the present, were at an\nend.\n\nLouise, summoned to the drawing-room, looked rather tired of\nwaiting.\n\n'When can you have me, Mrs. Mumford?' she asked. 'I've quite made up\nmy mind to come.'\n\n'I'm afraid a day or two must pass, Miss Derrick--'\n\n'The references, my dear,' began Mrs. Higgins.\n\n'Oh, nonsense! It's all right; anyone can see.'\n\n'There you go! Always cutting short the words in my mouth. I can't\nendure such behaviour, and I wonder what Mrs. Rumford thinks of it.\nI've given Mrs. Rumford fair warning--'\n\nThey wrangled for a few minutes, Emmeline feeling too depressed and\nanxious to interpose with polite commonplaces. When at length they\ntook their leave, she saw the last of them with a sigh of\nthanksgiving. It had happened most fortunately that no one called\nthis afternoon.\n\n'Clarence, it's _quite_ out of the question.' Thus she greeted her\nhusband. 'The girl herself I could endure, but oh, her odious\nmother!--Three guineas a week! I could cry over the thought.'\n\nBy the first post in the morning came a letter from Louise. She\nwrote appealingly, touchingly. 'I know you couldn't stand my mother,\nbut do please have me. I like Sutton, and I like your house, and I\nlike you. I promise faithfully nobody from home shall ever come to\nsee me, so don't be afraid. Of course if you won't have me, somebody\nelse will; I've got two hundred to choose from, but I'd rather come\nto you. Do write and say I may come. I'm so sorry I quarrelled with\nmother before you. I promise never to quarrel with you. I'm very\ngood-tempered when I get what I want.' With much more to the same\neffect.\n\n'We _will_ have her,' declared Mumford. 'Why not, if the old people\nkeep away?--You are quite sure she sounds her _h's_?'\n\n'Oh, quite. She has been to pretty good schools, I think. And I dare\nsay I could persuade her to get other dresses and hats.'\n\n'Of course you could. Really, it seems almost a duty to take\nher--doesn't it?'\n\nSo the matter was settled, and Mumford ran off gaily to catch his\ntrain.\n\nThree days later Miss Derrick arrived, bringing with her something\nlike half-a-ton of luggage. She bounded up the doorsteps, and,\nmeeting Mrs. Mumford in the hall, kissed her fervently.\n\n'I've got such heaps to tell you Mr. Higgins has given me twenty\npounds to go on with--for myself; I mean; of course he'll pay\neverything else. How delighted I am to be here! Please pay the\ncabman I've got no change.'\n\nA few hours before this there had come a letter from Mrs. Higgins;\nbetter written and spelt than would have seemed likely.\n\n'Dear Mrs. Mumford,' it ran, 'L. is coming to-morrow morning, and I\nhope you won't repent. There's just one thing I meant to have said\nto you but forgot, so I'll say it now. If it should happen that any\ngentleman of your acquaintance takes a fancy to L., and if it should\ncome to anything, I'm sure both Mr. H. and me would be _most\nthankful_, and Mr. H. would behave handsome to her. And what's more,\nI'm sure he would be only too glad to show _in a handsome way_ the\nthanks he would owe to you and Mr. M.--Very truly yours, Susan H.\nHiggins.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\n'Runnymede' (so the Mumfords' house was named) stood on its own\nlittle plot of ground in one of the tree-shadowed roads which\npersuade the inhabitants of Sutton that they live in the country. It\nwas of red brick, and double-fronted, with a porch of wood and\nstucco; bay windows on one side of the entrance, and flat on the\nother, made a contrast pleasing to the suburban eye. The little\nfront garden had a close fence of unpainted lath, a characteristic\nof the neighbourhood. At the back of the house lay a long, narrow\nlawn, bordered with flower-beds, and shaded at the far end by a fine\nhorse-chestnut.\n\nEmmeline talked much of the delightful proximity of the Downs; one\nwould have imagined her taking long walks over the breezy uplands to\nBanstead or Epsom, or yet further afield The fact was, she saw no\nmore of the country than if she had lived at Brixton. Her windows\nlooked only upon the surrounding houses and their garden foliage.\nOccasionally she walked along the asphalte pavement of the Brighton\nRoad--a nursemaids' promenade--as far as the stone which marks\ntwelve miles from Westminster Bridge. Here, indeed, she breathed the\nair of the hills, but villas on either hand obstructed the view, and\nbrought London much nearer than the measured distance. Like her\nfriends and neighbours, Emmeline enjoyed Sutton because it was a\nmost respectable little portion of the great town, set in a purer\natmosphere. The country would have depressed her.\n\nIn this respect Miss Derrick proved a congenial companion. Louise\nmade no pretence of rural inclinations, but had a great liking for\ntree-shadowed asphalte, for the results of elaborate horticulture,\nfor the repose and the quiet of villadom.\n\n'I should like to have a house just like this,' she declared, on her\nfirst evening at \"Runnymede,\" talking with her host and hostess out\nin the garden. 'It's quite big enough, unless, of course, you have a\nvery large family, which must be rather a bore.' She laughed\ningenuously. 'And one gets to town so easily. What do you pay for\nyour season-ticket, Mr. Mumford? Oh, well! that isn't much. I almost\nthink I shall get one.'\n\n'Do you wish to go up very often, then?' asked Emmeline, reflecting\non her new responsibilities.\n\n'Oh! not every day, of course. But a season-ticket saves the bother\neach time, and you have a sort of feeling, you know, that you can be\nin town whenever you like.'\n\nIt had not hitherto been the Mumfords' wont to dress for dinner, but\nthis evening they did so, and obviously to Miss Derrick's\ngratification. She herself appeared in a dress which altogether\noutshone that of her hostess. Afterwards, in private, she drew\nEmmeline's attention to this garb, and frankly asked her opinion of\nit.\n\n'Very nice indeed,' murmured the married lady, with a good-natured\nsmile. 'Perhaps a little--'\n\n'There, I know what you're going to say. You think it's too showy.\nNow I want you to tell me just what you think about\neverything--everything. I shan't be offended. I'm not so silly. You\nknow I've come here to learn all sorts of things. To-morrow you\nshall go over all my dresses with me, and those you don't like I'll\nget rid of. I've never had anyone to tell me what's nice and what\nisn't. I want to be--oh, well, you know what I mean.'\n\n'But, my dear,' said Emmeline, 'there's something I don't quite\nunderstand. You say I'm to speak plainly, and so I will. How is it\nthat you haven't made friends long ago with the sort of people you\nwish to know? It isn't as if you were in poor circumstances.'\n\n'How _could_ I make friends with nice people when I was ashamed to\nhave them at home? The best I know are quite poor--girls I went to\nschool with. They're much better educated than I am, but they make\ntheir own living, and so I can't see very much of them, and I'm not\nsure they want to see much of _me_. I wish I knew what people think\nof me; they call me vulgar, I believe--the kind I'm speaking of.\nNow, do tell me, Mrs. Mumford, _am_ I vulgar?'\n\n'My dear Miss Derrick--' Emmeline began in protest, but was at once\ninterrupted.\n\n'Oh! that isn't what I want. You must call me Louise, or Lou, if you\nlike, and just say what you really think. Yes, I see, I _am_ rather\nvulgar, and what can you expect? Look at mother; and if you saw Mr.\nHiggins, oh! The mistake I made was to leave school so soon. I got\nsick of it, and left at sixteen, and of course the idiots at home--I\nmean the foolish people--let me have my own way. I'm not clever, you\nknow, and I didn't get on well at school. They used to say I could\ndo much better if I liked, and perhaps it was more laziness than\nstupidity, though I don't care for books--I wish I did. I've had\nlots of friends, but I never keep them for very long. I don't know\nwhether it's their fault or mine. My oldest friends are Amy Barker\nand Muriel Featherstone; they were both at the school at Clapham,\nand now Amy does type-writing in the City, and Muriel is at a\nphotographer's. They're awfully nice girls, and I like them so much;\nbut then, you see, they haven't enough money to live in what _I_\ncall a nice way, and, you know, I should never think of asking them\nto advise me about my dresses, or anything of that kind. A friend of\nmine once began to say something and I didn't like it; after that we\nhad nothing to do with each other.'\n\nEmmeline could not hide her amusement.\n\n'Well, that's just it,' went on the other frankly. 'I _have_ rather\na sharp temper, and I suppose I don't get on well with most people.\nI used to quarrel dreadfully with some of the girls at school--the\nuppish sort. And yet all the time I wanted to be friends with them.\nBut, of course, I could never have taken them home.'\n\nMrs. Mumford began to read the girl's character, and to understand\nhow its complexity had shaped her life. She was still uneasy as to\nthe impression this guest would make upon their friends, but on the\nwhole it seemed probable that Louise would conscientiously submit\nherself to instruction, and do her very best to be \"nice.\"\nClarence's opinion was still favourable; he pronounced Miss Derrick\n\"very amusing,\" and less of a savage than his wife's description had\nled him to expect.\n\nHaving the assistance of two servants and a nurse-girl, Emmeline was\nnot overburdened with domestic work. She soon found it fortunate\nthat her child, a girl of two years old, needed no great share of\nher attention; for Miss Derrick, though at first she affected an\nextravagant interest in the baby, very soon had enough of that\nplaything, and showed a decided preference for Emmeline's society\nout of sight and hearing of nursery affairs. On the afternoon of the\nsecond day they went together to call upon Mrs. Fentiman, who lived\nat a distance of a quarter of an hour's walk, in a house called\n\"Hazeldene\"; a semi-detached house, considerably smaller than\n\"Runnymede,\" and neither without nor within so pleasant to look\nupon. Mrs. Fentiman, a tall, hard-featured, but amiable lady, had\ntwo young children who occupied most of her time; at present one of\nthem was ailing, and the mother could talk of nothing else but this\ndistressing circumstance. The call lasted only for ten minutes, and\nEmmeline felt that her companion was disappointed.\n\n'Children are a great trouble,' Louise remarked, when they had left\nthe house. 'People ought never to marry unless they can keep a lot\nof servants. Not long ago I was rather fond of somebody, but I\nwouldn't have him because he had no money. Don't you think I was\nquite right?'\n\n'I have no doubt you were.'\n\n'And now,' pursued the girl, poking the ground with her sunshade as\nshe walked, 'there's somebody else. And that's one of the things I\nwant to tell you about. He has about three hundred a year. It isn't\nmuch, of course; but I suppose Mr. Higgins would give me something.\nAnd yet I'm sure it won't come to anything. Let's go home and have a\ngood talk, shall we?'\n\nMrs. Higgins's letter had caused Emmeline and her husband no little\namusement; but at the same time it led them to reflect. Certainly\nthey numbered among their acquaintances one or two marriageable\nyoung men who might perchance be attracted by Miss Derrick,\nespecially if they learnt that Mr. Higgins was disposed to 'behave\nhandsomely' to his stepdaughter; but the Mumfords had no desire to\nsee Louise speedily married. To the bribe with which the letter\nended they could give no serious thought. Having secured their\n\"paying guest,\" they hoped she would remain with them for a year or\ntwo at least. But already Louise had dropped hints such as Emmeline\ncould not fail to understand, and her avowal of serious interest in\na lover came rather as an annoyance than a surprise to Mrs. Mumford.\n\nIt was a hot afternoon, and they had tea brought out into the\ngarden, under the rustling leaves of the chestnut.\n\n'You don't know anyone else at Sutton except Mrs. Fentiman?' said\nLouise, as she leaned back in the wicker chair.\n\n'Not intimately. But some of our friends from London will be coming\non Sunday. I've asked four people to lunch.'\n\n'How jolly! Of course you'll tell me all about them before then. But\nI want to talk about Mr. Cobb. Please, _two_ lumps of sugar. I've\nknown him for about a year and a half. We seem quite old friends,\nand he writes to me; I don't answer the letters, unless there's\nsomething to say. To tell the truth, I don't like him.'\n\n'How can that be if you seem old friends?'\n\n'Well, he likes _me_; and there's no harm in that, so long as he\nunderstands. I'm sure _you_ wouldn't like him. He's a rough, coarse\nsort of man, and has a dreadful temper.'\n\n'Good gracious! What is his position?'\n\n'Oh, he's connected with the what-d'ye-call-it Electric Lighting\nCompany. He travels about a good deal. I shouldn't mind that; it\nmust be rather nice not to have one's husband always at home. Just\nnow I believe he's in Ireland. I shall be having a letter from him\nvery soon, no doubt. He doesn't know I've left home, and it'll make\nhim wild. Yes, that's the kind of man he is. Fearfully jealous, and\nsuch a temper! If I married him, I'm quite sure he would beat me\nsome day.'\n\n'Oh!' Emmeline exclaimed. 'How can you have anything to do with such\na man?'\n\n'He's very nice sometimes,' answered Louise, thoughtfully.\n\n'But do you really mean that he is \"rough and coarse\"?'\n\n'Yes, I do. You couldn't call him a gentleman. I've never seen his\npeople; they live somewhere a long way off; and I shouldn't wonder\nif they are a horrid lot. His last letter was quite insulting. He\nsaid--let me see, what was it? Yes--\"You have neither heart nor\nbrains, and I shall do my best not to waste another thought on you?\"\nWhat do you think of that?'\n\n'It seems very extraordinary, my dear. How can he write to you in\nthat way if you never gave him any encouragement?'\n\n'Well, but I suppose I have done. We've met on the Common now and\nthen, and--and that kind of thing. I'm afraid you're shocked, Mrs.\nMumford. I know it isn't the way that nice people behave, and I'm\ngoing to give it up.'\n\n'Does your mother know him?'\n\n'Oh, yes! there's no secret about it. Mother rather likes him. Of\ncourse he behaves himself when he's at the house. I've a good mind\nto ask him to call here so that you could see him. Yes, I should\nlike you to see him. You wouldn't mind?'\n\n'Not if you really wish it, Louise. But--I can't help thinking you\nexaggerate his faults.'\n\n'Not a bit. He's a regular brute when he gets angry.'\n\n'My dear,' Emmeline interposed softly, 'that isn't quite a ladylike\nexpression.'\n\n'No, it isn't. Thank you, Mrs. Mumford. I meant to say he is\nhorrid--very disagreeable. Then there's something else I want to tell you\nabout. Cissy Higgins--that's Mr. Higgins's daughter, you know--is\nhalf engaged to a man called Bowling--an awful idiot--'\n\n'I don't think I would use that word, dear.'\n\n'Thank you, Mrs. Mumford. I mean to say he's a regular silly. But\nhe's in a very good position--a partner in Jannaway Brothers of\nWoolwich, though he isn't thirty yet. Well, now, what do you think?\nMr. Bowling doesn't seem to know his own mind, and just lately he's\nbeen paying so much attention to _me_ that Cissy has got quite\nfrantic about it. This was really and truly the reason why I left\nhome.'\n\n'I see,' murmured the listener, with a look of genuine interest.\n\n'Yes. They wanted to get me out of the way. There wasn't the\nslightest fear that I should try to cut Cissy Higgins out; but it\nwas getting very awkward for her, I admit. Now that's the kind of\nthing that doesn't go on among nice people, isn't it?'\n\n'But what do you mean, Louise, when you say that Miss Higgins and\nMr.--Mr. Bowling are _half_ engaged?'\n\n'Oh, I mean she has refused him once, just for form's sake; but he\nknows very well she means to have him. People of your kind don't do\nthat sort of thing, do they?'\n\n'I hardly know,' Emmeline replied, colouring a little at certain\nprivate reminiscences. 'And am I to understand that you wouldn't on\nany account listen to Mr. Bowling?'\n\nLouise laughed.\n\n'Oh, there's no knowing what I might do to spite Cissy. We hate each\nother, of course. But I can't fancy myself marrying him, He has a\nlong nose, and talks through it. And he says \"think you\" for \"thank\nyou,\" and he sings--oh, to hear him sing! I can't bear the man.'\n\nThe matter of this conversation Emmeline reported to her husband at\nnight, and they agreed in the hope that neither Mr. Cobb nor Mr.\nBowling would make an appearance at \"Runnymede.\" Mumford opined that\nthese individuals were \"cads.\" Small wonder, he said, that the girl\nwished to enter a new social sphere. His wife, on the other hand,\nhad a suspicion that Miss Derrick would not be content to see the\nlast of Mr. Cobb. He, the electrical engineer, or whatever he was,\ncould hardly be such a ruffian as the girl depicted. His words, 'You\nhave neither heart nor brains,' seemed to indicate anything but a\ncoarse mind.\n\n'But what a bad-tempered lot they are!' Mumford observed. 'I suppose\npeople of that sort quarrel and abuse each other merely to pass the\ntime. They seem to be just one degree above the roughs who come to\nblows and get into the police court. You must really do your best to\nget the girl out of it; I'm sure she is worthy of better things.'\n\n'She is--in one way,' answered his wife judicially. 'But her\neducation stopped too soon. I doubt if it's possible to change her\nvery much. And--I really should like, after all, to see Mr. Cobb.'\n\nMumford broke into a laugh.\n\n'There you go! The eternal feminine. You'll have her married in six\nmonths.'\n\n'Don't be vulgar, Clarence. And we've talked enough of Louise for\nthe present.'\n\nMiss Derrick's presentiment that a letter from Mr. Cobb would soon\nreach her was justified the next day; it arrived in the afternoon,\nreaddressed from Tulse Hill. Emmeline observed the eagerness with\nwhich this epistle was pounced upon and carried off for private\nperusal. She saw, too, that in half-an-hour's time Louise left the\nhouse--doubtless to post a reply. But, to her surprise, not a word\nof the matter escaped Miss Derrick during the whole evening.\n\nIn her school-days, Louise had learned to \"play the piano,\" but,\ncaring little or nothing for music, she had hardly touched a key for\nseveral years. Now the idea possessed her that she must resume her\npractising, and to-day she had spent hours at the piano, with\npainful effect upon Mrs. Mumford's nerves. After dinner she offered\nto play to Mumford, and he, good-natured fellow, stood by her to\nturn over the leaves. Emmeline, with fancy work in her hands,\nwatched the two. She was not one of the most foolish of her sex, but\nit relieved her when Clarence moved away.\n\nThe next morning Louise was an hour late for breakfast. She came\ndown when Mumford had left the house, and Emmeline saw with surprise\nthat she was dressed for going out.\n\n'Just a cup of coffee, please. I've no appetite this morning, and I\nwant to catch a train for Victoria as soon as possible.'\n\n'When will you be back?'\n\n'Oh, I don't quite know. To tea, I think.'\n\nThe girl had all at once grown reticent, and her lips showed the\nless amiable possibilities of their contour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nAt dinner-time she had not returned. It being Saturday, Mumford was\nback early in the afternoon, and Miss Derrick's absence caused no\ngrief. Emmeline could play with baby in the garden, whilst her\nhusband smoked his pipe and looked on in the old comfortable way.\nThey already felt that domestic life was not quite the same with a\nstranger to share it. Doubtless they would get used to the new\nrestraints; but Miss Derrick must not expect them to disorganise\ntheir mealtimes on her account. Promptly at half-past seven they sat\ndown to dine, and had just risen from the table, when Louise\nappeared.\n\nShe was in excellent spirits, without a trace of the morning's\nill-humour. No apologies! If she didn't feel quite free to come and\ngo, without putting people out, there would be no comfort in life. A\nslice of the joint, that was all she wanted, and she would have done\nin a few minutes.\n\n'I've taken tickets for Toole's Theatre on Monday night. You must\nboth come. You can, can't you?'\n\nMumford and his wife glanced at each other. Yes, they could go; it\nwas very kind of Miss Derrick; but--\n\n'That's all right, it'll be jolly. The idea struck me in the train,\nas I was going up; so I took a cab from Victoria and booked the\nplaces first thing. Third row from the front, dress circle; the best\nI could do. Please let me have my dinner alone. Mrs. Mumford, I want\nto tell you something afterwards.'\n\nClarence went round to see his friend Fentiman, with whom he usually\nhad a chat on Saturday evening. Emmeline was soon joined by the\nguest in the drawing-room.\n\n'There, you may read that,' said Louise, holding out a letter. 'It's\nfrom Mr. Cobb; came yesterday, but I didn't care to talk about it\nthen. Yes, please read it; I want you to.'\n\nReluctantly, but with curiosity, Emmeline glanced over the sheet.\nMr. Cobb wrote in ignorance of Miss Derrick's having left home. It\nwas a plain, formal letter, giving a brief account of his doings in\nIreland, and making a request that Louise would meet him, if\npossible, on Streatham Common, at three o'clock on Saturday\nafternoon. And he signed himself--'Very sincerely yours.'\n\n'I made up my mind at once,' said the girl, 'that I wouldn't meet\nhim. That kind of thing will have to stop. I'm not going to think\nany more of him, and it's better to make him understand it at\nonce--isn't it?'\n\nEmmeline heartily concurred.\n\n'Still,' pursued the other, with an air of great satisfaction, 'I\nthought I had better go home for this afternoon. Because when he\ndidn't see me on the Common he was pretty sure to call at the house,\nand I didn't want mother or Cissy to be talking about me to him\nbefore he had heard my own explanation.'\n\n'Didn't you answer the letter?' asked Emmeline.\n\n'No. I just sent a line to mother, to let her know I was coming over\nto-day, so that she might stay at home. Well, and it happened just\nas I thought. Mr. Cobb came to the house at half-past three. But\nbefore that I'd had a terrible row with Cissy. That isn't a nice\nexpression, I know, but it really was one of our worst quarrels. Mr.\nBowling hasn't been near since I left, and Cissy is furious. She\nsaid such things that I had to tell her very plainly what I thought\nof her; and she positively foamed at the mouth! \"Now look here,\" she\nsaid, \"if I find out that he goes to Sutton, you'll see what will\nhappen.\" \"_What_ will happen?\" I asked. \"Father will stop your\nallowance, and you'll have to get on as best you can.\" \"Oh, very\nwell,\" I said, \"in that case I shall marry Mr. Bowling.\" You should\nhave seen her rage! \"You said you wouldn't marry him if he had ten\nthousand a year!\" she screamed. \"I dare say I did; but if I've\nnothing to live upon--\" \"You can marry your Mr. Cobb, can't you?\"\nAnd she almost cried; and I should have felt sorry for her if she\nhadn't made me so angry. \"No,\" I said, \"I can't marry Mr. Cobb. And\nI never dreamt of marrying Mr. Cobb. And--\"'\n\nEmmeline interposed.\n\n'Really, Louise, that kind of talk isn't at all ladylike. What a\npity you went home.'\n\n'Yes, I was sorry for it afterwards. I shan't go again for a long\ntime; I promise you I won't. However, Mr. Cobb came, and I saw him\nalone. He was astonished when he heard what had been going on; he\nwas astonished at _me_, too--I mean, the way I spoke. I wanted him\nto understand at once that there was nothing between us; I talked in\nrather a--you know the sort of way.' She raised her chin slightly,\nand looked down from under her eyelids. 'Oh, I assure you I behaved\nquite nicely. But he got into a rage, as he always does, and began\nto call me names, and I wouldn't stand it. \"Mr. Cobb,\" I said, very\nseverely, \"either you will conduct yourself properly, or you will\nleave the house.\" Then he tried another tone, and said very\ndifferent things--the kind of thing one likes to hear, you know; but\nI pretended that I didn't care for it a bit. \"It's all over between\nus then?\" he shouted at last; yes, really shouted, and I'm sure\npeople must have heard. \"All over?\" I said. \"But there never _was_\nanything--nothing serious.\" \"Oh, all right. Good-bye, then.\" And off\nhe rushed. And I dare say I've seen the last of him--for a time.'\n\n'Now do try to live quietly, my dear,' said Emmeline. 'Go on with\nyour music, and read a little each day--'\n\n'Yes, that's just what I'm going to do, dear Mrs. Mumford. And your\nfriends will be here to-morrow; it'll be so quiet and nice. And on\nMonday we shall go to the theatre, just for a change. And I'm not\ngoing to think of those people. It's all settled. I shall live very\nquietly indeed.'\n\nShe banged on the piano till nearly eleven o'clock, and went off to\nbed with a smile of virtuous contentment.\n\nThe guests who arrived on Sunday morning were Mr. and Mrs. Grove,\nMr. Bilton, and Mr. Dunnill. Mrs. Grove was Emmeline's elder sister,\na merry, talkative, kindly woman. Aware of the circumstances, she at\nonce made friends with Miss Derrick, and greatly pleased that young\nlady by a skilful blending of \"superior\" talk with easy homeliness.\nMr. Bilton, a stockbroker's clerk, represented the better kind of\nCity young man--athletic, yet intelligent, spirited without\nvulgarity a breezy, good-humoured, wholesome fellow. He came down on\nhis bicycle, and would return in the same way. Louise at once made a\nresolve to learn cycling.\n\n'I wish you lived at Sutton, Mr. Bilton. I should ask you to teach\nme.'\n\n'I'm really very sorry that I don't,' replied the young man\ndiscreetly.\n\n'Oh, never mind. I'll find somebody.'\n\nThe fourth arrival, Mr. Dunnill, was older and less affable. He\ntalked chiefly with Mr. Grove, a very quiet, somewhat careworn man;\nneither of them seemed able to shake off business, but they did not\nobtrude it on the company in general. The day passed pleasantly, but\nin Miss Derrick's opinion, rather soberly. Doing her best to\nfascinate Mr. Bilton, she felt a slight disappointment at her\ninability to engross his attention, and at the civil friendliness\nwhich he thought a sufficient reply to her gay sallies. For so\ngood-looking and well-dressed a man he struck her as singularly\nreserved. But perhaps he was \"engaged\"; yes, that must be the\nexplanation. When the guests had left, she put a plain question to\nMrs. Mumford.\n\n'I don't _think_ he is engaged,' answered Emmeline, who on the whole\nwas satisfied with Miss Derrick's demeanour throughout the day.\n\n'Oh! But, of course, he _may_ be, without you knowing it. Or is it\nalways made known?'\n\n'There's no rule about it, my dear.'\n\n'Well, they're very nice people,' said Louise, with a little sigh.\n'And I like your sister so much. I'm glad she asked me to go and see\nher. Is Mr. Bilton often at her house?--Don't misunderstand me, Mrs.\nMumford. It's only that I _do_ like men's society; there's no harm,\nis there? And people like Mr. Bilton are very different from those\nI've known; and I want to see more of them, you know.'\n\n'There's no harm in saying that to _me_, Louise,' replied Mrs.\nMumford. 'But pray be careful not to seem \"forward.\" People\nthink--and say--such disagreeable things.'\n\nMiss Derrick was grateful, and again gave an assurance that repose\nand modesty should be the rule of her life.\n\nAt the theatre on Monday evening she exhibited a childlike enjoyment\nwhich her companions could not but envy. The freshness of her\nsensibilities was indeed remarkable, and Emmeline observed with\npleasure that her mind seemed to have a very wholesome tone. Louise\nmight commit follies, and be guilty of bad taste to any extent, but\nnothing in her savoured of depravity.\n\nTuesday she spent at home, pretending to read a little, and\nobviously thinking a great deal. On Wednesday morning she proposed\nof a sudden that Emmeline should go up to town with her on a\nshopping expedition. They had already turned over her wardrobe,\nnumerous articles whereof were condemned by Mrs. Mumford's taste,\nand by Louise cheerfully sacrificed; she could not rest till new\npurchases had been made. So, after early luncheon, they took train\nto Victoria, Louise insisting that all the expenses should be hers.\nBy five o'clock she had laid out some fifteen pounds, vastly to her\nsatisfaction. They took tea at a restaurant, and reached Sutton not\nlong before Mumford's return.\n\nOn Friday they went to London again, to call upon Mrs. Grove. Louise\npromised that this should be her last \"outing\" for a whole week. She\nadmitted a feeling of restlessness, but after to-day she would\novercome it. And that night she apologised formally to Mumford for\ntaking his wife so much from home.\n\n'Please don't think I shall always be running about like this. I\nfeel that I'm settling down. We are going to be very comfortable and\nquiet.'\n\nAnd, to the surprise of her friends, more than a week went by before\nshe declared that a day in town was absolutely necessary. Mr.\nHiggins had sent her a fresh supply of money, as there were still a\nfew things she needed to purchase. But this time Emmeline begged her\nto go alone, and Louise seemed quite satisfied with the arrangement.\n\nEarly in the afternoon, as Mrs. Mumford was making ready to go out,\nthe servant announced to her that a gentleman had called to see Miss\nDerrick; on learning that Miss Derrick was away, he had asked sundry\nquestions, and ended by requesting an interview with Mrs. Mumford.\nHis name was Cobb.\n\n'Show him into the drawing-room,' said Emmeline, a trifle agitated.\n'I will be down in a few moments.'\n\nBeset by anxious anticipations, she entered the room, and saw before\nher a figure not wholly unlike what she had imagined: a wiry,\nresolute-looking man, with knitted brows, lips close-set, and heavy\nfeet firmly planted on the carpet. He was respectably dressed, but\nnothing more, and in his large bare hands held a brown hat marked\nwith a grease spot. One would have judged him a skilled mechanic.\nWhen he began to speak, his blunt but civil phrases were in keeping\nwith this impression. He had not the tone of an educated man, yet\ncommitted no vulgar errors.\n\n'My name is Cobb. I must beg your pardon for troubling you. Perhaps\nyou have heard of me from Miss Derrick?'\n\n'Yes, Mr. Cobb, your name has been mentioned,' Emmeline replied\nnervously. 'Will you sit down?'\n\n'Thank you, I will.'\n\nHe twisted his hat about, and seemed to prepare with difficulty the\nnext remark, which at length burst, rather than fell, from his lips.\n\n'I wanted to see Miss Derrick. I suppose she is still living with\nyou? They told me so.'\n\nA terrible man, thought Emmeline, when roused to anger; his words\nmust descend like sledge-hammers. And it would not take much to\nanger him. For all that, he had by no means a truculent countenance.\nHe was trying to smile, and his features softened agreeably enough.\nThe more closely she observed him, the less grew Emmeline's wonder\nthat Louise felt an interest in the man.\n\n'Miss Derrick is likely to stay with us for some time, I believe.\nShe has only gone to town, to do some shopping.'\n\n'I see. When I met her last she talked a good deal about you, Mrs.\nMumford, and that's why I thought I would ask to see you. You have a\ngood deal of influence over her.'\n\n'Do you think so?' returned Emmeline, not displeased. 'I hope I may\nuse it for her good.'\n\n'So do I. But--well, it comes to this, Mrs. Mumford. She seemed to\nhint--though she didn't exactly say so--that you were advising her\nto have nothing more to do with me. Of course you don't know me, and\nI've no doubt you do what you think the best for her. I should feel\nit a kindness if you would just tell me whether you are really\npersuading her to think no more about me.'\n\nIt was an alarming challenge. Emmeline's fears returned; she half\nexpected an outbreak of violence. The man was growing very nervous,\nand his muscles showed the working of strong emotion.\n\n'I have given her no such advice, Mr. Cobb,' she answered, with an\nattempt at calm dignity. 'Miss Derrick's private affairs don't at\nall concern me. In such matters as this she is really quite old\nenough to judge for herself.'\n\n'That's what _I_ should have said,' remarked Mr. Cobb sturdily. 'I\nhope you'll excuse me; I don't wish to make myself offensive. After\nwhat she said to me when we met last, I suppose most men would just\nlet her go her own way. But--but somehow I can't do that. The thing\nis, I can't trust what she says; I don't believe she knows her own\nmind. And so long as you tell me that you're not interfering--I\nmean, that you don't think it right to set her against me--'\n\n'I assure you, nothing of the kind.'\n\nThere was a brief silence, then Cobb's voice again sounded with\nblunt emphasis.\n\n'We're neither of us very good-tempered. We've known each other\nabout a year, and we must have quarrelled about fifty times.'\n\n'Do you think, then,' ventured the hostess, 'that it would ever be\npossible for you to live peacefully together?'\n\n'Yes, I do,' was the robust answer. 'It would be a fight for the\nupper hand, but I know who'd get it, and after that things would be\nall right.'\n\nEmmeline could not restrain a laugh, and her visitor joined in it\nwith a heartiness which spoke in his favour.\n\n'I promise you, Mr. Cobb, that I will do nothing whatever against\nyour interests.'\n\n'That's very kind of you, and it's all I wanted to know.'\n\nHe stood up. Emmeline, still doubtful how to behave, asked him if he\nwould call on another day, when Miss Derrick might be at home.\n\n'It's only by chance I was able to get here this afternoon,' he\nreplied. 'I haven't much time to go running about after her, and\nthat's where I'm at a disadvantage. I don't know whether there's\nanyone else, and I'm not asking you to tell me, if you know. Of\ncourse I have to take my chance; but so long as you don't speak\nagainst me--and she thinks a great deal of your advice--'\n\n'I'm very glad to be assured of that. All I shall do, Mr. Cobb, is\nto keep before her mind the duty of behaving straightforwardly.'\n\n'That's the thing! Nobody can ask more than that.'\n\nEmmeline hesitated, but could not dismiss him without shaking hands.\nThat he did not offer to do so until invited, though he betrayed no\nsense of social inferiority, seemed another point in his favour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nNot half an hour after Cobb's departure Louise returned. Emmeline\nwas surprised to see her back so soon; they met near the railway\nstation as Mrs. Mumford was on her way to a shop in High Street.\n\n'Isn't it good of me! If I had stayed longer I should have gone home\nto quarrel with Cissy; but I struggled against the temptation. Going\nto the grocer's? Oh, do let me go with you, and see how you do that\nkind of thing. I never gave an order at the grocer's in my life--no,\nindeed I never did. Mother and Cissy have always looked after\nthat. And I want to learn about housekeeping; you promised to teach\nme.'\n\nEmmeline made no mention of Mr. Cobb's call until they reached the\nhouse.\n\n'He came here!' Louise exclaimed, reddening. 'What impudence! I\nshall at once write and tell him that his behaviour is outrageous.\nAm I to be hunted like this?'\n\nHer wrath seemed genuine enough; but she was vehemently eager to\nlearn all that had passed. Emmeline made a truthful report.\n\n'You're quite sure that was all? Oh, his impertinence! Well, and now\nthat you've seen him, don't you understand how--how impossible it\nis?'\n\n'I shall say nothing more about it, Louise. It isn't my business\nto--'\n\nThe girl's face threatened a tempest. As Emmeline was moving away,\nshe rudely obstructed her.\n\n'I insist on you telling me what you think. It was abominable of him\nto come when I wasn't at home; and I don't think you ought to have\nseen him. You've no right to keep your thoughts to yourself!'\n\nMrs. Mumford was offended, and showed it.\n\n'I have a perfect right, and I shall do so. Please don't let us\nquarrel. You may be fond of it, but I am not.'\n\nLouise went from the room and remained invisible till just before\ndinner, when she came down with a grave and rather haughty\ncountenance. To Mumford's remarks she replied with curt formality;\nhe, prepared for this state of things, began conversing cheerfully\nwith his wife, and Miss Derrick kept silence. After dinner, she\npassed out into the garden.\n\n'It won't do,' said Mumford. 'The house is upset. I'm afraid we\nshall have to get rid of her.'\n\n'If she can't behave herself, I'm afraid we must. It's my fault. I\nought to have known that it would never do.'\n\nAt half-past ten, Louise was still sitting out of doors in the dark.\nEmmeline, wishing to lock up for the night, went to summon her\ntroublesome guest.\n\n'Hadn't you better come in?'\n\n'Yes. But I think you are very unkind, Mrs. Mumford.'\n\n'Miss Derrick, I really can't do anything but leave you alone when\nyou are in such an unpleasant hum our.'\n\n'But that's just what you _oughtn't_ to do. When I'm left alone I\nsulk, and that's bad for all of us. If you would just get angry and\ngive me what I deserve, it would be all over very soon.'\n\n'You are always talking about \"nice\" people. Nice people don't have\nscenes of that kind.'\n\n'No, I suppose not. And I'm very sorry, and if you'll let me beg\nyour pardon--. There, and we might have made it up hours ago. I\nwon't ask you to tell me what you think of Mr. Cobb. I've written\nhim the kind of letter his impudence deserves.'\n\n'Very well. We won't talk of it any more. And if you _could_ be a\nlittle quieter in your manners, Louise--'\n\n'I will, I promise I will! Let me say good-night to Mr. Mumford.'\n\nFor a day or two there was halcyon weather. On Saturday afternoon\nLouise hired a carriage and took her friends for a drive into the\ncountry; at her special request the child accompanied them. Nothing\ncould have been more delightful. She had quite made up her mind to\nhave a house, some day, at Sutton. She hoped the Mumfords would\n\"always\" live there, that they might perpetually enjoy each other's\nsociety. What were the rents? she inquired. Well, to begin with, she\nwould be content with one of the smaller houses; a modest,\nsemidetached little place, like those at the far end of Cedar Road.\nThey were perfectly respectable--were they not? How this change in\nher station was to come about Louise offered no hint, and did not\nseem to think of the matter.\n\nThen restlessness again came upon her. One day she all but declared\nher disappointment that the Mumfords saw so few people. Emmeline,\nrepeating this to her husband, avowed a certain compunction.\n\n'I almost feel that I deliberately misled her. You know, Clarence,\nin our first conversation I mentioned the Kirby Simpsons and Mrs.\nHollings, and I feel sure she remembers. It wouldn't be nice to be\ntaking her money on false pretences, would it?'\n\n'Oh, don't trouble. It's quite certain she has someone in mind whom\nshe means to marry before long.'\n\n'I can't help thinking that. But I don't know who it can be. She had\na letter this morning in a man's writing, and didn't speak of it. It\nwasn't Mr. Cobb.'\n\nLouise, next day, put a point-blank question.\n\n'Didn't you say that you knew some people at West Kensington?'\n\n'Oh, yes,' answered Emmeline, carelessly. 'The Kirby Simpsons.\nThey're away from home.'\n\n'I'm sorry for that. Isn't there anyone else we could go and see, or\nask over here?'\n\n'I think it very likely Mr. Bilton will come down in a few days.'\n\nLouise received Mr. Bilton's name with moderate interest. But she\ndropped the subject, and seemed to reconcile herself to domestic\npleasures.\n\nIt was on the evening of this day that Emmeline received a letter\nwhich gave her much annoyance. Her sister, Mrs. Grove, wrote thus:\n\n'How news does get about! And what ridiculous forms it takes! Here\nis Mrs. Powell writing to me from Birmingham, and she says she has\nheard that you have taken in the daughter of some wealthy _parvenu_,\nfor a consideration, to train her in the ways of decent society!\nJust the kind of thing Mrs. Powell would delight in talking about--she\nis so very malicious. Where she got her information I can't\nimagine. She doesn't give the slightest hint. \"They tell me\"--I copy\nher words--\"that the girl is all but a savage, and does and says the\nmost awful things. I quite admire Mrs. Mumford's courage. I've heard\nof people doing this kind of thing, and I always wondered how they\ngot on with their friends.\" Of course I have written to contradict\nthis rubbish. But it's very annoying, I'm sure.'\n\nMumford was angry. The source of these fables must be either Bilton\nor Dunnill, yet he had not thought either of them the kind of men to\nmake mischief. Who else knew anything of the affair? Searching her\nmemory, Emmeline recalled a person unknown to her, a married lady,\nwho had dropped in at Mrs. Grove's when she and Louise were there.\n\n'I didn't like her--a supercilious sort of person. And she talked a\ngreat deal of her acquaintance with important people. It's far more\nlikely to have come from her than from either of those men. I shall\nwrite and tell Molly so.'\n\nThey began to feel uncomfortable, and seriously thought of getting\nrid of the burden so imprudently undertaken. Louise, the next day,\nwanted to take Emmeline to town, and showed dissatisfaction when she\nhad to go unaccompanied. She stayed till late in the evening, and\ncame back with a gay account of her calls upon two or three old\nfriends--the girls of whom she had spoken to Mrs. Mumford. One of\nthem, Miss Featherstone, she had taken to dine with her at a\nrestaurant, and afterwards they had spent an hour or two at Miss\nFeatherstone's lodgings.\n\n'I didn't go near Tulse Hill, and if you knew how I am wondering\nwhat is going on there! Not a line from anyone. I shall write to\nmother to-morrow.'\n\nEmmeline produced a letter which had arrived for Miss Derrick.\n\n'Why didn't you give it me before?' Louise exclaimed, impatiently.\n\n'My dear, you had so much to tell me. I waited for the first pause.'\n\n'That isn't from home,' said the girl, after a glance at the\nenvelope. 'It's nothing.'\n\nAfter saying good-night, she called to Emmeline from her bedroom\ndoor. Entering the room, Mrs. Mumford saw the open letter in\nLouise's hand, and read in her face a desire of confession.\n\n'I want to tell you something. Don't be in a hurry; just a few\nminutes. This letter is from Mr. Bowling. Yes, and I've had one from\nhim before, and I was obliged to answer it.'\n\n'Do you mean they are love-letters?'\n\n'Yes, I'm afraid they are. And it's so stupid, and I'm so vexed. I\ndon't want to have anything to do with him, as I told you long ago.'\nLouise often used expressions which to a stranger would have implied\nthat her intimacy with Mrs. Mumford was of years' standing. 'He\nwrote for the first time last week. Such a silly letter! I wish you\nwould read it. Well, he said that it was all over between him and\nCissy, and that he cared only for me, and always had, and always\nwould--you know how men write. He said he considered himself quite\nfree. Cissy had refused him, and wasn't that enough? Now that I was\naway from home, he could write to me, and wouldn't I let him see me?\nOf course I wrote that I didn't _want_ to see him, and I thought he\nwas behaving very badly--though I don't really think so, because\nit's all that idiot Cissy's fault. Didn't I do quite right?'\n\n'I think so.'\n\n'Very well. And now he's writing again, you see; oh, such a lot of\nrubbish! I can hear him saying it all through his nose. Do tell me\nwhat I ought to do next.'\n\n'You must either pay no attention to the letter, or reply so that he\ncan't possibly misunderstand you.'\n\n'Call him names, you mean?'\n\n'My dear Louise!'\n\n'But that's the only way with such men. I suppose you never were\nbothered with them. I think I'd better not write at all.'\n\nEmmeline approved this course, and soon left Miss Derrick to her\nreflections.\n\nThe next day Louise carried out her resolve to write for information\nregarding the progress of things at Coburg Lodge. She had not long\nto wait for a reply, and it was of so startling a nature that she\nran at once to Mrs. Mumford, whom she found in the nursery.\n\n'Do please come down. Here's something I must tell you about. What\ndo you think mother says? I've to go back home again at once.'\n\n'What's the reason?' Emmeline inquired, knowing not whether to be\nglad or sorry.\n\n'I'll read it to you:--\"Dear Lou,\" she says, \"you've made a great\ndeal of trouble, and I hope you're satisfied. Things are all upside\ndown, and I've never seen dada\"--that's Mr. Higgins, of course--\"I've\nnever seen dada in such a bad temper, not since first I knew\nhim. Mr. B.\"--that's Mr. Bowling, you know--\"has told him plain that\nhe doesn't think any more of Cissy, and that nothing mustn't be\nexpected of him.\"--Oh what sweet letters mother does write!--\"That\nwas when dada went and asked him about his intentions, as he\ncouldn't help doing, because Cissy is fretting so. It's all over,\nand of course you're the cause of it; and, though I can't blame you\nas much as the others do, I think you _are_ to blame. And Cissy said\nshe must go to the seaside to get over it, and she went off\nyesterday to Margate to your Aunt Annie's boarding-house, and there\nshe says she shall stay as long as she doesn't feel quite well, and\ndada has to pay two guineas a week for her. So he says at once, 'Now\nLoo 'll have to come back. I'm not going to pay for the both of them\nboarding out,' he says. And he means it. He has told me to write to\nyou at once, and you're to come as soon as you can, and he won't be\nresponsible to Mrs. Mumford for more than another week's\npayment.\"--There! But I shan't go, for all that. The idea! I left\nhome just to please them, and now I'm to go back just when it suits\ntheir convenience. Certainly not.'\n\n'But what will you do, Louise,' asked Mrs. Mumford, 'if Mr. Higgins\nis quite determined?'\n\n'Do? Oh! I shall settle it easy enough. I shall write at once to the\nold man and tell him I'm getting on so nicely in every way that I\ncouldn't dream of leaving you. It's all nonsense, you'll see.'\n\nEmmeline and her husband held a council that night, and resolved\nthat, whatever the issue of Louise's appeal to her stepfather, this\nwas a very good opportunity for getting rid of their guest. They\nwould wait till Louise made known the upshot of her negotiations. It\nseemed probable that Mr. Higgins would spare them the unpleasantness\nof telling Miss Derrick she must leave. If not, that disagreeable\nnecessity must be faced.\n\n'I had rather cut down expenses all round,' said Emmeline, 'than\nhave our home upset in this way. It isn't like home at all. Louise\nis a whirlwind, and the longer she stays, the worse it'll be.'\n\n'Yes, it won't do at all,' Mumford assented. 'By the bye, I met\nBilton to-day, and he asked after Miss Derrick. I didn't like his\nlook or his tone at all. I feel quite sure there's a joke going\nround at our expense. Confound it!'\n\n'Never mind. It'll be over in a day or two, and it'll be a lesson to\nyou, Clarence, won't it?'\n\n'I quite admit that the idea was mine,' her husband replied, rather\nirritably. 'But it wasn't I who accepted the girl as a suitable\nperson.'\n\n'And certainly it wasn't _me_!' rejoined Emmeline. 'You will please\nto remember that I said again and again--'\n\n'Oh, hang it, Emmy! We made a blunder, both of us, and don't let us\nmake it worse by wrangling about it. There you are; people of that\nclass bring infection into the house. If she stayed here a\ntwelvemonth, we should have got to throwing things at each other.'\n\nThe answer to Louise's letter of remonstrance came in the form of\nMrs. Higgins herself. Shortly before luncheon that lady drove up to\n\"Runnymede\" in a cab, and her daughter, who had just returned from a\nwalk, was startled to hear of the arrival.\n\n'You've got to come home with me, Lou,' Mrs. Higgins began, as she\nwiped her perspiring face. 'I've promised to have you back by this\nafternoon. Dada's right down angry; you wouldn't know him. He blames\neverything on to you, and you'd better just come home quiet.'\n\n'I shall do nothing of the kind,' answered Louise, her temper\nrising.\n\nMrs. Higgins glared at her and began to rail; the voice was\npainfully audible to Emmeline, who just then passed through the\nhall. Miss Derrick gave as good as she received; a battle raged for\nsome minutes, differing from many a former conflict only in the\nmoderation of pitch and vocabulary due to their being in a\nstranger's house.\n\n'Then you won't come?' cried the mother at length. 'I've had my\njourney for nothing, have I? Then just go and fetch Mrs.\nWhat's-her-name. She must hear what I've got to say.'\n\n'Mrs. Mumford isn't at home,' answered Louise, with bold mendacity.\n'And a very good thing too. I should be sorry for her to see you in\nthe state you're in.'\n\n'I'm in no more of a state than you are, Louise! And just you listen\nto this. Not one farthing more will you have from 'ome--not one\nfarthing! And you may think yourself lucky if you still '_ave_ a\n'ome. For all I know, you'll have to earn your own living, and I'd\nlike to hear how you mean to do it. As soon as I get back I shall\nwrite to Mrs. What's-her-name and tell her that nothing will be paid\nfor you after the week that's due and the week that's for notice.\nNow just take heed of what you're doing, Lou. It may have more\nserious results than you think for.'\n\n'I've thought all I'm going to think,' replied the girl. 'I shall\nstay here as long as I like, and be indebted neither to you nor to\nstepfather.'\n\nMrs. Mumford breathed a sigh of thankfulness that she was not called\nupon to take part in this scene. It was bad enough that the servant\nengaged in laying lunch could hear distinctly Mrs. Higgins's coarse\nand violent onslaught. When the front door at length closed she\nrejoiced, but with trembling; for the words that fell upon her ear\nfrom the hall announced too plainly that Louise was determined to\nstay.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nMiss Derrick had gone back into the drawing-room, and, to Emmeline's\nsurprise, remained there. This retirement was ominous; the girl must\nbe taking some resolve. Emmeline, on her part, braced her courage\nfor the step on which she had decided. Luncheon awaited them, but it\nwould be much better to arrive at an understanding before they sat\ndown to the meal. She entered the room and found Louise leaning on\nthe back of a chair.\n\n'I dare say you heard the row,' Miss Derrick remarked coldly. 'I'm\nvery sorry, but nothing of that kind shall happen again.'\n\nHer countenance was disturbed, she seemed to be putting a restraint\nupon herself, and only with great effort to subdue her voice.\n\n'What are you going to do?' asked Emmeline, in a friendly tone, but,\nas it were, from a distance.\n\n'I am going to ask you to do me a great kindness, Mrs. Mumford.'\n\nThere was no reply. The girl paused a moment, then resumed\nimpulsively.\n\n'Mr. Higgins says that if I don't come home, he won't let me have\nany more money. They're going to write and tell you that they won't\nbe responsible after this for my board and lodging. Of course I\nshall not go home; I shouldn't dream of it; I'd rather earn my\nliving as--as a scullery maid. I want to ask you, Mrs. Mumford,\nwhether you will let me stay on, and trust me to pay what I owe you.\nIt won't be for very long, and I promise you I _will_ pay, every\npenny.'\n\nThe natural impulse of Emmeline's disposition was to reply with\nhospitable kindliness; she found it very difficult to maintain her\npurpose; it shamed her to behave like the ordinary landlady, to\nappear actuated by mean motives. But the domestic strain was growing\nintolerable, and she felt sure that Clarence would be exasperated if\nher weakness prolonged it.\n\n'Now do let me advise you, Louise,' she answered gently. 'Are you\nacting wisely? Wouldn't it be very much better to go home?',\n\nLouise lost all her self-control. Flushed with anger, her eyes\nglaring, she broke into vehement exclamations.\n\n'You want to get rid of me! Very well, I'll go this moment. I was\ngoing to tell you something; but you don't care what becomes of me.\nI'll send for my luggage; you shan't be troubled with it long. And\nyou'll be paid all that's owing. I didn't think you were one of that\nkind. I'll go this minute.'\n\n'Just as you please,' said Emmeline, 'Your temper is really so\nvery--'\n\n'Oh, I know. It's always my temper, and nobody else is ever to\nblame. I wouldn't stay another night in the house, if I had to sleep\non the Downs!'\n\nShe flung out of the room and flew upstairs. Emmeline, angered by\nthis unwarrantable treatment, determined to hold aloof, and let the\ngirl do as she would. Miss Derrick was of full age, and quite\ncapable of taking care of herself, or at all events ought to be.\nPerhaps this was the only possible issue of the difficulties in\nwhich they had all become involved; neither Louise nor her parents\ncould be dealt with in the rational, peaceful way preferred by\nwell-conditioned people. To get her out of the house was the main\npoint; if she chose to depart in a whirlwind, that was her own\naffair. All but certainly she would go home, to-morrow if not\nto-day.\n\nIn less than a quarter of an hour her step sounded on the\nstairs--would she turn into the dining-room, where Emmeline now sat\nat table? No; straight through the hall, and out at the front door,\nwhich closed, however, quite softly behind her. That she did not\nslam it seemed wonderful to Emmeline. The girl was not wholly a\nsavage.\n\nPresently Mrs. Mumford went up to inspect the forsaken chamber.\nLouise had packed all her things: of course she must have tumbled\nthem recklessly into the trunks. Drawers were left open, as if to\nexhibit their emptiness, but in other respects the room looked tidy\nenough. Neatness and order came by no means naturally to Miss\nDerrick, and Emmeline did not know what pains the girl had taken,\never since her arrival, to live in conformity with the habits of a\n'nice' household.\n\nLouise, meanwhile, had gone to the railway station, intending to\ntake a ticket for Victoria. But half an hour must elapse before the\narrival of a train, and she walked about in an irresolute mood. For\none thing, she felt hungry; at Sutton her appetite had been keen,\nand meal-times were always welcome. She entered the refreshment\nroom, and with inward murmurs made a repast which reminded her of\nthe excellent luncheon she might now have been enjoying. All the\ntime, she pondered her situation. Ultimately, instead of booking for\nVictoria, she procured a ticket for Epsom Downs, and had not long to\nwait for the train.\n\nIt was a hot day at the end of June. Wafts of breezy coolness passed\nnow and then over the high open country, but did not suffice to\ncombat the sun's steady glare. After walking half a mile or so,\nabsorbed in thought, Louise suffered so much that she looked about\nfor shadow. Before her was the towering ugliness of the Grand Stand;\nthis she had seen and admired when driving past it with her friends;\nit did not now attract her. In another direction the Downs were\nedged with trees, and that way she turned. All but overcome with\nheat and weariness, she at length found a shaded spot where her\nsolitude seemed secure. And, after seating herself, the first thing\nshe did was to have a good cry.\n\nThen for an hour she sat thinking, and as she thought her face\ngradually emerged from gloom--the better, truer face which so often\nallowed itself to be disguised at the prompting of an evil spirit;\nher softening lips all but smiled, as if at an amusing suggestion,\nand her eyes, in their reverie, seemed to behold a pleasant promise.\nUnconsciously she plucked and tasted the sweet stems of grass that\ngrew about her. At length, the sun's movements having robbed her of\nshadow, she rose, looked at her watch, and glanced around for\nanother retreat. Hard by was a little wood, delightfully grassy and\ncool, fenced about with railings she could easily have climbed; but\na notice-board, severely admonishing trespassers, forbade the\nattempt. With a petulant remark to herself on the selfishness of\n\"those people,\" she sauntered past.\n\nAlong this edge of the Downs stands a picturesque row of pine-trees,\nstunted, bittered, and twisted through many a winter by the upland\ngales. Louise noticed them, only to think for a moment what ugly\ntrees they were. Before her, east, west, and north, lay the wooded\nlandscape, soft of hue beneath the summer sky, spreading its\ntranquil beauty far away to the mists of the horizon. In vivacious\ncompany she would have called it, and perhaps have thought it, a\ncharming view; alone, she had no eye for such things--an\nindifference characteristic of her mind, and not at all dependent\nupon its mood. Presently another patch of shade invited her to\nrepose again, and again she meditated for an hour or more.\n\nThe sun had grown less ardent, and a breeze, no longer fitful, made\nwalking pleasant. The sight of holiday-making school-children, who,\nin their ribboned hats and white pinafores, were having tea not far\naway, suggested to Louise that she also would like such refreshment.\nDoubtless it might be procured at the inn yonder, near the\nracecourse, and thither she began to move. Her thoughts were more at\nrest; she had made her plan for the evening; all that had to be done\nwas to kill time for another hour or so. Walking lightly over the\nturf, she noticed the chalk marks significant of golf, and wondered\nhow the game was played. Without difficulty she obtained her cup of\ntea, loitered over it as long as possible, strayed yet awhile about\nthe Downs, and towards half-past six made for the railway station.\n\nShe travelled no further than Sutton, and there lingered in the\nwaiting room till the arrival of a certain train from London Bridge.\nAs the train came in she took up a position near the exit. Among the\npeople who had alighted, her eye soon perceived Clarence Mumford.\nShe stepped up to him and drew his attention.\n\n'Oh! have you come by the same train?' he asked, shaking hands with\nher.\n\n'No. I've been waiting here because I wanted to see you, Mr.\nMumford. Will you spare me a minute or two?'\n\n'Here? In the station?'\n\n'Please--if you don't mind.'\n\nAstonished, Mumford drew aside with her to a quiet part of the long\nplatform. Louise, keeping a very grave countenance, told him rapidly\nall that had befallen since his departure from home in the morning.\n\n'I behaved horridly, and I was sorry for it as soon as I had left\nthe house. After all Mrs. Mumford's kindness to me, and yours, I\ndon't know how I could be so horrid. But the quarrel with mother had\nupset me so, and I felt so miserable when Mrs. Mumford seemed to\nwant to get rid of me. I feel sure she didn't really want to send me\naway: she was only advising me, as she thought, for my good. But I\ncan't, and won't, go home. And I've been waiting all the afternoon\nto see you. No; not here. I went to Epsom Downs and walked about,\nand then came back just in time. And--do you think I might go back?\nI don't mean now, at once, but this evening, after you've had\ndinner. I really don't know where to go for the night, and it's such\na stupid position to be in, isn't it?'\n\nWith perfect naivete, or with perfect simulation of it,\nshe looked him in the face, and it was Mumford who had to avert his\neyes. The young man felt very uncomfortable.\n\n'Oh! I'm quite sure Emmy will be glad to let you come for the night,\nMiss Derrick--'\n\n'Yes, but--Mr. Mumford, I want to stay longer--a few weeks longer.\nDo you think Mrs. Mumford would forgive me? I have made up my mind\nwhat to do, and I ought to have told her. I should have, if I hadn't\nlost my temper.'\n\n'Well,' replied the other, in grave embarrassment, but feeling that\nhe had no alternative, 'let us go to the house--'\n\n'Oh! I couldn't. I shouldn't like anyone to know that I spoke to you\nabout it. It wouldn't be nice, would it? I thought if I came later,\nafter dinner. And perhaps you could talk to Mrs. Mumford, and--and\nprepare her. I mean, perhaps you wouldn't mind saying you were sorry\nI had gone so suddenly. And then perhaps Mrs. Mumford--she's so\nkind--would say that she was sorry too. And then I might come into\nthe garden and find you both sitting there--'\n\nMumford, despite his most uneasy frame of mind, betrayed a passing\namusement. He looked into the girl's face and saw its prettiness\nflush with pretty confusion, and this did not tend to restore his\ntranquillity.\n\n'What shall you do in the meantime?'\n\n'Oh! go into the town and have something to eat, and then walk\nabout.'\n\n'You must be dreadfully tired already.'\n\n'Just a little; but I don't mind. It serves me right. I shall be so\ngrateful to you, Mr. Mumford. If you won't let me come, I suppose I\nmust go to London and ask one of my friends to take me in.'\n\n'I will arrange it. Come about half-past eight. We shall be in the\ngarden by then.'\n\nAvoiding her look, he moved away and ran up the stairs. But from the\nexit of the station he walked slowly, in part to calm himself, to\nassume his ordinary appearance, and in part to think over the comedy\nhe was going to play.\n\nEmmeline met him at the door, herself too much flurried to notice\nanything peculiar in her husband's aspect. She repeated the story\nwith which he was already acquainted.\n\n'And really, after all, I am so glad!' was her conclusion. 'I didn't\nthink she had really gone; all the afternoon I've been expecting to\nsee her back again. But she won't come now, and it is a good thing\nto have done with the wretched business. I only hope she will tell\nthe truth to her people. She might say that we turned her out of the\nhouse. But I don't think so; in spite of all her faults, she never\nseemed deceitful or malicious.'\n\nMumford was strongly tempted to reveal what had happened at the\nstation, but he saw danger alike in disclosure and in reticence.\n\nWhen there enters the slightest possibility of jealousy, a man can\nnever be sure that his wife will act as a rational being. He feared\nto tell the simple truth lest Emmeline should not believe his\ninnocence of previous plotting with Miss Derrick, or at all events\nshould be irritated by the circumstances into refusing Louise a\nlodging for the night. And with no less apprehension he decided at\nlength to keep the secret, which might so easily become known\nhereafter, and would then have such disagreeable consequences.\n\n'Well, let us have dinner, Emmy; I'm hungry. Yes, it's a good thing\nshe has gone; but I wish it hadn't happened in that way. What a\nspitfire she is!'\n\n'I never, never saw the like. And if you had heard Mrs. Higgins! Oh,\nwhat dreadful people! Clarence, hear me register a vow--'\n\n'It was my fault, dear. I'm awfully sorry I got you in for such\nhorrors. It was wholly and entirely my fault.'\n\nBy due insistence on this, Mumford of course put his wife into an\nexcellent humour, and, after they had dined, she returned to her\nregret that the girl should have gone so suddenly. Clarence,\ndeclaring that he would allow himself a cigar, instead of the usual\npipe, to celebrate the restoration of domestic peace, soon led\nEmmeline into the garden.\n\n'Heavens! how hot it has been. Eighty-five in our office at\nnoon--eighty-five! Fellows are discarding waistcoats and wearing\nwhat they call a cummerbund--silk sash round the waist. I think I\nmust follow the fashion. How should I look, do you think?'\n\n'You don't really mind that we lose the money?' Emmeline asked\npresently.\n\n'Pooh! We shall do well enough.--Who's that?'\n\nSomeone was entering the garden by the side path. And in a moment\nthere remained no doubt who the person was. Louise came forward, her\nhead bent, her features eloquent of fatigue and distress.\n\n'Mrs. Mumford--I couldn't--without asking you to forgive me--'\n\nHer voice broke with a sob. She stood in a humble attitude, and\nEmmeline, though pierced with vexation, had no choice but to hold\nout a welcoming hand.\n\n'Have you come all the way back from London just to say this?'\n\n'I haven't been to London. I've walked about--all day--and oh, I'm\nso tired and miserable! Will you let me stay, just for to-night? I\nshall be so grateful.'\n\n'Of course you may stay, Miss Derrick. It was very far from my wish\nto see you go off at a moment's notice. But I really couldn't stop\nyou.'\n\nMumford had stepped aside, out of hearing. He forgot his private\nembarrassment in speculation as to the young woman's character. That\nshe was acting distress and penitence he could hardly believe;\nindeed, there was no necessity to accuse her of dishonest behaviour.\nThe trivial concealment between him and her amounted to nothing, did\nnot alter the facts of the situation. But what could be at the root\nof her seemingly so foolish existence? Emmeline held to the view\nthat she was in love with the man Cobb, though perhaps unwilling to\nadmit it, even in her own silly mind. It might be so, and, _if_ so,\nit made her more interesting; for one was tempted to think that\nLouise had not the power of loving at all. Yet, for his own part, he\ncouldn't help liking her; the eyes that had looked into his at the\nstation haunted him a little, and would not let him think of her\ncontemptuously. But what a woman to make ones wife! Unless--unless--\n\nLouise had gone into the house. Emmeline approached her husband.\n\n'There! I foresaw it. Isn't vexing?'\n\n'Never mind, dear. She'll go to morrow, or the day after.'\n\n'I wish I could be sure of that.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nLouise did not appear again that evening. Thoroughly tired, she\nunpacked her trunks, sat awhile by the open window, listening to a\npiano in a neighbouring house, and then jumped into bed. From ten\no'clock to eight next morning she slept soundly.\n\nAt breakfast her behaviour was marked with excessive decorum. To the\nordinary civilities of her host and hostess she replied softly,\nmodestly, in the manner of a very young and timid girl; save when\naddressed, she kept silence, and sat with head inclined; a virginal\nfreshness breathed about her; she ate very little, and that without\nher usual gusto, but rather as if performing a dainty ceremony. Her\neyes never moved in Mumford's direction.\n\nThe threatened letter from Mrs. Higgins had arrived; Emmeline and\nher husband read it before their guest came down. If Louise\ncontinued to reside with them, they entertained her with a full\nknowledge that no payment must be expected from Coburg Lodge.\nEmmeline awaited the disclosure of her guest's project, which had\nmore than once been alluded to yesterday; she could not dream of\npermitting Louise to stay for more than a day or two, whatever the\nsuggestion offered. This morning she had again heard from her\nsister, Mrs. Grove, who was strongly of opinion that Miss Derrick\nshould be sent back to her native sphere.\n\n'I shall always feel,' she said to her husband, 'that we have\nbehaved badly. I was guilty of false pretences. Fortunately, we have\nthe excuse of her unbearable temper. But for that, I should feel\ndreadfully ashamed of myself.'\n\nVery soon after Mumford's departure, Louise begged for a few\nminutes' private talk.\n\n'Every time I come into this drawing-room, Mrs. Mumford, I think how\npretty it is. What pains you must have taken in furnishing it! I\nnever saw such nice curtains anywhere else. And that little\nscreen--I _am_ so fond of that screen!'\n\n'It was a wedding present from an old friend,' Emmeline replied,\ncomplacently regarding the object, which shone with embroidery of\nmany colours.\n\n'Will you help me when _I_ furnish _my_ drawing-room?' Louise asked\nsweetly. And she added, with a direct look, 'I don't think it will\nbe very long.'\n\n'Indeed?'\n\n'I am going to marry Mr. Bowling.'\n\nEmmeline could no longer feel astonishment at anything her guest said\nor did. The tone, the air, with which Louise made this declaration\naffected her with a sense of something quite unforeseen; but, at the\nsame time, she asked herself why she had not foreseen it. Was not\nthis the obvious answer to the riddle? All along, Louise had wished\nto marry Mr. Bowling. She might or might not have consciously helped\nto bring about the rupture between Mr. Bowling and Miss Higgins; she\nmight, or might not, have felt genuinely reluctant to take advantage\nof her half-sister's defeat. But a struggle had been going on in the\ngirl's conscience, at all events. Yes, this explained everything.\nAnd, on the whole, it seemed to speak in Louise's favour. Her\nridicule of Mr. Bowling's person and character became, in this new\nlight, a proof of desire to resist her inclinations. She had only\nyielded when it was certain that Miss Higgins's former lover had\nquite thrown off his old allegiance, and when no good could be done\nby self-sacrifice.\n\n'When did you make up your mind to this, Louise?'\n\n'Yesterday, after our horrid quarrel. No, _you_ didn't quarrel; it\nwas all my abominable temper. This morning I'm going to answer Mr.\nBowling's last letter, and I shall tell him--what I've told you.\nHe'll be delighted!'\n\n'Then you have really wished for this from the first?'\n\nLouise plucked at the fringe on the arm of her chair, and replied at\nlength with maidenly frankness.\n\n'I always thought it would be a good marriage for me. But I\nnever--do believe me--I never tried to cut Cissy out. The truth is I\nthought a good deal of the other--of Mr. Cobb. But I knew that I\n_couldn't_ marry him. It would be dreadful; we should quarrel\nfrightfully, and he would kill me--I feel sure he would, he's so\nviolent in his temper. But Mr. Bowling is very nice; he couldn't get\nangry if he tried. And he has a much better position than Mr. Cobb.'\n\nEmmeline began to waver in her conviction and to feel a natural\nannoyance.\n\n'And you think,' she said coldly, 'that your marriage will take\nplace soon?'\n\n'That's what I want to speak about, dear Mrs. Mumford. Did you hear\nfrom my mother this morning? Then you see what my position is. I am\nhomeless. If I leave you, I don't know where I shall go. When Mr.\nHiggins knows I'm going to marry Mr. Bowling he won't have me in\nthe house, even if I wanted to go back. Cissy will be furious:\nshe'll come back from Margate just to keep up her father's anger\nagainst me. If you could let me stay here just a short time, Mrs.\nMumford; just a few weeks I should _so_ like to be married from your\nhouse.'\n\nThe listener trembled with irritation, and before she could command\nher voice Louise added eagerly:\n\n'Of course, when we're married, Mr. Bowling will pay all my debts.'\n\n''You are quite mistaken,' said Emmeline distantly, 'if you think\nthat the money matter has anything to do with--with my unreadiness\nto agree--'\n\n'Oh, I didn't think it--not for a moment. I'm a trouble to you; I\nknow I am. But I'll be so quiet, dear Mrs. Mumford. You shall hardly\nknow I'm in the house. If once it's all settled I shall _never_ be\nout of temper. Do, please, let me stay! I like you so much, and how\nwretched it would be if I had to be married from a lodging-house.'\n\n'I'm afraid, Louise--I'm really afraid--'\n\n'Of my temper?' the girl interrupted. 'If ever I say an angry word\nyou shall turn me out that very moment. Dear Mrs. Mumford! Oh!\n_what_ shall I do if you won't be kind to me? What will become of\nme? I have no home, and everybody hates me.'\n\n'Tears streamed down her face; she lay back, overcome with misery.\nEmmeline was distracted. She felt herself powerless to act as\ncommon-sense dictated, yet desired more than ever to rid herself of\nevery shadow of responsibility for the girl's proceedings. The idea\nof this marriage taking place at \"Runnymede\" made her blood run\ncold. No, no; _that_ was absolutely out of the question. But equally\nimpossible did it seem to speak with brutal decision. Once more she\nmust temporise, and hope for courage on another day.\n\n'I can't--I really can't give you a definite answer till I have\nspoken with Mr. Mumford.'\n\n'Oh! I am sure he will do me this kindness,' sobbed Louise.\n\nA slight emphasis on the \"he\" touched Mrs. Mumford unpleasantly. She\nrose, and began to pick out some overblown flowers from a vase on\nthe table near her. Presently Louise became silent. Before either of\nthem spoke again a postman's knock sounded at the house-door, and\nEmmeline went to see what letter had been delivered. It was for Miss\nDerrick; the handwriting, as Emmeline knew, that of Mr. Cobb.\n\n'Oh, bother!' Louise murmured, as she took the letter from Mrs.\nMumford's hand. 'Well, I'm a trouble to everybody, and I don't know\nhow it'll all end. I daresay I shan't live very long.'\n\n'Don't talk nonsense, Louise.'\n\n'Should you like me to go at once, Mrs. Mumford?' the girl asked,\nwith a submissive sigh.\n\n'No, no. Let us think over it for a day or two. Perhaps you haven't\nquite made up your mind, after all.'\n\nTo this, oddly enough, Louise gave no reply. She lingered by the\nwindow, nervously bending and rolling her letter, which she did not\nseem to think of opening. After a glance or two of discreet\ncuriosity, Mrs. Mumford left the room. Daily duties called for\nattention, and she was not at all inclined to talk further with\nLouise. The girl, as soon as she found herself alone, broke Mr.\nCobb's envelope, which contained four sides of bold handwriting--not\na long letter, but, as usual, vigorously worded. 'Dear Miss\nDerrick,' he wrote, 'I haven't been in a hurry to reply to your\nlast, as it seemed to me that you were in one of your touchy moods\nwhen you sent it. It wasn't my fault that I called at the house when\nyou were away. I happened to have business at Croydon unexpectedly,\nand ran over to Sutton just on the chance of seeing you. And I have\nno objection to tell you all I said to your friend there. I am not\nin the habit of saying things behind people's backs that I don't\nwish them to hear. All I did was to ask out plainly whether Mrs. M.\nwas trying to persuade you to have nothing to do with me. She said\nshe wasn't, and that she didn't wish to interfere one way or\nanother. I told her that I could ask no more than that. She seemed\nto me a sensible sort of woman, and I don't suppose you'll get much\nharm from her, though I daresay she thinks more about dress and\namusements, and so on, than is good for her or anyone else. You say\nat the end of your letter that I'm to let you know when I think of\ncoming again, and if you mean by that that you would be glad to see\nme, I can only say, thank you. I don't mean to give you up yet, and\nI don't believe you want me to say what you will. I don't spy after\nyou; you're mistaken in that. But I'm pretty much always thinking\nabout you, and I wish you were nearer to me. I may have to go to\nBristol in a week or two, and perhaps I shall be there for a month\nor more, so I must see you before then. Will you tell me what day\nwould suit you, after seven? If you don't want me to come to the\nhouse, then meet me where you like. And there's only one more thing\nI have to say--you must deal honestly with me. I can wait, but I\nwon't be deceived.'\n\nLouise pondered for a long time, turning now to this part of the\nletter, now to that. And the lines of her face, though they made no\napproach to smiling, indicated agreeable thoughts. Tears had left\njust sufficient trace to give her meditations a semblance of\nunwonted seriousness.\n\nAbout midday she went up to her room and wrote letters. The first\nwas to Miss Cissy Higgins:--'Dear Ciss,--I dare say you would like\nto know that Mr. B. has proposed to me. If you have any objection,\nplease let me know it by return.--Affectionately yours, L. E.\nDERRICK.' This she addressed to Margate, and stamped with a little\nthump of the fist. Her next sheet of paper was devoted to Mr.\nBowling, and the letter, though brief, cost her some thought. 'Dear\nMr. Bowling,--Your last is so very nice and kind that I feel I ought\nto answer it without delay, but I cannot answer in the way you wish.\nI must have a long, long time to think over such a very important\nquestion. I don't blame you in the least for your behaviour to\nsomeone we know of; and I think, after all that happened, you were\nquite free. It is quite true that she did not behave\nstraightforwardly, and I am very sorry to have to say it. I shall\nnot be going home again: I have quite made up my mind about that. I\nam afraid I must not let you come here to call upon me. I have a\nparticular reason for it. To tell you the truth, my friend Mrs.\nMumford is _very_ particular, and rather fussy, and has a rather\ntrying temper. So please do not come just yet. I am quite well, and\nenjoying myself in a _very_ quiet way.--I remain, sincerely yours,\nLOUISE E. DERRICK.' Finally she penned a reply to Mr. Cobb, and\nthis, after a glance at a railway time-table, gave her no trouble at\nall. 'Dear Mr. Cobb,' she scribbled, 'if you really _must_ see me\nbefore you go away to Bristol, or wherever it is, you had better\nmeet me on Saturday at Streatham Station, which is about halfway\nbetween me and you. I shall come by the train from Sutton, which\nreaches Streatham at 8.6.--Yours truly, L. E. D.'\n\nTo-day was Thursday. When Saturday came the state of things at\n\"Runnymede\" had undergone no change whatever; Emmeline still waited\nfor a moment of courage, and Mumford, though he did not relish the\nprospect, began to think it more than probable that Miss Derrick\nwould hold her ground until her actual marriage with Mr. Bowling.\nWhether that unknown person would discharge the debt his betrothed\nwas incurring seemed an altogether uncertain matter. Louise, in the\nmeantime, kept quiet as a mouse--so strangely quiet, indeed, that\nEmmeline's prophetic soul dreaded some impending disturbance, worse\nthan any they had yet suffered.\n\nAt luncheon, Louise made known that she would have to leave in the\nmiddle of dinner to catch a train. No explanation was offered or\nasked, but Emmeline, it being Saturday, said she would put the\ndinner-hour earlier, to suit her friend's convenience. Louise smiled\npleasantly, and said how very kind it was of Mrs. Mumford.\n\nShe had no difficulty in reaching Streatham by the time appointed.\nUnfortunately, it was a cloudy evening, and a spattering of rain\nfell from time to time.\n\n'I suppose you'll be afraid to walk to the Common,' said Mr. Cobb,\nwho stood waiting at the exit from the station, and showed more\nsatisfaction in his countenance when Louise appeared than he evinced\nin words.\n\n'Oh, I don't care,' she answered. 'It won't rain much, and I've\nbrought my umbrella, and I've nothing on that will take any harm.'\n\nShe had, indeed, dressed herself in her least demonstrative costume.\nCobb wore the usual garb of his leisure hours, which was better than\nthat in which he had called the other day at \"Runnymede.\" For some\nminutes they walked towards Streatham Common without interchange of\na word, and with no glance at each other. Then the man coughed, and\nsaid bluntly that he was glad Louise had come.\n\n'Well, I wanted to see you,' was her answer.\n\n'What about?'\n\n'I don't think I shall be able to stay with the Mumfords. They're\nvery nice people, but they're not exactly my sort, and we don't get\non very well. Where had I better go?'\n\n'Go? Why home, of course. The best place for you.'\n\nCobb was prepared for a hot retort, but it did not come. After a\nmoment's reflection, Louise said quietly:\n\n'I can't go home. I've quarrelled with them too badly. You haven't\nseen mother lately? Then I must tell you how things are.'\n\nShe did so, with no concealment save of the correspondence with Mr.\nBowling, and the not unimportant statements concerning him which she\nhad made to Mrs. Mumford. In talking with Cobb, Louise seemed to\ndrop a degree or so in social status; her language was much less\ncareful than when she conversed with the Mumfords, and even her\nvoice struck a note of less refinement. Decidedly she was more\nherself, if that could be said of one who very rarely made conscious\ndisguise of her characteristics.\n\n'Better stay where you are, then, for the present,' said Cobb, when\nhe had listened attentively. 'I dare say you can get along well\nenough with the people, if you try.'\n\n'That's all very well; but what about paying them? I shall owe three\nguineas for every week I stop.'\n\n'It's a great deal, and they ought to feed you very well for it,'\nreplied the other, smiling rather sourly.\n\n'Don't be vulgar. I suppose you think I ought to live on a few\nshillings a week.'\n\n'Lots of people have to. But there's no reason why _you_ should. But\nlook here: why should you be quarrelling with your people now about\nthat fellow Bowling? You don't see him anywhere, do you?'\n\nHe flashed a glance at her, and Louise answered with a defiant\nmotion of the head.\n\n'No, I don't. But they put the blame on me, all the same. I\nshouldn't wonder if they think I'm trying to get him.'\n\nShe opened her umbrella, for heavy drops had begun to fall; they\npattered on Cobb's hard felt hat, and Louise tried to shelter him as\nwell as herself.\n\n'Never mind me,' he said. 'And here, let me hold that thing over\nyou. If you just put your arm in mine, it'll be easier. That's the\nway. Take two steps to my one; that's it.'\n\nAgain they were silent for a few moments. They had reached the\nCommon, and Cobb struck along a path most likely to be unfrequented.\nNo wind was blowing; the rain fell in steady spots that could all\nbut be counted, and the air grew dark.\n\n'Well, I can only propose one thing,' sounded the masculine voice.\n'You can get out of it by marrying me.'\n\nLouise gave a little laugh, rather timid than scornful.\n\n'Yes, I suppose I can. But it's an awkward way. It would be rather\nlike using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.'\n\n'It'll come sooner or later,' asserted Cobb, with genial confidence.\n\n'That's what I don't like about you.' Louise withdrew her arm\npetulantly. 'You always speak as if I couldn't help myself. Don't\nyou suppose I have any choice?'\n\n'Plenty, no doubt,' was the grim answer.\n\n'Whenever we begin to quarrel it's your fault,' pursued Miss\nDerrick, with unaccustomed moderation of tone. 'I never knew a man\nwho behaved like you do. You seem to think the way to make anyone\nlike you is to bully them. We should have got on very much better if\nyou had tried to be pleasant.'\n\n'I don't think we've got along badly, all things considered,' Cobb\nreplied, as if after weighing a doubt. 'We'd a good deal rather be\ntogether than apart, it seems to me; or else, why do we keep\nmeeting? And I don't want to bully anybody--least of all, you. It's\na way I have of talking, I suppose. You must judge a man by his\nactions and his meaning, not by the tone of his voice. You know very\nwell what a great deal I think of you. Of course I don't like it\nwhen you begin to speak as if you were only playing with me; nobody\nwould.'\n\n'I'm serious enough,' said Louise, trying to hold the umbrella over\nher companion, and only succeeding in directing moisture down the\nback of his neck. 'And it's partly through you that I've got into\nsuch difficulties.'\n\n'How do you make that out?'\n\n'If it wasn't for you, I should very likely marry Mr. Bowling.'\n\n'Oh, he's asked you, has he?' cried Cobb, staring at her. 'Why\ndidn't you tell me that before?--Don't let me stand in your way. I\ndare say he's just the kind of man for you. At all events, he's like\nyou in not knowing his own mind.'\n\n'Go on! Go on!' Louise exclaimed carelessly. 'There's plenty of\ntime. Say all you've got to say.'\n\nFrom the gloom of the eastward sky came a rattling of thunder, like\nquick pistol-shots. Cobb checked his steps.\n\n'We mustn't go any further. You're getting wet, and the rain isn't\nlikely to stop.'\n\n'I shall not go back,' Louise answered, 'until something has been\nsettled.' And she stood before him, her eyes cast down, whilst Cobb\nlooked at the darkening sky. 'I want to know what's going to become\nof me. The Mumfords won't keep me much longer, and I don't wish to\nstay where I'm not wanted.'\n\n'Let us walk down the hill.'\n\nA flash of lightning made Louise start, and the thunder rattled\nagain. But only light drops were falling. The girl stood her ground.\n\n'I want to know what I am to do. If you can't help me, say so, and\nlet me go my own way.'\n\n'Of course I can help you. That is, if you'll be honest with me. I\nwant to know, first of all, whether you've been encouraging that man\nBowling.'\n\n'No, I haven't.'\n\n'Very well, I believe you. And now I'll make you a fair offer. Marry\nme as soon as I can make the arrangements, and I'll pay all you owe,\nand see that you are in comfortable lodgings until I've time to get\na house. It could be done before I go to Bristol, and then, of\ncourse, you could go with me.'\n\n'You speak,' said Louise, after a short silence, 'just as if you\nwere making an agreement with a servant.'\n\n'That's all nonsense, and you know it. I've told you how I think,\noften enough, in letters, and I'm not good at saying it. Look here,\nI don't think it's very wise to stand out in the middle of the\nCommon in a thunderstorm. Let us walk on, and I think I would put\ndown your umbrella.'\n\n'It wouldn't trouble you much if I were struck with lightning.'\n\n'All right, take it so. I shan't trouble to contradict.'\n\nLouise followed his advice, and they began to walk quickly down the\nslope towards Streatham. Neither spoke until they were in the high\nroad again. A strong wind was driving the rain-clouds to other\nregions and the thunder had ceased; there came a grey twilight; rows\nof lamps made a shimmering upon the wet ways.\n\n'What sort of a house would you take?' Louise asked suddenly.\n\n'Oh, a decent enough house. What kind do you want?'\n\n'Something like the Mumfords'. It needn't be quite so large,' she\nadded quickly; 'but a house with a garden, in a nice road, and in a\nrespectable part.'\n\n'That would suit me well enough,' answered Cobb cheerfully. 'You\nseem to think I want to drag you down, but you're very much\nmistaken. I'm doing pretty well, and likely, as far as I can see, to\ndo better. I don't grudge you money; far from it. All I want to know\nis, that you'll marry me for my own sake.'\n\nHe dropped his voice, not to express tenderness, but because other\npeople were near. Upon Louise, however, it had a pleasing effect,\nand she smiled.\n\n'Very well,' she made answer, in the same subdued tone. 'Then let us\nsettle it in that way.'\n\nThey talked amicably for the rest of the time that they spent\ntogether. It was nearly an hour, and never before had they succeeded\nin conversing so long without a quarrel. Louise became light-hearted\nand mirthful; her companion, though less abandoned to the mood of\nthe moment, wore a hopeful countenance. Through all his roughness,\nCobb was distinguished by a personal delicacy which no doubt had\nimpressed Louise, say what she might of pretended fears. At parting,\nhe merely shook hands with her, as always.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nGlad of a free evening, Emmeline, after dinner, walked round to Mrs.\nFentiman's. Louise had put a restraint upon the wonted friendly\nintercourse between the Mumfords and their only familiar\nacquaintances at Sutton. Mrs. Fentiman liked to talk of purely\ndomestic matters, and in a stranger's presence she was never at\nease. Coming alone, and when the children were all safe in bed,\nEmmeline had a warm welcome. For the first time she spoke of her\ntroublesome guest without reserve. This chat would have been restful\nand enjoyable but for a most unfortunate remark that fell from the\nelder lady, a perfectly innocent mention of something her husband\nhad told her, but, secretly, so disturbing Mrs. Mumford that, after\nhearing it, she got away as soon as possible, and walked quickly\nhome with dark countenance.\n\nIt was ten o'clock; Louise had not yet returned, but might do so any\nmoment. Wishing to be sure of privacy in a conversation with her\nhusband, Emmeline summoned him from his book to the bedroom.\n\n'Well, what has happened now?' exclaimed Mumford. 'If this kind of\nthing goes on much longer I shall feel inclined to take a lodging in\ntown.'\n\n'I have heard something very strange. I can hardly believe it; there\nmust have been a mistake.'\n\n'What is it? Really, one's nerves--'\n\n'Is it true that, on Thursday evening, you and Miss Derrick were\nseen talking together at the station? Thursday: the day she went off\nand came back again after dinner.'\n\nMumford would gladly have got out of this scrape at any expense of\nmendacity, but he saw at once how useless such an attempt would\nprove. Exasperated by the result of his indiscretion, and resenting,\nas all men do, the undignified necessity of defending himself, he\nflew into a rage. Yes, it _was_ true, and what next? The girl had\nwaylaid him, begged him to intercede for her with his wife. Of\ncourse it would have been better to come home and reveal the matter;\nhe didn't do so because it seemed to put him in a silly position.\nFor Heaven's sake, let the whole absurd business be forgotten and\ndone with!\n\nEmmeline, though not sufficiently enlightened to be above small\njealousies, would have been ashamed to declare her feeling with the\nenergy of unsophisticated female nature. She replied coldly and\nloftily that the matter, of course, _was_ done with; that it\ninterested her no more; but that she could not help regretting an\ninstance of secretiveness such as she had never before discovered in\nher husband. Surely he had put himself in a much sillier position,\nas things turned out, than if he had followed the dictates of\nhonour.\n\n'The upshot of it is this,' cried Mumford: 'Miss Derrick has to\nleave the house, and, if necessary, I shall tell her so myself.'\n\nAgain Emmeline was cold and lofty. There was no necessity whatever\nfor any further communication between Clarence and Miss Derrick. Let\nthe affair be left entirely in her hands. Indeed, she must very\nspecially request that Clarence would have nothing more to do with\nMiss Derrick's business. Whereupon Mumford took offence. Did\nEmmeline wish to imply that there had been anything improper in his\nbehaviour beyond the paltry indiscretion to which he had confessed?\nNo; Emmeline was thankful to say that she did not harbour base\nsuspicions. Then, rejoined Mumford, let this be the last word of a\ndifference as hateful to him as to her. And he left the room.\n\nHis wife did not linger more than a minute behind him, and she sat\nin the drawing-room to await Miss Derrick's return; Mumford kept\napart in what was called the library. To her credit, Emmeline tried\nhard to believe that she had learnt the whole truth; her mind, as\nshe had justly declared, was not prone to ignoble imaginings; but\nacquitting her husband by no means involved an equal charity towards\nLouise. Hitherto uncertain in her judgment, she had now the relief\nof an assurance that Miss Derrick was not at all a proper person to\nentertain as a guest, on whatever terms. The incident of the railway\nstation proved her to be utterly lacking in self-respect, in\nfeminine modesty, even if her behaviour merited no darker\ndescription. Emmeline could now face with confidence the scene from\nwhich she had shrunk; not only was it a duty to insist upon Miss\nDerrick's departure, it would be a positive pleasure.\n\nLouise very soon entered; she came into the room with her brightest\nlook, and cried gaily:\n\n'Oh, I hope I haven't kept you waiting for me. Are you alone?'\n\n'No. I have been out.'\n\n'Had you the storm here? I'm not going to keep you talking; you look\ntired.'\n\n'I am rather,' said Emmeline, with reserve. She had no intention of\nallowing Louise to suspect the real cause of what she was about to\nsay--that would have seemed to her undignified; but she could not\nspeak quite naturally. 'Still, I should be glad if you would sit\ndown for a minute.'\n\nThe girl took a chair and began to draw off her gloves. She\nunderstood what was coming; it appeared in Emmeline's face.\n\n'Something to say to me, Mrs. Mumford?'\n\n'I hope you won't think me unkind. I feel obliged to ask you when\nyou will be able to make new arrangements.'\n\n'You would like me to go soon?' said Louise, inspecting her\nfinger-nails, and speaking without irritation.\n\n'I am sorry to say that I think it better you should leave us.\nForgive this plain speaking, Miss Derrick. It's always best to be\nperfectly straightforward, isn't it?'\n\nWhether she felt the force of this innuendo or not, Louise took it\nin good part. As if the idea had only just struck her, she looked up\ncheerfully.\n\n'You're quite right, Mrs. Mumford. I'm sure you've been very kind to\nme, and I've had a very pleasant time here, but it wouldn't do for\nme to stay longer. May I wait over to-morrow, just till Wednesday\nmorning, to have an answer to a letter?'\n\n'Certainly, if it is quite understood that there will be no delay\nbeyond that. There are circumstances--private matters--I don't feel\nquite able to explain. But I must be sure that you will have left us\nby Wednesday afternoon.'\n\n'You may be sure of it. I will write a line and post it to-night,\nfor it to go as soon as possible.'\n\nTherewith Louise stood up and, smiling, withdrew. Emmeline was both\nrelieved and surprised; she had not thought it possible for the girl\nto conduct herself at such a juncture with such perfect propriety.\nAn outbreak of ill-temper, perhaps of insolence, had seemed more\nthan likely; at best she looked for tears and entreaties. Well, it\nwas over, and by Wednesday the house would be restored to its\nancient calm. Ancient, indeed! One could not believe that so short a\ntime had passed since Miss Derrick first entered the portals. Only\none more day.\n\n'Oh, blindness to the future, kindly given, That each may fill the\ncircle marked by Heaven.' At school, Emmeline had learnt and recited\nthese lines; but it was long since they had recurred to her memory.\n\nIn ten minutes Louise had written her letter. She went out,\nreturned, and looked in at the drawing-room, with a pleasant smile.\n'Good-night, Mrs. Mumford.' 'Good-night, Miss Derrick.' For the\ngrace of the thing, Emmeline would have liked to say 'Louise,' but\ncould not bring her lips to utter the name.\n\nAbout a year ago there had been a little misunderstanding between\nMr. and Mrs. Mumford, which lasted for some twenty-four hours,\nduring which they had nothing to say to each other. To-night they\nfound themselves in a similar situation, and remembered that last\ndifference, and wondered, both of them, at the harmony of their\nmarried life. It was in truth wonderful enough; twelve months\nwithout a shadow of ill-feeling between them. The reflection\ncompelled Mumford to speak when his head was on the pillow.\n\n'Emmy, we're making fools of ourselves. Just tell me what you have\ndone.'\n\n'I can't see how _I_ am guilty of foolishness,' was the clear-cut\nreply.\n\n'Then why are you angry with me?'\n\n'I don't like deceit.'\n\n'Hanged if I don't dislike it just as much. When is that girl\ngoing?'\n\nEmmeline made known the understanding at which she had arrived, and\nher husband breathed an exclamation of profound thankfulness. But\npeace was not perfectly restored.\n\nIn another room, Louise lay communing with her thoughts, which were\nnot at all disagreeable. She had written to Cobb, telling him what\nhad happened, and asking him to let her know by Wednesday morning\nwhat she was to do. She could not go home; he must not bid her do\nso; but she would take a lodging wherever he liked. The position\nseemed romantic and enjoyable. Not till after her actual marriage\nshould the people at home know what had become of her. She was\nmarrying with utter disregard of all her dearest ambitions all the\nsame, she had rather be the wife of Cobb than of anyone else. Her\nstepfather might recover his old kindness and generosity as soon as\nhe knew she no longer stood in Cissy's way, and that she had never\nseriously thought of marrying Mr. Bowling. Had she not thought of\nit? The question did not enter her own mind, and she would have been\nquite incapable of passing a satisfactory cross-examination on the\nsubject.\n\nMrs. Mumford, foreseeing the difficulty of spending the next day at\nhome, told her husband in the morning that she would have early\nluncheon and go to see Mrs. Grove.\n\n'And I should like you to fetch me from there, after business,\nplease.'\n\n'I will,' answered Clarence readily. He mentally added a hope that\nhis wife did not mean to supervise him henceforth and for ever. If\nso, their troubles were only beginning.\n\nAt breakfast, Louise continued to be discretion itself. She talked\nof her departure on the morrow as though it had long been a settled\nthing, and was quite unconnected with disagreeable circumstances.\nOnly midway in the morning did Mrs. Mumford, who had been busy with\nher child, speak of the early luncheon and her journey to town. She\nhoped Miss Derrick would not mind being left alone.\n\n'Oh, don't speak of it,' answered Louise. 'I've lots to do. You'll\ngive my kind regards to Mrs. Grove?'\n\nSo they ate together at midday, rather silently, but with faces\ncomposed. And Emmeline, after a last look into the nursery, hastened\naway to catch her train. She had no misgivings; during her absence,\nall would be well as ever.\n\nLouise passed the time without difficulty, and at seven o'clock made\nan excellent dinner. This evening no reply could be expected from\nCobb, as he was not likely to have received her letter of last night\ntill his return home from business. Still, there might be something\nfrom someone; she always looked eagerly for the postman.\n\nThe weather was gloomy. Not long after eight the housemaid brought\nin a lighted lamp, and set it, as usual, upon the little black\nfour-legged table in the drawing-room. And in the same moment the\nknocker of the front door sounded a vigorous rat-tat-tat, a\nvisitor's summons.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\n'It may be someone calling upon me,' said Louise to the servant.\n'Let me know the name before you show anyone in.'\n\n'Of course, miss,' replied the domestic, with pert familiarity, and\ntook her time in arranging the shade of the lamp. When she returned\nfrom the door it was to announce, smilingly, that Mr. Cobb wished to\nsee Miss Derrick.\n\n'Please to show him in.'\n\nLouise stood in an attitude of joyous excitement, her eyes\nsparkling. But at the first glance she perceived that her lover's\nmood was by no means correspondingly gay. Cobb stalked forward and\nkept a stern gaze upon her, but said nothing.\n\n'Well? You got my letter, I suppose?'\n\n'What letter?'\n\nHe had not been home since breakfast-time, so Louise's appeal to him\nfor advice lay waiting his arrival. Impatiently, she described the\ncourse of events. As soon as she had finished, Cobb threw his hat\naside and addressed her harshly.\n\n'I want to know what you mean by writing to your sister that you are\ngoing to marry Bowling. I saw your mother this morning, and that's\nwhat she told me. It must have been only a day or two ago that you\nsaid that. Just explain, if you please. I'm about sick of this kind\nof thing, and I'll have the truth out of you.'\n\nHis anger had never taken such a form as this; for the first time\nLouise did in truth feel afraid of him. She shrank away, her heart\nthrobbed, and her tongue refused its office.\n\n'Say what you mean by it!' Cobb repeated, in a voice that was all\nthe more alarming because he kept it low.\n\n'Did you write that to your sister?'\n\n'Yes--but I never meant it--it was just to make her angry--'\n\n'You expect me to believe that? And, if it's true, doesn't it make\nyou out a nice sort of girl? But I don't believe it You've been\nthinking of him in that way all along; and you've been writing to\nhim, or meeting him, since you came here. What sort of behaviour do\nyou call this?'\n\nLouise was recovering self-possession; the irritability of her own\ntemper began to support her courage.\n\n'What if I have? I'd never given _you_ any promise till last night,\nhad I? I was free to marry anyone I liked, wasn't I? What do _you_\nmean by coming here and going on like this? I've told you the truth\nabout that letter, and I've always told you the truth about\neverything. If you don't like it, say so and go.'\n\nCobb was impressed by the energy of her defence. He looked her\nstraight in the eyes, and paused a moment; then spoke less\nviolently.\n\n'You haven't told me the _whole_ truth. I want to know when you saw\nBowling last.'\n\n'I haven't seen him since I left home.'\n\n'When did you write to him last?'\n\n'The same day I wrote to Cissy. And I shall answer no more\nquestions.'\n\n'Of course not. But that's quite enough. You've been playing a\ndouble game; if you haven't told lies, you've acted them. What sort\nof a wife would you make? How could I ever believe a word you said?\nI shall have no more to do with you.'\n\nHe turned away, and, in the violence of the movement, knocked over a\nlittle toy chair, one of those perfectly useless, and no less ugly,\nimpediments which stand about the floor of a well-furnished\ndrawing-room. Too angry to stoop and set the object on its legs\nagain, he strode towards the door. Louise followed him.\n\n'You are going?' she asked, in a struggling voice.\n\nCobb paid no attention, and all but reached the door. She laid a\nhand upon him.\n\n'You are going?'\n\nThe touch and the voice checked him. Again he turned abruptly and\nseized the hand that rested upon his arm.\n\n'Why are you stopping me? What do you want with me? I'm to help you\nout of the fix you've got into, is that it? I'm to find you a\nlodging, and take no end of trouble, and then in a week's time get a\nletter to say that you want nothing more to do with me.'\n\nLouise was pale with anger and fear, and as many other emotions as\nher little heart and brain could well hold. She did not look her\nbest--far from it but the man saw something in her eyes which threw\na fresh spell upon him. Still grasping her one hand, he caught her\nby the other arm, held her as far off as he could, and glared\npassionately as he spoke.\n\n'What do you want?'\n\n'You know--I've told you the truth--'\n\nHis grasp hurt her; she tried to release herself, and moved\nbackwards. For a moment Cobb left her free; she moved backward\nagain, her eyes drawing him on. She felt her power, and could not be\ncontent with thus much exercise of it.\n\n'You may go if you like. But you understand, if you do--'\n\nCobb, inflamed with desire and jealousy, made an effort to recapture\nher. Louise sprang away from him; but immediately behind her lay the\nfoolish little chair which he had kicked over, and just beyond\n_that_ stood the scarcely less foolish little table which supported\nthe heavy lamp, with its bowl of coloured glass and its spreading\nyellow shade. She tottered back, fell with all her weight against\nthe table, and brought the lamp crashing to the floor. A shriek of\nterror from Louise, from her lover a shout of alarm, blended with\nthe sound of breaking glass. In an instant a great flame shot up\nhalf way to the ceiling. The lamp-shade was ablaze; the\nmuch-embroidered screen, Mrs. Mumford's wedding present, forthwith\ncaught fire from a burning tongue that ran along the carpet; and\nLouise's dress, well sprinkled with paraffin, aided the\nconflagration. Cobb, of course, saw only the danger to the girl. He\nseized the woollen hearthrug and tried to wrap it about her; but\nwith screams of pain and frantic struggles, Louise did her best to\nthwart his purpose.\n\nThe window was open, and now a servant, rushing in to see what the\nuproar meant, gave the blaze every benefit of draught.\n\n'Bring water!' roared Cobb, who had just succeeded in extinguishing\nLouise's dress, and was carrying her, still despite her struggles,\nout of the room. 'Here, one of you take Miss Derrick to the next\nhouse. Bring water, you!'\n\nAll three servants were scampering and screeching about the hall.\nCobb caught hold of one of them and all but twisted her arm out of\nits socket. At his fierce command, the woman supported Louise into\nthe garden, and thence, after a minute or two of faintness on the\nsufferer's part, led her to the gate of the neighbouring house. The\npeople who lived there chanced to be taking the air on their front\nlawn. Without delay, Louise was conveyed beneath the roof, and her\nhost, a man of energy, sped towards the fire to be of what\nassistance he could.\n\nThe lamp-shade, the screen, the little table and the diminutive\nchair blazed gallantly, and with such a volleying of poisonous fumes\nthat Cobb could scarce hold his ground to do battle. Louise out of\nthe way, he at once became cool and resourceful. Before a flame\ncould reach the window he had rent down the flimsy curtains and\nflung them outside. Bellowing for the water which was so long in\ncoming, he used the hearthrug to some purpose on the outskirts of\nthe bonfire, but had to keep falling back for fresh air. Then\nappeared a pail and a can, which he emptied effectively, and next\nmoment sounded the voice of the gentleman from next door.\n\n'Have you a garden hose? Set it on to the tap, and bring it in\nhere.'\n\nThe hose was brought into play, and in no great time the last flame\nhad flickered out amid a deluge. When all danger was at an end, one\nof the servants, the nurse-girl, uttered a sudden shriek; it merely\nsignified that she had now thought for the first time of the little\nchild asleep upstairs. Aided by the housemaid, she rushed to the\nnursery, snatched her charge from bed, and carried the unhappy\nyoungster into the breezes of the night, where he screamed at the\ntop of his gamut.\n\nCobb, when he no longer feared that the house would be burnt down,\nhurried to inquire after Louise. She lay on a couch, wrapped in a\ndressing-gown; for the side and one sleeve of her dress had been\nburnt away. Her moaning never ceased; there was a fire-mark on the\nlower part of her face, and she stared with eyes of terror and\nanguish at whoever approached her. Already a doctor had been sent\nfor, and Cobb, reporting that all was safe at 'Runnymede,' wished to\nremove her at once to her own bed room, and the strangers were eager\nto assist.\n\n'What will the Mumfords say?' Louise asked of a sudden, trying to\nraise herself.\n\n'Leave all that to me,' Cobb replied reassuringly. 'I'll make it all\nright; don't trouble yourself.'\n\nThe nervous shock had made her powerless; they carried her in a\nchair back to 'Runnymede,' and upstairs to her bedroom. Scarcely was\nthis done when Mr. and Mrs. Mumford, after a leisurely walk from the\nstation, approached their garden gate. The sight of a little crowd\nof people in the quiet road, the smell of burning, loud voices of\nexcited servants, caused them to run forward in alarm. Emmeline,\nfrenzied by the certainty that her own house was on fire, began to\ncry aloud for her child, and Mumford rushed like a madman through\nthe garden.\n\n'It's all right,' said a man who stood in the doorway. 'You Mr.\nMumford? It's all right. There's been a fire, but we've got it out.'\n\nEmmeline learnt at the same moment that her child had suffered no\nharm, but she would not pause until she saw the little one and held\nhim in her embrace. Meanwhile, Cobb and Mumford talked in the\ndevastated drawing-room, which was illumined with candles.\n\n'It's a bad job, Mr. Mumford. My name is Cobb: I daresay you've\nheard of me. I came to see Miss Derrick, and I was clumsy enough to\nknock the lamp over.'\n\n'Knock the lamp over! How could you do that? Were you drunk?'\n\n'No, but you may well ask the question. I stumbled over something--a\nlittle chair, I think--and fell against the table with the lamp on\nit.'\n\n'Where's Miss Derrick?'\n\n'Upstairs. She got rather badly burnt, I'm afraid. We've sent for a\ndoctor.'\n\n'And here I am,' spoke a voice behind them. 'Sorry to see this, Mr.\nMumford.'\n\nThe two went upstairs together, and on the first landing encountered\nEmmeline, sobbing and wailing hysterically with the child in her\narms. Her husband spoke soothingly.\n\n'Don't, don't, Emmy. Here's Dr. Billings come to see Miss Derrick.\nShe's the only one that has been hurt. Go down, there's a good girl,\nand send somebody to help in Miss Derrick's room; you can't be any\nuse yourself just now.'\n\n'But how did it happen? Oh, _how_ did it happen?'\n\n'I'll come and tell you all about it. Better put the boy to bed\nagain, hadn't you?'\n\nWhen she had recovered her senses Emmeline took this advice, and,\nleaving the nurse by the child's cot, went down to survey the ruin\nof her property. It was a sorry sight. Where she had left a\nreception-room such as any suburban lady in moderate circumstances\nmight be proud of; she now beheld a mere mass of unrecognisable\nfurniture, heaped on what had once been a carpet, amid dripping\nwalls and under a grimed ceiling.\n\n'Oh! Oh!' She all but sank before the horror of the spectacle. Then,\nin a voice of fierce conviction, 'She did it! _She_ did it! It was\nbecause I told her to leave. I _know_ she did it on purpose!'\n\nMumford closed the door of the room, shutting out Cobb and the cook\nand the housemaid. He repeated the story Cobb had told him, and\nquietly urged the improbability of his wife's explanation. Miss\nDerrick, he pointed out, was lying prostrate from severe burns; the\nfire must have been accidental, but the accident, to be sure, was\nextraordinary enough. Thereupon Mrs. Mumford's wrath turned against\nCobb. What business had such a man--a low-class savage--in _her_\ndrawing-room? He must have come knowing that she and her husband\nwere away for the evening.\n\n'You can question him, if you like,' said Mumford. 'He's out there.'\n\nEmmeline opened the door, and at once heard a cry of pain from\nupstairs. Mumford, also hearing it, and seeing Cobb's\nmisery-stricken face by the light of the hall lamp, whispered to his\nwife:\n\n'Hadn't you better go up, dear? Dr. Billings may think it strange.'\n\nIt was much wiser to urge this consideration than to make a direct\nplea for mercy. Emmeline did not care to have it reported that\nselfish distress made her indifferent to the sufferings of a friend\nstaying in her house. But she could not pass Cobb without addressing\nhim severely.\n\n'So _you_ are the cause of this!'\n\n'I am, Mrs. Mumford, and I can only say that I'll do my best to make\ngood the damage to your house.'\n\n'Make good I fancy you have strange ideas of the value of the\nproperty destroyed.'\n\nInsolence was no characteristic of Mrs. Mumford. But calamity had\nput her beside herself; she spoke, not in her own person, but as a\nwoman whose carpets, curtains and bric-a-brac have\nignominiously perished.\n\n'I'll make it good,' Cobb repeated humbly, 'however long it takes\nme. And don't be angry with that poor girl, Mrs. Mumford. It wasn't\nher fault, not in any way. She didn't know I was coming; she hadn't\nasked me to come. I'm entirely to blame.'\n\n'You mean to say you knocked over the table by accident?'\n\n'I did indeed. And I wish I'd been burnt myself instead of her.'\n\nHe had suffered, by the way, no inconsiderable scorching, to which\nhis hands would testify for many a week; but of this he was still\nhardly aware. Emmeline, with a glance of uttermost scorn, left him,\nand ascended to the room where the doctor was busy. Free to behave\nas he thought fit, Mumford beckoned Cobb to follow him into the\nfront garden, where they conversed with masculine calm.\n\n'I shall put up at Sutton for the night,' said Cobb, 'and perhaps\nyou'll let me call the first thing in the morning to ask how she\ngets on.'\n\n'Of course. We'll see the doctor when he comes down. But I wish I\ncould understand how you managed to throw the lamp down.'\n\n'The truth is,' Cobb replied, 'we were quarrelling. I'd heard\nsomething about her that made me wild, and I came and behaved like a\nfool. I feel just now as if I could go and cut my throat, that's the\nfact. If anything happens to her, I believe I shall. I might as\nwell, in any case; she'll never look at me again.'\n\n'Oh, don't take such a dark view of it.'\n\nThe doctor came out, on his way to fetch certain requirements, and\nthe two men walked with him to his house in the next road. They\nlearned that Louise was not dangerously injured; her recovery would\nbe merely a matter of time and care. Cobb gave a description of the\nfire, and his hearers marvelled that the results were no worse.\n\n'You must have some burns too?' said the doctor, whose curiosity was\npiqued by everything he saw and heard of the strange occurrence. 'I\nthought so; those hands must be attended to.'\n\nMeanwhile, Emmeline sat by the bedside and listened to the\nhysterical lamentation in which Louise gave her own--the\ntrue--account of the catastrophe. It was all her fault, and upon her\nlet all the blame fall. She would humble herself to Mr. Higgins and\nget him to pay for the furniture destroyed. If Mrs. Mumford would\nbut forgive her! And so on, as her poor body agonised, and the blood\ngrew feverish in her veins.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\n'Accept it? Certainly. Why should we bear the loss if he's able to\nmake it good? He seems to be very well off for an unmarried man.'\n\n'Yes,' replied Mumford, 'but he's just going to marry, and it\nseems--Well, after all, you know, he didn't really cause the\ndamage. I should have felt much less scruple if Higgins had offered\nto pay--'\n\n'He _did_ cause the damage,' asseverated Emmeline. 'It was his gross\nor violent behaviour. If we had been insured it wouldn't matter so\nmuch. And pray let this be a warning, and insure at once. However\nyou look at it, he ought to pay.'\n\nEmmeline's temper had suffered much since she made the acquaintance\nof Miss Derrick. Aforetime, she could discuss difference of opinion;\nnow a hint of diversity drove her at once to the female weapon--angry\nand iterative assertion. Her native delicacy, also, seemed to\nhave degenerated. Mumford could only hold his tongue and trust that\nthis would be but a temporary obscurement of his wife's amiable\nvirtues.\n\nCobb had written from Bristol, a week after the accident, formally\nrequesting a statement of the pecuniary loss which the Mumfords had\nsuffered; he was resolved to repay them, and would do so, if\npossible, as soon as he knew the sum. Mumford felt a trifle ashamed\nto make the necessary declaration; at the outside, even with\nexpenses of painting and papering, their actual damage could not be\nestimated at more than fifty pounds, and even Emmeline did not wish\nto save appearances by making an excessive demand. The one costly\nobject in the room--the piano--was practically uninjured, and sundry\nother pieces of furniture could easily be restored; for Cobb and his\ncompanion, as amateur firemen, had by no means gone recklessly to\nwork. By candle-light, when the floor was still a swamp, things\nlooked more desperate than they proved to be on subsequent\ninvestigation; and it is wonderful at how little outlay, in our\nglistening times, a villa drawing-room may be fashionably equipped.\nSo Mumford wrote to his correspondent that only a few 'articles' had\nabsolutely perished; that it was not his wish to make any demand at\nall; but that, if Mr. Cobb insisted on offering restitution, why, a\nmatter of fifty pounds, etc. etc. And in a few days this sum\narrived, in the form of a draft upon respectable bankers.\n\nOf course the house was in grievous disorder. Upholsterers' workmen\nwould have been bad enough, but much worse was the establishment of\nMrs. Higgins by her daughter's bedside, which naturally involved her\npresence as a guest at table, and the endurance of her conversation\nwhenever she chose to come downstairs. Mumford urged his wife to\ntake her summer holiday--to go away with the child until all was put\nright again--a phrase which included the removal of Miss Derrick\nto her own home; but of this Emmeline would not hear. How could she\nenjoy an hour of mental quietude when, for all she knew, Mrs.\nHiggins and the patient might be throwing lamps at each other? And\nher jealousy was still active, though she did not allow it to betray\nitself in words. Clarence seemed to her quite needlessly anxious in\nhis inquiries concerning Miss Derrick's condition. Until that young\nlady had disappeared from 'Runnymede' for ever, Emmeline would keep\nmatronly watch and ward.\n\nMrs. Higgins declared at least a score of times every day that she\ncould _not_ understand how this dreadful affair had come to pass.\nThe most complete explanation from her daughter availed nothing; she\ndeemed the event an insoluble mystery, and, in familiar talk with\nMrs. Mumford, breathed singular charges against Louise's lover.\n'She's shielding him, my dear. I've no doubt of it. I never had a\nvery good opinion of him, but now she shall never marry him with\n_my_ consent.' To this kind of remark Emmeline at length deigned no\nreply. She grew to detest Mrs. Higgins, and escaped her society by\nevery possible manoeuvre.\n\n'Oh, how pleasant it is,' she explained bitterly to her husband, 'to\nthink that everybody in the road is talking about us with contempt!\nOf course the servants have spread nice stories. And the\nWilkinsons'--these were the people next door--'look upon us as\nhardly respectable. Even Mrs. Fentiman said yesterday that she\nreally could not conceive how I came to take that girl into the\nhouse. I acknowledged that I must have been crazy.'\n\n'Whilst we're thoroughly upset,' replied Mumford, with irritation at\nthis purposeless talk, 'hadn't we better leave the house and go to\nlive as far away as possible?'\n\n'Indeed, I very much wish we could. I don't think I shall ever be\nhappy again at Sutton.'\n\nAnd Clarence went off muttering to himself about the absurdity and\nthe selfishness of women.\n\nFor a week or ten days Louise lay very ill; then her vigorous\nconstitution began to assert itself. It helped her greatly towards\nconvalescence when she found that the scorches on her face would not\nleave a permanent blemish. Mrs. Mumford came into the room once a\nday and sat for a few minutes, neither of them desiring longer\ncommunion, but they managed to exchange inquiries and remarks with a\nshow of friendliness.  When the fifty pounds came from Cobb, Emmeline\nmade no mention of it. Louise said with an air of satisfaction,\n\n'So he has paid the money! I'm very glad of that.'\n\n'Mr. Cobb insisted on paying,' Mrs. Mumford answered with reserve.\n'We could not hurt his feelings by refusing.'\n\n'Well, that's all right, isn't it? You won't think so badly of us\nnow? Of course you wish you'd never set eyes on me, Mrs. Mumford;\nbut that's only natural: in your place I'm sure I should feel the\nsame. Still, now the money's paid, you won't always think unkindly\nof me, will you?'\n\nThe girl lay propped on pillows; her pale face, with its healing\nscars, bore witness to what she had undergone, and one of her arms\nwas completely swathed in bandages. Emmeline did not soften towards\nher, but the frank speech, the rather pathetic little smile, in\ndecency demanded a suave response.\n\n'I shall wish you every happiness, Louise.'\n\n'Thank you. We shall be married as soon as ever I'm well, but I'm\nsure I don't know where. Mother hates his very name, and does her\nbest to set me against him; but I just let her talk. We're beginning\nto quarrel a little--did you hear us this morning? I try to keep\ndown my voice, and I shan't be here much longer, you know. I shall\ngo home at first my stepfather has written a kind letter, and of\ncourse he's glad to know I shall marry Mr. Cobb. But I don't think\nthe wedding will be there. It wouldn't be nice to go to church in a\nrage, as I'm sure I should with mother and Cissy looking on.'\n\nThis might, or might not, signify a revival of the wish to be\nmarried from 'Runnymede.' Emmeline quickly passed to another\nsubject.\n\nMrs. Higgins was paying a visit to Coburg Lodge, where, during the\ndays of confusion, the master of the house had been left at his\nservants' mercy. On her return, late in the evening, she entered\nflurried and perspiring, and asked the servant who admitted her\nwhere Mrs. Mumford was.\n\n'With master, in the library, 'm.'\n\n'Tell her I wish to speak to her at once.'\n\nEmmeline came forth, and a lamp was lighted in the dining-room, for\nthe drawing-room had not yet been restored to a habitable condition.\nSilent, and wondering in gloomy resignation what new annoyance was\nprepared for her, Emmeline sat with eyes averted, whilst the stout\nwoman mopped her face and talked disconnectedly of the hardships of\ntravelling in such weather as this; when at length she reached her\npoint, Mrs. Higgins became lucid and emphatic.\n\n'I've heard things as have made me that angry I can hardly bear\nmyself. Would you believe that people are trying to take away my\ndaughter's character? It's Cissy 'Iggins's doing: I'm sure of it,\nthough I haven't brought it 'ome to her yet. I dropped in to see\nsome friends of ours--I shouldn't wonder if you know the name; it's\nMrs. Jolliffe, a niece of Mr. Baxter--Baxter, Lukin and Co., you\nknow. And she told me in confidence what people are saying--as how\nLouise was to marry Mr. Bowling, but he broke it off when he found\n_the sort of people she was living with_, here at Sutton--and a\ngreat many more things as I shouldn't like to tell you. Now what\n_do_ you think of--'\n\nEmmeline, her eyes flashing, broke in angrily:\n\n'I think nothing at all about it, Mrs. Higgins, and I had very much\nrather not hear the talk of such people.'\n\n'I don't wonder it aggravates you, Mrs. Mumford. Did anyone ever\nhear such a scandal! I'm sure nobody that knows you could say a word\nagainst your respectability, and, as I told Mrs. Jolliffe, she's\nquite at liberty to call here to-morrow or the next day--'\n\n'Not to see _me_, I hope,' said Emmeline. 'I must refuse--'\n\n'Now just let me tell you what I've thought,' pursued the stout\nlady, hardly aware of this interruption. 'This'll have to be set\nright, both for Lou's sake and for yours, and to satisfy us all.\nThey're making a mystery, d'you see, of Lou leaving 'ome and going\noff to live with strangers; and Cissy's been doing her best to make\npeople think there's something wrong--the spiteful creature! And\nthere's only one way of setting it right. As soon as Lou can be\ndressed and got down, and when the drawing-room's finished, I want\nher to ask all our friends here to five o'clock tea, just to let\nthem see with their own eyes--'\n\n'Mrs. Higgins!'\n\n'Of course there'll be no expense for _you_, Mrs. Mumford--not a\nfarthing. I'll provide everything, and all I ask of you is just to\nsit in your own drawing-room--'\n\n'Mrs. Higgins, be so kind as to listen to me. This is quite\nimpossible. I can't dream of allowing any such thing.'\n\nThe other glared in astonishment, which tended to wrath.\n\n'But can't you see, Mrs. Mumford, that it's for your _own_ good as\nwell as ours? Do you want people to be using your name--'\n\n'What can it matter to me how _such_ people think or speak of me?'\ncried Emmeline, trembling with exasperation.\n\n'Such people! I don't think you know who you're talking about, Mrs.\nMumford. You'll let me tell you that my friends are as respectable\nas yours--'\n\n'I shall not argue about it,' said Emmeline, standing up. 'You will\nplease to remember that already I've had a great deal of trouble and\nannoyance, and what you propose would be quite intolerable. Once for\nall, I can't dream of such a thing.'\n\n'Then all I can say is, Mrs. Mumford'--the speaker rose with heavy\ndignity--'that you're not behaving in a very ladylike way. I'm not a\nquarrelsome person, as you well know, and I don't say nasty things\nif I can help it. But there's one thing I _must_ say and _will_ say,\nand that is, that when we first came here you gave a very different\naccount of yourself to what it's turned out. You told me and my\ndaughter distinctly that you had a great deal of the very best\nsociety, and that was what Lou came here _for_, and you knew it, and\nyou can't deny that you did. And I should like to know how much\nsociety she's seen all the time she's been here--that's the question\nI _ask_ you. I don't believe she's seen more than three or four\npeople altogether. They may have been respectable enough, and I'm\nnot the one to say they weren't, but I _do_ say it isn't what we was\nled to expect, and that you can't deny, Mrs. Mumford.'\n\nShe paused for breath. Emmeline had moved towards the door, and\nstood struggling with the feminine rage which impelled her to\nundignified altercation. To withdraw in silence would be like a\nshamed confession of the charge brought against her, and she\nsuffered not a little from her consciousness of the modicum of truth\ntherein.\n\n'It was a most unfortunate thing, Mrs. Higgins,' burst from her\nlips, 'that I ever consented to receive your daughter, knowing as I\ndid that she wasn't our social equal.'\n\n'Wasn't _what_?' exclaimed the other, as though the suggestion\nstartled her by its novelty. 'You think yourself superior to us? You\ndid us a favour--'\n\nWhilst Mrs. Higgins was uttering these words the door opened, and\nthere entered a figure which startled her into silence. It was that\nof Louise, in a dressing-gown and slippers, with a shawl wrapped\nabout the upper part of her body.\n\n'I heard you quarrelling,' she began. (Her bedroom was immediately\nabove, and at this silent hour the voices of the angry ladies had\nbeen quite audible to her as she lay in bed.) 'What _is_ it all\nabout? It's too bad of you, mother--'\n\n'The idea, Louise, of coming down like that!' cried her parent\nindignantly. 'How did you know Mr. Mumford wasn't here? For shame!\nGo up again this moment.'\n\n'I don't see any harm if Mr. Mumford had been here,' replied the\ngirl calmly.\n\n'I'm sure it's most unwise of you to leave your bed,' began\nEmmeline, with anxious thought for Louise's health, due probably to\nher dread of having the girl in the house for an indefinite period.\n\n'Oh, I've wrapped up. I feel shaky, that's all, and I shall have to\nsit down.' She did so, on the nearest chair, with a little laugh at\nher strange feebleness.\n\n'Now please _don't_ quarrel, you two. Mrs. Mumford, don't mind\nanything that mother says.'\n\nThereupon Louise's mother burst into a vehement exposition of the\nreasons of discord, beginning with the calumnious stories she had\nheard at Mrs. Jolliffe's, and ending with the outrageous arrogance\nof Mrs. Mumford's latest remark. Louise listened with a smile.\n\n'Now look here, mother,' she said, when silence came for a moment,\n'you can't expect Mrs. Mumford to have a lot of strangers coming to\nthe house just on my account. She's sick and tired of us all, and\nwants to see our backs as soon as ever she can. I don't say it to\noffend you, Mrs. Mumford, but you know it's true. And I tell you\nwhat it is: To-morrow morning I'm going back home. Yes, I am. You\ncan't stay here, mother, after this, and I'm not going to have\nanyone new to wait on me. I shall go home in a cab, straight from\nthis house to the other, and I'm quite sure I shan't take any harm.'\n\n'You won't do it till the doctor's given you leave,' said Mrs.\nHiggins with concern.\n\n'He'll be here at ten in the morning, and I know he will give me\nleave. So there's an end of it. And you can go to bed and sleep in\npeace, Mrs. Mumford.'\n\nIt was not at all unamiably said. But for Mrs. Higgins's presence,\nEmmeline would have responded with a certain kindness. Still\nsmarting under the stout lady's accusations, which continued to\nsound in sniffs and snorts, she answered as austerely as possible.\n\n'I must leave you to judge, Miss Derrick, how soon you feel able to\ngo. I don't wish you to do anything imprudent. But it will be much\nbetter if Mrs. Higgins regards me as a stranger during the rest of\nher stay here. Any communication she wishes to make to me must be\nmade through a servant.'\n\nHaving thus delivered herself; Emmeline quitted the room. From the\nlibrary, of which the door was left ajar, she heard Louise and her\nmother pass upstairs, both silent. Mumford, too well aware that yet\nanother disturbance had come upon his unhappy household, affected to\nread, and it was only when the door of Louise's room had closed that\nEmmeline spoke to him.\n\n'Mrs. Higgins will breakfast by herself to-morrow,' she said\nseverely. 'She may perhaps go before lunch; but in any case we shall\nnot sit down at table with her again.'\n\n'All right,' Mumford replied, studiously refraining from any hint of\ncuriosity.\n\nSo, next morning, their breakfast was served in the library. Mrs.\nHiggins came down at the usual hour, found the dining-room at her\ndisposal, and ate with customary appetite, alone. Had Emmeline's\nexperience lain among the more vigorously vulgar of her sex she\nwould have marvelled at Mrs. Higgins's silence and general\nself-restraint during these last hours. Louise's mother might,\nwithout transgressing the probabilities of the situation, have made\nthis a memorable morning indeed. She confined herself to a rather\nfrequent ringing of the bedroom bell. Her requests of the servants\nbecame orders, such as she would have given in a hotel or\nlodging-house, but no distinctly offensive word escaped her. And\nthis was almost entirely due to Louise's influence for the girl\nimpressed upon her mother that 'to make a row' would be the sure and\ncertain way of proving that Mrs. Mumford was justified in claiming\nsocial superiority over her guests.\n\nThe doctor, easily perceiving how matters stood, made no difficulty\nabout the patient's removal in a closed carriage, and, with exercise\nof all obvious precautions, she might travel as soon as she liked.\nAnticipating this, Mrs. Higgins had already packed all the luggage,\nand Louise, as well as it could be managed, had been clad for the\njourney.\n\n'I suppose you'll go and order the cab yourself?' she said to her\nmother, when they were alone again.\n\n'Yes, I must, on account of making a bargain about the charge. A\nnice expense you've been to us, Louise. That man ought to pay every\npenny.'\n\n'I'll tell him you say so, and no doubt he will.'\n\nThey wrangled about this whilst Mrs. Higgins was dressing to go out.\nAs soon as her mother had left the house Louise stole downstairs and\nto the door of the drawing-room, which was half open. Emmeline, her\nback turned, stood before the fireplace, as if considering some new\nplan of decoration; she did not hear the girl's light step.\nWhitewashers and paperhangers had done their work; a new carpet was\nlaid down; but pictures had still to be restored to their places,\nand the furniture stood all together in the middle of the room. Not\ntill Louise had entered did her hostess look round.\n\n'Mrs. Mumford, I want to say good-bye.'\n\n'Oh, yes,' Emmeline answered civilly, but without a smile.\n'Good-bye, Miss Derrick.'\n\nAnd she stepped forward to shake hands.\n\n'Don't be afraid,' said the girl, looking into her face\ngood-humouredly. 'You shall never see me again unless you wish to.'\n\n'I'm sure I wish you all happiness,' was the embarrassed reply.\n'And--I shall be glad to hear of your marriage.'\n\n'I'll write to you about it. But you won't talk--unkindly about me\nwhen I've gone--you and Mr. Mumford?'\n\n'No, no; indeed we shall not.'\n\nLouise tried to say something else, but without success. She pressed\nEmmeline's hand, turned quickly, and disappeared. In half-an-hour's\ntime arrived the vehicle Mrs. Higgins had engaged; without delay\nmother and daughter left the house, and were driven off. Mrs.\nMumford kept a strict retirement. When the two had gone she learnt\nfrom the housemaid that their luggage would be removed later in the\nday.\n\nA fortnight passed, and the Mumfords once more lived in\nenjoyment of tranquillity, though Emmeline could not quite recover\nher old self. They never spoke of the dread experiences through\nwhich they had gone. Mumford's holiday time approached, and they\nwere making arrangements for a visit to the seaside, when one\nmorning a carrier's cart delivered a large package, unexpected and\nof unknown contents. Emmeline stripped off the matting, and found--a\ndrawing-room screen, not unlike that which she had lost in the\nfire. Of course it came from Louise, and, though she professed\nherself very much annoyed, Mrs. Mumford had no choice but to\nacknowledge it in a civil little note addressed to Coburg Lodge.\n\nThey were away from home for three weeks. On returning, Emmeline\nfound a letter which had arrived for her the day before; it was from\nLouise, and announced her marriage. 'Dear Mrs. Mumford,--I know\nyou'll be glad to hear it's all over. It was to have been at the end\nof October, when our house was ready for us. We have taken a very\nnice one at Holloway. But of course something happened, and mother\nand Cissy and I quarrelled so dreadfully that I went off and took a\nlodging. And then Tom said that we must be married at once; and so\nwe were, without any fuss at all, and I think it was ever so much\nbetter, though some girls would not care to go in their plain dress\nand without friends or anything. After it was over, Tom and I had\njust a little disagreement about something, but of course he gave\nway, and I don't think we shall get on together at all badly. My\nstepfather has been very nice, and is paying for all the furniture,\nand has promised me a lot of things. Of course he is delighted to\nsee me out of the house, just as you were. You see that I write from\nBroadstairs, where we are spending our honeymoon. Please remember me\nto Mr. Mumford, and believe me, very sincerely yours, Louise L.\nCobb.'\n\nEnclosed was a wedding-card.\n\n'Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Cobb,' in gilt lettering, occupied the middle,\nand across the right-hand upper corner ran 'Louise E. Derrick,' an\narrow transfixing the maiden surname.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Paying Guest, by George Gissing\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PAYING GUEST ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4298.txt or 4298.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/2\/9\/4298\/\n\nProduced by Charles Aldarondo.

To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1055,"split":"train"}
