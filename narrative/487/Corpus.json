For ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.\"\nJohn Hodder is recruited from a small town and congregation somewhere in the East to become rector of the august St. John's Church in a large midwestern city (modeled on St. Louis). Originally built in a rich area of the city, the surrounding area of the church including now-infamous \"Dalton Street\" has fallen into decay. But the church patrons include the wealthiest of the city, who travel to church on Sunday from their new mansions on the west side of the city, and who desire an \"orthodox\" minister who will preach a Christianity which will not question the growth of corporate power and the corrupting influence of concentrating wealth in America. Hodder develops a close friendship with Eldon Parr, the most wealthy and powerful man in the church. This is remarkable in that Parr has few close friends. Hodder comes to know of Parr's intense loneliness and unhappiness, being widowed and estranged from his son and daughter.\nHodder's failure to move his congregation causes him a spiritual crisis. He meets Josiah Bentley, one of founders of the church who left when financially devastated by Parr, but who has developed a network for helping the poor in the neighborhood surrounding the church. Hodder eventually disregards his \"orthodox\" views and preaches what he understands to be the core teachings of Jesus - to love and serve mankind. This spawns a huge battle between the old guard at the church and those who are deeply touched by Hodder's message, including Parr's daughter Alison. Though deprived of his salary by the vestry, the bishop is heartened by Hodder's transformation and tells him he will not recommend him for an ecclesiastical trial for heresy.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Inside of the Cup, Complete, by Winston Churchill\n[Author is the American Winston Churchill not the British]\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

THE WARING PROBLEMS\n\n\nI\n\nWith few exceptions, the incidents recorded in these pages take place in\none of the largest cities of the United States of America, and of\nthat portion called the Middle West,--a city once conservative and\nprovincial, and rather proud of these qualities; but now outgrown them,\nand linked by lightning limited trains to other teeming centers of the\nmodern world: a city overtaken, in recent years, by the plague which has\nswept our country from the Atlantic to the Pacific--Prosperity. Before\nits advent, the Goodriches and Gores, the Warings, the Prestons and the\nAtterburys lived leisurely lives in a sleepy quarter of shade trees\nand spacious yards and muddy macadam streets, now passed away forever.\nExistence was decorous, marriage an irrevocable step, wives were wives,\nand the Authorized Version of the Bible was true from cover to cover. So\nDr. Gilman preached, and so they believed.\n\nSunday was then a day essentially different from other days--you could\ntell it without looking at the calendar. The sun knew it, and changed\nthe quality of his light the very animals, dogs and cats and horses,\nknew it: and most of all the children knew it, by Sunday school, by Dr.\nGilman's sermon, by a dizzy afternoon connected in some of their minds\nwith ceramics and a lack of exercise; by a cold tea, and by church\nbells. You were not allowed to forget it for one instant. The city\nsuddenly became full of churches, as though they had magically been let\ndown from heaven during Saturday night. They must have been there on\nweek days, but few persons ever thought of them.\n\nAmong the many church bells that rang on those bygone Sundays was that\nof St. John's, of which Dr. Gilman, of beloved memory, was rector. Dr.\nGilman was a saint, and if you had had the good luck to be baptized or\nmarried or buried by him, you were probably fortunate in an earthly as\nwell as heavenly sense. One has to be careful not to deal exclusively in\nsuperlatives, and yet it is not an exaggeration to say that St. John's\nwas the most beautiful and churchly edifice in the city, thanks\nchiefly to several gentlemen of sense, and one gentleman, at least, of\ntaste--Mr. Horace Bentley. The vicissitudes of civil war interrupted its\nbuilding; but when, in 1868, it stood completed, its stone unsoiled as\nyet by factory smoke, its spire delicately pointing to untainted skies,\nits rose window glowing above the porch, citizens on Tower Street often\nstopped to gaze at it diagonally across the vacant lot set in order by\nMr. Thurston Gore, with the intent that the view might be unobstructed.\n\nLittle did the Goodriches and Gores, the Warings and Prestons and\nAtterburys and other prominent people foresee the havoc that prosperity\nand smoke were to play with their residential plans! One by one, sooty\ncommerce drove them out, westward, conservative though they were, from\nthe paradise they had created; blacker and blacker grew the gothic\nfacade of St. John's; Thurston Gore departed, but leased his corner\nfirst for a goodly sum, his ancestors being from Connecticut; leased\nalso the vacant lot he had beautified, where stores arose and hid the\nspire from Tower Street. Cable cars moved serenely up the long hill\nwhere a panting third horse had been necessary, cable cars resounded in\nBurton Street, between the new factory and the church where Dr. Gilman\nstill preached of peace and the delights of the New-Jerusalem. And\nbefore you could draw your breath, the cable cars had become electric.\nGray hairs began to appear in the heads of the people Dr. Gilman had\nmarried in the '60's and their children were going East to College.\n\n\n\nII\n\nIn the first decade of the twentieth century, Asa, Waring still clung to\nthe imposing, early Victorian mansion in Hamilton Street. It presented\nan uncompromising and rather scornful front to the sister mansions with\nwhich it had hitherto been on intimate terms, now fast degenerating into\na shabby gentility, seeking covertly to catch the eye of boarders, but\nas yet refraining from open solicitation. Their lawns were growing a\nlittle ragged, their stone steps and copings revealing cracks.\n\nAsa Waring looked with a stern distaste upon certain aspects of modern\nlife. And though he possessed the means to follow his friends and\nerstwhile neighbours into the newer paradise five miles westward, he had\nsuccessfully resisted for several years a formidable campaign to\nuproot him. His three married daughters lived in that clean and verdant\ndistrict surrounding the Park (spelled with a capital), while Evelyn and\nRex spent most of their time in the West End or at the Country Clubs.\nEven Mrs. Waring, who resembled a Roman matron, with her wavy white\nhair parted in the middle and her gentle yet classic features, sighed\nsecretly at times at the unyielding attitude of her husband, although\nadmiring him for it. The grandchildren drew her.\n\nOn the occasion of Sunday dinner, when they surrounded her, her heart\nwas filled to overflowing.\n\nThe autumn sunlight, reddened somewhat by the slight haze of smoke,\npoured in at the high windows of the dining-room, glinted on the silver,\nand was split into bewildering colors by the prisms of the chandelier.\nMany precious extra leaves were inserted under the white cloth, and Mrs.\nWaring's eyes were often dimmed with happiness as she glanced along\nthe ranks on either side until they rested on the man with whom she had\nchosen to pass her life. Her admiration for him had gradually grown into\nhero-worship. His anger, sometimes roused, had a terrible moral quality\nthat never failed to thrill her, and the Loyal Legion button on his\nblack frock coat seemed to her an epitome of his character. He sat for\nthe most part silent, his remarkable, penetrating eyes, lighting\nunder his grizzled brows, smiling at her, at the children, at the\ngrandchildren. And sometimes he would go to the corner table, where the\nfour littlest sat, and fetch one back to perch on his knee and pull at\nhis white, military mustache.\n\nIt was the children's day. Uproar greeted the huge white cylinder\nof ice-cream borne by Katie, the senior of the elderly maids; uproar\ngreeted the cake; and finally there was a rush for the chocolates,\nlittle tablets wrapped in tinfoil and tied with red and blue ribbon.\nAfter that, the pandemonium left the dining-room, to spread itself over\nthe spacious house from the basement to the great playroom in the attic,\nwhere the dolls and blocks and hobby-horses of the parental generation\nstoically awaited the new.\n\nSometimes a visitor was admitted to this sacramental feat, the dearest\nold gentleman in the world, with a great, high bridged nose, a slight\nstoop, a kindling look, and snow white hair, though the top of his\nhead was bald. He sat on Mrs. Waring's right, and was treated with the\ngreatest deference by the elders, and with none at all by the children,\nwho besieged him. The bigger ones knew that he had had what is called\na history; that he had been rich once, with a great mansion of his own,\nbut now he lived on Dalton Street, almost in the slums, and worked among\nthe poor. His name was Mr. Bentley.\n\nHe was not there on the particular Sunday when this story opens,\notherwise the conversation about to be recorded would not have taken\nplace. For St. John's Church was not often mentioned in Mr. Bentley's\npresence.\n\n\"Well, grandmother,\" said Phil Goodrich, who was the favourite\nson-in-law, \"how was the new rector to-day?\"\n\n\"Mr. Hodder is a remarkable young man, Phil,\" Mrs. Waring declared, \"and\ndelivered such a good sermon. I couldn't help wishing that you and Rex\nand Evelyn and George had been in church.\"\n\n\"Phil couldn't go,\" explained the unmarried and sunburned Evelyn, \"he\nhad a match on of eighteen holes with me.\"\n\nMrs. Waring sighed.\n\n\"I can't think what's got into the younger people these days that they\nseem so indifferent to religion. Your father's a vestryman, Phil, and\nI believe it has always been his hope that you would succeed him. I'm\nafraid Rex won't succeed his father,\" she added, with a touch of regret\nand a glance of pride at her husband. \"You never go to church, Rex. Phil\ndoes.\"\n\n\"I got enough church at boarding-school to last me a lifetime, mother,\"\nher son replied. He was slightly older than Evelyn, and just out of\ncollege. \"Besides, any heathen can get on the vestry--it's a financial\nboard, and they're due to put Phil on some day. They're always putting\nhim on boards.\"\n\nHis mother looked a little distressed.\n\n\"Rex, I wish you wouldn't talk that way about the Church--\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, mother,\" he said, with quick penitence. \"Mr. Langmaid's a\nvestryman, you know, and they've only got him there because he's the\nbest corporation lawyer in the city. He isn't exactly what you'd call\northodox. He never goes.\"\n\n\"We are indebted to Mr. Langmaid for Mr. Hodder.\" This was one of Mr.\nWaring's rare remarks.\n\nEleanor Goodrich caught her husband's eye, and smiled.\n\n\"I wonder why it is,\" she said, \"that we are so luke-warm about church\nin these days? I don't mean you, Lucy, or Laureston,\" she added to her\nsister, Mrs. Grey. \"You're both exemplary.\" Lucy bowed ironically. \"But\nmost people of our ages with whom we associate. Martha Preston, for\ninstance. We were all brought up like the children of Jonathan Edwards.\nDo you remember that awful round-and-round feeling on Sunday afternoons,\nSally, and only the wabbly Noah's Ark elephant to play with, right in\nthis house? instead of THAT!\" There was a bump in the hall without, and\nshrieks of laughter. \"I'll never forget the first time it occurred to\nme--when I was reading Darwin--that if the ark were as large as Barnum's\nCircus and the Natural History Museum put together, it couldn't have\nheld a thousandth of the species on earth. It was a blow.\"\n\n\"I don't know what we're coming to,\" exclaimed Mrs. Waring gently.\n\n\"I didn't mean to be flippant, mother,\" said Eleanor penitently, \"but I\ndo believe the Christian religion has got to be presented in a different\nway, and a more vital way, to appeal to a new generation. I am merely\nlooking facts in the face.\"\n\n\"What is the Christian religion?\" asked Sally's husband, George Bridges,\nwho held a chair of history in the local flourishing university. \"I've\nbeen trying to find out all my life.\"\n\n\"You couldn't be expected to know, George,\" said his wife. \"You were\nbrought up an Unitarian, and went to Harvard.\"\n\n\"Never mind, professor,\" said Phil Goodrich, in a quizzical,\naffectionate tone. \"Take the floor and tell us what it isn't.\"\n\nGeorge Bridges smiled. He was a striking contrast in type to his\nsquare-cut and vigorous brother-in-law; very thin, with slightly\nprotruding eyes the color of the faded blue glaze of ancient pottery,\nand yet humorous.\n\n\"I've had my chance, at any rate. Sally made me go last Sunday and hear\nMr. Hodder.\"\n\n\"I can't see why you didn't like him, George,\" Lucy cried. \"I think he's\nsplendid.\"\n\n\"Oh, I like him,\" said Mr. Bridges.\n\n\"That's just it!\" exclaimed Eleanor. \"I like him. I think he's sincere.\nAnd that first Sunday he came, when I saw him get up in the pulpit and\nwave that long arm of his, all I could think of was a modern Savonarola.\nHe looks one. And then, when he began to preach, it was maddening. I\nfelt all the time that he could say something helpful, if he only would.\nBut he didn't. It was all about the sufficiency of grace,--whatever that\nmay be. He didn't explain it. He didn't give me one notion as to how to\ncope a little better with the frightful complexities of the modern\nlives we live, or how to stop quarrelling with Phil when he stays at the\noffice and is late for dinner.\"\n\n\"Eleanor, I think you're unjust to him,\" said Lucy, amid the laughter\nof the men of the family. \"Most people in St. John's think he is a\nremarkable preacher.\"\n\n\"So were many of the Greek sophists,\" George Bridges observed.\n\n\"Now if it were only dear old Doctor Gilman,\" Eleanor continued, \"I\ncould sink back into a comfortable indifference. But every Sunday this\nnew man stirs me up, not by what he says, but by what he is. I hoped\nwe'd get a rector with modern ideas, who would be able to tell me what\nto teach my children. Little Phil and Harriet come back from Sunday\nschool with all sorts of questions, and I feel like a hypocrite. At\nany rate, if Mr. Hodder hasn't done anything else, he's made me want to\nknow.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by a man of modern ideas, Eleanor?\" inquired Mr.\nBridges, with evident relish.\n\nEleanor put down her coffee cup, looked at him helplessly, and smiled.\n\n\"Somebody who will present Christianity to me in such a manner that it\nwill appeal to my reason, and enable me to assimilate it into my life.\"\n\n\"Good for you, Nell,\" said her husband, approvingly. \"Come now,\nprofessor, you sit up in the University' Club all Sunday morning and\ndiscuss recondite philosophy with other learned agnostics, tell us what\nis the matter with Mr. Hodder's theology. That is, if it will not shock\ngrandmother too much.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I've got used to being shocked, Phil,\" said Mrs. Waring,\nwith her quiet smile.\n\n\"It's unfair,\" Mr. Bridges protested, \"to ask a prejudiced pagan like me\nto pronounce judgment on an honest parson who is labouring according to\nhis lights.\"\n\n\"Go on, George. You shan't get out of it that way.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said George, \"the trouble is, from the theological point of\nview, that your parson is preaching what Auguste Sabatier would call a\ndiminished and mitigated orthodoxy.\"\n\n\"Great heavens!\" cried Phil. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"It's neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, nor good red herring,\" the\nprofessor declared. \"If Mr. Hodder were cornered he couldn't maintain\nthat he, as a priest, has full power to forgive sins, and yet he won't\nassert that he hasn't. The mediaeval conception of the Church, before\nLuther's day, was consistent, at any rate, if you once grant the\npremises on which it was based.\"\n\n\"What premises?\"\n\n\"That the Almighty had given it a charter, like an insurance company, of\na monopoly of salvation on this portion of the Universe, and agreed\nto keep his hands off. Under this conception, the sale of\nindulgences, masses for the soul, and temporal power are perfectly\nlogical--inevitable. Kings and princes derive their governments from the\nChurch. But if we once begin to doubt the validity of this charter, as\nthe Reformers did, the whole system flies to pieces, like sticking a pin\ninto a soap bubble.\n\n\"That is the reason why--to change the figure--the so-called Protestant\nworld has been gradually sliding down hill ever since the Reformation.\nThe great majority of men are not willing to turn good, to renounce the\nmaterial and sensual rewards under their hands without some definite and\nconcrete guaranty that, if they do so, they are going, to be rewarded\nhereafter. They demand some sort of infallibility. And when we let go\nof the infallibility of the Church, we began to slide toward what looked\nlike a bottomless pit, and we clutched at the infallibility of the\nBible. And now that has begun to roll.\n\n\"What I mean by a mitigated orthodoxy is this: I am far from accusing\nMr. Hodder of insincerity, but he preaches as if every word of the Bible\nwere literally true, and had been dictated by God to the men who held\nthe pen, as if he, as a priest, held some supernatural power that could\ndefinitely be traced, through what is known as the Apostolic Succession,\nback to Peter.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say, George,\" asked Mrs. Waring, with a note of pain\nin her voice, \"that the Apostolic Succession cannot be historically\nproved?\"\n\n\"My dear mother,\" said George, \"I hope you will hold me innocent of\nbeginning this discussion. As a harmless professor of history in our\nrenowned University (of which we think so much that we do not send our\nsons to it) I have been compelled by the children whom you have brought\nup to sit in judgment on the theology of your rector.\"\n\n\"They will leave us nothing!\" she sighed.\n\n\"Nothing, perhaps, that was invented by man to appeal to man's\nsuperstition and weakness. Of the remainder--who can say?\"\n\n\"What,\" asked Mrs. Waring, \"do they say about the Apostolic Succession?\"\n\n\"Mother is as bad as the rest of us,\" said Eleanor.\n\n\"Isn't she, grandfather?\"\n\n\"If I had a house to rent,\" said Mr. Bridges, when the laughter had\nsubsided, \"I shouldn't advertise five bath rooms when there were only\ntwo, or electricity when there was only gas. I should be afraid my\ntenants might find it out, and lose a certain amount of confidence in\nme. But the orthodox churches are running just such a risk to-day, and\nif any person who contemplates entering these churches doesn't examine\nthe premises first, he refrains at his own cost.\n\n\"The situation in the early Christian Church is now a matter of history,\nand he who runs may read. The first churches, like those of Corinth and\nEphesus and Rome, were democracies: no such thing as a priestly line to\ncarry on a hierarchy, an ecclesiastical dynasty, was dreamed of. It may\nbe gathered from the gospels that such an idea was so far from the\nmind of Christ that his mission was to set at naught just such another\nhierarchy, which then existed in Israel. The Apostles were no more\nbishops than was John the Baptist, but preachers who travelled from\nplace to place, like Paul. The congregations, at Rome and elsewhere,\nelected their own 'presbyteri, episcopoi' or overseers. It is, to say\nthe least, doubtful, and it certainly cannot be proved historically,\nthat Peter ever was in Rome.\"\n\n\"The professor ought to have a pulpit of his own,\" said Phil.\n\nThere was a silence. And then Evelyn, who had been eating quantities of\nhothouse grapes, spoke up.\n\n\"So far as I can see, the dilemma in which our generation finds itself\nis this,--we want to know what there is in Christianity that we can\nlay hold of. We should like to believe, but, as George says, all our\neducation contradicts the doctrines that are most insisted upon. We\ndon't know where to turn. We have the choice of going to people\nlike George, who know a great deal and don't believe anything, or to\nclergymen like Mr. Hodder, who demand that we shall violate the reason\nin us which has been so carefully trained.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I think you've put it rather well, Evelyn,\" said Eleanor,\nadmiringly.\n\n\"In spite of personalities,\" added Mr. Bridges.\n\n\"I don't see the use of fussing about it,\" proclaimed Laureston Grey,\nwho was the richest and sprucest of the three sons-in-law. \"Why can't we\nlet well enough alone?\"\n\n\"Because it isn't well enough,\" Evelyn replied. \"I want the real thing\nor nothing. I go to church once a month, to please mother. It doesn't do\nme any good. And I don't see what good it does you and Lucy to go every\nSunday. You never think of it when you're out at dinners and dances\nduring the week. And besides,\" she added, with the arrogance of modern\nyouth, \"you and Lucy are both intellectually lazy.\"\n\n\"I like that from you, Evelyn,\" her sister flared up.\n\n\"You never read anything except the sporting columns and the annual\nrules of tennis and golf and polo.\"\n\n\"Must everything be reduced to terms?\" Mrs. Waring gently lamented. \"Why\ncan't we, as Laury suggests, just continue to trust?\"\n\n\"They are the more fortunate, perhaps, who can, mother,\" George Bridges\nanswered, with more of feeling in his voice than he was wont to show.\n\"Unhappily, truth does not come that way. If Roger Bacon and Galileo\nand Newton and Darwin and Harvey and the others had 'just trusted,' the\nworld's knowledge would still remain as stationary as it was during\nthe thousand-odd years the hierarchy of the Church was supreme, when\ntheology was history, philosophy, and science rolled into one. If God\nhad not meant man to know something of his origin differing from\nthe account in Genesis, he would not have given us Darwin and his\nsuccessors. Practically every great discovery since the Revival we owe\nto men who, by their very desire for truth, were forced into opposition\nto the tremendous power of the Church, which always insisted that\npeople should 'just trust,' and take the mixture of cosmogony and Greek\nphilosophy, tradition and fable, paganism, Judaic sacerdotalism, and\ntemporal power wrongly called spiritual dealt out by this same Church\nas the last word on science, philosophy, history, metaphysics, and\ngovernment.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Eleanor. \"You make me dizzy.\"\n\n\"Nearly all the pioneers to whom we owe our age of comparative\nenlightenment were heretics,\" George persisted. \"And if they could have\nbeen headed off, or burned, most of us would still be living in mud\ncaves at the foot of the cliff on which stood the nobleman's castle; and\nkings would still be kings by divine decree, scientists--if there\nwere any--workers in the black art, and every phenomenon we failed to\nunderstand, a miracle.\"\n\n\"I choose the United States of America,\" ejaculated Evelyn.\n\n\"I gather, George,\" said Phil Goodrich, \"that you don't believe in\nmiracles.\"\n\n\"Miracles are becoming suspiciously fewer and fewer. Once, an eclipse of\nthe sun was enough to throw men on their knees because they thought it\nsupernatural. If they were logical they'd kneel today because it has\nbeen found natural. Only the inexplicable phenomena are miracles; and\nafter a while--if the theologians will only permit us to finish the\njob--there won't be any inexplicable phenomena. Mystery, as I believe\nWilliam James puts it may be called the more-to-be-known.\"\n\n\"In taking that attitude, George, aren't you limiting the power of God?\"\nsaid Mrs. Waring.\n\n\"How does it limit the power of God, mother,\" her son-in-law asked, \"to\ndiscover that he chooses to work by laws? The most suicidal tendency in\nreligious bodies today is their mediaeval insistence on what they are\npleased to call the supernatural. Which is the more marvellous--that God\ncan stop the earth and make the sun appear to stand still, or that he\ncan construct a universe of untold millions of suns with planets and\nsatellites, each moving in its orbit, according to law; a universe\nwherein every atom is true to a sovereign conception? And yet this\nmarvel of marvels--that makes God in the twentieth century infinitely\ngreater than in the sixteenth--would never have been discovered if the\nchampions of theology had had their way.\"\n\nMrs. Waring smiled a little.\n\n\"You are too strong for me, George,\" she said, \"but you mustn't expect\nan old woman to change.\"\n\n\"Mother, dear,\" cried Eleanor, rising and laying her hand on Mrs.\nWaring's cheek, \"we don't want you to change. It's ourselves we wish to\nchange, we wish for a religious faith like yours, only the same teaching\nwhich gave it to you is powerless for us. That's our trouble. We have\nonly to look at you,\" she added, a little wistfully, \"to be sure there\nis something--something vital in Christianity, if we could only get at\nit, something that does not depend upon what we have been led to believe\nis indispensable. George, and men like him, can only show the weakness\nin the old supports. I don't mean that they aren't doing the world a\nservice in revealing errors, but they cannot reconstruct.\"\n\n\"That is the clergyman's business,\" declared Mr. Bridges. \"But he must\nfirst acknowledge that the old supports are worthless.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Phil, \"I like your rector, in spite of his\nanthropomorphism--perhaps, as George would say, because of it. There is\nsomething manly about him that appeals to me.\"\n\n\"There,\" cried Eleanor, triumphantly, \"I've always said Mr. Hodder had a\nspiritual personality. You feel--you feel there is truth shut up inside\nof him which he cannot communicate. I'll tell you who impresses me in\nthat way more strongly than any one else--Mr. Bentley. And he doesn't\ncome to church any more.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bentley,\" said her, mother, \"is a saint. Your father tried to get\nhim to dinner to-day, but he had promised those working girls of his,\nwho live on the upper floors of his house, to dine with them. One of\nthem told me so. Of course he will never speak of his kindnesses.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bentley doesn't bother his head about theology,\" said Sally. \"He\njust lives.\"\n\n\"There's Eldon Parr,\" suggested George Bridges, mentioning the name of\nthe city's famous financier; \"I'm told he relieved Mr. Bentley of his\nproperty some twenty-five years ago. If Mr. Hodder should begin to\npreach the modern heresy which you desire, Mr Parr might object. He's\nvery orthodox, I'm told.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Parr,\" remarked the modern Evelyn, sententiously, \"pays the\nbills, at St. John's. Doesn't he, father?\"\n\n\"I fear he pays a large proportion of them,\" Mr. Waring admitted, in a\nserious tone.\n\n\"In these days,\" said Evelyn, \"the man who pays the bills is entitled to\nhave his religion as he likes it.\"\n\n\"No matter how he got the money to pay them,\" added Phil.\n\n\"That suggests another little hitch in the modern church which will have\nto be straightened out,\" said George Bridges.\n\n\"'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye make clean\nthe outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of\nextortion and excess.'\"\n\n\"Why, George, you of all people quoting the Bible!\" Eleanor exclaimed.\n\n\"And quoting it aptly, too,\" said Phil Goodrich.\n\n\"I'm afraid if we began on the scribes and Pharisees, we shouldn't stop\nwith Mr. Parr,\" Asa Wiring observed, with a touch of sadness.\n\n\"In spite of all they say he has done, I can't help feeling sorry for\nhim,\" said Mrs. Waring. \"He must be so lonely in that huge palace of\nhis beside the Park, his wife dead, and Preston running wild around the\nworld, and Alison no comfort. The idea of a girl leaving her father as\nshe did and going off to New York to become a landscape architect!\"\n\n\"But, mother,\" Evelyn pleaded, \"I can't see why a woman shouldn't lead\nher own life. She only has one, like a man. And generally she doesn't\nget that.\"\n\nMrs. Waring rose.\n\n\"I don't know what we're coming to. I was taught that a woman's place\nwas with her husband and children; or, if she had none, with her family.\nI tried to teach you so, my dear.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Evelyn, \"I'm here yet. I haven't Alison's excuse. Cheer up,\nmother, the world's no worse than it was.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" answered Mrs. Waring.\n\n\"Listen!\" ejaculated Eleanor.\n\nMrs. Waring's face brightened. Sounds of mad revelry came down from the\nfloor above.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. MR. LANGMAID'S MISSION\n\n\nI\n\nLooking back over an extraordinary career, it is interesting to attempt\nto fix the time when a name becomes a talisman, and passes current for\npower. This is peculiarly difficult in the case of Eldon Parr. Like many\nnotable men before him, nobody but Mr. Parr himself suspected his future\ngreatness, and he kept the secret. But if we are to search what is now\nancient history for a turning-point, perhaps we should find it in the\nsudden acquisition by him of the property of Mr. Bentley.\n\nThe transaction was a simple one. Those were the days when gentlemen,\nas matters of courtesy, put their names on other gentlemen's notes;\nand modern financiers, while they might be sorry for Mr. Bentley, would\nprobably be unanimous in the opinion that he was foolish to write on the\nback of Thomas Garrett's. Mr. Parr was then, as now, a business man, and\ncould scarcely be expected to introduce philanthropy into finance. Such\nhad been Mr. Bentley's unfortunate practice. And it had so happened,\na few years before, for the accommodation of some young men of his\nacquaintance that he had invested rather generously in Grantham mining\nstock at twenty-five cents a share, and had promptly forgotten the\ntransaction. To cut a long story short, in addition to Mr. Bentley's\nhouse and other effects, Mr. Parr became the owner of the Grantham\nstock, which not long after went to one hundred dollars. The reader may\ndo the figuring.\n\nWhere was some talk at this time, but many things had happened since.\nFor example, Mr. Parr had given away great sums in charity. And it may\nlikewise be added in his favour that Mr. Bentley was glad to be rid of\nhis fortune. He had said so. He deeded his pew back to St. John's, and\nprotesting to his friends that he was not unhappy, he disappeared from\nthe sight of all save a few. The rising waters of Prosperity closed over\nhim. But Eliza Preston, now Mrs. Parr, was one of those who were never\nto behold him again,--in this world, at least.\n\nShe was another conspicuous triumph in that career we are depicting.\nGradual indeed had been the ascent from the sweeping out of a store to\nthe marrying of a Preston, but none the less sure inevitable. For many\nyears after this event, Eldon Parr lived modestly in what was known as a\n\"stone-front\" house in Ransome Street, set well above the sidewalk, with\na long flight of yellow stone steps leading to it; steps scrubbed with\nSapoho twice a week by a negro in rubber boots. There was a stable with\na tarred roof in the rear, to be discerned beyond the conventional side\nlawn that was broken into by the bay window of the dining-room.\nThere, in that house, his two children were born: there, within those\ninartistic walls, Eliza Preston lived a life that will remain a closed\nbook forever. What she thought, what she dreamed, if anything, will\nnever be revealed. She did not, at least, have neurasthenia, and for all\nthe world knew, she may have loved her exemplary and successful\nhusband, with whom her life was as regular as the Strasburg clock.\nShe breakfasted at eight and dined at seven; she heard her children's\nlessons and read them Bible stories; and at half past ten every Sunday\nmorning, rain or shine, walked with them and her husband to the cars on\nTower Street to attend service at St. John's, for Mr. Parr had scruples\nin those days about using the carriage on the Sabbath.\n\nShe did not live, alas, to enjoy for long the Medicean magnificence\nof the mansion facing the Park, to be a companion moon in the greater\norbit. Eldon Part's grief was real, and the beautiful English window in\nthe south transept of the church bears witness to it. And yet it cannot\nbe said that he sought solace in religion, so apparently steeped in it\nhad he always been. It was destiny that he should take his place on the\nvestry; destiny, indeed, that he should ultimately become the vestry\nas well as the first layman of the diocese; unobtrusively, as he had\naccomplished everything else in life, in spite of Prestons and Warings,\nAtterburys, Goodriches, and Gores. And he was wont to leave his weighty\nbusiness affairs to shift for themselves while he attended the diocesan\nand general conventions of his Church.\n\nHe gave judiciously, as becomes one who holds a fortune in trust, yet\ngenerously, always permitting others to help, until St. John's was a\nvery gem of finished beauty. And, as the Rothschilds and the Fuggera\nmade money for grateful kings and popes, so in a democratic age, Eldon\nParr became the benefactor of an adulatory public. The university, the\nlibrary, the hospitals, and the parks of his chosen city bear witness.\n\n\n\nII\n\nFor forty years, Dr. Gilman had been the rector of St. John's. One\nSunday morning, he preached his not unfamiliar sermon on the text, \"For\nnow we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face,\" and when\nthe next Sunday dawned he was in his grave in Winterbourne Cemetery,\nsincerely mourned within the parish and without. In the nature of mortal\nthings, his death was to be expected: no less real was the crisis to be\nfaced At the vestry meeting that followed, the problem was tersely set\nforth by Eldon Parr, his frock coat tightly buttoned about his chest,\nhis glasses in his hand.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"we have to fulfil a grave responsibility to the\nparish, to the city, and to God. The matter of choosing a rector to-day,\nwhen clergymen are meddling with all sorts of affairs which do not\nconcern them, is not so simple as it was twenty years ago. We have, at\nSt. John's, always been orthodox and dignified, and I take it to be the\nsense of this vestry that we remain so. I conceive it our duty to find\na man who is neither too old nor too young, who will preach the faith\nas we received it, who is not sensational, and who does not mistake\nsocialism for Christianity.\"\n\nBy force of habit, undoubtedly, Mr. Parr glanced at Nelson Langmaid as\nhe sat down. Innumerable had been the meetings of financial boards at\nwhich Mr. Parr had glanced at Langmaid, who had never failed to\nrespond. He was that sine qua non of modern affairs, a corporation\nlawyer,--although he resembled a big and genial professor of\nScandinavian extraction. He wore round, tortoise-shell spectacles, he\nhad a high, dome-like forehead, and an ample light brown beard which he\nstroked from time to time. It is probable that he did not believe in the\nimmortality of the soul.\n\nHis eyes twinkled as he rose.\n\n\"I don't pretend to be versed in theology, gentlemen, as you know,\" he\nsaid, and the entire vestry, even Mr. Parr, smiled. For vestries, in\nspite of black coats and the gravity of demeanour which first citizens\nare apt to possess, are human after all. \"Mr. Parr has stated, I\nbelieve; the requirements, and I agree with him that it is not an easy\norder to fill. You want a parson who will stick to his last, who will\nnot try experiments, who is not too high or too low or too broad or too\nnarrow, who has intellect without too much initiative, who can deliver\na good sermon to those who can appreciate one, and yet will not get the\nchurch uncomfortably full of strangers and run you out of your pews. In\nshort, you want a level-headed clergyman about thirty-five years old who\nwill mind his own business.\"\n\nThe smiles on the faces of the vestry deepened. The ability to put a\nmatter thus humorously was a part of Nelson Langmaid's power with men\nand juries.\n\n\"I venture to add another qualification,\" he continued, \"and that is\nvirility. We don't want a bandbox rector. Well, I happen to have in mind\na young man who errs somewhat on the other side, and who looks a little\nlike a cliff profile I once saw on Lake George of George Washington\nor an Indian chief, who stands about six feet two. He's a bachelor--if\nthat's a drawback. But I am not at all sure he can be induced to leave\nhis present parish, where he has been for ten years.\"\n\n\"I am,\" announced Wallis Plimpton, with his hands in his pockets,\n\"provided the right man tackles him.\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\nNelson Langmaid's most notable achievement, before he accomplished\nthe greater one of getting a new rector for St. John's, had been to\nconstruct the \"water-tight box\" whereby the Consolidated Tractions\nCompany had become a law-proof possibility. But his was an esoteric\nreputation,--the greater fame had been Eldon Parr's. Men's minds had\nbeen dazzled by the breadth of the conception of scooping all the\nstreet-car lines of the city, long and short, into one big basket, as it\nwere; and when the stock had been listed in New York, butcher and baker,\nclerk and proprietor, widow and maid, brought out their hoardings; the\ngreat project was discussed in clubs, cafes, and department stores,\nand by citizens hanging on the straps of the very cars that were to be\nconsolidated--golden word! Very little appeared about Nelson Langmaid,\nwho was philosophically content. But to Mr. Parr, who was known to\ndislike publicity, were devoted pages in the Sunday newspapers, with\nphotographs of the imposing front of his house in Park Street, his altar\nand window in St. John's, the Parr building, and even of his private\ncar, Antonia.\n\nLater on, another kind of publicity, had come. The wind had whistled\nfor a time, but it turned out to be only a squall. The Consolidated\nTractions Company had made the voyage for which she had been\nconstructed, and thus had fulfilled her usefulness; and the cleverest\nof the rats who had mistaken her for a permanent home scurried ashore\nbefore she was broken up.\n\nAll of which is merely in the nature of a commentary on Mr. Langmaid's\ngenius. His reputation for judgment--which by some is deemed the highest\nof human qualities--was impaired; and a man who in his time had selected\npresidents of banks and trust companies could certainly be trusted to\nchoose a parson--particularly if the chief requirements were not of a\nspiritual nature...\n\nA week later he boarded an east-bound limited train, armed with plenary\npowers.\n\nHis destination was the hill town where he had spent the first fifteen\nyears of his life, amid the most striking of New England landscapes, and\nthe sight of the steep yet delicately pastoral slopes never failed to\nthrill him as the train toiled up the wide valley to Bremerton. The\nvision of these had remained with him during the years of his toil in\nthe growing Western city, and embodied from the first homesick days an\nideal to which he hoped sometime permanently to return. But he never\nhad. His family had shown a perversity of taste in preferring the sea,\nand he had perforce been content with a visit of a month or so every\nother summer, accompanied usually by his daughter, Helen. On such\noccasions, he stayed with his sister, Mrs. Whitely.\n\nThe Whitely mills were significant of the new Bremerton, now neither\nvillage nor city, but partaking of the characteristics of both. French\nCanadian might be heard on the main square as well as Yankee; and that\nrevolutionary vehicle, the automobile, had inspired there a great brick\nedifice with a banner called the Bremerton House. Enterprising Italians\nhad monopolized the corners with fruit stores, and plate glass and\nasphalt were in evidence. But the hills looked down unchanged, and in\nthe cool, maple-shaded streets, though dotted with modern residences,\nwere the same demure colonial houses he had known in boyhood.\n\nHe was met at the station by his sister, a large, matronly woman who\ninvariably set the world whizzing backward for Langmaid; so completely\ndid she typify the contentment, the point of view of an age gone by.\nFor life presented no more complicated problems to the middle-aged Mrs.\nWhitely than it had to Alice Langmaid.\n\n\"I know what you've come for, Nelson,\" she said reproachfully, when she\ngreeted him at the station. \"Dr. Gilman's dead, and you want our Mr.\nHodder. I feel it in my bones. Well, you can't get him. He's had ever so\nmany calls, but he won't leave Bremerton.\"\n\nShe knew perfectly well, however, that Nelson would get him, although\nher brother characteristically did not at once acknowledge his mission.\nAlice Whitely had vivid memories of a childhood when he had never failed\nto get what he wanted; a trait of his of which, although it had before\nnow caused her much discomfort, she was secretly inordinately proud. She\nwas, therefore, later in the day not greatly surprised to find herself\nsupplying her brother with arguments. Much as they admired and loved\nMr. Hodder, they had always realized that he could not remain buried in\nBremerton. His talents demanded a wider field.\n\n\"Talents!\" exclaimed Langmaid, \"I didn't know he had any.\"\n\n\"Oh, Nelson, how can you say such a thing, when you came to get him!\"\nexclaimed his sister.\n\n\"I recommended him because I thought he had none,\" Langmaid declared.\n\n\"He'll be a bishop some day--every one says so,\" said Mrs. Whitely,\nindignantly.\n\n\"That reassures me,\" said her brother.\n\n\"I can't see why they sent you--you hardly ever go to church,\" she\ncried. \"I don't mind telling you, Nelson, that the confidence men place\nin you is absurd.\"\n\n\"You've said that before,\" he replied. \"I agree with you. I'm not going\non my judgment--but on yours and Gerald's, because I know that you\nwouldn't put up with anything that wasn't strictly all-wool orthodox.\"\n\n\"I think you're irreverent,\" said his sister, \"and it's a shame that the\ncanons permit such persons to sit on the vestry....\"\n\n\"Gerald,\" asked Nelson Langmaid of his brother-in-law that night, after\nhis sister and the girls had gone to bed, \"are you sure that this young\nman's orthodox?\"\n\n\"He's been here for over ten years, ever since he left the seminary, and\nhe's never done or said anything radical yet,\" replied the mill owner of\nBremerton. \"If you don't want him, we'd be delighted to have him stay.\nWe're not forcing him on you, you know. What the deuce has got into you?\nYou've talked to him for two hours, and you've sat looking at him at the\ndinner table for another two. I thought you were a judge of men.\"\n\nNelson Langmaid sat silent.\n\n\"I'm only urging Hodder to go for his own good,\" Mr. Whitely continued.\n\"I can take you to dozens of people to-morrow morning who worship\nhim,--people of all sorts; the cashier in the bank, men in the mills,\nthe hotel clerk, my private stenographer--he's built up that little\nchurch from nothing at all. And you may write the Bishop, if you wish.\"\n\n\"How has he built up the church?\" Langmaid demanded\n\n\"How? How does any clergyman buildup a church\n\n\"I don't know,\" Langmaid confessed. \"It strikes me as quite a tour de\nforce in these days. Does he manage to arouse enthusiasm for orthodox\nChristianity?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Gerard Whitely, \"I think the service appeals. We've made it\nas beautiful as possible. And then Mr. Hodder goes to see these people\nand sits up with them, and they tell him their troubles. He's reformed\none or two rather bad cases. I suppose it's the man's personality.\"\n\nAh! Langmaid exclaimed, \"now you're talking!\"\n\n\"I can't see what you're driving at,\" confessed his brother-in-law.\n\"You're too deep for me, Nelson.\"\n\nIf the truth be told, Langmaid himself did not quits see. On behalf\nof the vestry, he offered next day to Mr. Hodder the rectorship of St.\nJohn's and that offer was taken under consideration; but there was in\nthe lawyer's mind no doubt of the acceptance, which, in the course of a\nfortnight after he had returned to the West, followed.\n\nBy no means a negligible element in Nelson Langmaid's professional\nsuccess had been his possession of what may called a sixth sense,\nand more than once, on his missions of trust, he had listened to its\nadmonitory promptings.\n\nAt times he thought he recognized these in his conversation with the\nReverend John Hodder at Bremerton,--especially in that last interview in\nthe pleasant little study of the rectory overlooking Bremerton Lake. But\nthe promptings were faint, and Langmaid out of his medium. He was not\nchoosing the head of a trust company.\n\nHe himself felt the pull of the young clergyman's personality, and\ninstinctively strove to resist it: and was more than ever struck by Mr.\nHodder's resemblance to the cliff sculpture of which he had spoken at\nthe vestry meeting.\n\nHe was rough-hewn indeed, with gray-green eyes, and hair the color of\ngolden sand: it would not stay brushed. It was this hair that hinted\nmost strongly of individualism, that was by no means orthodox. Langmaid\nfelt an incongruity, but he was fascinated; and he had discovered on the\nrector's shelves evidences of the taste for classical authors that he\nhimself possessed. Thus fate played with him, and the two men ranged\nfrom Euripides to Horace, from Horace to Dante and Gibbon. And when\nHodder got up to fetch this or that edition, he seemed to tower over the\nlawyer, who was a big man himself.\n\nThen they discussed business, Langmaid describing the parish, the\npeople, the peculiar situation in St. John's caused by Dr. Gilman's\ndeath, while Hodder listened. He was not talkative; he made no promises;\nhis reserve on occasions was even a little disconcerting; and it\nappealed to the lawyer from Hodder as a man, but somehow not as a\nclergyman. Nor did the rector volunteer any evidences of the soundness\nof his theological or political principles.\n\nHe gave Langmaid the impression--though without apparent egotism--that\nby accepting the call he would be conferring a favour on St. John's; and\nthis was when he spoke with real feeling of the ties that bound him to\nBremerton. Langmaid felt a certain deprecation of the fact that he was\nnot a communicant.\n\nFor the rest, if Mr. Hodder were disposed to take himself and his\nprofession seriously, he was by no means lacking in an appreciation of\nLangmaid's humour....\n\nThe tempering of the lawyer's elation as he returned homeward to report\nto Mr. Parr and the vestry may be best expressed by his own exclamation,\nwhich he made to himself:\n\n\"I wonder what that fellow would do if he ever got started!\" A parson\nwas, after all, a parson, and he had done his best.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nA high, oozing note of the brakes, and the heavy train came to a\nstop. Hodder looked out of the window of the sleeper to read the sign\n'Marcion' against the yellow brick of the station set down in the\nprairie mud, and flanked by a long row of dun-colored freight cars\nbacked up to a factory.\n\nThe factory was flimsy, somewhat resembling a vast greenhouse with its\nmultitudinous windows, and bore the name of a firm whose offices were in\nthe city to which he was bound.\n\n\"We 'most in now, sah,\" the negro porter volunteered. \"You kin see the\nsmoke yondah.\"\n\nHodder's mood found a figure in this portentous sign whereby the city's\npresence was betrayed to travellers from afar,--the huge pall seemed an\nemblem of the weight of the city's sorrows; or again, a cloud of her own\nmaking which shut her in from the sight of heaven. Absorbed in the mad\ncontest for life, for money and pleasure and power she felt no need to\nlift her eyes beyond the level of her material endeavours.\n\nHe, John Hodder, was to live under that cloud, to labour under it. The\nmission on which he was bound, like the prophets of old, was somehow to\ngain the ears of this self-absorbed population, to strike the fear of\nthe eternal into their souls, to convince them that there was Something\nabove and beyond that smoke which they ignored to their own peril.\n\nYet the task, at this nearer view, took on proportions overwhelming--so\ndense was that curtain at which he gazed. And to-day the very skies\nabove it were leaden, as though Nature herself had turned atheist. In\nspite of the vigour with which he was endowed, in spite of the belief\nin his own soul, doubts assailed him of his ability to cope with this\nproblem of the modern Nineveh--at the very moment when he was about to\nrealize his matured ambition of a great city parish.\n\nLeaning back on the cushioned seat, as the train started again, he\nreviewed the years at Bremerton, his first and only parish. Hitherto (to\nhis surprise, since he had been prepared for trials) he had found the\nreligious life a primrose path. Clouds had indeed rested on Bremerton's\ncrests, but beneficent clouds, always scattered by the sun. And there,\namid the dazzling snows, he had on occasions walked with God.\n\nHis success, modest though it were, had been too simple. He had\nloved the people, and they him, and the pang of homesickness he now\nexperienced was the intensest sorrow he had known since he had been\namong them. Yes, Bremerton had been for him (he realized now that he had\nleft it) as near an approach to Arcadia as this life permits, and the\nvery mountains by which it was encircled had seemed effectively to shut\nout those monster problems which had set the modern world outside to\nseething. Gerald Whitely's thousand operatives had never struck; the\nNew York newspapers, the magazines that discussed with vivid animus\nthe corporation-political problems in other states, had found Bremerton\ninterested, but unmoved; and Mrs. Whitely, who was a trustee of the\nlibrary, wasted her energy in deploring the recent volumes on economics,\nsociology, philosophy, and religion that were placed on the shelves. If\nBremerton read them--and a portion of Bremerton did--no difference\nwas apparent in the attendance at Hodder's church. The Woman's Club\ndiscussed them strenuously, but made no attempt to put their doctrines\ninto practice.\n\nHodder himself had but glanced at a few of them, and to do him justice\nthis abstention had not had its root in cowardice. His life was\nfull--his religion \"worked.\" And the conditions with which these books\ndealt simply did not exist for him. The fact that there were other\nchurches in the town less successful than his own (one or two, indeed,\nvirtually starving) he had found it simple to account for in that their\ndenominations had abandoned the true conception of the Church, and were\nlogically degenerating into atrophy. What better proof of the barrenness\nof these modern philosophical and religious books did he need than\nthe spectacle of other ministers--who tarried awhile on starvation\nsalaries--reading them and preaching from them?\n\nHe, John Hodder, had held fast to the essential efficacy of the word of\nGod as propounded in past ages by the Fathers. It is only fair to\nadd that he did so without pride or bigotry, and with a sense of\nthankfulness at the simplicity of the solution (ancient, in truth!)\nwhich, apparently by special grace, had been vouchsafed him. And to it\nhe attributed the flourishing condition in which he had left the Church\nof the Ascension at Bremerton.\n\n\"We'll never get another rector like you,\" Alice Whitely had exclaimed,\nwith tears in her eyes, as she bade him good-by. And he had rebuked her.\nOthers had spoken in a similar strain, and it is a certain tribute\nto his character to record that the underlying hint had been lost on\nHodder. His efficacy, he insisted, lay in the Word.\n\nHodder looked at his watch, only to be reminded poignantly of the chief\ncause of his heaviness of spirit, for it represented concretely the\naffections of those whom he had left behind; brought before him vividly\nthe purple haze of the Bremerton valley, and the garden party, in the\nample Whitely grounds, which was their tribute to him. And he beheld,\nmoving from the sunlight to shadow, the figure of Rachel Ogden. She\nmight have been with him now, speeding by his side into the larger life!\n\nIn his loneliness, he seemed to be gazing into reproachful eyes. Nothing\nhad passed between them. It, was he who had held back, a fact that in\nthe retrospect caused him some amazement. For, if wifehood were to be\nregarded as a profession, Rachel Ogden had every qualification. And Mrs.\nWhitely's skilful suggestions had on occasions almost brought him to\nbelieve in the reality of the mirage,--never quite.\n\nOrthodox though he were, there had been times when his humour had borne\nhim upward toward higher truths, and he had once remarked that promising\nto love forever was like promising to become President of the United\nStates.\n\nOne might achieve it, but it was independent of the will. Hodder's\nideals--if he had only known--transcended the rubric. His feeling for\nRachel Ogden had not been lacking in tenderness, and yet he had recoiled\nfrom marriage merely for the sake of getting a wife, albeit one with\neasy qualification. He shrank instinctively from the humdrum, and sought\nthe heights, stormy though these might prove. As yet he had not analyzed\nthis craving.\n\nThis he did know--for he had long ago torn from his demon the draperies\nof disguise--that women were his great temptation. Ordination had not\ndestroyed it, and even during those peaceful years at Bremerton he had\nbeen forced to maintain a watchful guard. He had a power over women,\nand they over him, that threatened to lead him constantly into wayside\npaths, and often he wondered what those who listened to him from the\npulpit would think if they guessed that at times, he struggled with\nsuggestion even now. Yet, with his hatred of compromises, he had scorned\nmarriage.\n\nThe yoke of Augustine! The caldron of unholy loves! Even now, as he sat\nin the train, his mind took its own flight backward into that remoter\npast that was still a part of him: to secret acts of his college days\nthe thought of which made him shudder; yes, and to riots and revels. In\nyouth, his had been one of those boiling, contagious spirits that carry\nwith them, irresistibly, tamer companions. He had been a leader in\nintermittent raids into forbidden spheres; a leader also in certain more\ndecorous pursuits--if athletics may be so accounted; yet he had capable\nof long periods of self-control, for a cause. Through it all a spark had\nmiraculously been kept alive....\n\nPopularity followed him from the small New England college to the\nHarvard Law School. He had been soberer there, marked as a pleader, and\nat last the day arrived when he was summoned by a great New York lawyer\nto discuss his future. Sunday intervened. Obeying a wayward impulse, he\nhad gone to one of the metropolitan churches to hear a preacher renowned\nfor his influence over men. There is, indeed, much that is stirring to\nthe imagination in the spectacle of a mass of human beings thronging\ninto a great church, pouring up the aisles, crowding the galleries,\njoining with full voices in the hymns. What drew them? He himself was\nsinging words familiar since childhood, and suddenly they were fraught\nwith a startling meaning!\n\n          \"Fill me, radiancy divine,\n          Scatter all my unbelief!\"\n\nVisions of the Crusades rose before him, of a friar arousing France,\nof a Maid of Orleans; of masses of soiled, war-worn, sin-worn humanity\ngroping towards the light. Even after all these ages, the belief, the\nhope would not down.\n\nOutside, a dismal February rain was falling, a rain to wet the soul.\nThe reek of damp clothes pervaded the gallery where he sat surrounded by\nclerks and shop girls, and he pictured to himself the dreary rooms from\nwhich they had emerged, drawn by the mysterious fire on that altar. Was\nit a will-o'-the-wisp? Below him, in the pews, were the rich. Did they,\ntoo, need warmth?\n\nThen came the sermon, \"I will arise and go to my father.\"\n\nAfter the service, far into the afternoon, he had walked the wet streets\nheedless of his direction, in an exaltation that he had felt before, but\nnever with such intensity. It seemed as though he had always wished to\npreach, and marvelled that the perception had not come to him sooner.\nIf the man to whom he had listened could pour the light into the dark\ncorners of other men's souls, he, John Hodder, felt the same hot spark\nwithin him,--despite the dark corners of his own!\n\nAt dusk he came to himself, hungry, tired, and wet, in what proved to be\nthe outskirts of Harlem. He could see the place now: the lonely, wooden\nhouses, the ramshackle saloon, the ugly, yellow gleam from the street\nlamps in a line along the glistening pavement; beside him, a towering\nhill of granite with a real estate sign, \"This lot for sale.\" And he had\nstood staring at it, thinking of the rock that would have to be cut away\nbefore a man could build there,--and so read his own parable.\n\nHow much rock would have to be cut away, how much patient chipping\nbefore the edifice of which he had been dreaming could be reared! Could\nhe ever do it? Once removed, he would be building on rock. But could\nhe remove it?... To help revive a faith, a dying faith, in a material\nage,--that indeed were a mission for any man! He found his way to an\nelevated train, and as it swept along stared unseeing at the people who\npushed and jostled him. Still under the spell, he reached his room and\nwrote to the lawyer thanking him, but saying that he had reconsidered\ncoming to New York. It was not until he had posted the letter, and was\non his way back to Cambridge that he fully realized he had made the\ndecision of his life.\n\nMisgivings, many of them, had come in the months that followed,\nmisgivings and struggles, mocking queries. Would it last? There was the\nincredulity and amazement of nearest friends, who tried to dissuade him\nfrom so extraordinary a proceeding. Nobody, they said, ever became\na parson in these days; nobody, at least, with his ability. He\nwas throwing himself away. Ethics had taken the place of religion;\nintelligent men didn't go to church. And within him went on an endless\ndebate. Public opinion made some allowance for frailties in other\nprofessions; in the ministry, none: he would be committing himself to be\ngood the rest of his life, and that seemed too vast an undertaking for\nany human.\n\nThe chief horror that haunted him was not failure,--for oddly enough he\nnever seriously distrusted his power, it was disaster. Would God give\nhim the strength to fight his demon? If he were to gain the heights,\nonly to stumble in the sight of all men, to stumble and fall.\n\nSeeming echoes of the hideous mockery of it rang in his ears: where\nis the God that this man proclaimed? he saw the newspaper headlines,\nlistened in imagination to cynical comments, beheld his name trailed\nthrough the soiled places of the cities, the shuttlecock of men and\nwomen. \"To him that overcometh, to him will I give of the hidden\nmanna, and I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name\nwritten, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it.\" Might he ever\nwin that new name, eat of the hidden manna of a hidden power, become the\npossessor of the morning star?\n\nUnless there be in the background a mother, no portrait of a man is\ncomplete. She explains him, is his complement. Through good mothers are\nmen conceived of God: and with God they sit, forever yearning, forever\nreaching out, helpless except for him: with him, they have put a man\ninto the world. Thus, into the Supreme Canvas, came the Virgin.\n\nJohn Hodder's mother was a widow, and to her, in the white, gabled house\nwhich had sheltered stern ancestors, he travelled in the June following\nhis experience. Standing under the fan-light of the elm-shaded doorway,\nshe seemed a vision of the peace wherein are mingled joy and sorrow,\nfaith and tears! A tall, quiet woman, who had learned the lesson\nof mothers,--how to wait and how to pray, how to be silent with a\nclamouring heart.\n\nShe had lived to see him established at Bremerton, to be with him there\nawhile....\n\nHe awoke from these memories to gaze down through the criss-cross of a\ntrestle to the twisted, turbid waters of the river far below. Beyond\nwas the city. The train skirted for a while the hideous, soot-stained\nwarehouses that faced the water, plunged into a lane between humming\nfactories and clothes-draped tenements, and at last glided into\nsemi-darkness under the high, reverberating roof of the Union Station.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE PRIMROSE PATH\n\n\nI\n\nNelson Langmaid's extraordinary judgment appeared once more to be\nvindicated.\n\nThere had been, indeed, a critical, anxious moment, emphasized by the\nagitation of bright feminine plumes and the shifting of masculine backs\ninto the corners of the pews. None got so far as to define to themselves\nwhy there should be an apparent incompatibility between ruggedness and\northodoxy--but there were some who hoped and more who feared. Luther\nhad been orthodox once, Savonarola also: in appearance neither was more\ncanonical than the new rector.\n\nHis congregation, for the most part, were not analytical. But they\nfelt a certain anomaly in virility proclaiming tradition. It took them\nseveral Sundays to get accustomed to it.\n\nTo those who had been used for more than a quarter of a century to\nseeing old Dr. Gilman's gentle face under the familiar and faded dove of\nthe sounding-board, to the deliberation of his walk, and the hesitation\nof his manner, the first impression of the Reverend John Hodder was\nsomewhat startling. They felt that there should be a leisurely element\nin religion. He moved across the chancel with incredible swiftness, his\nwhite surplice flowing like the draperies of a moving Victory, wasted\nno time with the pulpit lights, announced his text in a strong and\npenetrating, but by no means unpleasing voice, and began to speak with\nthe certainty of authority.\n\nHere, in an age when a new rector had, ceased to be an all-absorbing\ntopic in social life, was a new and somewhat exhilarating experience.\nAnd it may be privately confessed that there were some who sat in St.\nJohn's during those first weeks of his incumbency who would indignantly\nhave repudiated the accusation that they were not good churchmen and\nchurchwomen, and who nevertheless had queer sensations in listening\nto ancient doctrines set forth with Emersonian conviction. Some were\ncourageous enough to ask themselves, in the light of this forceful\npresentation, whether they really did believe them as firmly as they\nsupposed they had.\n\nDear old Dr. Gilman had been milder--much milder as the years gained\nupon him. And latterly, when he had preached, his voice had sounded like\nthe unavailing protest of one left far behind, who called out faintly\nwith unheeded warnings. They had loved him: but the modern world was\na busy world, and Dr. Gilman did not understand it. This man was\ndifferent. Here was what the Church taught, he said, and they might\nslight it at their peril!\n\nIt is one thing to believe one's self orthodox, and quite another to\nhave that orthodoxy so definitely defined as to be compelled, whether or\nno, to look it squarely in the face and own or disown it. Some indeed,\nlike Gordon Atterbury, stood the test; responded to the clarion call for\nwhich they had been longing. But little Everett Constable, who also sat\non the vestry, was a trifle uncomfortable in being reminded that absence\nfrom the Communion Table was perilous, although he would have been the\nlast to deny the efficacy of the Sacrament.\n\nThe new rector was plainly not a man who might be accused of policy in\npandering to the tastes of a wealthy and conservative flock. But if,\nin the series of sermons which lasted from his advent until well after\nChristmas, he had deliberately consulted their prejudices, he could not\nhave done better. It is true that he went beyond the majority of them,\nbut into a region which they regarded as preeminently safe,--a region\nthe soil of which was traditional. To wit: St. Paul had left to the\nworld a consistent theology. Historical research was ignored rather\nthan condemned. And it might reasonably have been gathered from these\ndiscourses that the main proofs of Christ's divinity lay in his Virgin\nBirth, his miracles, and in the fact that his body had risen from the\ngrave, had been seen by many, and even touched. Hence unbelief had no\nexcuse. By divine commission there were bishops, priests, and deacons in\nthe new hierarchy, and it was through the Apostolic Succession that he,\ntheir rector, derived his sacerdotal powers. There were, no doubt,\nmany obscure passages in the Scripture, but men's minds were finite; a\ncatholic acceptance was imperative, and the evils of the present day--a\nsufficiently sweeping statement--were wholly due to deplorable lapses\nfrom such acceptance. The Apostolic teaching must be preserved, since\nit transcended all modern wanderings after truth. Hell, though not\ndefinitely defined in terms of flames, was no less a state of torture\n(future, by implication) of which fire was but a faint symbol. And\nhe gave them clearly to understand that an unbaptized person ran no\ninconsiderable risk. He did not declare unqualifiedly that the Church\nalone had the power to save, but such was the inference.\n\n\n\nII\n\nIt was entirely fitting, no doubt, when the felicitations of certain of\nthe older parishioners on his initial sermon were over, that Mr.\nHodder should be carried westward to lunch with the first layman of the\ndiocese. But Mr. Parr, as became a person of his responsibility, had\nbeen more moderate in his comment. For he had seen, in his day, many\nmen whose promise had been unfulfilled. Tightly buttoned, silk\nhatted, upright, he sat in the corner of his limousine, the tasselled\nspeaking-tube in his hand, from time to time cautioning his chauffeur.\n\n\"Carefully!\" he cried. \"I've told you not to drive so fast in this part\nof town. I've never got used to automobiles,\" he remarked to Hodder,\n\"and I formerly went to church in the street-cars, but the distances\nhave grown so great--and I have occasionally been annoyed in them.\"\n\nHodder was not given to trite acquiescence. His homely composure belied\nthe alertness of his faculties; he was striving to adapt himself to the\nsudden broadening and quickening of the stream of his life, and he felt\na certain excitement--although he did not betray it--in the presence of\nthe financier. Much as he resented the thought, it was impossible\nfor him not to realize that the man's pleasure and displeasure were\nimportant; for, since his arrival, he had had delicate reminders of this\nfrom many sources. Recurrently, it had caused him a vague uneasiness,\nhinted at a problem new to him. He was jealous of the dignity of the\nChurch, and he seemed already to have detected in Mr. Parr's manner\na subtle note of patronage. Nor could Hodder's years of provincialism\npermit him to forget that this man with whom he was about to enter into\npersonal relations was a capitalist of national importance.\n\nThe neighbourhood they traversed was characteristic of our rapidly\nexpanding American cities. There were rows of dwelling houses, once\nultra-respectable, now slatternly, and lawns gone grey; some of these\nhouses had been remodelled into third-rate shops, or thrown together to\nmake manufacturing establishments: saloons occupied all the favourable\ncorners. Flaming posters on vacant lots announced, pictorially, dubious\nattractions at the theatres. It was a wonderful Indian summer day, the\nsunlight soft and melting; and the smoke which continually harassed this\ndistrict had lifted a little, as though in deference to the Sabbath.\n\nHodder read the sign on a lamp post, Dalton Street. The name clung in\nhis memory.\n\n\"We thought, some twenty years ago, of moving the church westward,\" said\nMr. Parr, \"but finally agreed to remain where we were.\"\n\nThe rector had a conviction on this point, and did not hesitate to state\nit without waiting to be enlightened as to the banker's views.\n\n\"It would seem to me a wise decision,\" he said, looking out of the\nwindow, and wholly absorbed in the contemplation of the evidences of\nmisery and vice, \"with this poverty at the very doors of the church.\"\n\nSomething in his voice impelled Eldon Parr to shoot a glance at his\nprofile.\n\n\"Poverty is inevitable, Mr. Hodder,\" he declared. \"The weak always\nsink.\"\n\nHodder's reply, whatever it might have been, was prevented by the sudden\nand unceremonious flight of both occupants toward the ceiling of the\nlimousine, caused by a deep pit in the asphalt.\n\n\"What are you doing, Gratton?\" Mr. Parr called sharply through the tube.\n\nPresently, the lawns began to grow brighter, the houses more cheerful,\nand the shops were left behind. They crossed the third great transverse\nartery of the city (not so long ago, Mr. Parr remarked, a quagmire), now\nlined by hotels and stores with alluring displays in plate glass windows\nand entered a wide boulevard that stretched westward straight to the\ngreat Park. This boulevard the financier recalled as a country road\nof clay. It was bordered by a vivid strip, of green; a row of tall\nand graceful lamp posts, like sentinels, marked its course; while the\ndwellings, set far back on either side, were for the most part large and\npretentious, betraying in their many tentative styles of architecture\nthe reaching out of a commercial nation after beauty. Some, indeed, were\nsimple of line and restful to the trained eye.\n\nThey came to the wide entrance of the Park, so wisely preserved as a\nbreathing place for future generations. A slight haze had gathered over\nthe rolling forests to the westward; but this haze was not smoke. Here,\nin this enchanting region, the autumn sunlight was undiluted gold,\nthe lawns, emerald, and the red gravel around the statesman's statue\nglistening. The automobile quickly swung into a street that skirted the\nPark,--if street it might be called, for it was more like a generous\nprivate driveway,--flanked on the right by fences of ornamental ironwork\nand high shrubbery that concealed the fore yards of dominating private\nresidences which might: without great exaggeration, have been called\npalaces.\n\n\"That's Ferguson's house,\" volunteered Mr. Parr, indicating a marble\nedifice with countless windows. \"He's one of your vestrymen, you know.\nFerguson's Department Store.\" The banker's eyes twinkled a little for\nthe first time. \"You'll probably find it convenient. Most people do.\nClever business man, Ferguson.\"\n\nBut the rector was finding difficulty in tabulating his impressions.\n\nThey turned in between two posts of a gateway toward a huge house of\nrough granite. And Hodder wondered whether, in the swift onward roll\nof things, the time would come when this, too, would have been deemed\nephemeral. With its massive walls and heavy, red-tiled roof that sloped\nsteeply to many points, it seemed firmly planted for ages to come. It\nwas surrounded, yet not hemmed in, by trees of a considerable age. His\nhost explained that these had belonged to the original farm of which all\nthis Park Street property had made a part.\n\nThey alighted under a porte-cochere with a glass roof.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Mr. Parr, as the doors swung open and he led the way\ninto the house, \"I'm sorry I can't give you a more cheerful welcome, but\nmy son and daughter, for their own reasons, see fit to live elsewhere.\"\n\nHodder's quick ear detected in the tone another cadence, and he glanced\nat Eldon Parr with a new interest....\n\nPresently they stood, face to face, across a table reduced to its\nsmallest proportions, in the tempered light of a vast dining-room,\nan apartment that seemed to symbolize the fortress-like properties of\nwealth. The odd thought struck the clergyman that this man had made his\nown Tower of London, had built with his own hands the prison in which he\nwas to end his days. The carved oaken ceiling, lofty though it was, had\nthe effect of pressing downward, the heavy furniture matched the heavy\nwalls, and even the silent, quick-moving servants had a watchful air.\n\nMr. Parr bowed his head while Hodder asked grace. They sat down.\n\nThe constraint which had characterized their conversation continued,\nyet there was a subtle change in the attitude of the clergyman. The\nfinancier felt this, though it could not be said that Hodder appeared\nmore at his ease: his previous silences had been by no means awkward.\nEldon Parr liked self-contained men. But his perceptions were as keen as\nNelson Langmaid's, and like Langmaid, he had gradually become conscious\nof a certain baffling personality in the new rector of St. John's. From\ntime to time he was aware of the grey-green eyes curiously fixed on\nhim, and at a loss to account for their expression. He had no thought\nof reading in it an element of pity. Yet pity was nevertheless in the\nrector's heart, and its advent was emancipating him from the limitations\nof provincial inexperience.\n\nSuddenly, the financier launched forth on a series of shrewd and\nsearching questions about Bremerton, its church, its people, its\nindustries, and social conditions. All of which Hodder answered to his\napparent satisfaction.\n\nCoffee was brought. Hodder pushed back his chair, crossed his knees,\nand sat perfectly still regarding his host, his body suggesting a repose\nthat did not interfere with his perceptive faculties.\n\n\"You don't smoke, Mr. Hodder?\"\n\nThe rector smiled and shook his head. Mr. Parr selected a diminutive,\nyellow cigar and held it up.\n\n\"This,\" he said, \"has been the extent of my indulgence for twenty years.\nThey are made for me in Cuba.\"\n\nHodder smiled again, but said nothing.\n\n\"I have had a letter from your former bishop, speaking of you in the\nhighest terms,\" he observed.\n\n\"The bishop is very kind.\"\n\nMr. Parr cleared his throat.\n\n\"I am considerably older than you,\" he went on, \"and I have the future\nof St. John's very much at heart, Mr. Hodder. I trust you will remember\nthis and make allowances for it as I talk to you.\n\n\"I need not remind you that you have a grave responsibility on your\nshoulders for so young a man, and that St. John's is the oldest parish\nin the diocese.\"\n\n\"I think I realize it, Mr. Parr,\" said Hodder, gravely. \"It was only the\nopportunity of a larger work here that induced me to leave Bremerton.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" agreed the banker. \"The parish, I believe, is in good\nrunning order--I do not think you will see the necessity for\nmany--ahem--changes. But we sadly needed an executive head. And, if I\nmay say so, Mr. Hodder, you strike me as a man of that type, who might\nhave made a success in a business career.\"\n\nThe rector smiled again.\n\n\"I am sure you could pay me no higher compliment,\" he answered.\n\nFor an instant Eldon Parr, as he stared at the clergyman, tightened his\nlips,--lips that seemed peculiarly formed for compression. Then they\nrelaxed into what resembled a smile. If it were one, the other returned\nit.\n\n\"Seriously,\" Mr. Parr declared, \"it does me good in these days to hear,\nfrom a young man, such sound doctrine as you preach. I am not one of\nthose who believe in making concessions to agnostics and atheists. You\nwere entirely right, in my opinion, when you said that we who belong\nto the Church--and of course you meant all orthodox Christians--should\nstand by our faith as delivered by the saints. Of course,\" he added,\nsmiling, \"I should not insist upon the sublapsarian view of election\nwhich I was taught in the Presbyterian Church as a boy.\"\n\nHodder laughed, but did not interrupt.\n\n\"On the other hand,\" Mr. Parr continued, \"I have little patience with\nclergymen who would make religion attractive. What does it amount\nto--luring people into the churches on one pretext or another,\nsugar-coating the pill? Salvation is a more serious matter. Let the\nchurches stick to their own. We have at St. John's a God-fearing,\nconservative congregation, which does not believe in taking liberties\nwith sound and established doctrine. And I may confess to you, Mr.\nHodder, that we were naturally not a little anxious about Dr. Gilman's\nsuccessor, that we should not get, in spite of every precaution, a man\ntinged with the new and dangerous ideas so prevalent, I regret to say,\namong the clergy. I need scarcely add that our anxieties have been set\nat rest.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Hodder, \"must be taken as a compliment to the dean of the\ntheological seminary from which I graduated.\"\n\nThe financier stared again. But he decided that Mr. Hodder had not meant\nto imply that he, Mr. Parr, was attempting to supersede the dean. The\nanswer had been modest.\n\n\"I take it for granted that you and I and all sensible men are happily.\nagreed that the Church should remain where she is. Let the people come\nto her. She should be, if I may so express it, the sheet anchor of\nsociety, our bulwark against socialism, in spite of socialists who call\nthemselves ministers of God. The Church has lost ground--why? Because\nshe has given ground. The sanctity of private property is being menaced,\ndemagogues are crying out from the house-tops and inciting people\nagainst the men who have made this country what it is, who have risked\ntheir fortunes and their careers for the present prosperity. We have no\nlonger any right, it seems, to employ whom we will in our factories and\nour railroads; we are not allowed to regulate our rates, although\nthe risks were all ours. Even the women are meddling,--they are not\nsatisfied to stay in the homes, where they belong. You agree with me?\"\n\n\"As to the women,\" said the rector, \"I have to acknowledge that I have\nnever had any experience with the militant type of which you speak.\"\n\n\"I pray God you may never have,\" exclaimed Mr. Parr, with more feeling\nthan he had yet shown.\n\n\"Woman's suffrage, and what is called feminism in general, have never\npenetrated to Bremerton. Indeed, I must confess to have been wholly out\nof touch with the problems to which you refer, although of course I have\nbeen aware of their existence.\"\n\n\"You will meet them here,\" said the banker, significantly.\n\n\"Yes,\" the rector replied thoughtfully, \"I can see that. I know that the\nproblems here will be more complicated, more modern,--more difficult.\nAnd I thoroughly agree with you that their ultimate solution is\ndependent on Christianity. If I did not believe,--in spite of the\nevident fact which you point out of the Church's lost ground, that her\nfuture will be greater than her past, I should not be a clergyman.\"\n\nThe quiet but firm note of faith was, not lost on the financier, and\nyet was not he quite sure what was to be made of it? He had a faint and\nfleeting sense of disquiet, which registered and was gone.\n\n\"I hope so,\" he said vaguely, referring perhaps to the resuscitation of\nwhich the rector spoke. He drummed on the table. \"I'll go so far as to\nsay that I, too, think that the structure can be repaired. And I believe\nit is the duty of the men of influence--all men of influence--to assist.\nI don't say that men of influence are not factors in the Church to-day,\nbut I do say that they are not using the intelligence in this task which\nthey bring to bear, for instance, on their business.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the clergy might help,\" Hodder suggested, and added more\nseriously, \"I think that many of them are honestly trying to do so.\"\n\n\"No doubt of it. Why is it,\" Mr. Parr continued reflectively, \"that\nministers as a whole are by no means the men they were? You will pardon\nmy frankness. When I was a boy, the minister was looked up to as an\nintellectual and moral force to be reckoned with. I have heard it\nassigned, as one reason, that in the last thirty years other careers\nhave opened up, careers that have proved much more attractive to young\nmen of ability.\"\n\n\"Business careers?\" inquired the rector.\n\n\"Precisely!\"\n\n\"In other words,\" said Hodder, with his curious smile, \"the ministry\ngets the men who can't succeed at anything else.\"\n\n\"Well, that's putting it rather strong,\" answered Mr. Parr, actually\nreddening a little. \"But come now, most young men would rather be a\nrailroad president than a bishop,--wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"Most young men would,\" agreed Hodder, quickly, \"but they are not the\nyoung men who ought to be bishops, you'll admit that.\"\n\nThe financier, be it recorded to his credit, did not lack appreciation\nof this thrust, and, for the first time, he laughed with something\nresembling heartiness. This laughter, in which Hodder joined, seemed\nsuddenly to put them on a new footing--a little surprising to both.\n\n\"Come,\" said the financier, rising, \"I'm sure you like pictures, and\nLangmaid tells me you have a fancy for first editions. Would you care to\ngo to the gallery?\"\n\n\"By all means,\" the rector assented.\n\nTheir footsteps, as they crossed the hardwood floors, echoed in the\nempty house. After pausing to contemplate a Millet on the stair landing,\nthey came at last to the huge, silent gallery, where the soft but\nadequate light fell upon many masterpieces, ancient and modern. And it\nwas here, while gazing at the Corots and Bonheurs, Lawrences, Romneys,\nCopleys, and Halses, that Hodder's sense of their owner's isolation grew\nalmost overpowering Once, glancing over his shoulder at Mr. Parr, he\nsurprised in his eyes an expression almost of pain.\n\n\"These pictures must give you great pleasure,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh,\" replied the banker, in a queer voice, \"I'm always glad when any\none appreciates them. I never come in here alone.\"\n\nHodder did not reply. They passed along to an upstairs sitting-room,\nwhich must, Hodder thought, be directly over the dining-room. Between\nits windows was a case containing priceless curios.\n\n\"My wife liked this room,\" Mr. Parr explained, as he opened the case.\nWhen they had inspected it, the rector stood for a moment gazing out at\na formal garden at the back of the house. The stalks of late flowers lay\nwithering, but here and there the leaves were still vivid, and clusters\nof crimson berries gleamed in the autumn sunshine. A pergola ran down\nthe middle, and through denuded grape-vines he caught a glimpse, at the\nfar end, of sculptured figures and curving marble benches surrounding a\npool.\n\n\"What a wonderful spot!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"My daughter Alison designed it.\"\n\n\"She must have great talent,\" said the rector.\n\n\"She's gone to New York and become a landscape architect,\" said his\nhost with a perceptible dryness. \"Women in these days are apt to be\neverything except what the Lord intended them to be.\"\n\nThey went downstairs, and Hodder took his leave, although he felt an odd\nreluctance to go. Mr. Parr rang the bell.\n\n\"I'll send you down in the motor,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd like the exercise of walking,\" said the rector. \"I begin to miss it\nalready, in the city.\"\n\n\"You look as if you had taken a great deal of it,\" Mr. Parr declared,\nfollowing him to the door. \"I hope you'll drop in often. Even if I'm not\nhere, the gallery and the library are at your disposal.\"\n\nTheir eyes met.\n\n\"You're very good,\" Hodder replied, and went down the steps and through\nthe open doorway.\n\nLost in reflection, he walked eastward with long and rapid strides,\nstriving to reduce to order in his mind the impressions the visit\nhad given him, only to find them too complex, too complicated by\nunlooked-for emotions. Before its occurrence, he had, in spite of an\ninherent common sense, felt a little uneasiness over the prospective\nmeeting with the financier. And Nelson Langmaid had hinted,\ngood-naturedly, that it was his, Hodder's, business, to get on good\nterms with Mr. Parr--otherwise the rectorship of St. John's might not\nprove abed of roses. Although the lawyer had spoken with delicacy, he\nhad once more misjudged his man--the result being to put Hodder on his\nguard. He had been the more determined not to cater to the banker.\n\nThe outcome of it all had been that the rector left him with a sense of\nhaving crossed barriers forbidden to other men, and not understanding\nhow he had crossed them. Whether this incipient intimacy were ominous\nor propitious, whether there were involved in it a germ (engendered by\na radical difference of temperament) capable of developing into future\nconflict, he could not now decide. If Eldon Parr were Procrustes\nhe, Hodder, had fitted the bed, and to say the least, this was\nextraordinary, if not a little disquieting. Now and again his thoughts\nreverted to the garden, and to the woman who had made it. Why had she\ndeserted?\n\nAt length, after he had been walking for nearly an hour, he halted and\nlooked about him. He was within a few blocks of the church, a little to\none side of Tower Street, the main east and west highway of the city,\nin the midst of that district in which Mr. Parr had made the remark that\npoverty was inevitable. Slovenly and depressing at noonday, it seemed\nnow frankly to have flung off its mask. Dusk was gathering, and with it\na smoke-stained fog that lent a sickly tinge to the lights. Women slunk\nby him: the saloons, apparently closed, and many houses with veiled\nwindows betrayed secret and sinister gleams. In the midst of a block\nrose a tall, pretentious though cheaply constructed building with the\nwords \"Hotel Albert\" in flaming electric letters above an archway. Once\nmore his eye read Dalton Street on a lamp....\n\nHodder resumed his walk more slowly, and in a few minutes reached his\nrooms in the parish house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. SOME RIDDLES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\n\nI Although he found the complications of a modern city parish somewhat\nbewildering, the new rector entered into his duties that winter with\napostolic zeal. He was aware of limitations and anomalies, but his faith\nwas boundless, his energy the subject of good-natured comment by his\nvestry and parishioners, whose pressing invitations' to dinners he\nwas often compelled to refuse. There was in John Hodder something\nindefinable that inflamed curiosity and left it unsatisfied.\n\nHis excuse for attending these dinners, which indeed were relaxing and\nenjoyable, he found in the obvious duty of getting to know the most\nimportant members of his congregation. But invariably he came away from\nthem with an inner sense of having been baffled in this object. With\na few exceptions, these modern people seemed to have no time for\nfriendship in the real meaning of the word, no desire to carry a\nrelationship beyond a certain point. Although he was their spiritual\npastor, he knew less about most of them at the end of the winter than\ntheir butlers and their maids.\n\nThey were kind, they were delightful, they were interested in him--he\noccasionally thought--as a somewhat anachronistic phenomenon. They\npetted, respected him, and deferred to him. He represented to them an\nelement in life they recognized, and which had its proper niche. What\nthey failed to acknowledge was his point of view--and this he was wise\nenough not to press at dinner tables and in drawing-rooms--that religion\nshould have the penetrability of ether; that it should be the absorbent\nof life. He did not have to commit the banality of reminding them of\nthis conviction of his at their own tables; he had sufficient humour and\npenetration to credit them with knowing it. Nay, he went farther in his\nunsuspected analysis, and perceived that these beliefs made one of his\nchief attractions for them. It was pleasant to have authority in a black\ncoat at one's board; to defer, if not to bend to it. The traditions of\nfashion demanded a clergyman in the milieu, and the more tenaciously he\nclung to his prerogatives, the better they liked it.\n\nAlthough they were conscious of a certain pressure, which they gently\nresisted, they did not divine that the radiating and rugged young man\ncherished serious designs upon them. He did not expect to transform the\nworld in a day, especially the modern world. He was biding his time,\nawaiting individual opportunities.\n\nThey talked to him of the parish work, congratulated him on the vigour\nwith which he had attacked it, and often declared themselves jealous of\nit because it claimed too much of him. Dear Dr. Gilman, they said,\nhad had neither the strength nor the perception of 'modern needs; and\nMcCrae, the first assistant clergyman, while a good man, was a plodder\nand lacking in imagination. They talked sympathetically about the\nproblems of the poor. And some of them--particularly Mrs. Wallis\nPlimpton were inclined to think Hodder's replies a trifle noncommittal.\nThe trouble, although he did not tell them so, was that he himself had\nby no means solved the problem. And he felt a certain reluctance to\ndiscuss the riddle of poverty over champagne and porcelain.\n\nMrs. Plimpton and Mrs. Constable, Mrs. Ferguson, Mrs. Langmaid, Mrs.\nLarrabbee, Mrs. Atterbury, Mrs. Grey, and many other ladies and their\ndaughters were honorary members of his guilds and societies, and found\ntime in their busy lives to decorate the church, adorn the altar, care\nfor the vestments, and visit the parish house. Some of them did more:\nMrs. Larrabbee, for instance, when she was in town, often graced the\ngirls' classes with her presence, which was a little disquieting to\nthe daughters of immigrants: a little disquieting, too, to John Hodder.\nDuring the three years that had elapsed since Mr. Larrabbee's death, she\nhad, with characteristic grace and ease, taken up philanthropy; become,\nin particular, the feminine patron saint of Galt House, non-sectarian, a\nrescue home for the erring of her sex.\n\nThere were, too, in this higher realm of wealth in and out of which\nHodder plunged, women like Mrs. Constable (much older than Mrs.\nLarrabbee) with whom philanthropy and what is known as \"church work\"\nhad become second nature in a well-ordered life, and who attended\nwith praiseworthy regularity the meetings of charitable boards and\ncommittees, not infrequently taking an interest in individuals in Mr.\nHodder's classes. With her, on occasions, he did discuss such matters,\nonly to come away from her with his bewilderment deepened.\n\nIt was only natural that he should have his moods of depression. But the\nrecurrent flow of his energy swept them away. Cynicism had no place in\nhis militant Christianity, and yet there were times when he wondered\nwhether these good people really wished achievements from their rector.\nThey had the air of saying \"Bravo!\" and then of turning away. And he did\nnot conceal from himself that he was really doing nothing but labour.\nThe distances were great; and between his dinner parties, classes,\nservices, and visits, he was forced to sit far into the night preparing\nhis sermons, when his brain was not so keen as it might have been.\nIndeed--and this thought was cynical and out of character--he asked\nhimself on one occasion whether his principal achievement so far had\nnot consisted in getting on unusual terms with Eldon Parr. They were\nnot lacking who thought so, and who did not hesitate to imply it. They\nevidently regarded his growing intimacy with the banker with approval,\nas in some sort a supreme qualification for a rector of St. John's, and\na proof of unusual abilities. There could be no question, for instance,\nthat he had advanced perceptibly in the estimation of the wife of\nanother of his vestrymen, Mrs. Wallis Plimpton.\n\nThe daughter of Thurston Gore, with all her astuteness and real estate,\nwas of a naivete in regard to spiritual matters that Hodder had grown\nto recognize as impermeable. In an evening gown, with a string of large\npearls testing on her firm and glowing neck, she appeared a concrete\nrefutation of the notion of rebirth, the triumph of an unconscious\nphilosophy of material common-sense. However, in parish house affairs,\nHodder had found her practical brain of no slight assistance.\n\n\"I think it quite wonderful,\" she remarked, on the occasion at which he\nwas the guest of honour in what was still called the new Gore mansion,\n\"that you have come to know Mr. Parr so well in such a short time. How\ndid you do it, Mr. Hodder? Of course Wallis knows him, and sees a great\ndeal of him in business matters. He relies on Wallis. But they tell me\nyou have grown more intimate with him than any one has been since Alison\nleft him.\"\n\nThere is, in Proverbs or Ecclesiastes, a formula for answering people\nin accordance with their point of view. The rector modestly disclaimed\nintimacy. And he curbed his curiosity about Alison for the reason that\nhe preferred to hear her story from another source.\n\n\"Oh, but you are intimate!\" Mrs. Plimpton protested. \"Everybody says\nso--that Mr. Parr sends for you all the time. What is he like when he's\nalone, and relaxed? Is he ever relaxed?\" The lady had a habit of\nnot waiting for answers to her questions. \"Do you know, it stirs my\nimagination tremendously when I think of all the power that man has.\nI suppose you know he has become one of a very small group of men who\ncontrol this country, and naturally he has been cruelly maligned. All he\nhas to do is to say a word to his secretary, and he can make men or ruin\nthem. It isn't that he does ruin them--I don't mean that. He uses his\nwealth, Wallis says, to maintain the prosperity of the nation! He feels\nhis trusteeship. And he is so generous! He has given a great deal to the\nchurch, and now,\" she added, \"I am sure he will give more.\"\n\nHodder was appalled. He felt helpless before the weight of this\nonslaught.\n\n\"I dare say he will continue to assist, as he has in the past,\" he\nmanaged to say.\n\n\"Of course it's your disinterestedness,\" she proclaimed, examining him\nfrankly. \"He feels that you don't want anything. You always strike me as\nso splendidly impartial, Mr. Hodder.\"\n\nFortunately, he was spared an answer. Mr. Plimpton, who was wont to\napply his gifts as a toastmaster to his own festivals, hailed him from\nthe other end of the table.\n\nAnd Nelson Langmaid, who had fallen into the habit of dropping into\nHodder's rooms in the parish house on his way uptown for a chat about\nbooks, had been struck by the rector's friendship with the banker.\n\n\"I don't understand how you managed it, Hodder, in such a short time,\"\nhe declared. \"Mr. Parr's a difficult man. In all these years, I've been\ncloser to him than any one else, and I don't know him today half as well\nas you do.\"\n\n\"I didn't manage it,\" said Hodder, briefly.\n\n\"Well,\" replied the lawyer, quizzically, \"you needn't eat me up. I'm\nsure you didn't do it on purpose. If you had,--to use a Hibernian\nphrase,--you never would have done it. I've seen it tried before. To\ntell you the truth, after I'd come back from Bremerton, that was the one\nthing I was afraid of--that you mightn't get along with him.\"\n\nHodder himself was at a loss to account for the relationship. It\ntroubled him vaguely, for Mr. Parr was the aggressor; and often at dusk,\nwhen Hodder was working under his study lamp, the telephone would ring,\nand on taking down the receiver he would hear the banker's voice. \"I'm\nalone to-night, Mr. Hodder. Will you come and have dinner with me?\"\n\nHad he known it, this was a different method of communication than that\nwhich the financier usually employed, one which should have flattered\nhim. If Wallis Plimpton, for instance, had received such a personal\nmessage, the fact would not have remained unknown the next day at his\nclub. Sometimes it was impossible for Hodder to go, and he said so; but\nhe always went when he could.\n\nThe unwonted note of appeal (which the telephone seemed somehow to\nenhance) in Mr. Parr's voice, never failed to find a response in the\nrector's heart, and he would ponder over it as he walked across to Tower\nStreet to take the electric car for the six-mile trip westward.\n\nThis note of appeal he inevitably contrasted with the dry,\nmatter-of-fact reserve of his greeting at the great house, which loomed\nall the greater in the darkness. Unsatisfactory, from many points of\nview, as these evenings were, they served to keep whetted Hodder's\ncuriosity as to the life of this extraordinary man. All of its vaster\nsignificance for the world, its tremendous machinery, was out of his\nsight.\n\nMr. Parr seemed indeed to regard the rest of his fellow-creatures with\nthe suspicion at which Langmaid had hinted, to look askance at the\namenities people tentatively held out to him. And the private\nwatchman whom Hodder sometimes met in the darkness, and who invariably\nscrutinized pedestrians on Park Street, seemed symbolic, of this\nattitude. On rare occasions, when in town, the financier dined out,\nlimiting himself to a few houses.\n\nOnce in a long while he attended what are known as banquets, such as\nthose given by the Chamber of Commerce, though he generally refused\nto speak. Hodder, through Mr. Parr's intervention, had gone to one of\nthese, ably and breezily presided over by the versatile Mr. Plimpton.\n\nHodder felt not only curiosity and sympathy, but a vexing sense of the\nfruitlessness of his visits to Park Street. Mr. Parr seemed to like to\nhave him there. And the very fact that the conversation rarely took any\nvital turn oddly contributed to the increasing permanence of the lien.\nTo venture on any topic relating to the affairs of the day were merely\nto summon forth the banker's dogmatism, and Hodder's own opinions on\nsuch matters were now in a strange and unsettled state. Mr. Parr liked\nbest to talk of his treasures, and of the circumstances during his trips\nabroad that had led to their acquirement. Once the banker had asked him\nabout parish house matters.\n\n\"I'm told you're working very hard--stirring up McCrae. He needs it.\"\n\n\"I'm only trying to study the situation,\" Hodder replied. \"I don't think\nyou quite do justice to McCrae,\" he added; \"he's very faithful, and\nseems to understand those people thoroughly.\"\n\nMr. Parr smiled.\n\n\"And what conclusions have you come to? If you think the system should\nbe enlarged and reorganized I am willing at any time to go over it with\nyou, with a view to making an additional contribution. Personally, while\nI have sympathy for the unfortunate, I'm not at all sure that much of\nthe energy and money put into the institutional work of churches isn't\nwasted.\"\n\n\"I haven't come to any conclusions--yet,\" said the rector, with a touch\nof sadness. \"Perhaps I demand too much--expect too much.\"\n\nThe financier, deep in his leather chair under the shaded light,\nthe tips of his fingers pressed together, regarded the younger man\nthoughtfully, but the smile lingered in his eyes.\n\n\"I told you you would meet problems,\" he said.\n\n\n\nII\n\nHodder's cosmos might have been compared, indeed, to that set forth in\nthe Ptolemaic theory of the ancients. Like a cleverly carved Chinese\nobject of ivory in the banker's collection, it was a system of spheres,\ntouching, concentric, yet separate. In an outer space swung Mr. Parr;\nthen came the scarcely less rarefied atmosphere of the Constables and\nAtterburys, Fergusons, Plimptons, Langmaids, Prestons, Larrabbees,\nGreys, and Gores, and then a smaller sphere which claims but a passing\nmention. There were, in the congregation of St. John's, a few people of\nmoderate means whose houses or apartments the rector visited; people to\nwhom modern life was increasingly perplexing.\n\nIn these ranks were certain maiden ladies and widows who found in church\nwork an outlet to an otherwise circumscribed existence. Hodder met them\ncontinually in his daily rounds. There were people like the Bradleys,\nwho rented half a pew and never missed a Sunday; Mr. Bradley, an elderly\nman whose children had scattered, was an upper clerk in one of Mr.\nParr's trust companies: there were bachelors and young women, married\nor single, who taught in the Sunday school or helped with the night\nclasses. For the most part, all of these mentioned above belonged to an\nelement that once had had a comfortable and well-recognized place in the\ncommunity, yet had somehow been displaced. Many of them were connected\nby blood with more fortunate parishioners, but economic pressure had\nscattered them throughout new neighbourhoods and suburbs. Tradition\nstill bound them to St. John's.\n\nWith no fixed orbit, the rector cut at random through all of these\nstrata, and into a fourth. Not very far into it, for this apparently\nwent down to limitless depths, the very contemplation of which made him\ndizzy. The parish house seemed to float precariously on its surface.\n\nOwing partly to the old-fashioned ideas of Dr. Gilman, and partly to the\nconservatism of its vestry, the institutionalism of St. John's was by\nno means up to date. No settlement house, with day nurseries, was\nmaintained in the slums. The parish house, built in the early nineties,\nhad its gymnasium hall and class and reading rooms, but was not what in\nthese rapidly moving times would be called modern. Presiding over its\nactivities, and seconded by a pale, but earnest young man recently\nordained, was Hodder's first assistant, the Reverend Mr. McCrae.\n\nMcCrae was another puzzle. He was fifty and gaunt, with a wide flat\nforehead and thinning, grey hair, and wore steel spectacles. He had a\nnumerous family. His speech, of which he was sparing, bore strong traces\nof a Caledonian accent. And this, with the addition of the fact that he\nwas painstaking and methodical in his duties, and that his sermons were\northodox in the sense that they were extremely non-committal, was all\nthat Hodder knew about him for many months. He never doubted, however,\nthe man's sincerity and loyalty.\n\nBut McCrae had a peculiar effect on him, and as time went on, his\nconviction deepened that his assistant was watching him. The fact that\nthis tacit criticism did not seem unkindly did not greatly alleviate\nthe impatience that he felt from time to time. He had formed a higher\nestimate of McCrae's abilities than that generally prevailing throughout\nthe parish; and in spite of, perhaps because of his attitude, was\ndrawn toward the man. This attitude, as Hodder analyzed it from the\nexpressions he occasionally surprised on his assistant's face, was one\nof tolerance and experience, contemplating, with a faint amusement and\na certain regret, the wasteful expenditure of youthful vitality. Yet\nit involved more. McCrae looked as if he knew--knew many things that he\ndeemed it necessary for the new rector to find out by experience.\n\nBut he was a difficult man to talk to.\n\nIf the truth be told, the more Hodder became absorbed in these\nactivities of the parish house, the greater grew his perplexity, the\nmore acute his feeling of incompleteness; or rather, his sense that the\nprinciple was somehow fundamentally at fault. Out of the waters of\nthe proletariat they fished, assiduously and benignly, but at random,\nstrange specimens! brought them, as it were, blinking to the light, and\nheld them by sheer struggling. And sometimes, when they slipped away,\ndived after them. The young curate, Mr. Tompkinson, for the most part\ndid the diving; or, in scriptural language, the searching after the lost\nsheep.\n\nThe results accomplished seemed indeed, as Mr. Parr had remarked,\nstrangely disproportionate to the efforts, for they laboured abundantly.\nThe Italian mothers appeared stolidly appreciative of the altruism of\nMiss Ramsay, who taught the kindergarten, in taking their charges off\ntheir hands for three hours of a morning, and the same might be said of\nthe Jews and Germans and Russians. The newsboys enjoyed the gymnasium\nand reading-rooms: some of them were drafted into the choir, yet\nthe singing of Te Deums failed somehow to accomplish the miracle of\nregeneration. The boys, as a rule, were happier, no doubt; the new\nenvironments not wholly without results. But the rector was an idealist.\n\nHe strove hard to become their friend, and that of the men; to win their\nconfidence, and with a considerable measure of success. On more than one\noccasion he threw aside his clerical coat and put on boxing-gloves, and\nhe gave a series of lectures, with lantern slides, collected during\nthe six months he had once spent in Europe. The Irish-Americans and the\nGermans were the readiest to respond, and these were for the most part\nyoung workingmen and youths by no means destitute. When they were out of\na place, he would often run across them in the reading-room or sitting\namong the lockers beside the gymnasium, and they would rise and talk to\nhim cordially and even familiarly about their affairs. They liked and\ntrusted him--on a tacit condition. There was a boundary he might not\ncross. And the existence of that boundary did not seem to trouble\nMcCrae.\n\nOne night as he stood with his assistant in the hall after the men had\ngone, Hodder could contain himself no longer.\n\n\"Look here, McCrae,\" he broke out, \"these men never come to church--or\nonly a very few of them.\"\n\n\"No more they do,\" McCrae agreed.\n\n\"Why don't they?\"\n\n\"Ye've asked them, perhaps.\"\n\n\"I've spoken to one or two of them,\" admitted the rector.\n\n\"And what do they tell you?\"\n\nHodder smiled.\n\n\"They don't tell me anything. They dodge.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said McCrae.\n\n\"We're not making Christians of them,\" said Hodder, beginning to walk up\nand down. \"Why is it?\"\n\n\"It's a big question.\"\n\n\"It is a big question. It's the question of all questions, it seems to\nme. The function of the Church, in my opinion, is to make Christians.\"\n\n\"Try to teach them religion,\" said McCrae--he almost pronounced it\nreleegion--\"and see what happens. Ye'll have no classes at all. They\nonly come, the best of them, because ye let them alone that way, and\nthey get a little decency and society help. It's somewhat to keep them\nout of the dance-halls and saloons maybe.\"\n\n\"It's not enough,\" the rector asserted. \"You've had a great deal of\nexperience with them. And I want to know why, in your view, more of them\ndon't come into the Church.\"\n\n\"Would ye put Jimmy Flanagan and Otto Bauer and Tony Baldassaro in Mr.\nParr's pew?\" McCrae inquired, with a slight flavour of irony that was\nnot ill-natured. \"Or perhaps Mrs. Larrabbee would make room for them?\"\n\n\"I've considered that, of course,\" replied Hodder, thoughtfully, though\nhe was a little surprised that McCrae should have mentioned it. \"You\nthink their reasons are social, then,--that they feel the gap. I feel it\nmyself most strongly. And yet none of these men are Socialists. If they\nwere, they wouldn't come here to the parish house.\"\n\n\"They're not Socialists,\" agreed McCrae.\n\n\"But there is room in the back and sides of the church, and there is the\nearly service and the Sunday night service, when the pews are free. Why\ndon't they come to these?\"\n\n\"Religion doesn't appeal to them.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Ye've asked me a riddle. All I know is that the minute ye begin to\npreach, off they go and never come back.\"\n\nHodder, with unconscious fixity, looked into his assistant's honest\nface. He had an exasperating notion that McCrae might have said more, if\nhe would.\n\n\"Haven't you a theory?\"\n\n\"Try yourself,\" said McCrae. His manner was abrupt, yet oddly enough,\nnot ungracious.\n\n\"Don't think I'm criticizing,\" said the rector, quickly.\n\n\"I know well ye're not.\"\n\n\"I've been trying to learn. It seems to me that we are only\naccomplishing half our task, and I know that St. John's is not unique\nin this respect. I've been talking to Andrews, of Trinity, about their\npoor.\"\n\n\"Does he give you a remedy?\"\n\n\"No,\" Hodder said. \"He can't see any more than I can why Christianity\ndoesn't appeal any longer. The fathers and mothers of these people went\nto church, in the old country and in this. Of course he sees, as you and\nI do, that society has settled into layers, and that the layers won't\nmix. And he seems to agree with me that there is a good deal of energy\nexerted for a comparatively small return.\"\n\n\"I understand that's what Mr. Parr says.\"\n\nThese references to Mr. Parr disturbed Hodder. He had sometimes\nwondered, when he had been compelled to speak about his visits to the\nfinancier, how McCrae regarded them. He was sure that McCrae did regard\nthem.\n\n\"Mr. Parr is willing to be even more generous than he has been,\" Hodder\nsaid. \"The point is, whether it's wise to enlarge our scope on the\npresent plan. What do you think?\"\n\n\"Ye can reach more,\" McCrae spoke without enthusiasm.\n\n\"What's the use of reaching them, only to touch them? In addition to\nbeing helped materially and socially, and kept away from the dance-halls\nand saloons, they ought to be fired by the Gospels, to be remade. They\nshould be going out into the highways and byways to bring others into\nthe church.\"\n\nThe Scotchman's face changed a little. For an instant his eyes lighted\nup, whether in sympathy or commiseration or both, Hodder could not tell.\n\n\"I'm with ye, Mr. Hodder, if ye'll show me the way. But oughtn't we to\nbegin at both ends?\"\n\n\"At both ends?\" Hodder repeated.\n\n\"Surely. With the people in the pews? Oughtn't we to be firing them,\ntoo?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the rector. \"You're right.\"\n\nHe turned away, to feel McCrae's hand on his sleeve.\n\n\"Maybe it will come, Mr. Hodder,\" he said. \"There's no telling when the\nlight will strike in.\"\n\nIt was the nearest to optimism he had ever known his assistant to\napproach.\n\n\"McCrae,\" he asked, \"have you ever tried to do anything with Dalton\nStreet?\"\n\n\"Dalton Street?\"\n\nThe real McCrae, whom he had seemed to see emerging, retired abruptly,\npresenting his former baffling and noncommittal exterior.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hodder forced himself to go on, and it came to him that he had\nrepeated virtually the same words to Mr. Parr, \"it is at our very doors,\na continual reproach. There is real poverty in those rooming houses, and\nI have never seen vice so defiant and shameless.\"\n\n\"It's a shifty place, that,\" McCrae replied. \"They're in it one day and\ngone the next, a sort of catch-basin for all the rubbish of the city.\nI can recall when decent people lived there, and now it's all light\nhousekeeping and dives and what not.\"\n\n\"But that doesn't relieve us of responsibility,\" Hodder observed.\n\n\"I'm not denying it. I think ye'll find there's very little to get hold\nof.\"\n\nOnce more, he had the air of stopping short, of being able to say more.\nHodder refrained from pressing him.\n\nDalton Street continued to haunt him. And often at nightfall, as he\nhurried back to his bright rooms in the parish house from some of the\nmany errands that absorbed his time, he had a feeling of self-accusation\nas he avoided women wearily treading the pavements, or girls and\nchildren plodding homeward through the wet, wintry streets. Some glanced\nat him with heavy eyes, others passed sullenly, with bent heads. At such\nmoments his sense of helplessness was overpowering. He could not follow\nthem to the dreary dwellings where they lodged.\n\nEldon Parr had said that poverty was inevitable.\n\n\n\n\nVolume 2.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE RECTOR HAS MORE FOOD FOR THOUGHT\n\n\nI\n\nSunday after Sunday Hodder looked upon the same picture, the winter\nlight filtering through emblazoned windows, falling athwart stone\npillars, and staining with rich colours the marble of the centre aisle.\nThe organ rolled out hymns and anthems, the voices of the white robed\nchoir echoed among the arches. And Hodder's eye, sweeping over the\ndecorous congregation, grew to recognize certain landmarks: Eldon\nParr, rigid at one end of his empty pew; little Everett Constable,\ncomfortably, but always pompously settled at one end of his, his\nwhite-haired and distinguished-looking wife at the other. The space\nbetween them had once been filled by their children. There was Mr.\nFerguson, who occasionally stroked his black whiskers with a prodigious\nsolemnity; Mrs. Ferguson, resplendent and always a little warm,\nand their daughter Nan, dainty and appealing, her eyes uplifted and\nquestioning.\n\nThe Plimptons, with their rubicund and aggressively healthy offspring,\nwere always in evidence. And there was Mrs. Larrabbee. What between\nwealth and youth, independence and initiative, a widowhood now emerged\nfrom a mourning unexceptionable, an elegance so unobtrusive as to border\non mystery, she never failed to agitate any atmosphere she entered,\neven that of prayer. From time to time, Hodder himself was uncomfortably\naware of her presence, and he read in her upturned face an interest\nwhich, by a little stretch of the imagination, might have been deemed\npersonal....\n\nAnother was Gordon Atterbury, still known as \"young Gordon,\" though\nhis father was dead, and he was in the vestry. He was unmarried and\nforty-five, and Mrs. Larrabbee had said he reminded her of a shrivelling\nseed set aside from a once fruitful crop. He wore, invariably, checked\ntrousers and a black cutaway coat, eyeglasses that fell off when he\nsquinted, and were saved from destruction by a gold chain. No wedding or\nfuneral was complete without him. And one morning, as he joined Mr. Parr\nand the other gentlemen who responded to the appeal, \"Let your light\nso shine before men,\" a strange, ironical question entered the rector's\nmind--was Gordon Atterbury the logical product of those doctrines which\nhe, Hodder, preached with such feeling and conviction?\n\nNone, at least, was so fervent a defender of the faith, so punctilious\nin all observances, so constant at the altar rail; none so versed in\nrubrics, ritual, and canon law; none had such a knowledge of the Church\nfathers. Mr. Atterbury delighted to discuss them with the rector at\nthe dinner parties where they met; none was more zealous for foreign\nmissions. He was the treasurer of St. John's.\n\nIt should undoubtedly have been a consolation to any rector to possess\nMr. Atterbury's unqualified approval, to listen to his somewhat delphic\ncompliments,--heralded by a clearing of the throat. He represented\nthe faith as delivered to the saints, and he spoke for those in the\ncongregation to whom it was precious. Why was it that, to Hodder, he\nshould gradually have assumed something of the aspect of a Cerberus? Why\nwas it that he incited a perverse desire to utter heresies?\n\nHodder invariably turned from his contemplation of Gordon Atterbury to\nthe double blaring pew, which went from aisle to aisle. In his heart, he\nwould have preferred the approval of Eleanor Goodrich and her husband,\nand of Asa Waring. Instinct spoke to him here; he seemed to read in\ntheir faces that he failed to strike in them responsive chords. He was\ndrawn to them: the conviction grew upon him that he did not reach them,\nand it troubled him, as he thought, disproportionately.\n\nHe could not expect to reach all. But they were the type to which he\nmost wished to appeal; of all of his flock, this family seemed best to\npreserve the vitality and ideals of the city and nation. Asa Waring was\na splendid, uncompromising survival; his piercing eyes sometimes met\nHodder's across the church, and they held for him a question and a\nriddle. Eleanor Goodrich bore on her features the stamp of true nobility\nof character, and her husband, Hodder knew, was a man among men. In\naddition to a respected lineage, he possessed an unusual blending of\naggressiveness and personal charm that men found irresistible.\n\nThe rector's office in the parish house was a businesslike room on the\nfirst floor, fitted up with a desk, a table, straight-backed chairs,\nand a revolving bookcase. And to it, one windy morning in March, came\nEleanor Goodrich. Hodder rose to greet her with an eagerness which, from\nhis kindly yet penetrating glance, she did not suspect.\n\n\"Am I interrupting you, Mr. Hodder?\" she asked, a little breathlessly.\n\n\"Not at all,\" he said, drawing up a chair. \"Won't you sit down?\"\n\nShe obeyed. There was an awkward pause during which the colour slowly\nrose to her face.\n\n\"I wanted to ask you one or two things,\" she began, not very steadily.\n\"As perhaps you may know, I was brought up in this church, baptized and\nconfirmed in it. I've come to fear that, when I was confirmed, I wasn't\nold enough to know what I was doing.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath, amazed at her boldness, for this wasn't in the\nleast how she had meant to begin. And she gazed at the rector anxiously.\nTo her surprise, he did not appear to be inordinately shocked.\n\n\"Do you know any better now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" she admitted. \"But the things of which I was sure at that\ntime I am not sure of now. My faith is--is not as complete.\"\n\n\"Faith may be likened to an egg, Mrs. Goodrich,\" he said. \"It must be\nkept whole. If the shell is chipped, it is spoiled.\"\n\nEleanor plucked up her courage. Eggs, she declared, had been used as\nillustrations by conservatives before now.\n\nHodder relieved her by smiling in ready appreciation.\n\n\"Columbus had reference to this world,\" he said. \"I was thinking of a\nmore perfect cue.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried, \"I dare say there is a more perfect one. I should hate\nto think there wasn't--but I can't imagine it. There's nothing in the\nBible in the way of description of it to make me really wish to go\nthere. The New Jerusalem is too insipid, too material. I'm sure I'm\nshocking you, but I must be honest, and say what I feel.\"\n\n\"If some others were as honest,\" said the rector, \"the problems of\nclergymen would be much easier. And it is precisely because people will\nnot tell us what they feel that we are left in the dark and cannot\nhelp them. Of course, the language of St. John about the future is\nfigurative.\"\n\n\"Figurative,--yes,\" she consented, \"but not figurative in a way that\nhelps me, a modern American woman. The figures, to be of any use, ought\nto appeal to my imagination--oughtn't they? But they don't. I can't see\nany utility in such a heaven--it seems powerless to enter as a factor\ninto my life.\"\n\n\"It is probable that we are not meant to know anything about the\nfuture.\"\n\n\"Then I wish it hadn't been made so explicit. Its very definiteness is\nsomehow--stultifying. And, Mr. Hodder, if we were not meant to know its\ndetails, it seems to me that if the hereafter is to have any real value\nand influence over our lives here, we should know something of its\nconditions, because it must be in some sense a continuation of this. I'm\nnot sure that I make myself clear.\"\n\n\"Admirably clear. But we have our Lord's example of how to live here.\"\n\n\"If we could be sure,\" said Eleanor, \"just what that example meant.\"\n\nHodder was silent a moment.\n\n\"You mean that you cannot accept what the Church teaches about his\nlife?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, I can't,\" she faltered. \"You have helped me to say it. I want to\nhave the Church's side better explained,--that's why I'm here.\" She\nglanced up at him, hesitatingly, with a puzzled wonder, such a positive,\ndynamic representative of that teaching did he appear. \"And my husband\ncan't,--so many people I know can't, Mr. Hodder. Only, some of them\ndon't mention the fact. They accept it. And you say things with such a\ncertainty--\" she paused.\n\n\"I know,\" he replied, \"I know. I have felt it since I have come here\nmore than ever before.\" He did not add that he had felt it particularly\nabout her, about her husband: nor did he give voice to his instinctive\nconviction that he respected and admired these two more than a hundred\nothers whose professed orthodoxy was without a flaw. \"What is it in\nparticular,\" he asked, troubled, \"that you cannot accept? I will do my\nbest to help you.\"\n\n\"Well--\" she hesitated again.\n\n\"Please continue to be frank,\" he begged.\n\n\"I can't believe in the doctrine of the virgin birth,\" she responded in\na low voice; \"it seems to me so--so material. And I feel I am stating a\ndifficulty that many have, Mr. Hodder. Why should it have been thought\nnecessary for God to have departed from what is really a sacred and\nsublime fact in nature, to resort to a material proof in order to\nconvince a doubting humanity that Jesus was his Son? Oughtn't the proof\nof Christ's essential God-ship to lie in his life, to be discerned by\nthe spiritual; and wasn't he continually rebuking those who demanded\nmaterial proof? The very acceptance of a material proof, it seems to me,\nis a denial of faith, since faith ceases to have any worth whatever the\nmoment the demand for such proof is gratified. Knowledge puts faith out\nof the question, for faith to me means a trusting on spiritual grounds.\nAnd surely the acceptance of scriptural statements like that of\nthe miraculous birth without investigation is not faith--it is mere\ncredulity. If Jesus had been born in a miraculous way, the disciples\nmust have known it. Joseph must have known it when he heard the\nanswer 'I must be about my father's business,' and their doubts are\nunexplained.\"\n\n\"I see you have been investigating,\" said the rector.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Eleanor, with an unconscious shade of defiance, \"people\nwant to know, Mr. Dodder,--they want to know the truth. And if you\nconsider the preponderance of the evidence of the Gospels themselves--my\nbrother-in-law says--you will find that the miraculous birth has very\nlittle to stand on. Take out the first two chapters of Matthew and\nLuke, and the rest of the four Gospels practically contradict it. The\ngenealogies differ, and they both trace through Joseph.\"\n\n\"I think people suffer in these days from giving too much weight to\nthe critics of Christianity,\" said the rector, \"from not pondering more\ndeeply on its underlying truths. Do not think that I am accusing you of\nsuperficiality, Mrs. Goodrich; I am sure you wish to go to the bottom,\nor else you would be satisfied with what you have already read and\nheard.\"\n\n\"I do,\" she murmured.\n\n\"And the more one reflects on the life of our Lord, the more one is\nconvinced that the doctrine of the virgin birth is a vital essential;\nwithout it Christianity falls to pieces. Let us go at the matter the\nother way round. If we attribute to our Lord a natural birth, we come at\nonce to the dilemma of having to admit that he was merely an individual\nhuman person,--in an unsurpassed relationship with God, it is true, but\nstill a human person. That doctrine makes Christ historical, some one\nto go back to, instead of the ever-present, preexistent Son of God and\nmankind. I will go as far as to assert that if the virgin birth had\nnever been mentioned in the Gospels, it would nevertheless inevitably\nhave become a fundamental doctrine of the Christian faith. Such a truth\nis too vast, too far-reaching to have been neglected, and it has a much\nhigher significance than the mere record of a fact. In spite of the\ncontradictions of science, it explains as nothing else can the mystery\nof the divinity as well as the humanity of the Saviour.\"\n\nEleanor was unconvinced. She felt, as she listened, the pressure of\nhis sincerity and force, and had to strive to prevent her thoughts from\nbecoming confused.\n\n\"No, Mr. Hodder, I simply can't see any reason for resorting to a\nphysical miracle in order to explain a spiritual mystery. I can see why\nthe ancients demanded a sign of divinity as it were. But for us it has\nceased even to be that. It can't be proved. You ask me, in the face\nof overwhelming evidence against it, to teach my children that the\nIncarnation depends on it, but when they grow up and go to college and\nfind it discredited they run the risk of losing everything else with it.\nAnd for my part, I fail utterly to see why, if with God all things are\npossible, it isn't quite as believable, as we gather from St. Mark's\nGospel, that he incarnated himself in one naturally born. If you reach\nthe conclusion that Jesus was not a mere individual human person, you\nreach it through the contemplation of his life and death.\"\n\n\"Then it isn't the physical miracle you object to, especially?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"It's the uselessness of it, for this age,\" she exclaimed. \"I think\nclergymen don't understand the harm it is doing in concentrating the\nattention on such a vulnerable and non-essential point. Those of us who\nare striving to reorganize our beliefs and make them tenable, do not\nbother our heads about miracles. They may be true, or may not, or some\nof them may be. We are beginning to see that the virgin birth does not\nadd anything to Christ. We are beginning to see that perfection and\nindividuality are not incompatible,--one is divine, and the other human.\nAnd isn't it by his very individuality that we are able to recognize\nJesus to-day?\"\n\n\"You have evidently thought and read a great deal,\" Dodder said,\ngenuinely surprised. \"Why didn't you come to me earlier?\"\n\nEleanor bit her lip. He smiled a little.\n\n\"I think I can answer that for you,\" he went on; \"you believe we are\nprejudiced,--I've no doubt many of us are. You think we are bound\nto stand up for certain dogmas, or go down, and that our minds are\nconsequently closed. I am not blaming you,\" he added quickly, as she\ngave a sign of protest, \"but I assure you that most of us, so far as my\nobservation has gone, are honestly trying to proclaim the truth as we\nsee it.\"\n\n\"Insincerity is the last thing I should have accused you of, Mr.\nHodder,\" she said flushing. \"As I told you, you seem so sure.\"\n\n\"I don't pretend to infallibility, except so far as I maintain that\nthe Church is the guardian of certain truths which human experience has\nverified. Let me ask you if you have thought out the difference\nyour conception of the Incarnation;--the lack of a patently divine\ncommission, as it were,--makes in the doctrine of grace?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" she answered, \"a little. It gives me more hope. I cannot\nthink I am totally depraved. I do not believe that God wishes me to\nthink so. And while I am still aware of the distance between Christ's\nperfection and my own imperfection, I feel that the possibility is\ngreater of lessening that distance. It gives me more self-respect, more\nself-reliance. George Bridges says that the logical conclusion of\nthat old doctrine is what philosophers call determinism--Calvinistic\npredestination. I can't believe in that. The kind of grace God gives me\nis the grace to help myself by drawing force from the element of him in\nmy soul. He gives me the satisfaction of developing.\"\n\n\"Of one thing I am assured, Mrs. Goodrich,\" Hodder replied, \"that the\nlogical result of independent thinking is anarchy. Under this modern\ntendency toward individual creeds, the Church has split and split again\nuntil, if it keeps on, we shall have no Church at all to carry on the\nwork of our Lord on earth. History proves that to take anything\naway from the faith is to atrophy, to destroy it. The answer to your\narguments is to be seen on every side, atheism, hypocrisy, vice, misery,\ninsane and cruel grasping after wealth. There is only one remedy I can\nsee,\" he added, inflexibly, yet with a touch of sadness, \"believe.\"\n\n\"What if we can't believe?\" she asked.\n\n\"You can.\" He spoke with unshaken conviction.\n\n\"You can if you make the effort, and I am sure you will. My experience\nis that in the early stages of spiritual development we are impervious\nto certain truths. Will you permit me to recommend to you certain books\ndealing with these questions in a modern way?\"\n\n\"I will read them gladly,\" she said, and rose.\n\n\"And then, perhaps, we may have another talk,\" he added, looking down at\nher. \"Give my regards to your husband.\"\n\nYet, as he stood in the window looking after her retreating figure,\nthere gradually grew upon him a vague and uncomfortable feeling that\nhe had not been satisfactory, and this was curiously coupled with the\nrealization that the visit had added a considerable increment to his\nalready pronounced liking for Eleanor Goodrich. She was, paradoxically,\nhis kind of a person--such was the form the puzzle took. And so ably had\nshe presented her difficulties that, at one point of the discussion,\nit had ironically occurred to him to refer her to Gordon Atterbury. Mr.\nAtterbury's faith was like an egg, and he took precious care not to have\nit broken or chipped.\n\nHodder found himself smiling. It was perhaps inevitable that he began at\nonce to contrast Mrs. Goodrich with other feminine parishioners who\nhad sought him out, and who had surrendered unconditionally. They had\nevinced an equally disturbing tendency,--a willingness to be overborne.\nFor had he not, indeed, overborne them? He could not help suspecting\nthese other ladies of a craving for the luxury of the confessional. One\nthing was certain,--he had much less respect for them than for Eleanor\nGoodrich....\n\nThat afternoon he sent her the list of books. But the weeks passed,\nand she did not come back. Once, when he met her at a dinner of Mrs.\nPreston's, both avoided the subject of her visit, both were conscious\nof a constraint. She did not know how often, unseen by her, his eyes had\nsought her out from the chancel. For she continued to come to church as\nfrequently as before, and often brought her husband.\n\n\n\nII\n\nOne bright and boisterous afternoon in March, Hodder alighted from an\nelectric car amid a swirl of dust and stood gazing for a moment at the\nstone gate-houses of that 'rus in urbe', Waverley Place, and at the gold\nblock-letters written thereon, \"No Thoroughfare.\" Against those gates\nand their contiguous grill the rude onward rush of the city had\nbeaten in vain, and, baffled, had swept around their serene enclosure,\nwestward.\n\nWithin, a silvery sunlight lit up the grass of the island running down\nthe middle, and in the beds the softening earth had already been broken\nby the crocus sheaves. The bare branches of the trees swayed in the\ngusts. As Hodder penetrated this hallowed precinct he recognized, on\neither hand, the residences of several of his parishioners, each in its\nample allotted space: Mrs. Larrabbee's; the Laureston Greys'; Thurston\nGore's, of which Mr. Wallis Plimpton was now the master,--Mr. Plimpton,\nbefore whose pertinacity the walls of Jericho had fallen; and finally\nthe queer, twisted Richardson mansion of the Everett Constables, whither\nhe was bound, with its recessed doorway and tiny windows peeping out\nfrom under mediaeval penthouses.\n\nHe was ushered into a library where the shades were already drawn, where\na-white-clothed tea-table was set before the fire, the red rays dancing\non the silver tea-kettle. On the centre-table he was always sure to\nfind, neatly set in a rack, the books about which the world was\ntalking, or rather would soon begin to talk; and beside them were ranged\nmagazines; French, English, and American, Punch, the Spectator, the\nNation, the 'Revue des deux Mondes'. Like the able general she was, Mrs.\nConstable kept her communications open, and her acquaintance was by\nno means confined to the city of her nativity. And if a celebrity were\npassing through, it were pretty safe, if in doubt, to address him in her\ncare.\n\nHodder liked and admired her, but somehow she gave him the impression\nof having attained her ascendancy at a price, an ascendancy which\nhad apparently been gained by impressing upon her environment a new\nnote--literary, aesthetic, cosmopolitan. She held herself, and those she\ncarried with her, abreast of the times, and he was at a loss to see how\nso congenial an effort could have left despite her sweetness--the little\nmark of hardness he discerned, of worldliness. For she was as well\nborn as any woman in the city, and her husband was a Constable. He had\ninherited, so the rector had been informed, one of those modest fortunes\nthat were deemed affluence in the eighties. His keeping abreast of the\ntimes was the enigma, and Hodder had often wondered how financial genius\nhad contrived to house itself in the well-dressed, gently pompous little\nman whose lack of force seemed at times so painfully evident. And yet he\nwas rated one of the rich men of the city, and his name Hodder had read\non many boards with Mr. Parr's!\n\nA person more versed in the modern world of affairs than the late rector\nof Bremerton would not have been so long in arriving at the answer\nto this riddle. Hodder was astute, he saw into people more than they\nsuspected, but he was not sophisticated.\n\nHe stood picturing, now, the woman in answer to whose summons he had\ncome. With her finely chiselled features, her abundant white hair, her\nslim figure and erect carriage she reminded him always of a Vigee Lebrun\nportrait. He turned at the sound of her voice behind him.\n\n\"How good of you to come, Mr. Hodder, when you were so busy,\" she said,\ntaking his hand as she seated herself behind the tea-kettle. \"I wanted\nthe chance to talk to you, and it seemed the best way. What is that you\nhave, Soter's book?\"\n\n\"I pinked it up on the table,\" he explained.\n\n\"Then you haven't read it? You ought to. As a clergyman, it would\ninterest you. Religion treated from the economic side, you know, the\neffect of lack of nutrition on character. Very unorthodox, of course.\"\n\n\"I find that I have very little time to read,\" he said. \"I sometimes\ntake a book along in the cars.\"\n\n\"Your profession is not so leisurely as it once was, I often think it\nsuch a pity. But you, too, are paying the penalty of complexity.\" She\nsmiled at him sympathetically. \"How is Mr. Parr? I haven't seen him for\nseveral weeks.\"\n\n\"He seemed well when I saw him last,\" replied Hodder.\n\n\"He's a wonderful man; the amount of work he accomplishes without\napparent effort is stupendous.\" Mrs. Constable cast what seemed a\ntentative glance at the powerful head, and handed him his tea. \"I wanted\nto talk to you about Gertrude,\" she said.\n\nHe looked unenlightened.\n\n\"About my daughter, Mrs. Warren. She lives in New York, you know--on\nLong Island.\"\n\nThen he had remembered something he had heard.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"She met you, at the Fergusons', just for a moment, when she was out\nhere last autumn. What really nice and simple people the Fergusons are,\nwith all their money!\"\n\n\"Very nice indeed,\" he agreed, puzzled.\n\n\"I have been sorry for them in the past,\" she went on evenly. \"They had\nrather a hard time--perhaps you may have heard. Nobody appreciated them.\nThey were entombed, so to speak, in a hideous big house over on the\nSouth Side, which fortunately burned down, and then they bought in Park\nStreet, and took a pew in St. John's. I suppose the idea of that huge\ndepartment store was rather difficult to get used to. But I made up my\nmind it was nonsense to draw the line at department stores, especially\nsince Mr. Ferguson's was such a useful and remarkable one, so I\nwent across and called. Mrs. Ferguson was so grateful, it was almost\npathetic. And she's a very good friend--she came here everyday when\nGenevieve had appendicitis.\"\n\n\"She's a good woman,\" the rector said.\n\n\"And Nan,--I adore Nan, everybody adores Nan. She reminds me of one of\nthose exquisite, blue-eyed dolls her father imports. Now if I were\na bachelor, Mr. Hodder--!\" Mrs. Constable left the rest to his\nimagination.\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"I'm afraid Miss Ferguson has her own ideas.\" Running through Hodder's\nmind, a troubled current, were certain memories connected with Mrs.\nWarren. Was she the divorced daughter, or was she not?\n\n\"But I was going to speak to you about Gertrude. She's had such a\nhard time, poor dear, my heart has bled for her.\" There was a barely\nperceptible tremor in Mrs. Constable's voice. \"All that publicity, and\nthe inevitable suffering connected with it! And no one can know the\nmisery she went through, she is so sensitive. But now, at last, she has\na chance for happiness--the real thing has come.\"\n\n\"The real thing!\" he echoed.\n\n\"Yes. She's going to marry a splendid man, Eldridge Sumner. I know the\nfamily well. They have always stood for public spirit, and this Mr.\nSummer, although he is little over thirty, was chairman of that Vice\nCommission which made such a stir in New York a year ago. He's a lawyer,\nwith a fine future, and they're madly in love. And Gertrude realizes\nnow, after her experience, the true values in life. She was only a child\nwhen she married Victor Warren.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Warren,\" Hodder managed to say, \"is still living.\"\n\n\"I sometimes wonder, Mr. Hodder,\" she went on hurriedly, \"whether we can\nrealize how different the world is today from what it was twenty years\nago, until something of this kind is actually brought home to us. I\nshall never forget how distressed, how overwhelmed Mr. Constable and I\nwere when Gertrude got her divorce. I know that they are regarding such\nthings differently in the East, but out here!--We never dreamed that\nsuch a thing could happen to us, and we regarded it as a disgrace.\nBut gradually--\" she hesitated, and looked at the motionless\nclergyman--\"gradually I began to see Gertrude's point of view, to\nunderstand that she had made a mistake, that she had been too young to\ncomprehend what she was doing. Victor Warren had been ruined by money,\nhe wasn't faithful to her, but an extraordinary thing has happened in\nhis case. He's married again, and Gertrude tells me he's absurdly happy,\nand has two children.\"\n\nAs he listened, Hodder's dominating feeling was amazement that such a\ncourse as her daughter had taken should be condoned by this middle-aged\nlady, a prominent member of his congregation and the wife of a\nvestryman, who had been nurtured and steeped in Christianity. And not\nonly that: Mrs. Constable was plainly defending a further step, which\nin his opinion involved a breach of the Seventh Commandment! To have\ninvaded these precincts, the muddy, turbulent river of individualism had\nrisen higher than he would have thought possible....\n\n\"Wait!\" she implored, checking his speech,--she had been watching him\nwith what was plainly anxiety, \"don't say anything yet. I have a letter\nhere which she wrote me--at the time. I kept it. Let me read a part of\nit to you, that you may understand more fully the tragedy of it.\"\n\nMrs. Constable thrust her hand into her lap and drew forth a thickly\ncovered sheet.\n\n\"It was written just after she left him--it is an answer to my protest,\"\nshe explained, and began to read:\n\n\"I know I promised to love Victor, mother, but how can one promise to\ndo a thing over which one has no control? I loved him after he stopped\nloving me. He wasn't a bit suited to me--I see that now--he was\nattracted by the outside of me, and I never knew what he was like until\nI married him. His character seemed to change completely; he grew morose\nand quick-tempered and secretive, and nothing I did pleased him. We led\na cat-and-dog life. I never let you know--and yet I see now we might\nhave got along in any other relationship. We were very friendly when we\nparted, and I'm not a bit jealous because he cares for another woman who\nI can see is much better suited to him.\n\n\"'I can't honestly regret leaving him, and I'm not conscious of having\ndone anything wrong. I don't want to shock you, and I know how terribly\nyou and father must feel, but I can see now, somehow, that I had to go\nthrough this experience, terrible as it was, to find myself. If it were\nthirty years ago, before people began to be liberal in such matters, I\nshudder to think what might have become of me. I should now be one\nof those terrible women between fifty and sixty who have tried one\nfrivolity and excess after another--but I'm not coming to that! And my\nfriends have really been awfully kind, and supported me--even Victor's\nfamily. Don't, don't think that I'm not respectable! I know how you look\nat such things.'\" Mrs. Constable closed the letter abruptly.\n\n\"I did look at such things in that way,\" she added, \"but I've changed.\nThat letter helped to change me, and the fact that it was Gertrude\nwho had been through this. If you only knew Gertrude, Mr. Hodder, you\ncouldn't possibly think of her as anything but sweet and pure.\"\n\nAlthough the extent of Hodder's acquaintance with Mrs. Warren had been\nbut five minutes, the letter had surprisingly retouched to something\nlike brilliancy her faded portrait, the glow in her cheeks, the iris\nblue in her eyes. He recalled the little shock he had experienced\nwhen told that she was divorced, for her appeal had lain in her very\nfreshness, her frank and confiding manner. She was one of those\nwomen who seem to say, \"Here I am, you can't but like me:\" And he had\nresponded--he remembered that--he had liked her. And now her letter,\ndespite his resistance, had made its appeal, so genuinely human was it,\nso honest, although it expressed a philosophy he abhorred.\n\nMrs. Constable was watching him mutely, striving to read in his grave\neyes the effect of her pleadings.\n\n\"You are telling me this, Mrs. Constable--why?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because I wished you to know the exact situation before I asked you, as\na great favour to me, to Mr. Constable, to--to marry her in St.\nJohn's. Of course,\" she went on, controlling her rising agitation,\nand anticipating a sign of protest, \"we shouldn't expect to have any\npeople,---and Gertrude wasn't married in St. John's before; that wedding\nwas at Passumset our seashore place. Oh, Mr. Hodder, before you answer,\nthink of our feelings, Mr. Constable's and mine! If you could see Mr.\nConstable, you would know how he suffers--this thing has upset him more\nthan the divorce. His family have such pride. I am so worried about him,\nand he doesn't eat anything and looks so haggard. I told him I would see\nyou and explain and that seemed to comfort him a little. She is, after\nall, our child, and we don't want to feel, so far as our church\nis concerned, that she is an Ishmaelite; we don't want to have the\nspectacle of her having to go around, outside, to find a clergyman--that\nwould be too dreadful! I know how strict, how unflinching you are, and I\nadmire you for it. But this is a special case.\"\n\nShe paused, breathing deeply, and Hodder gazed at her with pity. What he\nfelt was more than pity; he was experiencing, indeed, but with a deeper\nemotion, something of that same confusion of values into which Eleanor\nGoodrich's visit had thrown him. At the same time it had not escaped his\nlogical mind that Mrs. Constable had made her final plea on the score of\nrespectability.\n\n\"It gives me great pain to have to refuse you,\" he said gently.\n\n\"Oh, don't,\" she said sharply, \"don't say that! I can't have made the\ncase clear. You are too big, too comprehending, Mr. Hodder, to have a\nhard-and-fast rule. There must be times--extenuating circumstances--and\nI believe the canons make it optional for a clergyman to marry the\ninnocent person.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is optional, but I do, not believe it should be. The question\nis left to the clergyman's' conscience. According to my view, Mrs.\nConstable, the Church, as the agent of God, effects an indissoluble\nbond. And much as I should like to do anything in my power for you and\nMr. Constable, you have asked the impossible,--believing as I do, there\ncan be no special case, no extenuating circumstance. And it is my duty\nto tell you it is because people to-day are losing their beliefs that we\nhave this lenient attitude toward the sacred things. If they still held\nthe conviction that marriage is of God, they would labour to make it a\nsuccess, instead of flying apart at the first sign of what they choose\nto call incompatibility.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" she said, \"we ought not to be punished for our mistakes! I\ncannot believe that Christ himself intended that his religion should be\nso inelastic, so hard and fast, so cruel as you imply. Surely there\nis enough unhappiness without making more. You speak of\nincompatibility--but is it in all cases such an insignificant matter?\nWe are beginning to realize in these days something of the effects of\ncharacter on character,--deteriorating effects, in many instances. With\ncertain persons we are lifted up, inspired to face the battle of life\nand overcome its difficulties. I have known fine men and women whose\nlives have been stultified or ruined because they were badly mated.\nAnd I cannot see that the character of my own daughter has deteriorated\nbecause she has got a divorce from a man with whom she was profoundly\nout of sympathy--of harmony. On the contrary, she seems more of a person\nthan she was; she has clearer, saner views of life; she has made her\nmistake and profited by it. Her views changed--Victor Warren's did not.\nShe began to realize that some other woman might have an influence over\nhis life--she had none, simply because he did not love her. And love is\nnot a thing we can compel.\"\n\n\"You are making it very hard for me, Mrs. Constable,\" he said. \"You\nare now advocating an individualism with which the Church can have no\nsympathy. Christianity teaches us that life is probationary, and if we\nseek to avoid the trials sent us, instead of overcoming them, we find\nourselves farther than ever from any solution. We have to stand by our\nmistakes. If marriage is to be a mere trial of compatibility, why go\nthrough a ceremony than which there is none more binding in human and\ndivine institutions? One either believes in it, or one does not. And,\nif belief be lacking, the state provides for the legalization of\nmarriages.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"If persons wish to be married in church in these days merely because\nit is respectable, if such be their only reason, they are committing\na great wrong. They are taking an oath before God with reservations,\nknowing that public opinion will release them if the marriage does not\nfulfil their expectations.\"\n\nFor a moment she gazed at him with parted lips, and pressing her\nhandkerchief to her eyes began silently to cry. The sudden spectacle, in\nthis condition, of a self-controlled woman of the world was infinitely\ndistressing to Hodder, whose sympathies were even more sensitive than\n(in her attempt to play upon them) she had suspected... She was aware\nthat he had got to his feet, and was standing beside her, speaking with\nan oddly penetrating tenderness.\n\n\"I did not mean to be harsh,\" he said, \"and it is not that I do not\nunderstand how you feel. You have made my duty peculiarly difficult.\"\n\nShe raised up to him a face from which the mask had fallen, from which\nthe illusory look of youth had fled. He turned away... And presently she\nbegan to speak again; in disconnected sentences.\n\n\"I so want her to be happy--I cannot think, I will not think that she\nhas wrecked her life--it would be too unjust, too cruel. You cannot know\nwhat it is to be a woman!\"\n\nBefore this cry he was silent.\n\n\"I don't ask anything of God except that she shall have a chance, and it\nseems to me that he is making the world better--less harsh for women.\"\n\nHe did not reply. And presently she looked up at him again, steadfastly\nnow, searchingly. The barriers of the conventions were down, she had\ncast her pride to the winds. He seemed to read in her a certain relief.\n\n\"I am going to tell you something, Mr. Hodder, which you may think\nstrange, but I have a reason for saying it. You are still a young man,\nand I feel instinctively that you have an unusual career before you.\nYou interested me the first time you stepped into the pulpit of St.\nJohn's--and it will do me good to talk to you, this once, frankly. You\nhave reiterated to-day, in no uncertain terms, doctrines which I once\nbelieved, which I was brought up to think infallible. But I have lived\nsince then, and life itself has made me doubt them.\n\n\"I recognize in you a humanity, a sympathy and breadth which you are\nyourself probably not aware of, all of which is greater than the rule\nwhich you so confidently apply to fit all cases. It seems to me that\nChrist did not intend us to have such rules. He went beyond them, into\nthe spirit.\n\n\"Under the conditions of society--of civilization to-day, most marriages\nare merely a matter of chance. Even judgment cannot foresee the\ndevelopment of character brought about by circumstances, by environment.\nAnd in many marriages I have known about intimately both the man and the\nwoman have missed the most precious thing that life can give something\nI cannot but think--God intends us to have. You see,\"--she smiled at him\nsadly--\"I am still a little of an idealist.\n\n\"I missed--the thing I am talking about, and it has been the great\nsorrow of my life--not only on my account, but on my husband's. And so\nfar as I am concerned, I am telling you the truth when I say I should\nhave been content to have lived in a log cabin if--if the gift had\nbeen mine. Not all the money in the world, nor the intellect, nor the\nphilanthropy--the so-called interests of life, will satisfy me for its\ndenial. I am a disappointed woman, I sometimes think a bitter woman. I\ncan't believe that life is meant to be so. Those energies have gone into\nambition which should have been absorbed by--by something more worth\nwhile.\n\n\"And I can see so plainly now that my husband would have been far, far\nhappier with another kind of woman. I drew him away from the only work\nhe ever enjoyed--his painting. I do not say he ever could have been a\ngreat artist, but he had a little of the divine spark, in his enthusiasm\nat least--in his assiduity. I shall never forget our first trip abroad,\nafter we were married--he was like a boy in the galleries, in the\nstudios. I could not understand it then. I had no real sympathy with\nart, but I tried to make sacrifices, what I thought were Christian\nsacrifices. The motive power was lacking, and no matter how hard I\ntried, I was only half-hearted, and he realized it instinctively--no\namount of feigning could deceive him. Something deep in me, which was\na part of my nature, was antagonistic, stultifying to the essentials of\nhis own being. Of course neither of us saw that then, but the results\nwere not long in developing. To him, art was a sacred thing, and it\nwas impossible for me to regard it with equal seriousness. He drew into\nhimself,--closed up, as it were,--no longer discussed it. I was hurt.\nAnd when we came home he kept on in business--he still had his father's\naffairs to look after--but he had a little workroom at the top of the\nhouse where he used to go in the afternoon....\n\n\"It was a question which one of us should be warped,--which personality\nshould be annihilated, so to speak, and I was the stronger. And as I\nlook back, Mr. Hodder, what occurred seems to me absolutely inevitable,\ngiven the ingredients, as inevitable as a chemical process. We were\nboth striving against each other, and I won--at a tremendous cost.\nThe conflict, one might say, was subconscious, instinctive rather than\ndeliberate. My attitude forced him back into business, although we had\nenough to live on very comfortably, and then the scale of life began to\nincrease, luxuries formerly unthought of seemed to become necessities.\nAnd while it was still afar off I saw a great wave rolling toward us,\nthe wave of that new prosperity which threatened to submerge us, and I\nseized the buoy fate had placed in our hands,--or rather, by suggestion,\nI induced my husband to seize it--his name.\n\n\"I recognized the genius, the future of Eldon Parr at a time when he was\nnot yet independent and supreme, when association with a Constable meant\nmuch to him. Mr. Parr made us, as the saying goes. Needless to say;\nmoney has not brought happiness, but a host of hard, false ambitions\nwhich culminated in Gertrude's marriage with Victor Warren. I set my\nheart on the match, helped it in every way, and until now nothing but\nsorrow has come of it. But my point--is this,--I see so clearly, now\nthat it is too late, that two excellent persons may demoralize each\nother if they are ill-mated. It may be possible that I had the germs of\nfalse ambition in me when I was a girl, yet I was conscious only of the\nideal which is in most women's hearts....\n\n\"You must not think that I have laid my soul bare in the hope of\nchanging your mind in regard to Gertrude. I recognize clearly, now, that\nthat is impossible. Oh, I know you do not so misjudge me,\" she added,\nreading his quick protest in his face.\n\n\"Indeed, I cannot analyze my reasons for telling you something of which\nI have never spoken to any one else.\"\n\nMrs. Constable regarded him fixedly. \"You are the strongest reason. You\nhave somehow drawn it out of me.... And I suppose I wish some one to\nprofit by it. You can, Mr. Hodder,--I feel sure of that. You may\ninsist now that my argument against your present conviction of the\nindissolubility of marriage is mere individualism, but I want you\nto think of what I have told you, not to answer me now. I know your\nargument by heart, that Christian character develops by submission, by\nsuffering, that it is the woman's place to submit, to efface herself.\nBut the root of the matter goes deeper than that. I am far from\ndeploring sacrifice, yet common-sense tells us that our sacrifice should\nbe guided by judgment, that foolish sacrifices are worse than\nuseless. And there are times when the very limitations of our\nindividuality--necessary limitation's for us--prevent our sacrifices\nfrom counting.\n\n\"I was wrong, I grant you, grievously wrong in the course I took, even\nthough it were not consciously deliberate. But if my husband had been an\nartist I should always have remained separated from his real life by a\nlimitation I had no power to remove. The more I tried, the more apparent\nmy lack of insight became to him, the more irritated he grew. I studied\nhis sketches, I studied masterpieces, but it was all hopeless. The thing\nwasn't in me, and he knew it wasn't. Every remark made him quiver.\n\n\"The Church, I think, will grow more liberal, must grow more liberal, if\nit wishes to keep in touch with people in an age when they are thinking\nout these questions for themselves. The law cannot fit all cases, I am\nsure the Gospel can. And sometimes women have an instinct, a kind of\nsecond sight into persons, Mr. Hodder. I cannot explain why I feel that\nyou have in you elements of growth which will eventually bring you more\ninto sympathy with the point of view I have set forth, but I do feel\nit.\"\n\nHodder did not attempt to refute her--she had, indeed, made discussion\nimpossible. She knew his arguments, as she had declared, and he had the\nintelligence to realize that a repetition of them, on his part, would\nbe useless. She brought home to him, as never before, a sense of\nthe anomalistic position of the Church in these modern days, of its\nappallingly lessened weight even with its own members. As a successor of\nthe Apostles, he had no power over this woman, or very little; he could\nneither rebuke her, nor sentence her to penance. She recognized his\nauthority to marry her daughter, to baptize her daughter's children,\nbut not to interfere in any way with her spiritual life. It was as a\npersonality he had moved her--a personality apparently not in harmony\nwith his doctrine. Women had hinted at this before. And while Mrs.\nConstable had not, as she perceived, shaken his conviction, the very\nvividness and unexpectedness of a confession from her--had stirred him\nto the marrow, had opened doors, perforce, which he, himself had marked\nforbidden, and given him a glimpse beyond before he could lower his\neyes. Was there, after all, something in him that responded in spite of\nhimself?\n\nHe sat gazing at her, his head bent, his strong hands on the arms of the\nchair.\n\n\"We never can foresee how we may change,\" he answered, a light in his\neyes that was like a smile, yet having no suggestion of levity. And his\nvoice--despite his disagreement--maintained the quality of his sympathy.\nNeither felt the oddity, then, of the absence of a jarring note. \"You\nmay be sure, at least, of my confidence, and of my gratitude for what\nyou have told me.\"\n\nHis tone belied the formality of his speech. Mrs. Constable returned his\ngaze in silence, and before words came again to either, a step sounded\non the threshold and Mr. Constable entered.\n\nHodder looked at him with a new vision. His face was indeed lined and\nworn, and dark circles here under his eyes. But at Mrs. Constable's\n\"Here's Mr. Hodder, dear,\" he came forward briskly to welcome the\nclergyman.\n\n\"How do you do?\" he said cordially. \"We don't see you very often.\"\n\n\"I have been telling Mr. Hodder that modern rectors of big parishes have\nfar too many duties,\" said his wife.\n\nAnd after a few minutes of desultory conversation, the rector left.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. \"WATCHMAN, WHAT OF THE NIGHT?\"\n\nIt was one of those moist nights of spring when the air is pungent with\nthe odour of the softened earth, and the gentle breaths that stirred\nthe curtains in Mr. Parr's big dining-room wafted, from the garden,\nthe perfumes of a revived creation,--delicious, hothouse smells. At\nintervals, showers might be heard pattering on the walk outside. The\nrector of St. John's was dining with his great parishioner.\n\nHere indeed were a subject for some modern master, a chance to picture\nfor generations to come an aspect of a mighty age, an age that may some\nday be deemed but a grotesque and anomalistic survival of a more ancient\nlogic; a gargoyle carved out of chaos, that bears on its features a\nresemblance to the past and the future.\n\nOur scene might almost be mediaeval with its encircling gloom, through\nwhich the heavy tapestries and shadowy corners of the huge apartment may\nbe dimly made out. In the center, the soft red glow of the candles, the\ngleaming silver, the shining cloth, the Church on one side--and what on\nthe other? No name given it now, no royal name, but still Power. The two\nare still in apposition, not yet in opposition, but the discerning may\nperchance read a prophecy in the salient features of the priest.\n\nThe Man of Power of the beginning of the twentieth century demands a\nsubtler analysis, presents an enigma to which the immortal portraits\nof forgotten Medicis and Capets give no clew. Imagine, if you can, a\nLorenzo or a Grand Louis in a tightly-buttoned frock coat! There must\nbe some logical connection between the habit and the age, since crimson\nvelvet and gold brocade would have made Eldon Parr merely ridiculous.\n\nHe is by no means ridiculous, yet take him out of the setting and put\nhim in the street, and you might pass him a dozen times without noticing\nhim. Nature, and perhaps unconscious art, have provided him with a\nprotective exterior; he is the colour of his jungle. After he has\ncrippled you--if you survive--you will never forget him. You will\nremember his eye, which can be unsheathed like a rapier; you will recall\nhis lips as the expression of a relentless negative. The significance\nof the slight bridge on the narrow nose is less easy to define. He\nis neither tall nor short; his face is clean-shaven, save for scanty,\nunobtrusive reddish tufts high on the cheeks; his hair is thin.\n\nIt must be borne in mind, however, that our rector did not see him in\nhis jungle, and perhaps in the traditional nobility of the lion there\nis a certain truth. An interesting biography of some of the powerful of\nthis earth might be written from the point of view of the confessor\nor the physician, who find something to love, something to pity, and\nnothing to fear--thus reversing the sentiments of the public.\n\nYet the friendship between John Hodder and Eldon Parr defied\nany definite analysis on the rector's part, and was perhaps the\nstrangest--and most disquieting element that had as yet come into\nHodder's life. The nature of his intimacy with the banker, if intimacy\nit might be called, might have surprised his other parishioners if they\ncould have been hidden spectators of one of these dinners. There were\nlong silences when the medium of communication, tenuous at best, seemed\nto snap, and the two sat gazing at each other as from mountain peaks\nacross impassable valleys. With all the will in the world, their souls\nlost touch, though the sense in the clergyman of the other's vague\nyearning for human companionship was never absent. It was this yearning\nthat attracted Hodder, who found in it a deep pathos.\n\nAfter one of these intervals of silence, Eldon Parr looked up from his\nclaret.\n\n\"I congratulate you, Hodder, on the stand you took in regard to\nConstable's daughter,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't suppose it was known,\" answered the rector, in surprise.\n\n\"Constable told me. I have reason to believe that he doesn't sympathize\nwith his wife in her attitude on this matter. It's pulled him\ndown,--you've noticed that he looks badly?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the rector. He did not care to discuss the affair; he had\nhoped it would not become known; and he shunned the congratulations of\nGordon Atterbury, which in such case would be inevitable. And in spite\nof the conviction that he had done his duty, the memory of his talk with\nMrs. Constable never failed to make him, uncomfortable.\n\nExasperation crept into Mr. Pares voice.\n\n\"I can't think what's got into women in these times--at Mrs. Constable's\nage they ought to know better. Nothing restrains them. They have reached\na point where they don't even respect the Church. And when that happens,\nit is serious indeed. The Church is the governor on our social engine,\nand it is supposed to impose a restraint upon the lawless.\"\n\nHodder could not refrain from smiling a little at the banker's\nconception.\n\n\"Doesn't that reduce the Church somewhere to the level of the police\nforce?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Eldon Parr, whose feelings seemed to be rising. \"I\nam sorry for Constable. He feels the shame of this thing keenly, and he\nought to go away for a while to one of these quiet resorts. I offered\nhim my car. Sometimes I think that women have no morals. At any rate,\nthis modern notion of giving them their liberty is sheer folly. Look\nwhat they have done with it! Instead of remaining at home, where they\nbelong, they are going out into the world and turning it topsy-turvy.\nAnd if a man doesn't let them have a free hand, they get a divorce and\nmarry some idiot who will.\"\n\nMr. Parr pushed back his chair and rose abruptly, starting for the door.\nThe rector followed him, forcibly struck by the unusual bitterness in\nhis tone.\n\n\"If I have spoken strongly, it is because I feel strongly,\" he said in\na strange, thickened voice. \"Hodder, how would you like to live in this\nhouse--alone?\"\n\nThe rector looked down upon him with keen, comprehending eyes, and saw\nEldon Parr as he only, of all men, had seen him. For he himself did not\nunderstand his own strange power of drawing forth the spirit from its\nshell, of compelling the inner, suffering thing to reveal itself.\n\n\"This poison,\" Eldon Parr went on unevenly, \"has eaten into my own\nfamily. My daughter, who might have been a comfort and a companion,\nsince she chose not to marry, was carried away by it, and thought it\nincumbent upon her to have a career of her own. And now I have a choice\nof thirty rooms, and not a soul to share them with. Sometimes, at night,\nI make up my mind to sell this house. But I can't do it--something\nholds me back, hope, superstition, or whatever you've a mind to call it.\nYou've never seen all of the house, have you?\" he asked.\n\nThe rector slowly shook his head, and the movement might have been one\nthat he would have used in acquiescence to the odd whim of a child. Mr.\nParr led the way up the wide staircase to the corridor above, traversing\nchamber after chamber, turning on the lights.\n\n\"These were my wife's rooms,\" he said, \"they are just as she left them.\nAnd these my daughter Alison's, when she chooses to pay me a visit. I\ndidn't realize that I should have to spend the last years of my life\nalone. And I meant, when I gave my wife a house, to have it the best in\nthe city. I spared nothing on it, as you see, neither care nor money.\nI had the best architect I could find, and used the best material. And\nwhat good is it to me? Only a reminder--of what might have been. But\nI've got a boy, Hodder,--I don't know whether I've ever spoken of him to\nyou--Preston. He's gone away, too. But I've always had the hope that he\nmight come back and get decently married, and live, here. That's why I\nstay. I'll show you his picture.\"\n\nThey climbed to the third floor, and while Mr. Parr way searching for\nthe electric switch, a lightning flash broke over the forests of the\npark, prematurely revealing the room. It was a boy's room, hung\nwith photographs of school and college crews and teams and groups\nof intimates, with deep window seats, and draped pennons of Harvard\nUniversity over the fireplace. Eldon Parr turned to one of the groups on\nthe will, the earliest taken at school.\n\n\"There he is,\" he said, pointing out a sunny little face at the bottom,\na boy of twelve, bareheaded, with short, crisping yellow hair, smiling\nlips and laughing eyes. \"And here he is again,\" indicating another\ngroup. Thus he traced him through succeeding years until they came to\nthose of college.\n\n\"There he is,\" said the rector. \"I think I can pick him out now.\"\n\n\"Yes; that's Preston,\" said his father, staring hard at the picture. The\nface had developed, the body had grown almost to man's estate, but the\nhint of crispness was still in the hair, the mischievous laughter in\nthe eyes. The rector gazed earnestly at the face, remembering his own\nboyhood, his own youth, his mind dwelling, too, on what he had heard of\nthe original of the portrait. What had happened to the boy, to bring to\nnaught the fair promise of this earlier presentment?\n\nHe was aroused by the voice of Eldon Parr, who had sunk into one of the\nleather chairs.\n\n\"I can see him now,\" he was saying, \"as he used to come running down\nthat long flight of stone steps in Ransome Street to meet me when I came\nhome. Such laughter! And once, in his eagerness, he fell and cut his\nforehead. I shall never forget how I felt. And when I picked him up he\ntried to laugh still, with the tears rolling down his face. You know the\nway a child's breath catches, Hodder? He was always laughing. And how\nhe used to cling to me, and beg me to take him out, and show such an\ninterest in everything! He was a bright boy, a remarkable child, I\nthought, but I suppose it was my foolishness. He analyzed all he saw,\nand when he used to go off in my car, Brennan, the engineer, would\nalways beg to have him in the cab. And such sympathy! He knew in an\ninstant when I was worried. I had dreams of what that boy would become,\nbut I was too sure of it. I went on doing other things--there were so\nmany things, and I was a slave to them. And before I knew it, he'd gone\noff to school. That was the year I moved up here, and my wife died. And\nafter that, all seemed to go wrong. Perhaps I was too severe; perhaps\nthey didn't understand him at boarding-school; perhaps I didn't pay\nenough attention to him. At any rate, the first thing I knew his whole\nnature seemed to have changed. He got into scrape after scrape at\nHarvard, and later he came within an ace of marrying a woman.\n\n\"He's my weakness to-day. I can say no to everybody in the world but to\nhim, and when I try to remember him as he used to come down those steps\non Ransome Street....\n\n\"He never knew how much I cared--that what I was doing was all for\nhim, building for him, that he might carry on my work. I had dreams of\ndeveloping this city, the great Southwest, and after I had gone Preston\nwas to bring them to fruition.\n\n\"For some reason I never was able to tell him all this--as I am telling\nyou. The words would not come. We had grown apart. And he seemed to\nthink--God knows why!--he seemed to think I disliked him. I had Langmaid\ntalk to him, and other men I trusted--tell him what an unparalleled\nopportunity he had to be of use in the world. Once I thought I had him\nstarted straight and then a woman came along--off the streets, or little\nbetter. He insisted on marrying her and wrecking his life, and when I\ngot her out of the way, as any father would have done, he left me. He\nhas never forgiven me. Most of the time I haven't even the satisfaction\nof knowing were he is--London, Paris, or New York. I try not to think\nof what he does. I ought to cut him off,--I can't do it--I can't do it,\nHodder--he's my one weakness still. I'm afraid--he'd sink out of sight\nentirely, and it's the one hold I have left on him.\"\n\nEldon Parr paused, with a groan that betokened not only a poignant\nsorrow, but also something of relief--for the tortures of not being able\nto unburden himself had plainly become intolerable. He glanced up and\nmet the compassionate eyes of the rector, who stood leaning against the\nmantel.\n\n\"With Alison it was different,\" he said. \"I never understood her--even\nwhen she was a child--and I used to look at her and wonder that she\ncould be my daughter. She was moody, intense, with a yearning for\naffection I've since sometimes thought--she could not express. I did not\nfeel the need of affection in those days, so absorbed was I in building\nup,--so absorbed and driven, you might say. I suppose I must accept\nmy punishment as just. But the child was always distant with me, and I\nalways remember her in rebellion; a dark little thing with a quivering\nlip, hair awry, and eyes that flashed through her tears. She would take\nany amount of punishment rather than admit she had been in the wrong. I\nrecall she had once a fox terrier that never left her, that fought all\nthe dogs in the neighbourhood and destroyed the rugs and cushions in the\nhouse. I got rid of it one summer when she was at the sea, and I think\nshe never forgave me. The first question she asked when she came home\nwas for that dog--Mischief, his name was--for Mischief. I told her what\nI had done. It took more courage than I had thought. She went to her\nroom, locked herself in, and stayed there, and we couldn't get her to\ncome out for two days; she wouldn't even eat.\n\n\"Perhaps she was jealous of Preston, but she never acknowledged it. When\nshe was little she used once in a while to come shyly and sit on my lap,\nand look at me without saying anything. I hadn't the slightest notion\nwhat was in the child's mind, and her reserve increased as she grew\nolder. She seemed to have developed a sort of philosophy of her own even\nbefore she went away to school, and to have certain strongly defined\ntastes. She liked, for instance, to listen to music, and for that very\nreason would never learn to play. We couldn't make her, as a child.\n\n\"Bad music, she said, offended her. She painted, she was passionately\nfond of flowers, and her room was always filled with them. When she came\nback from school to live with me, she built a studio upstairs. After\nthe first winter, she didn't care to go out much. By so pronounced a\ncharacter, young men in general were not attracted, but there were a\nfew who fell under a sort of spell. I can think of no other words strong\nenough, and I used to watch them when they came here with a curious\ninterest. I didn't approve of all of them. Alison would dismiss them or\nignore them or be kind to them as she happened to feel, yet it didn't\nseem to make any difference. One I suspect she was in love with--a\nfellow without a cent.\n\n\"Then there was Bedloe Hubbell. I have reason enough to be thankful now\nthat she didn't care for him. They've made him president, you know, of\nthis idiotic Municipal League, as they call it. But in those days he\nhadn't developed any nonsense, he was making a good start at the bar,\nand was well off. His father was Elias Hubbell, who gave the Botanical\nGarden to the city. I wanted her to marry Gordon Atterbury. He hung on\nlonger than any of them--five or six years; but she wouldn't hear of\nit. That was how the real difference developed between us, although the\ntrouble was deep rooted, for we never really understood each other. I\nhad set my heart on it, and perhaps I was too dictatorial and insistent.\nI don't know. I meant the best for her, God knows.... Gordon never got\nover it. It dried him up.\".... Irritation was creeping back into the\nbanker's voice.\n\n\"Then it came into Alison's head that she wanted to 'make something of\nher life,'--as she expressed it. She said she was wasting herself, and\nbegan going to lectures with a lot of faddish women, became saturated\nwith these nonsensical ideas about her sex that are doing so much harm\nnowadays. I suppose I was wrong in my treatment from the first. I never\nknew how to handle her, but we grew like flint and steel. I'll say this\nfor her, she kept quiet enough, but she used to sit opposite me at the\ntable, and I knew all the time what she was thinking of, and then I'd\nbreak out. Of course she'd defend herself, but she had her temper under\nbetter control than I. She wanted to go away for a year or two and study\nlandscape gardening, and then come back and establish herself in an\noffice here. I wouldn't listen to it. And one morning, when she was\nlate to breakfast, I delivered an ultimatum. I gave her a lecture on a\nwoman's place and a woman's duty, and told her that if she didn't marry\nshe'd have to stay here and live quietly with me, or I'd disinherit\nher.\"\n\nHodder had become absorbed in this portrait of Alison Parr, drawn by her\nfather with such unconscious vividness.\n\n\"And then?\" he asked.\n\nIn spite of the tone of bitterness in which he had spoken, Eldon Parr\nsmiled. It was a reluctant tribute to his daughter.\n\n\"I got an ultimatum in return,\" he said. \"Alison should have been a\nman.\" His anger mounted quickly as he recalled the scene. \"She said she\nhad thought it all out: that our relationship had become impossible;\nthat she had no doubt it was largely her fault, but that was the way she\nwas made, and she couldn't change. She had, naturally, an affection for\nme as her father, but it was very plain we couldn't get along together:\nshe was convinced that she had a right to individual freedom,--as she\nspoke of it,--to develop herself. She knew, if she continued to live\nwith me on the terms I demanded, that her character would deteriorate.\nCertain kinds of sacrifice she was capable of, she thought, but what I\nasked would be a useless one. Perhaps I didn't realize it, but it was\nslavery. Slavery!\" he repeated, \"the kind of slavery her mother had\nlived....\"\n\nHe took a turn around the room.\n\n\"So far as money was concerned, she was indifferent to it. She had\nenough from her mother to last until she began to make more. She\nwouldn't take any from me in any case. I laughed, yet I have never been\nso angry in my life. Nor was it wholly anger, Hodder, but a queer tangle\nof feelings I can't describe. There was affection mixed up in it--I\nrealized afterward--but I longed to take her and shake her and lock her\nup until she should come to her senses: I couldn't. I didn't dare. I was\nhelpless. I told her to go. She didn't say anything more, but there\nwas a determined look in her eyes when she kissed me as I left for the\noffice. I spent a miserable day. More than once I made up my mind to\ngo home, but pride stopped me. I really didn't think she meant what she\nsaid. When I got back to the house in the afternoon she had left for New\nYork.\n\n\"Then I began to look forward to the time when her money would give out.\nShe went to Paris with another young woman, and studied there, and then\nto England. She came back to New York, hired an apartment and a studio,\nand has made a success.\"\n\nThe rector seemed to detect an unwilling note of pride at the magic\nword.\n\n\"It isn't the kind of success I think much of, but it's what she started\nout to do. She comes out to see me, once in a while, and she designed\nthat garden.\"\n\nHe halted in front of the clergyman.\n\n\"I suppose you think it's strange, my telling you this,\" he said. \"It\nhas come to the point,\" he declared vehemently, \"where it relieves me to\ntell somebody, and you seem to be a man of discretion and common-sense.\"\n\nHodder looked down into Mr. Parr's face, and was silent. Perhaps he\nrecognized, as never before, the futility of the traditional words\nof comfort, of rebuke. He beheld a soul in torture, and realized with\nsudden sharpness how limited was his knowledge of the conditions of\nexistence of his own time. Everywhere individualism reared its ugly\nhead, everywhere it seemed plausible to plead justification; and once\nmore he encountered that incompatibility of which Mrs. Constable had\nspoken! He might blame the son, blame the daughter, yet he could not\ncondemn them utterly.... One thing he saw clearly, that Eldon Parr had\nslipped into what was still, for him, a meaningless hell.\n\nThe banker's manner suddenly changed, reverted to what it had been. He\narose.\n\n\"I've tried to do my duty as I saw it, and it comes to this--that we\nwho have spent the best years of our lives in striving to develop this\ncountry have no thanks from our children or from any one else.\"\n\nWith his hand on the electric switch, he faced Hodder almost defiantly\nas he spoke these words, and suddenly snapped off the light, as though\nthe matter admitted of no discussion. In semi-darkness they groped down\nthe upper flight of stairs....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD\n\n\nI\n\nWhen summer arrived, the birds of brilliant plumage of Mr. Hodder's\nflock arose and flew lightly away, thus reversing the seasons. Only the\nsoberer ones came fluttering into the cool church out of the blinding\nheat, and settled here and there throughout the nave. The ample Mr.\nBradley, perspiring in an alpaca coat, took up the meagre collection on\nthe right of the centre aisle; for Mr. Parr, properly heralded, had\ngone abroad on one of those periodical, though lonely tours that\nsent anticipatory shivers of delight down the spines of foreign\npicture-dealers. The faithful Gordon Atterbury was worshipping at the\nsea, and even Mr. Constable and Mr. Plimpton, when recalled to the city\nby financial cares, succumbed to the pagan influence of the sun, and\nwere usually to be found on Sunday mornings on the wide veranda of the\ncountry club, with glasses containing liquid and ice beside them, and\nsurrounded by heaps of newspapers.\n\nTo judge by St. John's, the city was empty. But on occasions, before\nhe himself somewhat tardily departed,--drawn thither by a morbid though\nimpelling attraction, Hodder occasionally walked through Dalton Street\nof an evening. If not in St. John's, summer was the season in Dalton\nStreet. It flung open its doors and windows and moved out on the steps\nand the pavements, and even on the asphalt; and the music of its cafes\nand dance-halls throbbed feverishly through the hot nights. Dalton\nStreet resorted neither to country club nor church.\n\nMr. McCrae, Hodder's assistant, seemed to regard these annual\nphenomena with a grim philosophy,--a relic, perhaps, of the Calvinistic\ndeterminism of his ancestors. He preached the same indefinite sermons,\nwith the same imperturbability, to the dwindled congregations in summer\nand the enlarged ones in winter. But Hodder was capable of no such\nresignation--if resignation it were, for the self-contained assistant\ncontinued to be an enigma; and it was not without compunction that he\nleft, about the middle of July, on his own vacation. He was tired, and\nyet he seemed to have accomplished nothing in this first year of the\ncity parish whereof he had dreamed. And it was, no doubt, for that very\nreason that he was conscious of a depressing exhaustion as his train\nrolled eastward over that same high bridge that spanned the hot and\nmuddy waters of the river. He felt a fugitive. In no months since he had\nleft the theological seminary, had he seemingly accomplished so little;\nin no months had he had so magnificent an opportunity.\n\nAfter he had reached the peaceful hills at Bremerton--where he had gone\non Mrs. Whitely's invitation--he began to look back upon the spring and\nwinter as a kind of mad nightmare, a period of ceaseless, distracted,\nand dissipated activity, of rushing hither and thither with no results.\nHe had been aware of invisible barriers, restricting, hemming him in on\nall sides. There had been no time for reflection; and now that he had a\nbreathing space, he was unable to see how he might reorganize his work\nin order to make it more efficient.\n\nThere were other perplexities, brought about by the glimpses he had\nhad into the lives and beliefs--or rather unbeliefs--of his new\nparishioners. And sometimes, in an unwonted moment of pessimism, he\nasked himself why they thought it necessary to keep all that machinery\ngoing when it had so little apparent effect on their lives? He sat\nwistfully in the chancel of the little Bremerton church and looked into\nthe familiar faces of those he had found in it when he came to it,\nand of those he had brought into it, wondering why he had been foolish\nenough to think himself endowed for the larger work. Here, he had been\na factor, a force in the community, had entered into its life and\naffections. What was he there?\n\nNor did it tend to ease his mind that he was treated as one who has\npassed on to higher things.\n\n\"I was afraid you'd work too hard,\" said Mrs. Whitely, in her motherly\nway. \"I warned you against it, Mr. Hodder. You never spared yourself,\nbut in a big city parish it's different. But you've made such a success,\nNelson tells me, and everybody likes you there. I knew they would, of\ncourse. That is our only comfort in losing you, that you have gone to\nthe greater work. But we do miss you.\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe air of Bremerton, and later the air of Bar Harbor had a certain\nreviving effect. And John Hodder, although he might be cast down, had\nnever once entertained the notion of surrender. He was inclined to\nattribute the depression through which he had passed, the disappointment\nhe had undergone as a just punishment for an overabundance of ego,--only\nHodder used the theological term for the same sin. Had he not, after\nall, laboured largely for his own glory, and not Gods? Had he ever\nforgotten himself? Had the idea ever been far from his thoughts that it\nwas he, John Hodder, who would build up the parish of St. John's into\na living organization of faith and works? The curious thing was that he\nhad the power, and save in moments of weariness he felt it in him. He\nmust try to remember always that this power was from God. But why had he\nbeen unable to apply it?\n\nAnd there remained disturbingly in his memory certain phrases of Mrs.\nConstable's, such as \"elements of growth.\"\n\nHe would change, she had said; and he had appeared to her as one with\ndepths. Unsuspected depths--pockets that held the steam, which was\nincreasing in pressure. At Bremerton, it had not gathered in the\npockets, he had used it all--all had counted; but in the feverish,\nceaseless activity of the city parish he had never once felt that\nintense satisfaction of emptying himself, nor, the sweet weariness that\nfollows it. His seemed the weariness of futility. And introspection\nwas revealing a crack--after so many years--in that self that he had\nbelieved to be so strongly welded. Such was the strain of the pent-up\nforce. He recognized the danger-signal. The same phenomenon had driven\nhim into the Church, where the steam had found an outlet--until now. And\nyet, so far as his examination went, he had not lost his beliefs, but\nthe power of communicating them to others.\n\nBremerton, and the sight of another carrying on the work in which he had\nbeen happy, weighed upon him, and Bar Harbor offered distraction. Mrs.\nLarrabbee had not hesitated to remind him of his promise to visit her.\nIf the gallery of portraits of the congregation of St. John's were to\nbe painted, this lady's, at the age of thirty, would not be the least\ninteresting. It would have been out of place in no ancestral hall, and\nmany of her friends were surprised, after her husband's death, that she\ndid not choose one wherein to hang it. She might have. For she was the\nquintessence of that feminine product of our country at which Europe has\nnever ceased to wonder, and to give her history would no more account\nfor her than the process of manufacture explains the most delicate\nof scents. Her poise, her quick detection of sham in others not so\nfortunate, her absolute conviction that all things were as they ought\nto be; her charity, her interest in its recipients; her smile, which was\nkindness itself; her delicate features, her white skin with its natural\nbloom; the grace of her movements, and her hair, which had a different\ncolor in changing lights--such an ensemble is not to be depicted save by\na skilled hand.\n\nThe late Mr. Larrabbee's name was still printed on millions of bright\nlabels encircling cubes of tobacco, now manufactured by a Trust.\nHowever, since the kind that entered Mrs. Larrabbee's house, or houses,\nwas all imported from Egypt or Cuba, what might have been in the nature\nof an unpleasant reminder was remote from her sight, and she never drove\ninto the northern part of the city, where some hundreds of young women\nbent all day over the cutting-machines. To enter too definitely into\nMrs. Larrabbee's history, therefore, were merely to be crude, for she is\nnot a lady to caricature. Her father had been a steamboat captain--once\nan honoured calling in the city of her nativity--a devout Presbyterian\nwho believed in the most rigid simplicity. Few who remembered the\ngaucheries of Captain Corington's daughter on her first presentation\nto his family's friends could recognize her in the cosmopolitan Mrs.\nLarrabbee. Why, with New York and London at her disposal, she elected to\nremain in the Middle West, puzzled them, though they found her answer,\n\"that she belonged there,\" satisfying Grace Larrabbee's cosmopolitanism\nwas of that apperception that knows the value of roots, and during her\nwidowhood she had been thrusting them out. Mrs. Larrabbee followed by\n\"of\" was much more important than just Mrs. Larrabbee. And she was,\nmoreover, genuinely attached to her roots.\n\nHer girlhood shyness--rudeness, some called it, mistaking the effect\nfor the cause--had refined into a manner that might be characterized as\n'difficile', though Hodder had never found her so. She liked direct men;\nto discover no guile on first acquaintance went a long way with her, and\nnot the least of the new rector's social triumphs had been his simple\nconquest.\n\nEnveloped in white flannel, she met his early train at the Ferry; an\nunusual compliment to a guest, had he but known it, but he accepted it\nas a tribute to the Church.\n\n\"I was so afraid you wouldn't come,\" she said, in a voice that conveyed\nindeed more than a perfunctory expression. She glanced at him as he sat\nbeside her on the cushions of the flying motor boat, his strange eyes\nfixed upon the blue mountains of the island whither they were bound, his\nunruly hair fanned by the wind.\n\n\"Why?\" he asked, smiling at the face beneath the flying veil.\n\n\"You need the rest. I believe in men taking their work seriously, but\nnot so seriously as you do.\"\n\nShe was so undisguisedly glad to see him that he could scarcely have\nbeen human if he had not responded. And she gave him, in that fortnight,\na glimpse of a life that was new and distracting: at times made him\nforget--and he was willing to forget--the lower forms of which it was\nthe quintessence,--the factories that hummed, the forges that flung\ntheir fires into the night in order that it might exist; the Dalton\nStreets that went without. The effluvia from hot asphalt bore no\nresemblance to the salt-laden air that rattled the Venetian blinds of\nthe big bedroom to which he was assigned. Her villa was set high above\nthe curving shore, facing a sheltered terrace-garden resplendent in its\nAugust glory; to seaward, islands danced in the haze; and behind the\nhouse, in the sunlight, were massed spruces of a brilliant arsenic green\nwith purple cones. The fluttering awnings were striped cardinal and\nwhite.\n\nNature and man seemed to have conspired to make this place vividly\nunreal, as a toy village comes painted from the shop. There were no\nhalf-tones, no poverty--in sight, at least; no litter. On the streets\nand roads, at the casino attached to the swimming-pool and at the golf\nclub were to be seen bewildering arrays of well-dressed, well-fed women\nintent upon pleasure and exercise. Some of them gave him glances that\nseemed to say, \"You belong to us,\" and almost succeeded in establishing\nthe delusion. The whole effect upon Hodder, in the state of mind in\nwhich he found himself, was reacting, stimulating, disquieting. At\nluncheons and dinners, he was what is known as a \"success\"--always that\nmagic word.\n\nHe resisted, and none so quick as women to scent resistance. His very\nunbending attitude aroused their inherent craving for rigidity in his\nprofession; he was neither plastic, unctuous, nor subservient; his very\nhomeliness, redeemed by the eyes and mouth, compelled their attention.\nOne of them told Mrs. Larrabbee that that rector of hers would \"do\nsomething.\"\n\nBut what, he asked himself, was he resisting? He was by no means a\nPuritan; and while he looked upon a reasonable asceticism as having\nits place in the faith that he professed, it was no asceticism that\nprevented a more complete acquiescence on his part in the mad carnival\nthat surrounded him.\n\n\"I'm afraid you don't wholly approve of Bar Harbor,\" his hostess\nremarked; one morning.\n\n\"At first sight, it is somewhat staggering to the provincial mind,\" he\nreplied.\n\nShe smiled at him, yet with knitted brows.\n\n\"You are always putting me off--I never can tell what you think. And\nyet I'm sure you have opinions. You think these people frivolous, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Most of them are so,\" he answered, \"but that is a very superficial\ncriticism. The question is, why are they so? The sight of Bar Harbor\nleads a stranger to the reflection that the carnival mood has become\npermanent with our countrymen, and especially our countrywomen.\"\n\n\"The carnival mood,\" she repeated thoughtfully, \"yes, that expresses\nit. We are light, we are always trying to get away from ourselves, and\nsometimes I wonder whether there are any selves to get away from. You\nought to atop us,\" she added, almost accusingly, \"to bring us to our\nsenses.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" he agreed, \"why don't we? Why can't we?\"\n\n\"If more clergymen were like you, I think perhaps you might.\"\n\nHis tone, his expression, were revelations.\n\n\"I--!\" he exclaimed sharply, and controlled himself. But in that moment\nGrace Larrabbee had a glimpse of the man who had come to arouse in her\nan intense curiosity. For an instant a tongue of the fires of Vulcan had\nshot forth, fires that she had suspected.\n\n\"Aren't you too ambitious?\" she asked gently. And again, although she\ndid not often blunder, she saw him wince. \"I don't mean ambitious for\nyourself. But surely you have made a remarkable beginning at St. John's.\nEverybody admires and respects you, has confidence in you. You are so\nsure of yourself,\" she hesitated a moment, for she had never ventured\nto discuss religion with him, \"of your faith. Clergymen ought not to be\napologetic, and your conviction cannot fail, in the long run, to have\nits effect.\"\n\n\"Its effect,--on what?\" he asked.\n\nMrs. Larrabbee was suddenly, at sea. And she prided herself on a lack of\nthat vagueness generally attributed to her sex.\n\n\"On--on everything. On what we were talking about,--the carnival\nfeeling, the levity, on the unbelief of the age. Isn't it because the\ncontrol has been taken off?\"\n\nHe saw an opportunity to slip into smoother waters.\n\n\"The engine has lost its governor?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" cried Mrs. Larrabbee. \"What a clever simile!\"\n\n\"It is Mr. Pares,\" said Hodder. \"Only he was speaking of other symptoms,\nSocialism, and its opposite, individualism,--not carnivalism.\"\n\n\"Poor man,\" said Mrs. Larrabbee, accepting the new ground as safer, yet\nwith a baffled feeling that Hodder had evaded her once more, \"he has\nhad his share of individualism and carnivalism. His son Preston was here\nlast month, and was taken out to the yacht every night in an unspeakable\nstate. And Alison hasn't been what might be called a blessing.\"\n\n\"She must be unusual,\" said the rector, musingly.\n\n\"Oh, Alison is a Person. She has become quite the fashion, and has more\nwork than she can possibly attend to. Very few women with her good looks\ncould have done what she has without severe criticism, and something\nworse, perhaps. The most extraordinary thing about her is her contempt\nfor what her father has gained, and for conventionalities. It always\namuses me when I think that she might have been the wife of Gordon\nAtterbury. The Goddess of Liberty linked to--what?\"\n\nHodder thought instinctively of the Church. But he remained silent.\n\n\"As a rule, men are such fools about the women they wish to marry,\" she\ncontinued. \"She would have led him a dance for a year or two, and then\ncalmly and inexorably left him. And there was her father, with all his\nability and genius, couldn't see it either, but fondly imagined that\nAlison as Gordon Atterbury's wife, would magically become an Atterbury\nand a bourgeoise, see that the corners were dusted in the big house, sew\nunderwear for the poor, and fast in Lent.\"\n\n\"And she is happy--where she is?\" he inquired somewhat naively.\n\n\"She is self-sufficient,\" said Mrs. Larrabbee, with unusual feeling,\n\"and that is just what most women are not, in these days. Oh, why has\nlife become such a problem? Sometimes I think, with all that I have, I'm\nnot, so well off as one of those salesgirls in Ferguson's, at home. I'm\nalways searching for things to do--nothing is thrust on me. There are\nthe charities--Galt House, and all that, but I never seem to get at\nanything, at the people I'd like to help. It's like sending money\nto China. There is no direct touch any more. It's like seeing one's\nopportunities through an iron grating.\"\n\nHodder started at the phrase, so exactly had she expressed his own case.\n\n\"Ah,\" he said, \"the iron grating bars the path of the Church, too.\"\n\nAnd just what was the iron grating?\n\nThey had many moments of intimacy during that fort night, though none in\nwhich the plumb of their conversation descended to such a depth. For\nhe was, as she had said, always \"putting her off.\" Was it because he\ncouldn't satisfy her craving? give her the solution for which--he began\nto see--she thirsted? Why didn't that religion that she seemed outwardly\nto profess and accept without qualification--the religion he taught set\nher at rest? show her the path?\n\nDown in his heart he knew that he feared to ask.\n\n\n\nThat Mrs. Larrabbee was still another revelation, that she was not at\nrest, was gradually revealed to him as the days passed. Her spirit, too,\nlike his own, like 'Mrs Constable's, like Eldon Parr's, like Eleanor\nGoodrich's, was divided against itself; and this phenomenon in Mrs.\nLarrabbee was perhaps a greater shock to him, since he had always\nregarded her as essentially in equilibrium. One of his reasons,\nindeed,--in addition to the friendship that had grown up between\nthem,--for coming to visit her had been to gain the effect of her poise\non his own. Poise in a modern woman, leading a modern life. It was thus\nshe attracted him. It was not that he ignored her frivolous side; it was\nnicely balanced by the other, and that other seemed growing. The social,\nshe accepted at what appeared to be its own worth. Unlike Mrs. Plimpton,\nfor instance, she was so innately a lady that she had met with no\nresistance in the Eastern watering places, and her sense of values had\nremained the truer for it.\n\nHe did not admire her the less now he had discovered that the poise was\nnot so adjusted as he had thought it, but his feeling about her changed,\ngrew more personal, more complicated. She was showing an alarming\ntendency to lean on him at a time when he was examining with some\nconcern his own supports. She possessed intelligence and fascination,\nshe was a woman whose attentions would have flattered and disturbed any\nman with a spark of virility, and Hodder had constantly before his\neyes the spectacle of others paying her court. Here were danger-signals\nagain!\n\nMrs. Plaice, a middle-aged English lady staying in the house, never\nappeared until noon. Breakfast was set out in the tiled and sheltered\nloggia, where they were fanned by the cool airs of a softly breathing\nocean. The world, on these mornings, had a sparkling unreality, the\ncold, cobalt sea stretching to sun-lit isles, and beyond, the vividly\npainted shore,--the setting of luxury had never been so complete. And\nthe woman who sat opposite him seemed, like one of her own nectarines,\nto be the fruit that crowned it all.\n\nWhy not yield to the enchantment? Why rebel, when nobody else\ncomplained? Were it not more simple to accept what life sent in its\norderly course instead of striving for an impossible and shadowy ideal?\nVery shadowy indeed! And to what end were his labours in that smoky,\nwestern city, with its heedless Dalton Streets, which went their\ninevitable ways? For he had the choice.\n\nTo do him justice, he was slow in arriving at a realization that seemed\nto him so incredible, so preposterous. He was her rector! And he had\naccepted, all unconsciously, the worldly point of view as to Mrs.\nLarrabbee,--that she was reserved for a worldly match. A clergyman's\nwife! What would become of the clergyman? And yet other clergymen had\nmarried rich women, despite the warning of the needle's eye.\n\nShe drove him in her buckboard to Jordan's Pond, set, like a jewel in\nthe hills, and even to the deep, cliff bordered inlet beyond North East,\nwhich reminded her, she said, of a Norway fiord. And sometimes they\nwalked together through wooded paths that led them to beetling shores,\nand sat listening to the waves crashing far below. Silences and\ncommonplaces became the rule instead of the eager discussions with which\nthey had begun,--on such safer topics as the problem of the social\nwork of modern churches. Her aromatic presence, and in this\nsetting, continually disturbed him: nature's perfumes, more\ndefinable,--exhalations of the sea and spruce,--mingled with hers,\nanaesthetics compelling lethargy. He felt himself drowning, even wished\nto drown,--and yet strangely resisted.\n\n\"I must go to-morrow,\" he said.\n\n\"To-morrow--why? There is a dinner, you know, and Mrs. Waterman wished\nso particularly to meet you.\"\n\nHe did not look at her. The undisguised note of pain found an echo\nwithin him. And this was Mrs. Larrabbee!\n\n\"I am sorry, but I must,\" he told her, and she may not have suspected\nthe extent to which the firmness was feigned.\n\n\"You have promised to make other visits? The Fergusons,--they said they\nexpected you.\"\n\n\"I'm going west--home,\" he said, and the word sounded odd.\n\n\"At this season! But there is nobody in church, at least only a few, and\nMr. McCrae can take care of those--he always does. He likes it.\"\n\nHodder smiled in spite of himself. He might have told her that those\noutside the church were troubling him. But he did not, since he had\nsmall confidence in being able to bring them in.\n\n\"I have been away too long, I am getting spoiled,\" he replied, with an\nattempt at lightness. He forced his eyes to meet hers, and she read in\nthem an unalterable resolution.\n\n\"It is my opinion you are too conscientious, even for a clergyman,\" she\nsaid, and now it was her lightness that hurt. She protested no more.\nAnd as she led the way homeward through the narrow forest path, her head\nerect, still maintaining this lighter tone, he wondered how deeply she\nhad read him; how far her intuition had carried her below the surface;\nwhether she guessed the presence of that stifled thing in him which\nwas crying feebly for life; whether it was that she had discovered,\nor something else? He must give it the chance it craved. He must get\naway--he must think. To surrender now would mean destruction...\n\nEarly the next morning, as he left the pier in the motor boat, he saw\na pink scarf waving high above him from the loggia. And he flung up\nhis hand in return. Mingled with a faint sense of freedom was intense\nsadness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE LINE OF LEAST RESISTANCE\n\nFrom the vantage point of his rooms in the parish house, Hodder reviewed\nthe situation. And despite the desires thronging after him in his flight\nhe had the feeling of once who, in the dark, has been very near to\nannihilation. What had shaken him most was the revelation of an\nold enemy which, watching its chance, had beset him at the first\nopportunity; and at a time when the scheme of life, which he flattered\nhimself to have solved forever, was threatening once more to resolve\nitself into fragments. He had, as if by a miracle, escaped destruction\nin some insidious form.\n\nHe shrank instinctively from an analysis of the woman in regard to\nwhom his feelings were, so complicated, and yet by no means lacking in\ntenderness. But as time went on, he recognized more and more that she\nhad come into his life at a moment when he was peculiarly vulnerable.\nShe had taken him off his guard. That the brilliant Mrs. Larrabbee\nshould have desired him--or what she believed was him--was food enough\nfor thought, was an indication of an idealism in her nature that he\nwould not have suspected. From a worldly point of view, the marriage\nwould have commended itself to none of her friends. Yet Hodder perceived\nclearly that he could not have given her what she desired, since the\nmarriage would have killed it in him. She offered him the other thing.\nOnce again he had managed somehow to cling to his dream of what the\nrelationship between man and woman should be, and he saw more and more\ndistinctly that he had coveted not only the jewel, but its setting. He\ncould not see her out of it--she faded. Nor could he see himself in it.\n\nLuxury,--of course,--that was what he had spurned. Luxury in contrast\nto Dalton Street, to the whirring factories near the church which\ndischarged, at nightfall, their quotas of wan women and stunted\nchildren. And yet here he was catering to luxury, providing religion for\nit! Religion!\n\nEarly in November he heard that Mrs. Larrabbee had suddenly decided to\ngo abroad without returning home....\n\nThat winter Hodder might have been likened to a Niagara for energy; an\nunharnessed Niagara--such would have been his own comment. He seemed\nto turn no wheels, or only a few at least, and feebly. And while the\nspectacle of their rector's zeal was no doubt an edifying one to his\nparishioners, they gave him to understand that they would have been\nsatisfied with less. They admired, but chided him gently; and in\nFebruary Mr. Parr offered to take him to Florida. He was tired, and it\nwas largely because he dreaded the reflection inevitable in a period\nof rest, that he refused.... And throughout these months, the feeling\nrecurred, with increased strength, that McCrae was still watching\nhim,--the notion persisted that his assistant held to a theory of his\nown, if he could but be induced to reveal it. Hodder refrained from\nmaking the appeal. Sometimes he was on the point of losing patience with\nthis enigmatic person.\n\nCongratulations on the fact that his congregation was increasing brought\nhim little comfort, since a cold analysis of the newcomers who were\nrenting pews was in itself an indication of the lack of that thing he\nso vainly sought. The decorous families who were now allying themselves\nwith St. John's did so at the expense of other churches either more\nradical or less fashionable. What was it he sought? What did he wish?\nTo fill the church to overflowing with the poor and needy as well as the\nrich, and to enter into the lives of all. Yet at a certain point he met\na resistance that was no less firm because it was baffling. The Word, on\nhis lips at least, seemed to have lost it efficacy. The poor heeded it\nnot, and he preached to the rich as from behind a glass. They went on\nwith their carnival. Why this insatiate ambition on his part in an age\nof unbelief? Other clergymen, not half so fortunate, were apparently\nsatisfied; or else--from his conversation with them--either oddly\noptimistic or resigned. Why not he?\n\nIt was strange, in spite of everything, that hope sprang up within him,\na recurrent geyser.\n\nGradually, almost imperceptibly, he found himself turning more and\nmore towards that line of least resistance which other churches were\nfollowing, as the one Modern Solution,--institutional work. After all,\nin the rescuing of bodies some method might yet be discovered to revive\nthe souls. And there were the children! Hodder might have been likened\nto an explorer, seeking a direct path when there was none--a royal road.\nAnd if this were oblique it offered, at least, a definite outlet for his\nenergy.\n\nSuch was, approximately, the state of his mind early in March\nwhen Gordon Atterbury came back from a conference in New York on\ninstitutional work, and filled with enthusiasm. St. John's was\nincredibly behind the times, so he told Hodder, and later the vestry.\nNow that they had, in Mr. Hodder, a man of action and ability--ahem!\nthere was no excuse for a parish as wealthy as St. John's, a parish\nwith their opportunities, considering the proximity of Dalton Street\nneighbourhood, not enlarging and modernizing the parish house, not\nbuilding a settlement house with kindergartens, schools, workshops,\nlibraries, a dispensary and day nurseries. It would undoubtedly be an\nexpense--and Mr. Atterbury looked at Mr. Parr, who drummed on the vestry\ntable. They would need extra assistants, deaconesses, trained nurses,\nand all that. But there were other churches in the city that were ahead\nof St. John's--a reproach--ahem!\n\nMr. Parr replied that he had told the rector that he stood ready to\ncontribute to such a scheme when he, the rector; should be ready to\napprove it. And he looked at Mr. Hodder.\n\nMr. Hodder said he had been considering the matter ever since his\narrival. He had only one criticism of institutional work, that in his\nobservation it did not bring the people whom it reached into the Church\nin any great numbers. Perhaps that were too much to ask, in these days.\nFor his part he would willingly assume the extra burden, and he was\nfar from denying the positive good such work accomplished through\nassociation and by the raising of standards.\n\nMr. Ferguson declared his readiness to help. Many of his salesgirls,\nhe said, lived in this part of the city, and he would be glad to do\nanything in his power towards keeping them out of the dance-halls and\nsuch places.\n\nA committee was finally appointed consisting of Mr. Parr, Mr. Atterbury,\nand the rector, to consult architects and to decide upon a site.\n\nHodder began a correspondence with experts in other cities,\ncollected plans, pamphlets, statistics; spent hours with the great\nchild-specialist, Dr. Jarvis, and with certain clergymen who believed in\ninstitutionalism as the hope of the future.\n\nBut McCrae was provokingly non-committal.\n\n\"Oh, they may try it,\" he assented somewhat grudgingly, one day when the\nrector had laid out for his inspection the architects' sketch for the\nsettlement house. \"No doubt it will help many poor bodies along.\"\n\n\"Is there anything else?\" the rector asked, looking searchingly at his\nassistant.\n\n\"It may as well be that,\" replied McCrae.\n\nThe suspicion began to dawn on Hodder that the Scotch man's ideals were\nas high as his own. Both of them, secretly, regarded the new scheme as a\ncompromise, a yielding to the inevitable....\n\nMr. Ferguson's remark that an enlarged parish house and a new settlement\nhouse might help to keep some of the young women employed in his\ndepartment store out of the dance-halls interested Hodder, who conceived\nthe idea of a dance-hall of their own. For the rector, in the course of\nhis bachelor shopping, often resorted to the emporium of his vestryman,\nto stand on the stairway which carried him upward without lifting his\nfeet, to roam, fascinated, through the mazes of its aisles, where he\ninvariably got lost, and was rescued by suave floor-walkers or pert\nyoung women in black gowns and white collars and cuffs. But they were\nnot all pert--there were many characters, many types. And he often\nwondered whether they did not get tired standing on their feet all day\nlong, hesitating to ask them; speculated on their lives--flung as most\nof them were on a heedless city, and left to shift for themselves. Why\nwas it that the Church which cared for Mr. Ferguson's soul was unable\nto get in touch with, or make an appeal to, those of his thousand\nemployees?\n\nIt might indeed have been said that Francis Ferguson cared for his own\nsoul, as he cared for the rest of his property, and kept it carefully\ninsured,--somewhat, perhaps, on the principle of Pascal's wager. That\nhe had been a benefactor to his city no one would deny who had seen the\nfacade that covered a whole block in the business district from Tower\nto Vine, surmounted by a red standard with the familiar motto, \"When in\ndoubt, go to Ferguson's.\" At Ferguson's you could buy anything from a\npen-wiper to a piano or a Paris gown; sit in a cool restaurant in summer\nor in a palm garden in winter; leave your baby--if you had one--in\ncharge of the most capable trained nurses; if your taste were literary,\nmull over the novels in the Book Department; if you were stout, you\nmight be reduced in the Hygiene Department, unknown to your husband and\nintimate friends. In short, if there were any virtuous human wish in the\npower of genius to gratify, Ferguson's was the place. They, even taught\nyou how to cook. It was a modern Aladdin's palace: and, like everything\nelse modern, much more wonderful than the original. And the soda might\nbe likened to the waters of Trevi,--to partake of which is to return.\n\n\"When in doubt, go to Ferguson!\" Thus Mrs. Larrabbee and other ladies\ninterested in good works had altered his motto. He was one of the\nsupporters of Galt House, into which some of his own young saleswomen\nhad occasionally strayed; and none, save Mr. Parr alone, had been so\nliberal in his gifts. Holder invariably found it difficult to reconcile\nthe unassuming man, whose conversation was so commonplace, with the\ntitanic genius who had created Ferguson's; nor indeed with the owner of\nthe imposing marble mansion at Number 5, Park Street.\n\nThe rector occasionally dined there. He had acquired a real affection\nfor Mrs. Ferguson, who resembled a burgomaster's wife in her evening\ngowns and jewels, and whose simple social ambitions had been gratified\nbeyond her dreams. Her heart had not shrunken in the process, nor had\nshe forgotten her somewhat heterogeneous acquaintances in the southern\npart of the city. And it was true that when Gertrude Constable had\nnearly died of appendicitis, it was on this lady's broad bosom that Mrs.\nConstable had wept. Mrs. Ferguson had haunted the house, regardless\nof criticism, and actually quivering with sympathy. Her more important\ndinner parties might have been likened to ill-matched fours-in-hand, and\nHolder had sometimes felt more of pity than of amusement as she sat with\nan expression of terror on her face, helplessly watching certain\nunruly individuals taking their bits in their teeth and galloping madly\ndownhill. On one occasion, when he sat beside her, a young man, who\nshall be nameless, was suddenly heard to remark in the midst of an\naccidental lull:\n\n\"I never go to church. What's the use? I'm afraid most of us don't\nbelieve in hell any more.\"\n\nA silence followed: of the sort that chills. And the young man, glancing\ndown the long board at the clergyman, became as red as the carnation in\nhis buttonhole, and in his extremity gulped down more champagne.\n\n\"Things are in a dreadful state nowadays!\" Mrs. Ferguson gasped to\na paralyzed company, and turned an agonized face to Holder. \"I'm so\nsorry,\" she said, \"I don't know why I asked him to-night, except that I\nhave to have a young man for Nan, and he's just come to the city, and\nI was sorry for him. He's very promising in a business way; he's in Mr.\nPlimpton's trust company.\"\n\n\"Please don't let it trouble you.\" Holder turned and smiled a little,\nand added whimsically: \"We may as well face the truth.\"\n\n\"Oh, I should expect you to be good about it, but it was unpardonable,\"\nshe cried....\n\nIn the intervals when he gained her attention he strove, by talking\nlightly of other things, to take her mind off the incident, but\nsomehow it had left him strangely and--he felt--disproportionately\ndepressed,--although he had believed himself capable of facing more or\nless philosophically that condition which the speaker had so frankly\nexpressed. Yet the remark, somehow, had had an illuminating effect like\na flashlight, revealing to him the isolation of the Church as never\nbefore. And after dinner, as they were going to the smoking-room, the\noffender accosted him shamefacedly.\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Holder,\" he stammered.\n\nThat the tall rector's regard was kindly did not relieve his discomfort.\nHodder laid a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Don't worry about it,\" he answered, \"I have only one regret as to what\nyou said--that it is true.\"\n\nThe other looked at him curiously.\n\n\"It's mighty decent of you to take it this way,\" he laid. Further speech\nfailed him.\n\nHe was a nice-looking young man, with firm white teeth, and honesty was\nwritten all over his boyish face. And the palpable fact that his regret\nwas more on the clergyman's account than for the social faux pas drew\nHolder the more, since it bespoke a genuineness of character.\n\nHe did not see the yearning in the rector's eyes as he turned away...\nWhy was it they could not be standing side by side, fighting the same\nfight? The Church had lost him, and thousands like him, and she needed\nthem; could not, indeed, do without them.\n\nWhere, indeed, were the young men? They did not bother their heads about\nspiritual matters any more. But were they not, he asked himself, franker\nthan many of these others, the so-called pillars of the spiritual\nstructure?\n\nMr. Plimpton accosted him. \"I congratulate you upon the new plans, Mr.\nHodder,--they're great,\" he said. \"Mr. Parr and our host are coming down\nhandsomely, eh? When we get the new settlement house we'll have a plant\nas up-to-date as any church in the country. When do you break ground?\"\n\n\"Not until autumn, I believe,\" Hodder replied. \"There are a good many\ndetails to decide upon yet.\"\n\n\"Well, I congratulate you.\"\n\nMr. Plimpton was forever congratulating.\n\n\"Up-to-date\"--\"plant\"! More illuminating words, eloquent of Mr.\nPlimpton's ideals. St. John's down at the heels, to be brought up to the\nstate of efficiency of Mr. Plimpton's trust company! It was by no means\nthe first time he had heard modern attributes on Mr. Plimpton's lips\napplied to a sacred institution, but to-night they had a profoundly\ndisquieting effect. To-night, a certain clairvoyance had been vouchsafed\nhim, and he beheld these men, his associates and supporters, with a\ndetachment never before achieved.\n\nThey settled in groups about the room, which was square and high, and\npanelled in Italian walnut, with fluted pilasters,--the capitals of\nwhich were elaborately carved. And Hodder found himself on a deep\nleather sofa in a corner engaged in a desultory and automatic\nconversation with Everett Constable. Mr. Plimpton, with a large cigar\nbetween his lips, was the radiating centre of one of the liveliest\ngroups, and of him the rector had fallen into a consideration, piecing\ntogether bits of information that hitherto had floated meaninglessly in\nhis mind. It was Mrs. Larrabbee who had given character to the career of\nthe still comparatively youthful and unquestionably energetic president\nof the Chamber of Commerce by likening it to a great spiral, starting\nsomewhere in outer regions of twilight, and gradually drawing nearer to\nthe centre, from which he had never taken his eyes. At the centre\nwere Eldon Parr and Charlotte Gore. Wallis Plimpton had made himself\nindispensable to both.\n\nHis campaign for the daughter of Thurston Gore had been comparable\nto one of the great sieges of history, for Mr. Plimpton was a\nlaughing-stock when he sat down before that fortress. At the end of ten\nyears, Charlotte had capitulated, with a sigh of relief, realizing at\nlast her destiny. She had become slightly stout, revealing, as time went\non, no wrinkles--a proof that the union was founded on something more\nenduring than poetry: Statesmanship--that was the secret! Step by step,\nslowly but surely, the memoranda in that matrimonial portfolio were\ngrowing into accomplished facts; all events, such as displacements of\npower, were foreseen; and the Plimptons, like Bismarck, had only to\nindicate, in case of sudden news, the pigeonhole where the plan of any\nparticular campaign was filed.\n\nMrs. Larrabbee's temptation to be witty at the expense of those for\nwhom she had no liking had led Hodder to discount the sketch. He had not\ndisliked Mr. Plimpton, who had done him many little kindnesses. He was\ngood-natured, never ruffled, widely tolerant, hail-fellow-well-met with\neverybody, and he had enlivened many a vestry meeting with his stories.\nIt were hypercritical to accuse him of a lack of originality. And if by\ntaking thought, he had arrived, from nowhere, at his present position\nof ease and eminence, success had not turned to ashes in his mouth. He\nfairly exhaled well-being, happiness, and good cheer. Life had gone well\nwith him, he wished the same to others.\n\nBut to-night, from his corner, Hodder seemed to see Mr. Plimpton with\nnew eyes. Not that he stood revealed a villain, which he was far from\nbeing; it was the air of sophistication, of good-natured if cynical\nacceptance of things as they were--and plenty good enough, too!--that\njarred upon the rector in his new mood, and it was made manifest to him\nas never before why his appeals from the pulpit had lacked efficacy.\nMr. Plimpton didn't want the world changed! And in this desire he\nrepresented the men in that room, and the majority of the congregation\nof St. John's. The rector had felt something of this before, and it\nseemed to him astonishing that the revelation had not come to him\nsooner. Did any one of them, in his heart, care anything for the ideals\nand aspirations of the Church?\n\nAs he gazed at them through the gathering smoke they had become\nstrangers, receded all at once to a great distance.... Across the room\nhe caught the name, Bedloe Hubbell, pronounced with peculiar bitterness\nby Mr. Ferguson. At his side Everett Constable was alert, listening.\n\n\"Ten years ago,\" said a stout Mr. Varnum, the President of the Third\nNational Bank, \"if you'd told me that that man was to become a demagogue\nand a reformer, I wouldn't have believed you. Why, his company used\nto take rebates from the L. & G., and the Southern--I know it.\" He\nemphasized the statement with a blow on the table that made the liqueur\nglasses dance. \"And now, with his Municipal League, he's going to clean\nup the city, is he? Put in a reform mayor. Show up what he calls the\nConsolidated Tractions Company scandal. Pooh!\"\n\n\"You got out all right, Varnum. You won't be locked up,\" said Mr.\nPlimpton, banteringly.\n\n\"So did you,\" retorted Varnum.\n\n\"So did Ferguson, so did Constable.\"\n\n\"So did Eldon Parr,\" remarked another man, amidst a climax of laughter.\n\n\"Langmaid handled that pretty well.\"\n\nHodder felt Everett Constable fidget.\n\n\"Bedloe's all right, but he's a dreamer,\" Mr. Plimpton volunteered.\n\n\"Then I wish he'd stop dreaming,\" said Mr. Ferguson, and there was more\nlaughter, although he had spoken savagely.\n\n\"That's what he is, a dreamer,\" Varnum ejaculated. \"Say, he told George\nCarter the other day that prostitution wasn't necessary, that in fifty\nyears we'd have largely done away with it. Think of that, and it's as\nold as Sodom and Gomorrah!\"\n\n\"If Hubbell had his way, he'd make this town look like a Connecticut\nhill village--he'd drive all the prosperity out of it. All the railroads\nwould have to abandon their terminals--there'd be no more traffic, and\nyou'd have to walk across the bridge to get a drink.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Plimpton, \"Tom Beatty's good enough for me, for a\nwhile.\"\n\nBeatty, Hodder knew, was the \"boss,\" of the city, with headquarters in a\ndowntown saloon.\n\n\"Beatty's been maligned,\" Mr. Varnum declared. \"I don't say he's a\nsaint, but he's run the town pretty well, on the whole, and kept the\nvice where it belongs, out of sight. He's made his pile, but he's\nentitled to something we all are. You always know where you stand with\nBeatty. But say, if Hubbell and his crowd--\"\n\n\"Don't worry about Bedloe,--he'll get called in, he'll come home to\nroost like the rest of them,\" said Mr. Plimpton, cheerfully. \"The people\ncan't govern themselves,--only Bedloe doesn't know it. Some day he'll\nfind it out.\"...\n\nThe French window beside him was open, and Hodder slipped out,\nunnoticed, into the warm night and stood staring at the darkness. His\none desire had been to get away, out of hearing, and he pressed forward\nover the tiled pavement until he stumbled against a stone balustrade\nthat guarded a drop of five feet or so to the lawn below. At the same\ntime he heard his name called.\n\n\"Is that you, Mr. Hodder?\"\n\nHe started. The voice had a wistful tremulousness, and might almost\nhave been the echo of the leaves stirring in the night air. Then he\nperceived, in a shaft of light from one of the drawing-room windows near\nby, a girl standing beside the balustrade; and as she came towards him,\nwith tentative steps, the light played conjurer, catching the silvery\ngauze of her dress and striking an aura through the film of her hair.\n\n\"It's Nan Ferguson,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course,\" he exclaimed, collecting himself. \"How stupid of me not to\nhave recognized you!\"\n\n\"I'm so glad you came out,\" she went on impulsively, yet shyly, \"I\nwanted to tell you how sorry I was that that thing happened at the\ntable.\"\n\n\"I like that young man,\" he said.\n\n\"Do you?\" she exclaimed, with unexpected gratitude. \"So do I. He really\nisn't--so bad as he must seem.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it,\" said the rector, laughing.\n\n\"I was afraid you'd think him wicked,\" said Nan. \"He works awfully hard,\nand he's sending a brother through college. He isn't a bit like--some\nothers I know. He wants to make something of himself. And I feel\nresponsible, because I had mother ask him to-night.\"\n\nHe read her secret. No doubt she meant him to do so.\n\n\"You know we're going away next week, for the summer--that is, mother\nand I,\" she continued. \"Father comes later. And I do hope you'll make us\na visit, Mr. Hodder--we were disappointed you couldn't come last year.\"\nNan hesitated, and thrusting her hand into her gown drew forth an\nenvelope and held it out to him. \"I intended to give you this to-night,\nto use--for anything you thought best.\"\n\nHe took it gravely. She looked up at him.\n\n\"It seems so little--such a selfish way of discharging one's\nobligations, just to write out a cheque, when there is so much trouble\nin the world that demands human kindness as well as material help. I\ndrove up Dalton Street yesterday, from downtown. You know how hot it\nwas! And I couldn't help thinking how terrible it is that we who have\neverything are so heedless of all that misery. The thought of it took\naway all my pleasure.\n\n\"I'd do something more, something personal, if I could. Perhaps I shall\nbe able to, next winter. Why is it so difficult for all of us to know\nwhat to do?\"\n\n\"We have taken a step forward, at any rate, when we know that it is\ndifficult,\" he said.\n\nShe gazed up at him fixedly, her attention caught by an indefinable\nsomething in his voice, in his smile, that thrilled and vaguely\ndisturbed her. She remembered it long afterwards. It suddenly made her\nshy again; as if, in faring forth into the darkness, she had come to the\nthreshold of a mystery, of a revelation withheld; and it brought back\nthe sense of adventure, of the palpitating fear and daring with which\nshe had come to meet him.\n\n\"It is something to know,\" she repeated, half comprehending. The\nscraping of chairs within alarmed her, and she stood ready to fly.\n\n\"But I haven't thanked you for this,\" he said, holding up the envelope.\n\"It may be that I shall find some one in Dalton Street--\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope so,\" she faltered, breathlessly, hesitating a moment. And\nthen she was gone, into the house.\n\n\n\n\nVolume 3.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE DIVINE DISCONTENT\n\nI\n\nIt was the last Sunday in May, and in another week the annual flight\nto the seashore and the mountains would have begun again. The breezes\nstealing into the church through the open casements wafted hither\nand thither the odours of the chancel flowers, and mingled with those\nfainter and subtler perfumes set free by the rustling of summer gowns.\n\nAs on this day he surveyed his decorous and fashionable congregation,\nHodder had something of that sense of extremity which the great apostle\nto the Gentiles himself must have felt when he stood in the midst of the\nAreopagus and made his vain yet sublime appeal to Athenian indifference\nand luxury. \"And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now\ncommandeth all men everywhere to repent.\".. Some, indeed, stirred\nuneasily as the rector paused, lowering their eyes before the intensity\nof his glance, vaguely realizing that the man had flung the whole\npassion of his being into the appeal.\n\nHeedlessness--that was God's accusation against them, against the age.\nMaterialism, individualism! So absorbed were they in the pursuit of\nwealth, of distraction, so satisfied with the current philosophy, so\nintent on surrounding themselves with beautiful things and thus shutting\nout the sterner view, that they had grown heedless of the divine\nmessage. How few of them availed themselves of their spiritual\nbirthright to renew their lives at the altar rail! And they had\npermitted their own children to wander away.... Repent!\n\nThere was a note of desperation in his appeal, like that of the hermit\nwho stands on a mountain crag and warns the gay and thoughtless of the\nvalley of the coming avalanche. Had they heard him at last? There were a\nfew moments of tense silence, during which he stood gazing at them. Then\nhe raised his arm in benediction, gathered up his surplice, descended\nthe pulpit steps, and crossed swiftly the chancel....\n\nHe had, as it were, turned on all the power in a supreme effort to reach\nthem. What if he had failed again? Such was the misgiving that beset\nhim, after the service, as he got out of his surplice, communicated by\nsome occult telepathy.... Mr. Parr was awaiting him, and summoning his\ncourage, hope battling against intuition, he opened the door into the\nnow empty church and made his way toward the porch, where the sound of\nvoices warned him that several persons were lingering. The nature of\ntheir congratulations confirmed his doubts. Mrs. Plimpton, resplendent\nand looking less robust than usual in one of her summer Paris gowns,\ngreeted him effusively.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Hodder, what a wonderful sermon!\" she cried. \"I can't express\nhow it made me feel--so delinquent! Of course that is exactly the effect\nyou wished. And I was just telling Wallis I was so glad I waited until\nTuesday to go East, or I should have missed it. You surely must come on\nto Hampton and visit us, and preach it over again in our little stone\nchurch there, by the sea. Good-by and don't forget! I'll write you,\nsetting the date, only we'd be glad to have you any time.\"\n\n\"One of the finest I ever heard--if not the finest,\" Mr. Plimpton\ndeclared, with a kind of serious 'empressement', squeezing his hand.\n\nOthers stopped him; Everett Constable, for one, and the austere Mrs.\nAtterbury. Hodder would have avoided the ever familiar figure of her\nson, Gordon, in the invariable black cutaway and checked trousers, but\nhe was standing beside Mr. Parr.\n\n\"Ahem! Why, Mr. Hodder,\" he exclaimed, squinting off his glasses, \"that\nwas a magnificent effort. I was saying to Mr. Parr that it isn't\noften one hears a sermon nowadays as able as that, and as sound. Many\nclergymen refrain from preaching them, I sometimes think, because they\nare afraid people won't like them.\"\n\n\"I scarcely think it's that,\" the rector replied, a little shortly.\n\"We're afraid people won't heed them.\"\n\nHe became aware, as he spoke, of a tall young woman, who had cast an\nenigmatic glance first at Gordon Atterbury, and then at himself.\n\n\"It was a good sermon,\" said Mr. Parr. \"You're coming to lunch, Hodder?\"\n\nThe rector nodded. \"I'm ready when you are,\" he answered.\n\n\"The motor's waiting,\" said the banker, leading the way down the steps\nto the sidewalk, where he turned. \"Alison, let me introduce Mr. Hodder.\nThis is my daughter,\" he added simply.\n\nThis sudden disclosure of the young woman's identity had upon Hodder a\ncertain electric effect, and with it came a realization of the extent\nto which--from behind the scenes, so to speak--she had gradually aroused\nhim to a lively speculation. She seemed to have influenced, to a\ngreater or less degree, so many lives with which he had come into\ntouch! Compelled persons to make up their minds about her! And while he\nsympathized with Eldon Parr in his abandonment, he had never achieved\nthe full condemnation which he felt--an impartial Christian morality\nwould have meted out.\n\nAs he uttered the conventional phrase and took her hand, he asked\nhimself whether her personality justified his interest. Her glance at\nGordon Atterbury in the midst of that gentleman's felicitations on the\nsermon had been expressive, Hodder thought, of veiled amusement slightly\ntinctured with contempt; and he, Hodder, felt himself to have grown warm\nover it. He could not be sure that Alison Parr had not included, in her\ninner comment, the sermon likewise, on which he had so spent himself.\nWhat was she doing at church? As her eyes met his own, he seemed to\nread a challenge. He had never encountered a woman--he decided--who\nso successfully concealed her thought, and at the same time so incited\ncuriosity about it.\n\nThe effect of her reappearance on Gordon Atterbury was painfully\napparent, and Mrs. Larrabbee's remark, \"that he had never got over it,\"\nrecurred to Hodder. He possessed the virtue of being faithful, at least,\nin spite of the lady's apostasy, and he seemed to be galvanized into a\ntenfold nervousness as he hustled after them and handed her, with the\nelaborate attention little men are apt to bestow upon women, into the\nmotor.\n\n\"Er--how long shall you be here, Alison?\" he asked. \"I don't know,\" she\nanswered, not unkindly, but with a touch of indifference.\n\n\"You treat us shamefully,\" he informed her, \"upon my word! But I'm\ncoming to call.\"\n\n\"Do,\" said Alison. Hodder caught her eye again, and this time he was\nsure that she surprised in him a certain disdain of Mr. Atterbury's\nzeal. Her smile was faint, yet unmistakable.\n\nHe resented it. Indeed, it was with a well-defined feeling of antagonism\nthat he took his seat, and this was enhanced as they flew westward, Mr.\nParr wholly absorbed with the speaking trumpet, energetically rebuking\nat every bounce. In the back of the rector's mind lay a weight, which he\nidentified, at intervals, with what he was now convinced was the failure\nof his sermon... Alison took no part in the casual conversation that\nbegan when they reached the boulevard and Mr. Parr abandoned the\ntrumpet, but lay back in silence and apparently with entire comfort in a\ncorner of the limousine.\n\nAt the lunch-table Mr. Parr plunged into a discussion of some of the\nstill undecided details of the new settlement house, in which, as the\nplan developed, he had become more and more interested. He had made\nhimself responsible, from time to time, for additional sums, until the\noriginal estimate had been almost doubled. Most of his suggestions had\ncome from Hodder, who had mastered the subject with a thoroughness that\nappealed to the financier: and he had gradually accepted the rector's\nidea of concentrating on the children. Thus he had purchased an\nadjoining piece of land that was to be a model playground, in connection\nwith the gymnasium and swimming-pool. The hygienic department was to be\nall that modern science could desire.\n\n\"If we are going to do the thing,\" the banker would, remark, \"we may as\nwell do it thoroughly; we may as well be leaders and not followers.\"\n\nSo, little by little, the scheme had grown to proportions that sometimes\nappalled the rector when he realized how largely he had been responsible\nfor the additions,--in spite of the lukewarmness with which he had\nbegun. And yet it had occasionally been Mr. Parr who, with a sweep\nof his hand, had added thousands to a particular feature: thus the\ndance-hall had become, in prospect, a huge sun-parlour at the top of the\nbuilding, where the children were to have their kindergartens and games\nin winter; and which might be shaded and opened up to the breezes\nin summer. What had reconciled Hodder to the enterprise most of all,\nhowever, was the chapel--in the plan a beautiful Gothic church--whereby\nhe hoped to make the religious progress keep pace with the social. Mr.\nParr was decidedly in sympathy with this intention, and referred to it\nnow.\n\n\"I was much impressed by what you said in your sermon to-day as to the\nneed of insisting upon authority in religious matters,\" he declared,\n\"and I quite agree that we should have a chapel of some size at the\nsettlement house for that reason. Those people need spiritual control.\nIt's what the age needs. And when I think of some of the sermons printed\nin the newspapers to-day, and which are served up as Christianity, there\nis only one term to apply to them--they are criminally incendiary.\"\n\n\"But isn't true Christianity incendiary, in your meaning of the word?\"\n\nIt was Alison who spoke, in a quiet and musical voice that was in\nstriking contrast to the tone of Mr. Parr, which the rector had thought\nunusually emphatic. It was the first time she had shown an inclination\nto contribute to the talk. But since Hodder had sat down at the table\nher presence had disturbed him, and he had never been wholly free from\nan uncomfortable sense that he was being measured and weighed.\n\nOnce or twice he had stolen a glance at her as she sat, perfectly at\nease, and asked himself whether she had beauty, and it dawned upon\nhim little by little that the very proportion she possessed made for\nphysical unobtrusiveness. She was really very tall for a woman. At first\nhe would have said her nose was straight, when he perceived that it\nhad a delicate hidden curve; her eyes were curiously set, her dark hair\nparted in the middle, brought down low on each side of the forehead and\ntied in a Grecian knot. Thus, in truth, he observed, were seemingly all\nthe elements of the classic, even to the firm yet slender column of the\nneck. How had it eluded him?\n\nHer remark, if it astonished Hodder, had a dynamic effect on Eldon Parr.\nAnd suddenly the rector comprehended that the banker had not so much\nbeen talking to him as through him; had been, as it were, courting\nopposition.\n\n\"What do you mean by Christianity being incendiary?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Incendiary, from your point of view--I made, the qualification,\" Alison\nreplied, apparently unmoved by his obvious irritation. \"I don't\npretend to be a Christian, as you know, but if there is one element in\nChristianity that distinguishes it, it is the brotherhood of man.\nThat's pure nitroglycerin, though it's been mixed with so much sawdust.\nIncendiary is a mild epithet. I never read the sermons you refer to;\nI dare say they're crude, but they're probably attempts to release\nan explosive which would blow your comfortable social system and its\nauthority into atoms.\"\n\nHodder, who had listened in amazement, glanced at the banker. He had\nnever before heard him opposed, or seen him really angry.\n\n\"I've heard that doctrine,\" cried Mr. Parr. \"Those who are dissatisfied\nwith things as they are because they have been too stupid or too weak\nor self-indulgent to rise, find it easy to twist the principles of\nChristianity into revolutionary propaganda. It's a case of the devil\nquoting Scripture. The brotherhood of man! There has never been an age\nwhen philanthropy and organized charity were on such a scale as to-day.\"\n\nA certain gallant, indomitable ring crept into Alison's voice; she did\nnot seem in the least dismayed or overborne.\n\n\"But isn't that just where most so-called Christians make their\nmistake?\" she asked. \"Philanthropy and organized charity, as they exist\nto-day, have very little to do with the brotherhood of man. Mightn't it\nbe you who are fooling yourselves instead of the incendiaries fooling\nthemselves So long as you can make yourselves believe that this kind of\ncharity is a logical carrying out of the Christian principles, so long\nare your consciences satisfied with the social system which your class,\nvery naturally, finds so comfortable and edifying. The weak and idiotic\nought to be absurdly grateful for what is flung to them, and heaven\nis gained in the throwing. In this way the rich inevitably become the\nelect, both here and hereafter, and the needle's eye is widened into a\ngap.\"\n\nThere was on Mr. Parr's lips a smile not wholly pleasant to see. Indeed,\nin the last few minutes there had been revealed to Hodder a side of\nthe banker's character which had escaped him in the two years of their\nacquaintance.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Mr. Parr, slowly, drumming on the table, \"you would\nsay that of the new settlement house of St. John's, whereby we hope to\nraise a whole neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"Yes, I should,\" replied Alison, with spirit. \"The social system by\nwhich you thrive, and which politically and financially you strive to\nmaintain, is diametrically opposed to your creed, which is supposed to\nbe the brotherhood of man. But if that were really your creed, you would\nwork for it politically and financially. You would see that your Church\nis trying to do infinitesimally what the government, but for your\nopposition, might do universally. Your true creed is the survival of\nthe fittest. You grind these people down into what is really an economic\nslavery and dependence, and then you insult and degrade them by inviting\nthem to exercise and read books and sing hymns in your settlement\nhouse, and give their children crackers and milk and kindergartens and\nsunlight! I don't blame them for not becoming Christians on that basis.\nWhy, the very day I left New York a man over eighty, who had been\nswindled out of all he had, rather than go to one of those Christian\ninstitutions deliberately forged a check and demanded to be sent to\nthe penitentiary. He said he could live and die there with some\nself-respect.\"\n\n\"I might have anticipated that you would ultimately become a Socialist,\nAlison,\" Mr. Parr remarked--but his voice trembled.\n\n\"I don't know whether I'm a Socialist or an Anarchist,\" she answered.\nHodder thought he detected a note of hopelessness in her voice, and the\nspirit in it ebbed a little. Not only did she seem indifferent to her\nfather's feeling--which incidentally added fuel to it--but her splendid\ndisregard of him, as a clergyman, had made an oddly powerful appeal.\nAnd her argument! His feelings, as he listened to this tremendous\narraignment of Eldon Parr by his daughter, are not easily to be\ndescribed. To say that she had compelled him, the rector of St. John's,\nat last to look in the face many conditions which he had refused to\nrecognize would be too definite a statement. Nevertheless, some such\nthing had occurred. Refutations sprang to his lips, and died there,\nthough he had no notion of uttering them. He saw that to admit her\ncontentions would be to behold crumble into ruins the structure that he\nhad spent a life in rearing; and yet something within him responded to\nher words--they had the passionate, convincing ring of truth.\n\nBy no means the least of their disturbing effects was due to the fact\nthat they came as a climax to, as a fulfilment of the revelation he had\nhad at the Fergusons', when something of the true nature of Mr. Plimpton\nand others of his congregation had suddenly been laid bare. And now\nHodder looked at Eldon Parr to behold another man from the one he had\nknown, and in that moment realized that their relationship could never\nagain be the same... Were his sympathies with the daughter?\n\n\"I don't know what I believe,\" said Alison, after a pause. \"I've ceased\ntrying to find out. What's the use!\" She appeared now to be addressing\nno one in particular.\n\nA servant entered with a card, and the banker's hand shook perceptibly\nas he put down his claret and adjusted his glasses.\n\n\"Show him into my office upstairs, and tell him I'll see him at once,\"\nhe said, and glanced at the rector. But it was Alison whom he addressed.\n\"I must leave Mr. Hodder to answer your arguments,\" he added, with an\nattempt at lightness; and then to the rector: \"Perhaps you can convince\nher that the Church is more sinned against than sinning, and that\nChristians are not such terrible monsters after all. You'll excuse me?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" Hodder had risen.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\"Shall we have coffee in the garden?\" Alison asked. \"It's much nicer\noutside this time of year.\"\n\nFor an instant he was at a loss to decide whether to accede, or to make\nan excuse and leave the house. Wisdom seemed to point to flight.\nBut when he glanced at her he saw to his surprise that the mood\nof abstraction into which she had fallen still held her; that the\ndiscussion which had aroused Eldon Parr to such dramatic anger had left\nher serious and thoughtful. She betrayed no sense of triumph at having\naudaciously and successfully combated him, and she appeared now only\npartially to be aware of Hodder's presence. His interest, his curiosity\nmounted suddenly again, overwhelming once more the antagonism which\nhe had felt come and go in waves; and once more his attempted\nclassification of her was swept away. She had relapsed into an enigma.\n\n\"I like the open air,\" he answered, \"and I have always wished to see the\ngarden. I have admired it from the windows.\"\n\n\"It's been on my mind for some years,\" she replied, as she led the way\ndown a flight of steps into the vine-covered pergola. \"And I intend to\nchange parts of it while I am out here. It was one of my first attempts,\nand I've learned more since.\"\n\n\"You must forgive my ignorant praise,\" he said, and smiled. \"I have\nalways thought it beautiful: But I can understand that an artist is\nnever satisfied.\"\n\nShe turned to him, and suddenly their eyes met and held in a momentary,\nelectric intensity that left him warm and agitated. There was nothing\ncoquettish in the glance, but it was the first distinct manifestation\nthat he was of consequence. She returned his smile, without levity.\n\n\"Is a clergyman ever satisfied?\" she asked.\n\n\"He ought not to be,\" replied Hodder, wondering whether she had read\nhim.\n\n\"Although you were so considerate, I suppose you must have thought it\npresumptuous of me to criticize your profession, which is religion.\"\n\n\"Religion, I think, should be everybody's,\" he answered quietly.\n\nShe made no reply. And he entered, as into another world, the circular\narbour in which the pergola ended, so complete in contrast was its\natmosphere to that of the house. The mansion he had long since grown\nto recognize as an expression of the personality of its owner, but this\nclassic bower was as remote from it as though it were in Greece. He\nwas sensitive to beauty, yet the beauty of the place had a perplexing\nquality, which he felt in the perfect curves of the marble bench, in\nthe marble basin brimming to the tip with clear water,--the surface\nof which, flecked with pink petals, mirrored the azure sky through the\nleafy network of the roof. In one green recess a slender Mercury hastily\nadjusted his sandal.\n\nWas this, her art, the true expression of her baffling personality? As\nshe had leaned back in the corner of the automobile she had given\nhim the impression of a languor almost Oriental, but this had been\nstartlingly dispelled at the lunch-table by the revelation of an\nanimation and a vitality which had magically transformed her. But now,\nas under the spell of a new encompassment of her own weaving, she seemed\nto revert to her former self, sinking, relaxed, into a wicker lounge\nbeside the basin, one long and shapely hand in the water, the other idle\nin her lap. Her eyes, he remarked, were the contradiction in her face.\nHad they been larger, and almond-shaped, the illusion might have been\ncomplete. They were neither opaque nor smouldering,--but Western eyes,\namber-coloured, with delicately stencilled rays and long lashes. And as\nthey gazed up at him now they seemed to reflect, without disclosing\nthe flitting thoughts behind them. He felt antagonism and attraction in\nalmost equal degree--the situation transcended his experience.\n\n\"You don't intend to change this?\" he asked, with an expressive sweep of\nhis hand.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"I've always liked it. Tell me what you feel about it.\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"You resent it,\" she declared.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" he demanded quickly.\n\n\"I feel it,\" she answered calmly, but with a smile.\n\n\"'Resent' would scarcely be the proper word,\" he contended, returning\nher smile, yet hesitating again.\n\n\"You think it pagan,\" she told him.\n\n\"Perhaps I do,\" he answered simply, as though impressed by her\nfelicitous discovery of the adjective.\n\nAlison laughed.\n\n\"It's pagan because I'm pagan, I suppose.\"\n\n\"It's very beautiful--you have managed to get an extraordinary\natmosphere,\" he continued, bent on doing himself an exact justice. \"But I\nshould say, if you pressed me, that it represents to me the deification\nof beauty to the exclusion of all else. You have made beauty the Alpha\nand Omega.\"\n\n\"There is nothing else for me,\" she said.\n\nThe coffee-tray arrived and was deposited on a wicker table beside her.\nShe raised herself on an elbow, filled his cup and handed it to him.\n\n\"And yet,\" he persisted, \"from the manner in which you spoke at the\ntable--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't imagine I haven't thought? But thinking isn't--believing.\"\n\n\"No,\" he admitted, with a touch of sadness, \"you are right. There were\ncertain comments you made on the Christian religion--\"\n\nShe interrupted him again.\n\n\"As to the political side of it, which is Socialism, so far as I can\nsee. If there is any other side, I have never been able to discover\nit. It seems to me that if Christians were logical, they should be\nSocialists. The brotherhood of man, cooperation--all that is Socialism,\nisn't it? It's opposed to the principle of the survival of the fittest,\nwhich so many of these so-called Christians practise. I used to think,\nwhen I came back from Paris, that I was a Socialist, and I went to a lot\nof their meetings in New York, and to lectures. But after a while I saw\nthere was something in Socialism that didn't appeal to me, something\nsmothering,--a forced cooperation that did not leave one free. I wanted\nto be free, I've been striving all my life to be free,\" she exclaimed\npassionately, and was silent an instant, inspecting him. \"Perhaps I\nowe you an apology for speaking as I did before a clergyman--especially\nbefore an honest one.\"\n\nHe passed over the qualification with a characteristic smile.\n\n\"Oh, if we are going to shut our ears to criticism we'd better give\nup being clergymen,\" he answered. \"I'm afraid there is a great deal of\ntruth in what you said.\"\n\n\"That's generous of you!\" she exclaimed, and thrilled him with the\ntribute. Nor was the tribute wholly in the words: there had come\nspontaneously into her voice an exquisite, modulated note that haunted\nhim long after it had died away....\n\n\"I had to say what I thought,\" she continued earnestly; \"I stood it\nas long as I could. Perhaps you didn't realize it, but my father\nwas striking at me when he referred to your sermon, and spiritual\ncontrol--and in other things he said when you were talking about the\nsettlement-house. He reserves for himself the right to do as he pleases,\nbut insists that those who surround him shall adopt the subserviency\nwhich he thinks proper for the rest of the world. If he were a Christian\nhimself, I shouldn't mind it so much.\"\n\nHodder was silent. The thought struck him with the force of a great\nwind.\n\n\"He's a Pharisee,\" Alison went on, following the train of her thought.\n\"I remember the first time I discovered that--it was when I was reading\nthe New Testament carefully, in the hope of finding something in\nChristianity I might take hold of. And I was impressed particularly by\nthe scorn with which Christ treated the Pharisees. My father, too, if he\nhad lived in those days, would have thought Christ a seditious person,\nan impractical, fanatical idealist, and would have tried to trip him\nup with literal questions concerning the law. His real and primary\ninterest--is in a social system that benefits himself and his kind,\nand because this is so, he, and men like him, would have it appear that\nChristianity is on the side of what they term law and order. I do not\nsay that they are hypocritical, that they reason this out. They are\nelemental; and they feel intuitively that Christianity contains a vital\nspark which, if allowed to fly, would start a conflagration beyond their\ncontrol. The theologians have helped them to cover the spark with ashes,\nand naturally they won't allow the ashes to be touched, if they can help\nit.\"\n\nShe lay very still.\n\nThe rector had listened to her, at first with amazement, then with\nmore complicated sensations as she thus dispassionately discussed the\nforemost member of his congregation and the first layman of the diocese,\nwho was incidentally her own father. In her masterly analysis of Eldon\nParr, she had brought Hodder face to face with the naked truth, and\ncompelled him to recognize it. How could he attempt to refute it, with\nhonesty?\n\nHe remembered Mr. Parr's criticism of Alison. There had been hardness in\nthat, though it were the cry of a lacerated paternal affection. In that,\ntoo, a lack of comprehension, an impotent anger at a visitation not\nunderstood, a punishment apparently unmerited. Hodder had pitied him\nthen--he still pitied him. In the daughter's voice was no trace of\nresentment. No one, seemingly, could be farther removed from him (the\nrector of St. John's) in her opinions and views of life, than Allison\nParr; and yet he felt in her an undercurrent, deep and strong, which\nmoved him strangely, strongly, irresistibly; he recognized a passionate\ndesire for the truth, and the courage to face it at any cost, and a\ncapacity for tenderness, revealed in flashes.\n\n\"I have hurt you,\" she exclaimed. \"I am sorry.\"\n\nHe collected himself.\n\n\"It is not you who have hurt me,\" he replied. \"Reflections on the\ncontradictions and imperfections of life are always painful. And since I\nhave been here, I have seen a great deal of your father.\"\n\n\"You are fond of him!\"\n\nHe hesitated. It was not an ordinary conversation they were dealing with\nrealities, and he had a sense that vital issues were at stake. He\nhad, in that moment, to make a revaluation of his sentiments for the\nfinancier--to weigh the effect of her indictment.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered slowly, \"I am fond of him. He has shown me a side of\nhimself, perhaps, that other men have not seen,--and he is very lonely.\"\n\n\"You pity him.\" He started at her word. \"I guessed that from an\nexpression that crossed your face when we were at the table. But surely\nyou must have observed the incongruity of his relationship with\nyour Church! Surely, in preaching as you did this morning against\nmaterialism, individualism, absorption in the pursuit of wealth, you\nmust have had my father in mind as the supreme example! And yet he\nlistened to you as serenely as though he had never practised any of\nthese things!\n\n\"Clergymen wonder why Christianity doesn't make more progress to-day;\nwell, what strikes the impartial observer who thinks about the subject\nat all, as one reason, is the paralyzing inconsistency of an alliance\nbetween those who preach the brotherhood of man and those who are\nopposed to it. I've often wondered what clergymen would say about it, if\nthey were frank--only I never see any clergymen.\"\n\nHe was strongly agitated. He did not stop--strangely enough--to reflect\nhow far they had gone, to demand by what right she brought him to the\nbar, challenged the consistency of his life. For she had struck, with\na ruthless precision, at the very core of his trouble, revealed it for\nwhat it was.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I can see how we may be accused of inconsistency, and\nwith much justice.\"\n\nHis refusal to excuse and vindicate himself impressed her as no attempt\nat extenuation could have done. Perhaps, in that moment, her quick\ninstinct divined something of his case, something of the mental\nsuffering he strove to conceal. Contrition shone in her eyes.\n\n\"I ought not to have said that,\" she exclaimed gently. \"It is so easy\nfor outsiders to criticize those who are sincere--and I am sure you are.\nWe cannot know all the perplexities. But when we look at the Church, we\nare puzzled by that--which I have mentioned--and by other things.\"\n\n\"What other things?\" he demanded.\n\nShe hesitated in her turn.\n\n\"I suppose you think it odd, my having gone to church, feeling as I do,\"\nshe said. \"But St. John's is now the only place vividly associated with\nmy mother. She was never at home here, in this house. I always go at\nleast once when I am out here. And I listened to your sermon intently.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I wanted to tell you this: you interested me as I had not been\ninterested since I was twenty, when I made a desperate attempt to become\na Christian--and failed. Do you know how you struck me? It was as a\nman who actually had a great truth which he was desperately trying to\nimpart, and could not. I have not been in a church more than a dozen\ntimes in the last eight years, but you impressed me as a man who felt\nsomething--whatever it is.\"\n\nHe did not speak.\n\n\"But why,\" she cried, \"do you insist on what you cell authority? As\na modern woman who has learned to use her own mind, I simply can't\nbelieve, if the God of the universe is the moral God you assert him to\nbe, that he has established on earth an agency of the kind you infer,\nand delegated to it the power of life and death over human souls.\nPerhaps you do not go so far, but if you make the claim at all you must\nmake it in its entirety. There is an idea of commercialism, of monopoly\nin that conception which is utterly repugnant to any one who tries to\napproach the subject with a fresh mind, and from an ideal point of view.\nAnd religion must be idealism--mustn't it?\n\n\"Your ancient monks and saints weren't satisfied until they had settled\nevery detail of the invisible world, of the past and future. They\nmapped it out as if it were a region they had actually explored, like\ngeographers. They used their reason, and what science they had, to make\ntheories about it which the churches still proclaim as the catholic and\nfinal truth. You forbid us to use our reason. You declare, in order to\nbecome Christians, that we have to accept authoritative statements. Oh,\ncan't you see that an authoritative statement is just what an ethical\nperson doesn't want? Belief--faith doesn't consist in the mere\nacceptance of a statement, but in something much higher--if we can\nachieve it. Acceptance of authority is not faith, it is mere credulity,\nit is to shirk the real issue. We must believe, if we believe at all,\nwithout authority. If we knew, there would be no virtue in striving. If\nI choose a God,\" she added, after a pause, \"I cannot take a consensus of\nopinion about him,--he must be my God.\"\n\nHodder did not speak immediately. Strange as it may seem, he had\nnever heard the argument, and the strength of it, reenforced by the\nextraordinary vitality and earnestness of the woman who had uttered it,\nhad a momentary stunning effect. He sat contemplating her as she lay\nback among the cushions, and suddenly he seemed to see in her the\nrebellious child of which her father had spoken. No wonder Eldon Parr\nhad misunderstood her, had sought to crush her spirit! She was to be\ndealt with in no common way, nor was the consuming yearning he discerned\nin her to be lightly satisfied.\n\n\"The God of the individualist,\" he said at length--musingly, not\naccusingly.\n\n\"I am an individualist,\" she admitted simply. \"But I am at least logical\nin that philosophy, and the individualists who attend the churches\nto-day are not. The inconsistency of their lives is what makes those\nof us who do not go to church doubt the efficacy of their creed, which\nseems to have no power to change them. The majority of people in St.\nJohn's are no more Christians than I am. They attend service once a\nweek, and the rest of the time they are bent upon getting all they can\nof pleasure and profit for themselves. Do you wonder that those who\nconsider this spectacle come inevitably to the conclusion that either\nChristianity is at fault, is outworn, or else that it is presented in\nthe wrong way?\"\n\nThe rector rose abruptly, walked to the entrance of the arbour, and\nstood staring out across the garden. Presently he turned and came back\nand stood over her.\n\n\"Since you ask me,\" he said slowly, \"I do not wonder at it.\"\n\nShe raised her eyes swiftly.\n\n\"When you speak like that,\" she exclaimed with an enthusiasm that\nstirred him, despite the trouble of his mind, \"I cannot think of you as\na clergyman,--but as a man. Indeed,\" she added, in the surprise of her\ndiscovery, \"I have never thought of you as a clergyman--even when I\nfirst saw you this morning. I could not account then for a sense of\nduality about you that puzzled me. Do you always preach as earnestly as\nthat?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I felt as if you were throwing your whole soul into the effort-=oh,\nI felt it distinctly. You made some of them, temporarily, a little\nuncomfortable, but they do not understand you, and you didn't change\nthem. It seemed to me you realized this when Gordon Atterbury spoke\nto you. I tried to analyze the effect on myself--if it had been in the\nslightest degree possible for my reason to accept what you said you\nmight, through sheer personality, have compelled me to reconsider. As it\nwas, I found myself resisting you.\"\n\nWith his hands clasped behind him, he paced across the arbour and back\nagain.\n\n\"Have you ever definitely and sincerely tried to put what the Church\nteaches into practice?\" he asked.\n\n\"Orthodox Christianity? penance, asceticism,\nself-abnegation--repression--falling on my knees and seeking a\nforgiveness out of all proportion to the trespass, and filled with a\nsense of total depravity? If I did that I should lose myself--the only\nvaluable thing I've got.\"\n\nHodder, who had resumed his pacing, glanced at her involuntarily, and\nfought an inclination to agree with her.\n\n\"I see no one upon whom I can rely but myself,\" she went on with the\nextraordinary energy she was able to summon at will, \"and I am\nconvinced that self-sacrifice--at least, indiscriminate, unreasoning\nself-sacrifice--is worse than useless, and to teach it is criminal\nignorance. None of the so-called Christian virtues appeals to me: I hate\nhumility. You haven't it. The only happiness I can see in the world\nlies in self-expression, and I certainly shouldn't find that in sewing\ngarments for the poor.\n\n\"The last thing that I could wish for would be immortality as orthodox\nChristianity depicts it! And suppose I had followed the advice of my\nChristian friends and remained here, where they insisted my duty was,\nwhat would have happened to me? In a senseless self-denial I should\ngradually have, withered into a meaningless old maid, with no opinions\nof my own, and no more definite purpose in life than to write checks for\ncharities. Your Christianity commands that women shall stay at home, and\ndeclares that they are not entitled to seek their own salvation, to\nhave any place in affairs, or to meddle with the realm of the intellect.\nThose forbidden gardens are reserved for the lordly sex. St. Paul, you\nsay, put us in our proper place some twenty centuries ago, and we are to\nremain there for all time.\"\n\nHe felt sweeping through him the reverse current of hostility.\n\n\"And what I preach,\" he asked, \"has tended to confirm you in such a mean\nconception of Christianity?\"\n\nHer eye travelled over the six feet of him--the kindling, reflecting\neye of the artist; it rested for a moment on the protesting locks of his\nhair, which apparently could not be cut short enough to conform; on the\nhands, which were strong and sinewy; on the wide, tolerant mouth, with\nits rugged furrows, on the breadth and height of the forehead. She lay\nfor a moment, inert, considering.\n\n\"What you preach--yes,\" she answered, bravely meeting his look. \"What\nyou are--no. You and your religion are as far apart as the poles. Oh,\nthis old argument, the belief that has been handed down to the man, the\nauthority with which he is clothed, and not the man himself! How can one\nbe a factor in life unless one represents something which is the fruit\nof actual, personal experience? Your authority is for the weak, the\ntimid, the credulous,--for those who do not care to trust themselves,\nwho run for shelter from the storms of life to a 'papier-mache'\nfortress, made to look like rock. In order to preach that logically you\nshould be a white ascetic, with a well-oiled manner, a downcast look\nlest you stumble in your pride; lest by chance you might do something\noriginal that sprang out of your own soul instead of being an imitation\nof the saints. And if your congregation took your doctrine literally,\nI can see a whole army of white, meek Christians. But you are not like\nthat. Can't you see it for yourself?\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Can't you feel that you are an individual, a personality, a force that\nmight be put to great uses? That will be because you are open-minded,\nbecause there is room in you for growth and change?\"\n\nHe strove with all his might to quell the inner conflagration which she\nhad fanned into leaping flames. Though he had listened before to doubt\nand criticism, this woman, with her strange shifting moods of calm and\npassion, with her bewildering faculty of changing from passive to active\nresistance, her beauty (once manifest, never to be forgotten), her\nunique individuality that now attracted, now repelled, seemed for\nthe moment the very incarnation of the forces opposed to him and his\nreligion. Holder, as he looked at her, had a flash of fierce resentment\nthat now, of all times, she should suddenly have flung herself across\nhis path. For she was to be reckoned with. Why did he not tell her she\nwas an egoist? Why didn't he speak out, defend his faith, denounce her\nviews as prejudiced and false?\n\n\"Have I made you angry?\" he heard her say. \"I am sorry.\"\n\nIt was the hint of reproach in her tone to which the man in him\ninstantly responded. And what he saw now was his portrait she had\npainted. The thought came to him: was he indeed greater, more vital than\nthe religion he professed? God forbid! Did he ring true, and it false?\n\nShe returned his gaze. And gradually, under her clear olive skin, he saw\nthe crimson colour mounting higher.... She put forth her hand, simply,\nnaturally, and pressed his own, as though they had been friends for a\nlifetime....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE MESSENGER IN THE CHURCH\n\n\nI\n\nThe annual scourge of summer had descended pitilessly upon the city once\nmore, enervating, depressing, stagnating, and people moved languidly\nin the penetrating heat that steamed from the pores of the surrounding\nriver bottoms.\n\nThe rector of St. John's realized that a crisis had come in his life,--a\ncrisis he had tried to stave off in vain. And yet there was a period\nduring which he pursued his shrunken duties as though nothing had\nhappened to him; as a man who has been struck in battle keeps on,\nloath to examine, to acknowledge the gravity of his wound; fearing to,\nperhaps. Sometimes, as his mind went back to the merciless conflict of\nhis past, his experience at the law school, it was the unchaining of\nthat other man he dreaded, the man he believed himself to have\nfinally subdued. But night and day he was haunted by the sorrowful and\nreproachful face of Truth.\n\nHad he the courage, now, to submit the beliefs which had sustained him\nall these years to Truth's inexorable inspection? Did he dare to turn\nand open those books which she had inspired,--the new philosophies, the\nhistorical criticisms which he had neglected and condemned, which he\nhad flattered himself he could do without,--and read of the fruit\nof Knowledge? Twice, thrice he had hesitated on the steps of the big\nlibrary, and turned away with a wildly beating heart.\n\nDay by day the storm increased, until from a cloud on the horizon it\ngrew into a soul-shaking tempest. Profoundly moved Parr's he had been\non that Sunday afternoon, in Eldon Parr's garden, he had resolutely\nresolved to thrust the woman and the incident from his mind, to defer\nthe consideration of the questions she had raised--grave though they\nwere--to a calmer period. For now he was unable to separate her, to\neliminate the emotion--he was forced to acknowledge--the thought of her\naroused, from the problems themselves. Who was she? At moments he seemed\nto see her shining, accusing, as Truth herself, and again as a Circe\nwho had drawn him by subtle arts from his wanderings, luring him to his\ndeath; or, at other times, as the mutinous daughter of revolt. But when\nhe felt, in memory, the warm touch of her hand, the old wildness of his\nnature responded, he ceased to speculate or care, and he longed only to\ncrush and subdue her by the brute power of the man in him. For good or\nbad, she had woven her spell.\n\nHere was the old, elemental, twofold contest, carnal and spiritual,\nthoroughly revived!...\n\nHe recalled, in his musings, the little theological school surrounded\nby southern woods and fields, where he had sometime walked under autumn\nfoliage with the elderly gentleman who had had such an influence on\nhis life--the dean. Mild-mannered and frail, patient in ordinary\nconverse,--a lion for the faith. He would have died for it as cheerfully\nas any martyr in history. By the marvels of that faith Holder had\nbeheld, from his pew in the chapel, the little man transformed. He knew\nyoung men, their perplexities and temptations, and he dealt with them\npersonally, like a father. Holder's doubts were stilled, he had gained\npower of his temptations and peace for his soul, and he had gone forth\ninspired by the reminder that there was no student of whom the dean\nexpected better things. Where now were the thousands of which he had\ndreamed, and which he was to have brought into the Church?...\n\nNow, he asked himself, was it the dean, or the dean's theology through\nwhich his regeneration had come? Might not the inherent goodness of the\ndean be one thing, and his theology quite another? Personality again!\nHe recalled one of the many things which Alison Parr had branded on his\nmemory,--\"the belief, the authority in which the man is clothed, and\nnot the man!\" The dean's God had remained silent on the subject of\npersonality. Or, at the best, he had not encouraged it; and there\nwere--Hodder could not but perceive--certain contradictions in his\ncharacter, which were an anomalistic blending of that of the jealous God\nof Moses and of the God of Christ. There must be continuity--God could\nnot change. Therefore the God of infinite love must retain the wrath\nwhich visited sins of the fathers on the children, which demanded\nsacrifice, atonement,--an exact propitiation for his anger against\nmankind. An innocent life of sorrow and suffering!\n\nAnd again, \"You and your religion are as far apart as the poles!\" Had\nhe, Hodder, outgrown the dean's religion, or had it ever been his own?\nWas there, after all, such a thing as religion? Might it not be merely a\nfigment of the fertile imagination of man? He did not escape the terror\nof this thought when he paused to consider his labour of the past two\nyears and the vanity of its results. And little by little the feeling\ngrew upon him, such being the state of his mind, that he ought not to\ncontinue, for the present at least, to conduct the services. Should he\nresign, or go away for a while to some quiet place before he made such\na momentous decision? There was no one to whom he could turn; no layman,\nand no clergyman; not even the old bishop, whom he had more than once\nmentally accused of being, too broad and too tolerant! No, he did not\nwish a clergyman's solution. The significance of this thought flashed\nthrough him--that the world itself was no longer seeking clergymen's\nsolutions. He must go off alone, and submit his faith to the impartial\ntest.\n\nIt was in a vigil of the night, when he lay in the hot darkness, unable\nto sleep, that he came at length to this resolve. And now that he had\ncut the knot he was too just to blame Alison Parr for having pointed\nout--with what often had seemed a pitiless cruelty--something of which\nhe had had a constantly growing perception yet had continually sought to\nevade. And he reviewed, as the church bells recorded the silent hours,\nhow, little by little, his confidence had crumbled before the shocks of\nthe successive revelations--some of them so slight that they had\npassed unnoticed: comparisons, inevitably compelled; Dalton Street; the\nconfessions of Eleanor Goodrich and Mrs. Constable; Mr. Plimpton and his\nviews of life--Eldon Parr! Even the slamming of the carriage doors in\nBurton Street had had a significance!\n\nMight it not prove that this woman had let fall into the turbid waters\nof his soul the drop that was to clear them forever? He would go away.\nHe would not see her again.\n\nOver the sleeping city, unapprehended, stole the dawn.\n\nHe arose, but instead of falling on his knees he went to the window and\nlifted his face to the whitening sky.... Slowly out of the obscurity of\nthe earth's shadow emerged the vague outlines of familiar things\nuntil they stood sharply material, in a silence as of death. A sparrow\ntwittered, and suddenly the familiar, soot-grimed roofs were bathed in\nlight, and by a touch made beautiful....\n\nSome hours later the city was wide awake. And Hodder, bathed and\ndressed, stood staring down from his study window into the street below,\nfull now of young men and girls; some with set faces, hurrying, intent,\nothers romping and laughing as they dodged the trucks and trolley cars;\nall on their way to the great shoe factory around the corner, the huge\nfunnels of which were belching forth smoke into the morning air.\nThe street emptied, a bell rang, a whistle blew, the hum of distant\nmachinery began....\n\n\n\nII\n\nLater that morning Hodder sat in his study. The shutters were closed,\nand the intensity of the tropical glare without was softened and\ndiffused by the slanting green slats. His eye wandered over the long and\ncomfortable room which had been his sanctuary in the feverish days of\nhis ministry, resting affectionately on the hospitable chairs, the wide\nfireplace before which he had been wont to settle himself on winter\nnights, and even on the green matting--a cooling note in summer. And\nthere, in the low cases along the walls, were the rows of his precious\nbooks,--his one hobby and extravagance. He had grown to love the room.\nWould he ever come back to it?\n\nA step sounded in the hall, a knock, and the well-known gaunt form and\nspectacled face of McCrae appeared in the doorway.\n\n\"Ye wished to see me?\" he asked.\n\n\"McCrae,\" said the rector, \"I am going off for a while.\"\n\nHis assistant regarded him a moment in silence. Although Hodder had no\nintention of explaining his reasons, he had a curious conviction that it\nwere superfluous to do so, that McCrae had guessed them.\n\n\"Why shouldn't ye? There's but a handful left to preach to in this\nweather.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't go, in this sudden way, if it were not imperative,\" Hodder\nadded, trying to speak calmly.\n\n\"Why shouldn't ye?\" McCrae repeated, almost fiercely.\n\nHodder smiled in spite of himself.\n\n\"There's no reason,\" he said, \"except the added work put on you without\nwarning, and in this heat.\"\n\n\"Ye'll not need to worry,\" his assistant assured him, \"the heat's\nnothing to me.\" McCrae hesitated, and then demanded abruptly, \"Ye'll not\nbe visiting?\"\n\nThe question took Hodder by surprise.\n\n\"No,\" he answered quickly, and not quite steadily, and hesitated in his\nturn, \"I shan't be visiting.\"\n\n\"It's a rest ye need, I've been wanting to say it.\" McCrae took a step\nforward, and for a moment it seemed as though he were at last about\nto break the bonds of his reserve. Perhaps he detected an instinctive\nshrinking on the rector's part. At any rate, there was another instant\nof silence, in which the two men faced each other across the desk, and\nMcCrae held out his hand. \"Good luck to ye,\" he said, as Hodder took\nit, \"and don't have the pariah on your mind. Stay till ye're rested, and\ncome back to us.\"\n\nHe left the room abruptly. Hodder remained motionless, looking after\nhim, and then, moved apparently by a sudden impulse, started toward the\ndoor,--only to halt and turn before he got to it. Almost he had opened\nhis lips to call his assistant back. He could not do it--the moment had\ncome and fled when it might have been possible. Did this man hide, under\nhis brusqueness and brevity of speech, the fund of wisdom and the wider\nsympathy and understanding he suspected? Hodder could have vouched for\nit, and yet he had kept his own counsel. And he was struck suddenly by\nthe significance of the fact, often remarked, that McCrae in his brief\nand common-sense and by no means enlivening sermons had never once\nreferred in any way to doctrine or dogma!\n\nHe spent half an hour in collecting and bestowing in two large valises\nsuch articles as his simple needs would demand, and then set out for a\nrailroad office in the business portion of the city, where he bought his\nticket and berth. Then, after a moment of irresolution on the threshold\nof the place, he turned to the right, thrusting his way through the\nsluggish crowds on Tower Street until he came to the large bookstore\nwhere he had been want to spend, from time to time, some of his leisure\nmoments. A clerk recognized him, and was about to lead the way to the\nrear, where the precious editions were kept, when Hodder stopped him.\n\nIn casting about for a beginning in his venture over unknown seas, there\nhad naturally come into his mind three or four works which were anathema\nto the orthodox; one of which, in seven volumes, went back to his\nseminary days, and had been the subject of a ringing, denunciatory\nsermon by the dean himself. Three of them were by Germans of established\nreputations, another by a professor of the University of Paris. The\nhabit of years is strong.\n\nAnd though he knew that many clergymen read these books, Hodder found it\nimpossible to overcome a nervous sense of adventure,--nay (knowing his\nresolution), of apostasy, almost of clandestine guilt when he mentioned\nthem. And it seemed to him that the face of the clerk betrayed surprise.\nOne of the works was not in stock; he would send the others that\nafternoon. Mr. Hodder would take them? They made a formidable parcel,\nbut a little handle was supplied and the rector hurried out, swinging\nhimself on a Tower Street car.\n\nIt must not be thought that the whole of what is called modern criticism\nwas new to Hodder. This would indeed be too much of a reflection on\nthe open-mindedness of the seminary from which he had graduated. But\nhe found himself, now, pondering a little cynically on that\n\"open-mindedness\"; on that concession--if it had been a concession--to\nthe methods of science. There had been in truth a course of lectures on\nthis subject; but he saw now, very clearly, what a concerted effort had\nbeen put forward in the rest of the teaching to minimize and discredit\nit. Even the professor who gave the lectures had had the air of\ndeploring them. Here it is, but on the whole one would better let it\nalone,--such was the inference. And he had let it alone, through all\nthese years.\n\nIn the seminary, too, volumes by semi-learned clergymen had been thrust\ninto his hands, efforts which Hodder recalled now, in spite of his\nmental state, with a smile. These invariably championed the doctrine\nof the virgin birth as the pillar on which the Incarnation depended. A\nfavourite argument declared that although the Gospel texts in regard\nto it might be proven untrustworthy, the miraculous birth must have\nhappened anyway! And one of these clerical authors whom he had more\nrecently read, actually had had the audacity to turn the weapons of\nthe archenemy, science, back upon itself. The virgin birth was an\nestablished fact in nature, and had its place in the social economy of\nthe bee. And did not parthenogenesis occur in the silk moth?\n\nIn brief, the conclusion impressed upon him by his seminary instruction\nwas this: that historical criticism had corrected some ideas and put\nsome things in their right place. What these things were remained\nsufficiently vague. But whenever it attacked a cherished dogma it was,\non general principles, wrong.\n\nOnce again in his cool study, he cut the cord with a trembling hand, and\nwhile he was eating the lunch his housekeeper had prepared, dipped into\none of the larger volumes. As he read again the critical disproofs he\nfelt an acute, almost physical pain, as though a vital part of him were\nbeing cut away, as his mind dwelt upon those beautiful legends to which\nhe had so often turned, and which had seemed the very fountain of his\nfaith. Legends!....\n\nHe closed the book. The clock on the mantel struck three; his train was\nto leave at five. He rose and went down into the silent church he had\ngrown to love, seating himself in one of the carved stalls of the choir,\nhis eye lingering in turn on each beautiful object: on the glowing\nlandscape in the window in memory of Eliza Parr, portraying the\ndelectable country, with the bewildered yet enraptured faces of the\npilgrims in the foreground; on the graceful, shining lectern, the\naspiring arches, the carved marble altar behind the rail, and above it\nthe painting of the Christ on the cross.\n\nThe hours of greatest suffering are the empty hours. 'Eloi, Eloi, lama\nsabachthani?' The hours when the mysterious sustaining and driving force\nis withdrawn, and a lassitude and despair comes over us like that of\na deserted child: the hours when we feel we have reached the limit of\nservice, when our brief span of usefulness is done. Had God brought him,\nJohn Hodder, to the height of the powers of his manhood only to abandon\nhim, to cast him adrift on the face of the waters--led him to this great\nparish, with all its opportunities, only that he might fail and flee?\n\nHe sat staring at the face of the Man on the cross. Did he, in his\noverwrought state, imagine there an expression he had never before\nremarked, or had the unknown artist of the seventies actually risen\nabove the mediocrity of the figure in his portrayal of the features of\nthe Christ? The rector started, and stared again. There was no weakness\nin the face, no meekness, no suggestion of the conception of the\nsacrificed Lamb, no hint of a beatific vision of opening heavens--and\nyet no accusation, no despair. A knowing--that were nearer--a knowing of\nall things through the experiencing of all things, the suffering of all\nthings. For suffering without revelation were vain, indeed! A perfected\nwisdom that blended inevitably with a transcendent love. Love and wisdom\nwere one, then? To reach comprehension through conquering experience was\nto achieve the love that could exclaim, \"they know not what they do!\"\n\nHuman or divine? Man or God? Hodder found himself inwardly repeating the\nwords, the controversy which had raged for nineteen hundred years, and\nnot yet was stilled. Perfection is divine. Human! Hodder repeated the\nword, as one groping on the threshold of a great discovery....\n\n\n\nIII\n\nHe was listening--he had for a long time been listening to a sound which\nhad seemed only the natural accompaniment of the drama taking place in\nhis soul, as though some inspired organist were expressing in exquisite\nmusic the undercurrent of his agony. Only gradually did he become aware\nthat it arose from the nave of the church, and, turning, his eyes fell\nupon the bowed head and shoulders of a woman kneeling in one of the\npews. She was sobbing.\n\nHis movement, he recalled afterward, did not come of a conscious\nvolition, as he rose and descended the chancel steps and walked toward\nher; he stood for what seemed a long time on the white marble of the\naisle looking down on her, his heart wrung by the violence of her grief,\nwhich at moments swept through her like a tempest. She seemed still\nyoung, but poverty had marked her with unmistakable signs. The white,\nblue-veined hands that clung to the railing of the pew were thin; and\nthe shirtwaist, though clean, was cheap and frayed. At last she rose\nfrom her knees and raised a tear-stained face to his, staring at him in\na dumb bewilderment.\n\n\"Can I do anything for you?\" he said gently, \"I am the rector here.\" She\ndid not answer, but continued to stare uncomprehendingly. He sat down\nbeside her in the pew.\n\n\"You are in trouble,\" he said. \"Will you let me try to help you?\" A sob\nshook her--the beginning of a new paroxysm. He waited patiently until it\nwas over. Suddenly she got rather wildly and unsteadily to her feet.\n\n\"I must go!\" she cried. \"Oh, God, what would I do if--if he wasn't\nthere?\"\n\nHodder rose too. She had thrust herself past him into the aisle, but if\nhe had not taken her arm she would have fallen. Thus they went together\nto the door of the church, and out into the white, burning sunlight. In\nspite of her weakness she seemed actually to be leading him, impelled\nby a strange force and fled down the steps of the porch to the sidewalk.\nAnd there she paused, seeing him still beside her. Fortunately he had\nhis hat in his hand.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" she asked.\n\n\"To take you home,\" he replied firmly, \"you ought not to go alone.\"\n\nA look of something like terror came into her eyes.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" she protested, with a vehemence that surprised him. \"I am\nstrong. Oh, thank you, sir,--but I can go alone. It's Dicky--my little\nboy. I've never left him so long. I had gone for the medicine and I saw\nthe church. I used to go to church, sir, before we had our troubles--and\nI just went in. It suddenly came over me that God might help me--the\ndoctor can do nothing.\"\n\n\"I will go with you,\" he said.\n\nShe ceased to resist, as one submitting to the fatality of a superior\nwill.\n\nThe pavements that afternoon, as Hodder and the forlorn woman left the\ncool porticoes of St. John's, were like the floor of a stone oven, and\nthe work horses wore little bonnets over their heads. Keeping to the\nshady side, the rector and his companion crossed Tower Street with\nits trolley cars and its awninged stores, and came to that depressing\ndistrict which had reproached him since the first Sunday of his\nministry when he had traversed it with Eldon Parr. They passed the once\nprosperous houses, the corner saloons pandering to two vices, decked\nwith the flamboyant signs of the breweries. The trees were dying along\nthe asphalt and in the yards, the iron fences broken here and there, the\ncopings stained with rust and soot. Hodder's thoughts might have been\nlikened to the heated air that simmered above the bricks.\n\nThey were in Dalton Street! She seemed to have forgotten his presence,\nher pace quickened as she turned into a gate and flew up a flight of\ndirty stone steps, broken and sagging. Hodder took in, subconsciously,\nthat the house was a dingy grey, of three stories and a Mansard roof,\nwith a bay window on the yard side, and a fly-blown sign, \"Rooms to\nRent\" hanging in one window. Across the street, on a lot that had once\nheld a similar dignified residence, was the yellow brick building of\nthe \"Albert Hotel,\" and next door, on the east, a remodelled house of\n\"apartments\" with speaking tubes in the doorway.\n\nThe woman led him up another flight of steps to the open door of\nthe house, through a hallway covered with a ragged carpet, where a\ndilapidated walnut hat-rack stood, up the stairs, threading a dark\npassage that led into a low-ceiled, stifling room at the very back.\nA stout, slatternly person in a wrapper rose as they entered, but the\nmother cast herself down beside the lounge where the child was. Hodder\nhad a moment of fear that she was indeed too late, so still the boy lay,\nso pathetically wan was the little face and wasted the form under the\ncotton nightgown. The mother passed her hand across his forehead.\n\n\"Dicky!\" she whispered fearfully, \"Dicky!\"\n\nHe opened his eyes and smiled at her; feebly.\n\nThe stout woman, who had been looking on with that intensity of\nsympathy of which the poor are capable, began waving gently the\npalm-leaf fan. She was German.\n\n\"He is so good, is Dicky. He smile at me when I fan him--once, twice. He\ncomplains not at all.\"\n\nThe mother took the fan from her, hand.\n\n\"Thank you for staying with him, Mrs. Breitmann. I was gone longer than\nI expected.\" The fact that the child still lived, that she was again in\nhis presence, the absorbing act of caring for him seemed to have calmed\nher.\n\n\"It is nothing, what I do,\" answered Mrs. Breitmann, and turned away\nreluctantly, the tears running on her cheeks. \"When you go again, I come\nalways, Mrs. Garvin. Ach!\"\n\nHer exclamation was caused by the sight of the tall figure and black\ncoat of the rector, and as she left the room, Mrs. Garvin turned. And he\nnoticed in her eyes the same expression of dread they had held when she\nhad protested against his coming.\n\n\"Please don't think that I'm not thankful--\" she faltered.\n\n\"I am not offering you charity,\" he said. \"Can you not take from other\nhuman beings what you have accepted from this woman who has just left?\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, it isn't that!\" she cried, with a look of trust, of appeal\nthat was new, \"I would do anything--I will do anything. But my\nhusband--he is so bitter against the church, against ministers! If he\ncame home and found you here--\"\n\n\"I know--many people feel that way,\" he assented, \"too many. But you\ncannot let a prejudice stand in the way of saving the boy's life, Mrs.\nGarvin.\"\n\n\"It is more than that. If you knew, sir--\"\n\n\"Whatever it is,\" he interrupted, a little sternly, \"it must not\ninterfere. I will talk to your husband.\"\n\nShe was silent, gazing at him now questioningly, yet with the dawning\nhope of one whose strength is all but gone, and who has found at last a\nstronger to lean upon.\n\nThe rector took the fan from her arrested hand and began to ply it.\n\n\"Listen, Mrs. Garvin. If you had come to the church half an hour later,\nI should have been leaving the city for a place far distant.\"\n\n\"You were going away? You stayed on my account?\"\n\n\"I much prefer to stay, if I can be of any use, and I think I can. I am\nsure I can. What is the matter with the child?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir--he just lies there listless and gets thinner and\nthinner and weaker and weaker. Sometimes he feels sick, but not often.\nThe doctor don't seem to know.\"\n\n\"What doctor have you?\"\n\n\"His name is Welling. He's around the corner.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said the rector. \"This is a case for Dr. Jarvis, who is the\nbest child specialist in the city. He is a friend of mine, and I intend\nto send for him at once. And the boy must go to a hospital--\"\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't, sir.\"\n\nHe had a poignant realization of the agony behind the cry. She breathed\nquickly through her parted lips, and from the yearning in her tired\neyes--as she gazed at the poor little form--he averted his glance.\n\n\"Now, Mrs. Garvin, you must be sensible,\" he said. \"This is no place for\na sick child. And it is such a nice little hospital, the one I have\nin mind, and so many children get well and strong there,\" he added,\ncheerfully.\n\n\"He wouldn't hear of it.\" Hodder comprehended that she was referring to\nher husband. She added inconsequently: \"If I let him go, and he never\ncame back! Oh, I couldn't do it--I couldn't.\"\n\nHe saw that it was the part of wisdom not to press her, to give her time\nto become accustomed to the idea. Come back--to what? His eye wandered\nabout the room, that bespoke the last shifts of poverty, for he knew\nthat none but the desperate were driven to these Dalton Street houses,\nonce the dwellings of the well-to-do, and all the more pitiful for the\ncontrast. The heated air reeked with the smell of stale cooking. There\nwas a gas stove at one side, a linoleum-covered table in the centre,\nlittered with bottles, plates, and pitchers, a bed and chairs which had\nknown better days, new obviously bruised and battered by many enforced\nmovings. In one corner was huddled a little group of toys.\n\nHe was suddenly and guiltily aware that the woman had followed his\nglance.\n\n\"We had them in Alder Street,\" she said. \"We might have been there yet,\nif we hadn't been foolish. It's a pretty street, sir--perhaps you know\nit--you take the Fanshawe Avenue cars to Sherman Heights. The air is\nlike the country there, and all the houses are new, and Dicky had a yard\nto play in, and he used to be so healthy and happy in it... We were\nrich then,--not what you'd call rich,\" she added apologetically, \"but we\nowned a little home with six rooms, and my husband had a good place\nas bookkeeper in a grocery house, and every year for ten years we put\nsomething by, and the boy came. We never knew how well off we were,\nuntil it was taken away from us, I guess. And then Richard--he's my\nhusband--put his savings into a company--he thought it was so safe, and\nwe were to get eight per cent--and the company failed, and he fell sick\nand lost his place, and we had to sell the house, and since he got well\nagain he's been going around trying for something else. Oh, he's tried\nso hard,--every day, and all day long. You wouldn't believe it, sir. And\nhe's so proud. He got a job as porter, but he wasn't able to hold it--he\nwasn't strong enough. That was in April. It almost broke my heart to see\nhim getting shabby--he used to look so tidy. And folks don't want you\nwhen you're shabby.\"...\n\nThere sprang to Hodder's mind a sentence in a book he had recently read:\n\"Our slums became filled with sick who need never have been sick; with\nderelicts who need never have been abandoned.\"\n\nSuddenly, out of the suffocating stillness of the afternoon a woman's\nvoice was heard singing a concert-hall air, accompanied by a piano\nplayed with vigour and abandon. And Hodder, following the sound, looked\nout across the grimy yard--to a window in the apartment house opposite.\n\n\"There's that girl again,\" said the mother, lifting her head. \"She does\nsing nice, and play, poor thing! There was a time when I wouldn't have\nwanted to listen. But Dicky liked it so.... It's the very tune he loved.\nHe don't seem to hear it now. He don't even ask for Mr. Bentley any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bentley?\" the rector repeated. The name was somehow familiar to\nhim.\n\nThe piano and the song ceased abruptly, with a bang.\n\n\"He lives up the street here a way--the kindest old gentleman you ever\nsaw. He always has candy in his pockets for the children, and it's a\nsight to see them follow him up and down the sidewalk. He takes them to\nthe Park in the cars on Saturday afternoons. That was all Dicky could\nthink about at first--would he be well enough to go with Mr. Bentley by\nSaturday? And he was forever asking me to tell Mr. Bentley he was sick.\nI saw the old gentleman on the street to-day, and I almost went up to\nhim. But I hadn't the courage.\"\n\nThe child moaned, stirred, and opened his eyes, gazing at them\nfeverishly, yet without seeming comprehension. She bent over him,\ncalling his name.... Hodder thrust the fan into her hand, and rose.\n\n\"I am going to telephone Dr. Jarvis,\" he said, \"and then I shall come\nback, in order to be here when he arrives.\"\n\nShe looked up at him.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, sir,--I guess it's for the best--\"\n\nHer voice died away, and the rector, seeking for the cause, saw that\na man had entered the room. He walked up to the couch and stood for\na moment staring moodily at the child, while the woman watched him,\ntransfixed.\n\n\"Richard!\" she said.\n\nHe paid no attention to her. She turned to Hodder. \"This is my husband,\nsir.... Richard, I went into the church--just for a moment--I--I\ncouldn't help it, and this gentleman--the minister--came home with me.\nHe wanted to--he thought I was sick. And now he's going out to get the\nbest doctor in the city for Dicky.\"\n\nThe man turned suddenly and confronted the rector.\n\n\"Why don't you let him die, you and your church people?\" he asked.\n\"You've done your worst to kill him.\"\n\nThe woman put her hand fearfully, imploringly on the man's arm.\n\n\"Richard!\" she whispered.\n\nBut as Hodder glanced from the derelict beside him a wave of\ncomprehension passed through him that swept him clean of indignation, of\nresentment. And this man had been prosperous and happy!\n\n\"There is but one way to save the boy's life, Mr. Garvin,\" he said, \"and\nthat is to put him in charge of Dr. Jarvis.\"\n\nThe man made no reply, but went over to the window, staring out into the\nyard. There was something vaguely ominous in his attitude. The rector\nwatched him a moment, and then turned to the mother.\n\n\"You must not lose hope,\" he told her.\n\nShe looked at him with terror-stricken eyes that sought to be grateful.\nHe had picked up his hat from a corner of the littered table, and\nstarted to leave, when Garvin, by a sudden movement, planted himself\nin the doorway. Whether he had been drinking, or whether he were merely\ncrazed by misfortune and the hopeless search in the heat for employment,\nand by lack of proper nourishment, Hodder could not say. There was a\nlight in his eyes like that in a wounded animal's; and although he was\nthin and slight, he had the concentrated power of desperation.\n\n\"Say, what church do you come from?\" he demanded.\n\n\"From St. John's,\" said the rector.\n\n\"Eldon Parr's church?\"\n\nHodder started, in spite of himself, at the name.\n\n\"Mr. Parr is a member of the congregation.\"\n\n\"Come off! He owns it and runs it, the same as he does everything else\nin this town. Maybe you don't think I read the Sunday papers. Say, I was\nrespectable once, and had a good place. You wouldn't believe it, would\nyou?\"\n\nHodder hesitated. There was obviously no way to pass the man except by\nusing physical force.\n\n\"If you have anything to say to me, Mr. Garvin, I shall be glad to\ntalk to you later. You must not stop me now,\" he said with a touch of\nseverity.\n\n\"You'll listen to me, right here and now,\" cried Garvin. \"If you think I\nam going to let Eldon Parr's minister, or any one else belonging to him,\nsave that boy's life, you've got another guess comin'. That's all. I'd\nrather have him die--d'ye hear? I'd rather have him die.\"\n\nThe woman behind them whimpered.... The name was ringing like a knell in\nHodder's head--Eldon Parr! Coming, as it had, like a curse from the\nlips of this wretched, half-demented creature, it filled his soul with\ndismay. And the accusation had in it the profound ring of truth. He was\nEldon Parr's minister, and it was Eldon Parr who stood between him and\nhis opportunity.\n\n\"Why do you speak of Mr. Parr?\" he asked, though the question cost him a\nsupreme effort.\n\n\"Why do I speak of him? My God, because he ruined me. If it hadn't been\nfor him, damn him, I'd have a home, and health and happiness to-day, and\nthe boy would be well and strong instead of lying there with the life\nall but gone out of him. Eldon Parr did for me, and now he's murdered my\nson--that's why I mention him.\"\n\nIn the sudden intensity of his feeling, Hodder seized Garvin by the\narms--arms that were little more than skin and bone. The man might be\ncrazed, he might be drunk: that he believed what he was saying there\ncould be no question. He began to struggle violently, but the rector was\nstrong.\n\n\"Be still,\" he commanded. And suddenly, overcome less by the physical\npower than by the aspect of the clergyman, an expression of bewilderment\ncame into his eyes, and he was quiet. Hodder dropped his arms. \"I do not\nintend to go until I hear what you have to say. It would be useless, at\nany rate, since your child's life is at stake. Tell me how Mr. Parr has\nruined you.\"\n\nGarvin stared at him, half in suspicion, half in amazement.\n\n\"I guess you never knew of his ruining anybody, did you?\" he demanded\nsullenly. \"Well, I'll tell you all right, and you can go and tell him.\nHe won't care much--he's used to it by this time, and he gets square\nwith God by his churches and charities. Did you ever hear of a stock\ncalled Consolidated Tractions?\"\n\nConsolidated Tractions! In contrast to the sordid misery and degradation\nof this last refuge of the desperate Hodder saw the lofty, panelled\nsmoking room at Francis Ferguson's, and was listening again to Wallis\nPlimpton's cynical amusement as to how he and Everett Constable and\nEldon Parr himself had \"gat out\" before the crash; \"got out\" with all\nthe money of the wretch who now stood before him! His parishioners! his\nChristians! Oh God!\n\nThe man was speaking in his shrill voice.\n\n\"Well, I was a Traction sucker, all right, and I guess you wouldn't have\nto walk more than two blocks to find another in this neighbourhood. You\nthink Eldon Parr's a big, noble man, don't you? You're proud to run his\nchurch, ain't you? You wouldn't believe there was a time when I thought\nhe was a big man, when I was kind of proud to live in the same city with\nhim. She'll tell you how I used to come home from the store and talk\nabout him after supper, and hope that the kid there would grow up into\na financier like Eldon Parr. The boys at the store talked about him:\nhe sort of laid hold on our imaginations with the library he gave, and\nElmwood Park, and the picture of the big organ in your church in\nthe newspapers--and sometimes, Mary and me and the boy, in the baby\ncarriage, on Sunday afternoons we used to walk around by his house, just\nto look at it. You couldn't have got me to believe that Eldon Parr would\nput his name to anything that wasn't straight.\n\n\"Then Consolidated Tractions came along, with Parr's, name behind it.\nEverybody was talking about it, and how it was payin' eight per cent.\nfrom the start, and extra dividends and all, and what a marvel of\nfinance it was. Before the kid came, as soon as I married her, we began\nto save up for him. We didn't go to the theatres or nothing. Well, I put\nit all, five thousand dollars, into Consolidated. She'll tell you how we\nsat up half the night after we got the first dividend talking about\nhow we'd send the kid to college, and after we went to bed we\ncouldn't sleep. It wasn't more than a year after that we began to hear\nthings--and we couldn't sleep for sure, and the dividends stopped and\nthe stock tumbled. Even then I wouldn't believe it of him, that he'd\ntake poor people's money that way when he had more than he knew what to\ndo with. I made up my mind if I went down to see him and told him about\nit, he'd make it right. I asked the boss for an hour off, and headed for\nthe Parr building--I've been there as much as fifty times since--but he\ndon't bother with small fry. The clerks laugh when they see me comin'...\nI got sick worryin', and when I was strong enough to be around they'd\nfilled my job at the grocery, and it wasn't long before we had to move\nout of our little home in Alder Street. We've been movin' ever since,\"\nhe cried, and tears of weakness were in his eyes, \"until we've come to\nthis, and we'll have to get out of here in another week. God knows where\nwe'll go then.\"\n\nHodder shuddered.\n\n\"Then I found out how he done it--from a lawyer. The lawyer laughed at\nme, too. Say, do you wonder I ain't got much use for your church people?\nParr got a corporation lawyer named Langmaid--he's another one of your\nmillionnaire crooks--to fix it up and get around the law and keep him\nout of jail. And then they had to settle with Tim Beatty for something\nlike three hundred thousand. You know who Beatty is--he owns this\ncity--his saloon's around here on Elm Street. All the crooks had to\nbe squared. Say,\" he demanded aggressively, \"are Parr and Langmaid any\nbetter than Beatty, or any of the hold-up men Beatty covers? There's a\nstreet-walker over there in those flats that's got a million times more\nchance to get to heaven--if there is any--than those financiers, as they\ncall 'emselves--I ain't much on high finance, but I've got some respect\nfor a second story man now--he takes some risks! I'll tell you what they\ndid, they bought up the short car lines that didn't pay and sold 'em\nto themselves for fifty times as much as they were worth; and they got\ncontrolling interests in the big lines and leased 'em to themselves with\ndividends guaranteed as high as eighteen per cent. They capitalized the\nConsolidated for more millions than a little man like me can think of,\nand we handed 'em our money because we thought they were honest. We\nthought the men who listed the stock on the Exchange were honest. And\nwhen the crash came, they'd got away with the swag, like any common\nhousebreakers. There were dummy directors, and a dummy president. Eldon\nParr didn't have a share--sold out everything when she went over two\nhundred, but you bet he kept his stock in the leased lines, which\nguarantee more than they earn. He cleaned up five million, they say....\nMy money--the money that might give that boy fresh air, and good doctors\n....Say, you believe in hell, don't you? You tell Eldon Parr to keep his\ncharity,--he can't send any of it in here. And you'd better go back to\nthat church of his and pray to keep his soul out of hell.\"...\n\nHis voice, which had risen even to a higher pitch, fell silent. And all\nat once, without warning, Garvin sank, or rather tumbled upon the bed,\nsobbing in a way that was terrible to see. The wife stole across the\nroom, sat down beside him, and laid her hand on his shoulder....\n\nIn spite of the intensity of his own anguish, Hodder was conscious of\na curious detachment; and for months afterward particular smells, the\nsight of a gasoline stove, a certain popular tune gave him a sharp\ntwinge of pain. The acid distilling in his soul etched the scene, the\nsounds, the odours forever in his memory: a stale hot wind from the\nalley rattled the shutter-slats, and blew the door to; the child\nstirred; and above the strident, irregular weeping rose main, in\nironical contrast, the piano and the voice across the yard. In that\nglimpse he had into the heart of life's terrible mystery he momentarily\nunderstood many things: he knew that behind the abandon of the woman's\nsong was the same terror which reigned in the room in which he stood....\n\nThere were voices in the passageway without, a woman saying in a German\naccent,--\"It is here, sir.\"\n\nThere was a knock at the door....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. THE LOST PARISHIONER\n\n\nI\n\nHodder opened the door. In the dingy passageway he perceived a tall\nfigure which immediately turned out to be that of an old gentleman.\nIn spite of the heat, he wore a long coat and an old-fashioned, high\ncollar, a black tie, under which was exposed a triangle of immaculate,\npleated linen. In one hand he held a gold-headed stick, a large tall hat\nof which the silk nap was a little rubbed, a string sustaining a parcel,\nthe brown paper wrapping of which was soaked: in the other, a manila bag\ncontaining lemons.\n\nHis head was bent forward a little, the high dome of it was bald,\nbut the white hair clustered thickly behind the temples. The face was\nclean-shaven, the cheeks touched with red, the nose high and dominating,\ndistinctly philanthropic. And the blue eyes rested on the clergyman with\na benevolence unfeigned.\n\n\"Good afternoon, sir,\" the old gentleman said; \"I am told Mrs. Garvin\nlives here.\"\n\nBefore the rector could reply Mrs. Garvin herself stood between them.\n\n\"It's Mr. Bentley!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"I fear I'm intruding, ma'am,\" he said. \"But some of Dicky's little\nfriends have just informed me that he is ill, and I have taken the\nliberty of calling to inquire.\"\n\nMr. Bentley entered the room,--simple words to express that which was in\nsome sort an event. He laid his parcels on the table, his hat and stick\non a chair, and stood looking down in silence at the thin little form on\nthe couch. Presently he turned.\n\n\"I'm afraid he's very ill, ma'am,\" he said gently. \"You have your own\ndoctor, no doubt. But if you will permit me, as a friend, to make a\nsuggestion, we have in the city one of the best child specialists in\nthe United States, who is never weary of curing these little ones,--Dr.\nJarvis, and I shall be happy to ask him to come and see Dicky.\"\n\nMrs. Garvin glanced at Hodder, who came forward.\n\n\"I was just about to telephone for Dr. Jarvis, Mr. Bentley, when you\narrived. I am Mr. Hodder, of St. John's.\"\n\n\"How do you do, sir?\" The kindly eyes, alight with a gentle flame,\nrested upon the rugged figure of the rector. \"I am glad that you, too,\nagree that Dr. Jarvis is advisable, Mr. Hodder.\"\n\nThere was a sound from the bed. Garvin had got to his feet and was\nstaring wildly, with reddened lids.\n\n\"Are you Horace Bentley?\" he demanded.\n\n\"That is my name, sir,\" Mr. Bentley replied. His expression of surprise\nwas only momentary. And in all his life Hodder had never beheld a\ngreater contrast in human beings than between that gracious and courtly\nold man and the haggard, unkempt, unshaved, and starving outcast facing\nhim. Something like a film came over Garvin's eyes.\n\n\"He ruined you, too, twenty years back--Eldon Parr did for you, too.\nOh, I know his record, I've followed his trail--he got all the Grantham\nstock that would have made you a millionnaire!\"\n\n\"Ah,\" replied Mr. Bentley, smiling to humour him, \"that's something I\nhave no wish to be, sir,--a millionaire.\" He met the frightened gaze of\nthe wife. \"Good day, ma'am. If you will allow me, I'll come to-morrow\nmorning to learn what Dr. Jarvis will have had to say. Have courage,\nma'am, have courage. You may have faith in Dr. Jarvis.\"\n\nThe poor woman was incapable of speech. Mr. Bentley picked up his hat\nand stick.\n\n\"I've taken the liberty of bringing Dicky a little ice and a few\nlemons.\" His eyes rested again on the couch by the window. Then he\nturned to Garvin, who stood mutely, staring. \"Good evening, sir,\" he\nsaid. \"We must look for the best.\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nThey went down the stairs of the shabby and battered house, stairs\nby the side of which holes had been knocked through the faded\nwall-paper--scars of frequent movings. The sound and smell of frying\ncame out of the open door of what once had been the parlour, and on the\nfront steps a little girl darted past them with a pitcher of beer. When\nthey reached the sidewalk Mr. Bentley halted.\n\n\"If you were intending to telephone Dr. Jarvis, Mr. Hodder, there is a\npublic station in the drug store just above here. I know that clergymen\nare busy persons, and I am passing it, if you are pressed for time.\"\n\n\"My only concern is to get Jarvis here,\" said the rector. \"If I may go\nwith you--\"\n\nOnce again in the hot sunlight, reaction had set in. Hodder was suddenly\nunstrung, and the kindly old gentleman beside him seemed for the\ninstant the only fixture in a chaotic universe. It was not until later\nreflection that he realized Mr. Bentley might, by an intuitive sympathy,\na depth of understanding, have drained something of his state, since the\nincidents which followed were to be accounted for on no other grounds.\nIn such elemental moments the frail conventions are swept away: Mr.\nBentley, whoever he might be, was no longer a stranger; and it seemed\nwholly natural to be walking with him up the street, to hear him\nsaying,--not with perfunctory politeness but in a tone that was itself\nan invitation,--\"With pleasure, sir, we'll go together. And let us trust\nthat the doctor will be at home.\"\n\nNor did Hodder stop to wonder, then, why Mr. Bentley should have sought\nin his conversation to dissipate something of the hideous blackness of\na tragedy which must have moved him profoundly. How fortunate, he\ndeclared, that they should have arrived before it was too late! For it\nwas plain to be seen that these Garvins were good people who had been\nbroken by adversity.... The boy had struck him particularly--a lovable,\nmerry little fellow whose clothes, Mr. Bentley observed, were always\nneatly mended, betokening a mother with self-respect and character. He\neven spoke of Garvin: adversity, worry, the heat, constant brooding over\na happier past and an uncertain future--was it surprising that the poor\nman's mind had become unhinged? They must make some plan for Garvin,\nsaid Mr. Bentley, get the man and his wife into the country for a while\namongst kindly people. This might no doubt be arranged....\n\n\"Here we are, sir.\"\n\nThe familiar smell of drugs, the sound of the trickling water in the\nsoda fountain roused Hodder to reality, to action, and he hurried into\nthe telephone booth, fumbled in the dog-eared book, got Dr. Jarvis's\nnumber and called it. An eternity seemed to elapse before he had a\nreply, heard his coin jangling in the bog, recognized the voice of the\ngreat doctor's secretary. Yes, the doctor was in would he speak to Mr.\nHodder, of St. John's?... An interval, during which Hodder was suddenly\nstruck with this designation of himself. Was he still of St. John's,\nthen? An aeon might have elapsed since he had walked down the white\nmarble of its aisle toward the crouching figure in the pew. He was not\nthat man, but another--and still Mr. Hodder, of St. John's.... Then he\nheard the specialist say, \"Hello, Mr. Hodder, what can I do for you?\"\nHeard his own voice in reply, explaining the case. Could the doctor\nfind time? The doctor could: he was never too busy to attend to the\npoor,--though he did not say so: he would be there--by half-past six.\nThe rector hung up the receiver, opened the door of the booth and mopped\nhis brow, for the heat was stifling.\n\n\"The doctor will go,\" he explained in answer to Mr. Bentley's inquiring\nlook.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said the old gentleman, when they were out of the store,\n\"we have done all that we can for the time being. I do not live far from\nhere. Perhaps you would give me the pleasure of taking supper with me,\nif you have no other engagement.\"\n\nNo other engagement! Not until then did Hodder remember his empty rooms\nin the parish house, and the train which was to have borne him away from\nall this already speeding northward. He accepted gratefully, nor did\nhe pause to speculate upon the mystery by which the stream of his life\nseemed so suddenly to have been diverted. He had, indeed, no sense of\nmystery in the presence of this splendidly sane, serene old man, any\nmore than the children who ran after him from the dingy yards and\npassages, calling his name, clinging to the skirts of his coat. These\naccepted him simply as an anomalous fact in their universe, grinned at\nhis pleasantries, and held up grimy little hands for the kidney-shaped\ncandy beans he drew forth from his capacious pockets. In the intervals\nhe reminisced to the rector about the neighbourhood.\n\n\"It seems but a short while ago when the trees met overhead--magnificent\ntrees they were. The asphalt and the soot killed them. And there were\nfruit trees in that yard\"--he pointed with his stick to a littered sun\nparched plot adjoining a battered mansion--\"all pink and white with\nblossoms in the spring. Mr. Hadley lived there--one of our forgotten\ncitizens. He is dead and gone now and his family scattered. That other\nhouse, where the boy lies, belonged to Mr. Villars, a relation of the\nAtterbury family, and I can recall very well a little girl with a pink\nsash and a white dress who used to come running out to meet me with\nflowers in her hands. Incredible as it may seem, she picked them in that\nyard. I thought of her as I went in, how fresh and happy she used to\nbe, and what a different place this was for children then. She must have\nsome of her own by this time.\"\n\nThe character of the street had changed to what might be called\nshabby-genteel, and they stopped before a three-story brick house--one\nof a row--that showed signs of scrupulous care. The steps were newly\nscrubbed, the woodwork neatly painted.\n\n\"This is where I live, sir,\" said Mr. Bentley, opening the door with a\nlatchkey and leading the way into a high room on the right, darkened and\ncool, and filled with superb, old-fashioned rosewood furniture. It\nwas fitted up as a library, with tall shelves reaching almost to the\nceiling.\n\nAn old negro appeared, dressed in a swallow-tailed coat. His hair was as\nwhite as his master's, and his face creased with age.\n\n\"Sam,\" said Mr. Bentley, \"I have brought home a gentleman for supper.\"\n\n\"Yassah, Misteh Ho'ace. I was jest agwine to open up de blin's.\"\n\nHe lifted the wire screens and flung back the shutters, beamed on\nthe rector as he relieved him of his hat, and noiselessly retired.\nCuriosity, hitherto suppressed by more powerful feelings, awoke in\nHodder speculations which ordinarily would have been aroused before:\nevery object in the room bespoke gentility, was eloquent of a day\nwhen wealth was honoured and respected: photographs, daguerreotypes in\nold-fashioned frames bore evidence of friendships of the past, and over\nthe marble mantel hung a portrait of a sweet-faced woman in the costume\nof the thirties, whose eyes reminded Hodder of Mr. Bentley's. Who was\nshe?\n\nHodder wondered. Presently he found himself before a photograph on the\nwall beyond, at which he had been staring unconsciously.\n\n\"Ah, you recognize it,\" said Mr. Bentley.\n\n\"St. John's!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Bentley repeated, \"St. John's.\" He smiled at Hodder's glance\nof bewilderment, and put his hand on the younger man's arm. \"That\npicture was taken before you were born, sir, I venture to say--in 1869.\nI am very fond of it, for it gives the church in perspective, as you\nsee. That was Mr. Gore's house\"--he indicated a square, heavily corniced\nmansion--\"where the hotel now stands, and that was his garden, next the\nchurch, where you see the trees above the wall.\"\n\nThe rector turned again and looked at his host, who, was gazing at the\npicture thoughtfully.\n\n\"I ought to have remembered,\" he said. \"I have seen your name in the\nchurch records, sir, and I have heard Mr. Waring speak of you.\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. Hodder, there is no reason why you should have known me. A\ngreat many years have passed since I was a parishioner of St. John's--a\ngreat many years.\"\n\n\"But it was you,\" the rector began, uncertainly, and suddenly spoke with\nconviction, \"it was you who chose the architect, who did more than other\nmen to make the church what it is.\"\n\n\"Whatever I may have done,\" replied Mr. Bentley, with simple dignity,\n\"has brought its reward. To this day I have not ceased to derive\npleasure from it, and often I go out of my way, through Burton Street,\nalthough the view is cramped. And sometimes,\" he added, with the hint of\na twinkle in his eye, \"I go in. This afternoon is not the first time I\nhave seen you, Mr. Hodder.\"\n\n\"But--?\" said the rector. He stared at the other's face, and the\nquestion died on his lips.\n\n\"You wonder why I am no longer a parishioner. The time came when I\ncould not afford to be.\" There was no hint of reproach in his voice,\nof bitterness. He spoke regretfully, indeed, but as one stating an\nincontrovertible fact. \"I lost my fortune, I could not keep my pew, so\nI deeded it back to the church. My old friends, Mrs. Dimock and Asa\nWaring, and others, too, were very kind. But I could not accept their\nhospitality.\"\n\nHodder bowed his head in silence. What thundered indictment of the\nChurch of Christ could have been as severe, as wholly condemning as\nthese few words so dispassionately uttered by the man beside him?\n\nThe old darky entered, and announced supper.\n\nHodder had lost his way, yet a hand had been held out to him, and he\nseized it. With a sense of being led, psychically as well as physically,\nhe followed Mr. Bentley into a large bedroom, where a high, four-posted\nbed lifted a pleated canopy toward the ceiling. And after he had washed\nhis hands they entered a dining-room looking out upon a little yard\nin the rear, which had been transformed into a garden. Roses, morning\nglories, and nasturtiums were growing against the walls; a hose lay\ncoiled upon the path; the bricks, baked during the day, were splashed\nwith water; the leaves and petals were wet, and the acrid odour of moist\nearth, mingling with perfumes, penetrated the room. Hodder paused in the\nwindow.\n\n\"Sam keeps our flowers alive,\" he heard Mr. Bentley say, \"I don't know\nhow.\"\n\n\"I scrubs 'em, sah,\" said Sam. \"Yassah, I washes 'em like chilluns.\"\n\nHe found himself, at Mr. Bentley's request, asking grace, the old darky\nwith reverently bent head standing behind his master; sitting down at\na mahogany table that reflected like a mirror the few pieces of old\nsilver, to a supper of beaten biscuits that burned one's fingers, of\n'broiled chicken and coffee, and sliced peaches and cream. Mr. Bentley\nwas talking of other days--not so long gone by when the great city had\nbeen a village, or scarcely more. The furniture, it seemed, had come\nfrom his own house in what was called the Wilderness Road, not far from\nthe river banks, over the site of which limited trains now rolled on\ntheir way eastward toward the northernmost of the city's bridges. He\nmentioned many names, some remembered, some forgotten, like his own;\ndwelt on pleasures and customs gone by forever.\n\n\"A little while after I moved in here, I found that one old man could\nnot fill the whole of this house, so I let the upper floors,\" he\nexplained, smilingly. \"Some day I must introduce you to my tenants, Mr.\nHodder.\"\n\nBy degrees, as Hodder listened, he became calm. Like a child, he found\nhimself distracted, talking, asking questions: and the intervals grew\nlonger between the recurrent surges of fear when the memory rose before\nhim of the events of the day,--of the woman, the child, and the man:\nof Eldon Parr and this deed he had done; hinting, as it did, of closed\nchambers of other deeds yet to be opened, of countless, hidden miseries\nstill to be revealed: when he heard once more the tortured voice of\nthe banker, and the question: \"How would you like to live in this\nhouse--alone?\" In contrast, now he beheld the peace in the face of the\nman whose worldly goods Eldon Parr had taken, and whom he had driven out\nof the church. Surely, this man had found a solution!... What was it?\n\nHodder thought of the child, of the verdict of Dr. Jarvis, but he\nlingered on, loth to leave,--if the truth be told--afraid to leave;\ndrawing strength from his host's calm, wondering as to the source of it,\nas to the life which was its expression; longing, yet not presuming, to\nquestion. The twilight deepened, and the old darky lit a lamp and led\nthe way back to the library.\n\n\"Sam,\" said Mr. Bentley, \"draw up the armchair for Mr. Hodder beside the\nwindow. It is cooler there.\"\n\n\"I ought to go,\" Hodder said. \"I ought to see how the child is. Jarvis\nwill have been there by this time, and there may be necessaries--\"\n\n\"Jarvis will have attended to that,\" Mr. Bentley replied. \"Sit down,\nMr. Hodder. I am not sure that, for the present, we have not done all in\nthis case that is humanly possible.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said the rector, \"that they will accept nothing from me.\" It\ncame from him, spontaneously, like a cry. He had not meant to say it. \"I\ndon't blame them. I don't blame them for losing their faith in God and\nman, in the Church. I ought to have seen it before, but I was blind,\nincredibly blind--until it struck me in the face. You saw it, sir, and\nyou left a church from which the poor are thrust out, which refuses to\nheed the first precept of its Master.\"\n\n\"I saw it,\" answered Mr. Bentley, \"but I could do nothing. Perhaps you\ncan do--something.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Hodder exclaimed sharply, \"why do you say that? The Church is\nparalyzed, chained. How can she reach these wretched people who are the\nvictims of the ruthless individualism and greed of those who control\nher? You know--that man, Mr. Bentley.\" (Hodder could not bring himself\nto pronounce Eldon Parr's name.) \"I had an affection for him, I pitied\nhim, because he suffers--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" echoed Mr. Bentley, \"he suffers.\"\n\nHodder was momentarily arrested by the sadness of his tone.\n\n\"But he doesn't know why he suffers--he cannot be made to see,\" the\nrector went on. \"And he is making others suffer,--hideously, while\nhe imagines himself a Christian. He is the Church to that miserable,\nhopeless wretch we saw to-day, and to hundreds of the same kind whom\nhe has driven to desperation. And I--who am supposed to be the vicar of\nGod--I am powerless. They have a contempt for me, a just contempt. They\nthrust me out of their doors, bid me to return and minister to their\noppressors. You were right to leave, and I should have left long since.\"\n\nHe had not spoken with violence, or with a lack of control. He seemed\nrather to have regained a mastery of himself, and felt as a man from\nwhom the shackles have been struck, proclaiming his freedom. Mr.\nBentley's eyes lighted in involuntary response as he gazed at the figure\nand face before him. He pressed his hands together.\n\n\"If you will forgive a curiosity, Mr. Hodder, that is somewhat due to my\ninterest in a church with which I have many precious associations, may I\nask if this is a sudden determination on your part?\"\n\n\"No,\" Hodder said. \"I have known ever since I came here that something\nwas wrong, but at first I couldn't see it, and after that I wouldn't see\nit. That is about what happened, as I look back on it.\n\n\"But the farther in I went,\" Hodder continued, \"the more tangled\nand bewildered I became. I was hypnotized, I think,\" he added with\na gesture,--\"hypnotized, as a man is who never takes his eyes from a\npattern. I wanted to get at this neighbourhood--Dalton Street--I mean,\nand finally I agreed to the establishment of a settlement house over\nhere, to be paid for largely by Eldon Parr and Francis Ferguson. I\ncouldn't see the folly of such an undertaking--the supreme irony of it,\nuntil--until it was pointed out to me.\" He hesitated; the remembrance of\nAlison Parr ran through him, a thread of pain. \"And even then I tried to\ndodge the issue, I tried to make myself believe that good might flow out\nof evil; that the Church, which is supposed to be founded on the highest\nideal ever presented to man, might compromise and be practical, that\nshe might accept money which had been wrung from a trusting public\nby extortion, by thinly disguised thievery such as this Consolidated\nTractions Company fraud, and do good with it! And at last I made up my\nmind to go away, to-day, to a quiet place where I might be alone, and\nreflect, when by a singular circumstance I was brought into contact\nwith this man, Garvin. I see now, clearly enough, that if I had gone, I\nshould never have come back.\"\n\n\"And you still intend to go?\" Mr. Bentley asked.\n\nHodder leaned his elbow against the mantel. The lamplight had a curious\neffect on Mr. Bentley's face.\n\n\"What can I do?\" he demanded. The question was not aimed directly at his\nhost--it was in the nature of a renewed appeal to a tribunal which\nhad been mute, but with which he now seemed vaguely aware of a\ncertain contact. \"Even supposing I could bring myself to accept the\ncompromise--now that I see it clearly, that the end justifies the\nmeans--what good could I accomplish? You saw what happened this\nafternoon--the man would have driven me out if, it hadn't been for you.\nThis whole conception of charity is a crime against civilization--I\nhad to have that pointed out to me, too,--this system of legalized or\nsemi-legalized robbery and the distribution of largesse to the victims.\nThe Church is doing wrong, is stultifying herself in encouraging it. She\nshould set her face rigidly against it, stand for morality and justice\nand Christianity in government, not for pauperizing. It is her mission\nto enlighten these people, all people--to make them self-respecting,\nto give them some notion of the dignity of their souls and their rights\nbefore God and man.\"\n\n\"Aren't you yourself suggesting,\" said Mr. Bentley, \"the course which\nwill permit you to remain?\"\n\nHodder was silent. The thought struck him with tremendous force. Had he\nsuggested it? And how--why? Could it be done? Could he do it or begin\nit?\n\n\"We have met at last in a singular way,\" he heard Mr. Bentley going on,\n\"in a way that has brushed aside the conventions, in a way--I am happy\nto say--that has enabled you to give me your confidence. And I am an old\nman,--that has made it easier. I saw this afternoon, Mr. Hodder, that\nyou were troubled, although you tried to hide it.\"\n\n\"I knew that you saw it,\" Hodder said.\n\n\"Nor was it difficult for me to guess something of the cause of it. The\nsame thing has troubled me.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Bentley answered. \"I left St. John's, but the habits and\naffections of a lifetime are not easily severed. And some time before\nI left it I began to have visions of a future for it. There was a\nquestion, many years ago, as to whether a new St. John's should not be\nbuilt in the West End, on a site convenient to the parishioners, and\nthis removal I opposed. Mr. Waring stood by me. We foresaw the day when\nthis district would be--what it is now--the precarious refuge of the\nunfortunate in the battle of life, of just such unhappy families as the\nGarvins, of miserable women who sell themselves to keep alive. I thought\nof St. John's, as you did, as an oasis in a desert of misery and vice.\nAt that time I, too, believed in the system of charities which you have\nso well characterized as pauperizing.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\nMr. Bentley smiled, as at a reminiscence.\n\n\"My eyes were opened,\" he replied, and in these simple words summed up\nand condemned it all. \"They are craving bread, and we fling them atones.\nI came here. It was a house I owned, which I saved from the wrecks, and\nas I look back upon what the world would call a misfortune, sir, I can\nsee that it was a propitious event, for me. The street 'ran down,'\nas the saying goes. I grew gradually to know these people, my new\nneighbours, largely through their children, and I perceived many things\nI had not dreamed of--before then. I saw how the Church was hampered,\nfettered; I saw why they disliked and distrusted it.\"\n\n\"And yet you still believed that it had a mission?\" Hodder interrupted.\nHe had been listening with rapt attention.\n\n\"I still believed it,\" said Mr. Bentley. \"My conception of that mission\nchanged, grew, and yet it seemed further and further from fulfilment.\nAnd then you came to St. John's.\"\n\n\"I!\" The cry was involuntary.\n\n\"You,\" Mr. Bentley repeated. \"Sometimes,\" he added whimsically, \"I go\nthere, as I have told you. I saw you, I heard you preach. I talked to\nmy friend Waring about you. I saw that your eyes were not opened, but\nI think I had a certain presentiment, for which I do not pretend to\naccount, that they would be opened.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said the rector, \"that if I believe in the mission of the\nChurch as I have partially stated it here tonight, I--should stay and\nfight for it.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Mr. Bentley replied.\n\nThere was a note of enthusiasm, almost of militancy in the old\ngentleman's tone that surprised and agitated Hodder. He took a turn up\nand down the room before he answered.\n\n\"I ought to tell you that the view I expressed a moment ago is new to\nme. I had not thought of it before, and it is absolutely at variance\nwith any previous ideas I have held. I can see that it must involve,\nif carried to its logical conclusion, a change in the conception of\nChristianity I have hitherto held.\"\n\nHe was too intent upon following up the thought to notice Mr. Bentley's\nexpression of assent.\n\n\"And suppose,\" he asked, \"I were unable to come to any conclusion? I\nwill be frank, Mr. Bentley, and confess to you that at present I cannot\nsee my way. You have heard me preach--you know what my beliefs have\nbeen. They are shattered. And, while I feel that there is some definite\nconnection between the view of the Church which I mentioned and her\nmessage to the individual, I do not perceive it clearly. I am not\nprepared at present to be the advocate of Christianity, because I do not\nknow what Christianity is. I thought I knew.\n\n\"I shall have to begin all over again, as though I had never taken\norders, submit to a thorough test, examine the evidence impartially. It\nis the only way. Of this much I am sure, that the Church as a whole\nhas been engaged in a senseless conflict with science and progressive\nthought, that she has insisted upon the acceptance of facts which are in\nviolation of reason and which have nothing to do with religion. She has\ntaught them to me--made them, in fact, a part of me. I have clung to\nthem as long as I can, and in throwing them over I don't know where I\nshall land.\"\n\nHis voice was measured, his words chosen, yet they expressed a withering\nindignation and contempt which were plainly the culmination of months of\nbewilderment--now replaced by a clear-cut determination.\n\n\"I do not blame any individual,\" he continued, \"but the system by which\nclergymen are educated.\n\n\"I intend to stay here, now, without conducting any services, and find\nout for myself what the conditions are here in Dalton Street. You know\nthose people, Mr. Bentley, you understand them, and I am going to ask\nyou to help me. You have evidently solved the problem.\"\n\nMr. Bentley rose. And he laid a hand, which was not quite steady, on the\nrector's shoulder.\n\n\"Believe me, sir,\" he replied, \"I appreciate something of what such a\ncourse must mean to you--a clergyman.\" He paused, and a look came upon\nhis face, a look that might scarce have been called a smile--Hodder\nremembered it as a glow--reminiscent of many things. In it a life was\nsummed ups in it understanding, beneficence, charity, sympathy, were\nall expressed, yet seemingly blended into one. \"I do not know what\nmy testimony may be worth to you, my friend, but I give it freely. I\nsometimes think I have been peculiarly fortunate. But I have lived a\ngreat many years, and the older I get and the more I see of human\nnature the firmer has grown my conviction of its essential nobility and\ngoodness.\"\n\nHodder marvelled, and was silent.\n\n\"You will come here, often,--every day if you can. There are many men\nand women, friends of mine, whom I should like you to know, who would\nlike to know you.\"\n\n\"I will, and thank you,\" Hodder answered. Words were inadequate for the\noccasion....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE WOMAN OF THE SONG\n\nOn leaving Mr. Bentley, Hodder went slowly down Dalton Street, wondering\nthat mere contact with another human being should have given him the\nresolution to turn his face once again toward the house whither he was\nbound. And this man had given him something more. It might hardly have\nbeen called faith; a new courage to fare forth across the Unknown--that\nwas it; hope, faint but revived.\n\nPresently he stopped on the sidewalk, looked around him, and read a sign\nin glaring, electric letters, Hotel Albert. Despite the heat, the place\nwas ablaze with lights. Men and women were passing, pausing--going in. A\nmotor, with a liveried chauffeur whom he remembered having seen before,\nwas standing in front of the Rathskeller. The nightly carousal was\nbeginning.\n\nHodder retraced his steps, crossed the street diagonally, came to the\ndilapidated gate he remembered so well, and looked up through the dusk\nat the house. If death had entered it, there was no sign: death must be\na frequent visitor hereabouts. On the doorsteps he saw figures outlined,\nslatternly women and men in shirt-sleeves who rose in silence to make\nway for him, staring at him curiously. He plunged into the hot darkness\nof the hall, groped his way up the stairs and through the passage, and\nhesitated. A single gas jet burned low in the stagnant air, and after\na moment he made out, by its dim light, a woman on her knees beside the\ncouch, mechanically moving the tattered palm-leaf over the motionless\nlittle figure. The child was still alive. He drew a deep breath, and\nentered; at the sound of his step Mrs. Garvin suddenly started up.\n\n\"Richard!\" she cried, and then stood staring at the rector. \"Have you\nseen my husband, sir? He went away soon after you left.\"\n\nHodder, taken by surprise, replied that he had not. Her tone, her\ngesture of anxiety he found vaguely disquieting.\n\n\"The doctor has been here?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered absently. \"I don't know where he can be--Richard. He\ndidn't even wait to see the doctor. And he thinks so much of Dicky, sir,\nhe sits here of an evening--\"\n\nHodder sat down beside her, and taking the palm-leaf from her hand,\nbegan himself to fan the child. Something of her misgiving had\ncommunicated itself to him.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" he said. \"Remember that you have been through a great\ndeal, and it is natural that you should be overwrought. Your husband\nfeels strongly. I don't blame him. And the sight of me this afternoon\nupset him. He has gone out to walk.\"\n\n\"Richard is proud,\" she answered simply. \"He used to say he'd rather\ndie than take charity--and now he's come to it. And it's--that man, sir,\nwho's got on his brain, and changed him. He wasn't always like this, but\nnow he can't seem to think of anything else. He wakes up in the night\n.... And he used to have such a sweet nature--you wouldn't have known\nhim... and came home so happy in the evenings in Alder Street, often\nwith a little fruit, or something he'd bought for us, and romp with\nDicky in the yard, and I'd stand and laugh at them. Even after we'd lost\nour money, when he was sick that time, he didn't feel this way. It grew\non him when he couldn't get work, and then he began to cut things out of\nthe papers about Mr. Parr. And I have sometimes thought that that's kept\nhim from getting work. He talks about it, and people don't know what\nto make of him. They don't know how hard he'd try if they'd give him\nsomething.\"....\n\n\"We shall find something,\" said the rector, striving to throw into his\nvoice confidence and calm. He did not dare to look at her, but continued\nto move the fan.\n\nThe child stirred a little. Mrs. Garvin put out her hand.\n\n\"Yes, the doctor was here. He was very kind. Oh, sir,\" she exclaimed,\n\"I hope you won't think us ungrateful--and that Mr. Bentley won't. Dr.\nJarvis has hopes, sir,--he says--I forget the name he called it, what\nDicky has. It's something uncommon. He says it was--brought on by\nthe heat, and want of food--good food. And he's coming himself in\nthe morning to take him out to that hospital beyond the park--in an\nautomobile, sir. I was just thinking what a pity it is Dicky wouldn't\nrealize it. He's always wanted to ride in one.\" Suddenly her tears\nflowed, unheeded, and she clung to the little hand convulsively. \"I\ndon't know what I shall do without him, Sir, I don't.... I've always had\nhim... and when he's sick, among strangers.\"...\n\nThe rector rose to the occasion.\n\n\"Now, Mrs. Garvin,\" he said firmly, \"you must remember that there is\nonly one way to save the boy's life. It will be easy to get you a room\nnear the hospital, where you can see him constantly.\"\n\n\"I know--I know, sir. But I couldn't leave his father, I couldn't leave\nRichard.\" She looked around distractedly. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He will come back presently,\" said the rector. \"If not, I will look for\nhim.\"\n\nShe did not reply, but continued to weep in silence. Suddenly, above the\nconfused noises of the night, the loud notes of a piano broke, and the\nwoman whose voice he had heard in the afternoon began once more with\nappalling vigour to sing. The child moaned.\n\nMrs. Garvin started up hysterically.\n\n\"I can't stand it--I can't stand her singing that now,\" she sobbed.\n\nThirty feet away, across the yard, Hodder saw the gleaming window from\nwhich the music came. He got to his feet. Another verse began, with more\nof the brazen emphasis of the concert-hall singer than ever. He glanced\nat the woman beside him, irresolutely.\n\n\"I'll speak to her,\" he said.\n\nMrs. Garvin did not appear to hear him, but flung herself down beside\nthe lounge. As he seized his hat and left the room he had the idea of\ntelephoning for a nurse, when he almost ran into some one in the upper\nhall, and recognized the stout German woman, Mrs. Breitmann.\n\n\"Mrs. Garvin\"--he said, \"she ought not to be left--\"\n\n\"I am just now going,\" said Mrs. Breitmann. \"I stay with her until her\nhusband come.\"\n\nSuch was the confidence with which, for some reason, she inspired him,\nthat he left with an easier mind.\n\nIt was not until the rector had arrived at the vestibule of the\napartment house next door that something--of the difficulty and delicacy\nof the errand he had undertaken came home to him. Impulse had brought\nhim thus far, but now he stood staring helplessly at a row of bells,\nspeaking tubes, and cards. Which, for example, belonged to the lady\nwhose soprano voice pervaded the neighbourhood? He looked up and down\nthe street, in the vain hope of finding a messenger. The song continued:\nhe had promised to stop it. Hodder accused himself of cowardice.\n\nTo his horror, Hodder felt stealing over him, incredible though it\nseemed after the depths through which he had passed, a faint sense\nof fascination in the adventure. It was this that appalled him--this\ntenacity of the flesh,--which no terrors seemed adequate to drive out.\nThe sensation, faint as it was, unmanned him. There were still many\nunexplored corners in his soul.\n\nHe turned, once more contemplated the bells, and it was not until\nthen he noticed that the door was ajar. He pushed it open, climbed the\nstaircase, and stood in the doorway of what might be called a sitting\nroom, his eyes fixed on a swaying back before an upright piano against\nthe wall; his heart seemed to throb with the boisterous beat of the\nmusic. The woman's hair, in two long and heavy plaits falling below her\nwaist, suddenly fascinated him. It was of the rarest of russet reds. She\ncame abruptly to the end of the song.\n\n\"I beg your pardon--\" he began.\n\nShe swung about with a start, her music dropping to the floor, and\nstared at him. Her tattered blue kimono fell away at her elbows, her\nfull throat was bare, and a slipper she had kicked off lay on the floor\nbeside her. He recoiled a little, breathing deeply. She stared at him.\n\n\"My God, how you scared me!\" she exclaimed. Evidently a second glance\nbrought to her a realization of his clerical costume. \"Say, how did you\nget in here?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said again, \"but there is a very sick child in\nthe house next door and I came to ask you if you would mind not playing\nany more to-night.\"\n\nShe did not reply at once, and her expression he found unsolvable. Much\nof it might be traced to a life which had contracted the habit of taking\nnothing on trust, a life which betrayed itself in unmistakable traces\nabout the eyes. And Hodder perceived that the face, if the stamp of\nthis expression could have been removed, was not unpleasing, although\nindulgence and recklessness were beginning to remould it.\n\n\"Quit stringin' me,\" she said.\n\nFor a moment he was at a loss. He gathered that she did not believe him,\nand crossed to the open window.\n\n\"If you will come here,\" he said, \"I will show you the room where he\nlies. We hope to be able to take him to the hospital to-morrow.\" He\npaused a moment, and added: \"He enjoyed your music very much when he was\nbetter.\"\n\nThe comment proved a touchstone.\n\n\"Say,\" she remarked, with a smile that revealed a set of surprisingly\ngood teeth, \"I can make the box talk when I get a-goin'. There's no\nstopping me this side of grand opera,--that's no fable. I'm not so bad\nfor an enginoo, am I?\"\n\nThus directly appealed to, in common courtesy he assented.\n\n\"No indeed,\" he said.\n\n\"That's right,\" she declared. \"But the managers won't have it at any\nprice. Those jays don't know anything, do they? They've only got a dream\nof what the public wants. You wouldn't believe it, but I've sung for\n'em, and they threw me out. You wouldn't believe it, would you?\"\n\n\"I must own,\" said the rector, \"that I have never had any experience\nwith managers.\"\n\nShe sat still considering him from the piano stool, her knees apart, her\nhands folded in her lap. Mockery came into her eyes.\n\n\"Say, what did you come in here for, honest injun?\" she demanded.\n\nHe was aware of trying to speak sternly, and of failing. To save his\nlife he could not, then, bring up before himself the scene in the little\nback room across the yard in its full terror and reality, reproduce his\nown feelings of only a few minutes ago which had impelled him hither. A\nmonth, a year might have elapsed. Every faculty was now centred on the\nwoman in front of him, and on her life.\n\n\"Why do you doubt me?\" he asked.\n\nShe continued to contemplate him. Her eyes were strange, baffling,\nsmouldering, yellow-brown, shifting, yet not shifty: eyes with a\nhistory. Her laugh proclaimed both effrontery and uneasiness.\n\n\"Don't get huffy,\" she said. \"The kid's sick--that's on the level, is\nit? You didn't come 'round to see me?\" The insinuation was in her voice\nas well as in her words. He did not resent it, but felt an odd thrill of\ncommingled pity and--fear.\n\n\"I came for the reason I have given you,\" he replied; and added, more\ngently: \"I know it is a good deal to ask, but you will be doing a great\nkindness. The mother is distracted. The child, as I told you, will be\ntaken to the hospital in the morning.\"\n\nShe reached out a hand and closed the piano softly.\n\n\"I guess I can hold off for to-night,\" she said. \"Sometimes things get\nkind of dull--you know, when there's nothing doing, and this keeps me\nlively. How old is the kid?\"\n\n\"About nine,\" he estimated.\n\n\"Say, I'm sorry.\" She spoke with a genuineness of feeling that surprised\nhim. He went slowly, almost apologetically toward the door.\n\n\"Good night,\" he said, \"and thank you.\"\n\nHer look halted him.\n\n\"What's your hurry?\" she demanded.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said hastily, \"but I must be going.\" He was, in truth,\nin a panic to leave.\n\n\"You're a minister, ain't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"I guess you don't think much of me, do you?\" she demanded.\n\nHe halted abruptly, struck by the challenge, and he saw that this woman\nhad spoken not for herself, but for an entire outlawed and desperate\nclass. The fact that the words were mocking and brazen made no\ndifference; it would have been odd had they not been so. With a shock of\nsurprise he suddenly remembered that his inability to reach this\nclass had been one of the causes of his despair! And now? With the\nrealization, reaction set in, an overpowering feeling of weariness, a\ndesire--for rest--for sleep. The electric light beside the piano danced\nbefore his eyes, yet he heard within him a voice crying out to him to\nstay. Desperately tired though he was, he must not leave now. He walked\nslowly to the table, put his hat on it and sat down in a chair beside\nit.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, cut it out!\" said the woman. \"I'm on to you church folks.\" She\nlaughed. \"One of 'em came in here once, and wanted to pray. I made a\nmonkey of him.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said the rector, smiling a little, \"that is not the reason why\nyou wish me to stay.\"\n\nShe regarded him doubtfully.\n\n\"You're not the same sort,\" she announced at length.\n\n\"What sort was he?\"\n\n\"He was easy,--old enough to know better--most of the easy ones are. He\nmarched in sanctimonious as you please, with his mouth full of salvation\nand Bible verses.\" She laughed again at the recollection.\n\n\"And after that,\" said the rector, \"you felt that ministers were a lot\nof hypocrites.\"\n\n\"I never had much opinion of 'em,\" she admitted, \"nor of church people,\neither,\" she added, with emphasis.\n\n\"There's Ferguson, who has the department store,--he's 'way up' in\nchurch circles. I saw him a couple of months ago, one Sunday morning,\ndriving to that church on Burton Street, where all the rich folks go. I\nforget the name--\"\n\n\"St. John's,\" he supplied. He had got beyond surprise.\n\n\"St. John's--that's it. They tell me he gives a lot of money to\nit--money that he steals from the girls he hires. Oh, yes, he'll get to\nheaven--I don't think.\"\n\n\"How do you mean that he steals money from the girls?\"\n\n\"Say, you are innocent--ain't you! Did you ever go down to that store?\nDo you know what a floorwalker is? Did you ever see the cheap guys\nhanging around, and the young swells waiting to get a chance at the\ngirls behind the counters? Why do you suppose so many of 'em take to the\neasy life? I'll put you next--because Ferguson don't pay 'em enough to\nlive on. That's why. He makes 'em sign a paper, when he hires 'em, that\nthey live at home, that they've got some place to eat and sleep, and\nthey sign it all right. That's to square up Ferguson's conscience. But\nsay, if you think a girl can support herself in this city and dress on\nwhat he pays, you've got another guess comin'.\"\n\nThere rose up before him, unsummoned, the image of Nan Ferguson, in all\nher freshness and innocence, as she had stood beside him on the porch\nin Park Street. He was somewhat astonished to find himself defending his\nparishioner.\n\n\"May it not be true, in order to compete with other department stores,\nthat Mr. Ferguson has to pay the same wages?\" he said.\n\n\"Forget it. I guess you know what Galt House is? That's where women like\nme can go when we get all played out and there's nothing left in the\ngame--it's on River Street. Maybe you've been there.\"\n\nHodder nodded.\n\n\"Well,\" she continued, \"Ferguson pays a lot of money to keep that going,\nand gets his name in the papers. He hands over to the hospitals where\nsome of us die--and it's all advertised. He forks out to the church.\nNow, I put it to you, why don't he sink some of that money where it\nbelongs--in living wages? Because there's nothing in it for him--that's\nwhy.\"\n\nThe rector looked at her in silence. He had not suspected her of so much\nintellect. He glanced about the apartment, at the cheap portiere flung\nover the sofa; at the gaudy sofa cushions, two of which bore the names\nand colours of certain colleges. The gas log was almost hidden by dried\npalm leaves, a cigarette stump lay on the fender; on the mantel above\nwere several photographs of men and at the other side an open door\nrevealed a bedroom.\n\n\"This is a nice place, ain't it?\" she observed. \"I furnished it when I\nwas on velvet--nothing was too good for me. Money's like champagne when\nyou take the cork out, it won't keep. I was rich once. It was lively\nwhile it lasted,\" she added, with a sigh: \"I've struck the down trail.\nI oughtn't, by rights, to be here fooling with you. There's nothing in\nit.\" She glanced at the clock. \"I ought to get busy.\"\n\nAs the realization of her meaning came to him, he quivered.\n\n\"Is there no way but that?\" he asked, in a low voice.\n\n\"Say, you're not a-goin' to preach, are you?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered, \"God forbid! I was not asking the question of you.\"\n\nShe stared at him.\n\n\"Of who, then?\"\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\"You've left me at the station. But on the level, you don't seem to know\nmuch, that's a fact. You don't think the man who owns these flats is in\nit for charity, do you? 'Single ladies,' like me, have to give up. And\nthen there are other little grafts that wouldn't interest you. What\nchurch do you come from anyway?\"\n\n\"You mentioned it a little while ago.\"\n\n\"St. John's!\" She leaned back against the piano and laughed\nunrestrainedly. \"That's a good one, to think how straight I've been\ntalking to you.\"\n\n\"I'm much obliged to you,\" he said.\n\nAgain she gazed at him, now plainly perplexed.\n\n\"What are you giving me?\"\n\n\"I mean what I say,\" he answered. \"I am obliged to you for telling me\nthings I didn't know. And I appreciate--your asking me to stay.\"\n\nShe was sitting upright now, her expression changed, her breath came\nmore rapidly, her lips parted as she gazed at him.\n\n\"Do you know,\" she said, \"I haven't had anybody speak to me like that\nfor four years.\" Her voice betrayed excitement, and differed in tone,\nand she had cast off unconsciously the vulgarity of speech. At that\nmoment she seemed reminiscent of what she must once have been; and he\nfound himself going through an effort at reconstruction.\n\n\"Like what?\" he asked.\n\n\"Like a woman,\" she answered vehemently.\n\n\"My name is John Hodder,\" he said, \"and I live in the parish house, next\ndoor to the church. I should like to be your friend, if you will let me.\nIf I can be of any help to you now, or at any other time, I shall feel\nhappy. I promise not to preach,\" he added.\n\nShe got up abruptly, and went to the window. And when she turned to him\nagain, it was with something of the old bravado.\n\n\"You'd better leave me alone, I'm no good;\" she said. \"I'm much obliged\nto you, but I don't want any charity or probation houses in mine. And\nhonest work's a thing of the past for me--even if I could get a job.\nNobody would have me. But if they would, I couldn't work any more.\nI've got out of the hang of it.\" With a swift and decisive movement she\ncrossed the room, opened a cabinet on the wall, revealing a bottle and\nglasses.\n\n\"So you're bent upon going--downhill?\" he said.\n\n\"What can you do to stop it?\" she retorted defiantly, \"Give me\nreligion---I guess you'd tell me. Religion's all right for those on top,\nbut say, it would be a joke if I got it. There ain't any danger. But if\nI did, it wouldn't pay room-rent and board.\"\n\nHe sat mute. Once more the truth overwhelmed, the folly of his former\noptimism arose to mock him. What he beheld now, in its true aspect, was\na disease of that civilization he had championed...\n\nShe took the bottle from the cupboard and laid it on the table.\n\n\"What's the difference?\" she demanded. \"It's all over in a little while,\nanyway. I guess you'd tell me there was a hell. But if that's so, some\nof your church folks'll broil, too. I'll take my chance on it, if they\nwill.\" She looked at him, half in defiance, half in friendliness, across\nthe table. \"Say, you mean all right, but you're only wastin' time here.\nYou can't do me any good, I tell you, and I've got to get busy.\"\n\n\"May we not at least remain friends?\" he asked, after a moment.\n\nHer laugh was a little harsh.\n\n\"What kind of friendship would that be? You, a minister, and me a woman\non the town?\"\n\n\"If I can stand it, I should think you might.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't stand it,\" she answered.\n\nHe got up, and held out his hand. She stood seemingly irresolute, and\nthen took it.\n\n\"Good night,\" he said.\n\n\"Good night,\" she repeated nonchalantly.\n\nAs he went out of the door she called after him:\n\n\"Don't be afraid I'll worry the kid!\"\n\nThe stale odour of cigarette smoke with which the dim corridor was\ncharged intoxicated, threatened to overpower him. It seemed to be the\nreek of evil itself. A closing door had a sinister meaning. He hurried;\nobscurity reigned below, the light in the lower hall being out; fumbled\nfor the door-knob, and once in the street took a deep breath and mopped\nhis brow; but he had not proceeded half a block before he hesitated,\nretraced his steps, reentered the vestibule, and stooped to peer at the\ncards under the speaking tubes. Cheaply printed in large script, was the\nname of the tenant of the second floor rear,--MISS KATE MARCY....\n\nIn crossing Tower Street he was frightened by the sharp clanging of a\ngreat electric car that roared past him, aflame with light. His brain\nhad seemingly ceased to work, and he stumbled at the curb, for he was\nvery tired. The events of the day no longer differentiated themselves\nin his mind but lay, a composite weight, upon his heart. At length he\nreached the silent parish house, climbed the stairs and searched in his\npocket for the key of his rooms. The lock yielded, but while feeling for\nthe switch he tripped and almost fell over an obstruction on the floor.\n\nThe flooding light revealed his travelling-bags, as he had piled them,\npacked and ready to go to the station.\n\n\n\n\nVolume 4.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. WINTERBOURNE\n\n\nI\n\nHodder fell asleep from sheer exhaustion, awaking during the night at\noccasional intervals to recall chimerical dreams in which the events\nof the day before were reflected, but caricatured and distorted. Alison\nParr was talking to the woman in the flat, and both were changed, and\nyet he identified both: and on another occasion he saw a familiar figure\nsurrounded by romping, ragged children--a figure which turned out to be\nEldon Parr's!\n\nFinally he was aroused by what seemed a summons from the unknown--the\nprolonged morning whistle of the shoe factory. For a while he lay as one\nbenumbed, and the gradual realization that ensued might be likened to\nthe straining of stiffened wounds. Little by little he reconstructed,\nuntil the process became unbearable, and then rose from his bed with one\nobject in mind,--to go to Horace Bentley. At first--he seized upon the\nexcuse that Mr. Bentley would wish to hear the verdict of Dr. Jarvis,\nbut immediately abandoned it as dishonest, acknowledging the true\nreason, that in all the--world the presence of this one man alone might\nassuage in some degree the terror in his soul. For the first time in his\nlife, since childhood, he knew a sense of utter dependence upon another\nhuman being. He felt no shame, would make no explanation for his early\nvisit.\n\nHe turned up Tower, deliberately avoiding Dalton Street in its lower\npart, reached Mr. Bentley's door. The wrinkled, hospitable old darky\nactually seemed to radiate something of the personality with which he\nhad so long been associated, and Hodder was conscious of a surge of\nrelief, a return of confidence at sight of him. Yes, Mr. Bentley was at\nhome, in the dining room. The rector said he would wait, and not disturb\nhim.\n\n\"He done tole me to bring you out, sah, if you come,\" said Sam.\n\n\"He expects me?\" exclaimed Hodder, with a shock of surprise.\n\n\"That's what he done tole me, sah, to ax you kindly for to step out when\nyou come.\"\n\nThe sun was beginning to penetrate into the little back yard, where the\nflowers were still glistening with the drops of their morning bath; and\nMr. Bentley sat by the window reading his newspaper, his spectacles on\nhis nose, and a great grey cat rubbing herself against his legs. He rose\nwith alacrity.\n\n\"Good morning, sir,\" he said, and his welcome implied that early morning\nvisits were the most common and natural of occurrences. \"Sam, a plate\nfor Mr. Hodder. I was just hoping you would come and tell me what Dr.\nJarvis had said about the case.\"\n\nBut Hodder was not deceived. He believed that Mr. Bentley understood\nperfectly why he had come, and the knowledge of the old gentleman's\ncomprehension curiously added to his sense of refuge. He found himself\nseated once more at the mahogany table, permitting Sam to fill his cup\nwith coffee.\n\n\"Jarvis has given a favourable report, and he is coming this morning\nhimself, in an automobile, to take the boy out to the hospital.\"\n\n\"That is like Jarvis,\" was Mr. Bentley's comment. \"We will go there,\ntogether, after breakfast, if convenient for you,\" he added.\n\n\"I hoped you would,\" replied the rector. \"And I was going to ask you\na favour. I have a check, given me by a young lady to use at my\ndiscretion, and it occurred to me that Garvin might be willing to accept\nsome proposal from you.\" He thought of Nan Ferguson, and of the hope he\nlead expressed of finding some one in Dalton Street.\n\n\"I have been considering the matter,\" Mr. Bentley said. \"I have a friend\nwho lives on the trolley line a little beyond the hospital, a widow. It\nis like the country there, you know, and I think Mrs. Bledsoe could be\ninduced to take the Garvins. And then something can be arranged for him.\nI will find an opportunity to speak to him this morning.\"\n\nHodder sipped his coffee, and looked out at the morning-glories opening\nto the sun.\n\n\"Mrs. Garvin was alone last night. He had gone out shortly after we\nleft, and had not waited for the doctor. She was greatly worried.\"\n\nHodder found himself discussing these matters on which, an hour before,\nhe had feared to permit his mind to dwell. And presently, not without\nfeeling, but in a manner eliminating all account of his personal\nemotions, he was relating that climactic episode of the woman at the\npiano. The old gentleman listened intently, and in silence.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, when the rector had finished, \"that is my observation.\nMost of them are driven to the life, and held in it, of course, by a\nremorseless civilization. Individuals may be culpable, Mr. Hodder--are\nculpable. But we cannot put the whole responsibility on individuals.\"\n\n\"No,\" Hodder assented, \"I can see that now.\" He paused a moment, and as\nhis mind dwelt upon the scene and he saw again the woman standing before\nhim in bravado, the whole terrible meaning of her life and end flashed\nthrough him as one poignant sensation. Her dauntless determination to\naccept the consequence of her acts, her willingness to look her future\nin the face, cried out to him in challenge.\n\n\"She refused unconditionally,\" he said.\n\nMr. Bentley seemed to read his thought, divine his appeal.\n\n\"We must wait,\" he answered.\n\n\"Do you think?--\" Hodder began, and stopped abruptly.\n\n\"I remember another case, somewhat similar,\" said Mr. Bentley. \"This\nwoman, too, had the spirit you describe--we could do nothing with\nher. We kept an eye on her--or rather Sally Grover did--she deserves\ncredit--and finally an occasion presented itself.\"\n\n\"And the woman you speak of was--rehabilitated?\" Hodder asked. He\navoided the word \"saved.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. It was one of the fortunate cases. There are others which are\nnot so fortunate.\"\n\nHodder nodded.\n\n\"We are beginning to recognize that we are dealing, in, many instances,\nwith a disease,\" Mr. Bentley went on. \"I am far from saying that it\ncannot be cured, but sometimes we are forced to admit that the cure is\nnot within our power, Mr. Hodder.\"\n\nTwo thoughts struck the rector simultaneously, the revelation of what\nmight be called a modern enlightenment in one of Mr. Bentley's age,\nan indication of uninterrupted growth, of the sense of continued youth\nwhich had impressed him from the beginning; and, secondly, an intimation\nfrom the use of the plural pronoun we, of an association of workers\n(informal, undoubtedly) behind Mr. Bentley. While he was engaged in\nthese speculations the door opened.\n\n\"Heah's Miss Sally, Marse Ho'ace,\" said Sam.\n\n\"Good morning, Sally,\" said Mr. Bentley, rising from the table with his\ncustomary courtesy, \"I'm glad you came in. Let me introduce Mr. Hodder,\nof St. John's.\"\n\nMiss Grover had capability written all over her. She was a young woman\nof thirty, slim to spareness, simply dressed in a shirtwaist and a\ndark blue skirt; alert, so distinctly American in type as to give a\nsuggestion of the Indian. Her quick, deep-set eyes searched Hodder's\nface as she jerked his hand; but her greeting was cordial, and,\nmatter-of-fact. She stimulated curiosity.\n\n\"Well, Sally, what's the news?\" Mr. Bentley asked.\n\n\"Gratz, the cabinet-maker, was on the rampage again, Mr. Bentley. His\nwife was here yesterday when I got home from work, and I went over with\nher. He was in a beastly state, and all the niggers and children in the\nneighbourhood, including his own, around the shop. Fusel oil, labelled\nwhiskey,\" she explained, succinctly.\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"Took the bottle away from him,\" said Miss Grower. The simplicity of\nthis method, Holder thought, was undeniable. \"Stayed there until he came\nto. Then I reckon I scared him some.\"\n\n\"How?\" Mr. Bentley smiled.\n\n\"I told him he'd have to see you. He'd rather serve three months than\ndo that--said so. I reckon he would, too,\" she declared grimly. \"He's\nbetter than he was last year, I think.\" She thrust her hand in the\npocket of her skirt and produced some bills and silver, which she\ncounted. \"Here's three thirty-five from Sue Brady. I told her she hadn't\nany business bothering you, but she swears she'd spend it.\"\n\n\"That was wrong, Sally.\"\n\nMiss Grower tossed her head.\n\n\"Oh, she knew I'd take it, well enough.\"\n\n\"I imagine she did,\" Mr. Bentley replied, and his eyes twinkled. He rose\nand led the way into the library, where he opened his desk, produced a\nledger, and wrote down the amount in a fine hand.\n\n\"Susan Brady, three dollars and thirty-five cents. I'll put it in the\nsavings bank to-day. That makes twenty-two dollars and forty cents for\nSue. She's growing rich.\"\n\n\"Some man'll get it,\" said Sally.\n\n\"Sally,\" said Mr. Bentley, turning in his chair, \"Mr. Holder's been\ntelling me about a rather unusual woman in that apartment house just\nabove Fourteenth Street, on the south side of Dalton.\"\n\n\"I think I know her--by sight,\" Sally corrected herself. She appealed.\nto Holder. \"Red hair, and lots of it--I suppose a man would call it\nauburn. She must have been something of a beauty, once.\"\n\nThe rector assented, in some astonishment.\n\n\"Couldn't do anything with her, could you? I reckoned not. I've noticed\nher up and down Dalton Street at night.\"\n\nHolder was no longer deceived by her matter-of-fact tone.\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Mr. Holder,\" she went on, energetically, \"there's\nnot a particle of use running after those people, and the sooner you\nfind it out the less worry and trouble you give yourself.\"\n\n\"Mr. Holder didn't run after her, Sally,\" said Mr. Bentley, in gentle\nreproof.\n\nHolder smiled.\n\n\"Well,\" said Miss Grower, \"I've had my eye on her. She has a\nhistory--most of 'em have. But this one's out of the common. When\nthey're brazen like that, and have had good looks, you can nearly always\ntell. You've got to wait for something to happen, and trust to luck\nto be on the spot, or near it. It's a toss-up, of course. One thing is\nsure, you can't make friends with that kind if they get a notion you're\nup to anything.\"\n\n\"Sally, you must remember--\" Mr. Bentley began.\n\nHer tone became modified. Mr. Bentley was apparently the only human of\nwhom she stood in awe.\n\n\"All I meant was,\" she said, addressing the rector, \"that you've got to\nrun across 'em in some natural way.\"\n\n\"I understood perfectly, and I agree with you,\" Holder replied. \"I have\ncome, quite recently, to the same conclusion myself.\"\n\nShe gave him a penetrating glance, and he had to admit, inwardly, that a\ncertain satisfaction followed Miss Grower's approval.\n\n\"Mercy, I have to be going,\" she exclaimed, glancing at the black marble\nclock on the mantel. \"We've got a lot of invoices to put through\nto-day. See you again, Mr. Holder.\" She jerked his hand once more. \"Good\nmorning, Mr. Bentley.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Sally.\"\n\nMr. Bentley rose, and took his hat and gold-headed stick from the rack\nin the hall.\n\n\"You mustn't mind Sally,\" he said, when they had reached the sidewalk.\n\"Sometimes her brusque manner is not understood. But she is a very\nextraordinary woman.\"\n\n\"I can see that,\" the rector assented quickly, and with a heartiness\nthat dispelled all doubt of his liking for Miss Grower. Once more many\nquestions rose to his lips, which he suppressed, since Mr. Bentley\nvolunteered no information. Hodder became, in fact, so lost in\nspeculation concerning Mr. Bentley's establishment as to forget the\nerrand on which--they were bound. And Sally Grower's words, apropos\nof the woman in the flat, seemed but an energetic driving home of the\nsevere lessons of his recent experiences. And how blind he had been, he\nreflected, not to have seen the thing for himself! Not to have realized\nthe essential artificiality of his former method of approach! And then\nit struck him that Sally Grower herself must have had a history.\n\nMr. Bentley, too, was preoccupied.\n\nPresently, in the midst of these thoughts, Hodder's eyes were arrested\nby a crowd barring the sidewalk on the block ahead; no unusual sight\nin that neighbourhood, and yet one which aroused in him sensations of\nweakness and nausea. Thus were the hidden vice and suffering of these\nsinister places occasionally brought to light, exposed to the curious\nand morbid stares of those whose own turn might come on the morrow. It\nwas only by degrees he comprehended that the people were gathered in\nfront of the house to which they were bound. An ambulance was seen to\ndrive away: it turned into the aide street in front of them.\n\n\"A city ambulance!\" the rector exclaimed.\n\nMr. Bentley did not reply.\n\nThe murmuring group which overflowed the uneven brick pavement to the\nasphalt was characteristic: women in calico, drudges, women in wrappers,\nwith sleepy, awestricken faces; idlers, men and boys who had run out of\nthe saloons, whose comments were more audible and caustic, and a fringe\nof children ceaselessly moving on the outskirts. The crowd parted at\ntheir approach, and they reached the gate, where a burly policeman, his\nhelmet in his hand, was standing in the morning sunlight mopping his\nface with a red handkerchief. He greeted Mr. Bentley respectfully, by\nname, and made way for them to pass in.\n\n\"What is the trouble, Ryan?\" Mr. Bentley asked.\n\n\"Suicide, sir,\" the policeman replied. \"Jumped off the bridge this\nmorning. A tug picked him up, but he never came to--the strength wasn't\nin him. Sure it's all wore out he was. There was a letter on him, with\nthe home number, so they knew where to fetch him. It's a sad case, sir,\nwith the woman in there, and the child gone to the hospital not an hour\nago.\"\n\n\"You mean Garvin?\" Mr. Bentley demanded.\n\n\"It's him I mean, sir.\"\n\n\"We'd like to go in,\" said Mr. Bentley. \"We came to see them.\"\n\n\"You're welcome, air, and the minister too. It's only them I'm holdin'\nback,\" and the policeman shook his stick at the people.\n\nMr. Bentley walked up the steps, and took off his hat as he went through\nthe battered doorway. Hodder followed, with a sense of curious faces\nstaring at them from the thresholds as they passed; they reached the\nupper passage, and the room, and paused: the shutters were closed,\nthe little couch where the child had been was empty. On the bed lay a\nform--covered with a sheet, and beside it a woman kneeling, shaken by\nsobs, ceaselessly calling a name....\n\nA stout figure, hitherto unperceived, rose from a corner and came\nsilently toward them--Mrs. Breitmann. She beckoned to them, and they\nfollowed her into a room on the same floor, where she told them what she\nknew, heedless of the tears coursing ceaselessly down her cheeks.\n\nIt seemed that Mrs. Garvin had had a premonition which she had not\nwholly confided to the rector. She had believed her husband never would\ncome back; and early in the morning, in spite of all that Mrs. Breitmann\ncould do, had insisted at intervals upon running downstairs and scanning\nthe street. At half past seven Dr. Jarvis had come and himself carried\ndown the child and put him in the back of his automobile. The doctor had\nhad a nurse with him, and had begged the mother to accompany them to\nthe hospital, saying that he would send her back. But she would not be\npersuaded to leave the house. The doctor could not wait, and had finally\ngone off with little. Dicky, leaving a powder with Mrs. Breitmann for\nthe mother. Then she had become uncontrollable.\n\n\"Ach, it was terrible!\" said the kind woman. \"She was crazy, yes--she\nwas not in her mind. I make a little coffee, but she will not touch it.\nAll those things about her home she would talk of, and how good he was,\nand how she loved him more again than the child.\n\n\"Und then the wheels in the street, and she makes a cry and runs to\nsee--I cannot hold her....\"\n\n\"It would be well not to disturb her for a while,\" said Mr. Bentley,\nseating himself on one of the dilapidated chairs which formed apart of\nthe German woman's meagre furniture. \"I will remain here if you, Mr.\nHodder, will make the necessary arrangements for the funeral. Have you\nany objections, sir?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied the rector, and left the house, the occupants of\nwhich had already returned to the daily round of their lives: the rattle\nof dishes and the noise of voices were heard in the 'ci devant' parlour,\nand on the steps he met the little waif with the pitcher of beer; in\nthe street the boys who had gathered around the ambulance were playing\nbaseball. Hodder glanced up, involuntarily, at the window of the woman\nhe had visited the night before, but it was empty. He hurried along the\nlittered sidewalks to the drug store, where he telephoned an undertaker;\nand then, as an afterthought, telephoned the hospital. The boy had\narrived, and was seemingly no worse for the journey.\n\nAll this Hodder performed mechanically. Not until he was returning--not,\nindeed, until he entered the house did the whiff of its degrading,\nheated odours bring home to him the tragedy which it held, and he\ngrasped the banister on the stairs. The thought that shook him now\nwas of the cumulative misery of the city, of the world, of which this\nhistory on which he had stumbled was but one insignificant incident. But\nhe went on into Mrs. Breitmann's room, and saw Mr. Bentley still seated\nwhere he had left him. The old gentleman looked up at him.\n\n\"Mrs. Breitmann and I are agreed, Mr. Hodder, that Mrs. Garvin ought not\nto remain in there. What do you think?\"\n\n\"By all means, no,\" said the rector.\n\nThe German woman burst into a soliloquy of sympathy that became\nincoherent.\n\n\"She will not leave him,--nein--she will not come....\"\n\nThey went, the three of them, to the doorway of the death chamber and\nstood gazing at the huddled figure of the woman by the bedside. She had\nceased to cry out: she was as one grown numb under torture; occasionally\na convulsive shudder shook her. But when Mrs. Breitmann touched her,\nspoke to her, her grief awoke again in all its violence, and it was more\nby force than persuasion that she was finally removed. Mrs. Breitmann\nheld one arm, Mr. Bentley another, and between them they fairly carried\nher out, for she was frail indeed.\n\nAs for Hodder, something held him back--some dread that he could not at\nonce define. And while he groped for it, he stood staring at the man on\nthe bed, for the hand of love had drawn back the sheet from the face.\nThe battle was over of this poor weakling against the world; the\ntorments of haunting fear and hate, of drink and despair had triumphed.\nThe sight of the little group of toys brought up the image of the home\nin Alder Street as the wife had pictured it. Was it possible that this\nman, who had gone alone to the bridge in the night, had once been happy,\ncontent with life, grateful for it, possessed of a simple trust in his\nfellow-men--in Eldon Parr? Once more, unsummoned, came the memory of\nthat evening of rain and thunder in the boy's room at the top of the\ngreat horse in Park Street. He had pitied Eldon Parr then. Did he now?\n\nHe crossed the room, on tiptoe, as though he feared to wake once more\nthis poor wretch to his misery and hate, Gently he covered again the\nface with the sheet.\n\nSuddenly he knew the reason of his dread,--he had to face the woman!\nHe was a minister of Christ, it was his duty to speak to her, as he had\nspoken to others in the hour of sorrow and death, of the justice and\ngoodness of the God to whom she had prayed in the church. What should he\nsay, now? In an agony of spirit, he sat down on the little couch beside\nthe window and buried his face in his hands. The sight of poor Garvin's\nwhite and wasted features, the terrible contrast between this miserable\ntenement and the palace with its unseen pictures and porcelains and\ntapestries, brought home to him with indescribable poignancy his own\npredicament. He was going to ask this woman to be comforted by faith\nand trust in the God of the man who had driven her husband to death! He\nbeheld Eldon Parr in his pew complacently worshipping that God, who had\nrewarded him with riches and success--beheld himself as another man in\nhis white surplice acquiescing in that God, preaching vainly....\n\nAt last he got to his feet, went out of the room, reached the doorway\nof that other room and looked in. Mr. Bentley sat there; and the woman,\nwhose tears had ceased to flow, was looking up into his face.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\"The office ensuing,\" says the Book of Common Prayer, meaning the Burial\nof the Dead, \"is not to be used for any Unbaptized adult, any who die\nexcommunicate, or who have laid violent hands on themselves.\"\n\nHodder had bought, with a part of Nan Ferguson's money, a tiny plot in\na remote corner of Winterbourne Cemetery. And thither, the next morning,\nthe body of Richard Garvin was taken.\n\nA few mourners had stolen into the house and up the threadbare stairs\ninto the miserable little back room, somehow dignified as it had never\nbeen before, and laid their gifts upon the coffin. An odd and pitiful\nassortment they were--mourners and gifts: men and women whose only bond\nwith the man in life had been the bond of misery; who had seen him as he\nhad fared forth morning after morning in the hopeless search for work,\nand slunk home night after night bitter and dejected; many of whom had\nlistened, jeeringly perhaps, to his grievance against the world, though\nit were in some sort their own. Death, for them, had ennobled him. The\nlittle girl whom Hodder had met with the pitcher of beer came tiptoeing\nwith a wilted bunch of pansies, picked heaven knows where; stolen,\nmaybe, from one of the gardens of the West End. Carnations, lilies of\nthe valley, geraniums even--such were the offerings scattered loosely\non the lid until a woman came with a mass of white roses that filled\nthe room with their fragrance,--a woman with burnished red hair.\nHodder started as he recognized her; her gaze was a strange mixture of\neffrontery and--something else; sorrow did not quite express it. The\nvery lavishness of her gift brought to him irresistibly the reminder of\nanother offering. .... She was speaking.\n\n\"I don't blame him for what he done--I'd have done it, too, if I'd been\nhim. But say, I felt kind of bad when I heard it, knowing about the kid,\nand all. I had to bring something--\"\n\nInstinctively Hodder surmised that she was in doubt as to the acceptance\nof her flowers. He took them from her hand, and laid them at the foot of\nthe coffin.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, simply.\n\nShe stared at him a moment with the perplexity she had shown at times on\nthe night he visited her, and went out...\n\nFunerals, if they might be dignified by this name, were not infrequent\noccurrences in Dalton Street, and why this one should have been looked\nupon as of sufficient importance to collect a group of onlookers at\nthe gate it is difficult to say. Perhaps it was because of the seeming\ninterest in it of the higher powers--for suicide and consequent widows\nand orphans were not unknown there. This widow and this orphan were to\nbe miraculously rescued, were to know Dalton Street no more. The rector\nof a fashionable church, of all beings, was the agent in the miracle.\nThus the occasion was tinged with awe. As for Mr. Bentley, his was a\nfamiliar figure, and had been remarked in Dalton Street funerals before.\n\nThey started, the three mourners, on the long drive to the cemetery,\nthrough unfrequented streets lined with mediocre dwellings, interspersed\nwith groceries and saloons--short cuts known only to hearse drivers:\nthey traversed, for some distance, that very Wilderness road where Mr.\nBentley's old-fashioned mansion once had stood on its long green slope,\nframed by ancient trees; the Wilderness road, now paved with hot blocks\nof granite over which the carriage rattled; spread with car tracks,\nbordered by heterogeneous buildings of all characters and descriptions,\nbakeries and breweries, slaughter houses and markets, tumble-down\nshanties, weedy corner lots and \"refreshment-houses\" that announced\n\"Lager Beer, Wines and Liquors.\" At last they came to a region which was\nneither country nor city, where the road-houses were still in evidence,\nwhere the glass roofs of greenhouses caught the burning rays of the\nsun, where yards filled with marble blocks and half-finished tombstones\nappeared, and then they turned into the gates of Winterbourne.\n\nLike the city itself, there was a fashionable district in Winterbourne:\nunlike the city, this district remained stationary. There was no soot\nhere, and if there had been, the dead would not have minded it. They\npassed the Prestons and the Parrs; the lots grew smaller, the tombstones\nless pretentious; and finally they came to an open grave on a slope\nwhere the trees were still young, and where three men of the cemetery\nforce lifted the coffin from the hearse--Richard Garvin's pallbearers.\n\nJohn Hodder might not read the service, but there was none to tell him\nthat the Gospel of John was not written for this man. He stood an the\ngrass beside the grave, and a breeze from across the great river near by\nstirred the maple leaves above his head. \"I am the resurrection and the\nlife, saith the Lord; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet\nshall he live.\" Nor was there any canon to forbid the words of Paul:\n\"It is sown in corruption; it is raised in in corruption; it is sown in\ndishonour; it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness; it is raised\nin power; it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.\"\n\nThey laid the flowers on the fresh earth, even the white roses, and then\nthey drove back to the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. A SATURDAY AFTERNOON\n\n\nI\n\nThe sight of a certain old gentleman as he walked along the shady\nside of Twenty-second Street about two o'clock on a broiling Saturday\nafternoon in midsummer was one not easily to be forgotten. A younger\nman, tall and vigorous, clad in a thin suit of blue serge, walked by his\nside. They were followed by a shouting troop of small boys who overran\nthe pavements, and some of whom were armed with baseball bats. The big\ntrolley car was hailed by a dozen dirty little hands.\n\nEven the grumpy passengers were disarmed. The conductor took Mr.\nBentley's bill deprecatingly, as much as to say that the newly organized\nTraction Company--just out of the receivers' hands--were the Moloch, not\nhe, and rang off the fares under protest. And Mr. Bentley, as had been\nhis custom for years, sat down and took off his hat, and smiled so\nbenignly at those around him that they immediately began to talk, to\nhim. It was always irresistible, this desire to talk to Mr. Bentley. If\nyou had left your office irritated and out of sorts, your nerves worn to\nan edge by the uninterrupted heat, you invariably got off at your corner\nfeeling better. It was Phil Goodrich who had said that Horace Bentley\nhad only to get on a Tower Street car to turn it into a church. And if\nhe had chosen to establish that 'dernier cri' of modern civilization\nwhere ladies go who have 'welt-schmerz' without knowing why,--a\nsanitarium, he might have gained back again all the money he had lost in\ngiving his Grantham stock to Eldon Parr.\n\nLike the Pied Piper of Hamelin, he could have emptied Dalton Street of\nits children. In the first place, there was the irresistible inducement\nto any boy to ride several miles on a trolley without having this right\nchallenged by the irate guardian of the vehicle, without being summarily\nrequested to alight at twenty-five miles an hour: in the second place,\nthere was the soda water and sweet biscuit partaken of after the\nbaseball game in that pavilion, more imposing in one's eyes than the Taj\nMahal. Mr. Bentley would willingly have taken all Dalton Street. He had\nhis own 'welt-schmerz', though he did not go to a sanitarium to cure\nit; he was forced to set an age limit of ten, and then establish a high\ncourt of appeal; for there were boys whose biographies, if they are ever\nwritten, will be as hazy as those of certain world-wide celebrities who\nmight be mentioned concerning the date and exact spot of the entrance\nof their heroes into the light. The solemn protestations, the tears, the\nrecrimination even, brought pangs to the old gentleman's heart, for with\nall the will in the world he had been forced in the nature of things, to\nset a limit.\n\nThis limit had recently been increased by the unlooked-for appearance on\nthese excursions of the tall man in the blue serge suit, whose knowledge\nof the national game and of other matters of vital import to youth\nwas gratifying if sometimes disconcerting; who towered, an unruffled\nGulliver, over their Lilliputian controversies, in which bats were waved\nand fists brought into play and language used on the meaning of which\nthe Century dictionary is silent. On one former occasion, indeed, Mr.\nBentley had found moral suasion, affection, and veneration of no avail,\nand had had to invoke the friendly aid of a park policeman to quell one\nof these incipient riots. To Mr. Bentley baseball was as a sealed book.\nThe tall man's justice, not always worthy of the traditions of Solomon,\nhad in it an element of force. To be lifted off the ground by strong\narms at the moment you are about to dust the home plate with your\nadversary is humiliating, but effective. It gradually became apparent\nthat a decision was a decision. And one Saturday this inexplicable\nperson carried in his hand a mysterious package which, when opened,\nrevealed two pairs of diminutive boxing gloves. They instantly became\npopular.\n\nBy the time they had made the accidental and somewhat astounding\ndiscovery that he was a parson, they were willing to overlook it; in\nview, perhaps, of his compensating accomplishments. Instead of advising\nthem to turn the other cheek, he taught them uppercuts, feints, and\njabs, and on the proof of this unexpected acquaintance with a profession\nall of them openly admired, the last vestige of reserve disappeared. He\nwas accepted without qualifications.\n\n\n\nII\n\nAlthough the field to which they resorted was not in the most frequented\nsection of the park, pedestrians often passed that way, and sometimes\nlingered. Thus, towards the close of a certain Saturday in July, a young\nwoman walked out of the wood path and stood awhile gazing intently\nat the active figure striding among the diminutive, darting forms.\nPresently, with an amused expression, she turned her head to discover\nMr. Bentley, who sat on a green bench under a tree, his hat and stick on\nthe grass beside him. She was unaware that he had been looking at her.\n\n\"Aren't they having a good time!\" she said, and the genuine thrill in\nher voice betrayed a rare and unmistakable pleasure.\n\n\"Ah,\" replied Mr. Bentley, smiling back at her, \"you like to see them,\ntoo. Most persons do. Children are not meant for the city, my dear young\nlady, their natural home is in the woods and fields, and these little\nfellows are a proof of it. When they come out here, they run wild. You\nperceive,\" he added with a twinkle, as an expletive of unquestionable\nvigour was hurled across the diamond, \"they are not always so polite as\nthey might be.\"\n\nThe young woman smiled again, but the look she gave him was a puzzled\none. And then, quite naturally, she sank, down on the grass, on the\nother side of Mr. Bentley's hat, watching the game for a while in\nsilence.\n\n\"What a tyrant!\" she exclaimed. Another uproar had been quelled, and two\nvigorously protesting runners sent back to their former bases.\n\n\"Oh, a benevolent tyrant,\" Mr. Bentley corrected her. \"Mr. Hodder has\nthe gift of managing boys,--he understands them. And they require a\nstrong hand. His generation has had the training which mine lacked. In\nmy day, at college, we worked off our surplus energy on the unfortunate\nprofessors, and we carried away chapel bells and fought with the\ntownspeople.\"\n\nIt required some effort, she found, to imagine this benevolent looking\nold gentleman assaulting professors.\n\n\"Nowadays they play baseball and football, and box!\" He pointed to the\nboxing gloves on the grass. \"Mr. Hodder has taught them to settle their\ndifferences in that way; it is much more sensible.\"\n\nShe picked off the white clover-tops.\n\n\"So that is Mr. Hodder, of St. John's,\" she said.\n\n\"Ah, you know him, then?\"\n\n\"I've met him,\" she answered quietly. \"Are these children connected with\nhis church?\"\n\n\"They are little waifs from Dalton Street and that vicinity,\" said Mr.\nBentley. \"Very few of them, I should imagine, have ever been inside of a\nchurch.\"\n\nShe seemed surprised.\n\n\"But--is it his habit to bring them out here?\" The old gentleman beamed\non her, perhaps with the hint of a smile at her curiosity.\n\n\"He has found time for it, this summer. It is very good of him.\"\n\nShe refrained from comment on this remark, falling into reflection,\nleaning back, with one hand outstretched, on the grass. The game went on\nvociferously, the shrill lithe voices piercing the silence of the summer\nafternoon. Mr. Bentley's eyes continued to rest on her.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he inquired, after a while, \"are you not Alison Parr?\"\n\nShe glanced up at him, startled. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"I thought so, although I have not seen you since you were a little\ngirl. I knew your mother very well indeed, but it is too much to expect\nyou to remember me, after all this time. No doubt you have forgotten my\nname. I am Mr. Bentley.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bentley!\" she cried, sitting upright and gazing at him. \"How stupid\nof me not to have known you! You couldn't have been any one else.\"\n\nIt was the old gentleman's turn to start. She rose impulsively and sat\ndown on the bench beside him, and his hand trembled as he laid it in\nhers.\n\n\"Yes, my dear, I am still alive. But surely you cannot remember me,\nAlison?\"\n\nThe old look of almost stubborn honesty he recalled in the child came\ninto her eyes.\n\n\"I do--and I don't,\" she said, perplexed. \"It seemed to me as if I ought\nto have recognized you when I came up, and yet I hadn't the slightest\nnotion who you were. I knew you were somebody.\"\n\nHe shook his head, but did not speak.\n\n\"But you have always been a fact in my existence--that is what I want\nto say,\" she went on. \"It must be possible to remember a person and not\nrecognize him, that is what I feel. I can remember you coming to our\nhouse in Ransome Street, and how I looked forward to your visits. And\nyou used to have little candy beans in your pockets,\" she cried. \"Have\nyou now?\"\n\nHis eyes were a little dimmed as he reached, smilingly, into the\nskirts of a somewhat shiny but scrupulously brushed coat and produced a\nbrightly colored handful. She took one, and put it in her mouth:\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"how good they were--Isn't it strange how a taste brings\nback events? I can remember it all as if it were yesterday, and how I\nused to sit on your knee, and mother would tell me not to bother you.\"\n\n\"And now--you are grown,\" he said.\n\n\"Something more than grown,\" she smiled. \"I was thirty-one in May. Tell\nme,\" she asked, choosing another of the beans which he still absently\nheld, \"do you get them for these?\" And she nodded toward the Dalton\nStreet waifs.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"they are children, too.\"\n\n\"I can remember,\" she said, after a pause, \"I can remember my mother\nspeaking of you to me the year she died. I was almost grown, then. It\nwas after we had moved up to Park Street, and her health had already\nbegun to fail. That made an impression on me, but I have forgotten\nwhat she said--it was apropos of some recollection. No--it was a\nphotograph--she was going over some old things.\" Alison ceased speaking\nabruptly, for the pain in Mr. Bentley's remarkable grey eyes had\nnot escaped her. What was it about him? Why could she not recall?\nLong-forgotten, shadowy episodes of the past tormented her, flitted\nprovokingly through her mind--ungrasped: words dropped in her presence\nwhich had made their impression, but the gist of which was gone. Why\nhad Mr. Bentley ceased coming to the house? So strongly did she feel his\npresence now that the thought occurred to her,--perhaps her mother had\nnot wished her to forget him!\n\n\"I did not suspect,\" she heard him saying, \"that you would go out into\nthe world and create the beautiful gardens of which I have heard. But\nyou had no lack of spirit in those days, too.\"\n\n\"I was a most disagreeable child, perverse,--cantankerous--I can hear\nmy mother saying it! As for the gardens--they have given me something to\ndo, they have kept me out of mischief. I suppose I ought to be thankful,\nbut I still have the rebellious streak when I see what others have done,\nwhat others are doing, and I sometimes wonder what right I ever had to\nthink that I might create something worth while.\"\n\nHe glanced at her quickly as she sat with bent head.\n\n\"Others put a higher value on what you have done.\"\n\n\"Oh, they don't know--\" she exclaimed.\n\nIf something were revealed to him by her tone, he did not betray it, but\nwent on cheerfully.\n\n\"You have been away a long time, Alison. It must interest you to come\nback, and see the changes in our Western civilization. We are moving\nvery rapidly--in certain directions,\" he corrected himself.\n\nShe appraised his qualification.\n\n\"In certain directions,--yes. But they are little better in the East. I\nhave scarcely been back,\" she added, \"since I went to Paris to study.\nI have often thought I should like to return and stay awhile, only--I\nnever seemed to get time. Now I am going over a garden for my father\nwhich was one of my first efforts, and which has always reproached me.\"\n\n\"And you do not mind the heat?\" he asked. \"Those who go East to live\nreturn to find our summers oppressive.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm a salamander, I think,\" Alison laughed.\n\nThus they sat chatting, interrupted once or twice by urchins too small\nto join in the game, who came running to Mr. Bentley and stood staring\nat Alison as at a being beyond the borders of experience: and she\nwould smile at them quite as shyly,--children being beyond her own. Her\nimagination was as keen, as unspoiled as a child's, and was stimulated\nby a sense of adventure, of the mystery which hung about this fine old\ngentleman who betrayed such sentiment for a mother whom she had loved\nand admired and still secretly mourned. Here, if there had been no\nother, was a compelling bond of sympathy....\n\nThe shadows grew longer, the game broke up. And Hodder, surrounded by\nan argumentative group keeping pace with him, came toward them from the\nfield; Alison watched him curiously as he turned this way and that to\nanswer the insistent questions with which he was pelted, and once she\nsaw him stride rapidly after a dodging delinquent and seize him by the\ncollar amidst piercing yells of approval, and derision for the rebel.\n\n\"It's remarkable how he gets along with them,\" said Mr. Bentley, smiling\nat the scene. \"Most of them have never known what discipline is.\"\n\nThe chorus approached. And Hodder, recognizing her, dropped the collar\nhe held: A young woman conversing with Mr. Bentley--was no unusual\nsight,--he had made no speculations as to this one's identity. He left\nthe boys, and drew near.\n\n\"You know Miss Parr, I believe,\" the old gentleman said.\n\nHodder took her hand. He had often tried to imagine his feelings if he\nshould meet her again: what he should do and say,--what would be their\nfooting. And now he had no time to prepare....\n\n\"It is so strange,\" she said, with that note of wonder at life in her\nvoice which he recalled so well, \"that I should have come across Mr.\nBentley here after so many years. How many years, Mr. Bentley?\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" he protested, \"my measurements would not be yours.\"\n\n\"It is better for both of us not to say, Alison declared, laughingly.\n\n\"You knew Mr. Bentley?\" asked Hodder, astonished.\n\n\"He was a very dear friend of my mother's, although I used to\nappropriate him when he came to our house. It was when we lived in\nRansome Street, ages ago. But I don't think Mr. Bentley has grown a bit\nolder.\"\n\n\"He is one of the few who have found the secret of youth,\" said the\nrector.\n\nBut the old gentleman had moved off into the path, or perhaps it would\nbe more accurate to say that he was carried off by the swarm which\nclustered around him, two smaller ones tugging at his hand, and all\nintent upon arriving at the soda-water pavilion near the entrance. They\nhad followed him with their eyes, and they saw him turn around and smile\nat them, helplessly. Alison presented a perplexed face to Hodder.\n\n\"Does he bring them here,--or you?\" she asked.\n\n\"I--\" he hesitated. \"Mr. Bentley has done this every Saturday afternoon\nfor years,\" he said, \"I am merely one of them.\"\n\nShe looked at him quickly. They had started to follow, in the cool path\nbeneath the forest trees. Restraint fell upon them, brought about by the\nmemory of the intimacy of their former meeting, further complicated on\nHodder's part by his new attitude toward her father, and his finding\nher in the company, of all persons, of Mr. Bentley. Unuttered queries\npressed on the minds of both.\n\n\"Tell me about Mr. Bentley,\" she said.\n\nHodder hesitated.\n\n\"I scarcely know where to begin,\" he replied, yet smiling at the\ncharacteristic abruptness of her question. The modulations of her voice\nrevealed again the searching, inquisitive spirit within her, and his\nresponded to the intensity of the interest in Mr. Bentley.\n\n\"Begin anywhere.\"\n\n\"Anywhere?\" he repeated, seeking to gain time.\n\n\"Yes--anywhere,\" she said impatiently.\n\n\"Well, he lives in Dalton Street, if you recall what kind of a place\nthat is\" (she nodded), \"and he is known from one end of it to the\nother.\"\n\n\"I see what he is--he is the most extraordinary person I have ever\nknown. Just to talk to him gives one such a queer feeling of--of\ndissatisfaction with one's self, and seeing him once more seems to have\nhalf revived in me a whole series of dead memories. And I have been\ntrying to think, but it is all so tantalizing. There is some mystery\nabout him,\" she insisted. \"He disappeared suddenly, and my mother never\nmentioned him but once afterward, but other persons have spoken of him\nsince--I forget who. He was so well known, and he used to go to St.\nJohn's.\"\n\n\"Yes, he used to go to St. John's.\"\n\n\"What happened to him--do you know? The reason he stopped coming to our\nhouse was some misunderstanding with my father, of course. I am positive\nmy mother never changed her feelings toward him.\"\n\n\"I can only tell you what he has told me, which is all I\nknow--authoritatively,\" Hodder replied. How could he say to her that her\nfather had ruined Mr. Bentley? Indeed, with a woman of her fearlessness\nand honesty--and above all, her intuition,--he felt the cruelty of his\nposition keenly. Hodder did not relish half truths; and he felt that,\nhowever scant his intercourse in the future might be with Alison Parr,\nhe would have liked to have kept it on that basis of frankness in which\nit had begun. But the exact stage of disillusionment she had reached in\nregard to Eldon Parr was unknown to him, and he feared that a further\nrevelation might possibly sever the already precarious tie between\nfather and daughter.\n\nHe recounted, therefore, that Mr. Bentley had failed; and how he had\nbefore that given much of his estate away in charity, how he had been\nunable to keep his pew in St. John's, and had retired to the house in\nDalton Street.\n\nFor some moments after he had finished Alison did not reply.\n\n\"What is his number in Dalton Street?\" she asked.\n\nHodder informed her.\n\nHe could not read in her face whether she suspected that he could have\ntold her more. And in spite of an inordinate, human joy in being again\nin her presence, his desire to hide from her that which had taken\nplace within him, and the inability he felt to read his future, were\ninstinctive: the more so because of the very spontaneity they had\nachieved at their first meeting. As a man, he shrank from confessing\nto her, however indirectly, the fact that she herself was so vital an\nelement in his disillusionment. For the conversation in the garden had\nbeen the immediate cause of the inner ferment ending in his resolution\nto go away, and had directed him, by logical steps, to the encounter in\nthe church with Mrs. Garvin.\n\n\"You have not yet finished the garden?\" he asked. \"I imagined you back\nin the East by this time.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am procrastinating,\" she replied. \"It is a fit of sheer laziness.\nI ought to be elsewhere, but I was born without a conscience. If I had\none I should try to quiet it by reminding it that I am fulfilling a\nlong-delayed promise--I am making a garden for Mrs. Larrabbee. You know\nher, of course, since she is a member of your congregation.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know her,\" he assented. And his mind was suddenly filled with\nvivid colour,--cobalt seas, and arsenic-green spruces with purple cones,\ncardinal-striped awnings that rattled in the salt breeze, and he saw\nonce more the panorama of the life which had passed from him and the\nwoman in the midst of it. And his overwhelming thought was of relief\nthat he had somehow escaped. In spite of his unhappiness now, he would\nnot have gone back. He realized for the first time that he had been\nnearer annihilation then than to-day.\n\n\"Grace isn't here to bother me with the ideas she has picked up in\nEurope and catalogued,\" Alison continued.\n\n\"Catalogued!\" Hodder exclaimed, struck by the pertinency of the word.\n\n\"Yes. Did you ever know anybody who had succeeded half so well\nin piecing together and absorbing into a harmonized whole all the\ndivergent, artificial elements that enter into the conventional world\nto-day? Her character might be called a triumph of synthesis. For she\nhas actually achieved an individuality--that is what always surprises\nme when I think of her. She has put the puzzle picture together, she has\nbecome a person.\"\n\nHe remembered, with a start, that this was the exact word Mrs. Larrabbee\nhad used about Alison Parr. If he had searched the world, he could not\nhave found a greater contrast than that between these two women. And\nwhen she spoke again, he was to be further struck by her power of\nlogical insight.\n\n\"Grace wants me because she thinks I have become the fashion--for\nthe same reason that Charlotte Plimpton wants me. Only there is this\ndifference--Grace will know the exact value of what I shall have done.\nNot that she thinks me a Le Notre\"--Alison laughed--\"What I mean is, she\nsees behind, she sees why it is fashionable to have a garden, since she\nhas worked out the values of that existence. But there!\" Alison added,\nwith a provocative touch that did not escape him, \"I am picking your\nparishioners to pieces again.\"\n\n\"You have more right than I,\" he replied, \"they have been your friends\nsince childhood.\"\n\n\"I thought you had gone away,\" she said.\n\n\"Why?\" he demanded. Had she been to church again?\n\n\"My father told me before he left that you were to take a cruise with\nhim on the yacht he has chartered.\"\n\n\"He wrote me from New York--I was unable to go,\" Hodder said slowly.\n\nHe felt her gaze upon him, but resolutely refused to meet it.... They\nwalked on in silence until they came to the more open spaces near the\nedge of the Park, thronged that Saturday evening by crowds which had\nsought the city's breathing space. Perfect trees cast long, fantastic\nshadows across the lawns, fountains flung up rainbows from the midst of\nlakes; children of the tenements darted hither and thither, rolled and\nromped on the grass; family parties picnicked everywhere, and a very\nbabel of tongues greeted the ear--the languages of Europe from Sweden to\nItaly.\n\nSuddenly an exclamation from her aroused and thrilled him.\n\n\"Isn't it wonderful how happy they are, and with what simple pleasures\nthey are satisfied! I often come over here on Saturdays and Sundays,\njust to talk to them.\"\n\n\"Talk to them!\" he echoed stupidly. \"In their own languages?\"\n\n\"Oh, I know a little German and Italian, though I can't lay claim to\nCzech,\" she answered gayly. \"Why are you so surprised that I should\npossess such modest accomplishments?\"\n\n\"It's not the accomplishments.\" He hesitated.\n\n\"No. You are surprised that I should be interested in humanity.\"\nShe stood facing him. \"Well, I am,\" she said, half humorously, half\ndefiantly. \"I believe I am more interested in human beings than in\nanything else in the world--when they are natural, as these people are\nand when they will tell one their joys and their troubles and their\nopinions.\"\n\n\"Enthusiasm, self-assertion, had as usual, transformed her, and he saw\nthe colour glowing under her olive skin. Was she accusing him of a lack\nof frankness?\n\n\"And why,\" he asked, collecting himself, \"did you think--\" he got no\nfurther.\n\n\"It's because you have an idea that I'm a selfish Epicurean, if that\nisn't tautology--because I'm interested in a form of art, the rest of\nthe world can go hang. You have a prejudice against artists. I wish I\nreally were one, but I'm not.\"\n\nThis speech contained so many surprises for him that he scarcely knew\nhow to answer it.\n\n\"Give me a little time,\" he begged, \"and perhaps I'll get over my\nprejudices. The worst of them, at any rate. You are helping me to do\nso.\" He tried to speak lightly, but his tone was more serious in the\nnext sentence. \"It seems to me personally that you have proved your\nconcern for your fellow-creatures.\"\n\nHer colour grew deeper, her manner changed.\n\n\"That gives me the opportunity to say something I have hoped to say,\never since I saw you. I hoped I should see you again.\"\n\n\"You are not going away soon?\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe words were spoken before he grasped their significance.\n\n\"Not at once. I don't know how long I shall stay,\" she answered\nhurriedly, intent upon what was in her mind. \"I have thought a great\ndeal about what I said to you that afternoon, and I find it more than\never difficult to excuse myself. I shan't attempt to. I merely mean to\nask you to forgive me.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to forgive,\" he assured her, under the influence of\nthe feeling she had aroused.\n\n\"It's nice of you to say so, and to take it as you did--nicer than I can\nexpress. I am afraid I shall never learn to appreciate that there may be\nother points of view toward life than my own. And I should have realized\nand sympathized with the difficulties of your position, and that you\nwere doing the best under the circumstances.\"\n\n\"No,\" he exclaimed, \"don't say that! Your other instinct was the truer\none, if indeed you have really changed it--I don't believe you have.\" He\nsmiled at her again. \"You didn't hurt my feelings, you did me a service.\nI told you so at the time, and I meant it. And, more than that, I\nunderstood.\"\n\n\"You understood--?\"\n\n\"You were not criticizing me, you were--what shall I say?--merely trying\nto iron out some of the inconsistencies of life. Well, you helped me\nto iron out some of the inconsistencies of my own. I am profoundly\ngrateful.\"\n\nShe gazed at him, puzzled. But he did not, he could not enlighten her.\nSome day she would discover what he meant.\n\n\"If so, I am glad,\" she said, in a low voice.\n\nThey were standing in the midst of the crowd that thronged around the\npavilion. An urchin caught hold of the rector's coat.\n\n\"Here he is! Say, Mr. Hodder, ain't you going to have any sody?\"\n\n\"Certainly we are,\" he replied, returning Alison's faint smile.... In\nthe confusion that followed he caught a glimpse of her talking to Mr.\nBentley; and later, after he had taken her hand, his eyes followed her\nfigure wending its way in the evening light through the groups toward\nPark Street, and he saw above the tree-tops the red tiled roof of the\ngreat house in which she was living, alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. THE CRUCIBLE\n\n\nI\n\nFor better or worse John Hodder had flung his treasured beliefs into the\ncrucible, and one by one he watched them crumble and consume away. None\nbut his own soul knew what it cost him to make the test; and some times,\nin the early stages of it, he would cast down his book under the lamp\nand walk for hours in the night. Curiosity, and the despair of one who\nis lost impelled him to persist.\n\nIt had been said of him that he had a talent for the law, and he now\ndiscovered that his mind, once freed, weighed the evidence with a\npitiless logic, paid its own tribute--despite the anguish of the\nheart--to the pioneers of truth whose trail it followed into the\nUnknown, who had held no Mystery more sacred than Truth itself, who had\ndared to venture into the nothingness between the whirling worlds.\n\nHe considered them, those whirling worlds, at night. Once they had\nbeen the candles of Jehovah, to light the path of his chosen nation,\nto herald the birth of his Son. And now? How many billions of blind,\nstruggling creatures clung to them? Where now was this pin-point\nof humanity, in the midst of an appalling spectacle of a grinding,\nremorseless nature?\n\nAnd that obscure Event on which he had staked his hopes? Was He, as John\nhad written, the First Born of the Universe, the Word Incarnate of a\nsystem that defied time and space, the Logos of an outworn philosophy?\nWas that Universe conscious, as Berkeley had declared, or the blind\nmonster of substance alone, or energy, as some modern scientists\nbrutally and triumphantly maintained? Where was the Spirit that breathed\nin it of hope?\n\nSuch were some of the questions that thronged for solution. What was\nmind, what spirit? an attenuated vapour of the all-pervading substance?\n\nHe could not permit himself to dwell on these thoughts--madness lay\nthat way. Madness, and a watching demon that whispered of substance, and\nsought to guide his wanderings in the night. Hodder clung to the shell\nof reality, to the tiny panorama of the visible and the finite, to the\ninfinitesimal gropings that lay recorded before him on the printed page.\nLet him examine these first, let him discover--despite the price--what\nwarrant the mind of man (the only light now vouchsafed to him in his\ndarkness) gave him to speculate and to hope concerning the existence of\na higher, truer Reality than that which now tossed and wounded him. It\nwere better to know.\n\nScarcely had the body been lifted from the tree than the disputes\ncommenced, the adulterations crept in. The spontaneity, the fire and\nzeal of the self-sacrificing itinerant preachers gave place to the\nparalyzing logic then pervading the Roman Empire, and which had sent\nits curse down the ages to the modern sermon; the geometrical rules of\nEuclid were made to solve the secrets of the universe. The simple faith\nof the cross which had inspired the martyr along the bloody way from\nEphesus to the Circus at Rome was formalized by degrees into philosophy:\nthe faith of future ages was settled by compromises, by manipulation,\nby bribery in Councils of the Church which resembled modern political\nconventions, and in which pagan Emperors did not hesitate to exert their\ninfluence over the metaphysical bishops of the factions. Recriminations,\nexecutions, murders--so the chronicles ran.\n\nThe prophet, the idealist disappeared, the priest with his rites and\nceremonies and sacrifices, his power to save and damn, was once more in\npossession of the world.\n\nThe Son of Man was degraded into an infant in his mother's arms. An\nunhealthy, degenerating asceticism, drawn from pagan sources, began with\nthe monks and anchorites of Egypt and culminated in the spectacle of\nSimeon's pillar. The mysteries of Eleusis, of Attis, Mithras, Magna\nMater and Isis developed into Christian sacraments--the symbol became\nthe thing itself. Baptism the confession of the new life, following\nthe customs of these cults, became initiation; and from the same\nsuperstitious origins, the repellent materialistic belief that to eat\nof the flesh and drink of the blood of a god was to gain immortality:\nimmortality of the body, of course.\n\n\nAh, when the superstitions of remote peoples, the fables and myths,\nwere taken away; when the manufactured history and determinism of the\nIsraelites from the fall of man to the coming of that Messiah, whom the\nJews crucified because he failed to bring them their material Kingdom,\nwere discredited; when the polemic and literal interpretations of\nevangelists had been rejected, and the pious frauds of tampering monks;\nwhen the ascetic Buddhism was removed; the cults and mysteries, the\ndogmas of an ancient naive philosophy discarded; the crude science of a\nPtolemy who conceived the earth as a flat terrestrial expanse and hell\nas a smoking pit beneath proved false; the revelation of a Holy City of\njasper and gold and crystal, the hierarchy with its divine franchise to\nsave and rule and conquer,--when all these and more were eliminated from\nChristianity, what was left?\n\nHodder surveyed the ruins. And his mind recalled, that Sunday of rain\nin New York which had been the turning-point in his life, when he had\nlistened to the preacher, when he had walked the streets unmindful\nof the wet, led on by visions, racked by fears. And the same terror\nreturned to him now after all the years of respite, tenfold increased,\nof falling in the sight of man from the topmost tower.\n\nWhat was to become of him, now that the very driving power of life was\ngone? Where would he go? to what might he turn his hand, since all were\nvanity and illusion? Careers meant nothing, had any indeed been possible\nto a man forty, left staring at stark reality after the rainbow had\nvanished. Nineveh had mocked and conquered him who had thought himself\na conqueror. Self flew back and swung on its central pivot and took\ncommand. His future, his fate, what was to become of him. Who else now\nwas to be considered? And what was to restrain him from reaching out his\nhand to pluck the fruit which he desired?...\n\n\n\nII\n\nWhat control from the Unknown is this which now depresses and now\nreleases the sensitive thing called the soul of man, and sends it upward\nagain until the green light of hope shines through the surface water?\nHe might have grown accustomed, Holder thought, to the obscurity of\nthe deeps; in which, after a while, the sharp agony of existence became\ndulled, the pressure benumbing. He was conscious himself, at such times,\nof no inner recuperation. Something drew him up, and he would find\nhimself living again, at length to recognize the hand if not to\ncomprehend the power.\n\nThe hand was Horace Bentley's.\n\nWhat was the source of that serenity which shone on the face of his\nfriend? Was it the light of faith? Faith in--what? Humanity, Mr. Bentley\nhad told him on that first evening when they had met: faith in a world\nfilled with cruelties, disillusionments, lies, and cheats! On what\nAuthority was it based? Holder never asked, and no word of theology ever\ncrossed Mr. Bentley's lips; not by so much as a sign did he betray any\nknowledge he may have had of the drama taking place in Holder's soul; no\ncomment escaped him on the amazing anomalies of the life the rector was\nleading, in the Church but not of it.\n\nIt was only by degrees Holder came to understand that no question would\nbe asked, and the frequency of his visits to Dalton Street increased. He\ndirected his steps thither sometimes hurriedly, as though pursued, as to\na haven from a storm. And a haven it was indeed! At all hours of the\nday he came, and oftener in the night, in those first weeks, and if\nMr. Bentley were not at home the very sight of the hospitable old darky\nbrought surging up within him a sense of security, of, relief; the\nlibrary itself was filled with the peace of its owner. How many\nothers had brought their troubles here, had been lightened on the very\nthreshold of this sanctuary!\n\nGradually Hodder began to realize something of their numbers. Gradually,\nas he was drawn more and more into the network of the relationships of\nthis extraordinary man,--nay, as he inevitably became a part of that\nnetwork,--a period of bewilderment ensued. He found himself involved,\nand quite naturally, in unpremeditated activities, running errands,\nforming human ties on a human basis. No question was asked, no\ncredentials demanded or rejected. Who he was made no difference--he was\na friend of Horace Bentley's. He had less time to read, less time to\nthink, to scan the veil of his future.\n\nHe had run through a score of volumes, critical, philosophical,\nscientific, absorbing their contents, eagerly anticipating their\nconclusions; filled, once he had begun, with a mania to destroy, a\nsavage determination to leave nothing,--to level all....\n\nAnd now, save for the less frequent relapsing moods, he had grown\nstrangely unconcerned about his future, content to live in the presence\nof this man; to ignore completely the aspects of a life incomprehensible\nto the few, besides Mr. Bentley, who observed it.\n\nWhat he now mostly felt was relief, if not a faint self-congratulation\nthat he had had the courage to go through with it, to know the worst.\nAnd he was conscious even, at times, of a faint reviving sense of\nfreedom he had not known since the days at Bremerton. If the old dogmas\nwere false, why should he regret them? He began to see that, once he had\nsuspected their falsity, not to have investigated were to invite decay;\nand he pictured himself growing more unctuous, apologetic, plausible.\nHe had, at any rate, escaped the more despicable fate, and if he went to\npieces now it would be as a man, looking the facts in the face,--not as\na coward and a hypocrite.\n\nLate one afternoon, when he dropped in at Mr. Bentley's house, he was\ninformed by Sam that a lady was awaiting Mr. Bentley in the library. As\nHodder opened the door he saw a tall, slim figure of a woman with her\nback toward him. She was looking at the photographs on the mantel.\n\nIt was Alison Parr!\n\nHe remembered now that she had asked for Mr. Bentley's number, but it\nhad never occurred to him that he might one day find her here. And as\nshe turned he surprised in her eyes a shyness he had never seen in them\nbefore. Thus they stood gazing at each other a moment before either\nspoke.\n\n\"Oh, I thought you were Mr. Bentley,\" she said.\n\n\"Have you been waiting long?\" he asked.\n\n\"Three quarters of an hour, but I haven't minded it. This is such an\ninteresting room, with its pictures and relics and books. It has a\nsoothing effect, hasn't it? To come here is like stepping out of the\nturmoil of the modern world into a peaceful past.\"\n\nHe was struck by the felicity of her description.\n\n\"You have been here before?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.\" She settled herself in the armchair; and Hodder, accepting the\nsituation, took the seat beside her. \"Of course I came, after I had\nfound out who Mr. Bentley was. The opportunity to know him again--was\nnot to be missed.\"\n\n\"I can understand that,\" he assented.\n\n\"That is, if a child can even be said to know such a person as Mr.\nBentley. Naturally, I didn't appreciate him in those days--children\nmerely accept, without analyzing. And I have not yet been able to\nanalyze,--I can only speculate and consider.\"\n\nHer enthusiasm never failed to stir and excite Hodder. Nor would he have\nthought it possible that a new value could be added to Mr. Bentley in\nhis eyes. Yet so it was.\n\nHe felt within him, as she spoke, the quickening of a stimulus.\n\n\"When I came in a little while ago,\" Alison continued, \"I found a woman\nin black, with such a sweet, sad face. We began a conversation. She had\nbeen through a frightful experience. Her husband had committed suicide,\nher child had been on the point of death, and she says that she lies\nawake nights now thinking in terror of what might have happened to\nher if you and Mr. Bentley hadn't helped her. She's learning to be a\nstenographer. Do you remember her?--her name is Garvin.\"\n\n\"Did she say--anything more?\" Hodder anxiously demanded.\n\n\"No,\" said Alison, surprised by his manner, \"except that Mr. Bentley\nhad found her a place to live, near the hospital, with a widow who was\na friend of his. And that the child was well, and she could look life\nin the face again. Oh, it is terrible to think that people all around us\nare getting into such straits, and that we are so indifferent to it!\"\n\nHodder did not speak at once. He was wondering, now that she had renewed\nher friendship with Mr. Bentley, whether certain revelations on her part\nwere not inevitable....\n\nShe was regarding him, and he was aware that her curiosity was aflame.\nAgain he wondered whether it were curiosity or--interest.\n\n\"You did not tell me, when we met in the Park, that you were no longer\nat St. John's.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Bentley tell you?\"\n\n\"No. He merely said he saw a great deal of you. Martha Preston told\nme. She is still here, and goes to church occasionally. She was much\nsurprised to learn that you were in the city.\n\n\"I am still living in the parish house,\" he said. \"I am--taking my\nvacation.\"\n\n\"With Mr. Bentley?\" Her eyes were still on his face.\n\n\"With Mr. Bentley,\" he replied.\n\nHe had spoken without bitterness. Although there had indeed been\nbitterness in his soul, it passed away in the atmosphere of Mr.\nBentley's house. The process now taking place in him was the same\ncomplication of negative and positive currents he had felt in her\npresence before. He was surprised to find that his old antipathy to\nagnosticism held over, in her case; to discover, now, that he was by\nno means, as yet, in view of the existence of Horace Bentley, to go the\nfull length of unbelief! On the other hand, he saw that she had divined\nmuch of what had happened to him, and he felt radiating from her a\nsympathetic understanding which seemed almost a claim. She had a claim,\nalthough he could not have said of what it was constituted. Their\npersonal relationship bore responsibilities. It suddenly came over him,\nin fact, that the two persons who in all the world were nearest him were\nherself and Mr. Bentley! He responded, scarce knowing why he did so, to\nthe positive current.\n\n\"With Mr. Bentley,\" he repeated, smiling, and meeting her eyes, \"I have\nbeen learning something about the actual conditions of life in a modern\ncity.\"\n\nShe bent a little toward him in one of those spontaneous movements that\ncharacterized her.\n\n\"Tell me--what is his life?\" she asked. \"I have seen so little of it,\nand he has told me nothing himself. At first, in the Park, I saw only\na kindly old gentleman, with a wonderful, restful personality, who had\nbeen a dear friend of my mother's. I didn't connect those boys with him.\nBut since then--since I have been here twice, I have seen other things\nwhich make me wonder how far his influence extends.\" She paused.\n\n\"I, too, have wondered,\" said the rector, thoughtfully. \"When I met\nhim, I supposed he were merely living in simple relationships with his\nneighbours here in Dalton Street, but by degrees I have discovered that\nhis relationships are as wide as the city itself. And they have grown\nnaturally--by radiation, as it were. One incident has led to another,\none act of kindness to another, until now there seems literally no end\nto the men and women with whom he is in personal touch, who are ready to\ndo anything in their power for him at any time. It is an institution,\nin fact, wholly unorganized, which in the final analysis is one man. And\nthere is in it absolutely nothing of that element which has come to be\nknown as charity.\"\n\nAlison listened with parted lips.\n\n\"To give you an example,\" he went on, gradually be coming fired by his\nsubject, by her absorption, \"since you have mentioned Mrs. Garvin, I\nwill tell you what happened in that case. It is typical of many. It was\na question of taking care of this woman, who was worn out and crushed,\nuntil she should recover sufficiently to take care of herself. Mr.\nBentley did not need any assistance from me to get the boy into the\nhospital--Dr. Jarvis worships him. But the mother. I might possibly have\ngot her into an institutional home--Mr. Bentley did better than that,\nfar better. On the day of the funeral we went directly from the cemetery\nto the house of a widow who owns a little fruit farm beyond the Park.\nHer name is Bledsoe, and it is not an exaggeration to say that her\nhouse, small as it is, contains an endowed room always at Mr. Bentley's\ndisposal.\n\n\"Mrs. Garvin is there now. She was received as a friend, as a guest--not\nas an inmate, a recipient of charity. I shall never forget how that\nwoman ran out in the sun when she saw us coming, how proud she was to be\nable to do this thing, how she ushered us into the little parlour, that\nwas all swept and polished, and how naturally and warmly she welcomed\nthe other woman, dazed and exhausted, and took her hat and veil and\nalmost carried her up the stairs. And later on I found out from Miss\nGrower, who lives here, Mrs. Bledsoe's history. Eight or nine years ago\nher husband was sent to prison for forgery, and she was left with four\nsmall children, on the verge of a fate too terrible to mention. She was\nbrought to Mr. Bentley's attention, and he started her in life.\n\n\"And now Mrs. Garvin forms another link to that chain, which goes on\ngrowing. In a month she will be earning her own living as stenographer\nfor a grain merchant whom Mr. Bentley set on his feet several years ago.\nOne thing has led to the next. And--I doubt if any neighbourhood could\nbe mentioned, north or south or west, or even in the business portion of\nthe city itself, where men and women are not to be found ready and\neager to do anything in their power for him. Of course there have been\nexceptions, what might be called failures in the ordinary terminology of\ncharity, but there are not many.\"\n\nWhen he had finished she sat quite still, musing over what he had told\nher, her eyes alight.\n\n\"Yes, it is wonderful,\" she said at length, in a low voice. \"Oh, I can\nbelieve in that, making the world a better place to live in, making\npeople happier. Of course every one cannot be like Mr. Bentley, but all\nmay do their share in their own way. If only we could get rid of this\nsenseless system of government that puts a premium on the acquisition of\nproperty! As it is, we have to depend on individual initiative. Even the\ngood Mr. Bentley does is a drop in the ocean compared to what might\nbe done if all this machinery--which has been invented, if all these\ndiscoveries of science, by which the forces of an indifferent nature\nhave been harnessed, could be turned to the service of all mankind.\nThink of how many Mrs. Garvins, of how many Dalton Streets there are in\nthe world, how many stunted children working in factories or growing up\ninto criminals in the slums! I was reading a book just the other day\non the effect of the lack of nutrition on character. We are breeding\na million degenerate citizens by starving them, to say nothing of the\neffect of disease and bad air, of the constant fear of poverty that\nhaunts the great majority of homes. There is no reason why that fear\nshould not be removed, why the latest discoveries in medicine and\nscience should not be at the disposal of all.\"\n\nThe genuineness of her passion was unmistakable. His whole being\nresponded to it.\n\n\"Have you always felt like this?\" he asked.\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Indignant--that so many people were suffering.\"\n\nHis question threw her into reflection.\n\n\"Why, no,\" she answered, at length, \"I never thought----I see what you\nmean. Four or five years ago, when I was going to socialist lectures, my\nsense of all this--inequality, injustice was intellectual. I didn't get\nindignant over it, as I do now when I think of it.\"\n\n\"And why do you get indignant now?\"\n\n\"You mean,\" she asked, \"that I have no right to be indignant, since I do\nnothing to attempt to better conditions?--\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Hodder disavowed. \"Perhaps my question is too personal,\nbut I didn't intend it to be. I was merely wondering whether any event\nor series of events had transformed a mere knowledge of these conditions\ninto feeling.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, but not in offence. Once more she relapsed into\nthought. And as he watched her, in silence, the colour that flowed and\nebbed in her cheeks registered the coming and going of memories; of\nincidents in her life hidden from him, arousing in the man the torture\nof jealousy. But his faculties, keenly alert, grasped the entire\nfield; marked once more the empirical trait in her that he loved her\nunflinching willingness to submit herself to an experiment.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" she replied at length, her thoughts naturally assuming\nspeech. \"Yes, I can see that it is so. Yet my experience has not been\nwith these conditions with which Mr. Bentley, with which you have been\nbrought in contact, but with the other side--with luxury. Oh, I am sick\nof luxury! I love it, I am not at all sure that I could do without it,\nbut I hate it, too, I rebel against it. You can't understand that.\"\n\n\"I think I can,\" he answered her.\n\n\"When I see the creatures it makes,\" she cried, \"I hate it. My\nprofession has brought me in such close contact with it that I rebelled\nat last, and came out here very suddenly, just to get away from it\nin the mass. To renew my youth, if I could. The gardens were only an\nexcuse. I had come to a point where I wanted to be quiet, to be alone,\nto think, and I knew my father would be going away. So much of my\ngirlhood was spent in that Park that I know every corner of it, and\nI--obeyed the impulse. I wanted to test it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, absorbed.\n\n\"I might have gone to the mountains or the sea, but some one would have\ncome and found me, and I should have been bound again--on the wheel.\nI shouldn't have had the strength to resist. But here--have you ever\nfelt,\" she demanded, \"that you craved a particular locality at a certain\ntime?\"\n\nHe followed her still.\n\n\"That is how I felt. These associations, that Park, the thought of my\ngirlhood, of my mother, who understood me as no one else has since,\nassumed a certain value. New York became unbearable. It is just there,\nin the very centre of our modern civilization, that one sees the\ncrudest passions. Oh, I have often wondered whether a man, however\ndisillusioned, could see New York as a woman sees it when the glamour\nis gone. We are the natural prey of the conqueror still. We dream of\nindependence--\"\n\nShe broke off abruptly.\n\nThis confession, with the sudden glimpse it gave him of the fires within\nher that would not die down, but burned now more fiercely than ever,\nsent the blood to his head. His face, his temples, were hot with the\nfierceness of his joy in his conviction that she had revealed herself\nto him. Why she had done so, he could not say... This was the woman\nwhom the world thought composed; who had triumphed over its opposition,\ncompelled it to bow before her; who presented to it that self-possessed,\nunified personality by which he had been struck at their first meeting.\nYet, paradoxically, the personality remained,--was more elusive than\nbefore. A thousand revelations, he felt, would not disclose it.\n\nHe was no nearer to solving it now.. Yet the fires burned! She, too,\nlike himself, was aflame and unsatisfied! She, too, had tasted success,\nand had revolted!\n\n\"But I don't get anywhere,\" she said wearily. \"At times I feel this\nferment, this anger that things are as they are, only to realize what\nhelpless anger it is. Why not take the world as it appears and live and\nfeel, instead of beating against the currents?\"\n\n\"But isn't that inconsistent with what you said awhile ago as to a new\ncivilization?\" Hodder asked.\n\n\"Oh, that Utopia has no reality for me. I think it has, at moments, but\nit fades. And I don't pretend to be consistent. Mr. Bentley lives in a\nworld of his own; I envy him with all my heart, I love and admire him,\nhe cheers and soothes me when I am with him. But I can't see--whatever\nhe sees. I am only aware of a remorseless universe grinding out its\ndestinies. We Anglo-Saxons are fond of deceiving ourselves about life,\nof dressing it up in beautiful colours, of making believe that it\nactually contains happiness. All our fiction reflects this--that is\nwhy I never cared to read English or American novels. The Continental\nschool, the Russians, the Frenchmen, refuse to be deluded. They are\nhonest.\"\n\n\"Realism, naturalism,\" he mused, recalling a course in philosophy,\n\"one would expect the Russian, in the conditions under which he lives,\npossessing an artistic temperament combined with a paralysis of the\ninitiative and a sense of fate, to write in that way. And the\nFrenchmen, Renan, Zola, and the others who have followed, are equally\ndeterministic, but viewing the human body as a highly organized machine\nwith which we may amuse ourselves by registering its sensations. These\nliteratures are true in so far as they reflect the characteristics\nof the nations from which they spring. That is not to say that the\nphilosophies of which they are the expressions are true. Nor is it to\nadmit that such a literature is characteristic of the spirit of America,\nand can be applied without change to our life and atmosphere. We have\nyet, I believe, to develop our own literature; which will come gradually\nas we find ourselves.\"\n\n\"Find ourselves?\" she repeated.\n\n\"Yes. Isn't that what we are trying to do? We are not determinists or\nfatalists, and to condemn us to such a philosophy would be to destroy\nus. We live on hope. In spite of our apparent materialism, we are\nidealists. And is it not possible to regard nature as governed by\nlaws--remorseless, if you like the word--and yet believe, with Kant and\nGoethe, that there is an inner realm? You yourself struggle--you cling\nto ideals.\"\n\n\"Ideals!\" she echoed. \"Ideals are useless unless one is able to see, to\nfeel something beyond this ruthless mechanism by which we are surrounded\nand hemmed in, to have some perception of another scheme. Why struggle,\nunless we struggle for something definite? Oh, I don't mean heavenly\nrewards. Nothing could be more insipid and senseless than the orthodox\nview of the hereafter. I am talking about a scheme of life here and\nnow.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" answered Hodder. \"But may there not be a meaning in this very\ndesire we have to struggle against the order of things as it appears to\nus?\"\n\n\"A meaning?\"\n\n\"A little while ago you spoke of your indignation at the inequalities\nand injustices of the world, and when I asked you if you had always felt\nthis, you replied that this feeling had grown upon you. My question is\nthis: whether that indignation would be present at all if it were not\nmeant to be turned into action.\"\n\n\"You believe that an influence is at work, an influence that impels us\nagainst our reason?\"\n\n\"I should like to think so,\" he said. \"Why should so many persons be\nexperiencing such a feeling to-day, persons who, like yourself, are the\nbeneficiaries of our present system of privilege? Why should you, who\nhave every reason to be satisfied, materially, with things as they are,\nbe troubling yourself with thoughts of others who are less-fortunate?\nAnd why should we have the spectacle, today, of men and women all over\nthis country in social work, in science and medicine and politics,\nstriving to better conditions while most of them might be much more\ncomfortable and luxurious letting well enough alone?\"\n\n\"But it's human to care,\" she objected.\n\n\"Ah--human!\" he said, and was silent. \"What do we mean by human, unless\nit is the distinguishing mark of something within us that the natural\nworld doesn't possess? Unless it is the desire and willingness to strive\nfor a larger interest than the individual interest, work and suffer\nfor others? And you spoke of making people happier. What do you mean\nby happiness? Not merely the possession of material comforts, surely.\nI grant you that those who are overworked and underfed, who are burning\nwith the consciousness of wrongs, who have no outlook ahead, are\nessentially hopeless and miserable. But by 'happiness' you, mean\nsomething more than the complacency and contentment which clothing and\nfood might bring, and the removal of the economic fear,--and even the\nrestoration of self-respect.\"\n\n\"That their lives should be fuller!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"That drudgery and despair should be replaced by interest and hope,\" he\nwent on, \"slavery by freedom. In other words, that the whole attitude\ntoward life should be changed, that life should appear a bright thing\nrather than a dark thing, that labour should be willing vicarious\ninstead of forced and personal. Otherwise, any happiness worth having is\nout of the question.\"\n\nShe was listening now with parted lips, apparently unconscious of the\nfixity of her gaze.\n\n\"You mean it is a choice between that or nothing,\" she said, in a low\nvoice. \"That there is no use in lifting people out of the treadmill--and\nremoving the terror of poverty unless you can give them something\nmore--than I have got.\"\n\n\"And something more--than I have got,\"--he was suddenly moved to\nreply...\n\nPresently, while the silence still held between them, the door opened\nand startled them into reality. Mr. Bentley came in.\n\nThe old gentleman gave no sign, as they rose to meet him, of a sense of\ntension in the atmosphere he had entered--yet each felt--somehow, that\nhe knew. The tension was released. The same thought occurred to both as\nthey beheld the peaceful welcome shining in his face, \"Here is what we\nare seeking. Why try to define it?\"\n\n\"To think that I have been gossiping with Mrs. Meyer, while you were\nwaiting for me!\" he said. \"She keeps the little florist's shop at the\ncorner of Tower Street, and she gave me these. I little guessed what\ngood use I should have for them, my dear.\"\n\nHe held out to her three fragrant, crimson roses that matched the\nresponsive colour in her cheeks as she thanked him and pinned them on\nher gown. He regarded her an instant.\n\n\"But I'm sure Mr. Hodder has entertained you,\" Mr. Bentley turned, and\nlaid his hand on the rector's shoulder.\n\n\"Most successfully,\" said Alison, cutting short his protest. And she\nsmiled at Hodder, faintly.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. AMID THE ENCIRCLING GLOOM\n\n\nI\n\nHodder, in spite of a pressing invitation to remain for supper, had left\nthem together. He turned his face westward, in the opposite direction\nfrom the parish house, still under the spell of that moment of communion\nwhich had lasted--he knew not how long, a moment of silent revelation to\nthem both. She, too, was storm-tossed! She, too, who had fared forth so\ngallantly into life, had conquered only to be beaten down--to lose her\nway.\n\nThis discovery strained the very fibres of his being. So close he had\nbeen to her--so close that each had felt, simultaneously, complete\ncomprehension of the other, comprehension that defied words, overbore\ndisagreements. He knew that she had felt it. He walked on at first in\na bewildered ecstasy, careless of aught else save that in a moment they\ntwo had reached out in the darkness and touched hands. Never had his\nexperience known such communion, never had a woman meant what this woman\nmeant, and yet he could not define that meaning. What need of religion,\nof faith in an unseen order when this existed? To have this woman in the\nmidst of chaos would be enough!\n\nFaith in an unseen order! As he walked, his mind returned to the\nargument by which he had sought to combat her doubts--and his own.\nWhence had the argument come? It was new to him--he had never formulated\nit before--that pity and longing and striving were a justification and a\nproof. Had she herself inspired, by some unknown psychological law, this\nfirst attempt of his to reform the universe, this theory which he had\nrather spoken than thought? Or had it been the knowledge of her own\nlonging, and his desire to assuage it? As twilight fell, as his spirits\nebbed, he could not apply it now--it meant nothing to him, evaded him,\nthere was in it no solace. To regain his footing once more, to climb\nagain without this woman whom he needed, and might not have! Better to\nfall, to be engulfed... The vision of her, tall and straight, with the\nroses on her breast, tortured him.\n\nThus ecstasy ebbed to despondency. He looked around him in the fading\nday, to find himself opposite the closed gates of the Botanical Gardens,\nin the southwestern portion of the city.... An hour later he had made\nhis way back to Dalton Street with its sputtering blue lights and\ngliding figures, and paused for a moment on the far sidewalk to gaze at\nMr. Bentley's gleaming windows. Should he go in? Had that personality\nsuddenly lost its power over him? How strange that now he could see\nnothing glowing, nothing inspiring within that house,--only a kindly old\nman reading a newspaper!\n\nHe walked on, slowly, to feel stealing on him that desperate longing for\nadventure which he had known so well in his younger days. And he did\nnot resist. The terror with which it had once inspired him was gone,\nor lingered only in the form of a delicious sense of uncertainty and\nanticipation. Anything might happen to him--anything would be grateful;\nthe thought of his study in the parish house was unbearable; the Dalton\nStreet which had mocked and repelled him suddenly became alluring with\nits champaigns of light and inviting stretches of darkness. In the\nblock ahead, rising out of the night like a tower blazing with a hundred\nbeacons, Hodder saw a hotel, heard the faint yet eager throbbing\nof music, beheld silhouetted figures flitting from automobiles and\ncarriages across the white glare of the pavement,--figures of men and\nwomen.\n\nHe hastened his steps, the music grew louder and louder in his ears, he\ngained the ornamental posts crowned by their incandescent globes,\nmade his way through the loiterers, descended the stone steps of the\nrestaurant, and stood staring into it as at a blurred picture. The band\ncrashed a popular two-step above the mingled voices and laughter. He sat\ndown at a vacant table near the door, and presently became aware that a\nwaiter had been for some time at his elbow.\n\n\"What will you have, sir?\"\n\nThen he remembered that he had not eaten, discovered that he was hungry,\nand ordered some sandwiches and beer. Still staring, the figures began\nto differentiate themselves, although they all appeared, somehow, in\nperpetual motion; hurrying, though seated. It was like gazing at a\nquivering cinematograph. Here and there ribbons of smoke curled upward,\nadding volume to the blue cloud that hung over the tables, which in turn\nwas dissipated in spots by the industrious electric fans. Everywhere\nhe looked he met the glances of women; even at the table next him, they\nwere not so absorbed in their escorts as to be able to resist flinging\nhim covert stares between the shrieks of laughter in which they\nintermittently indulged. The cumulative effect of all these faces was\nintoxicating, and for a long time he was unable to examine closely any\none group. What he saw was a composite woman with flushed cheeks\nand soliciting eyes, becomingly gowned and hatted--to the masculine\njudgment. On the walls, heavily frescoed in the German style, he read,\nin Gothic letters:\n\n          \"Wer liebt nicht Wein, Weib, and Gesang,\n          Er bleibt ein Narr sein Leben lang.\"\n\nThe waiter brought the sandwiches and beer, yet he did not eat. In the\nmiddle distance certain figures began insistently to stand out,--figures\nof women sitting alone wherever he looked he met a provoking gaze. One\nwoman, a little farther away than the rest, seemed determinedly bent\non getting a nod of recognition, and it was gradually borne in upon\nHodder's consciousness that her features were familiar. In avoiding her\neyes he studied the men at the next table,--or rather one of them, who\nloudly ordered the waiters about, who told brief anecdotes that were\nuproariously applauded; whose pudgy, bejewelled fingers were continually\nfeeling for the bottle in the ice beside his chair, or nudging his\ncompanions with easy familiarity; whose little eyes, set in a heavy\nface, lighted now and again with a certain expression.....\n\nSuddenly Hodder pushed back his chair and got to his feet, overcome by a\nchoking sensation like that of being, asphyxiated by foul gases. He\nmust get out at once, or faint. What he had seen in the man's eyes had\naroused in him sheer terror, for it was the image of something in\nhis own soul which had summarily gained supremacy and led him hither,\nunresisting, to its own abiding-place. In vain he groped to reconstruct\nthe process by which that other spirit--which he would fain have\nbelieved his true spirit--had been drugged and deadened in its very\nflight.\n\nHe was aware, as he still stood uncertainly beside the table, of the\nwhite-aproned waiter looking at him, and of some one else!--the woman\nwhose eyes had been fastened on him so persistently. She was close\nbeside him, speaking to him.\n\n\"Seems to me we've met before.\"\n\nHe looked at her, at first uncomprehendingly, then with a\ndawning realization of her identity. Even her name came to him,\nunexpectedly,--Kate Marcy,--the woman in the flat!\n\n\"Ain't you going to invite me to have some supper?\" she whispered\neagerly, furtively, as one accustomed to be rebuffed, yet bold in spite\nof it. \"They'll throw me out if they think I'm accosting you.\"\n\nHow was it that, a moment ago, she had appeared to him mysterious,\ninviting? At this range he could only see the paint on her cheeks,\nthe shadows under her burning eyes, the shabby finery of her gown. Her\nwonderful bronze hair only made the contrast more pitiful. He acted\nautomatically, drawing out for her the chair opposite his own, and sat\ndown again.\n\n\"Say, but I'm hungry!\" she exclaimed, pulling off her gloves. She smiled\nat him, wanly, yet with a brazen coquettishness become habit.\n\n\"Hungry!\" he repeated idly.\n\n\"I guess you'd be, if you'd only had a fried egg and a cup of coffee\nto-day, and nothing last night.\"\n\nHe pushed over to her, hastily, with a kind of horror, the plate of\nsandwiches. She began eating them ravenously; but presently paused, and\nthrust them back toward him. He shook his head.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he replied.\n\n\"You ordered them, didn't you? Ain't you eating anything?\"\n\n\"I'm not hungry,\" he said.\n\nShe continued eating awhile without comment. And he watched her as one\nfascinated, oblivious to his surroundings, in a turmoil of thought and\nemotion.\n\n\"I'm dry,\" she announced meaningly.\n\nHe hesitated a moment, and then gave her the bottle of beer. She made a\nwry face as she poured it out.\n\n\"Have they run out of champagne?\" she inquired.\n\nThis time he did not hesitate. The women of his acquaintance, at the\ndinner parties he attended, drank champagne. Why should he refuse it to\nthis woman? A long-nosed, mediaeval-looking waiter was hovering about,\none of those bizarre, battered creatures who have long exhausted the\nsurprises of life, presiding over this amazing situation with all the\nsang froid of a family butler. Hodder told him to bring champagne.\n\n\"What kind, sir?\" he asked, holding out a card.\n\n\"The best you have.\"\n\nThe woman stared at him in wonder.\n\n\"You're what an English Johnny I know would call a little bit of all\nright!\" she declared with enthusiastic approval.\n\n\"Since you are hungry,\" he went on, \"suppose you have something more\nsubstantial than sandwiches. What would you like?\"\n\nShe did not answer at once. Amazement grew in her eyes, amazement and a\nkind of fear.\n\n\"Quit joshing!\" she implored him, and he found it difficult to cope with\nher style of conversation. For a while she gazed helplessly at the bill\nof fare.\n\n\"I guess you'll think it's funny,\" she said hesitatingly, \"but I feel\njust like a good beefsteak and potatoes. Bring a thick one, Walter.\"\n\nThe waiter sauntered off.\n\n\"Why should I think it strange?\" Hodder asked.\n\n\"Well, if you knew how many evenings I've sat up there in my room and\nthought what I'd order if I ever again got hold of some rich guy who'd\nloosen up. There ain't any use trying to put up a bluff with you.\nNothing was too good for me once, caviar, pate de foie gras\" (her\npronunciation is not to be imitated), \"chicken casserole, peach Melba,\nfilet of beef with mushrooms,--I've had 'em all, and I used to sit up\nand say I'd hand out an order like that. You never do what you think\nyou're going to do in this life.\"\n\nThe truth of this remark struck him with a force she did not suspect;\nstung him, as it were, into a sense of reality.\n\n\"And now,\" she added pathetically, \"all t want is a beefsteak! Don't\nthat beat you?\"\n\nShe appeared so genuinely surprised at this somewhat contemptible trick\nfate had played her that Hodder smiled in spite of himself.\n\n\"I didn't recognize you at first in that get-up,\" she observed, looking\nat his blue serge suit. \"So you've dropped the preacher business, have\nyou? You're wise, all right.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" he asked.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you when you came 'round that time that you weren't like\nthe rest of 'em? You're too human.\"\n\nOnce more the word, and on her lips, startled him.\n\n\"Some of the best men I have ever known, the broadest and most\nunderstanding men, have been clergymen,\" he found himself protesting.\n\n\"Well, they haven't dropped in on me. The only one I ever saw that\nmeasured up to something like that was you, and now you've chucked it.\"\n\nHad he, as she expressed the matter, \"chucked it\"? Her remark brought\nhim reluctantly, fearfully, remorselessly--agitated and unprepared as he\nwas--face to face with his future.\n\n\"You were too good for the job,\" she declared. \"What is there in it?\nThere ain't nobody converted these days that I can see, and what's the\nuse of gettin' up and preach into a lot of sapheads that don't know what\nreligion is? Sure they don't.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" he asked.\n\n\"You've called my bluff.\" She laughed. \"Say, do YOU? If there was\nanything in it you'd have kept on preachin' to that bunch and made some\nof 'em believe they was headed for hell; you'd have made one of 'em\nthat owns the flat house I live in, who gets fancy rents out of us poor\ngirls, give it up. That's a nice kind of business for a church member,\nain't it?\"\n\n\"Owns the house in which you live!\"\n\n\"Sure.\" She smiled at him compassionately, pitying his innocence and\nignorance. \"Now I come to think of it, I guess he don't go to your\nchurch,--it's the big Baptist church on the boulevard. But what's the\ndifference?\"\n\n\"None,\" said Hodder, despondently.\n\nShe regarded him curiously.\n\n\"You remember when you dropped in that night, when the kid was sick?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Well, now you ain't in the business any more, I may as well tell you\nyou kind of got in on me. I was sorry for you--honest, I was. I couldn't\nbelieve at first you was on the level, but it didn't take me long to see\nthat they had gold-bricked you, too. I saw you weren't wise to what they\nwere.\"\n\n\"You thought--\" he began and paused dumfounded.\n\n\"Why not?\" she retorted. \"It looked easy to me,--your line. How was I to\nknow at first that they had you fooled? How was I to know you wasn't in\nthe game?\"\n\n\"The game?\"\n\n\"Say, what else is it but a game? You must be on now, ain't you? Why. do\nthey put up to keep the churches going? There ain't any coupons coming\nout of 'em.\n\n\"Maybe some of these millionaires think they can play all the horses and\nwin,--get into heaven and sell gold bricks on the side. But I guess most\nof 'em don't think about heaven. They just use the church for a front,\nand take in strangers in the back alley,--downtown.\"\n\nHodder was silent, overwhelmed by the brutal aptness of her figures. Nor\ndid he take the trouble of a defence, of pointing out that hers was not\nthe whole truth. What really mattered--he saw--was what she and those\nlike her thought. Such minds were not to be disabused by argument; and\nindeed he had little inclination for it then.\n\n\"There's nothing in it.\"\n\nBy this expression he gathered she meant life. And some hidden impulse\nbade him smile at her.\n\n\"There is this,\" he answered.\n\nShe opened her mouth, closed it and stared at him, struck by his\nexpression, striving uneasily to fathom hidden depths in his remark.\n\n\"I don't get on to you,\" she said lamely. \"I didn't that other time. I\nnever ran across anybody like you.\"\n\nHe tried to smile again.\n\n\"You mustn't mind me,\" he answered.\n\nThey fell into an oasis of silence, surrounded by mad music and\nlaughter. Then came the long-nosed waiter carrying the beefsteak aloft,\nfollowed by a lad with a bucket of ice, from which protruded the green\nand gold neck of a bottle. The plates were put down, the beefsteak\ncarved, the champagne opened and poured out with a flourish. The woman\nraised her glass.\n\n\"Here's how!\" she said, with an attempt at gayety. And she drank to him.\n\"It's funny how I ran across you again, ain't it?\" She threw back her\nhead and laughed.\n\nHe raised his glass, tasted the wine, and put it down again. A sheet of\nfire swept through him.\n\n\"What's the matter with it? Is it corked?\" she demanded. \"It goes to the\nright spot with me.\"\n\n\"It seems very good,\" he said, trying to smile, and turning to the food\non his plate. The very idea of eating revolted him--and yet he made\nthe attempt: he had a feeling, ill defined, that consequences of vital\nimportance depended upon this attempt, on his natural acceptance of the\nsituation. And, while he strove to reduce the contents of his plate, he\nracked his brain for some subject of conversation. The flamboyant walls\nof the room pressed in on every side; comment of that which lay within\ntheir limits was impossible,--but he could not, somehow, get beyond\nthem. Was there in the whole range of life one easy topic which they\nmight share in common? Yet a bond existed between this woman and\nhimself--a bond of which he now became aware, and which seemed strangely\nto grow stronger as the minutes passed and no words were spoken. Why\nwas it that she, too, to whom speech came so easily, had fallen dumb?\nHe began to long for some remark, however disconcerting. The tension\nincreased.\n\nShe put down her knife and fork. Tears sprang into her eyes,--tears of\nanger, he thought.\n\n\"Say, it's no use trying to put up a bluff with me,\" she cried.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" he asked.\n\n\"You know what I mean, all right. What did you come in here for,\nanyway?\"\n\n\"I don't know--I couldn't tell you,\" he answered.\n\nThe very honesty of his words seemed, for an instant, to disconcert her;\nand she produced a torn lace handkerchief, which she thrust in her eyes.\n\n\"Why can't you leave me alone?\" she demanded. \"I'm all right.\"\n\nIf he did not at once reply, it was because of some inner change which\nhad taken place in himself; and he seemed to see things, suddenly,\nin their true proportions. He no longer feared a scene and its\nconsequences. By virtue of something he had cast off or taken on, he was\naware of a newly acquired mastery of the situation, and by a hidden and\nunconscious process he had managed to get at the real woman behind the\npaint: had beaten down, as it were without a siege, her defences. And he\nwas incomparably awed by the sight of her quivering, frightened self.\n\nHer weeping grew more violent. He saw the people at the next table\nturn and stare, heard the men laughing harshly. For the spectacle was\nevidently not an uncommon one here. She pushed away her unfinished\nglass, gathered up her velvet bag and rose abruptly.\n\n\"I guess I ain't hungry after all,\" she said, and started toward the\ndoor. He turned to the waiter, who regarded him unmoved, and asked for a\ncheck.\n\n\"I'll get it,\" he said.\n\nHodder drew out a ten dollar bill, and told him to keep the change. The\nwaiter looked at him. Some impulse moved him to remark, as he picked up\nthe rector's hat:\n\n\"Don't let her put it over you, sir.\"\n\nHodder scarcely heard him. He hurried up the steps and gained the\npavement, and somewhere in the black shadows beyond the arc-lights\nhe saw her disappearing down the street. Careless of all comment he\nhastened on, overtook her, and they walked rapidly side by side. Now and\nagain he heard a sob, but she said nothing. Thus they came to the house\nwhere the Garvins had lived, and passed it, and stopped in front of the\ndimly lighted vestibule of the flats next door. In drawing the key from\nher bag she dropped it: he picked it up and put it in the lock himself.\nShe led the way without comment up the darkened stairs, and on the\nlanding produced another key, opened the door of her rooms, fumbled for\nthe electric button, and suddenly the place was flooded with light. He\nglanced in, and recoiled.\n\n\n\nII\n\nOddly enough, the first thing he noticed in the confusion that reigned\nwas the absence of the piano. Two chairs were overturned, and one of\nthem was broken; a siphon of vichy lay on the floor beside a crushed\nglass and two or three of the cheap ornaments that had been swept off\nthe mantel and broken on the gaudy tiles of the hearth. He glanced at\nthe woman, who had ceased crying, and stood surveying the wreckage with\nthe calmness, the philosophic nonchalance of a class that comes to look\nupon misfortune as inevitable.\n\n\"They didn't do a thing to this place, did they?\" was her comment.\n\"There was two guys in here to-night who got a notion they were funny.\"\n\nHodder had thought to have fathomed all the horrors of her existence,\nbut it was not until he looked into this room that the bottomless\ndepths of it were brought home to him. Could it be possible that the\ncivilization in which he lived left any human being so defenceless as to\nbe at the mercy of the ghouls who had been here? The very stale odours\nof the spilled whiskey seemed the material expression of the essence\nof degraded souls; for a moment it overpowered him. Then came the\nimperative need of action, and he began to right one of the chairs. She\ndarted forward.\n\n\"Cut it out!\" she cried. \"What business have you got coming in here and\nstraightening up? I was a fool to bring you, anyway.\"\n\nIt was in her eyes that he read her meaning, and yet could not credit\nit. He was abashed--ashamed; nay, he could not define the feeling in\nhis breast. He knew that what he read was the true interpretation of\nher speech, for in some manner--he guessed not how--she had begun to\nidealize him, to feel that the touch of these things defiled him.\n\n\"I believe I invited myself,\" he answered, with attempted cheerfulness.\nThen it struck him, in his predicament, that this was precisely what\nothers had done!\n\n\"When you asked me a little while ago whether I had left the Church, I\nlet you think I had. I am still connected with St. John's, but I do not\nknow how long I shall continue to be.\"\n\nShe was on her knees with dustpan and whiskbroom, cleaning up the\nfragments of glass on the stained carpet. And she glanced up at him\nswiftly, diviningly.\n\n\"Say--you're in trouble yourself, ain't you?\"\n\nShe got up impulsively, spilling some of the contents of the pan. A\nsubtle change had come in her, and under the gallantly drooping feathers\nof her hat he caught her eye--the human eye that so marvellously\nreflects the phases of the human soul: the eye which so short a time\nbefore hardily and brazenly had flashed forth its invitation, now\nactually shone with fellowship and sympathy. And for a moment this look\nwas more startling, more appalling than the other; he shrank from it,\nresented it even more. Was it true that they had something in common?\nAnd if so, was it sin or sorrow, or both?\n\n\"I might have known,\" she said, staring at him. In spite of his gesture\nof dissent, he saw that she was going over the events of the evening\nfrom her new point of view.\n\n\"I might have known, when we were sitting there in Harrods, that you\nwere up against it, too, but I couldn't think of anything but the way I\nwas fixed. The agent's been here twice this week for the rent, and I was\nkind of desperate for a square meal.\"\n\nHodder took the dustpan from her hand, and flung its contents into the\nfireplace.\n\n\"Then we are both fortunate,\" he said, \"to have met each other.\"\n\n\"I don't see where you come in,\" she told him.\n\nHe turned and smiled at her.\n\n\"Do you remember when I was here that evening about two months ago I\nsaid I should like to be your friend? Well, I meant it. And I have often\nhoped, since then, that some circumstance might bring us together again.\nYou seemed to think that no friendship was possible between us, but I\nhave tried to make myself believe that you said so because you didn't\nknow me.\"\n\n\"Honest to God?\" she asked. \"Is that on the level?\"\n\n\"I only ask for an opportunity to prove it,\" he replied, striving to\nspeak naturally. He stooped and laid the dustpan on the hearth. \"There!\nNow let's sit down.\"\n\nShe sank on the sofa, her breast rising and falling, her gaze dumbly\nfixed on him, as one under hypnosis. He took the rocker.\n\n\"I have wanted to tell you how grateful Mrs. Garvin, the boy's\nmother--was for the roses you brought. She doesn't know who sent them,\nbut I intend to tell her, and she will thank you herself. She is living\nout in the country. And the boy--you would scarcely recognize him.\"\n\n\"I couldn't play the piano for a week after--that thing happened.\" She\nglanced at the space where the instrument had stood.\n\n\"You taught yourself to play?\" he asked.\n\n\"I had music lessons.\"\n\n\"Music lessons?\"\n\n\"Not here--before I left home--up the State, in a little country\ntown,--Madison. It seems like a long time ago, but it's only seven years\nin September. Mother and father wanted all of us children to know a\nlittle more than they did, and I guess they pinched a good deal to give\nus a chance. I went a year to the high school, and then I was all for\ncoming to the city--I couldn't stand Madison, there wasn't anything\ngoing on. Mother was against it,--said I was too good-looking to leave\nhome. I wish I never had. You wouldn't believe I was good-looking once,\nwould you?\"\n\nShe spoke dispassionately, not seeming to expect assent, but Hodder\nglanced involuntarily at her wonderful crown of hair. She had taken off\nher hat. He was thinking of the typical crime of American parents,--and\nsuddenly it struck him that her speech had changed, that she had dropped\nthe suggestive slang of the surroundings in which she now lived.\n\n\"I was a fool to come, but I couldn't see it then. All I could think of\nwas to get away to a place where something was happening. I wanted to\nget into Ferguson's--everybody in Madison knew about Ferguson's, what a\ngrand store it was,--but I couldn't. And after a while I got a place at\nthe embroidery counter at Pratt's. That's a department store, too, you\nknow. It looked fine, but it wasn't long before I fell wise to a few\nthings.\" (She relapsed into slang occasionally.) \"Have you ever tried\nto stand on your feet for nine hours, where you couldn't sit down for\na minute? Say, when Florry Kinsley and me--she was the girl I roomed\nwith--would get home at night, often we'd just lie down and laugh\nand cry, we were so tired, and our feet hurt so. We were too used up\nsometimes to get up and cook supper on the little stove we had. And\nsitting around a back bedroom all evening was worse than Madison. We'd\ngo out, tired as we were, and walk the streets.\"\n\nHe nodded, impressed by the fact that she did not seem to be appealing\nto his sympathy. Nor, indeed, did she appear--in thus picking up the\nthreads of her past--to be consciously accounting for her present. She\nrecognized no causation there.\n\n\"Say, did you ever get to a place where you just had to have something\nhappen? When you couldn't stand bein' lonely night after night, when you\nwent out on the streets and saw everybody on the way to a good time but\nyou? We used to look in the newspapers for notices of the big balls,\nand we'd take the cars to the West End and stand outside the awnings\nwatching the carriages driving up and the people coming in. And the same\nwith the weddings. We got to know a good many of the swells by sight.\nThere was Mrs. Larrabbee,\"--a certain awe crept into her voice--\"and\nMiss Ferguson--she's sweet--and a lot more. Some of the girls used to\ncopy their clothes and hats, but Florry and me tried to live honest. It\nwas funny,\" she added irrelevantly, \"but the more worn out we were at\nnight, the more we'd want a little excitement, and we used to go to the\ndance-halls and keep going until we were ready to drop.\"\n\nShe laughed at the recollection.\n\n\"There was a floorwalker who never let me alone the whole time I was at\nPratt's--he put me in mind of a pallbearer. His name was Selkirk, and\nhe had a family in Westerly, out on the Grade Suburban.... Some of the\ngirls never came back at all, except to swagger in and buy expensive\nthings, and tell us we were fools to work. And after a while I noticed\nFlorry was getting discouraged. We never had so much as a nickel left\nover on Saturdays and they made us sign a paper, when they hired us,\nthat we lived at home. It was their excuse for paying us six dollars\na week. They do it at Ferguson's, too. They say they can get plenty of\ngirls who do live at home. I made up my mind I'd go back to Madison, but\nI kept putting it off, and then father died, and I couldn't!\n\n\"And then, one day, Florry left. She took her things from the room when\nI was at the store, and I never saw her again. I got another roommate.\nI couldn't afford to pay for the room alone. You wouldn't believe I kept\nstraight, would you?\" she demanded, with a touch of her former defiance.\n\"I had plenty of chances better than that floorwalker. But I knew I was\ngood looking, and I thought if I could only hold out I might get married\nto some fellow who was well fixed. What's the matter?\"\n\nHodder's exclamation had been involuntary, for in these last words she\nhad unconsciously brought home to him the relentless predicament in\nthe lives of these women. She had been saving herself--for what? A more\nadvantageous, sale!\n\n\"It's always been my luck,\" she went on reflectingly, \"that when what I\nwanted to happen did happen, I never could take advantage of it. It was\njust like that to-night, when you handed me out the bill of fare, and\nI ordered beefsteak. And it was like that when--when he came along--I\ndidn't do what I thought I was going to do. It's terrible to fall in\nlove, isn't it? I mean the real thing. I've read in books that it only\ncomes once, and I guess it's so.\"\n\nFortunately she seemed to expect no answer to this query. She was\nstaring at the wall with unseeing eyes.\n\n\"I never thought of marrying him, from the first. He could have done\nanything with me--he was so good and generous--and it was him I was\nthinking about. That's love, isn't it? Maybe you don't believe a woman\nlike me knows what love is. You've got a notion that goin' downhill,\nas I've been doing, kills it, haven't you? I Wish to God it did--but\nit don't: the ache's there, and sometimes it comes in the daytime, and\nsometimes at night, and I think I'll go crazy. When a woman like me is\nin love there isn't anything more terrible on earth, I tell you. If a\ngirl's respectable and good it's bad enough, God knows, if she can't\nhave the man she wants; but when she's like me--it's hell. That's the\nonly way I can describe it. She feels there is nothing about her that's\nclean, that he wouldn't despise. There's many a night I wished I could\nhave done what Garvin did, but I didn't have the nerve.\"\n\n\"Don't say that!\" he commanded sharply.\n\n\"Why not? It's the best way out.\"\n\n\"I can see how one might believe it to be,\" he answered. Indeed,\nit seemed that his vision had been infinitely extended, that he had\nsuddenly come into possession of the solution of all the bewildered,\ndespairing gropings of the human soul. Only awhile ago, for instance,\nthe mood of self-destruction had been beyond his imagination: tonight\nhe understood it, though he still looked upon it with horror. And he saw\nthat his understanding of her--or of any human being--could never be of\nthe intellect. He had entered into one of those astounding yet simple\nrelationships wherein truth, and truth alone, is possible. He knew that\nsuch women lied, deceived themselves; he could well conceive that\nthe image of this first lover might have become idealized in her\nvicissitudes; that the memories of the creature-comforts, of first\npassion, might have enhanced as the victim sank. It was not only because\nshe did not attempt to palliate that he believed her.\n\n\"I remember the time I met him,--it was only four years ago last spring,\nbut it seems like a lifetime. It was Decoration Day, and it was so\nbeautiful I went out with another girl to the Park, and we sat on the\ngrass and looked at the sky and wished we lived in the country. He was\nin an automobile; I never did know exactly how it happened,--we looked\nat each other, and he slowed up and came back and asked us to take a\nride. I had never been in one of those things--but that wasn't why I\nwent, I guess. Well, the rest was easy. He lost his head, and I was just\nas bad. You wouldn't believe me if I told you how rich he was: it scared\nme when I found out about him, and he was so handsome and full of fun\nand spirits, and generous! I never knew anybody like him. Honest, I\nnever expected he'd want to marry me. He didn't at first,--it was only\nafter a while. I never asked him to, and when he began to talk about it\nI told him it would cut him off from his swell friends, and I knew his\nfather might turn him loose. Oh, it wasn't the money! Well, he'd get mad\nall through, and say he never got along with the old man, and that his\nfriends would have to take me, and he couldn't live without me. He said\nhe would have me educated, and bought me books, and I tried to read\nthem. I'd have done anything for him. He'd knocked around a good deal\nsince he'd been to Harvard College,--he wasn't what you'd call a saint,\nbut his heart was all right. And he changed, too, I could see it. He\nsaid he was going to make something out of himself.\n\n\"I didn't think it was possible to be so happy, but I had a feeling all\nalong, inside of me, that it couldn't come off. I had a little flat in\nRutger Street, over on the south side, and everything in the world I\nwanted. Well, one day, sure enough, the bell rang and I opened the door,\nand there stood a man with side whiskers staring at me, and staring\nuntil I was frightened to death. I never saw such eyes as he had. And\nall of a sudden I knew it was his father.\n\n\"'Is this Miss Marcy?'\" he said.\n\n\"I couldn't say anything at all, but he handed me his card and smiled,\nI'll never forget how he smiled--and came right in and sat down. I'd\nheard of that man all my life, and how much money he'd made, and all\nthat. Why, up in Madison folks used to talk about him--\" she checked\nherself suddenly and stared at Hodder in consternation. \"Maybe you know\nhim!\" she exclaimed. \"I never thought!\"\n\n\"Maybe I do,\" he assented wearily. In the past few moments suspicion had\nbecome conviction.\n\n\"Well--what difference does it make--now? It's all over, and I'm not\ngoing to bother him. I made up my mind I wouldn't, on account of him,\nyou understand. I never fell that low--thank God!\"\n\nHodder nodded. He could not speak.... The woman seemed to be living over\nagain that scene, in her imagination.\n\n\"I just couldn't realize who it was sitting there beside me, but if I\nhadn't known it wouldn't have made any difference. He could have done\nanything with me, anyway, and he knew how to get at me. He said, now\nthat he'd seen me, that he was sure I was a good girl at the bottom and\nloved his son, and that I wouldn't want to ruin the boy when he had such\na big future ahead of him. I wouldn't have thought, to look at the man,\nthat he could have been so gentle. I made a fool of myself and cried,\nand told him I'd go away and never see his son any more--that I'd always\nbeen against marrying him. Well, he almost had tears in his eyes when he\nthanked me and said I'd never regret it, and he pulled an envelope out\nof his pocket. I said I wouldn't take any money, and gave it back\nto him. I've always been sorry since that I didn't make him take it\nback--it never did anything but harm to me. But he had his way. He laid\nit on the table and said he wouldn't feel right, and took my hand--and I\njust didn't care.\n\n\"Well, what do you think I did after he'd gone? I went and played a\npiece on the piano,--and I never can bear to hear that ragtime to this\nday. I couldn't seem to feel anything. And after a while I got up\nand opened the envelope--it was full of crackly new hundred dollar\nbills--thirty of 'em, and as I sat there staring at 'em the pain came\non, like a toothache, in throbs, getting worse all the time until I just\ncouldn't stand it. I had a notion of sending the money back even then,\nbut I didn't. I didn't know how to do it,--and as I told you, I wasn't\nable to care much. Then I remembered I'd promised to go away, and I had\nto have some money for that, and if I didn't leave right off I wouldn't\nhave the strength to do it. I hadn't even thought where to go: I\ncouldn't think, so I got dressed and went down to the depot anyway. It\nwas one of those bright, bitter cold winter days after a thaw when the\nicicles are hanging everywhere. I went inside and walked up and down\nthat long platform under the glass roof. My, it was cold in there! I\nlooked over all the signs, and made up my mind I'd go to Chicago.\n\n\"I meant to work, I never meant to spend the money, but to send it back.\nI'd put it aside--and then I'd go and take a little. Say, it was easy\nnot to work--and I didn't care what happened to me as long as I wasn't\ngoing to see him again. Well, I'm not trying to smooth it over, I\nsuppose there was something crooked about me from the start, but I just\nwent clean to hell with that money, and when I heard he'd gone away, I\ncame back here.\"\n\n\"Something crooked!\" The words rang in Hodder's ears, in his very soul.\nHow was he or any man to estimate, to unravel the justice from the\ninjustice, to pass upon the merit of this woman's punishment? Here\nagain, in this vitiated life, was only to be seen the remorseless\nworking of law--cause and effect. Crooked! Had not the tree been crooked\nfrom the beginning--incapable of being straightened? She had herself\nnaively confessed it. Was not the twist ingrained? And if so, where was\nthe salvation he had preached? There was good in her still,--but what\nwas \"good\"?... He took no account of his profound compassion.\n\nWhat comfort could he give her, what hope could he hold out that the\ntwist, now gnarled and knotted, might be removed, that she might gain\npeace of soul and body and the \"happiness\" of which he had talked with\nAlison Parr?... He raised his eyes, to discover that the woman's were\nfixed upon him, questioningly.\n\n\"I suppose I was a fool to tell you,\" she said, with a shade of her\nold bitterness; \"it can't do any good.\" Her next remark was startlingly\nastute. \"You've found out for yourself, I guess, that all this talk\nabout heaven and hell and repentance don't amount to anything. Hell\ncouldn't be any worse than I've been through, no matter how hot it is.\nAnd heaven!\" She laughed, burst into tears, and quickly dried them.\n\"You know the man I've been talking about, that bought me off. I didn't\nintend to tell you, but I see you can't help knowing--Eldon Parr. I\ndon't say he didn't do right from his way of looking at things,--but\nsay, it wasn't exactly Christian, was it?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"it wasn't.\" He bowed his head, and presently, when\nhe raised it again, he caught something in her look that puzzled and\ndisturbed him--an element of adoration.\n\n\"You're white through and through,\" she said, slowly and distinctly.\n\nAnd he knew not how to protest.\n\n\"I'll tell you something,\" she went on, as one who has made a discovery.\n\"I liked you the first time you came in here--that night--when you\nwanted me to be friends; well, there was something that seemed to make\nit impossible then. I felt it, if you didn't.\" She groped for words. \"I\ncan't explain what it was, but now it's gone. You're different. I think\na lot more of you. Maybe it's because of what you did at Harrod's,\nsitting down with me and giving me supper when I was so hungry, and the\nchampagne. You weren't ashamed of me.\"\n\n\"Good God, why should I have been!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"You! Why shouldn't you?\" she cried fiercely.\n\n\"There's hardly a man in that place that wouldn't have been. They all\nknow me by sight--and some of 'em better. You didn't see 'em grinning\nwhen I came up to you, but I did. My God--it's awful--it's awful I....\"\nShe burst into violent weeping, long deferred.\n\nHe took her hand in his, and did not speak, waiting for the fit to spend\nitself.... And after a while the convulsive shudders that shook her\ngradually ceased.\n\n\"You must trust me,\" he said. \"The first thing tomorrow I'm going to\nmake arrangements for you to get out of these rooms. You can't stay here\nany longer.\"\n\n\"That's sure,\" she answered, trying to smile. \"I'm broke. I even owe the\nco--the policeman.\"\n\n\"The policeman!\"\n\n\"He has to turn it in to Tom Beatty and the politicians\"\n\nBeatty! Where had he heard the name? Suddenly it came to him that Beatty\nwas the city boss, who had been eulogized by Mr. Plimpton!\n\n\"I have some good friends who will be glad to help you to get work--and\nuntil you do get work. You will have to fight--but we all have to fight.\nWill you try?\"\n\n\"Sure, I'll try,\" she answered, in a low voice.\n\nHer very tone of submission troubled him. And he had a feeling that, if\nhe had demanded, she would have acquiesced in anything.\n\n\"We'll talk it over to-morrow,\" he went on, clinging to his note of\noptimism. \"We'll find out what you can do easiest, to begin with.\"\n\n\"I might give music lessons,\" she suggested.\n\nThe remark increased his uneasiness, for he recognized in it a sure\nsymptom of disease--a relapse into what might almost have been called\nlevity, blindness to the supreme tragedy of her life which but a moment\nbefore had shaken and appalled her. He shook his head bravely.\n\n\"I'm afraid that wouldn't do--at first.\"\n\nShe rose and went into the other room, returning in a few moments with\na work basket, from which she drew a soiled and unfinished piece of\nembroidery.\n\n\"There's a bureau cover I started when I was at Pratt's,\" she said, as\nshe straightened it over her knees. \"It's a copy of an expensive one. I\nnever had the patience to finish it, but one of the sales-ladies there,\nwho was an expert, told me it was pretty good: She taught me the stitch,\nand I had a notion at that time I might make a little money for dresses\nand the theatre. I was always clever with my hands.\"\n\n\"The very thing!\" he said, with hopeful emphasis. \"I'm sure I can get\nyou plenty of it to do. And I'll come back in the morning.\"\n\nHe gave it back to her, and as she was folding it his glance fell on a\nphotograph in the basket.\n\n\"I kept it, I don't know why,\" he heard her say; \"I didn't have the\nheart to burn it.\"\n\nHe started recovered himself, and rose.\n\n\"I'll go to see the agent the first thing to-morrow,\" he said. \"And\nthen--you'll be ready for me? You trust me?\"\n\n\"I'd do anything for you,\" was her tremulous reply.\n\nHer disquieting, submissive smile haunted him as he roped his way down\nthe stairs to the street, and then the face in the photograph replaced\nit--the laughing eyes, the wilful, pleasure--loving mouth he had seen in\nthe school and college pictures of Preston Parr.\n\n\n\n\nVolume 5.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. RECONSTRUCTION\n\n\nI\n\nLife had indeed become complicated, paradoxical. He, John Hodder, a\nclergyman, rector of St. John's by virtue of not having resigned,\nhad entered a restaurant of ill repute, had ordered champagne for an\nabandoned woman, and had no sense of sin when he awoke the next morning!\nThe devil, in the language of orthodox theology, had led him there. He\nhad fallen under the influence of the tempter of his youth, and all in\nhim save the carnal had been blotted out.\n\nMore paradoxes! If the devil had not taken possession of him and led him\nthere, it were more than probable that he could never have succeeded\nin any other way in getting on a footing of friendship with this woman,\nKate Marcy. Her future, to be sure, was problematical. Here was no\nsimple, sentimental case he might formerly have imagined, of trusting\ninnocence betrayed, but a mixture of good and evil, selfishness and\nunselfishness. And she had, in spite of all, known the love which\neffaces self! Could the disintegration, in her case, be arrested?\n\nGradually Hodder was filled with a feeling which may be called amazement\nbecause, although his brain was no nearer to a solution than before, he\nwas not despondent. For a month he had not permitted his mind to dwell\non the riddle; yet this morning he felt stirring within him a new energy\nfor which he could not account, a hope unconnected with any mental\nprocess! He felt in touch, once more, faintly but perceptibly, with\nsomething stable in the chaos. In bygone years he had not seen the\nchaos, but the illusion of an orderly world, a continual succession of\nsunrises, 'couleur de rose', from the heights above Bremerton. Now were\nthe scales fallen from his eyes; now he saw the evil, the injustice,\nthe despair; felt, in truth, the weight of the sorrow of it all, and yet\nthat sorrow was unaccountably transmuted, as by a chemical process, into\nsomething which for the first time had a meaning--he could not say what\nmeaning. The sting of despair had somehow been taken out of it, and it\nremained poignant!\n\nNot on the obsession of the night before, when he had walked down Dalton\nStreet and beheld it transformed into a realm of adventure, but upon his\npast life did he look back now with horror, upon the even tenor of those\ndays and years in the bright places. His had been the highroad of a\nfancied security, from which he had feared to stray, to seek his God\nacross the rough face of nature, from black, forgotten capons to the\nflying peaks in space. He had feared reality. He had insisted upon\ngazing at the universe through the coloured glasses of an outworn\ntheology, instead of using his own eyes.\n\nSo he had left the highroad, the beaten way of salvation many others had\ndeserted, had flung off his spectacles, had plunged into reality, to be\nscratched and battered, to lose his way. Not until now had something of\ngrim zest come to him, of an instinct which was the first groping of a\nvision, as to where his own path might lie. Through what thickets and\nover what mountains he knew not as yet--nor cared to know. He felt\nresistance, whereas on the highroad he had felt none. On the highroad\nhis cry had gone unheeded and unheard, yet by holding out his hand in\nthe wilderness he had helped another, bruised and bleeding, to her feet!\nSalvation, Let it be what it might be, he would go on, stumbling and\nseeking, through reality.\n\nEven this last revelation, of Eldon Parr's agency in another tragedy,\nseemed to have no further power to affect him... Nor could Hodder think\nof Alison as in blood-relationship to the financier, or even to the boy,\nwhose open, pleasure-loving face he had seen in the photograph.\n\n\n\nII\n\nA presage of autumn was in the air, and a fine, misty rain drifted in\nat his windows as he sat at his breakfast. He took deep breaths of the\nmoisture, and it seemed to water and revive his parching soul. He found\nhimself, to his surprise, surveying with equanimity the pile of books in\nthe corner which had led him to the conviction of the emptiness of the\nuniverse--but the universe was no longer empty! It was cruel, but a\nwarring force was at work in it which was not blind, but directed. He\ncould not say why this was so, but he knew it, he felt it, sensed its\nenergy within him as he set out for Dalton Street.\n\nHe was neither happy nor unhappy, but in equilibrium, walking with sure\nsteps, and the anxiety in which he had fallen asleep the night before\nwas gone: anxiety lest the woman should have fled, or changed her mind,\nor committed some act of desperation.\n\nIn Dalton Street a thin coat of yellow mud glistened on the asphalt, but\neven the dreariness of this neighbourhood seemed transient. He rang the\nbell of the flat, the door swung open, and in the hall above a woman\nawaited him. She was clad in black.\n\n\"You wouldn't know me, would you?\" she inquired. \"Say, I scarcely know\nmyself. I used to wear this dress at Pratt's, with white collars and\ncuffs and--well, I just put it on again. I had it in the bottom of my\ntrunk, and I guessed you'd like it.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you at first,\" he said, and the pleasure in his face was\nher reward.\n\nThe transformation, indeed, was more remarkable than he could have\nbelieved possible, for respectability itself would seem to have been\nregained by a costume, and the abundance of her remarkable hair was now\nrepressed. The absence of paint made her cheeks strangely white, the\nhollows under the eyes darker. The eyes themselves alone betrayed the\nwoman of yesterday; they still burned.\n\n\"Why,\" he exclaimed, looking around him, \"you have been busy, haven't\nyou?\"\n\n\"I've been up since six,\" she told him proudly. The flat had been\ndismantled of its meagre furniture, the rug was rolled up and tied,\nand a trunk strapped with rope was in the middle of the floor. Her next\nremark brought home to him the full responsibility of his situation. She\nled him to the window, and pointed to a spot among the drenched weeds\nand rubbish in the yard next door. \"Do you see that bottle? That's\nthe first thing I did--flung it out there. It didn't break,\" she added\nsignificantly, \"and there are three drinks in it yet.\"\n\nOnce more he confined his approval to his glance.\n\n\"Now you must come and have some breakfast,\" he said briskly. \"If I had\nthought about it I should have waited to have it with you.\"\n\n\"I'm not hungry.\" In the light of his new knowledge, he connected her\nsudden dejection with the sight of the bottle.\n\n\"But you must eat. You're exhausted from all this work. And a cup of\ncoffee will make all the difference in the world.\"\n\nShe yielded, pinning on her hat. And he led her, holding the umbrella\nover her, to a restaurant in Tower Street, where a man in a white cap\nand apron was baking cakes behind a plate-glass window. She drank the\ncoffee, but in her excitement left the rest of the breakfast almost\nuntasted.\n\n\"Say,\" she asked him once, \"why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered, \"except that it gives me pleasure.\"\n\n\"Pleasure?\"\n\n\"Yes. It makes me feel as if I were of some use.\"\n\nShe considered this.\n\n\"Well,\" she observed, reviled by the coffee, \"you're the queerest\nminister I ever saw.\"\n\nWhen they had reached the pavement she asked him where they were going.\n\n\"To see a friend of mine, and a friend of yours,\" he told her. \"He does\nnet live far from here.\"\n\nShe was silent again, acquiescing. The rain had stopped, the sun was\npeeping out furtively through the clouds, the early loiterers in Dalton\nStreet stared at them curiously. But Hodder was thinking of that house\nwhither they were bound with a new gratitude, a new wonder that it\nshould exist. Thus they came to the sheltered vestibule with its\nglistening white paint, its polished name plate and doorknob. The\ngrinning, hospitable darky appeared in answer to the rector's ring.\n\n\"Good morning, Sam,\" he said; \"is Mr. Bentley in?\"\n\nSam ushered them ceremoniously into the library, and gate Marcy\ngazed about her with awe, as at something absolutely foreign to her\nexperience: the New Barrington Hotel, the latest pride of the city,\nrecently erected at the corner of Tower and Jefferson and furnished\nin the French style, she might partially have understood. Had she been\nmarvellously and suddenly transported and established there, existence\nmight still have evinced a certain continuity. But this house!..\n\nMr. Bentley rose from the desk in the corner.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, Hodder,\" he said cheerfully, laying his hand on the\nrector's arm. \"I was just thinking about you.\"\n\n\"This is Miss Marcy, Mr. Bentley,\" Hodder said.\n\nMr. Bentley took her hand and led her to a chair.\n\n\"Mr. Hodder knows how fond I am of young women,\" he said. \"I have six of\nthem upstairs,--so I am never lonely.\"\n\nMr. Bentley did not appear to notice that her lips quivered.\n\nHodder turned his eyes from her face. \"Miss Marcy has been lonely,\" he\nexplained, \"and I thought we might get her a room near by, where she\nmight see them often. She is going to do embroidery.\"\n\n\"Why, Sally will know of a room,\" Mr. Bentley replied. \"Sam!\" he called.\n\n\"Yessah--yes, Mistah Ho'ace.\" Sam appeared at the door.\n\n\"Ask Miss Sally to come down, if she's not busy.\"\n\nKate Marcy sat dumbly in her chair, her hands convulsively clasping its\narms, her breast heaving stormily, her face becoming intense with\nthe effort of repressing the wild emotion within her: emotion that\nthreatened to strangle her if resisted, or to sweep her out like a tide\nand drown her in deep waters: emotion that had no one mewing, and yet\nsummed up a life, mysteriously and overwhelmingly aroused by the sight\nof a room, and of a kindly old gentleman who lived in it!\n\nMr. Bentley took the chair beside her.\n\n\"Why, I believe it's going to clear off, after all,\" he exclaimed. \"Sam\npredicted it, before breakfast. He pretends to be able to tell by the\nflowers. After a while I must show you my flowers, Miss Marcy, and what\nDalton Street can do by way of a garden--Mr. Hodder could hardly believe\nit, even when he saw it.\" Thus he went on, the tips of his fingers\npressed together, his head bent forward in familiar attitude, his face\nlighted, speaking naturally of trivial things that seemed to suggest\nthemselves; and careful, with exquisite tact that did not betray itself,\nto address both. A passing automobile startled her with the blast of its\nhorn. \"I'm afraid I shall never get accustomed to them,\" he lamented.\n\"At first I used to be thankful there were no trolley cars on this\nstreet, but I believe the automobiles are worse.\"\n\nA figure flitted through the hall and into the room, which Hodder\nrecognized as Miss Grower's. She reminded him of a flying shuttle across\nthe warp of Mr. Bentley's threads, weaving them together; swift, sure,\nyet never hurried or flustered. One glance at the speechless woman\nseemed to suffice her for a knowledge of the situation.\n\n\"Mr. Hodder has brought us a new friend and neighbour, Sally,--Miss Kate\nMarcy. She is to have a room near us, that we may see her often.\"\n\nHodder watched Miss Grower's procedure with a breathless interest.\n\n\"Why, Mrs. McQuillen has a room--across the street, you know, Mr.\nBentley.\"\n\nSally perched herself on the edge of the armchair and laid her hand\nlightly on Kate Marcy's.\n\nEven Sally Grover was powerless to prevent the inevitable, and the touch\nof her hand seemed the signal for the release of the pent-up forces. The\nworn body, the worn nerves, the weakened will gave way, and Kate Marcy\nburst into a paroxysm of weeping that gradually became automatic,\nconvulsive, like a child's. There was no damming this torrent, once\nreleased. Kindness, disinterested friendship, was the one unbearable\nthing.\n\n\"We must bring her upstairs,\" said Sally Grover, quietly, \"she's going\nto pieces.\"\n\nHodder helping, they fairly carried her up the flight, and laid her on\nSally Grover's own bed.\n\nThat afternoon she was taken to Mrs. McQuillen's.\n\nThe fiends are not easily cheated. And during the nights and days that\nfollowed even Sally Grower, whose slight frame was tireless, whose\nstoicism was amazing, came out of the sick room with a white face and\ncompressed lips. Tossing on the mattress, Kate Marcy enacted over again\nincident after incident of her past life, events natural to an existence\nwhich had been largely devoid of self-pity, but which now, clearly\nenough, tested the extreme limits of suffering. Once more, in her\nvisions, she walked the streets, wearily measuring the dark, empty\nblocks, footsore, into the smaller hours of the night; slyly,\ninsinuatingly, pathetically offering herself--all she possessed--to the\nhovering beasts of prey. And even these rejected her, with gibes, with\nobscene jests that sprang to her lips and brought a shudder to those who\nheard.\n\nSometimes they beheld flare up fitfully that mysterious thing called\nthe human spirit, which all this crushing process had not served to\nextinguish. She seemed to be defending her rights, whatever these may\nhave been! She expostulated with policemen. And once, when Hodder was\npresent, she brought back vividly to his mind that first night he had\nseen her, when she had defied him and sent him away. In moments she\nlived over again the careless, reckless days when money and good looks\nhad not been lacking, when rich food and wines had been plentiful.\nAnd there were other events which Sally Grower and the good-natured\nIrishwoman, Mrs. McQuillen, not holding the key, could but dimly\ncomprehend. Education, environment, inheritance, character--what a\njumble of causes! What Judge was to unravel them, and assign the exact\namount of responsibility?\n\nThere were other terrible scenes when, more than semiconscious, she\ncried out piteously for drink, and cursed them for withholding it. And\nit was in the midst of one of these that an incident occurred which made\na deep impression upon young Dr. Giddings, hesitating with his opiates,\nand assisting the indomitable Miss Grower to hold his patient. In the\nmidst of the paroxysm Mr. Bentley entered and stood over her by the\nbedside, and suddenly her struggles ceased. At first she lay intensely\nstill, staring at him with wide eyes of fear. He sat down and took her\nhand, and spoke to her, quietly and naturally, and her pupils relaxed.\nShe fell into a sleep, still clinging to his fingers.\n\nIt was Sally who opposed the doctor's wish to send her to a hospital.\n\n\"If it's only a question of getting back her health, she'd better die,\"\nshe declared. \"We've got but one chance with her, Dr. Giddings, to keep\nher here. When she finds out she's been to a hospital, that will be the\nend of it with her kind. We'll never get hold of her again. I'll take\ncare of Mrs. McQuillen.\"\n\nDoctor Giddings was impressed by this wisdom.\n\n\"You think you have a chance, Miss Grower?\" he asked. He had had a\nhospital experience.\n\nMiss Grower was wont to express optimism in deeds rather than words.\n\n\"If I didn't think so, I'd ask you to put a little more in your\nhypodermic next time,\" she replied.\n\nAnd the doctor went away, wondering....\n\nDrink! Convalescence brought little release for the watchers. The fiends\nwould retire, pretending to have abandoned the field, only to swoop down\nagain when least expected. There were periods of calm when it seemed as\nthough a new and bewildered personality were emerging, amazed to find\nin life a kindly thing, gazing at the world as one new-born. And again,\nMrs. McQuillen or Ella Finley might be seen running bareheaded across\nthe street for Miss Grower. Physical force was needed, as the rector\ndiscovered on one occasion; physical force, and something more, a\ndauntlessness that kept Sally Grower in the room after the other women\nhad fled in terror. Then remorse, despondency, another fear....\n\nAs the weeks went by, the relapses certainly became fewer. Something was\nat work, as real in its effects as the sunlight, but invisible. Hodder\nfelt it, and watched in suspense while it fought the beasts in this\nwoman, rending her frame in anguish. The frame might succumb, the breath\nmight leave it to moulder, but the struggle, he knew, would go until the\nbeasts were conquered. Whence this knowledge?--for it was knowledge.\n\nOn the quieter days of her convalescence she seemed, indeed, more\nMadonna than Magdalen as she sat against the pillows, her red-gold hair\nlying in two heavy plaits across her shoulders, her cheeks pale; the\ninner, consuming fires that smouldered in her eyes died down. At such\ntimes her newly awakened innocence (if it might be called such--pathetic\ninnocence, in truth!) struck awe into Hodder; her wonder was matched\nby his own. Could there be another meaning in life than the pursuit of\npleasure, than the weary effort to keep the body alive?\n\nSuch was her query, unformulated. What animated these persons who had\nstruggled over her so desperately, Sally Grower, Mr. Bentley, and Hodder\nhimself? Thus her opening mind. For she had a mind.\n\nMr. Bentley was the chief topic, and little by little he became exalted\ninto a mystery of which she sought the explanation.\n\n\"I never knew anybody like him,\" she would exclaim.\n\n\"Why, I'd seen him on Dalton Street with the children following him, and\nI saw him again that day of the funeral. Some of the girls I knew used\nto laugh at him. We thought he was queer. And then, when you brought\nme to him that morning and he got up and treated me like a lady, I just\ncouldn't stand it. I never felt so terrible in my life. I just wanted\nto die, right then and there. Something inside of me kept pressing\nand pressing, until I thought I would die. I knew what it was to hate\nmyself, but I never hated myself as I have since then.\n\n\"He never says anything about God, and you don't, but when he comes in\nhere he seems like God to me. He's so peaceful,--he makes me peaceful.\nI remember the minister in Madison,--he was a putty-faced man with\nindigestion,--and when he prayed he used to close his eyes and try to\nlook pious, but he never fooled me. He never made me believe he knew\nanything about God. And don't think for a minute he'd have done what you\nand Miss Grower and Mr. Bentley did! He used to cross the street to\nget out of the way of drunken men--he wouldn't have one of them in his\nchurch. And I know of a girl he drove out of town because she had a\nbaby and her sweetheart wouldn't marry her. He sent her to hell. Hell's\nhere--isn't it?\"\n\nThese sudden remarks of hers surprised and troubled him. But they had\nanother effect, a constructive effect. He was astonished, in going over\nsuch conversations afterwards, to discover that her questions and\nhis efforts to answer them in other than theological terms were both\nilluminating and stimulating. Sayings in the Gospels leaped out in his\nmind, fired with new meanings; so simple, once perceived, that he was\namazed not to have seen them before. And then he was conscious of a\npalpitating joy which left in its wake a profound thankfulness. He made\nno attempt as yet to correlate these increments, these glimpses of truth\ninto a system, but stored them preciously away.\n\nHe taxed his heart and intellect to answer her sensible and helpfully,\nand thus found himself avoiding the logic, the Greek philosophy, the\noutworn and meaningless phrases of speculation; found himself employing\n(with extraordinary effect upon them both) the simple words from which\nmany of these theories had been derived. \"He that hath seen me hath seen\nthe Father.\" What she saw in Horace Bentley, he explained, was God. God\nwished us to know how to live, in order that we might find happiness,\nand therefore Christ taught us that the way to find happiness was to\nteach others how to live,--once we found out. Such was the meaning of\nChrist's Incarnation, to teach us how to live in order that we\nmight find God and happiness. And Hodder translated for her the word\nIncarnation.\n\nNow, he asked, how were we to recognize God, how might we know how he\nwished us to live, unless we saw him in human beings, in the souls into\nwhich he had entered? In Mr. Bentley's soul? Was this too deep?\n\nShe pondered, with flushed face.\n\n\"I never had it put to me like that,\" she said, presently. \"I never\ncould have known what you meant if I hadn't seen Mr. Bentley.\"\n\nHere was a return flash, for him. Thus, teaching he taught. From this\ngerm he was to evolve for himself the sublime truth that the world\ngrown better, not through automatic, soul-saving machinery, but by\nPersonality.\n\nOn another occasion she inquired about \"original sin;\"--a phrase which\nhad stuck in her memory since the stormings of the Madison preacher.\nHere was a demand to try his mettle.\n\n\"It means,\" he replied after a moment, \"that we are all apt to follow\nthe selfish, animal instincts of our matures, to get all we can for\nourselves without thinking of others, to seek animal pleasures. And we\nalways suffer for it.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" she agreed. \"That's what happened to me.\"\n\n\"And unless we see and know some one like Mr. Bentley,\" he went on,\nchoosing his words, \"or discover for ourselves what Christ was, and what\nhe tried to tell us, we go on 'suffering, because we don't see any way\nout. We suffer because we feel that we are useless, that other persons\nare doing our work.\"\n\n\"That's what hell is!\" She was very keen. \"Hell's here,\" she repeated.\n\n\"Hell may begin here, and so may heaven,\" he answered.\n\n\"Why, he's in heaven now!\" she exclaimed, \"it's funny I never thought of\nit before.\" Of course she referred to Mr. Bentley.\n\nThus; by no accountable process of reasoning, he stumbled into the path\nwhich was to lead him to one of the widest and brightest of his vistas,\nthe secret of eternity hidden in the Parable of the Talents! But it will\nnot do to anticipate this matter....\n\nThe divine in this woman of the streets regenerated by the divine in her\nfellow-creatures, was gasping like a new-born babe for breath. And with\nwhat anxiety they watched her! She grew strong again, went with Sally\nDrover and the other girls on Sunday excursions to the country, applied\nherself to her embroidery with restless zeal for days, only to have it\ndrop from her nerveless fingers. But her thoughts were uncontrollable,\nshe was drawn continually to the edge of that precipice which hung over\nthe waters whence they had dragged her, never knowing when the vertigo\nwould seize her. And once Sally Drover, on the alert for just such an\noccurrence, pursued her down Dalton Street and forced her back...\n\nJustice to Miss Drover cannot be done in these pages. It was she who\nbore the brunt of the fierce resentment of the reincarnated fiends when\nthe other women shrank back in fear, and said nothing to Mr. Bentley\nor Hodder until the incident was past. It was terrible indeed to behold\nthis woman revert--almost in the twinkling of an eye--to a vicious\nwretch crazed for drink, to feel that the struggle had to be fought all\nover again. Unable to awe Sally Drover's spirit, she would grow piteous.\n\n\"For God's sake let me go--I can't stand it. Let me go to hell--that's\nwhere I belong. What do you bother with me for? I've got a right.\"\n\nOnce the doctor had to be called. He shook his head but his eye met Miss\nGrower's, and he said nothing.\n\n\"I'll never be able to pull out, I haven't got the strength,\" she told\nHodder, between sobs. \"You ought to have left me be, that was where\nI belonged. I can't stand it, I tell you. If it wasn't for that woman\nwatching me downstairs, and Sally Grower, I'd have had a drink before\nthis. It ain't any use, I've got so I can't live without it--I don't\nwant to live.\"\n\nAnd then remorse, self-reproach, despair,--almost as terrible to\ncontemplate. She swore she would never see Mr. Bentley again, she\ncouldn't face him.\n\nYet they persisted, and gained ground. She did see Mr. Bentley, but what\nhe said to her, or she to him, will never be known. She didn't speak of\nit....\n\nLittle by little her interest was aroused, her pride in her work\nstimulated. None was more surprised than Hodder when Sally Grower\ninformed him that the embroidery was really good; but it was thought\nbest, for psychological reasons, to discard the old table-cover with its\nassociations and begin a new one. On occasional evenings she brought\nher sewing over to Mr. Bentley's, while Sally read aloud to him and the\nyoung women in the library. Miss Grower's taste in fiction was romantic;\nher voice (save in the love passages, when she forgot herself )\nsing-song, but new and unsuspected realms were opened up for Kate Marcy,\nwho would drop her work and gaze wide-eyed out of the window, into the\ndarkness.\n\nAnd it was Sally who must be given credit for the great experiment,\nalthough she took Mr. Bentley and Hodder into her confidence. On it\nthey staked all. The day came, at last, when the new table-cover was\nfinished. Miss Grower took it to the Woman's Exchange, actually sold it,\nand brought back the money and handed it to her with a smile, and left\nher alone.\n\nAn hour passed. At the end of it Kate Marcy came out of her room,\ncrossed the street, and knocked at the door of Mr. Bentley's library.\nHodder happened to be there.\n\n\"Come in,\" Mr. Bentley said.\n\nShe entered, breathless, pale. Her eyes, which had already lost much of\nthe dissipated look, were alight with exaltation. Her face bore evidence\nof the severity of the hour of conflict, and she was perilously near to\ntears. She handed Mr. Bentley the money.\n\n\"What's this, Kate?\" he asked, in his kindly way.\n\n\"It's what I earned, sir,\" she faltered. \"Miss Grower sold the\ntable-cover. I thought maybe you'd put it aside for me, like you do for\nthe others.\n\n\"I'll take good care of it,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, sir, I don't ever expect to repay you, and Miss Grower and Mr.\nHodder!\n\n\"Why, you are repaying us,\" he replied, cutting her short, \"you are\nmaking us all very happy. And Sally tells me at the Exchange they like\nyour work so well they are asking for more. I shouldn't have suspected,\"\nhe added, with a humorous glance at the rector, \"that Mr. Hodder knew so\nmuch about embroidery.\"\n\nHe rose, and put the money in his desk,--such was his genius for\navoiding situations which threatened to become emotional.\n\n\"I've started another one,\" she told them, as she departed.\n\nA few moments later Miss Grower appeared.\n\n\"Sally,\" said Mr. Bentley, \"you're a wise woman. I believe I've made\nthat remark before. You have managed that case wonderfully.\"\n\n\"There was a time,\" replied Miss Grower, thoughtfully, \"when it looked\npretty black. We've got a chance with her now, I think.\"\n\n\"I hope so. I begin to feel so,\" Mr. Bentley declared.\n\n\"If we succeed,\" Miss Grower went on, \"it will be through the heart. And\nif we lose her again, it will be through the heart.\"\n\nHodder started at this proof of insight.\n\n\"You know her history, Mr. Hodder?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, I don't. And I don't care to. But the way to get at Kate Marcy,\nlight as she is in some respects, is through her feelings. And she's\nsomehow kept 'em alive. We've got to trust her, from now on--that's the\nonly way. And that's what God does, anyhow.\"\n\nThis was one of Miss Grover's rare references to the Deity.\n\nTurning over that phrase in his mind, Hodder went slowly back towards\nthe parish house. God trusted individuals--even such as Kate Marcy. What\ndid that mean? Individual responsibility! He repeated it. Was the world\non that principle, then? It was as though a search-light were flung\nahead of him and he saw, dimly, a new order--a new order in government\nand religion. And, as though spoken by a voice out of the past, there\nsounded in his ears the text of that sermon which had so deeply moved\nhim, \"I will arise and go to my Father.\"\n\nThe church was still open, and under the influence of the same strange\nexcitement which had driven him to walk in the rain so long ago, he\nentered and went slowly up the marble aisle. Through the gathering gloom\nhe saw the figure on the cross. And as he stood gazing at it, a message\nfor which he had been waiting blazed up within him.\n\nHe would not leave the Church!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE RIDDLE OF CAUSATION\n\n\nI\n\nIn order to portray this crisis in the life of Kate Marcy, the outcome\nof which is still uncertain, other matters have been ignored.\n\nHow many persons besides John Hodder have seemed to read--in crucial\nperiods--a meaning into incidents having all the outward appearance\nof accidents! What is it that leads us to a certain man or woman at a\ncertain time, or to open a certain book? Order and design? or influence?\n\nThe night when he had stumbled into the cafe in Dalton Street might well\nhave been termed the nadir of Hodder's experience. His faith had been\nblotted out, and, with it had suddenly been extinguished all spiritual\nsense, The beast had taken possession. And then, when it was least\nexpected,--nay, when despaired of, had come the glimmer of a\nlight; distant, yet clear. He might have traced the course of his\ndisillusionment, perhaps, but cause and effect were not discernible\nhere.\n\nThey soon became so, and in the weeks that followed he grew to have the\nodd sense of a guiding hand on his shoulder,--such was his instinctive\ninterpretation of it, rather than the materialistic one of things\nordained. He might turn, in obedience to what seemed a whim, either to\nthe right or left, only to recognize new blazes that led him on with\nsurer step; and trivial accidents became events charged with meaning. He\nlived in continual wonder.\n\nOne broiling morning, for instance, he gathered up the last of the books\nwhose contents he had a month before so feverishly absorbed, and which\nhad purged him of all fallacies. At first he had welcomed them with a\nfierce relief, sucked them dry, then looked upon them with loathing. Now\nhe pressed them gratefully, almost tenderly, as he made his way along\nthe shady side of the street towards the great library set in its little\npark.\n\nHe was reminded, as he passed from the blinding sunlight into the cool\nentrance hall, with its polished marble stairway and its statuary, that\nEldon Parr's munificence had made the building possible: that some day\nMr. Parr's bust would stand in that vestibule with that of Judge Henry\nGoodrich--Philip Goodrich's grandfather--and of other men who had served\ntheir city and their commonwealth.\n\nUpstairs, at the desk, he was handing in the volumes to the young woman\nwhose duty it was to receive them when he was hailed by a brisk little\nman in an alpaca coat, with a skin like brown parchment.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Hodder,\" he exclaimed cheerfully, with a trace of German\naccent, \"I had an idea you were somewhere on the cool seas with our\nfriend, Mr. Parr. He spoke, before he left, of inviting you.\"\n\nIt had been Eldon Parr, indeed, who had first brought Hodder to\nthe library, shortly after the rector's advent, and Mr. Engel had\naccompanied them on a tour of inspection; the financier himself had\nenjoined the librarian to \"take good care\" of the clergyman. Mr. Waring,\nMr. Atterbury; and Mr. Constable were likewise trustees. And since then,\nwhen talking to him, Hodder had had a feeling that Mr. Engel was not\nunconscious of the aura--if it may be called such--of his vestry.\n\nMr. Engel picked up one of the books as it lay on the counter, and as he\nread the title his face betrayed a slight surprise.\n\n\"Modern criticism!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"You have found me out,\" the rector acknowledged, smiling.\n\n\"Came into my room, and have a chat,\" said the librarian, coaxingly.\n\nIt was a large chamber at the corner of the building, shaded by awnings,\nagainst which brushed the branches of an elm which had belonged to the\noriginal park. In the centre of the room was a massive oak desk, one\nwhole side of which was piled high with new volumes.\n\n\"Look there,\" said the librarian, with a quick wave of his hand, \"those\nare some which came in this week, and I had them put here to look\nover. Two-thirds of 'em on religion, or religious philosophy. Does that\nsuggest anything to you clergymen?\"\n\n\"Do many persons read them, Mr. Engel?\" said the rector, at length.\n\n\"Read them!\" cried Mr. Engel, quizzically. \"We librarians are a sort of\nweather-vanes, if people only knew enough to consult us. We can hardly\nget a sufficient number of these new religious books the good ones, I\nmean--to supply the demand. And the Lord knows what trash is devoured,\nfrom what the booksellers tell me. It reminds me of the days when this\nlibrary was down on Fifth Street, years ago, and we couldn't supply\nenough Darwins and Huxleys and Spencers and popular science generally.\nThat was an agnostic age. But now you'd be surprised to see the\ndifferent kinds of men and women who come demanding books on\nreligion--all sorts and conditions. They're beginning to miss it out of\ntheir lives; they want to know. If my opinion's worth anything, I\nshould not hesitate to declare that we're on the threshold of a greater\nreligious era than the world has ever seen.\"\n\nHodder thrust a book back into the pile, and turned abruptly, with a\nmanner that surprised the librarian. No other clergyman to whom he had\nspoken on this subject had given evidence of this strong feeling,\nand the rector of St. John's was the last man from whom he would have\nexpected it.\n\n\"Do you really think so?\" Hodder demanded.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said Mr. Engel, when he had recovered from his astonishment.\n\"I'm sure of it. I think clergymen especially--if you will pardon\nme--are apt to forget that this is a reading age. That a great many\npeople who used to get what instruction they had--ahem--from churches,\nfor instance, now get it from books. I don't want to say anything to\noffend you, Mr. Hodder--\"\n\n\"You couldn't,\" interrupted the rector. He was equally surprised at the\ndiscovery that he had misjudged Mr. Engel, and was drawn towards him now\nwith a strong sympathy and curiosity.\n\n\"Well,\" replied Mr. Engel, \"I'm glad to hear you say that.\" He\nrestrained a gasp. Was this the orthodox Mr. Hodder of St. John's?\n\n\"Why,\" said Hodder, sitting down, \"I've learned, as you have, by\nexperience. Only my experience hasn't been so hopeful as yours--that is,\nif you regard yours as hopeful. It would be hypocritical of me not to\nacknowledge that the churches are losing ground, and that those who\nought to be connected with them are not. I am ready to admit that the\nchurches are at fault. But what you tell me of people reading these\nbooks gives me more courage than I have had for--for some time.\"\n\n\"Is it so!\" ejaculated the little man, relapsing into the German idiom\nof his youth.\n\n\"It is,\" answered the rector, with an emphasis not to be denied. \"I wish\nyou would give me your theory about this phenomenon, and speak frankly.\"\n\n\"But I thought--\" the bewildered librarian began. \"I saw you had been\nreading those books, but I thought--\"\n\n\"Naturally you did,\" said Holder, smiling. His personality, his\nascendency, his poise, suddenly felt by the other, were still more\nconfusing. \"You thought me a narrow, complacent, fashionable priest who\nhad no concern as to what happened outside the walls of his church, who\nstuck obstinately to dogmas and would give nothing else a hearing. Well,\nyou were right.\"\n\n\"Ah, I didn't think all that,\" Mr. Engel protested, and his parchment\nskin actually performed the miracle of flushing. \"I am not so stupid.\nAnd once, long ago when I was young, I was going to be a minister\nmyself.\"\n\n\"What prevented you?\" asked Holder, interested.\n\n\"You want me to be frank--yes, well, I couldn't take the vows.\" The\nbrown eyes of the quiet, humorous, self-contained and dried-up custodian\nof the city's reading flamed up. \"I felt the call,\" he exclaimed. \"You\nmay not credit it to look at me now, Mr. Hodder. They said to me, 'here\nis what you must swear to believe before you can make men and women\nhappier and more hopeful, rescue them from sin and misery!' You know\nwhat it was.\"\n\nHodder nodded.\n\n\"It was a crime. It had nothing to do with religion. I thought it over\nfor a year--I couldn't. Oh, I have since been thankful. I can see now\nwhat would have happened to me--I should have had fatty degeneration of\nthe soul.\"\n\nThe expression was not merely forcible, it was overwhelming. It brought\nup before Holder's mind, with sickening reality, the fate he had himself\nescaped. Fatty degeneration of the soul!\n\nThe little man, seeing the expression on the rector's face, curbed his\nexcitement, and feared he had gone too far.\n\n\"You will pardon me!\" he said penitently, \"I forget myself. I did not\nmean all clergymen.\"\n\n\"I have never heard it put so well,\" Holder declared. \"That is exactly\nwhat occurs in many cases.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is that,\" said Engel, still puzzled, but encouraged, eyeing the\nstrong face of the other. \"And they lament that the ministry hasn't\nmore big men. Sometimes they get one with the doctrinal type of mind--a\nNewman--but how often? And even a Newman would be of little avail\nto-day. It is Eucken who says that the individual, once released from\nexternal authority, can never be turned back to it. And they have been\nreleased by the hundreds of thousands ever since Luther's time, are\nbeing freed by the hundreds of thousands to-day. Democracy, learning,\nscience, are releasing them, and no man, no matter how great he may be,\ncan stem that tide. The able men in the churches now--like your Phillips\nBrooks, who died too soon--are beginning to see this. They are those who\ndeveloped after the vows of the theological schools were behind them.\nRemove those vows, and you will see the young men come. Young men are\nidealists, Mr. Hodder, and they embrace other professions where the mind\nis free, and which are not one whit better paid than the ministry.\n\n\"And what is the result,\" he cried, \"of the senseless insistence on the\nletter instead of the spirit of the poetry of religion? Matthew Arnold\nwas a thousand times right when he inferred that Jesus Christ never\nspoke literally and yet he is still being taken literally by most\nchurches, and all the literal sayings which were put into his mouth\nare maintained as Gospel truth! What is the result of proclaiming\nChristianity in terms of an ancient science and theology which awaken\nno quickening response in the minds and hearts of to-day? That!\" The\nlibrarian thrust a yellow hand towards the pile of books. \"The new wine\nhas burst the old skin and is running all over the world. Ah, my friend,\nif you could only see, as I do, the yearning for a satisfying religion\nwhich exists in this big city! It is like a vacuum, and those books\nare rushing to supply it. I little thought,\" he added dreamily, \"when\nI renounced the ministry in so much sorrow that one day I should have\na church of my own. This library is my church, and men and women of all\ncreeds come here by the thousands. But you must pardon me. I have been\ncarried away--I forgot myself.\"\n\n\"Mr. Engel,\" replied the rector, \"I want you to regard me as one of your\nparishioners.\"\n\nThe librarian looked at him mutely, and the practical, desiccated little\nperson seemed startlingly transformed into a mediaeval, German mystic.\n\n\"You are a great man, Mr. Hodder,\" he said. \"I might have guessed it.\"\n\nIt was one of the moments when protest would have been trite,\nsuperfluous. And Hodder, in truth, felt something great swelling within\nhim, something that was not himself, and yet strangely was. But just\nwhat--in view of his past strict orthodoxy and limited congregation--Mr.\nEngel meant, he could not have said. Had the librarian recognized,\nwithout confession on his part, the change in him? divined his future\nintentions?\n\n\"It is curious that I should have met you this morning, Mr. Engel,\" he\nsaid. \"I expressed surprise when you declared this was a religious age,\nbecause you corroborated something I had felt, but of which I had no\nsufficient proof. I felt that a great body of unsatisfied men and women\nexisted, but that I was powerless to get in touch with them; I had\ndiscovered that truth, as you have so ably pointed out, is disguised and\ndistorted by ancient dogmas; and that the old Authority, as you say, no\nlonger carries weight.\"\n\n\"Have you found the new one?\" Mr. Engel demanded.\n\n\"I think I have,\" the rector answered calmly, \"it lies in personality. I\ndo not know whether you will agree with me that the Church at large has\na future, and I will confess to you that there was a time when I thought\nshe had not. I see now that she has, once given to her ministers that\nfreedom to develop of which you speak. In spite of the fact that truth\nhas gradually been revealed to the world by what may be called an\nApostolic Succession of Personalities,--Augustine, Dante, Francis of\nAssisi, Luther, Shakespeare, Milton, and our own Lincoln and Phillips\nBrooks,--to mention only a few,--the Church as a whole has been blind to\nit. She has insisted upon putting the individual in a straitjacket, she\nhas never recognized that growth is the secret of life, that the clothes\nof one man are binding on another.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are right--a thousand times right,\" cried the librarian.\n\"You have read Royce, perhaps, when he says, 'This mortal shall put on\nindividuality--'\"\n\n\"No,\" said the rector, outwardly cool, but inwardly excited by the\ncoruscation of this magnificent paraphrase of Paul's sentence, by the\nextraordinary turn the conversation had taken. \"I am ashamed to own that\nI have not followed the development of modern philosophy. The books\nI have just returned, on historical criticism,\" he went on, after a\nmoment's hesitation, \"infer what my attitude has been toward modern\nthought. We were made acquainted with historical criticism in the\ntheological seminary, but we were also taught to discount it. I have\ndiscounted it, refrained from reading it,--until now. And yet I have\nheard it discussed in conferences, glanced over articles in the reviews.\nI had, you see, closed the door of my mind. I was in a state where\narguments make no impression.\"\n\nThe librarian made a gesture of sympathetic assent, which was also a\ntribute to the clergyman's frankness.\n\n\"You will perhaps wonder how I could have lived these years in an\natmosphere of modern thought and have remained uninfluenced. Well, I\nhave recently been wondering--myself.\" Hodder smiled. \"The name of Royce\nis by no means unfamiliar to me, and he taught at Harvard when I was\nan undergraduate. But the prevailing philosophy of that day among the\nstudents was naturalism. I represent a revolt from it. At the seminary I\nimbibed a certain amount of religious philosophy--but I did not continue\nit, as thousands of my more liberal fellow-clergymen have done. My\nreligion 'worked' during the time, at least, I remained in my first\nparish. I had no interest in reconciling, for instance, the doctrine of\nevolution with the argument for design. Since I have been here in this\ncity,\" he added, simply, \"my days have been filled with a continued\nperplexity--when I was not too busy to think. Yes, there was an\nunacknowledged element of fear in my attitude, though I comforted myself\nwith the notion that opinions, philosophical and scientific, were in a\nstate of flux.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Mr. Engel, \"I comprehend. But, from the manner in which\nyou spoke just now, I should have inferred that you have been reading\nmodern philosophy--that of the last twenty years. Ah, you have\nsomething before you, Mr. Hodder. You will thank God, with me, for that\nphilosophy. It has turned the tide, set the current running the other\nway. Philosophy is no longer against religion, it is with it. And if\nyou were to ask me to name one of the greatest religious teachers of\nour age, I should answer, William James. And there is Royce, of whom I\nspoke,--one of our biggest men. The dominant philosophies of our times\nhave grown up since Arnold wrote his 'Literature and Dogma,' and they\nare in harmony with the quickening social spirit of the age, which is a\nreligious spirit--a Christian spirit, I call it. Christianity is coming\nto its own. These philosophies, which are not so far apart, are the\nflower of the thought of the centuries, of modern science, of that most\nextraordinary of discoveries, modern psychology. And they are far from\nexcluding religion, from denying the essential of Christ's teachings.\nOn the other hand, they grant that the motive-power of the world is\nspiritual.\n\n\"And this,\" continued Mr. Engel, \"brings me to another aspect of\nauthority. I wonder if it has struck you? In mediaeval times, when a\nbishop spoke ex cathedra, his authority, so far as it carried weight,\ncame from two sources. First, the supposed divine charter of the Church\nto save and damn. That authority is being rapidly swept away. Second, he\nspoke with all the weight of the then accepted science and philosophy.\nBut as soon as the new science began to lay hold on people's minds,\nas--for instance--when Galileo discovered that the earth moved instead\nof the sun (and the pope made him take it back), that second authority\nbegan to crumble too. In the nineteenth century science had grown so\nstrong that the situation looked hopeless. Religion had apparently\nirrevocably lost that warrant also, and thinking men not spiritually\ninclined, since they had to make a choice between science and religion,\ntook science as being the more honest, the more certain.\n\n\"And now what has happened? The new philosophies have restored your\nsecond Authority, and your first, as you properly say, is replaced\nby the conception of Personality. Personality is nothing but the\nrehabilitation of the prophet, the seer. Get him, as Hatch says, back\ninto your Church. The priests with their sacrifices and automatic rites,\nthe logicians, have crowded him out. Why do we read the Old Testament at\nall? Not for the laws of the Levites, not for the battles and hangings,\nbut for the inspiration of the prophets. The authority of the prophet\ncomes through personality, the source of which is in what Myers calls\nthe infinite spiritual world--in God. It was Christ's own authority.\n\n\"And as for your other authority, your ordinary man, when he reads\nmodern philosophy, says to himself, this does not conflict with science?\nBut he gets no hint, when he goes to most churches, that there is,\nbetween the two, no real quarrel, and he turns away in despair. He may\naccept the pragmatism of James, the idealism of Royce, or even what is\ncalled neo realism. In any case, he gains the conviction that a force\nfor good is at worn in the world, and he has the incentive to become\npart of it..... But I have given you a sermon!\"\n\n\"For which I can never be sufficiently, grateful,\" said Hodder, with an\nearnestness not to be mistaken.\n\nThe little man's eyes rested admiringly, and not without emotion, on the\nsalient features of the tall clergyman. And when he spoke again, it was\nin acknowledgment of the fact that he had read Hodder's purpose.\n\n\"You will have opposition, my friend. They will fight you--some persons\nwe know. They do not wish--what you and I desire. But you will not\nsurrender--I knew it.\" Mr. Engel broke off abruptly, and rang a bell on\nhis desk. \"I will make out for you a list. I hope you may come in again,\noften. We shall have other talks,--yes? I am always here.\"\n\nThen it came to pass that Hodder carried back with him another armful of\nbooks. Those he had brought back were the Levellers of the False. These\nwere the Builders of the True.\n\n\n\nII\n\nHodder had known for many years that the writings of Josiah Royce and of\nWilliam James had \"been in the air,\" so to speak, and he had heard them\nmentioned at dinner parties by his more intellectual parishioners, such\nas Mrs. Constable and Martha Preston. Now he was able to smile at his\nformer attitude toward these moderns, whose perusal he had deprecated as\ntreason to the saints! And he remembered his horror on having listened\nto a fellow-clergyman discuss with calmness the plan of the \"Varieties\nof Religious Experiences.\" A sacrilegious dissection of the lives\nof these very saints! The scientific process, the theories of modern\npsychology applied with sang-froid to the workings of God in the human\nsoul! Science he had regarded as the proclaimed enemy of religion, and\nin these days of the apotheosis of science not even sacred things were\nspared.\n\nNow Hodder saw what the little librarian had meant by an authority\nrestored. The impartial method of modern science had become so firmly\nestablished in the mind of mankind by education and reading that the\nancient unscientific science of the Roman Empire, in which orthodox\nChristianity was clothed, no longer carried authority. In so far as\nmodern science had discovered truth, religion had no quarrel with it.\nAnd if theology pretended to be the science of religion, surely it\nmust submit to the test of the new science! The dogged clinging to the\narchaic speculations of apologists, saints, and schoolmen had brought\nreligion to a low ebb indeed.\n\nOne of the most inspiring books he read was by an English clergyman of\nhis own Church whom he had formerly looked upon as a heretic, with all\nthat the word had once implied. It was a frank yet reverent study of the\nself-consciousness of Christ, submitting the life and teachings of\nJesus to modern criticism and the scientific method. And the Saviour's\ndivinity, rather than being lessened, was augmented. Hodder found it\ninfinitely refreshing that the so-called articles of Christian belief,\ninstead of being put first and their acceptance insisted upon, were made\nthe climax of the investigation.\n\nReligion, he began to perceive, was an undertaking, are attempt to\nfind unity and harmony of the soul by adopting, after mature thought,\na definite principle in life. If harmony resulted,--if the principle\nworked, it was true. Hodder kept an open mind, but he became a\npragmatist so far. Science, on the other hand, was in a sphere by\nherself, and need have no conflict with religion; science was not an\nundertaking, but an impartial investigation by close observation of\nfacts in nature. Her object was to discover truths by these methods\nalone. She had her theories, indeed, but they must be submitted to\nrigorous tests. This from a book by Professor Perry, an advocate of the\nnew realism.\n\nOn the other hand there were signs that modern science, by infinitesimal\ndegrees, might be aiding in the solution of the Mystery....\n\nBut religion, Hodder saw, was trusting. Not credulous, silly trusting,\nbut thoughtful trusting, accepting such facts as were definitely known.\nFaith was trusting. And faith without works was dead simply because\nthere could be no faith without works. There was no such thing as belief\nthat did not result in act.\n\nA paragraph which made a profound impression on Hodder at that time\noccurs in James's essay, \"Is life worth living?\"\n\n\"Now-what do I mean by I trusting? Is the word to carry with it\nlicense to define in detail an invisible world, and to authorize and\nexcommunicate those whose trust is different?... Our faculties of belief\nwere not given us to make orthodoxies and heresies withal; they were\ngiven us to live by. And to trust our religions demands men first of all\nto live in the light of them, and to act as if the invisible world which\nthey suggest were real. It is a fact of human nature that man can live\nand die by the help of a sort of faith that goes without a single dogma\nand definition.\"\n\nYet it was not these religious philosophies which had saved him, though\nthe stimulus of their current had started his mind revolving like a\nmotor. Their function, he perceived now, was precisely to compel him\nto see what had saved him, to reenforce it with the intellect, with\nthe reason, and enable him to save others. The current set up,--by a\nthousand suggestions of which he made notes,--a personal construction,\ncoordination, and he had the exhilaration of feeling, within him, a\ncreative process all his own. Behold a mystery 'a paradox'--one of many.\nAs his strength grew greater day by day, as his vision grew clearer, he\nmust exclaim with Paul: \"Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with\nme!\"\n\nHe, Hodder, was but an instrument transmitting power. And yet--oh\nparadox!--the instrument continued to improve, to grow stronger, to\ndevelop individuality and personality day by day! Life, present and\nhereafter, was growth, development, the opportunity for service in a\ncause. To cease growing was to die.\n\nHe perceived at last the form all religion takes is that of consecration\nto a Cause,--one of God's many causes. The meaning of life is to find\none's Cause, to lose one's self in it. His was the liberation of the\nWord,--now vouchsafed to him; the freeing of the spark from under the\nashes. The phrase was Alison's. To help liberate the Church, fan into\nflame the fire which was to consume the injustice, the tyranny, the\nselfishness of the world, until the Garvins, the Kate Marcys, the\nstunted children, and anaemic women were no longer possible.\n\nIt was Royce who, in one illuminating sentence, solved for him the\npuzzle, pointed out whence his salvation had come. \"For your cause can\nonly be revealed to you through some presence that first teaches you\nto love the unity of the spiritual life... You must find it in human\nshape.\"\n\nHorace Bentley!\n\nHe, Hodder, had known this, but known it vaguely, without sanction. The\nlight had shone for him even in the darkness of that night in Dalton\nStreet, when he thought to have lost it forever. And he had awakened\nthe next morning, safe,--safe yet bewildered, like a half drowned man on\nwarm sands in the sun.\n\n\"The will of the spiritual world, the divine will, revealed in man.\"\nWhat sublime thoughts, as old as the Cross itself, yet continually and\neternally new!\n\n\n\nIII\n\nThere was still another whose face was constantly before him, and the\nreflection of her distressed yet undaunted soul,--Alison Parr. The\ncontemplation of her courage, of her determination to abide by nothing\nsave the truth, had had a power over him that he might not estimate, and\nhe loved her as a man loves a woman, for her imperfections. And he loved\nher body and her mind.\n\nOne morning, as he walked back from Mrs. Bledsoe's through an\nunfrequented, wooded path of the Park, he beheld her as he had summoned\nher in his visions. She was sitting motionless, gazing before her with\nclear eyes, as at the Fates...\n\nShe started on suddenly perceiving him, but it was characteristic of her\ngreeting that she seemed to feel no surprise at the accident which had\nbrought them together.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" he said, smiling, \"that I have broken in on some profound\nreflections.\"\n\nShe did not answer at once, but looked up at him, as he stood over her,\nwith one of her strange, baffling gazes, in which there was the hint of\na welcoming smile.\n\n\"Reflection seems to be a circular process with me,\" she answered. \"I\nnever get anywhere--like you.\"\n\n\"Like me!\" he exclaimed, seating himself on the bench. Apparently their\nintercourse, so long as it should continue, was destined to be on the\nbasis of intimacy in which it had begun. It was possible at once to be\naware of her disturbing presence, and yet to feel at home in it.\n\n\"Like you, yes,\" she said, continuing to examine him. \"You've changed\nremarkably.\"\n\nIn his agitation, at this discovery of hers he again repeated her words.\n\n\"Why, you seem happier, you look happier. It isn't only that, I can't\nexplain how you impress me. It struck me when you were talking to Mr.\nBentley the other day. You seem to see something you didn't see when\nI first met you, that you didn't see the first time we were at Mr.\nBentley's together. Your attitude is fixed--directed. You have made a\ndecision of some sort--a momentous one, I rather think.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"you are right. It's more than remarkable that you\nshould have guessed it.\"\n\nShe remained silent\n\n\"I have decided,\" he found himself saying abruptly, \"to continue in the\nChurch.\"\n\nStill she was silent, until he wondered whether she would answer him. He\nhad often speculated to himself how she would take this decision, but\nhe could make no surmise from her expression as she stared off into the\nwood. Presently she turned her head, slowly, and looked into his face.\nStill she did not speak.\n\n\"You are wondering how I can do it,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she acknowledged, in a low voice.\n\n\"I should like you to know--that is why I spoke of it. You have never\nasked me, and I have never told you that the convictions I formerly\nheld I lost. And with them, for a while, went everything. At least so I\nbelieved.\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" she answered, \"I could see that, too.\"\n\n\"When I argued with you, that afternoon,--the last time we talked\ntogether alone,--I was trying to convince myself, and you--\" he\nhesitated, \"--that there was something. The fact that you could not seem\nto feel it stimulated me.\"\n\nHe read in her eyes that she understood him. And he dared not, nor did\nhe need to emphasize further his own intense desire that she should find\na solution of her own.\n\n\"I wish you to know what I am telling you for two reasons,\" he went on.\n\"It was you who spoke the words that led to the opening of my eyes\nto the situation into which I had been drifting for two years, who\ncompelled me to look upon the inconsistencies and falsities which had\ngradually been borne in upon me. It was you, I think, who gave me the\ncourage to face this situation squarely, since you possess that kind of\ncourage yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she cried. \"You would have done it anyway.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, to get himself in hand.\n\n\"For this reason, I owed it to you to speak--to thank you. I have\nrealized, since that first meeting, that you became my friend then, and\nthat you spoke as a friend. If you had not believed in my sincerity,\nyou would not have spoken. I wish you to know that I am fully aware and\ngrateful for the honour you did me, and that I realize it is not always\neasy for you to speak so--to any one.\"\n\nShe did not reply.\n\n\"There is another reason for my telling you now of this decision of\nmine to remain a clergyman,\" he continued. \"It is because I value your\nrespect and friendship, and I hope you will believe that I would not\ntake this course unless I saw my way clear to do it with sincerity.\"\n\n\"One has only to look at you to see that you are sincere,\" she said\ngently, with a thrill in her voice that almost unmanned him. \"I told\nyou once that I should never have forgiven myself if I had wrecked your\nlife. I meant it. I am very glad.\"\n\nIt was his turn to be silent.\n\n\"Just because I cannot see how it would be possible to remain in the\nChurch after one had been--emancipated, so to speak,\"--she smiled at\nhim,--\"is no reason why you may not have solved the problem.\"\n\nSuch was the superfine quality of her honesty. Yet she trusted him! He\nwas made giddy by a desire, which he fought down, to justify himself\nbefore her. His eye beheld her now as the goddess with the scales in\nher hand, weighing and accepting with outward calm the verdict of the\nbalance .... Outward calm, but inner fire.\n\n\"It makes no difference,\" she pursued evenly, bent on choosing her\nwords, \"that I cannot personally understand your emancipation, that mine\nis different. I can only see the preponderance of evil, of deception,\nof injustice--it is that which shuts out everything else. And it's\ntemperamental, I suppose. By looking at you, as I told you, I can see\nthat your emancipation is positive, while mine remains negative. You\nhave somehow regained a conviction that the good is predominant, that\nthere is some purpose in the universe.\"\n\nHe assented. Once more she relapsed into thought, while he sat\ncontemplating her profile. She turned to him again with a tremulous\nsmile.\n\n\"But isn't a conviction that the good is predominant, that there is a\npurpose in the universe, a long way from the positive assertions in\nthe Creeds?\" she asked. \"I remember, when I went through what you would\nprobably call disintegration, and which seemed to me enlightenment, that\nthe Creeds were my first stumbling-blocks. It seemed wrong to repeat\nthem.\"\n\n\"I am glad you spoke of this,\" he replied gravely. \"I have arrived at\nmany answers to that difficulty--which did not give me the trouble I had\nanticipated. In the first place, I am convinced that it was much more of\na difficulty ten, twenty, thirty years ago than it is to-day. That which\nI formerly thought was a radical tendency towards atrophy, the drift of\nthe liberal party in my own Church and others, as well as that which\nI looked upon with some abhorrence as the free-thinking speculation\nof many modern writers, I have now come to see is reconstruction.\nThe results of this teaching of religion in modern terms are already\nbecoming apparent, and some persons are already beginning to see that\nthe Creeds express certain elemental truths in frankly archaic\nlanguage. All this should be explained in the churches and the Sunday\nschools,--is, in fact, being explained in some, and also in books for\npopular reading by clergymen of my own Church, both here and in England.\nWe have got past the critical age.\"\n\nShe followed him closely, but did not interrupt.\n\n\"I do not mean to say that the Creeds are not the sources of much\nmisunderstanding, but in my opinion they do not constitute a sufficient\nexcuse for any clergyman to abandon his Church on account of them.\nIndeed there are many who interpret them by modern thought--which is\ncloser to the teachings of Christ than ancient thought--whose honesty\ncannot be questioned. Personally, I think that the Creeds either ought\nto be taken out of the service; or changed, or else there should be\na note inserted in the service and catechism definitely permitting\na liberal interpretation which is exactly what so many clergymen,\ncandidly, do now.\n\n\"When I was ordained a deacon, and then a priest, I took vows which\nwould appear to be literally conflicting. Compelled to choose between\nthese vows, I accept that as supreme which I made when I affirmed that\nI would teach nothing which I should be persuaded might not be concluded\nand affirmed by the Scripture. The Creeds were derived from the\nScripture--not the Scripture from the Creeds. As an individual among a\nbody of Christians I am powerless to change either the ordinal vows or\nthe Creeds, I am obliged to wait for the consensus of opinion. But if,\non the whole, I can satisfy my conscience in repeating the Creeds and\nreading the service, as other honest men are doing--if I am convinced\nthat I have an obvious work to do in that Church, it would be cowardly\nfor me to abandon that work.\"\n\nHer eyes lighted up.\n\n\"I see what you mean,\" she said, \"by staying in you can do many things\nthat you could not do, you can help to bring about the change, by being\nfrank. That is your point of view. You believe in the future of the\nChurch.\"\n\n\"I believe in an universal, Christian organization,\" he replied.\n\n\"But while stronger men are honest,\" she objected, \"are not your ancient\nvows and ancient Creeds continually making weaker men casuists?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" he agreed vigorously, and thought involuntarily of Mr.\nEngel's phrased fatty degeneration of the soul. \"Yet I can see the\nsigns, on all sides, of a gradual emancipation, of which I might be\ndeemed an example.\" A smile came into his eyes, like the sun on a\ngrey-green sea.\n\n\"Oh, you could never be a casuist!\" she exclaimed, with a touch of\nvehemence. \"You are much too positive. It is just that note, which is\ncharacteristic of so many clergymen, that note of smoothing-over and\napology, which you lack. I could never feel it, even when you were\northodox. And now--\" words failed her as she inspected his ruggedness.\n\n\"And now,\" he took her up, to cover his emotion, \"now I am not to be\nclassified!\"\n\nStill examining him, she reflected on this.\n\n\"Classified? Isn't it because you're so much of an individual that one\nfails to classify you? You represent something new to my experience,\nsomething which seems almost a contradiction--an emancipated Church.\"\n\n\"You imagined me out of the Church,--but where?\" he demanded.\n\n\"That's just it,\" she wondered intimately, \"where? When I try, I can see\nno other place for you. Your place as in the pulpit.\"\n\nHe uttered a sharp exclamation, which she did not heed.\n\n\"I can't imagine you doing institutional work, as it is called,--you're\nnot fitted for it, you'd be wasted in it. You gain by the historic\nsetting of the Church, and yet it does not absorb you. Free to preach\nyour convictions, unfettered, you will have a power over people that\nwill be tremendous. You have a very strong personality.\"\n\nShe set his heart, his mind, to leaping by this unexpected confirmation\non her part of his hopes, and yet the man in him was intent upon the\nwoman. She had now the air of detached judgment, while he could not\nrefrain from speculating anxiously on the effect of his future course on\nher and on their intimate relationship. He forbore from thinking, now,\nof the looming events which might thrust them apart,--put a physical\ndistance between them,--his anxiety was concerned with the possible\nsnapping of the thread of sympathy which had bound them. In this\nrespect, he dreaded her own future as much as his own. What might she\ndo? For he felt, in her, a potential element of desperation; a capacity\nto commit, at any moment, an irretrievable act.\n\n\"Once you have made your ideas your own,\" she mused, \"you will have the\npower of convincing people.\"\n\n\"And yet--\"\n\n\"And yet\"--she seized his unfinished sentence, \"you are not at all\npositive of convincing me. I'll give you the credit of forbearing to\nmake proselytes.\" She smiled at him.\n\nThus she read him again.\n\n\"If you call making proselytes a desire to communicate a view of life\nwhich gives satisfaction--\" he began, in his serious way.\n\n\"Oh, I want to be convinced!\" she exclaimed, penitently, \"I'd give\nanything to feel as you feel. There's something lacking in me, there\nmust be, and I have only seen the disillusionizing side. You infer that\nthe issue of the Creeds will crumble,--preach the new, and the old will\nfall away of itself. But what is the new? How, practically, do you deal\nwith the Creeds? We have got off that subject.\"\n\n\"You wish to know?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes--I wish to know.\"\n\n\"The test of any doctrine is whether it can be translated into life,\nwhether it will make any difference to the individual who accepts it.\nThe doctrines expressed in the Creeds must stand or fall by the test.\nConsider, for instance, the fundamental doctrine in the Creeds, that of\nthe Trinity, which has been much scoffed at. A belief in God, you will\nadmit, has an influence on conduct, and the Trinity defines the three\nchief aspects of the God in whom Christians believe. Of what use to\nquarrel with the word Person if God be conscious? And the character\nof God has an influence on conduct. The ancients deemed him wrathful,\njealous, arbitrary, and hence flung themselves before him and\npropitiated him. If the conscious God of the universe be good, he\nis spoken of as a Father. He is as once, in this belief, Father and\nCreator. And inasmuch as it is known that the divine qualities enter\ninto man, and that one Man, Jesus, whose composite portrait--it is\nagreed--could not have been factitiously invented, was filled with them,\nwe speak of God in man as the Son. And the Spirit of God that enters\ninto the soul of man, transforming, inspiring, and driving him, is the\nThird Person, so-called. There is no difficulty so far, granted the\ninitial belief in a beneficent God.\n\n\"If we agree that life has a meaning, and, in order to conform to the\npurpose of the Spirit of the Universe, must be lived in one way, we\ncertainly cannot object to calling that right way of living, that decree\nof the Spirit, the Word.\n\n\"The Incarnate Word, therefore, is the concrete example of a human being\ncompletely filled with the Spirit, who lives a perfect life according to\nits decree. Ancient Greek philosophy called this decree, this meaning of\nlife, the Logos, and the Nicene Creed is a confession of faith in that\nphilosophy. Although this creed is said to have been, scandalously\nforced through the council of Nicaea by an emperor who had murdered his\nwife and children, and who himself was unbaptized, against a majority\nof bishops who would, if they had dared Constantine's displeasure, have\ngiven the conscience freer play, to-day the difficulty has, practically\ndisappeared. The creed is there in the prayer book, and so long as it\nremains we are at liberty to interpret the ancient philosophy in which\nit is written--and which in any event could not have been greatly\nimproved upon at that time--in our own modern way, as I am trying to\nexplain it to you.\n\n\"Christ was identified with the Logos, or Word, which must have had a\nmeaning for all time, before and after its complete revelation.\nAnd this is what the Nicene Creed is trying to express when it says,\n'Begotten of his Father before all worlds.' In other words, the purpose\nwhich Christ revealed always existed. The awkward expression of\nthe ancients, declaring that he 'came down' for our salvation\n(enlightenment) contains a fact we may prove by experience, if we accept\nthe meaning he put upon existence, and adopt this meaning as our scheme\nof life. But we: must first be quite clear, as: to this meaning. We\nmay and do express all this differently, but it has a direct bearing\non life. It is the doctrine of the Incarnation. We begins to perceive\nthrough it that our own incarnations mean something, and that our task\nis to discover what they do mean--what part in the world purpose we are\ndesigned to play here.\n\n\"Incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary is an emphasis on the\nfact that man born of woman may be divine. But the ignorant masses of\nthe people of the Roman Empire were undoubtedly incapable of grasping a\ntheory of the Incarnation put forward in the terms of Greek philosophy;\nwhile it was easy for them, with their readiness to believe in nature\nmiracles, to accept the explanation of Christ's unique divinity as due\nto actual, physical generation by the Spirit. And the wide belief in the\nEmpire in gods born in this way aided such a conception. Many thousands\nwere converted to Christianity when a place was found in that religion\nfor a feminine goddess, and these abandoned the worship of Isis,\nDemeter, and Diana for that of the Virgin Mary. Thus began an evolution\nwhich is still going on, and we see now that it was impossible that the\nworld should understand at once the spiritual meaning of life as\nChrist taught it--that material facts merely symbolize the divine.\nFor instance, the Gospel of John has been called the philosophical or\nspiritual gospel. And in spite of the fact that it has been assailed\nand historically discredited by modern critics, for me it serves to\nilluminate certain truths of Christ's message and teaching that the\nother Gospels do not. Mark, the earliest Gospel, does not refer to the\nmiraculous birth. At the commencements of Matthew and Luke you will read\nof it, and it is to be noted that the rest of these narratives curiously\nand naively contradict it. Now why do we find the miraculous birth in\nthese Gospels if it had not been inserted in order to prove, in a\nmanner acceptable to simple and unlettered minds, the Theory of the\nIncarnation, Christ's preexistence? I do not say the insertion was\ndeliberate. And it is difficult for us moderns to realize the polemic\nspirit in which the Gospels were written. They were clearly not written\nas history. The concern of the authors, I think, was to convert their\nreaders to Christ.\n\n\"When we turn to John, what do we find? In the opening verses of this\nGospel the Incarnation is explained, not by a virgin birth, but in a\nmanner acceptable to the educated and spiritually-minded, in terms of\nthe philosophy of the day. And yet how simply! 'In the beginning was the\nWord, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.' I prefer John's\nexplanation.\n\n\"It is historically true that, in the earlier days when the Apostles'\nCreed was put forth, the phrase 'born of they Virgin Mary' was inserted\nfor the distinct purpose of laying stress on the humanity of Christ, and\nto controvert the assertion of the Gnostic sect that he was not born at\nall, but appeared in the world in some miraculous way.\n\n\"Thus to-day, by the aid of historical research, we are enabled to\nregard the Creeds in the light of their usefulness to life. The myth of\nthe virgin birth probably arose through the zeal of some of the writers\nof the Gospels to prove that the prophecy of Isaiah predicted the advent\nof the Jewish Messiah who should be born of a virgin. Modern scholars\nare agreed that the word Olmah which Isaiah uses does not mean virgin,\nbut young woman. There is quite a different Hebrew word for 'virgin.'\nThe Jews, at the time the Gospels were written, and before, had\nforgotten their ancient Hebrew. Knowing this mistake, and how it arose,\nwe may repeat the word Virgin Mary in the sense used by many early\nChristians, as designating the young woman who was the mother of Christ.\n\n\"I might mention one or two other phrases, archaic and obscure. 'The\nResurrection of the Body' may refer to the phenomenon of Christ's\nreappearance after death, for which modern psychology may or may not\naccount. A little reflection, however, convinces one that the phenomenon\ndid take place in some manner, or else, I think, we should never have\nheard of Christ. You will remember that the Apostles fled after his\ndeath on the cross, believing what he had told them was all only a\ndream. They were human, literal and cowardly, and they still needed some\nkind of inner, energizing conviction that the individuality persisted\nafter death, that the solution of human life was victory over it, in\norder to gain the courage to go out and preach the Gospel and face death\nthemselves. And it was Paul who was chiefly instrumental in freeing the\nmessage from the narrow bounds of Palestine and sending it ringing down\nthe ages to us. The miracle doesn't lie in what Paul saw, but in the\nwhole man transformed, made incandescent, journeying tirelessly to\nthe end of his days up and down the length and breadth of the empire,\nlabouring, as he says, more abundantly than they all. It is idle to say\nthat the thing which can transform a man's entire nature and life is not\na reality.\"\n\nShe had listened, motionless, as under the spell of his words.\nSelf-justification, as he proceeded, might easily have fused itself into\na desire to convince her of the truth of his beliefs. But he was not\ndeceived, he knew her well enough to understand, to feel the indomitable\nspirit of resistance in her. Swayed she could be, but she would mot\neasily surrender.\n\n\"There is another phrase,\" she said after a moment, \"which I have never\nheard explained, 'descended into hell.'\"\n\n\"It was merely a matter of controverting those who declared Christ was\ntaken from the cross before he died. In the childish science of the\ntime, to say that one descended into hell was to affirm that he was\nactually dead, since the souls of the departed were supposed to go at\nonce to hell. Hell and heaven were definite places. To say that Christ\nascended to heaven and sat on the right hand of the Father is to declare\none's faith that his responsible work in the spiritual realm continues.\"\n\n\"And the Atonement? doesn't that imply a sacrifice of propitiation?\"\n\n\"Atonement may be pronounced At-one-ment,\" Hodder replied. \"The old\nidea, illustrated by a reference to the sacrifice of the ancients, fails\nto convey the truth to modern minds. And moreover, as I have inferred,\nthese matters had to be conveyed in symbols until mankind were prepared\nto grasp the underlying spiritual truths which Christ sought to convey.\nOrthodox Christianity has been so profoundly affected by the ancient\nJewish religion that the conception of God as wrathful and jealous--a\nGod wholly outside--has persisted to our times. The Atonement means\nunion with the Spirit of the Universe through vicarious suffering, and\nexperience teaches us that our own sufferings are of no account unless\nthey be for a cause, for the furtherance of the design of the beneficent\nSpirit which is continually at work. Christ may be said to have died for\nhumanity because he had to suffer death itself in order to reveal\nthe complete meaning of life. You once spoke to me about the sense of\nsin--of being unable to feel it.\"\n\nShe glanced at him quickly, but did not speak.\n\n\"There is a theory concerning this,\" he continued, \"which has\nundoubtedly helped many people, and which may be found in the writings\nof certain modern psychologists. It is that we have a conscious, or\nlower, human self, and a subconscious, or better self. This subconscious\nself stretches down, as it were, into the depths of the universe and\ntaps the source of spiritual power. And it is through the subconscious\nself that every man is potentially divine. Potentially, because the\nconscious self has to reach out by an effort of the will to effect this\nunion with the spiritual in the subconscious, and when it is effected,\nit comes from the response of the subconscious. Apparently from without,\nas a gift, and therefore, in theological language, it is called grace.\nThis is what is meant by being born again, the incarnation of the Spirit\nin the conscious, or human. The two selves are no longer divided, and\nthe higher self assumes control,--takes the reins, so to speak.\n\n\"It is interesting, as a theory. And the fact that it has been seriously\ncombated by writers who deny such a function of the subconscious does\nnot at all affect the reality of the experience.\n\n\"Once we have had a vision of the true meaning of life a vision which\nstirs the energies of our being, what is called 'a sense of sin'\ninevitably follows. It is the discontent, the regret, in the light of a\nhigher knowledge, for the lost opportunities, for a past life which\nhas been uncontrolled by any unifying purpose, misspent in futile\nundertakings, wasted, perhaps, in follies and selfish caprices which\nhave not only harmed ourselves but others. Although we struggle, yet\nby habit, by self-indulgence, by lack of a sustained purpose, we have\nformed a character from which escape seems hopeless. And we realize\nthat in order to change ourselves, an actual regeneration of the will is\nnecessary. For awhile, perchance, we despair of this. The effort to get\nout of the rut we have made for ourselves seems of no avail. And it\nis not, indeed, until we arrive, gradually or otherwise, and through a\nproper interpretation of the life of Christ, at the conviction that we\nmay even never become useful in the divine scheme that we have a sense\nof what is called 'the forgiveness of sins.' This conviction, this\ngrace, this faith to embark on the experiment accomplishes of itself\nthe revival of the will, the rebirth which we had thought impossible. We\ndiscover our task, high or humble,--our cause. We grow marvellously at\none with God's purpose, and we feel that our will is acting in the same\ndirection as his. And through our own atonement we see the meaning of\nthat other Atonement which led Christ to the Cross. We see that our\nconviction, our grace, has come through him, and how he died for our\nsins.\"\n\n\"It's quite wonderful how logical and simple you make it, how thoroughly\nyou have gone into it. You have solved it for yourself--and you will\nsolve it for others many others.\"\n\nShe rose, and he, too, got to his feet with a medley of feelings. The\npath along which they walked was already littered with green acorns.\nA gray squirrel darted ahead of them, gained a walnut and paused,\nquivering, halfway up the trunk, to gaze back at them. And the glance\nshe presently gave him seemed to partake of the shyness of the wild\nthing.\n\n\"Thank you for explaining it to me,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope you don't think--\" he began.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't that!\" she cried, with unmistakable reproach. \"I\nasked you--I made you tell me. It hasn't seemed at all like--the\nconfessional,\" she added, and smiled and blushed at the word. \"You have\nput it so nicely, so naturally, and you have given me so much to think\nabout. But it all depends--doesn't it?--upon whether one can feel the\nunderlying truth of which you spoke in the first place; it rests upon\na sense of the prevailing goodness of things. It seems to me cruel that\nwhat is called salvation, the solution of the problem of life, should\ndepend upon an accidental discovery. We are all turned loose with our\nanimal passions and instincts, of self-preservation, by an indifferent\nCreator, in a wilderness, and left to find our way out as best we can.\nYou answer that Christ showed us the way. There are elements in his\nteaching I cannot accept--perhaps because I have been given a wrong\ninterpretation of them. I shall ask you more questions some day.\n\n\"But even then,\" she continued, \"granted that Christ brought the\ncomplete solution, as you say, why should so many millions have lived\nand died, before and after his coming, who had suffered so, and who had\nnever heard of him? That is the way my reason works, and I can't help\nit. I would help it if I could.\"\n\n\"Isn't it enough,\" he asked, \"to know that a force is at work combating\nevil,--even if you are not yet convinced that it is a prevailing force?\nCan you not trust that it will be a prevailing force, if your sympathies\nare with it, without demanding a revelation of the entire scheme of the\nuniverse? Of what use is it to doubt the eternal justice?\"\n\n\"Oh, use!\" she cried, \"I grant you its uselessness. Doubt seems an\ningrained quality. I can't help being a fatalist.\"\n\n\"And yet you have taken your life in your own hands,\" he reminded her,\ngently.\n\n\"Only to be convinced of its futility,\" she replied.\n\nAgain, momentarily thrust back into himself, he wondered jealously once\nmore what the disillusionments had been of that experience from before\nwhich she seemed, at times, ready to draw back a little the veil.\n\n\"A sense of futility is a sense of incompleteness,\" he said, \"and\ngenerally precedes a sense of power.\"\n\n\"Ah, you have gained that! Yet it must always have been latent in\nyou--you make one feel it. But now!\" she exclaimed, as though the\ndiscovery had just dawned on her, \"now you will need power, now you will\nhave to fight as you have never fought in your life.\"\n\nHe found her enthusiasm as difficult to withstand as her stoicism.\n\n\"Yes, I shall have to fight,\" he admitted. Her partisanship was sweet.\n\n\"When you tell them what you have told me,\" she continued, as though\nworking it out in her own mind, \"they will never submit to it, if they\ncan help it. My father will never submit to it. They will try to put you\nout, as a heretic,--won't they?\"\n\n\"I have an idea that they will,\" he conceded, with a smile.\n\n\"And won't they succeed? Haven't they the power?\"\n\n\"It depends,--in the first place, on whether the bishop thinks me a\nheretic.\"\n\n\"Have you asked him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But can't they make you resign?\"\n\n\"They can deprive me of my salary.\"\n\nShe did not press this.\n\n\"You mustn't think me a martyr,\" he pleaded, in a lighter tone.\n\nShe paid no heed to this protest, but continued to regard him with a\nface lighted by enthusiasm.\n\n\"Oh, that's splendid of you!\" she cried. \"You are going to speak\nthe truth as you see it, and let them do their worst. Of course,\nfundamentally, it isn't merely because they're orthodox that they won't\nlike it, although they'll say so, and perhaps think so. It will be\nbecause if you have really found the truth--they will instinctively,\nfear its release. For it has a social bearing, too--hasn't it?--although\nyou haven't explained that part of it.\"\n\n\"It has a distinct social bearing,\" he replied, amazed at the way her\nmind flew forward and grasped the entire issue, in spite of the fact\nthat her honesty still refused to concede his premises. Such were the\ncontradictions in her that he loved. And, though she did not suspect it,\nshe had in her the Crusader's spirit. \"I have always remembered what\nyou once said, that many who believed themselves Christians had an\ninstinctive feeling that there is a spark in Christianity which, if\nallowed to fly, would start a conflagration beyond their control.\nAnd that they had covered the spark with ashes. I, too,\" he added\nwhimsically, \"was buried under the ashes.\"\n\n\"And the spark,\" she demanded, \"is not Socialism--their nightmare?\"\n\n\"The spark is Christianity itself--but I am afraid they will not be able\nto distinguish it from Socialism. The central paradox in Christianity\nconsists in the harmonizing of the individual and socialistic spirit,\nand this removes it as far from the present political doctrine of\nsocialism as it is possible to be. Christianity, looked at from a\ncertain viewpoint,--and I think the proper viewpoint,--is the most\nindividualistic of religions, since its basic principle is the\ndevelopment of the individual into an autonomous being.\"\n\nThey stood facing each other on an open stretch of lawn. The place was\ndeserted. Through the trees, in the near distance, the sightless front\nof the Ferguson mansion blazed under the September sun.\n\n\"Individualistic!\" she repeated, as though dazed by the word applied to\nthe religion she had discarded. \"I can't understand. Do you think I ever\ncan understand?\" she asked him, simply.\n\n\"It seems to me you understand more than you are willing to give\nyourself credit for,\" he answered seriously. \"You don't take into\naccount your attitude.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean--a willingness to take the right road, if I can\nfind it. I am not at all sure that I want to take it. But you must tell\nme more--more of what you have discovered. Will you?\"\n\nHe just hesitated. She herself appeared to acknowledge no bar to their\nfurther intimacy--why should he?\n\n\"I will tell you all I know,\" he said.\n\nSuddenly, as if by a transference of thought, she voiced what he had in\nmind.\n\n\"You are going to tell them the truth about themselves!\" she exclaimed.\n\"--That they are not Christians!\"\n\nHis silence was an admission.\n\n\"You must see,\" he told her, after the moment they had looked into each\nother's faces, \"that this is the main reason why I must stay at St.\nJohn's, in the Church, if I conscientiously can.\"\n\n\"I see. The easier course would be to resign, to have scruples. And you\nbelieve there is a future for the Church.\"\n\n\"I believe it,\" he assented.\n\nShe still held his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, it is worth doing. If you see it that way it is more worth\ndoing than anything else. Please don't think,\" she said, \"that I don't\nappreciate why you have told me all this, why you have given me your\nreasons. I know it hasn't been easy. It's because you wish me to have\nfaith in you for my own sake, not for yours. And I am grateful.\"\n\n\"And if that faith is justified, as you will help to justify it, that it\nmay be transferred to a larger sphere,\" he answered.\n\nShe gave him her hand, but did not reply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. MR. GOODRICH BECOMES A PARTISAN\n\n\n\nI\n\nIn these days of his preparation, she haunted him continually. In her\nhe saw typified all those who possessed the divine discontent, the\nyearning unsatisfied,--the fatalists and the dreamers. And yet she\nseemed to have risen through instinct to share the fire of his vision\nof religion revealed to the countless ranks of strugglers as the hidden\nmotive-power of the world, the impetus of scientist, statesman, artist,\nand philanthropist! They had stood together on the heights of the larger\nview, whence the whole of the battle-line lay disclosed.\n\nAt other and more poignant moments he saw her as waving him bravely on\nwhile he steamed out through towering seas to safety. The impression\nwas that of smiling at her destiny. Had she fixed upon it? and did\nshe linger now only that she might inspire him in his charge? She was\ncapable, he knew, of taking calmly the irrevocable step, of accepting\nthe decree as she read it. The thought tortured, the desire to save her\nfrom herself obsessed him; with true clairvoyance she had divined him\naright when she had said that he wished her to have faith in him for her\nown sake. Could he save her in spite of herself? and how? He could not\nsee her, except by chance. Was she waiting until he should have crossed\nthe bar before she should pay some inexorable penalty of which he knew\nnothing?\n\nThus he speculated, suffered, was at once cast down and lifted up by\nthe thought of her. To him, at least, she was one of those rare and\ndauntless women, the red stars of history, by whom the Dantes and\nLeonardos are fired to express the inexpressible, and common clay is\nfused and made mad: one of those women who, the more they reveal, become\nthe more inscrutable. Divinely inarticulate, he called her; arousing the\npassion of the man, yet stirring the sublimer efforts of the god.\n\nWhat her feelings toward him, whether she loved him as a woman loves a\nman he could not say, no man being a judge in the supreme instance. She\nbeheld him emancipated, perhaps, from what she might have called the\nfetters of an orthodoxy for which she felt an instinctive antagonism;\nbut whether, though proclaiming himself free, the fact of his\ncontinuation in the ministry would not of itself set up in her a\nreaction, he was unable to predict. Her antipathy to forms, he saw,\nwas inherent. Her interest--her fascinated absorption, it might be\ncalled--in his struggle was spiritual, indeed, but it also had mixed\nin it the individualistic zeal of the nonconformist. She resented the\ntrammels of society; though she suffered from her efforts to transcend\nthem. The course he had determined upon appeared to her as a rebellion\nnot only against a cut-and-dried state of mind, but also against vested\nprivilege. Yet she had in her, as she confessed, the craving for what\nprivilege brings in the way of harmonious surroundings. He loved her for\nher contradictions.\n\nThus he was utterly unable to see what the future held for him in the\nway of continued communion with her, to evolve any satisfactory theory\nas to why she remained in the city. She had told him that the gardens\nwere an excuse. She had come, by her own intimation, to reflect, to\ndecide some momentous question. Marriage? He found this too agitating to\ndwell upon, summoning, as it did, conjectures of the men she might have\nknown; and it was perhaps natural, in view of her attitude, that he\ncould only think of such a decision on her part as surrender.\n\nThat he had caught and held her attention, although by no conscious\neffort of his own, was clear to him. But had he not merely arrested her?\nWould she not presently disappear, leaving only in his life the scarlet\nthread which she had woven into it for all time? Would he not fail to\nchange, permanently, the texture of hers?\n\nSuch were his hopes and fears concerning her, and they were mingled\ninextricably with other hopes and fears which had to do with the great\nventure of his life. He dwelt in a realm of paradoxes, discovered\nthat exaltation was not incompatible with anxiety and dread. He had\nno thought of wavering; he had achieved to an extent he would not\nhave believed possible the sense of consecration which brings with\nit indifference to personal fortunes, and the revelation of the inner\nworld, and yet he shrank from the wounds he was about to receive--and\ngive. Outwardly controlled, he lived in the state of intense excitement\nof the leader waiting for the time to charge.\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe moment was at hand. September had waned, the nights were cooling,\nhis parishioners were returning from the East. One of these was Eleanor\nGoodrich, whom he met on a corner, tanned and revived from her long\nsummer in Massachusetts. She had inherited the kindly shrewdness of\nglance characteristic of gentlefolk, the glance that seeks to\npenetrate externals in its concern for the well-being of those whom it\nscrutinizes. And he was subtly aware, though she greeted him cordially,\nthat she felt a change in him without being able to account for it.\n\n\"I hear you have been here all summer,\" she said reproachfully. \"Mother\nand father and all of us were much disappointed that you did not come to\nus on the Cape.\"\n\n\"I should have come, if it had been possible,\" he replied. \"It seems to\nhave done you a world of good.\"\n\n\"Oh, I!\" She seemed slightly embarrassed, puzzled, and did not look at\nhim. \"I am burned as disgracefully as Evelyn. Phil came on for a month.\n\n\"He tells me he hasn't seen you, but that isn't surprising, for he\nhasn't been to church since June--and he's a vestryman now, too.\"\n\nShe was in mourning for her father-in-law, who had died in the spring.\nPhil Goodrich had taken his place. Eleanor found the conversation,\nsomehow, drifting out of her control. It was not at all what she would\nhave desired to say. Her colour heightened.\n\n\"I have not been conducting the services, but I resume them next\nSunday,\" said the rector. \"I ought to tell you,\" he went on, regarding\nher, \"in view of the conversation we have had, that I have changed my\nmind concerning a great many things we have talked about--although\nI have not spoken of this as yet to any of the members of the\ncongregation.\"\n\nShe was speechless, and could only stare at him blankly.\n\n\"I mean,\" he continued, with a calmness that astonished her afterwards,\n\"that I have changed my whole conception as to the functions and future\nof the Church, that I have come to your position, that we must make up\nour minds for ourselves, and not have them made up for us. And that\nwe must examine into the truth of all statements, and be governed\naccordingly.\"\n\nHer attitude was one of mingled admiration, concern, and awe. And he saw\nthat she had grasped something of the complications which his course was\nlikely to bring about.\n\n\"But you are not going to leave us!\" she managed to exclaim.\n\n\"Not if it is possible to remain,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\"I am so glad.\" She was still overpowered by the disclosure. \"It is good\nof you to tell me. Do you mind my telling Phil?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" he assured her.\n\n\"Will you forgive me,\" she asked, after a slight pause during which she\nhad somewhat regained her composure, \"if I say that I always thought,\nor rather hoped you would change? that your former beliefs seemed\nso--unlike you?\"\n\nHe continued to smile at her as she stepped forward to take the car.\n\n\"I'll have to forgive you,\" he answered, \"because you were right--\"\n\nShe was still in such a state of excitement when she arrived down town\nthat she went direct to her husband's law office.\n\n\"I like this!\" he exclaimed, as, unannounced, she opened the door of\nhis sanctuary. \"You might have caught me with one of those good-looking\nclients of mine.\"\n\n\"Oh, Phil!\" she cried, \"I've got such a piece of news, I couldn't resist\ncoming to tell you. I met Mr. Hodder--and he's changed.\"\n\n\"Changed!\" Phil repeated, looking up at her flushed face beside him.\nInstead of a law-book, he flung down a time table in which he had been\ninvestigating the trains to a quail shooting club in the southern part\nof the state: The transition to Mr. Hodder was, therefore, somewhat\nabrupt. \"Why, Nell, to look at you, I thought it could be nothing else\nthan my somewhat belated appointment to the United States Supreme Court.\nHow has Hodder changed? I always thought him pretty decent.\"\n\n\"Don't laugh at me,\" she begged, \"it's really serious--and no one knows\nit yet. He said I might tell you. Do you remember that talk we had\nat father's, when he first came, and we likened him to a modern\nSavonarola?\"\n\n\"And George Bridges took the floor, and shocked mother and Lucy and\nLaureston,\" supplied Phil.\n\n\"I don't believe mother really was as much shocked as she appeared to\nbe,\" said Eleanor. \"At any rate, the thing that had struck us--you and\nme--was that Mr. Hodder looked as though he could say something helpful,\nif he only would. And then I went to see him afterwards, in the parish\nhouse--you remember?--after we had been reading modern criticism\ntogether, and he told me that the faith which had come down from\nthe fathers was like an egg? It couldn't be chipped. I was awfully\ndisappointed--and yet I couldn't help liking him, he was so honest. And\nthe theological books he gave me to read--which were so mediaeval and\nabsurd! Well, he has come around to our point of view. He told me so\nhimself.\"\n\n\"But what is our point of view, Nell?\" her husband asked, with a smile.\n\"Isn't it a good deal like Professor Bridges', only we're not quite\nso learned? We're just ordinary heathens, as far as I can make out. If\nHodder has our point of view, he ought to go into the law or a trust\ncompany.\"\n\n\"Oh, Phil!\" she protested, \"and you're on the vestry! I do believe in\nSomething, and so do you.\"\n\n\"Something,\" he observed, \"is hardly a concrete and complete theology.\"\n\n\"Why do you make me laugh,\" she reproached him, \"when the matter is so\nserious? What I'm trying to tell you is that I'm sure Mr. Hodder has\nworked it out. He's too sincere to remain in the Church and not have\nsomething constructive and satisfying. I've always said that he seemed\nto have a truth shut up inside of him which he could not communicate.\nWell, now he looks as though he were about to communicate it, as though\nhe had discovered it. I suppose you think me silly, but you'll grant,\nwhatever Mr. Hodder may be, he isn't silly. And women can feel these\nthings. You know I'm not given to sentimentality, but I was never so\nimpressed by the growth in any personality as I was this morning by his.\nHe seems to have become himself, as I always imagined him. And, Phil, he\nwas so fine! He's absolutely incapable of posing, as you'll admit, and\nhe stood right up and acknowledged that he'd been wrong in our argument.\nHe hasn't had the services all summer, and when he resumes them next\nSunday I gathered that he intends to make his new position clear.\"\n\nMr. Goodrich thrust his hands in his pockets and gave a low whistle.\n\n\"I guess I won't go shooting Saturday, after all,\" he declared. \"I\nwouldn't miss Hodder's sermon for all the quail in Harrington County.\"\n\n\"It's high time you did go to church,\" remarked Eleanor, contemplating,\nnot without pride, her husband's close-cropped, pugnacious head.\n\n\"Your judgments are pretty sound, Nell. I'll do you that credit. And I've\nalways owned up that Hodder would be a fighter if he ever got started.\nIt's written all over him. What's more, I've a notion that some of our\nfriends are already a little suspicious of him.\"\n\n\"You mean Mr. Parr?\" she asked, anxiously.\n\n\"No, Wallis Plimpton.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, with disdain in her voice.\n\n\"Mr. Parr only got back yesterday, and Wallis told me that Hodder had\nrefused to go on a yachting trip with him. Not only foolishness, but\nhigh treason.\" Phil smiled. \"Plimpton's the weather-vane, the barometer\nof that crowd--he feels a disturbance long before it turns up--he's as\nsensitive as the stock market.\"\n\n\"He is the stock market,\" said Eleanor.\n\n\"It's been my opinion,\" Phil went on reflectively, \"that they've all had\njust a trace of uneasiness about Hodder all along, an idea that Nelson\nLangmaid slipped up for the first time in his life when he got him to\ncome. Oh, the feeling's been dormant, but it existed. And they've been\njust a little afraid that they couldn't handle him if the time ever\ncame. He's not their type. When I saw Plimpton at the Country Club the\nother day he wondered, in that genial, off-hand manner of his, whether\nHodder would continue to be satisfied with St. John's. Plimpton said he\nmight be offered a missionary diocese. Oh we'll have a fine old row.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" said Eleanor, \"that that's the only thing that interests\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well, it does please me,\" he admitted, \"when I think of Gordon Atterbury\nand Everett Constable and a few others,--Eldon Parr,--who believe that\nreligion ought to be kept archaic and innocuous, served in a form that\nwon't bother anybody. By the way, Nell, do you remember the verse the\nProfessor quoted about the Pharisees, and cleansing the outside of the\ncup and platter?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, \"why?\"\n\n\"Well--Hodder didn't give you any intimation as to what he intended to\ndo about that sort of thing, did he?\"\n\n\"What sort of thing?\"\n\n\"About the inside of Eldon Parr's cup,--so to speak. And the inside of\nWallis Plimpton's cup, and Everett Constable's cup, and Ferguson's cup,\nand Langmaid's. Did it ever strike you that, in St. John's, we have the\nsublime spectacle of Eldon Parr, the Pharisee in chief, conducting the\nChurch of Christ, who, uttered that denunciation? That's what George\nBridges meant. There's something rather ironical in such a situation, to\nsay the least.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Eleanor, thoughtfully.\n\n\"And what's more, it's typical,\" continued Phil, energetically, \"the big\nBaptist church on the Boulevard is run by old Sedges, as canny a rascal\nas you could find in the state. The inside of has cup has never been\ntouched, though he was once immersed in the Mississippi, they say, and\nswallowed a lot of water.\"\n\n\"Oh, Phil!\"\n\n\"Hodder's been pretty intimate with Eldon Parr--that always puzzled me,\"\nPhil went on. \"And yet I'm like you, I never doubted Hodder's honesty.\nI've always been curious to know what would happen when he found out the\nkind of thing Eldon Parr is doing every day in his life, making people\nstand and deliver in the interest of what he would call National\nProsperity. Why, that fellow, Funk, they sent to the penitentiary the\nother day for breaking into the Addicks' house isn't a circumstance to\nEldon Parr. He's robbed his tens of thousands, and goes on robbing them\nright along. By the way, Mr. Parr took most of Addicks' money before\nFunk got his silver.\"\n\n\"Phil, you have such a ridiculous way of putting things! But I suppose\nit's true.\"\n\n\"True! I should say it was! There was Mr. Bentley--that was mild. And\nthere never was a hold-up of a western express that could compare to the\nConsolidated Tractions. Some of these big fellows have the same kind\nof brain as the professional thieves. Well, they are professional\nthieves--what's the use of mincing matters! They never try the same game\ntwice. Mr. Parr's getting ready to make another big haul right now. I\nknow, because Plimpton said as much, although he didn't confide in\nme what this particular piece of rascality is. He knows better.\" Phil\nGoodrich looked grim.\n\n\"But the law?\" exclaimed his wife.\n\n\"There never was a law that Nelson Langmaid couldn't drive a horse and\ncarriage through.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Langmaid's one of the nicest men I know!\"\n\n\"What I wonder,\" mused Phil, \"is whether this is a mere doctrinal revolt\non Hodder's part, or whether he has found out a few things. There are\nso many parsons in these days who don't seem to see any inconsistency\nin robbing several thousand people to build settlement houses and\ncarved marble altars, and who wouldn't accept a Christmas box from a\nhighwayman. But I'll do Hodder the justice to say he doesn't strike me\nas that kind. And I have an idea that Eldon Parr and Wallis Plimpton\nand the rest know he isn't, know that he'd be a Tartar if he ever get\nstarted, and that's what makes them uneasy.\"\n\n\"Then it isn't his change of religious opinions they would care about?\"\nsaid Eleanor.\n\n\"Oh, I don't say that Eldon Parr won't try to throw him out if he\nquestions the faith as delivered by the Saints.\"\n\n\"Phil, what a way of putting it!\"\n\n\"Any indication of independence, any approach to truth would be regarded\nas dangerous,\" Phil continued. \"And of course Gordon Atterbury and others\nwe could mention, who think they believe in the unchipped egg theory,\nwill be outraged. But it's deeper than that. Eldon Parr will give orders\nthat Hodder's to go.\"\n\n\"Give orders?\"\n\n\"Certainly. That vestry, so far as Mr. Parr is concerned, is a mere\ndummy board of directors. He's made Langmaid, and Plimpton, and even\nEverett Constable, who's the son of an honourable gentleman, and ought\nto know better. And he can ruin them by snapping his fingers. He can\neven make the financial world too hot for Ferguson. I'll say this\nfor Gordon Atterbury, that Mr. Parr can't control him, but he's got a\nmajority without him, and Gordon won't vote for a heretic. Who are left,\nexcept father-in-law Waring and myself?\"\n\n\"He can't control either of you!\" said Eleanor, proudly.\n\n\"When it comes to that, Nell--we'll move into Canada and buy a farm.\"\n\n\"But can he hurt you, Phil--either of you?\" she asked, after a moment.\n\n\"I'd like to see him try it,\" Phil Goodrich declared\n\nAnd his wife thought, as she looked at him, that she would like to see\nMr. Parr try it, too.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nPhil Goodrich had once said that Mr. Plimpton's translation of the\nnational motto E pluribus unum, was \"get together,\" and it was true that\nnot the least of Mr. Plimpton's many gifts was that of peace making.\nSuch was his genius that he scented trouble before it became manifest\nto the world, and he stoutly declared that no difference of opinion ever\nexisted between reasonable men that might not be patched up before the\nbreach became too wide--provided that a third reasonable man contributed\nhis services. The qualifying word \"reasonable\" is to be noted. When Mr.\nBedloe Hubbell had undertaken, in the name of Reform, to make a witch's\ncauldron of the city's politics, which Mr. Beatty had hitherto\nconducted so smoothly from the back room of his saloon, Mr. Plimpton had\nunselfishly offered his services. Bedloe Hubbell, although he had been a\nplaymate of Mr. Plimpton's wife's, had not proved \"reasonable,\" and had\nrejected with a scorn only to be deemed fanatical the suggestion that\nMr. Hubbell's interests and Mr. Beatty's interests need not clash, since\nMr. Hubbell might go to Congress! And Mr. Plimpton was the more hurt\nsince the happy suggestion was his own, and he had had no little\ndifficulty in getting Mr. Beatty to agree to it.\n\nYet Mr. Plimpton's career in the ennobling role of peacemaker had, on\nthe whole, been crowned with such success as to warrant his belief in\nthe principle. Mr. Parr, for instance,--in whose service, as in that\nof any other friend, Mr. Plimpton was always ready to act--had had\nmisunderstandings with eminent financiers, and sometimes with United\nStates Senators. Mr. Plimpton had made many trips to the Capitol at\nWashington, sometimes in company with Mr. Langmaid, sometimes not, and\non one memorable occasion had come away smiling from an interview with\nthe occupant of the White House himself.\n\nLest Mr. Plimpton's powers of premonition seem supernatural, it may\nbe well to reveal the comparative simplicity of his methods. Genius,\nanalyzed, is often disappointing, Mr. Plimpton's was selective and\nsynthetic. To illustrate in a particular case, he had met Mr. Parr\nin New York and had learned that the Reverend Mr. Hodder had not only\ndeclined to accompany the banker on a yachting trip, but had elected to\nremain in the city all summer, in his rooms in the parish house, while\nconducting no services. Mr. Parr had thought this peculiar. On his\nreturn home Mr. Plimpton had one day dropped in to see a Mr. Gaines,\nthe real estate agent for some of his property. And Mr. Plimpton being\nhale-fellow-well-met, Mr. Gaines had warned him jestingly that he\nwould better not let his parson know that he owned a half interest in a\ncertain hotel in Dalton Street, which was leased at a profitable rate.\n\nIf Mr. Plimpton felt any uneasiness, he did not betray it. And he\nmanaged to elicit from the agent, in an entirely casual and jovial\nmanner, the fact that Mr. Hodder, a month or so before, had settled\nthe rent of a woman for a Dalton Street flat, and had been curious to\ndiscover the name of the owner. Mr. Gaines, whose business it was to\nrecognize everybody, was sure of Mr. Hodder, although he had not worn\nclerical clothes.\n\nMr. Plimpton became very thoughtful when he had left the office. He\nvisited Nelson Langmaid in the Parr Building. And the result of the\nconference was to cause Mr. Langmaid to recall, with a twinge of\nuneasiness, a certain autumn morning in a room beside Bremerton Lake\nwhen he had been faintly yet distinctly conscious of the admonitory\nwhisperings of that sixth sense which had saved him on other occasions.\n\n\"Dash it!\" he said to himself, after Mr. Plimpton had departed, and\nhe stood in the window and gazed across at the flag on the roof of\n'Ferguson's.' \"It would serve me right for meddling in this parson\nbusiness. Why did I take him away from Jerry Whitely, anyhow?\"\n\nIt added to Nelson Langmaid's discomfort that he had a genuine\naffection, even an admiration for the parson in question. He might have\nknown by looking at the man that he would wake up some day,--such was\nthe burden of his lament. And there came to him, ironically out of\nthe past, the very words of Mr. Parr's speech to the vestry after Dr.\nGilman's death, that succinct list of qualifications for a new rector\nwhich he himself, Nelson Langmaid, had humorously and even more\nsuccinctly epitomized. Their \"responsibility to the parish, to the city,\nand to God\" had been to find a rector \"neither too old nor too young,\nwho would preach the faith as we received it, who was not sensational,\nand who did not mistake Socialism for Christianity.\" At the \"Socialism\"\na certain sickly feeling possessed the lawyer, and he wiped beads of\nperspiration from his dome-like forehead.\n\nHe didn't pretend to be versed in theology--so he had declared--and at\nthe memory of these words of his the epithet \"ass,\" self applied, passed\nhis lips. \"You want a parson who will stick to his last, not too high or\ntoo low or too broad or too narrow, who has intellect without too\nmuch initiative... and will not get the church uncomfortably full\nof strangers and run you out of your pews.\" Thus he had capped the\nfinancier. Well, if they had caught a tartar, it served him, Nelson\nLangmaid, right. He recalled his talk with Gerald Whitely, and how his\nbrother-in-law had lost his temper when they had got on the subject of\npersonality....\n\nPerhaps Wallis Plimpton could do something. Langmaid's hopes of this\nwere not high. It may have been that he had suspicions of what Mr.\nPlimpton would have called Hodder's \"reasonableness.\" One thing was\nclear--that Mr. Plimpton was frightened. In the sanctuaries, the private\nconfessionals of high finance (and Nelson Langmaid's office may be\ncalled so), the more primitive emotions are sometimes exhibited.\n\n\"I don't see what business it is of a clergyman, or of any one else,\nwhether I own property in Dalton Street,\" Mr. Plimpton had said, as he\nsat on the edge of the lawyer's polished mahogany desk. \"What does he\nexpect us to do,--allow our real estate to remain unproductive merely\nfor sentimental reasons? That's like a parson, most of 'em haven't got\nany more common sense than that. What right has he got to go nosing\naround Dalton Street? Why doesn't he stick to his church?\"\n\n\"I thought you fellows were to build him a settlement house there,\"\nLangmaid observed.\n\n\"On the condition that he wouldn't turn socialist.\"\n\n\"You'd better have stipulated it in the bond,\" said the lawyer, who\ncould not refrain, even at this solemn moment, from the temptation of\nplaying upon Mr. Plimpton's apprehensions. \"I'm afraid he'll make it his\nbusiness, Wallis, to find out whether you own anything in Dalton Street.\nI'll bet he's got a list of Dalton Street property in his pocket right\nnow.\"\n\nMr. Plimpton groaned.\n\n\"Thank God I don't own any of it!\" said Langmaid.\n\n\"What the deuce does he intend to do?\" the other demanded.\n\n\"Read it out in church,\" Langmaid suggested. \"It wouldn't sound pretty,\nWallis, to be advertised in the post on Monday morning as owning that\nkind of a hotel.\"\n\n\"Oh, he's a gentleman,\" said Mr. Plimpton, \"he wouldn't do anything as\nlow as that!\"\n\n\"But if he's become a socialist?\" objected Langmaid.\n\n\"He wouldn't do it,\" his friend reiterated, none too confidently. \"I\nshouldn't be surprised if he made me resign from the vestry and forced\nme to sell my interest. It nets me five thousand a year.\"\n\n\"What is the place?\" Langmaid asked sympathetically, \"Harrod's?\"\n\nMr. Plimpton nodded.\n\n\"Not that I am a patron,\" the lawyer explained somewhat hastily. \"But\nI've seen the building, going home.\"\n\n\"It looks to me as if it would burn down some day, Wallis.\"\n\n\"I wish it would,\" said Mr. Plimpton.\n\n\"If it's any comfort to you--to us,\" Langmaid went on, after a moment,\n\"Eldon Parr owns the whole block above Thirteenth, on the south\nside--bought it three years ago. He thinks the business section will\ngrow that way.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Mr. Plimpton, and they looked at each other.\n\nThe name predominant in both minds had been mentioned.\n\n\"I wonder if Hodder really knows what he's up against.\" Mr. Plimpton\nsometimes took refuge in slang.\n\n\"Well, after all, we're not sure yet that he's 'up against anything,'\"\nreplied Langmaid, who thought the time had come for comfort. \"It may\nall be a false alarm. There's no reason, after all, why a Christian\nclergyman shouldn't rescue women in Dalton Street, and remain in the\ncity to study the conditions of the neighbourhood where his settlement\nhouse is to be. And just, because you or I would not be able to resist\nan invitation to go yachting with Eldon Parr, a man might be imagined\nwho had that amount of moral courage.\"\n\n\"That's just it. Hodder seems to me, now I come to think of it, just\nthe kind of John Brown type who wouldn't hesitate to get into a row\nwith Eldon Parr if he thought it was right, and pull down any amount of\ndisagreeable stuff about our ears.\"\n\n\"You're mixing your heroes, Wallis,\" said Langmaid.\n\n\"I can't help it. You'd catch it, too, Nelson. What in the name of sense\npossessed you to get such a man?\"\n\nThis being a question the lawyer was unable to answer, the conversation\ncame to another pause. And it was then that Mr. Plimpton's natural\noptimism reasserted itself.\n\n\"It isn't done,--the thing we're afraid of, that's all,\" he proclaimed,\nafter a turn or two about the room. \"Hodder's a gentleman, as I said,\nand if he feels as we suspect he does he'll resign like a gentleman and\na Christian. I'll have a talk with him--oh, you can trust me! I've got\nan idea. Gordon Atterbury told me the other day there is a vacancy in a\nmissionary diocese out west, and that Hodder's name had been mentioned,\namong others, to the bishops for the place. He'd make a rattling\nmissionary bishop, you know, holding services in saloons and knocking\nmen's heads together for profanity, and he boxes like a professional.\nNow, a word from Eldon Parr might turn the trick. Every parson wants to\nbe a bishop.\"\n\nLangmaid shook his head.\n\n\"You're getting out of your depths, my friend. The Church isn't\nWall Street. And missionary bishops aren't chosen to make convenient\nvacancies.\"\n\n\"I don't mean anything crude,\" Mr. Plimpton protested. \"But a word\nfrom the chief layman of a diocese like this, a man who never misses\na General Convention, and does everything handsomely, might\ncount,--particularly if they're already thinking of Hodder. The bishops\nwould never suspect we wanted to get rid of him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Langmaid, \"I advise you to go easy, all along the line.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll go easy enough,\" Mr. Plimpton assented, smiling. \"Do you\nremember how I pulled off old Senator Matthews when everybody swore he\nwas dead set on voting for an investigation in the matter of those coal\nlands Mr. Parr got hold of in his state?\"\n\n\"Matthews isn't Hodder, by a long shat,\" said Langmaid. \"If you ask me\nmy opinion, I'll tell you frankly that if Hodder has made up his mind\nto stay in St. John's a ton of dynamite and all the Eldon Parrs in the\nnation can't get him out.\"\n\n\"Can't the vestry make him resign?\" asked Mr. Plimpton, uncomfortably.\n\n\"You'd better, go home and study your canons, my friend. Nothing short\nof conviction for heresy can do it, if he doesn't want to go.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't exactly call him a heretic,\" Mr. Plimpton said ruefully.\n\n\"Would you know a heretic if you saw one?\" demanded Langmaid.\n\n\"No, but my wife would, and Gordon Atterbury and Constable would, and\nEldon Parr. But don't let's get nervous.\"\n\n\"Well, that's sensible at any rate,\" said Langmaid....\n\nSo Mr. Plimpton had gone off optimistic, and felt even more so the next\nmorning after he had had his breakfast in the pleasant dining room of\nthe Gore Mansion, of which he was now master. As he looked out through\nthe open window at the sunshine in the foliage of Waverley Place,\nthe prospect of his being removed from that position of dignity and\ninfluence on the vestry of St. John's, which he had achieved, with\nothers, after so much walking around the walls, seemed remote. And he\nreflected with satisfaction upon the fact that his wife, who was his\nprime minister, would be home from the East that day. Two heads were\nbetter than one, especially if one of the two were Charlotte Gore's.\nAnd Mr. Plimpton had often reflected upon the loss to the world, and the\ngain to himself, that she was a woman.\n\nIt would not be gallant to suggest that his swans were geese.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nThe successful navigation of lower Tower Street, at noonday, required\npresence of mind on the part of the pedestrian. There were currents and\ncounter-currents, eddies and backwaters, and at the corner of Vine a\nveritable maelstrom through which two lines of electric cars pushed\ntheir way, east and weft, north and south, with incessant clanging\nof bells; followed by automobiles with resounding horns, trucks and\ndelivery wagons with wheels reverberating on the granite. A giant Irish\npoliceman, who seemed in continual danger of a violent death, and wholly\nindifferent to it, stood between the car tracks and halted the rush from\ntime to time, driving the people like sheep from one side to the other.\nThrough the doors of Ferguson's poured two conflicting streams of\nhumanity, and wistful groups of young women, on the way from hasty\nlunches, blocked the pavements and stared at the finery behind the\nplate-glass windows.\n\nThe rector, slowly making his way westward, permitted himself to be\nthrust hither and thither, halted and shoved on again as he studied the\nfaces of the throng. And presently he found himself pocketed before one\nof the exhibits of feminine interest, momentarily helpless, listening\nto the admiring and envious chorus of a bevy of diminutive shop-girls\non the merits of a Paris gown. It was at this moment that he perceived,\npushing towards him with an air of rescue, the figure of his vestryman,\nMr. Wallis Plimpton.\n\n\"Well, well, well!\" he cried, as he seized Hodder by the arm and pulled\nhim towards the curb. \"What are you doing herein the marts of trade?\nCome right along with me to the Eyrie, and we'll have something, to\neat.\"\n\nThe Eyrie was a famous lunch club, of limited membership, at the top of\nthe Parr Building, where financial affairs of the first importance were\ndiscussed and settled.\n\nHodder explained that he had lunched at half-past twelve.\n\n\"Well, step into my office a minute. It does me good, to see you again,\nupon my word, and I can't let you get by without a little pow-wow.\"\n\nMr. Plimpton's trust company, in Vine Street, resembled a Greek temple.\nMassive but graceful granite columns adorned its front, while within it\nwas partitioned off with polished marble and ornamental grills. In the\nrear, guarded by the desks and flanked by the compartments of various\nsubordinates, was the president's private sanctum, and into this holy of\nholies Mr. Plimpton led the way with the simple, unassuming genial air\nof the high priest of modern finance who understands men. The room\nwas eloquent almost to affectation of the system and order of great\nbusiness, inasmuch as it betrayed not the least sign of a workshop. On\nthe dark oak desk were two leather-bound books and a polished telephone.\nThe walls were panelled, there was a stone fireplace with andirons\nset, a deep carpet spread over the tessellated floor, and three\nleather-padded armchairs, one of which Mr. Plimpton hospitably drew\nforward for the rector. He then produced a box of cigars.\n\n\"You don't smoke, Mr. Hodder. I always forget. That's the way you manage\nto keep yourself in such good shape.\" He drew out a gold match box and\nseated himself with an air of gusto opposite his guest. \"And you haven't\nhad a vacation, they tell me.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said the rector, \"McCrae has taken the services all\nsummer.\"\n\n\"But you've been in the city!\" Mr. Plimpton exclaimed, puffing at his\ncigar.\n\n\"Yes, I've been in the city.\"\n\n\"Well, well, I'll bet you haven't been idle. Just between us, as\nfriends, Mr. Hodder, I've often wondered if you didn't work too\nhard--there's such a thing as being too conscientious, you know.\nAnd I've an idea that the rest of the vestry think so. Mr. Parr, for\ninstance. We know when we've got a good thing, and we don't want to wear\nyou out. Oh, we can appreciate your point of view, and admire it. But a\nlittle relaxation--eh? It's too bad that you couldn't have seen your way\nto take that cruise--Mr. Parr was all cut up about it. I guess you're\nthe only man among all of us fairly close to him, who really knows him\nwell,\" said Mr. Plimpton, admiringly. \"He thinks a great deal of you,\nMr. Hodder. By the way, have you seen him since he got back?\"\n\n\"No,\" Hodder answered.\n\n\n\"The trip did him good. I thought he was a little seedy in the\nspring--didn't you? Wonderful man! And when I think how he's slandered\nand abused it makes me hot. And he never says anything, never\ncomplains, lives up there all alone, and takes his medicine. That's\nreal patriotism, according to my view. He could retire to-morrow--but\nhe keeps on--why? Because he feels the weight of a tremendous\nresponsibility on his shoulders, because he knows if it weren't for him\nand men like him upon whom the prosperity of this nation depends, we'd\nhave famine and anarchy on our hands in no time. And look what he's\ndone for the city, without ostentation, mind you! He never blows his own\nhorn-never makes a speech. And for the Church! But I needn't tell you.\nWhen this settlement house and chapel are finished, they'll be coming\nout here from New York to get points. By the way, I meant to have\nwritten you. Have our revised plans come yet? We ought to break ground\nin November, oughtn't we?\"\n\n\"I intend to lay my views on that matter before the vestry at the next\nmeeting, the rector said.\n\n\"Well,\" declared Mr. Plimpton, after a scarcely perceptible pause, \"I've\nno doubt they'll be worth listening to. If I were to make a guess,\" he\ncontinued, with a contemplative smile, blowing a thin stream of smoke\ntowards the distant ceiling, \"I should bet that you have spent your\nsummer looking over the ground. I don't say that you have missed your\nvocation, Mr. Hodder, but I don't mind telling you that for a clergyman,\nfor a man absorbed in spiritual matters, a man who can preach\nthe sermons you preach, you've got more common-sense and business\nthoroughness than any one I have ever run across in your profession.\"\n\n\"Looking over the ground?\" Hodder repeated, ignoring the compliment.\n\n\"Sure,\" said Mr. Plimpton, smiling more benignly than ever. \"You mustn't\nbe modest about it. Dalton Street. And when that settlement house is\nbuilt, I'll guarantee it will be run on a business basis. No nonsense.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by nonsense?\" Hodder asked. He did not make the\nquestion abrupt, and there was even the hint of a smile in his eyes,\nwhich Mr. Plimpton found the more disquieting.\n\n\"Why, that's only a form of speech. I mean you'll be practical,\nefficient, that you'll get hold of the people of that neighbourhood and\nmake 'em see that the world isn't such a bad place after all, make 'em\nrealize that we in St. John's want to help 'em out. That you won't\nmake them more foolishly discontented than they are, and go preaching\nsocialism to them.\"\n\n\"I have no intention of preaching socialism,\" said Hodder. But he laid a\nslight emphasis on the word which sent a cold shiver down Mr. Plimpton's\nspine, and made him wonder whether there might not be something worse\nthan socialism.\n\n\"I knew you wouldn't,\" he declared, with all the heartiness he could\nthrow into his voice. \"I repeat, you're a practical, sensible man.\nI'll yield to none in my belief in the Church as a moral, uplifting,\nnecessary spiritual force in our civilization, in my recognition of her\nhigh ideals, but we business men, Mr. Hodder,--as--I am sure you must\nagree,--have got to live, I am sorry to say, on a lower plane. We've\ngot to deal with the world as we find it, and do our little best to help\nthings along. We can't take the Gospel literally, or we should all be\nruined in a day, and swamp everybody else. You understand me?\n\n\"I understand you,\" said the rector.\n\nMr. Plimpton's cigar had gone out. In spite of himself, he had slipped\nfrom the easy-going, casual tone into one that was becoming persuasive,\napologetic, strenuous. Although the day was not particularly warm, he\nbegan to perspire a little; and he repeated the words over to himself,\n\"I understand you.\" What the deuce did the rector know? He had somehow\nthe air of knowing everything--more than Mr. Plimpton did. And Mr.\nPlimpton was beginning to have the unusual and most disagreeable feeling\nof having been weighed in the balance and found wanting. He glanced at\nhis guest, who sat quite still, the head bent a trifle, the disturbing\ngray eyes fixed contemplatively an him--accusingly. And yet the\naccusation did not seem personal with the clergyman, whose eyes were\nnearly the medium, the channels of a greater, an impersonal Ice. It was\ntrue that the man had changed. He was wholly baffling to Mr. Plimpton,\nwhose sense of alarm increased momentarily into an almost panicky\nfeeling as he remembered what Langmaid had said. Was this inscrutable\nrector of St. John's gazing, knowingly, at the half owner of Harrods\nHotel in Dalton Street, who couldn't take the Gospel literally?\nThere was evidently no way to find out at once, and suspense would be\nunbearable, in vain he told himself that these thoughts were nonsense,\nthe discomfort persisted, and he had visions of that career in which\nhe had become one of the first citizens and the respected husband of\nCharlotte Gore clashing down about his ears. Why? Because a clergyman\nshould choose to be quixotic, fanatical? He did not took quixotic,\nfanatical, Mr. Plimpton had to admit,--but a good deal saner than he,\nMr. Plimpton, must have appeared at that moment. His throat was dry, and\nhe didn't dare to make the attempt to relight his cigar.\n\n\"There's nothing like getting together--keeping in touch with people,\nMr. Hodder,\" he managed to say. \"I've been out of town a good deal this\nsummer--putting on a little flesh, I'm sorry to admit. But I've been\nmeaning to drop into the parish house and talk over those revised plans\nwith you. I will drop in--in a day or two. I'm interested in the work,\nintensely interested, and so is Mrs. Plimpton. She'll help you. I'm\nsorry you can't lunch with me.\"\n\nHe had the air, now, of the man who finds himself disagreeably and\nunexpectedly closeted with a lunatic; and his language, although he\nsought to control it, became even a trifle less coherent.\n\n\"You must make allowances for us business men, Mr. Hodder. I mean, of\ncourse, we're sometimes a little lax in our duties--in the summer, that\nis. Don't shoot the pianist, he's doing his--ahem! You know the story.\n\n\"By the way, I hear great things of you; I'm told it's on the cards that\nyou're to be made a bishop.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" answered the rector, \"there are better men mentioned than I!\"\n\n\"I want you to know this,\" said his vestryman, as he seized Hodder's\nhand, \"much as we value you here, bitterly as we should hate to lose\nyou, none of us, I am sure, would stand in the way of such a deserved\nadvancement.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Plimpton,\" said the rector.\n\nMr. Plimpton watched the vigorous form striding through the great\nchamber until it disappeared. Then he seized his hat and made his way\nas rapidly as possible through the crowds to the Parr Building. At the\nentrance of the open-air roof garden of the Eyrie he ran into Nelson\nLangmaid.\n\n\"You're the very man I'm after,\" said Mr. Plimpton, breathlessly. \"I\nstopped in your office, and they said you'd gone up.\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Wallis?\" inquired the lawyer, tranquilly. \"You look\nas if you'd lost a couple of bonds.\"\n\n\"I've just seen Hodder, and he is going to do it.\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Sit down here, at this table in the corner, and I'll tell you.\"\n\nFor a practical man, it must be admitted that Mr. Plimpton had very\nlittle of the concrete to relate. And it appeared on cross-examination\nby Mr. Langmaid, who ate his cold meat and salad with an exasperating\nand undiminished appetite--that the only definite thing the rector had\nsaid was that he didn't intend to preach socialism. This was reassuring.\n\n\"Reassuring!\" exclaimed Mr. Plimpton, whose customary noonday hunger was\nlacking, \"I wish you could have heard him say it!\"\n\n\"The wicked,\" remarked the lawyer, \"flee when no man pursueth. Don't\nshoot the pianist!\" Langmaid set down his beer, and threw back his\nhead and laughed. \"If I were the Reverend Mr. Hodder, after such an\nexhibition as you gave, I should immediately have suspected the pianist\nof something, and I should have gone off by myself and racked my brains\nand tried to discover what it was. He's a clever man, and if he hasn't\ngot a list of Dalton Street property now he'll have one by to-morrow,\nand the story of some of your transactions with Tom Beatty and the City\nCouncil.\"\n\n\"I believe you'd joke in the electric chair,\" said Mr. a Plimpton,\nresentfully. \"I'll tell you this,--and my experience backs me up,--if\nyou can't get next to a man by a little plain talk, he isn't safe. I\nhaven't got the market sense for nothing, and I'll give you this tip,\nNelson,--it's time to stand from under. Didn't I warn you fellows that\nBedloe Hubbell meant business long before he started in? and this parson\ncan give Hubbell cards and spades. Hodder can't see this thing as it\nis. He's been thinking, this summer. And a man of that kind is downright\ndangerous when he begins to think. He's found out things, and he's put\ntwo and two together, and he's the uncompromising type. He has a notion\nthat the Gospel can be taken literally, and I could feel all the time I\nwas talking to him he thought I was a crook.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he was right,\" observed the lawyer.\n\n\"That comes well from you,\" Mr. Plimpton retorted.\n\n\"Oh, I'm a crook, too,\" said Langmaid. \"I discovered it some time ago.\nThe difference between you and me, Wallis, is that I am willing to\nacknowledge it, and you're not. The whole business world, as we know\nit, is crooked, and if we don't cut other people's throats, they'll cut\nours.\"\n\n\"And if we let go, what would happen to the country?\" his companion\ndemanded.\n\nLangmaid began to shake with silent laughter.\n\n\"Your solicitude about the country, Wallis, is touching. I was brought\nup to believe that patriotism had an element of sacrifice in it, but\nI can't see ours. And I can't imagine myself, somehow, as a Hercules\nbearing the burden of our Constitution. From Mr. Hodder's point of view,\nperhaps,--and I'm not sure it isn't the right one, the pianist is doing\nhis damnedest, to the tune of--Dalton Street. We might as well look this\nthing in the face, my friend. You and I really don't believe in another\nworld, or we shouldn't be taking so much trouble to make this one as\nwe'd like to have it.\"\n\n\"I never expected to hear you talk this way,\" said Mr. Plimpton.\n\n\"Well, it's somewhat of a surprise to me,\" the lawyer admitted.\n\n\"And I don't think you put it fairly,\" his friend contended. \"I never\ncan tell when you are serious, but this is damned serious. In business\nwe have to deal with crooks, who hold us up right and left, and if we\nstood back you know as well as I do that everything would go to pot. And\nif we let the reformers have their way the country would be bedlam. We'd\nhave anarchy and bloodshed, revolution, and the people would be calling\nus, the strong men, back in no time. You can't change human nature.\nAnd we have a sense of responsibility--we support law and order and the\nChurch, and found institutions, and give millions away in charity.\"\n\nThe big lawyer listened to this somewhat fervent defence of his order\nwith an amused smile, nodding his head slightly from side to side.\n\n\"If you don't believe in it,\" demanded Mr. Plimpton, \"why the deuce don't\nyou drop it?\"\n\n\"It's because of my loyalty,\" said Langmaid. \"I wouldn't desert my pals.\nI couldn't bear, Wallis, to see you go to the guillotine without me.\"\n\nMr. Plimpton became unpleasantly silent.\n\n\"Well, you may think it's a joke,\" he resumed, after a moment, \"but\nthere will be a guillotine if we don't look out. That confounded parson\nis getting ready to spring something, and I'm going to give Mr. Parr a\ntip. He'll know how to handle him. He doesn't talk much, but I've got an\nidea, from one or two things he let drop, that he's a little suspicious\nof a change in Hodder. But he ought to be waived.\"\n\n\"You're in no condition to talk to Mr. Parr, or to anyone else, except\nyour wife, Walks,\" Langmaid said. \"You'd better go home, and let me see\nMr. Parr. I'm responsible for Mr. Hodder, anyway.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Mr. Plimpton agreed, as though he had gained some shred of\ncomfort from this thought. \"I guess you're in worse than any of us.\"\n\n\n\n\nVolume 6.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. THE ARRAIGNMENT\n\n\nI\n\nLooking backward, Hodder perceived that he had really come to the\nmomentous decision of remaining at St. John's in the twilight of an\nevening when, on returning home from seeing Kate Marcy at Mr. Bentley's\nhe had entered the darkening church. It was then that his mission\nhad appeared to him as a vision. Every day, afterward, his sense and\nknowledge of this mission had grown stronger.\n\nTo his mind, not the least of the trials it was to impose upon him, and\none which would have to be dealt with shortly, was a necessary talk with\nhis assistant, McCrae. If their relationship had from the beginning been\nunusual and unsatisfactory, adjectives would seem to defy what it had\nbecome during the summer. What did McCrae think of him? For Hodder\nhad, it will be recalled, bidden his assistant good-by--and then had\nremained. At another brief interview, during which McCrae had betrayed\nno surprise, uttered no censure or comment, Hodder had announced\nhis determination to remain in the city, and to take no part in the\nservices. An announcement sufficiently astounding. During the months\nthat followed, they had met, at rare intervals, exchanged casual\ngreetings, and passed on. And yet Hodder had the feeling, more firmly\nplanted than ever, that McCrae was awaiting, with an interest which\nmight be called suspense, the culmination of the process going on within\nhim.\n\nWell, now that he had worked it out, now that he had reached his\ndecision, it was incumbent upon him to tell his assistant what that\ndecision was. Hodder shrank from it as from an ordeal. His affection\nfor the man, his admiration for McCrae's faithful, untiring, and\nunrecognized services had deepened. He had a theory that McCrae\nreally liked him--would even sympathize with his solution; yet he\nprocrastinated. He was afraid to put his theory to the test. It was not\nthat Hodder feared that his own solution was not the right one, but that\nMcCrae might not find it so: he was intensely concerned that it should\nalso be McCrae's solution--the answer, if one liked, to McCrae's mute\nand eternal questionings. He wished to have it a fruition for McCrae as\nwell as for himself; since theoretically, at least, he had pierced the\nhard crust of his assistant's exterior, and conceived him beneath to be\nall suppressed fire. In short, Hodder wished to go into battle side by\nside with McCrae. Therein lay his anxiety.\n\nAnother consideration troubled him--McCrae's family, dependent on a\nrather meagre salary. His assistant, in sustaining him in the struggle\nhe meant to enter, would be making even a greater sacrifice than\nhimself. For Hodder had no illusions, and knew that the odds against\nhim were incalculable. Whatever, if defeated, his own future might be,\nMcCrae's was still more problematical and tragic.\n\nThe situation, when it came, was even more difficult than Hodder\nhad imagined it, since McCrae was not a man to oil the wheels of\nconversation. In silence he followed the rector up the stairs and into\nhis study, in silence he took the seat at the opposite side of the\ntable. And Hodder, as he hesitated over his opening, contemplated in no\nlittle perplexity and travail the gaunt and non-committal face before\nhim:\n\n\"McCrae,\" he began at length, \"you must have thought my conduct this\nsummer most peculiar. I wish to thank you, first of all, for the\nconsideration you have shown me, and to tell you how deeply I appreciate\nyour taking the entire burden of the work of the parish.\"\n\nMcCrae shook his head vigorously, but did not speak.\n\n\"I owe it to you to give you some clew to what happened to me,\" the\nrector continued, \"although I have an idea that you do not need much\nenlightenment on this matter. I have a feeling that you have somehow\nbeen aware of my discouragement during the past year or so, and of the\ncauses of it. You yourself hold ideals concerning the Church which you\nhave not confided to me. Of this I am sure. I came here to St. John's\nfull of hope and confidence, gradually to lose both, gradually to\nrealise that there was something wrong with me, that in spite of all\nmy efforts I was unable to make any headway in the right direction. I\nbecame perplexed, dissatisfied--the results were so meagre, so out of\nproportion to the labour. And the very fact that those who may be called\nour chief parishioners had no complaint merely added to my uneasiness.\nThat kind of success didn't satisfy me, and I venture to assume it\ndidn't satisfy you.\"\n\nStill McCrae made no sign.\n\n\"Finally I came to what may be termed a double conclusion. In the first\nplace, I began to see more and more clearly that our modern civilization\nis at fault, to perceive how completely it is conducted on the\nmaterialistic theory of the survival of the fittest rather than that of\nthe brotherhood of man, and that those who mainly support this church\nare, consciously or not, using it as a bulwark for the privilege they\nhave gained at the expense of their fellow-citizens. And my conclusion\nwas that Christianity must contain some vital germ which I had somehow\nmissed, and which I must find if I could, and preach and release it.\nThat it was the release of this germ these people feared unconsciously.\nI say to you, at the risk of the accusation of conceit, that I believed\nmyself to have a power in the pulpit if I could only discover the\ntruth.\"\n\nHodder thought he detected, as he spoke these words, a certain\nrelaxation of the tension.\n\n\"For a while, as the result of discouragement, of cowardice, I may\nsay, of the tearing-down process of the theological structure--built of\ndebris from many ruins on which my conception of Christianity rested,\nI lost all faith. For many weeks I did not enter the church, as you\nyourself must know. Then, when I had given up all hope, through certain\nincidents and certain persona, a process of reconstruction began. In\nshort, through no virtue which I can claim as my own, I believe I have\narrived at the threshold of an understanding of Christianity as our Lord\ntaught it and lived it. And I intend to take the pulpit and begin to\npreach it.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned in regard to yourself as to what effect my course\nmay have on you. And I am not you to listen to me with a view that you\nshould see your way clear to support me McCrae, but rather that you\nshould be fully apprised of my new belief and intentions. I owe this\nto you, for your loyal support in the pest. I shall go over with you,\nlater, if you care to listen, my whole position. It may be called the\nextreme Protestant position, and I use protestant, for want of a better\nword, to express what I believe is Paul's true as distinguished from the\nfalse of his two inconsistent theologies. It was this doctrine of Paul's\nof redemption by faith, of reacting grace by an inevitable spiritual\nlaw--of rebirth, if you will--that Luther and the Protestant reformers\nrevived and recognized, rightly, as the vital element of Christ's\nteachings, although they did not succeed in separating it wholly\nfrom the dross which clung to it. It is the leaven which has changed\ngovernments, and which in the end, I am firmly convinced, will make true\ndemocracy inevitable. And those who oppose democracy inherently dread\nits workings.\n\n\"I do not know your views, but it is only fair to add at this time that\nI no longer believe in the external and imposed authority of the Church\nin the sense in which I formerly accepted it, nor in the virgin birth,\nnor in certain other dogmas in which I once acquiesced. Other clergymen\nof our communion have proclaimed, in speech and writing, their disbelief\nin these things. I have satisfied my conscience as they have, and I mean\nto make no secret of my change. I am convinced that not one man or woman\nin ten thousand to-day who has rejected Christianity ever knew\nwhat Christianity is. The science and archaic philosophy in which\nChristianity has been swaddled and hampered is discredited, and the\nconclusion is drawn that Christianity itself must be discredited.\"\n\n\"Ye're going to preach all this?\" McCrae demanded, almost fiercely.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hodder replied, still uncertain as to his assistant's attitude,\n\"and more. I have fully reflected, and I am willing to accept all the\nconsequences. I understand perfectly, McCrae, that the promulgation\nalone of the liberal orthodoxy of which I have spoken will bring me into\nconflict with the majority of the vestry and the congregation, and that\nthe bishop will be appealed to. They will say, in effect, that I have\ncheated them, that they hired one man and that another has turned up,\nwhom they never would have hired. But that won't be the whole story. If\nit were merely a question of doctrine, I should resign. It's deeper than\nthat, more sinister.\" Hodder doubled up his hand, and laid it on the\ntable. \"It's a matter,\" he said, looking into McCrae's eyes, \"of freeing\nthis church from those who now hold it in chains. And the two questions,\nI see clearly now, the doctrinal and the economic, are so interwoven as\nto be inseparable. My former, ancient presentation of Christianity left\nmen and women cold. It did not draw them into this church and send them\nout again fired with the determination to bring religion into everyday\nlife, resolved to do their part in the removal of the injustices and\ncruelties with which we are surrounded, to bring Christianity into\ngovernment, where it belongs. Don't misunderstand me I'm not going to\npreach politics, but religion.\"\n\n\"I don't misunderstand ye,\" answered McCrae. He leaned a little forward,\nstaring at the rector from behind his steel spectacles with a glance\nwhich had become piercing.\n\n\"And I am going to discourage a charity which is a mockery of\nChristianity,\" Hodder went on, \"the spectacle of which turns thousands\nof men and women in sickening revolt against the Church of Christ\nto-day. I have discovered, at last, how some of these persons have made\ntheir money, and are making it. And I am going to let them know, since\nthey have repudiated God in their own souls, since they have denied the\nChristian principle of individual responsibility, that I, as the vicar\nof God, will not be a party to the transaction of using the Church as a\nmeans of doling out ill-gotten gains to the poor.\"\n\n\"Mr. Parr!\" McCrae exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the rector, slowly, and with a touch of sadness, \"since you\nhave mentioned him, Mr. Parr. But I need not say that this must go no\nfarther. I am in possession of definite facts in regard to Mr. Parr\nwhich I shall present to him when he returns.\"\n\n\"Ye'll tell him to his face?\"\n\n\"It is the only way.\"\n\nMcCrae had risen. A remarkable transformation had come over the man,--he\nwas reminiscent, at that moment, of some Covenanter ancestor going into\nbattle. And his voice shook with excitement.\n\n\"Ye may count on me, Mr. Hodder,\" he cried. \"These many years I've\nwaited, these many years I've seen what ye see now, but I was not the\nman. Aye, I've watched ye, since the day ye first set foot in this\nchurch. I knew what was going on inside of ye, because it was just that\nI felt myself. I hoped--I prayed ye might come to it.\"\n\nThe sight of this taciturn Scotchman, moved in this way, had an\nextraordinary effect on Hodder himself, and his own emotion was so\ninexpressibly stirred that he kept silence a moment to control it.\nThis proof of the truth of his theory in regard to McCrae he found\noverwhelming.\n\n\"But you said nothing, McCrae,\" he began presently. \"I felt all along\nthat you knew what was wrong--if you had only spoken.\"\n\n\"I could not,\" said McCrae. \"I give ye my word I tried, but I just could\nnot. Many's the time I wanted to--but I said to myself, when I looked at\nyou, 'wait, it will come, much better than ye can say it.' And ye have\nmade me see more than I saw, Mr. Hodder,--already ye have. Ye've got\nthe whole thing in ye're eye, and I only had a part of it. It's because\nye're the bigger man of the two.\"\n\n\"You thought I'd come to it?\" demanded Hodder, as though the full force\nof this insight had just struck him.\n\n\"Well,\" said McCrae, \"I hoped. It seemed, to look at ye, ye'r true\nnature--what was by rights inside of ye. That's the best explaining I\ncan do. And I call to mind that time ye spoke about not making the men\nin the classes Christians--that was what started me to thinking.\"\n\n\"And you asked me,\" returned the rector, \"how welcome some of them would\nbe in Mr. Parr's Pew.\"\n\n\"Ah, it worried me,\" declared the assistant, with characteristic\nfrankness, \"to see how deep ye were getting in with him.\"\n\nHodder did not reply to this. He had himself risen, and stood looking at\nMcCrae, filled with a new thought.\n\n\"There is one thing I should like to say to you--which is very\ndifficult, McCrae, but I have no doubt you see the matter as clearly as\nI do. In making this fight, I have no one but myself to consider. I am a\nsingle man--\"\n\n\"Yell not need to go on,\" answered McCrae, with an odd mixture of\nsternness and gentleness in his voice. \"I'll stand and fall with ye, Mr.\nHodder. Before I ever thought of the Church I learned a trade, as a boy\nin Scotland. I'm not a bad carpenter. And if worse comes to worse, I've\nan idea I can make as much with my hands as I make in the ministry.\"\n\nThe smile they exchanged across the table sealed the compact between\nthem.\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe electric car which carried him to his appointment with the financier\nshot westward like a meteor through the night. And now that the hour was\nactually at hand, it seemed to Hodder that he was absurdly unprepared to\nmeet it. New and formidable aspects, hitherto unthought of, rose in his\nmind, and the figure of Eldon Parr loomed to Brobdingnagian proportions\nas he approached it. In spite of his determination, the life-blood of\nhis confidence ebbed, a sense of the power and might of the man who had\nnow become his adversary increased; and that apprehension of the impact\nof the great banker's personality, the cutting edge with the vast\nachievements wedged in behind it, each adding weight and impetus to its\nmomentum the apprehension he had felt in less degree on the day of the\nfirst meeting, and which had almost immediately evaporated--surged up\nin him now. His fear was lest the charged atmosphere of the banker's\npresence might deflect his own hitherto clear perception of true worth.\nHe dreaded, once in the midst of those disturbing currents, a bungling\npresentation of the cause which inspired him, and which he knew to be\nrighteousness itself.\n\nSuddenly his mood shifted, betraying still another weakness, and he\nsaw Eldon Parr, suddenly, vividly--more vividly, indeed, than ever\nbefore--in the shades of the hell of his loneliness. And pity welled\nup, drowning the image of incarnate greed and selfishness and lust for\nwealth and power: The unique pathos of his former relationship with\nthe man reasserted itself, and Hodder was conscious once more of the\ndependence which Eldon Parr had had on his friendship. During that\nfriendship he, Hodder, had never lost the sense of being the stronger\nof the two, of being leaned upon: leaned upon by a man whom the world\nfeared and hated, and whom he had been enable to regard with anything\nbut compassion and the unquestionable affection which sprang from it.\nAppalled by this transition, he alighted from the car, and stood for a\nmoment alone in the darkness gazing at the great white houses that rose\nabove the dusky outline of shrubbery and trees.\n\nAt any rate, he wouldn't find that sense of dependence to-night. And it\nsteeled him somewhat to think, as he resumed his steps, that he would\nmeet now the other side, the hard side hitherto always turned away. Had\nhe needed no other warning of this, the answer to his note asking for\nan appointment would have been enough,--a brief and formal communication\nsigned by the banker's secretary...\n\n\"Mr. Parr is engaged just at present, sir,\" said the servant who opened\nthe door. \"Would you be good enough to step into the library?\"\n\nHardly had he entered the room when he heard a sound behind him, and\nturned to confront Alison. The thought of her, too, had complicated\ninfinitely his emotions concerning the interview before him, and the\nsight of her now, of her mature beauty displayed in evening dress, of\nher white throat gleaming whiter against the severe black of her gown,\nmade him literally speechless. Never had he accused her of boldness, and\nnow least of all. It was the quality of her splendid courage that\nwas borne in upon him once more above the host of other feelings and\nimpressions, for he read in her eyes a knowledge of the meaning of his\nvisit.\n\nThey stood facing each other an appreciable moment.\n\n\"Mr. Langmaid is with him now,\" she said, in a low voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered.\n\nHer eyes still rested on his face, questioningly, appraisingly, as\nthough she were seeking to estimate his preparedness for the\nordeal before him, his ability to go through with it successfully,\ntriumphantly. And in her mention of Langmaid he recognized that she had\nmeant to sound a note of warning. She had intimated a consultation of\nthe captains, a council of war. And yet he had never spoken to her of\nthis visit. This proof of her partisanship, that she had come to him at\nthe crucial instant, overwhelmed him.\n\n\"You know why I am here?\" he managed to say. It had to do with the\nextent of her knowledge.\n\n\"Oh, why shouldn't I?\" she cried, \"after what you have told me. And\ncould you think I didn't understand, from the beginning, that it meant\nthis?\"\n\nHis agitation still hampered him. He made a gesture of assent.\n\n\"It was inevitable,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, it' was inevitable,\" she assented, and walked slowly to the\nmantel, resting her hand on it and bending her head. \"I felt that you\nwould not shirk it, and yet I realize how painful it must be to you.\"\n\n\"And to you,\" he replied quickly.\n\n\"Yes, and to me. I do not know what you know, specifically,--I have\nnever sought to find out things, in detail. That would be horrid. But\nI understand--in general--I have understood for many years.\" She raised\nher head, and flashed him a glance that was between a quivering smile\nand tears. \"And I know that you have certain specific information.\"\n\nHe could only wonder at her intuition.\n\n\"So far as I am concerned, it is not for the world,\" he answered.\n\n\"Oh, I appreciate that in you!\" she exclaimed. \"I wished you to know\nit. I wished you to know,\" she added, a little unsteadily, \"how much\nI admire you for what you are doing. They are afraid of you--they will\ncrush you if they can.\"\n\nHe did not reply.\n\n\"But you are going to speak the truth,\" she continued, her voice low and\nvibrating, \"that is splendid! It must have its effect, no matter what\nhappens.\"\n\n\"Do you feel that?\" he asked, taking a step toward her.\n\n\"Yes. When I see you, I feel it, I think.\"...\n\nWhatever answer he might have made to this was frustrated by the\nappearance of the figure of Nelson Langmaid in the doorway. He seemed to\nsurvey them benevolently through his spectacles.\n\n\"How are you, Hodder? Well, Alison, I have to leave without seeing\nanything of you--you must induce your father not to bring his business\nhome with him. Just a word,\" he added to the rector, \"before you go up.\"\n\nHodder turned to Alison. \"Good night,\" he said.\n\nThe gentle but unmistakable pressure of her hand he interpreted as\nthe pinning on him of the badge of her faith. He was to go into battle\nwearing her colours. Their eyes met.\n\n\"Good night,\" she answered....\n\nIn the hall the lawyer took his arm.\n\n\"What's the trouble, Hodder?\" he asked, sympathetically.\n\nHodder, although on his guard, was somewhat taken aback by the\ndirectness of the onslaught.\n\n\"I'm afraid, Mr. Langmaid,\" the rector replied, \"that it would take me\nlonger to tell you than the time at your disposal.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said the lawyer, \"this is too bad. Why didn't you come to\nme? I am a good friend of yours, Hodder, and there is an additional bond\nbetween us on my sister's account. She is extremely fond of you, you\nknow. And I have a certain feeling of responsibility for you,--I brought\nyou here.\"\n\n\"You have always been very kind, and I appreciate it,\" Hodder replied.\n\"I should be sorry to cause you any worry or annoyance. But you must\nunderstand that I cannot share the responsibility of my acts with any\none.\"\n\n\"A little advice from an old legal head is sometimes not out of place.\nEven Dr. Gilman used to consult me. I hope you will bear in mind how\nremarkably well you have been getting along at St. John's, and what a\nsuccess you've made.\"\n\n\"Success!\" echoed the rector.\n\nEither Mr. Langmaid read nothing in his face, or was determined to read\nnothing.\n\n\"Assuredly,\" he answered, benignly. \"You have managed to please\neverybody, Mr. Parr included,--and some of us are not easy to please.\nI thought I'd tell you this, as a friend, as your first friend in the\nparish. Your achievement has been all the more remarkable, following, as\nyou did, Dr. Gilman. Now it would greatly distress me to see that state\nof things disturbed, both for your sake and others. I thought I would\njust give you a hint, as you are going to see Mr. Parr, that he is in\nrather a nervous state. These so-called political reformers have upset\nthe market and started a lot of legal complications that's why I'm here\nto-night. Go easy with him. I know you won't do anything foolish.\"\n\nThe lawyer accompanied this statement with a pat, but this time he did\nnot succeed in concealing his concern.\n\n\"That depends on one's point of view,\" Hodder returned, with a smile. \"I\ndo not know how you have come to suspect that I am going to disturb Mr.\nParr, but what I have to say to him is between him and me.\"\n\nLangmaid took up his hat from the table, and sighed.\n\n\"Drop in on me sometime,\" he said, \"I'd like to talk to you--Hodder\nheard a voice behind him, and turned. A servant was standing there.\n\n\"Mr. Parr is ready to see you, sir,\" he said.\n\nThe rector followed him up the stairs, to the room on the second floor,\nhalf office, half study, where the capitalist transacted his business\nwhen at home.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nEldon Parr was huddled over his desk reading a typewritten document; but\nhe rose, and held out his hand, which Hodder took.\n\n\"How are you, Mr. Hodder? I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but\nmatters of some legal importance have arisen on which I was obliged to\nmake a decision. You're well, I hope.\" He shot a glance at the rector,\nand sat down again, still holding the sheets. \"If you will excuse me a\nmoment longer, I'll finish this.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Hodder replied.\n\n\"Take a chair,\" said Mr. Parr, \"you'll find the evening paper beside\nyou.\"\n\nHodder sat down, and the banker resumed his perusal of the document, his\neye running rapidly over the pages, pausing once in a while to scratch\nout a word or to make a note on the margin. In the concentration of the\nman on the task before him the rector read a design, an implication that\nthe affairs of the Church were of a minor importance: sensed, indeed,\nthe new attitude of hostility, gazed upon the undiscovered side, the\ndangerous side before which other men had quailed. Alison's words\nrecurred to him, \"they are afraid of you, they will crush you if they\ncan.\" Eldon Parr betrayed, at any rate, no sign of fear. If his mental\nposture were further analyzed, it might be made out to contain an\nintimation that the rector, by some act, had forfeited the right to the\nunique privilege of the old relationship.\n\nWell, the fact that the banker had, in some apparently occult manner,\nbeen warned, would make Hodder's task easier--or rather less difficult.\nHis feelings were even more complicated than he had anticipated. The\nmoments of suspense were trying to his nerves, and he had a shrewd\nnotion that this making men wait was a favourite manoeuvre of Eldon\nParr's; nor had he underrated the benumbing force of that personality.\nIt was evident that the financier intended him to open the battle,\nand he was--as he had expected--finding it difficult to marshal the\nregiments of his arguments. In vain he thought of the tragedy of\nGarvin.... The thing was more complicated. And behind this redoubtable\nand sinister Eldon Parr he saw, as it were, the wraith of that: other\nwho had once confessed the misery of his loneliness....\n\nAt last the banker rang, sharply, the bell on his desk. A secretary\nentered, to whom he dictated a telegram which contained these words:\n\"Langmaid has discovered a way out.\" It was to be sent to an address\nin Texas. Then he turned in his chair and crossed his knees, his hand\nfondling an ivory paper-cutter. He smiled a little.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Hodder,\" he said.\n\nThe rector, intensely on his guard, merely inclined his head in\nrecognition that his turn had come.\n\n\"I was sorry,\" the banker continued, after a perceptible pause,--\"that\nyou could not see your way clear to have come with me on the cruise.\"\n\n\"I must thank you again,\" Hodder answered, \"but I felt--as I wrote\nyou--that certain matters made it impossible for me to go.\"\n\n\"I suppose you had your reasons, but I think you would have enjoyed the\ntrip. I had a good, seaworthy boat--I chartered her from Mr. Lieber, the\npresident of the Continental Zinc, you know. I went as far as Labrador.\nA wonderful coast, Mr. Hodder.\"\n\n\"It must be,\" agreed the rector. It was clear that Mr. Parr intended to\nthrow upon him the onus of the first move. There was a silence, brief,\nindeed, but long enough for Hodder to feel more and more distinctly the\ngranite hardness which the other had become, to experience a rising,\nreenforcing anger. He went forward, steadily but resolutely, on the\ncrest of it. \"I have remained in the city,\" he continued, \"and I have\nhad the opportunity to discover certain facts of which I have hitherto\nbeen ignorant, and which, in my opinion, profoundly affect the welfare\nof the church. It is of these I wished to speak to you.\"\n\nMr. Parr waited.\n\n\"It is not much of an exaggeration to say that ever since I came here\nI have been aware that St. John's, considering the long standing of the\nparish, the situation of the church in a thickly populated district, is\nnot fulfilling its mission. But I have failed until now to perceive the\ncauses of that inefficiency.\"\n\n\"Inefficiency?\" The banker repeated the word.\n\n\"Inefficiency,\" said Hodder. \"The reproach, the responsibility is\nlargely mine, as the rector, the spiritual, head of the parish. I\nbelieve I am right when I say that the reason for the decision, some\ntwenty years ago, to leave the church where it is, instead of selling\nthe property and building in the West End, was that it might minister\nto the poor in the neighbourhood, to bring religion and hope into their\nlives, and to exert its influence towards eradicating the vice and\nmisery which surround it.\"\n\n\"But I thought you had agreed,\" said Mr. Parr, coldly, \"that we were to\nprovide for that in the new chapel and settlement house.\"\n\n\"For reasons which I hope to make plain to you, Mr. Parr,\" Hodder\nreplied, \"those people can never be reached, as they ought to be\nreached, by building that settlement house. The principle is wrong,\nthe day is past when such things can be done--in that way.\" He laid\nan emphasis on these words. \"It is good, I grant you, to care for the\nbabies and children of the poor, it is good to get young women and men\nout of the dance-halls, to provide innocent amusement, distraction,\ninstruction. But it is not enough. It leaves the great, transforming\nthing in the lives of these people untouched, and it will forever\nremain untouched so long as a sense of wrong, a continually deepening\nimpression of an unchristian civilization upheld by the Church herself,\nexists. Such an undertaking as that settlement house--I see clearly\nnow--is a palliation, a poultice applied to one of many sores, a\ncompromise unworthy of the high mission of the Church. She should go to\nthe root of the disease. It is her first business to make Christians,\nwho, by amending their own lives, by going out individually and\ncollectively into the life of the nation, will gradually remove these\nconditions.\"\n\nMr. Parr sat drumming on the table. Hodder met his look.\n\n\"So you, too, have come to it,\" he said.\n\n\"Have come to what?\"\n\n\"Socialism.\"\n\nHodder, in the state of clairvoyance in which he now surprisingly found\nhimself, accurately summed up the value and meaning of the banker's\nsigh.\n\n\"Say, rather,\" he replied, \"that I have come to Christianity. We\nshall never have what is called socialism until there is no longer\nany necessity for it, until men, of their owe free will, are ready to\nrenounce selfish, personal ambition and power and work for humanity, for\nthe state.\"\n\nMr. Parr's gesture implied that he cared not by what name the thing was\ncalled, but he still appeared strangely, astonishingly calm;--Hodder,\nwith all his faculties acute, apprehended that he was dangerously calm.\nThe man who had formerly been his friend was now completely obliterated,\nand he had the feeling almost of being about to grapple, in mortal\ncombat, with some unknown monster whose tactics and resources were\ninfinite, whose victims had never escaped. The monster was in Eldon\nParr--that is how it came to him. The waxy, relentless demon was\naroused. It behooved him, Hodder, to step carefully....\n\n\"That is all very fine, Mr. Hodder, very altruistic, very Christian,\nI've no doubt-but the world doesn't work that way.\" (These were the\nwords borne in on Hodder's consciousness.) \"What drives the world is the\nmotive furnished by the right of acquiring and holding property. If we\nhad a division to-day, the able men would come out on top next year.\"\n\nThe rector shook his head. He remembered, at that moment, Horace\nBentley.\n\n\"What drives the world is a far higher motive, Mr. Parr, the motive\nwith which have been fired the great lights of history, the motive of\nrenunciation and service which is transforming governments, which is\ngradually making the world a better place in which to live. And we are\nseeing men and women imbued with it, rising in ever increasing numbers\non every side to-day.\"\n\n\"Service!\" Eldon Parr had seized upon the word as it passed and held it.\n\"What do you think my life has been? I suppose,\" he said, with a touch\nof intense bitterness, \"that you, too, who six months ago seemed\nas reasonable a man as I ever met, have joined in the chorus of\ndenunciators. It has become the fashion to-day, thanks to your\nsocialists, reformers, and agitators, to decry a man because he is rich,\nto take it for granted that he is a thief and a scoundrel, that he\nhas no sense of responsibility for his country and his fellow-men. The\nglory, the true democracy of this nation, lies in its equal opportunity\nfor all. They take no account of that, of the fact that each has had the\nsame chance as his fellows. No, but they cry out that the man who, by\nthe sweat of his brow, has earned wealth ought to divide it up with the\nlazy and the self-indulgent and the shiftless.\n\n\"Take my case, for instance,--it is typical of thousands. I came to this\ncity as a boy in my teens, with eight dollars in my pocket which I had\nearned on a farm. I swept the floor, cleaned the steps, moved boxes\nand ran errands in Gabriel Parker's store on Third Street. I was\nindustrious, sober, willing to do anything. I fought, I tell you every\ninch of my way. As soon as I saved a little money I learned to use every\nounce of brain I possessed to hold on to it. I trusted a man once, and\nI had to begin all over again. And I discovered, once for all, if a man\ndoesn't look out for himself, no one will.\n\n\"I don't pretend that I am any better than any one else, I have had to\ntake life as I found it, and make the best of it. I conformed to the\nrules of the game; I soon had sense enough knocked into me to understand\nthat the conditions were not of my making. But I'll say this for\nmyself,\" Eldon Parr leaned forward over the blotter, \"I had standards,\nand I stuck by them. I wanted to be a decent citizen, to bring up my\nchildren in the right way. I didn't squander my money, when I got it,\non wine and women, I respected other men's wives, I supported the Church\nand the institutions of the city. I too even I had my ambitions, my\nideals--and they were not entirely worldly ones. You would probably\naccuse me of wishing to acquire only the position of power which I hold.\nIf you had accepted my invitation to go aboard the yacht this summer, it\nwas my intention to unfold to you a scheme of charities which has long\nbeen forming in my mind, and which I think would be of no small benefit\nto the city where I have made my fortune. I merely mention this to prove\nto you that I am not unmindful, in spite of the circumstances of my\nown life, of the unfortunates whose mental equipment is not equal to my\nown.\"\n\nBy this \"poor boy\" argument which--if Hodder had known--Mr. Parr had\nused at banquets with telling effect, the banker seemed to regain\nperspective and equilibrium, to plant his feet once more on the rock\nof the justification of his life, and from which, by a somewhat\nextraordinary process he had not quite understood, he had been partially\nshaken off. As he had proceeded with his personal history, his manner\nhad gradually become one of the finality of experience over theory,\nof the forbearance of the practical man with the visionary. Like most\nsuccessful citizens of his type, he possessed in a high degree\nthe faculty of creating sympathy, of compelling others to\naccept--temporarily, at least--his point of view. It was this faculty,\nHodder perceived, which had heretofore laid an enchantment upon him,\nand it was not without a certain wonder that he now felt himself to be\nreleased from the spell.\n\nThe perceptions of the banker were as keen, and his sense of security\nwas brief. Somehow, as he met the searching eye of the rector, he\nwas unable to see the man as a visionary, but beheld--and, to do him\njustice--felt a twinge of respect for an adversary worthy of his steel.\n\nHe, who was accustomed to prepare for clouds when they were mere specks\non his horizon, paused even now to marvel why he had not dealt with\nthis. Here was a man--a fanatic, if he liked--but still a man who\npositively did not fear him, to whom his wrath and power were as\nnothing! A new and startling and complicated sensation--but Eldon Parr\nwas no coward. If he had, consciously or unconsciously, formerly looked\nupon the clergyman as a dependent, Hodder appeared to be one no more.\nThe very ruggedness of the man had enhanced, expanded--as it were--until\nit filled the room. And Hodder had, with an audacity unparalleled in the\nbanker's experience arraigned by implication his whole life, managed to\nput him on the defensive.\n\n\"But if that be your experience,\" the rector said, \"and it has become\nyour philosophy, what is it in you that impels you to give these large\nsums for the public good?\"\n\n\"I should suppose that you, as a clergyman, might understand that my\nmotive is a Christian one.\"\n\nHodder sat very still, but a higher light came into his eyes.\n\n\"Mr. Parr,\" he replied, \"I have been a friend of yours, and I am a\nfriend still. And what I am going to tell you is not only in the hope\nthat others may benefit, but that your own soul may be saved. I mean\nthat literally--your own soul. You are under the impression that you are\na Christian, but you are not and never have been one. And you will\nnot be one until your whole life is transformed, until you become a\ndifferent man. If you do not change, it is my duty to warn you that the\nsorrow and suffering, the uneasiness which you now know, and which drive\nyou on, in search of distraction, to adding useless sums of money to\nyour fortune--this suffering, I say, will become intensified. You will\ndie in the knowledge of it, and live on after, in the knowledge of it.\"\n\nIn spite of himself, the financier drew back before this unexpected\nblast, the very intensity of which had struck a chill of terror in his\ninmost being. He had been taken off his guard,--for he had supposed the\nday long past--if it had ever existed--when a spiritual rebuke would\nupset him; the day long past when a minister could pronounce one with\nany force. That the Church should ever again presume to take herself\nseriously had never occurred to him. And yet--the man had denounced\nhim in a moment of depression, of nervous irritation and exasperation\nagainst a government which had begun to interfere with the sacred\nliberty of its citizens, against political agitators who had spurred\nthat government on. The world was mad. No element, it seemed, was now\ncontent to remain in its proper place. His voice, as he answered, shook\nwith rage,--all the greater because the undaunted sternness by which it\nwas confronted seemed to reduce it to futility.\n\n\"Take care!\" he cried, \"take care! You, nor any other man, clergyman or\nno clergyman, have any right to be the judge of my conduct.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Holder, \"if your conduct affects the welfare,\nthe progress, the reputation of the church of which I am rector, I have\nthe right. And I intend to exercise it. It becomes my duty, however\npainful, to tell you, as a member of the Church, wherein you have\nwronged the Church and wronged yourself.\"\n\nHe didn't raise his tone, and there was in it more of sorrow than of\nindignation. The banker turned an ashen gray.. A moment elapsed before\nhe spoke, a transforming moment. He suddenly became ice.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said. \"I can't pretend to account for these astounding\nviews you have acquired--and I am using a mild term. Let me say this:\n(he leaned forward a little, across the desk) I demand that you be\nspecific. I am a busy man, I have little time to waste, I have certain\nmatters--before me which must be attended to to-night. I warn you that I\nwill not listen any longer to vague accusations.\"\n\nIt was Holder's turn to marvel. Did Eldon Purr, after all; have no sense\nof guilt? Instantaneously, automatically, his own anger rose.\n\n\"You may be sure, Mr. Parr, that I should not be here unless I were\nprepared to be specific. And what I am going to say to you I have\nreserved for your ear alone, in the hope that you will take it to heart,\nwhile it is not yet too late, said amend your life accordingly.\"\n\nEldon Parr shifted slightly. His look became inscrutable, was riveted on\nthe rector.\n\n\"I shall call your attention first to a man of whom you have probably\nnever heard. He is dead now--he threw himself into the river this\nsummer, with a curse on his lips--I am afraid--a curse against you. A\nfew years ago he lived happily with his wife and child in a little house\non the Grade Suburban, and he had several thousand dollars as a result\nof careful saving and systematic self-denial.\n\n\"Perhaps you have never thought of the responsibilities of a great name.\nThis man, like thousands of others in the city, idealized you. He looked\nup to you as the soul of honour, as a self-made man who by his own\nunaided efforts--as you yourself have just pointed out--rose from a\npoor boy to a position of power and trust in the community. He saw you a\nprominent layman in the Church of God. He was dazzled by the\nbrilliancy of your success, inspired by a civilization which--gave such\nopportunities. He recognized that he himself had not the brains for\nsuch an achievement,--his hope and love and ambition were centred in his\nboy.\"\n\nAt the word Eldon Parr's glance was suddenly dulled by pain. He\ntightened his lips.\n\n\"That boy was then of a happy, merry disposition, so the mother says,\nand every summer night as she cooked supper she used to hear him\nlaughing as he romped in the yard with his father. When I first saw him\nthis summer, it was two days before his father committed suicide. The\nchild was lying, stifled with the heat, in the back room of one of those\ndesolate lodging houses in Dalton Street, and his little body had almost\nwasted away.\n\n\"While I was there the father came in, and when he saw me he was filled\nwith fury. He despised the Church, and St. John's above all churches,\nbecause you were of it; because you who had given so generously to\nit had wrecked his life. You had shattered his faith in humanity,\nhis ideal. From a normal, contented man he had deteriorated into a\nmonomaniac whom no one would hire, a physical and mental wreck who\nneeded care and nursing. He said he hoped the boy would die.\n\n\"And what had happened? The man had bought, with all the money he had\nin the world, Consolidated Tractions. He had bought it solely because\nof his admiration for your ability, his faith in your name. It was\ninconceivable to him that a man of your standing, a public benefactor,\na supporter of church and charities, would permit your name to be\nconnected with any enterprise that was not sound and just. Thousands\nlike Garvin lost all they had, while you are still a rich man. It is\nfurther asserted that you sold out all your stock at a high price, with\nthe exception of that in the leased lines, which are guaranteed heavy\ndividends.\"\n\n\"Have you finished?\" demanded Eldon Parr.\n\n\"Not quite, on this subject,\" replied the rector. \"Two nights after\nthat, the man threw himself in the river. His body was pulled out by men\non a tugboat, and his worthless stock certificate was in his pocket. It\nis now in the possession of Mr. Horace Bentley. Thanks to Mr. Bentley,\nthe widow found a temporary home, and the child has almost recovered.\"\n\nHodder paused. His interest had suddenly become concentrated upon the\nbanker's new demeanour, and he would not have thought it within the\nrange of possibility that a man could listen to such a revelation\nconcerning himself without the betrayal of some feeling. But so it\nwas,--Eldon Parr had been coldly attentive, save for the one scarcely\nperceptible tremor when the boy was mentioned. His interrogatory gesture\ngave the very touch of perfection to this attitude, since it proclaimed\nhim to have listened patiently to a charge so preposterous that a less\nreasonable man would have cut it short.\n\n\"And what leads you to suppose,\" he inquired, \"that I am responsible\nin this matter? What leads you to infer that the Consolidated Tractions\nCompany was not organized in good faith? Do you think that business men\nare always infallible? The street-car lines of this city were at\nsixes and sevens, fighting each other; money was being wasted by poor\nmanagement. The idea behind the company was a public-spirited one,\nto give the citizens cheaper and better service, by a more modern\nequipment, by a wider system of transfer. It seems to me, Mr. Hodder,\nthat you put yourself in a more quixotic position than the so-called\nreformers when you assume that the men who organize a company in good\nfaith are personally responsible for every share of stock that is sold,\nand for the welfare of every individual who may buy the stock. We force\nno one to buy it. They do so at their own risk. I myself have thousands\nof dollars of worthless stock in my safe. I have never complained.\"\n\nThe full force of Hodder's indignation went into his reply.\n\n\"I am not talking about the imperfect code of human justice under which\nwe live, Mr. Parr,\" he cried. \"This is not a case in which a court of\nlaw may exonerate you, it is between you and your God. But I have taken\nthe trouble to find out, from unquestioned sources, the truth about\nthe Consolidated Tractions Company--I shall not go into the details at\nlength--they are doubtless familiar to you. I know that the legal genius\nof Mr. Langmaid, one of my vestry, made possible the organization of the\ncompany, and thereby evaded the plain spirit of the law of the state. I\nknow that one branch line was bought for two hundred and fifty thousand\ndollars, and capitalized for three millions, and that most of the\nothers were scandalously over-capitalized. I know that while the coming\ntransaction was still a secret, you and other, gentlemen connected with\nthe matter bought up large interests in other lines, which you proceeded\nto lease to yourselves at guaranteed dividends which these lines do not\nearn. I know that the first large dividend was paid out of capital. And\nthe stock which you sold to poor Garvin was so hopelessly watered that\nit never could have been anything but worthless. If, in spite of these\nfacts, you do not deem yourself responsible for the misery which has\nbeen caused, if your conscience is now clear, it is my duty to tell you\nthat there is a higher bar of justice.\"\n\nThe intensity of the fire of the denunciation had, indeed, a momentary\nyet visible effect in the banker's expression. Whatever the emotions\nthus lashed to self-betrayal, anger, hatred,--fear, perhaps, Hodder\ncould not detect a trace of penitence; and he was aware, on the part of\nthe other, of a supreme, almost spasmodic effort for self-control. The\nconstitutional reluctance of Eldon Parr to fight openly could not have\nbeen more clearly demonstrated.\n\n\"Because you are a clergyman, Mr. Hodder,\" he began, \"because you are\nthe rector of St. John's, I have allowed you to say things to me which\nI would not have permitted from any other man. I have tried to take\ninto account your point of view, which is naturally restricted, your\npardonable ignorance of what business men, who wish to do their duty by\nChurch and State, have to contend with. When you came to this parish\nyou seemed to have a sensible, a proportional view of things; you were\ncontent to confine your activities to your own sphere, content not to\nmeddle with politics and business, which you could, at first hand, know\nnothing about. The modern desire of clergymen to interfere in these\nmatters has ruined the usefulness of many of them.\n\n\"I repeat, I have tried to be patient. I venture to hope, still, that\nthis extraordinary change in you may not be permanent, but merely the\nresult of a natural sympathy with the weak and unwise and unfortunate\nwho are always to be found in a complex civilization. I can even\nconceive how such a discovery must have shocked you, temporarily aroused\nyour indignation, as a clergyman, against the world as it is--and, I\nmay add, as it has always been. My personal friendship for you, and my\ninterest in your future welfare impel me to make a final appeal to you\nnot to ruin a career which is full of promise.\"\n\nThe rector did not take advantage of the pause. A purely psychological\ncuriosity hypnotized him to see how far the banker would go in his\napparent generosity.\n\n\"I once heard you say, I believe, in a sermon, that the Christian\nreligion is a leaven. It is the leaven that softens and ameliorates the\nhard conditions of life, that makes our relations with our fellow-men\nbearable. But life is a contest, it is war. It always has been, and\nalways will be. Business is war, commerce is war, both among nations and\nindividuals. You cannot get around it. If a man does not exterminate his\nrivals they will exterminate him. In other days churches were built and\nendowed with the spoils of war, and did not disdain the money. To-day\nthey cheerfully accept the support and gifts of business men. I do\nnot accuse them of hypocrisy. It is a recognition on their part that\nbusiness men, in spite of hard facts, are not unmindful of the spiritual\nside of life, and are not deaf to the injunction to help others.\nAnd when, let me ask you, could you find in the world's history more\nsplendid charities than are around us to-day? Institutions endowed\nfor medical research, for the conquest of deadly diseases? libraries,\nhospitals, schools--men giving their fortunes for these things, the\nfruits of a life's work so laboriously acquired? Who can say that the\nmodern capitalist is not liberal, is not a public benefactor?\n\n\"I dislike being personal, but you have forced it upon me. I dislike\nto refer to what I have already done in the matter of charities, but\nI hinted to you awhile ago of a project I have conceived and almost\nperfected of gifts on a much larger scale than I have ever attempted.\"\nThe financier stared at him meaningly. \"And I had you in mind as one of\nthe three men whom I should consult, whom I should associate with\nmyself in the matter. We cannot change human nature, but we can better\nconditions by wise giving. I do not refer now to the settle ment house,\nwhich I am ready to help make and maintain as the best in the country,\nbut I have in mind a system to be carried out with the consent and aid\nof the municipal government, of play-grounds, baths, parks, places of\nrecreation, and hospitals, for the benefit of the people, which will\nput our city in the very forefront of progress. And I believe, as a\npractical man, I can convince you that the betterment which you and I\nso earnestly desire can be brought about in no other way. Agitation can\nonly result in anarchy and misery for all.\"\n\nHodder's wrath, as he rose from his chair, was of the sort that appears\nincredibly to add to the physical stature,--the bewildering spiritual\nwrath which is rare indeed, and carries all before it.\n\n\"Don't tempt me, Mr. Parr!\" he said. \"Now that I know the truth, I tell\nyou frankly I would face poverty and persecution rather than consent\nto your offer. And I warn you once more not to flatter yourself that\nexistence ends here, that you will, not be called to answer for every\nwrong act you have committed in accumulating your fortune, that what you\ncall business is an affair of which God takes no account. What I say\nmay seem foolishness to you, but I tell you, in the words of that\nFoolishness, that it will not profit you to gain the whole world and\nlose your own soul. You remind me that the Church in old time accepted\ngifts from the spoils of war, and I will add of rapine and murder. And\nthe Church to-day, to repeat your own parallel, grows rich with money\nwrongfully got. Legally? Ah, yes, legally, perhaps. But that will not\navail you. And the kind of church you speak of--to which I, to my shame,\nonce consented--Our Lord repudiates. It is none of his. I warn you, Mr.\nParr, in his Name, first to make your peace with your brothers before\nyou presume to lay another gift on the altar.\"\n\nDuring this withering condemnation of himself Eldon Parr sat motionless,\nhis face grown livid, an expression on it that continued to haunt Hodder\nlong afterwards. An expression, indeed, which made the banker almost\nunrecognizable.\n\n\"Go,\" he whispered, his hand trembling visibly as he pointed towards the\ndoor. \"Go--I have had enough of this.\"\n\n\"Not until I have said one thing more,\" replied the rector, undaunted.\n\"I have found the woman whose marriage with your son you prevented,\nwhom you bought off and started on the road to hell without any sense\nof responsibility. You have made of her a prostitute and a drunkard.\nWhether she can be rescued or not is problematical. She, too, is in\nMr. Bentley's care, a man upon whom you once showed no mercy. I leave\nGarvin, who has gone to his death, and Kate Marcy and Horace Bentley to\nyour conscience, Mr. Parr. That they are representative of many others,\nI do not doubt. I tell you solemnly that the whole meaning of life is\nservice to others, and I warn you, before it is too late, to repent and\nmake amends. Gifts will not help you, and charities are of no avail.\"\n\nAt the reference to Kate Marcy Eldon Parr's hand dropped to his side. He\nseemed to have physical difficulty in speaking.\n\n\"Ah, you have found that woman!\" He leaned an elbow on the desk, he\nseemed suddenly to have become weary, spent, old. And Hodder, as he\nwatched him, perceived--that his haggard look was directed towards a\nphotograph in a silver frame on the table--a photograph of Preston Parr.\nAt length he broke the silence.\n\n\"What would you have had me do?\" he asked. \"Permit my son to marry a\nwoman of the streets, I suppose. That would have been Christianity,\naccording to your notion. Come now, what world you have done, if your\nson had been in question?\"\n\nA wave of pity swept over the rector.\n\n\"Why,\" he said, why did you have nothing but cruelty in your heart, and\ncontempt for her? When you saw that she was willing, for the love of the\nson whom you loved, to give up all that life meant to her, how could\nyou destroy her without a qualm? The crime you committed was that you\nrefused to see God in that woman's soul, when he had revealed himself to\nyou. You looked for wile, for cunning, for self-seeking,--and they were\nnot there. Love had obliterated them. When you saw how meekly she\nobeyed you, and agreed to go away, why did you not have pity? If you had\nlistened to your conscience, you would have known what to do.\n\n\"I do not say that you should not have opposed the marriage--then.\nMarriage is not to be lightly entered into. From the moment you went to\nsee her you became responsible for her. You hurled her into the abyss,\nand she has come back to haunt you. You should have had her educated and\ncared for--she would have submitted, to any plan you proposed. And if,\nafter a sensible separation, you became satisfied as to her character\nand development, and your son still wished to marry her, you should have\nwithdrawn your objections.\n\n\"As it is, and in consequence of your act, you have lost your son. He\nleft you then, and you have no more control over him.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Eldon Parr, \"for God's sake stop! I won't stand any more\nof this. I will not listen to criticism of my life, to strictures on my\nconduct from you or any other man.\" He reached for a book on the corner\nof his desk--a cheque book.--\"You'll want money for these people, I\nsuppose,\" he added brutally. \"I will give it, but it must be understood\nthat I do not recognize any right of theirs to demand it.\"\n\nFor a moment Holder did not trust himself to reply. He looked down\nacross the desk at the financier, who was fumbling with the leaves.\n\n\"They do not demand it, Mr. Parr,\" he answered, gently. \"And I have\ntried to make it plain to you that you have lost the right to give it. I\nexpected to fail in this. I have failed.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Eldon Parr let the cheque book close.\n\n\"I mean what I said,\" the rector replied. \"That if you would save your\nsoul you must put an end, to-morrow, to the acquisition of money, and\ndevote the rest of your life to an earnest and sincere attempt to\nmake just restitution to those you have wronged. And you must ask the\nforgiveness of God for your sins. Until you do that, your charities are\nabominations in his sight. I will not trouble you any longer, except to\nsay that I shall be ready to come to you at any time my presence may be\nof any help to you.\"\n\nThe banker did not speak.... With a single glance towards the library\nHolder left the house, but paused for a moment outside to gaze back at\nit, as it loomed in the darkness against the stars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. ALISON GOES TO CHURCH\n\n\nI\n\nOn the following Sunday morning the early light filtered into Alison's\nroom, and she opened her strong eyes. Presently she sprang from her bed\nand drew back the curtains of the windows, gazing rapturously into the\ncrystal day. The verdure of the Park was freshened to an incredible\nbrilliancy by the dew, a thin white veil of mist was spread over the\nmirror of the waters, the trees flung long shadows across the turf.\n\nA few minutes later she was out, thrilled by the silence, drawing in\ndeep, breaths of the morning air; lingering by still lakes catching the\nblue of the sky--a blue that left its stain upon the soul; as the sun\nmounted she wandered farther, losing herself in the wilderness of the\nforest.\n\nAt eight o'clock, when she returned, there were signs that the city had\nawakened. A mounted policeman trotted past her as she crossed a gravel\ndrive, and on the tree-flecked stretches, which lately had been empty\nas Eden, human figures were scattered. A child, with a sailboat that\nlanguished for lack of wind, stared at her, first with fascination and\nwonder in his eyes, and then smiled at her tentatively. She returned the\nsmile with a start.\n\nChildren had stared at her like that before now, and for the first time\nin her life she asked herself what the look might mean. She had never\nreally been fond of them: she had never, indeed, been brought much in\ncontact with them. But now, without warning, a sudden fierce yearning\ntook possession of her: surprised and almost frightened, she stopped\nirresistibly and looked back at the thin little figure crouched beside\nthe water, to discover that his widened eyes were still upon her. Her\nown lingered on him shyly, and thus for a moment she hung in doubt\nwhether to flee or stay, her heart throbbing as though she were on the\nbrink of some unknown and momentous adventure. She took a timid step.\n\n\"What's your name?\" she asked.\n\nThe boy told her.\n\n\"What's yours?\" he ventured, still under the charm.\n\n\"Alison.\"\n\nHe had never heard of that name, and said so. They deplored the lack of\nwind. And presently, still mystified, but gathering courage, he asked\nher why she blushed, at which her colour deepened.\n\n\"I can't help it,\" she told him.\n\n\"I like it,\" the boy said.\n\nThough the grass was still wet, she got down on her knees in her white\nskirt, the better to push the boat along the shore: once it drifted\nbeyond their reach, and was only rescued by a fallen branch discovered\nwith difficulty.\n\nThe arrival of the boy's father, an anaemic-looking little man, put an\nend to their play. He deplored the condition of the lady's dress.\n\n\"It doesn't matter in the least,\" she assured him, and fled in a mood\nshe did not attempt to analyze. Hurrying homeward, she regained her\nroom, bathed, and at half past eight appeared in the big, formal\ndining-room, from which the glare of the morning light was carefully\nscreened. Her father insisted on breakfasting here; and she found him\nnow seated before the white table-cloth, reading a newspaper. He glanced\nup at her critically.\n\n\"So you've decided to honour me this morning,\" he said.\n\n\"I've been out in the Park,\" she replied, taking the chair opposite\nhim. He resumed his reading, but presently, as she was pouring out the\ncoffee, he lowered the paper again.\n\n\"What's the occasion to-day?\" he asked.\n\n\"The occasion?\" she repeated, without acknowledging that she had\ninstantly grasped his implication. His eyes were on her gown.\n\n\"You are not accustomed, as a rule, to pay much deference to Sunday.\"\n\n\"Doesn't the Bible say, somewhere,\" she inquired, \"that the Sabbath was\nmade for man? Perhaps that may be broadened after a while, to include\nwoman.\"\n\n\"But you have never been an advocate, so far as I know, of women taking\nadvantage of their opportunity by going to Church.\"\n\n\"What's the use,\" demanded Alison, \"of the thousands of working women\nspending the best part of the day in the ordinary church, when their\nfeet and hands and heads are aching? Unless some fire is kindled in\ntheir souls, it is hopeless for them to try to obtain any benefit from\nreligion--so-called--as it is preached to them in most churches.\"\n\n\"Fire in their souls!\" exclaimed the banker.\n\n\"Yes. If the churches offered those who might be leaders among their\nfellows a practical solution of existence, kindled their self-respect,\nreplaced a life of drudgery by one of inspiration--that would be worth\nwhile. But you will never get such a condition as that unless your\npulpits are filled by personalities, instead of puppets who are all cast\nin one mould, and who profess to be there by divine right.\"\n\n\"I am glad to see at least that you are taking an interest in religious\nmatters,\" her father observed, meaningly.\n\nAlison coloured. But she retorted with spirit.\n\n\"That is true of a great many persons to-day who are thinking on the\nsubject. If Christianity is a solution of life, people are demanding of\nthe churches that they shall perform their function, and show us how,\nand why, or else cease to encumber the world.\"\n\nEldon Parr folded up his newspaper.\n\n\"So you are going to Church this morning,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes. At what time will you be ready?\"\n\n\"At quarter to eleven. But if you are going to St. John', you will have\nto start earlier. I'll order a car at half past ten.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" She held her breath, unconsciously, for the\nanswer.\n\n\"To Calvary,\" he replied coldly, as he rose to leave the room. \"But I\nhesitate to ask you to come,--I am afraid you will not find a religion\nthere that suits you.\"\n\nFor a moment she could not trust herself to speak. The secret which,\never since Friday evening, she had been burning to learn was disclosed\n... Her father had broken with Mr. Hodder!\n\n\"Please don't order the motor for me,\" she said. \"I'd rather go in the\nstreet cars.\"\n\nShe sat very still in the empty room, her face burning.\n\nCharacteristically, her father had not once mentioned the rector of\nSt. John's, yet had contrived to imply that her interest in Hodder was\ngreater than her interest in religion. And she was forced to admit, with\nher customary honesty, that the implication was true.\n\n\nThe numbers who knew Alison Parr casually thought her cold. They admired\na certain quality in her work, but they did not suspect that that\nquality was the incomplete expression of an innate idealism capable\nof being fanned into flame,--for she was subject to rare but ardent\nenthusiasms which kindled and transformed her incredibly in the eyes of\nthe few to whom the process had been revealed. She had had even a longer\nlist of suitors than any one guessed; men who--usually by accident--had\ntouched the hidden spring, and suddenly beholding an unimagined woman,\nhad consequently lost their heads. The mistake most of them had made\n(for subtlety in such affairs is not a masculine trait) was the failure\nto recognize and continue to present the quality in them which had\nawakened her. She had invariably discovered the feet of clay.\n\nThus disillusion had been her misfortune--perhaps it would be more\naccurate to say her fortune. She had built up, after each invasion,\nher defences more carefully and solidly than before, only to be again\nastonished and dismayed by the next onslaught, until at length the\nquestion had become insistent--the question of an alliance for purposes\nof greater security. She had returned to her childhood home to consider\nit, frankly recognizing it as a compromise, a fall....\n\nAnd here, in this sanctuary of her reflection, and out of a quarter on\nwhich she had set no watch, out of a wilderness which she had believed\nto hold nothing save the ruined splendours of the past, had come one\nwho, like the traditional figures of the wilderness, had attracted her\nby his very uncouthness and latent power. And the anomaly he presented\nin what might be called the vehemence of his advocacy of an outworn\northodoxy, in his occupation of the pulpit of St. John's, had quickened\nat once her curiosity and antagonism. It had been her sudden discovery,\nor rather her instinctive suspicion of the inner conflict in him which\nhad set her standard fluttering in response. Once more (for the last\ntime--something whispered--now) she had become the lady of the lists;\nshe sat on her walls watching, with beating heart and straining eyes,\nthe closed helm of her champion, ready to fling down the revived remnant\nof her faith as prize or forfeit. She had staked all on the hope that he\nwould not lower his lance.....\n\nSaturday had passed in suspense.... And now was flooding in on her\nthe certainty that he had not failed her; that he had, with a sublime\nindifference to a worldly future and success, defied the powers. With\nindifference, too, to her! She knew, of course, that he loved her. A man\nwith less of greatness would have sought a middle way....\n\nWhen, at half past ten, she fared forth into the sunlight, she was\nfilled with anticipation, excitement, concern, feelings enhanced and not\nsoothed by the pulsing vibrations of the church bells in the softening\nair. The swift motion of the electric car was grateful... But at length\nthe sight of familiar landmarks, old-fashioned dwellings crowded in\nbetween the stores and factories of lower Tower Street, brought back\nrecollections of the days when she had come this way, other Sunday\nmornings, and in a more leisurely public vehicle, with her mother.\nWas it possible that she, Alison Parr, were going to church now? Her\nexcitement deepened, and she found it difficult to bring herself to\nthe realization that her destination was a church--the church of her\nchildhood. At this moment she could only think of St. John's as the\nsetting of the supreme drama.\n\nWhen she alighted at the corner of Burton Street there was the\nwell-remembered, shifting group on the pavement in front of the church\nporch. How many times, in the summer and winter, in fair weather and\ncloudy, in rain and sleet and snow had she approached that group, as she\napproached it now! Here were the people, still, in the midst of whom\nher earliest associations had been formed, changed, indeed,-but yet the\nsame. No, the change was in her, and the very vastness of that change\ncame as a shock. These had stood still, anchored to their traditions,\nwhile she--had she grown? or merely wandered? She had searched, at\nleast, and seen. She had once accepted them--if indeed as a child it\ncould have been said of her that she accepted anything; she had been\nunable then, at any rate, to bring forward any comparisons.\n\nNow she beheld them, collectively, in their complacent finery, as\nrepresenting a force, a section of the army blocking the heads of the\npasses of the world's progress, resting on their arms, but ready at the\nleast uneasy movement from below to man the breastworks, to fling down\nthe traitor from above, to fight fiercely for the solidarity of\ntheir order. And Alison even believed herself to detect, by something\nindefinable in their attitudes as they stood momentarily conversing\nin lowered voices, an aroused suspicion, an uneasy anticipation. Her\nimagination went so far as to apprehend, as they greeted her unwonted\nappearance, that they read in it an addition to other vague and\ndisturbing phenomena. Her colour was high.\n\n\"Why, my dear,\" said Mrs. Atterbury, \"I thought you had gone back to New\nYork long ago!\"\n\nBeside his mother stood Gordon--more dried up, it seemed, than ever.\nAlison recalled him, as on this very spot, a thin, pale boy in short\ntrousers, and Mrs. Atterbury a beautiful and controlled young matron\nassociated with St. John's and with children's parties. She was\nwonderful yet, with her white hair and straight nose, her erect figure\nstill slight. Alison knew that Mrs. Atterbury had never forgiven her\nfor rejecting her son--or rather for being the kind of woman who could\nreject him.\n\n\"Surely you haven't been here all summer?\"\n\nAlison admitted it, characteristically, without explanations.\n\n\"It seems so natural to see you here at the old church, after all these\nyears,\" the lady went on, and Alison was aware that Mrs. Atterbury\nquestioned--or rather was at a loss for the motives which had led such\nan apostate back to the fold. \"We must thank Mr. Hodder, I suppose. He's\nvery remarkable. I hear he is resuming the services to-day for the first\ntime since June.\"\n\nAlison was inclined to read a significance into Mrs. Atterbury's glance\nat her son, who was clearing his throat.\n\n\"But--where is Mr. Parr?\" he asked. \"I understand he has come back from\nhis cruise.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is back. I came without--him---as you see.\"\n\nShe found a certain satisfaction in adding to the mystification, to the\ndisquietude he betrayed by fidgeting more than usual.\n\n\"But--he always comes when he is in town. Business--I suppose--ahem!\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Alison, dropping her bomb with cruel precision, \"he has\ngone to Calvary.\"\n\nThe agitation was instantaneous.\n\n\"To Calvary!\" exclaimed mother and son in one breath.\n\n\"Why?\" It was Gordon who demanded. \"A--a special occasion there--a\nbishop or something?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you must ask him,\" she said.\n\nShe was delayed on the steps, first by Nan Ferguson, then by the\nLaureston Greys, and her news outdistanced her to the porch. Charlotte\nPlimpton looking very red and solid, her eyes glittering with\nexcitement, blocked her way.\n\n\"Alison?\" she cried, in the slightly nasal voice that was a Gore\ninheritance, \"I'm told your father's gone to Calvary! Has Mr. Hodder\noffended him? I heard rumours--Wallis seems to be afraid that something\nhas happened.\"\n\n\"He hasn't said anything about it to me, Charlotte,\" said Alison, in\nquiet amusement, \"but then he wouldn't, you know. I don't live here\nany longer, and he has no reason to think that I would be interested in\nchurch matters.\"\n\n\"But--why did you come?\" Charlotte demanded, with Gore naivete.\n\nAlison smiled.\n\n\"You mean--what was my motive?\"\n\nCharlotte actually performed the miracle of getting redder. She was\nafraid of Alison--much more afraid since she had known of her vogue in\nthe East. When Alison had put into execution the astounding folly (to\nthe Gore mind) of rejecting the inheritance of millions to espouse\na profession, it had been Charlotte Plimpton who led the chorus of\nridicule and disapproval. But success, to the Charlotte Plimptons, is\nits own justification, and now her ambition (which had ramifications)\nwas to have Alison \"do\" her a garden. Incidentally, the question had\nflashed through her mind as to how much Alison's good looks had helped\ntowards her triumph in certain shining circles.\n\n\"Oh, of course I didn't mean that,\" she hastened to deny, although\nit was exactly what she had meant. Her curiosity unsatisfied--and\nnot likely to be satisfied at once, she shifted abruptly to the other\nburning subject. \"I was so glad when I learned you hadn't gone. Grace\nLarrabbee's garden is a dream, my dear. Wallis and I stopped there the\nother day and the caretaker showed it to us. Can't you make a plan for\nme, so that I may begin next spring? And there's something else I wanted\nto ask you. Wallis and I are going to New York the end of the month.\nShall you be there?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Alison, cautiously.\n\n\"We want so much to see one or two of your gardens on Long Island, and\nespecially the Sibleys', on the Hudson. I know it will be late in the\nseason,--but don't you think you could take us, Alison? And I intend to\ngive you a dinner. I'll write you a note. Here's Wallis.\"\n\n\"Well, well, well,\" said Mr. Plimpton, shaking Alison's hand. \"Where's\nfather? I hear he's gone to Calvary.\"\n\nAlison made her escape. Inside the silent church, Eleanor Goodrich gave\nher a smile and a pressure of welcome. Beside her, standing behind the\nrear pew, were Asa Waring and--Mr. Bentley! Mr. Bentley returned to St.\nJohn's!\n\n\"You have come!\" Alison whispered.\n\nHe understood her. He took her hand in his and looked down into her\nupturned face.\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" he said, \"and my girls have come Sally Grover and the\nothers, and some friends from Dalton Street and elsewhere.\"\n\nThe news, the sound of this old gentleman's voice and the touch of his\nhand suddenly filled her with a strange yet sober happiness. Asa Waring,\nthough he had not overheard, smiled at her too, as in sympathy. His\naustere face was curiously illuminated, and she knew instinctively that\nin some way he shared her happiness. Mr. Bentley had come back! Yes, it\nwas an augury. From childhood she had always admired Asa Waring, and now\nshe felt a closer tie....\n\nShe reached the pew, hesitated an instant, and slipped forward on her\nknees. Years had gone by since she had prayed, and even now she made no\nattempt to translate into words the intensity of her yearning--for what?\nHodder's success, for one thing,--and by success she meant that he might\npursue an unfaltering course. True to her temperament, she did not\nlook for the downfall of the forces opposed to him. She beheld him\npersecuted, yet unyielding, and was thus lifted to an exaltation\nthat amazed... If he could do it, such a struggle must sorely have an\nultimate meaning! Thus she found herself, trembling, on the borderland\nof faith...\n\nShe arose, bewildered, her pulses beating. And presently glancing about,\nshe took in that the church was fuller than she ever remembered having\nseen it, and the palpitating suspense she felt seemed to pervade, as\nit were, the very silence. With startling abruptness, the silence was\nbroken by the tones of the great organ that rolled and reverberated\namong the arches; distant voices took up the processional; the white\nchoir filed past,--first the treble voices of the boys, then the deeper\nnotes of the--men,--turned and mounted the chancel steps, and then she\nsaw Hodder. Her pew being among the first, he passed very near her.\nDid he know she would be there? The sternness of his profile told her\nnothing. He seemed at that moment removed, set apart, consecrated--this\nwas the word that came to her, and yet she was keenly conscious of his\npresence.\n\nTingling, she found herself repeating, inwardly, two, lines of the hymn\n\n          \"Lay hold on life, and it shall be\n          Thy joy and crown eternally.\"\n\n\"Lay hold on life!\"\n\nThe service began,--the well-remembered, beautiful appeal and prayers\nwhich she could still repeat, after a lapse of time, almost by heart;\nand their music and rhythm, the simple yet magnificent language in\nwhich they were clothed--her own language--awoke this morning a\nracial instinct strong in her,--she had not known how strong. Or was it\nsomething in Hodder's voice that seemed to illumine the ancient words\nwith a new meaning? Raising her eyes to the chancel she studied his\nhead, and found in it still another expression of that race, the history\nof which had been one of protest, of development of its own character\nand personality. Her mind went back to her first talk with him, in the\ngarden, and she saw how her intuition had recognized in him then the\nspirit of a people striving to assert itself.\n\nShe stood with tightened lips, during the Apostles' Creed, listening to\nhis voice as it rose, strong and unfaltering, above the murmur of the\ncongregation.\n\nAt last she saw him swiftly crossing the chancel, mounting the pulpit\nsteps, and he towered above her, a dominant figure, his white surplice\nsharply outlined against the dark stone of the pillar. The hymn died\naway, the congregation sat down. There was a sound in the church,\nexpectant, presaging, like the stirring of leaves at the first breath of\nwind, and then all was silent.\n\n\n\nII\n\nHe had preached for an hour--longer, perhaps. Alison could not have said\nhow long. She had lost all sense of time.\n\nNo sooner had the text been spoken, \"Except a man be born again, he\ncannot see the Kingdom of God,\" than she seemed to catch a fleeting\nglimpse of an hitherto unimagined Personality. Hundreds of times she\nhad heard those words, and they had been as meaningless to her as\nto Nicodemus. But now--now something was brought home to her of the\nmagnificent certainty with which they must first have been spoken, of\nthe tone and bearing and authority of him who had uttered them. Was\nChrist like that? And could it be a Truth, after all, a truth only to be\ngrasped by one who had experienced it?\n\nIt was in vain that man had tried to evade this, the supreme revelation\nof Jesus Christ, had sought to substitute ceremonies and sacrifices for\nspiritual rebirth. It was in vain that the Church herself had, from time\nto time, been inclined to compromise. St. Paul, once the strict Pharisee\nwho had laboured for the religion of works, himself had been reborn into\nthe religion of the Spirit. It was Paul who had liberated that message\nof rebirth, which the world has been so long in grasping, from the\nnarrow bounds of Palestine and sent it ringing down the ages to the\ndemocracies of the twentieth century.\n\nAnd even Paul, though not consciously inconsistent, could not rid\nhimself completely of that ancient, automatic, conception of religion\nwhich the Master condemned, but had on occasions attempted fruitlessly\nto unite the new with the old. And thus, for a long time, Christianity\nhad been wrongly conceived as history, beginning with what to Paul and\nthe Jews was an historical event, the allegory of the Garden of\nEden, the fall of Adam, and ending with the Jewish conception of the\nAtonement. This was a rationalistic and not a spiritual religion.\n\nThe miracle was not the vision, whatever its nature, which Saul beheld\non the road to Damascus. The miracle was the result of that vision, the\nman reborn. Saul, the persecutor of Christians, become Paul, who spent\nthe rest of his days, in spite of persecution and bodily infirmities,\njourneying tirelessly up and down the Roman Empire, preaching the\nrisen Christ, and labouring more abundantly than they all! There was no\nmiracle in the New Testament more wonderful than this.\n\nThe risen Christ! Let us not trouble ourselves about the psychological\nproblems involved, problems which the first century interpreted in its\nown simple way. Modern, science has taught us this much, at least,\nthat we have by no means fathomed the limits even of a transcendent\npersonality. If proofs of the Resurrection and Ascension were demanded,\nlet them be spiritual proofs, and there could be none more convincing\nthan the life of the transformed Saul, who had given to the modern,\nwestern world the message of salvation....\n\nThat afternoon, as Alison sat motionless on a distant hillside of the\nPark, gazing across the tree-dotted, rolling country to the westward,\nshe recalled the breathless silence in the church when he had reached\nthis point and paused, looking down at the congregation. By the subtle\ntransmission of thought, of feeling which is characteristic at dramatic\nmoments of bodies of people, she knew that he had already contrived\nto stir them to the quick. It was not so much that these opening words\nmight have been startling to the strictly orthodox, but the added fact\nthat Hodder had uttered them. The sensation in the pews, as Alison\ninterpreted it and exulted over it, was one of bewildered amazement that\nthis was their rector, the same man who had preached to them in June.\nLike Paul, of whom he spoke, he too was transformed, had come to his\nown, radiating a new power that seemed to shine in his face.\n\nStill agitated, she considered that discourse now in her solitude,\nwhat it meant for him, for her, for the Church and civilization that\na clergyman should have had the courage to preach it. He himself had\nseemed unconscious of any courage; had never once--she recalled--been\nsensational. He had spoken simply, even in the intensest moments of\ndenunciation. And she wondered now how he had managed, without stripping\nhimself, without baring the intimate, sacred experiences of his own\nsoul, to convey to them, so nobly, the change which had taken place in\nhim....\n\nHe began by referring to the hope with which he had come to St. John's,\nand the gradual realization that the church was a failure--a dismal\nfailure when compared to the high ideal of her Master. By her fruits she\nshould be known and judged. From the first he had contemplated, with a\nheavy heart, the sin and misery at their very gates. Not three blocks\ndistant children were learning vice in the streets, little boys of seven\nand eight, underfed and anaemic, were driven out before dawn to sell\nnewspapers, little girls thrust forth to haunt the saloons and beg,\nwhile their own children were warmed and fed. While their own daughters\nwere guarded, young women in Dayton Street were forced to sell\nthemselves into a life which meant slow torture, inevitable early death.\nHopeless husbands and wives were cast up like driftwood by the cruel,\nresistless flood of modern civilization--the very civilization which\nyielded their wealth and luxury. The civilization which professed the\nSpirit of Christ, and yet was pitiless.\n\nHe confessed to them that for a long time he had been blind to the\ntruth, had taken the inherited, unchristian view that the disease which\ncaused vice and poverty might not be cured, though its ulcers might be\nalleviated. He had not, indeed, clearly perceived and recognized the\ndisease. He had regarded Dalton Street in a very special sense as a\nreproach to St. John's, but now he saw that all such neighbourhoods were\nin reality a reproach to the city, to the state, to the nation. True\nChristianity and Democracy were identical, and the congregation of St.\nJohn's, as professed Christians and citizens, were doubly responsible,\ninasmuch as they not only made no protest or attempt to change a\ngovernment which permitted the Dalton Streets to exist, but inasmuch\nalso as,--directly or indirectly,--they derived a profit from conditions\nwhich were an abomination to God. It would be but an idle mockery for\nthem to go and build a settlement house, if they did not first reform\ntheir lives.\n\nHere there had been a decided stir among the pews. Hodder had not seemed\nto notice it.\n\nWhen he, their rector, had gone to Dalton Street to invite the poor and\nwretched into God's Church, he was met by the scornful question: \"Are\nthe Christians of the churches any better than we? Christians own the\ngrim tenements in which we live, the saloons and brothels by which\nwe are surrounded, which devour our children. Christians own the\nestablishments which pay us starvation wages; profit by politics, and\ntake toll from our very vice; evade the laws and reap millions, while we\nare sent to jail. Is their God a God who will lift us out of our misery\nand distress? Are their churches for the poor? Are not the very pews in\nwhich they sit as closed to us as their houses?\"\n\n\"I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would thou wert\ncold or hot.\"\n\nOne inevitable conclusion of such a revelation was that he had not\npreached to them the vital element of Christianity. And the very\nfact that his presentation of religion had left many indifferent or\ndissatisfied was proof-positive that he had dwelt upon non-essentials,\nlaid emphasis upon the mistaken interpretations of past ages. There\nwere those within the Church who were content with this, who--like the\nPharisees of old--welcomed a religion which did not interfere with\ntheir complacency, with their pursuit of pleasure and wealth, with\ntheir special privileges; welcomed a Church which didn't raise her voice\nagainst the manner of their lives--against the order, the Golden\nCalf which they had set up, which did not accuse them of deliberately\nretarding the coming of the Kingdom of God.\n\nAh, that religion was not religion, for religion was a spiritual, not\na material affair. In that religion, vainly designed by man as a\ncompromise between God and Mammon, there was none of the divine\ndiscontent of the true religion of the Spirit, no need of the rebirth\nof the soul. And those who held it might well demand, with Nicodemus and\nthe rulers of the earth, \"How can these things be?\"\n\nAnd there were others who still lingered in the Church, perplexed and\nwistful, who had come to him and confessed that the so-called catholic\nacceptance of divine truths, on which he had hitherto dwelt, meant\nnothing to them. To these, in particular, he owed a special reparation,\nand he took this occasion to announce a series of Sunday evening sermons\non the Creeds. So long as the Creeds remained in the Prayer Book it was\nhis duty to interpret them in terms not only of modern thought, but in\nharmony with the real significance of the Person and message of Jesus\nChrist. Those who had come to him questioning, he declared, were a\nthousand times right in refusing to accept the interpretations of other\nmen, the consensus of opinion of more ignorant ages, expressed in an\nancient science and an archaic philosophy.\n\nAnd what should be said of the vast and ever increasing numbers of those\nnot connected with the Church, who had left it or were leaving it? and\nof the less fortunate to whose bodily wants they had been ministering\nin the parish house, for whom it had no spiritual message, and who never\nentered its doors? The necessity of religion, of getting in touch with,\nof dependence on the Spirit of the Universe was inherent in man, and yet\nthere were thousands--nay, millions in the nation to-day in whose hearts\nwas an intense and unsatisfied yearning, who perceived no meaning in\nlife, no Cause for which to work, who did not know what Christianity\nwas, who had never known what it was, who wist not where to turn to\nfind out. Education had brought many of them to discern, in the Church's\nteachings, an anachronistic medley of myths and legends, of theories of\nschoolmen and theologians, of surviving pagan superstitions which\ncould not be translated into life. They saw, in Christianity, only\nthe adulterations of the centuries. If any one needed a proof of the\nyearning people felt, let him go to the bookshops, or read in the\npublishers' lists to-day the announcements of books on religion. There\nwas no supply where there was no demand.\n\nTruth might no longer be identified with Tradition, and the day was past\nwhen councils and synods might determine it for all mankind. The era of\nforced acceptance of philosophical doctrines and dogmas was past,\nand that of freedom, of spiritual rebirth, of vicarious suffering, of\nwilling sacrifice and service for a Cause was upon them. That cause was\nDemocracy. Christ was uniquely the Son of God because he had lived and\nsuffered and died in order to reveal to the world the meaning of this\nlife and of the hereafter--the meaning not only for the individual, but\nfor society as well. Nothing might be added to or subtracted from that\nmessage--it was complete.\n\nTrue faith was simply trusting--trusting that Christ gave to the world\nthe revelation of God's plan. And the Saviour himself had pointed out\nthe proof: \"If any man do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,\nwhether it be of God, or whether I speak for myself.\" Christ had\nrepeatedly rebuked those literal minds which had demanded material\nevidence: true faith spurned it, just as true friendship, true love\nbetween man and man, true trust scorned a written bond. To paraphrase\nSt. James's words, faith without trust is dead--because faith without\ntrust is impossible. God is a Spirit, only to be recognized in the\nSpirit, and every one of the Saviour's utterances were--not of the\nflesh, of the man--but of the Spirit within him. \"He that hath seen me\nhath seen the Father;\" and \"Why callest thou me good? none is good save\none, that is, God.\" The Spirit, the Universal Meaning of Life, incarnate\nin the human Jesus.\n\nTo be born again was to overcome our spiritual blindness, and then, and\nthen only, we might behold the spirit shining in the soul of Christ.\nThat proof had sufficed for Mark, had sufficed for the writer of the\nsublime Fourth Gospel, had sufficed for Paul. Let us lift this\nwondrous fact, once and for all, out of the ecclesiastical setting and\nincorporate it into our lives. Nor need the hearts of those who seek the\nTruth, who fear not to face it, be troubled if they be satisfied, from\nthe Gospels, that the birth of Jesus was not miraculous. The physical\nnever could prove the spiritual, which was the real and everlasting,\nwhich no discovery in science or history can take from us. The Godship\nof Christ rested upon no dogma, it was a conviction born into us with\nthe new birth. And it becomes an integral part of our personality, our\nvery being.\n\nThe secret, then, lay in a presentation of the divine message which\nwould convince and transform and electrify those who heard it to\naction--a presentation of the message in terms which the age could\ngrasp. That is what Paul had done, he had drawn his figures boldly\nfrom the customs of the life of his day, but a more or less intimate\nknowledge of these ancient customs were necessary before modern men and\nwomen could understand those figures and parallels. And the Church must\nawake to her opportunities, to her perception of the Cause....\n\nWhat, then, was the function, the mission of the Church Universal? Once\nshe had laid claim to temporal power, believed herself to be the sole\nagency of God on earth, had spoken ex cathedra on philosophy, history,\ntheology, and science, had undertaken to confer eternal bliss and to\ndamn forever. Her members, and even her priests, had gone from murder\nto mass and from mass to murder, and she had engaged in cruel wars and\npersecutions to curtail the liberties of mankind. Under that conception\nreligion was a form of insurance of the soul. Perhaps a common,\nuniversal belief had been necessary in the dark ages before the\nsublime idea of education for the masses had come; but the Church\nherself--through ignorance--had opposed the growth of education, had set\nher face sternly against the development of the individual, which Christ\nhad taught, the privilege of man to use the faculties of the intellect\nwhich God had bestowed upon him. He himself, their rector, had\nadvocated a catholic acceptance, though much modified from the mediaeval\nacceptance,--one that professed to go behind it to an earlier age. Yes,\nhe must admit with shame that he had been afraid to trust where God\ntrusted, had feared to confide the working out of the ultimate Truth of\nthe minds of the millions.\n\nThe Church had been monarchical in form, and some strove stubbornly\nand blindly to keep her monarchical. Democracy in government was\noutstripping her. Let them look around, to-day, and see what was\nhappening in the United States of America. A great movement was going\non to transfer actual participation in government from the few to the\nmany,--a movement towards true Democracy, and that was precisely what\nwas about to happen in the Church. Her condition at present was one of\nuncertainty, transition--she feared to let go wholly of the old, she\nfeared to embark upon the new. Just as the conservatives and politicians\nfeared to give up the representative system, the convention, so was she\nafraid to abandon the synod, the council, and trust to man.\n\nThe light was coming slowly, the change, the rebirth of the Church\nby gradual evolution. By the grace of God those who had laid the\nfoundations of the Church in which he stood, of all Protestantism, had\nbuilt for the future. The racial instinct in them had asserted itself,\nhad warned them that to suppress freedom in religion were to suppress it\nin life, to paralyze that individual initiative which was the secret of\ntheir advancement.\n\nThe new Church Universal, then, would be the militant, aggressive body\nof the reborn, whose mission it was to send out into the life of the\nnation transformed men and women who would labour unremittingly for\nthe Kingdom of God. Unity would come--but unity in freedom, true\nCatholicity. The truth would gradually pervade the masses--be wrought\nout by them. Even the great evolutionary forces of the age, such as\neconomic necessity, were acting to drive divided Christianity into\nconsolidation, and the starving churches of country villages were now\nbeginning to combine.\n\nNo man might venture to predict the details of the future organization\nof the united Church, although St. Paul himself had sketched it in broad\noutline: every worker, lay and clerical, labouring according to his\ngift, teachers, executives, ministers, visitors, missionaries, healers\nof sick and despondent souls. But the supreme function of the Church was\nto inspire--to inspire individuals to willing service for the cause, the\nCause of Democracy, the fellowship of mankind. If she failed to inspire,\nthe Church would wither and perish. And therefore she must revive again\nthe race of inspirers, prophets, modern Apostles to whom this gift\nwas given, going on their rounds, awaking cities and arousing whole\ncountry-sides.\n\nBut whence--it might be demanded by the cynical were the prophets to\ncome? Prophets could not be produced by training and education; prophets\nmust be born. Reborn,--that was the word. Let the Church have faith.\nOnce her Cause were perceived, once her whole energy were directed\ntowards its fulfilment, the prophets would arise, out of the East\nand out of the West, to stir mankind to higher effort, to denounce\nfearlessly the shortcomings and evils of the age. They had not failed\nin past ages, when the world had fallen into hopelessness, indifference,\nand darkness. And they would not fail now.\n\nProphets were personalities, and Phillips Brooks himself a prophet--had\ndefined personality as a conscious relationship with God. \"All truth,\"\nhe had said, \"comes to the world through personality.\" And down the\nages had come an Apostolic Succession of personalities. Paul, Augustine,\nFrancis, Dante, Luther, Milton,--yes, and Abraham Lincoln, and Phillips\nBrooks, whose Authority was that of the Spirit, whose light had so shone\nbefore men that they had glorified the Father which was in heaven; the\ncurrent of whose Power had so radiated, in ever widening circles, as to\nmake incandescent countless other souls.\n\nAnd which among them would declare that Abraham Lincoln, like Stephen,\nhad not seen his Master in the sky?\n\nThe true prophet, the true apostle, then, was one inspired and directed\nby the Spirit, the laying on of hands was but a symbol,--the symbol of\nthe sublime truth that one personality caught fire from another. Let the\nChurch hold fast to that symbol, as an acknowledgment, a reminder of\na supreme mystery. Tradition had its value when it did not deteriorate\ninto superstition, into the mechanical, automatic transmission\ncharacteristic of the mediaeval Church, for the very suggestion of which\nPeter had rebuked Simon in Samaria. For it would be remembered that\nSimon had said: \"Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay\nhands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.\"\n\nThe true successor to the Apostles must be an Apostle himself.\n\nJesus had seldom spoken literally, and the truths he sought to\nimpress upon the world had of necessity been clothed in figures and\nsymbols,--for spiritual truths might be conveyed in no other way. The\nsupreme proof of his Godship, of his complete knowledge of the meaning\nof life was to be found in his parables. To the literal, material mind,\nfor example, the parable of the talents was merely an unintelligible\ncase of injustice.... What was meant by the talents? They were\nopportunities for service. Experience taught us that when we embraced\none opportunity, one responsibility, the acceptance of it invariably led\nto another, and so the servant who had five talents, five opportunities,\ngained ten. The servant who had two gained two more. But the servant of\nwhom only one little service was asked refused that, and was cast into\nouter darkness, to witness another performing the task which should\nhave been his. Hell, here and hereafter, was the spectacle of wasted\nopportunity, and there is no suffering to compare to it.\n\nThe crime, the cardinal sin was with those who refused to serve, who\nshut their eyes to the ideal their Lord had held up, who strove to\ncompromise with Jesus Christ himself, to twist and torture his message\nto suit their own notions as to how life should be led; to please God\nand Mammon at the same time, to bind Christ's Church for their comfort\nand selfish convenience. Of them it was written, that they shut up\nthe Kingdom of Heaven against men; for they neither go in themselves,\nneither suffer them that are entering to go in. Were these any better\nthan the people who had crucified the Lord for his idealism, and because\nhe had not brought them the material Kingdom for which they longed?\n\nThat servant who had feared to act, who had hid his talent in the\nground, who had said unto his lord, \"I knew thee that thou art an hard\nman, reaping where thou hadst not sown,\" was the man without faith, the\natheist who sees only cruelty and indifference in the order of things,\nwho has no spiritual sight. But to the other servants it was said, \"Thou\nhalt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many\nthings. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\"\n\nThe meaning of life, then, was service, and by life our Lord did not\nmean mere human existence, which is only a part of life. The Kingdom of\nheaven is a state, and may begin here. And that which we saw around us\nwas only one expression of that eternal life--a medium to work through,\ntowards God. All was service, both here and hereafter, and he that had\nnot discovered that the joy of service was the only happiness worth\nliving for could have no conception of the Kingdom. To those who knew,\nthere was no happiness like being able to say, \"I have found my place in\nGod's plan, I am of use.\" Such was salvation....\n\nAnd in the parable of the Prodigal Son may be read the history of what\nare known as the Protestant nations. What happens logically when the\nindividual is suddenly freed from the restraint of external authority\noccurred when Martin Luther released the vital spark of Christianity,\nwhich he got from Paul, and from Christ himself--the revelation of\nindividual responsibility, that God the Spirit would dwell, by grace, in\nthe individual soul. Ah, we had paid a terrible yet necessary price for\nfreedom. We had wandered far from the Father, we had been reduced to\nthe very husks of individualism, become as swine. We beheld around us,\nto-day, selfishness, ruthless competition, as great contrasts between\nmisery and luxury as in the days of the Roman Empire. But should we, for\nthat reason, return to the leading-strings of authority? Could we if we\nwould? A little thought ought to convince us that the liberation of the\nindividual could not be revoked, that it had forever destroyed the power\nof authority to carry conviction. To go back to the Middle Ages would be\nto deteriorate and degenerate. No, we must go on....\n\nLuther's movement, in religion, had been the logical forerunner of\ndemocracy, of universal suffrage in government, the death-knell of\nthat misinterpretation of Christianity as the bulwark of monarchy and\nhierarchy had been sounded when he said, \"Ich kann nicht anders!\" The\nnew Republic founded on the western continent had announced to the world\nthe initiation of the transfer of Authority to the individual soul.\nGod, the counterpart of the King, the ruler in a high heaven of a flat\nterrestrial expanse, outside of the world, was now become the Spirit\nof a million spheres, the indwelling spirit in man. Democracy and the\nreligion of Jesus Christ both consisted in trusting the man--yes, and\nthe woman--whom God trusts. Christianity was individualism carried\nbeyond philosophy into religion, and the Christian, the ideal citizen\nof the democracy, was free since he served not because he had to, but\nbecause he desired to of his own will, which, paradoxically, is God's\nwill. God was in politics, to the confusion of politicians; God in\ngovernment. And in some greater and higher sense than we had yet\nperceived, the saying 'vox populi vox dei' was eternally true. He\nentered into the hearts of people and moved them, and so the world\nprogressed. It was the function of the Church to make Christians,\nuntil--when the Kingdom of God should come--the blending should be\ncomplete. Then Church and State would be identical, since all the\nmembers of the one would be the citizens of the other....\n\n\"I will arise and go to my father.\" Rebirth! A sense of responsibility,\nof consecration. So we had come painfully through our materialistic\nindividualism, through our selfish Protestantism, to a glimpse of the\ntrue Protestantism--Democracy.\n\nOur spiritual vision was glowing clearer. We were beginning to perceive\nthat charity did not consist in dispensing largesse after making a\nfortune at the expense of one's fellow-men; that there was something\nstill wrong in a government that permits it. It was gradually becoming\nplain to us, after two thousand years, that human bodies and souls\nrotting in tenements were more valuable than all the forests on all the\nhills; that government, Christian government, had something to do with\nthese.\n\nWe should embody, in government, those sublime words of the Master,\n\"Suffer little children to come unto me.\" And the government of the\nfuture would care for the little children. We were beginning to do it.\nHere, as elsewhere, Christianity and reason went hand in hand, for\nthe child became the man who either preyed on humanity and filled the\nprisons and robbed his fellows, or else grew into a useful, healthy\ncitizen. It was nothing less than sheer folly as well as inhuman cruelty\nto let the children sleep in crowded, hot rooms, reeking with diseases,\nand run wild throughout the long summer, learning vice in the city\nstreets. And we still had slavery--economic slavery--yes, and the more\nhorrible slavery of women and young girls in vice--as much a concern of\ngovernment as the problem which had confronted it in 1861.... We\nwere learning that there was something infinitely more sacred than\nproperty....\n\nAnd now Alison recalled, only to be thrilled again by an electric\nsensation she had never before experienced with such intensity, the look\nof inspiration on the preacher's face as he closed. The very mists of\nthe future seemed to break before his importuning gaze, and his eyes\nseemed indeed to behold, against the whitening dawn of the spiritual\nage he predicted, the slender spires of a new Church sprung from the\nfoundations of the old. A Church, truly catholic, tolerant, whose\nportals were wide in welcome to all mankind. The creative impulse,\nhe had declared, was invariably religious, the highest art but the\nexpression of the mute yearnings of a people, of a race. Thus had once\narisen, all over Europe, those wonderful cathedrals which still\ncast their spell upon the world, and art to-day would respond--was\nresponding--to the unutterable cravings of mankind, would strive once\nmore to express in stone and glass and pigment what nations felt.\nGeneration after generation would labour with unflagging zeal until\nthe art sculptured fragment of the new Cathedral--the new Cathedral of\nDemocracy--pointed upward toward the blue vault of heaven. Such was\nhis vision--God the Spirit, through man reborn, carrying out his great\nDesign...\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. \"WHICH SAY TO THE SEERS, SEE NOT\"\n\n\nI\n\nAs Alison arose from her knees and made her way out of the pew, it was\nthe expression on Charlotte Plimpton's face which brought her back once\nmore to a sense of her surroundings; struck her, indeed, like a physical\nblow. The expression was a scandalized one. Mrs. Plimpton had moved\ntowards her, as if to speak, but Alison hurried past, her exaltation\nsuddenly shattered, replaced by a rising tide of resentment, of angry\namazement against a materialism so solid as to remain unshaken by the\nwords which had so uplifted her. Eddies were forming in the aisle as\nthe people streamed slowly out of the church, and snatches of their\nconversation, in undertones, reached her ears.\n\n\"I should never have believed it!\"\n\n\"Mr. Hodder, of all men...\"\n\n\"The bishop!\"\n\nOutside the swinging doors, in the vestibule, the voices were raised a\nlittle, and she found her path blocked.\n\n\"It's incredible!\" she heard Gordon Atterbury saying to little Everett\nConstable, who was listening gloomily.\n\n\"Sheer Unitarianism, socialism, heresy.\"\n\nHis attention was forcibly arrested by Alison, in whose cheeks bright\nspots of colour burned. He stepped aside, involuntarily, apologetically,\nas though he had instinctively read in her attitude an unaccountable\ndisdain. Everett Constable bowed uncertainly, for Alison scarcely\nnoticed them.\n\n\"Ahem!\" said Gordon, nervously, abandoning his former companion and\njoining her, \"I was just saying, it's incredible--\"\n\nShe turned on him.\n\n\"It is incredible,\" she cried, \"that persons who call themselves\nChristians cannot recognize their religion when they hear it preached.\"\n\nHe gave back before her, visibly, in an astonishment which would have\nbeen ludicrous but for her anger. He had never understood her--such\nhad been for him her greatest fascination;--and now she was less\ncomprehensible than ever. The time had been when he would cheerfully\nhave given over his hope of salvation to have been able to stir her.\nHe had never seen her stirred, and the sight of her even now in this\ncondition was uncomfortably agitating. Of all things, an heretical\nsermon would appear to have accomplished this miracle!\n\n\"Christianity!\" he stammered.\n\n\"Yes, Christianity.\" Her voice tingled. \"I don't pretend to know much\nabout it, but Mr. Hodder has at least made it plain that it is something\nmore than dead dogmas, ceremonies, and superstitions.\"\n\nHe would have said something, but her one thought was to escape, to be\nalone. These friends of her childhood were at that moment so distasteful\nas to have become hateful. Some one laid a hand upon her arm.\n\n\"Can't we take you home, Alison? I don't see your motor.\"\n\nIt was Mrs. Constable.\n\n\"No, thanks--I'm going to walk,\" Alison answered, yet something in Mrs.\nConstable's face, in Mrs. Constable's voice, made her pause. Something\nnew, something oddly sympathetic. Their eyes met, and Alison saw that\nthe other woman's were tired, almost haggard--yet understanding.\n\n\"Mr. Hodder was right--a thousand times right, my dear,\" she said.\n\nAlison could only stare at her, and the crimson in the bright spots of\nher cheeks spread over her face. Why had Mrs. Constable supposed that\nshe would care to hear the sermon praised? But a second glance put her\nin possession of the extraordinary fact that Mrs. Constable herself was\nprofoundly moved.\n\n\"I knew he would change,\" she went on, \"I have seen for some time that\nhe was too big a man not to change. But I had no conception that he\nwould have such power, and such courage, as he has shown this morning.\nIt is not only that he dared to tell us what we were--smaller men might\nhave done that, and it is comparatively easy to denounce. But he has\nthe vision to construct, he is a seer himself--he has really made me see\nwhat Christianity is. And as long as I live I shall never forget those\nclosing sentences.\"\n\n\"And now?\" asked Alison. \"And now what will happen?\"\n\nMrs. Constable changed colour. Her tact, on which she prided herself,\nhad deserted her in a moment of unlooked-for emotion.\n\n\"Oh, I know that my father and the others will try to put him out--but\ncan they?\" Alison asked.\n\nIt was Mrs. Constable's turn to stare. The head she suddenly and\nimpulsively put forth trembled on Alison's wrist.\n\n\"I don't know, Alison--I'm afraid they can. It is too terrible to think\nabout.... And they can't--they won't believe that many changes are\ncoming, that this is but one of many signs... Do come and see me.\"\n\nAlison left her, marvelling at the passage between them, and that, of\nall persons in the congregation of St. John's, the lightning should have\nstruck Mrs. Constable...\n\nTurning to the right on Burton Street, she soon found herself walking\nrapidly westward through deserted streets lined by factories and\nwarehouses, and silent in the Sabbath calm.... She thought of Hodder,\nshe would have liked to go to him in that hour....\n\nIn Park Street, luncheon was half over, and Nelson Langmaid was at\nthe table with her father. The lawyer glanced at her curiously as she\nentered the room, and his usual word of banter, she thought, was rather\nlame. The two went on, for some time, discussing a railroad suit in\nTexas. And Alison, as she hurried through her meal, leaving the dishes\nalmost untouched, scarcely heard them. Once, in her reverie, her\nthoughts reverted to another Sunday when Hodder had sat, an honoured\nguest, in the chair which Mr. Langmaid now occupied....\n\nIt was not until they got up from the table that her father turned to\nher.\n\n\"Did you have a good sermon?\" he asked.\n\nIt was the underlying note of challenge to which she responded.\n\n\"The only good sermon I have ever heard.\"\n\nTheir eyes met. Langmaid looked down at the tip of his cigar.\n\n\"Mr. Hodder,\" said Eldon Parr, \"is to be congratulated.\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nHodder, when the service was over, had sought the familiar recess in the\nrobing-room, the words which he himself had spoken still ringing in\nhis ears. And then he recalled the desperate prayer with which he had\nentered the pulpit, that it might be given him in that hour what to say:\nthe vivid memories of the passions and miseries in Dalton Street, the\nsudden, hot response of indignation at the complacency confronting him.\nHis voice had trembled with anger.... He remembered, as he had paused in\nhis denunciation of these who had eyes and saw not, meeting the\nupturned look of Alison Parr, and his anger had turned to pity for\ntheir blindness--which once had been his own; and he had gone on and on,\nstriving to interpret for them his new revelation of the message of the\nSaviour, to impress upon them the dreadful yet sublime meaning of life\neternal. And it was in that moment the vision of the meaning of the\nevolution of his race, of the Prodigal turning to responsibility--of\nwhich he once had had a glimpse--had risen before his eyes in its\ncompleteness--the guiding hand of God in history! The Spirit in these\ncomplacent souls, as yet unstirred....\n\nSo complete, now, was his forgetfulness of self, of his future, of the\nirrevocable consequences of the step he had taken, that it was only\ngradually he became aware that some one was standing near him, and with\na start he recognized McCrae.\n\n\"There are some waiting to speak to ye,\" his assistant said.\n\n\"Oh!\" Hodder exclaimed. He began, mechanically, to divest himself of his\nsurplice. McCrae stood by.\n\n\"I'd like to say a word, first--if ye don't mind--\" he began.\n\nThe rector looked at him quickly.\n\n\"I'd like just to thank ye for that sermon--I can say no more now,\" said\nMcCrae; he turned away, and left the room abruptly.\n\nThis characteristic tribute from the inarticulate, loyal Scotchman left\nhim tingling.... He made his way to the door and saw the people in the\nchoir room, standing silently, in groups, looking toward him. Some one\nspoke to him, and he recognized Eleanor Goodrich.\n\n\"We couldn't help coming, Mr. Hodder--just to tell you how much we\nadmire you. It was wonderful, what you said.\"\n\nHe grew hot with gratitude, with thankfulness that there were some who\nunderstood--and that this woman was among them, and her husband... Phil\nGoodrich took him by the hand.\n\n\"I can understand that kind of religion,\" he said. \"And, if necessary, I\ncan fight for it. I have come to enlist.\"\n\n\"And I can understand it, too,\" added the sunburned Evelyn. \"I hope you\nwill let me help.\"\n\nThat was all they said, but Hodder understood. Eleanor Goodrich's eyes\nwere dimmed as she smiled an her sister and her husband--a smile that\nbespoke the purest quality of pride. And it was then, as they made way\nfor others, that the full value of their allegiance was borne in upon\nhim, and he grasped the fact that the intangible barrier which had\nseparated him from them had at last been broken down: His look followed\nthe square shoulders and aggressive, close-cropped head of Phil\nGoodrich, the firm, athletic figure of Evelyn, who had represented to\nhim an entire class of modern young women, vigorous, athletic, with\na scorn of cant in which he secretly sympathized, hitherto frankly\nuntouched by spiritual interests of any sort. She had, indeed, once\nbluntly told him that church meant nothing to her....\n\nIn that little company gathered in the choir room were certain members\nof his congregation whom, had he taken thought, he would least have\nexpected to see. There were Mr. and Mrs. Bradley, an elderly couple\nwho had attended St. John's for thirty years; and others of the same\nunpretentious element of his parish who were finding in modern life an\nincreasingly difficult and bewildering problem. There was little Miss\nTallant, an assiduous guild worker whom he had thought the most orthodox\nof persons; Miss Ramsay, who taught the children of the Italian mothers;\nMr. Carton, the organist, a professed free-thinker, with whom Hodder had\nhad many a futile argument; and Martha Preston, who told him that he had\nmade her think about religion seriously for the first time in her life.\n\nAnd there were others, types equally diverse. Young men of the choir,\nand others whom he had never seen, who informed him shyly that they\nwould come again, and bring their friends....\n\nAnd all the while, in the background, Hodder had been aware of a\nfamiliar face--Horace Bentley's. Beside him, when at length he drew\nnear, was his friend Asa Waring--a strangely contrasted type. The\nuncompromising eyes of a born leader of men flashed from beneath the\nheavy white eyebrows, the button of the Legion of Honour gleaming in\nhis well-kept coat seemed emblematic of the fire which in his youth had\ndriven him forth to fight for the honour of his country--a fire still\nundimmed. It was he who spoke first.\n\n\"This is a day I never expected to see, Mr. Hodder,\" he said, \"for it\nhas brought back to this church the man to whom it owes its existence.\nMr. Bentley did more, by his labour and generosity, his true\nChristianity, his charity and his wisdom, for St. John's than any other\nindividual. It is you who have brought him back, and I wish personally\nto express my gratitude.\"\n\nMr. Bentley, in mild reproof, laid his hand upon the t, shoulder of his\nold friend.\n\n\"Ah, Asa,\" he protested, \"you shouldn't say such things.\"\n\n\"Had it not been for Mr. Bentley,\" Hodder explained, \"I should not be\nhere to-day.\"\n\nAsa Waring pierced the rector with his eye, appreciating the genuine\nfeeling with which these words were spoken. And yet his look contained a\nquestion.\n\n\"Mr. Bentley,\" Hodder added, \"has been my teacher this summer.\"\n\nThe old gentleman's hand trembled a little on the goldheaded stick.\n\n\"It is a matter of more pride to me than I can express, sir, that you\nare the rector of this church with which my most cherished memories are\nassociated,\" he said. \"But I cannot take any part of the credit you give\nme for the splendid vision which you have raised up before us to-day,\nfor your inspired interpretation of history, of the meaning of our own\ntimes. You have moved me, you have given me more hope and courage than\nI have had for many a long year--and I thank you, Mr. Hodder. I am\nsure that God will prosper and guide you in what you have so nobly\nundertaken.\"\n\nMr. Bentley turned away, walking towards the end of the room.... Asa\nWaring broke the silence.\n\n\"I didn't know that you knew him, that you had seen what he is\ndoing--what he has done in this city. I cannot trust myself, Mr. Hodder,\nto speak of Horace Bentley's life... I feel too strongly on the subject.\nI have watched, year by year, this detestable spirit of greed, this lust\nfor money and power creeping over our country, corrupting our people and\ninstitutions, and finally tainting the Church itself. You have raised\nyour voice against it, and I respect and honour and thank you for it,\nthe more because you have done it without resorting to sensation, and\napparently with no thought of yourself. And, incidentally, you have\nexplained the Christian religion to me as I have never had it explained\nin my life.\n\n\"I need not tell you you have made enemies--powerful ones. I can see\nthat you are a man, and that you are prepared for them. They will leave\nno stone unturned, will neglect no means to put you out and disgrace\nyou. They will be about your ears to-morrow--this afternoon, perhaps.\nI need not remind you that the outcome is doubtful. But I came here to\nassure you of my friendship and support in all you hope to accomplish\nin making the Church what it should be. In any event, what you have done\nto-day will be productive of everlasting good.\"\n\nIn a corner still lingered the group which Mr. Bentley had joined. And\nHodder, as he made his way towards it, recognized the faces of some of\nthose who composed it. Sally Grower was there, and the young women who\nlived in Mr. Bentley's house, and others whose acquaintance he had made\nduring the summer. Mrs. Garvin had brought little Dicky, incredibly\nchanged from the wan little figure he had first beheld in the stifling\nback room in Dalton Street; not yet robust, but freckled and tanned by\nthe country sun and wind. The child, whom he had seen constantly in\nthe interval, ran forward joyfully, and Hodder bent down to take his\nhand....\n\nThese were his friends, emblematic of the new relationship in which he\nstood to mankind. And he owed them to Horace Bentley! He wondered, as\nhe greeted them, whether they knew what their allegiance meant to him in\nthis hour. But it sufficed that they claimed him as their own.\n\nBehind them all stood Kate Marcy. And it struck him for the first time,\nas he gazed at her earnestly, how her appearance had changed. She gave\nhim a frightened, bewildered look, as though she were unable to identify\nhim now with the man she had known in the Dalton Street flat, in the\nrestaurant. She was still struggling, groping, wondering, striving to\naccustom herself to the higher light of another world.\n\n\"I wanted to come,\" she faltered. \"Sally Grower brought me...\"\n\nHodder went back with them to Dalton Street. His new ministry had begun.\nAnd on this, the first day of it, it was fitting that he should sit at\nthe table of Horace Bentley, even as on that other Sunday, two years\nagone, he had gone to the home of the first layman of the diocese, Eldon\nParr.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nThe peace of God passes understanding because sorrow and joy are mingled\ntherein, sorrow and joy and striving. And thus the joy of emancipation\nmay be accompanied by a heavy heart. The next morning, when Hodder\nentered his study, he sighed as his eye fell upon the unusual pile of\nletters on his desk, for their writers had once been his friends. The\ninevitable breach had come at last.\n\nMost of the letters, as he had anticipated, were painful reading.\nAnd the silver paper-cutter with which he opened the first had been a\nChristmas present from Mrs. Burlingame, who had penned it, a lady of\nsignal devotion to the church, who for many years had made it her\ntask to supply and arrange the flowers on the altar. He had amazed and\nwounded her--she declared--inexpressibly, and she could no longer remain\nat St. John's--for the present, at least. A significant addition. He\ndropped the letter, and sat staring out of the window... presently\narousing himself, setting himself resolutely to the task of reading the\nrest.\n\nIn the mood in which he found himself he did not atop to philosophize on\nthe rigid yet sincere attitude of the orthodox. His affection for many\nof them curiously remained, though it was with some difficulty he\nstrove to reconstruct a state of mind with which he had once agreed.\nIf Christianity were to sweep on, these few unbending but faithful ones\nmust be sacrificed: such was the law... Many, while repudiating his new\nbeliefs--or unbeliefs!--added, to their regrets of the change in him,\nprotestations of a continued friendship, a conviction of his sincerity.\nOthers like Mrs. Atterbury, were frankly outraged and bitter. The\ncontents of one lilac-bordered envelope brought to his eyes a faint\nsmile. Did he know--asked the sender of this--could he know the\nconsternation he had caused in so many persons, including herself? What\nwas she to believe? And wouldn't he lunch with her on Thursday?\n\nMrs. Ferguson's letter brought another smile--more thoughtful. Her\nincoherent phrases had sprung from the heart, and the picture rose\nbefore him of the stout but frightened, good-natured lady who had never\naccustomed herself to the enjoyment of wealth and luxury. Mr. Ferguson\nwas in such a state, and he must please not tell her husband that she\nhad written. Yet much in his sermon had struck her as so true. It seemed\nwrong to her to have so much, and others so little! And he had made her\nremember many things in her early life she had forgotten. She hoped he\nwould see Mr. Ferguson, and talk to him....\n\nThen there was Mrs. Constable's short note, that troubled and puzzled\nhim. This, too, had in it an undercurrent of fear, and the memory came\nto him of the harrowing afternoon he had once spent with her, when\nshe would have seemed to have predicted the very thing which had now\nhappened to him. And yet not that thing. He divined instinctively that\na maturer thought on the subject of his sermon had brought on an\nuneasiness as the full consequences of this new teaching had dawned upon\nher consequences which she had not foreseen when she had foretold the\nchange. And he seemed to read between the lines that the renunciation he\ndemanded was too great. Would he not let her come and talk to him?...\n\nMiss Brewer, a lady of no inconsiderable property, was among those who\ntold him plainly that if he remained they would have to give up their\npews. Three or four communications were even more threatening. Mr.\nAlpheus Gore, Mrs. Plimpton's brother, who at five and forty had managed\nto triple his share of the Gore inheritance, wrote that it would be his\nregretful duty to send to the bishop an Information on the subject of\nMr. Hodder's sermon.\n\nThere were, indeed, a few letters which he laid, thankfully, in a pile\nby themselves. These were mostly from certain humble members of his\nparish who had not followed their impulses to go to him after the\nservice, or from strangers who had chanced to drop into the church. Some\nwere autobiographical, such as those of a trained nurse, a stenographer,\na hardware clerk who had sat up late Sunday night to summarize what that\nsermon had meant to him, how a gray and hopeless existence had taken on\na new colour. Next Sunday he would bring a friend who lived in the same\nboarding house.... Hodder read every word of these, and all were in\nthe same strain: at last they could perceive a meaning to religion, an\napplication of it to such plodding lives as theirs....\n\nOne or two had not understood, but had been stirred, and were coming to\ntalk to him. Another was filled with a venomous class hatred....\n\nThe first intimation he had of the writer of another letter seemed from\nthe senses rather than the intellect. A warm glow suffused him, mounted\nto his temples as he stared at the words, turned over the sheet, and\nread at the bottom the not very legible signature. The handwriting, by\nno means classic, became then and there indelibly photographed on his\nbrain, and summed up for him the characteristics, the warring elements\nin Alison Parr. \"All afternoon,\" she wrote, \"I have been thinking of\nyour sermon. It was to me very wonderful--it lifted me out of myself.\nAnd oh, I want so much to believe unreservedly what you expressed\nso finely, that religion is democracy, or the motive power behind\ndemocracy--the service of humanity by the reborn. I understand it\nintellectually. I am willing to work for such a Cause, but there is\nsomething in me so hard that I wonder if it can dissolve. And then I\nam still unable to identify that Cause with the Church as at present\nconstituted, with the dogmas and ceremonies that still exist. I am too\nthorough a radical to have your patience. And I am filled with rage--I\ncan think of no milder word--on coming in contact with the living\nembodiments of that old creed, who hold its dogmas so precious. 'Which\nsay to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us\nright things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.'\"\n\n\"You see, I have been reading Isaiah, and when I came to that paragraph\nit seemed so appropriate. These people have always existed. And will\nthey not always continue to exist? I wish I could believe, wholly and\nunreservedly, that this class, always preponderant in the world, could\nbe changed, diminished--done away with in a brighter future! I can, at\nleast, sympathize with Isaiah's wrath.\n\n\"What you said of the longing, the yearning which exists to-day amongst\nthe inarticulate millions moved me most--and of the place of art in\nreligion, to express that yearning. Religion the motive power of art,\nand art, too, service. 'Consider the lilies of the field.' You have made\nit, at least, all-comprehensive, have given me a new point of view for\nwhich I can never be sufficiently grateful--and at a time when I needed\nit desperately. That you have dared to do what you have done has been\nand will be an inspiration, not only to myself, but to many others.\nThis, is a longer letter, I believe, than I have ever written in my\nlife. But I wanted you to know.\"\n\nHe reread it twice, pondering over its phrases. \"A new point of view....\nat a time when I needed it desperately.\" It was not until then that he\nrealized the full intensity of his desire for some expression from her\nsince the moment he had caught sight of her in the church. But he had\nnot been prepared for the unreserve, the impulsiveness with which she\nhad actually written. Such was his agitation that he did not heed, at\nfirst, a knock on the door, which was repeated. He thrust the letter\ninside his coat as the janitor of the parish house appeared.\n\n\"There is a gentleman to see you, sir, in the office,\" he said.\n\nHodder went down the stairs. And he anticipated, from the light yet\nnervous pacing that he heard on the bare floor, that the visitor was\nnone other than his vestryman, Mr. Gordon Atterbury. The sight of the\ngentleman's spruce figure confirmed the guess.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Atterbury,\" he said as he entered.\n\nMr. Atterbury stopped in his steps, as if he had heard a shot.\n\n\"Ah--good morning, Mr. Hodder. I stopped in on my way to the office.\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" said the rector.\n\nMr. Atterbury sat down, but with the air of a man who does so under\nprotest, who had not intended to. He was visibly filled and almost\nquivering with an excitement which seemed to demand active expression,\nand which the tall clergyman's physical calm and self-possession seemed\nto augment. For a moment Mr. Atterbury stared at the rector as he sat\nbehind his desk. Then he cleared his throat.\n\n\"I thought of writing to you, Mr. Hodder. My mother, I believe, has\ndone so. But it seemed to me, on second thought, better to come to you\ndirect.\"\n\nThe rector nodded, without venturing to remark on the wisdom of the\ncourse.\n\n\"It occurred to me,\" Mr. Atterbury went on, \"that possibly some things I\nwish to discuss might--ahem be dispelled in a conversation. That I might\nconceivably have misunderstood certain statements in your sermon of\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"I tried,\" said the rector, \"to be as clear as possible.\"\n\n\"I thought you might not fully have realized the effect of what you\nsaid. I ought to tell you, I think, that as soon as I reached home\nI wrote out, as accurately as I could from memory, the gist of your\nremarks. And I must say frankly, although I try to put it mildly, that\nthey appear to contradict and controvert the doctrines of the Church.\"\n\n\"Which doctrines?\" Hodder asked.\n\nGordon Atterbury sputtered.\n\n\"Which doctrines?\" he repeated. \"Can it be possible that you\nmisunderstand me? I might refer you to those which you yourself preached\nas late as last June, in a sermon which was one of the finest and most\nscholarly efforts I ever heard.\"\n\n\"It was on that day, Mr. Atterbury,\" replied the rector, with a touch\nof sadness in his voice, \"I made the discovery that fine and scholarly\nefforts were not Christianity.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Mr. Atterbury demanded.\n\n\"I mean that they do not succeed in making Christians.\"\n\n\"And by that you imply that the members of your congregation, those who\nhave been brought up and baptized and confirmed in this church, are not\nChristians?\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say a great many of them are not,\" said the rector.\n\n\"In other words, you affirm that the sacrament of baptism is of no\naccount.\"\n\n\"I affirm that baptism with water is not sufficient.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that this is very grave,\" Mr. Hodder.\n\n\"I quite agree with you,\" replied the rector, looking straight at his\nvestryman.\n\n\"And I understood,--\" the other went on, clearing his throat once more,\n\"I think I have it correctly stated in my notes, but I wish to be quite\nclear, that you denied the doctrine of the virgin birth.\"\n\nHodder made a strong effort to control himself.\n\n\"What I have said I have said,\" he answered, \"and I have said it in the\nhope that it might make some impression upon the lives of those to\nwhom I spoke. You were one of them, Mr. Atterbury. And if I repeat\nand amplify my meaning now, it must be understood that I have no other\nobject except that of putting you in the way of seeing that the religion\nof Christ is unique in that it is dependent upon no doctrine or dogma,\nupon no external or material sign or proof or authority whatever. I am\nutterly indifferent to any action you may contemplate taking concerning\nme. Read your four Gospels carefully. If we do not arrive, through\ncontemplation of our Lord's sojourn on this earth, of his triumph\nover death, of his message--which illuminates the meaning of our lives\nhere--at that inner spiritual conversion of which he continually speaks,\nand which alone will give us charity, we are not Christians.\"\n\n\"But the doctrines of the Church, which we were taught from childhood to\nbelieve? The doctrines which you once professed, and of which you have\nnow made such an unlooked-for repudiation!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have changed,\" said the rector, gazing seriously at the\ntwitching figure of his vestryman, \"I was bound, body and soul, by those\nvery doctrines.\" He roused himself. \"But on what grounds do you declare,\nMr. Atterbury,\" he demanded, somewhat sternly, \"that this church is\nfettered by an ancient and dogmatic conception of Christianity? Where\nare you to find what are called the doctrines of the Church? What may\nbe heresy in one diocese is not so in another, and I can refer to you\nvolumes written by ministers of this Church, in good standing, whose\npublished opinions are the same as those I expressed in my sermon of\nyesterday. The very cornerstone of the Church is freedom, but many have\nyet to discover this, and we have held in our Communion men of such\ndivergent views as Dr. Pusey and Phillips Brooks. Mr. Newman, in his\nTract Ninety, which was sincerely written, showed that the Thirty-nine\nArticles were capable of almost any theological interpretation. From\nwhat authoritative source are we to draw our doctrines? In the baptismal\nservice the articles of belief are stated to be in the Apostles' Creed,\nbut nowhere--in this Church is it defined how their ancient language\nis to be interpreted. That is wisely left to the individual. Shall\nwe interpret the Gospels by the Creeds, which in turn purport to be\ninterpretations of the Gospels? Or shall we draw our conclusions as to\nwhat the Creeds may mean to us by pondering on the life of Christ, and\nstriving to do his will? 'The letter killeth, but the Spirit maketh\nalive.'\"\n\nHodder rose, and stood facing his visitor squarely. He spoke slowly, and\nthe fact that he made no gesture gave all the more force to his words.\n\n\"Hereafter, Mr. Atterbury,\" he added, \"so long as I am rector of this\nchurch, I am going to do my best to carry out the spirit of Christ's\nteaching--to make Christians. And there shall be no more compromise, so\nfar as I can help it.\"\n\nGordon Atterbury had grown very pale. He, too, got to his feet.\n\n\"I--I cannot trust myself to discuss this matter with you any further,\nMr. Hodder. I feel too deeply--too strongly on the subject. I do not\npretend to account for this astonishing transformation in your opinions.\nUp to the present I have deemed St. John's fortunate--peculiarly\nfortunate, in having you for its rector. I am bound to say I think you\nhave not considered, in this change of attitude on your part, those\nwho have made St. John's what it is, who through long and familiar\nassociation are bound to it by a thousand ties,--those who, like myself,\nhave what may be called a family interest in this church. My father and\nmother were married here, I was baptized here. I think I may go so\nfar as to add, Mr. Hodder, that this is our church, the church which a\ncertain group of people have built in which to worship God, as was their\nright. Nor do I believe we can be reproached with a lack of hospitality\nor charity. We maintain this parish house, with its clubs; and at no\nsmall inconvenience to ourselves we have permitted the church to remain\nin this district. There is no better church music in this city, and we\nhave a beautiful service in the evening at which, all pews are free. It\nis not unreasonable that we should have something to say concerning the\ndoctrine to be preached here, that we should insist that that doctrine\nbe in accordance with what we have always believed was the true doctrine\nas received by this Church.\"\n\nUp to this point Mr. Atterbury had had a feeling that he had not carried\nout with much distinction the programme which he had so carefully\nrehearsed on the way to the parish house. Hodder's poise had amazed and\nbaffled him--he had expected to find the rector on the defensive. But\nnow, burning anew with a sense of injustice, he had a sense at last of\nputting his case strongly.\n\nThe feeling of triumph, however, was short lived. Hodder did not reply\nat once. So many seconds, indeed, went by that Mr. Atterbury began once\nmore to grow slightly nervous under the strange gaze to which he was\nsubjected. And when the clergyman' spoke there was no anger in his\nvoice, but a quality--a feeling which was disturbing, and difficult to\ndefine.\n\n\"You are dealing now, Mr. Atterbury,\" he said, \"with the things of\nCaesar, not of God. This church belongs to God--not to you. But you\nhave consecrated it to him. His truth, as Christ taught it, must not be\npreached to suit any man's convenience. When you were young you were not\ntaught the truth--neither was I. It was mixed with adulterations which\nobscured and almost neutralized it. But I intend to face it now, and\nto preach it, and not the comfortable compromise which gives us the\nillusion that we are Christians because we subscribe to certain tenets,\nand permits us to neglect our Christian duties.\n\n\"And since you have spoken of charity, let me assure you that there is\nno such thing as charity without the transforming, personal touch. It\nisn't the bread or instruction or amusement we give people vicariously,\nbut the effect of our gift--even if that gift be only a cup of cold\nwater--in illuminating and changing their lives. And it will avail\nany church little to have a dozen settlement houses while her members\nacquiesce in a State which refuses to relieve her citizens from sickness\nand poverty. Charity bends down only to lift others up. And with all our\nworks, our expenditure and toil, how many have we lifted up?\"\n\nGordon Atterbury's indignation got the better of him. For he was the\nlast man to behold with patience the shattering of his idols.\n\n\"I think you have cast an unwarranted reflection on those who have built\nand made this church what it is, Mr. Hodder,\" he exclaimed. \"And that\nyou will find there are in it many--a great many earnest Christians\nwho were greatly shocked by the words you spoke yesterday, who will not\ntolerate any interference with their faith. I feel it my duty to speak\nfrankly, Mr Hodder, disagreeable though it be, in view of our former\nrelations. I must tell you that I am not alone in the opinion that you\nshould resign. It is the least you can do, in justice to us, in justice\nto yourself. There are other bodies--I cannot call them churches--which\ndoubtless would welcome your liberal, and I must add atrophying,\ninterpretation of Christianity. And I trust that reflection will\nconvince you of the folly of pushing this matter to the extreme. We\nshould greatly deplore the sensational spectacle of St. John's being\ninvolved in an ecclesiastical trial, the unpleasant notoriety into which\nit would bring a church hitherto untouched by that sort of thing. And I\nought to tell you that I, among others, am about to send an Information\nto the bishop.\"\n\nGordon Atterbury hesitated a moment, but getting no reply save an\ninclination of the head, took up his hat.\n\n\"Ahem--I think that is all I have to say, Mr. Hodder. Good morning.\"\n\nEven then Hodder did not answer, but rose and held open the door. As\nhe made his exit under the strange scrutiny of the clergyman's gaze the\nlittle vestryman was plainly uncomfortable. He cleared his throat once\nmore, halted, and then precipitately departed.\n\nHodder went to the window and thoughtfully watched the hurrying figure\nof Mr. Atterbury until it disappeared, almost skipping, around the\ncorner .... The germ of truth, throughout the centuries, had lost\nnothing of its dynamic potentialities. If released and proclaimed it\nwas still powerful enough to drive the world to insensate anger and\nopposition....\n\nAs he stood there, lost in reflection, a shining automobile drew up at\nthe curb, and from it descended a firm lady in a tight-fitting suit whom\nhe recognized as Mrs Wallis Plimpton. A moment later she had invaded\nthe office--for no less a word may be employed to express her physical\naggressiveness, the glowing health which she radiated.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Hodder,\" she said, seating herself in one of the\nstraight-backed chairs. \"I have been so troubled since you preached that\nsermon yesterday, I could scarcely sleep. And I made up my mind I'd\ncome to you the first thing this morning. Mr. Plimpton and I have been\ndiscussing it. In fact, people are talking of nothing else. We dined\nwith the Laureston Greys last night, and they, too, were full of it.\"\nCharlotte Plimpton looked at him, and the flow of her words suddenly\ndiminished. And she added, a little lamely for her, \"Spiritual matters\nin these days are so difficult, aren't they?\"\n\n\"Spiritual matters always were difficult, Mrs. Plimpton,\" he said.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" she assented hurriedly, with what was intended for a\nsmile. \"But what I came to ask you is this--what are we to teach our\nchildren?\"\n\n\"Teach them the truth,\" the rector replied.\n\n\"One of the things which troubled me most was your reference to modern\ncriticism,\" she went on, recovering her facility. \"I was brought up to\nbelieve that the Bible was true. The governess--Miss Standish, you know,\nsuch a fine type of Englishwoman--reads the children Bible stories\nevery Sunday evening. They adore them, and little Wallis can repeat them\nalmost by heart--the pillar of cloud by day, Daniel in the lions' den,\nand the Wise Men from the East. If they aren't true, some one ought to\nhave told us before now.\"\n\nA note of injury had crept into her voice.\n\n\"How do you feel about these things yourself?\" Holder inquired.\n\n\"How do I feel? Why, I have never thought about them very much--they\nwere there, in the Bible!\"\n\n\"You were taught to believe them?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she exclaimed, resenting what seemed a reflection on the\nGore orthodoxy.\n\n\"Do they in any manner affect your conduct?\"\n\n\"My conduct?\" she repeated. \"I don't know what you mean. I was brought\nup in the church, and Mr. Plimpton has always gone, and we are bringing\nup the children to go. Is that what you mean?\"\n\n\"No,\" Hodder answered, patiently, \"that is not what I mean. I ask\nwhether these stories in any way enter into your life, become part of\nyou, and tend to make you a more useful woman?\"\n\n\"Well--I have never considered them in that way,\" she replied, a little\nperplexed.\n\n\"Do you believe in them yourself?\"\n\n\"Why--I don't know,--I've never thought. I don't suppose I do,\nabsolutely--not in those I have mentioned.\"\n\n\"And you think it right to teach things to your children which you do\nnot yourself believe?\"\n\n\"How am I to decide?\" she demanded.\n\n\"First by finding out yourself what you do believe,\" he replied, with a\ntouch of severity.\n\n\"Mr. Hodder!\" she cried in a scandalized voice, \"do you mean to say\nthat I, who have been brought up in this church, do not know what\nChristianity is.\"\n\nHe looked at her and shook his head.\n\n\"You must begin by being honest with yourself,\" he went on, not heeding\nher shocked expression. \"If you are really in earnest in this matter,\nI should be glad to help you all I can. But I warn you there is no\nachievement in the world more difficult than that of becoming a\nChristian. It means a conversion of your whole being something which you\ncannot now even imagine. It means a consuming desire which,--I fear,--in\nconsideration of your present mode of life, will be difficult to\nacquire.\"\n\n\"My present mode of life!\" she gasped.\n\n\"Precisely,\" said the rector. He was silent, regarding, her. There was\ndiscernible not the slightest crack of crevice in the enamel of this\nwoman's worldly armour.\n\nFor the moment her outraged feelings were forgotten. The man had\nfascinated her. To be told, in this authoritative manner, that she was\nwicked was a new and delightful experience. It brought back to her the\nreal motive of her visit, which had in reality been inspired not only by\nthe sermon of the day before, but by sheer curiosity.\n\n\"What would you have me do?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Find yourself.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that I am not--myself?\" she asked, now completely\nbewildered.\n\n\"I mean to say that you are nobody until you achieve conviction.\"\n\nFor Charlotte Plimpton, nee Gore, to be told in her own city, by the\nrector of her own church that she was nobody was an event hitherto\ninconceivable! It was perhaps as extraordinary that she did not resent.\nit. Curiosity still led her on.\n\n\"Conviction?\" she repeated. \"But I have conviction, Mr. Hodder. I\nbelieve in the doctrines of the Church.\"\n\n\"Belief!\" he exclaimed, and checked himself strongly. \"Conviction\nthrough feeling. Not until then will you find what you were put in the\nworld for.\"\n\n\"But my husband--my children? I try to do my duty.\"\n\n\"You must get a larger conception of it,\" Hodder replied.\n\n\"I suppose you mean,\" she declared, \"that I am to spend the rest of my\nlife in charity.\"\n\n\"How you would spend the rest of your life would be revealed to you,\"\nsaid the rector.\n\nIt was the weariness in his tone that piqued her now, the intimation\nthat he did not believe in her sincerity--had not believed in it from\nthe first. The life-long vanity of a woman used to be treated with\nconsideration, to be taken seriously, was aroused. This extraordinary\nman had refused to enter into the details which she inquisitively\ncraved.\n\nCharlotte Plimpton rose.\n\n\"I shall not bother you any longer at present, Mr. Hodder,\" she said\nsweetly. \"I know you must have, this morning especially, a great deal to\ntrouble you.\"\n\nHe met her scrutiny calmly.\n\n\"It is only the things we permit to trouble us that do so, Mrs.\nPlimpton,\" he replied. \"My own troubles have arisen largely from a lack\nof faith on the part of those whom I feel it is my duty to influence.\"\n\nIt was then she delivered her parting shot, which she repeated, with\nmuch satisfaction, to her husband that evening. She had reached the\ndoor. \"Was there a special service at Calvary yesterday?\" she asked\ninnocently, turning back.\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"I wondered. Mr. Parr was there; I'm told--and he's never been known to\ndesert St. John's except on the rarest occasions. But oh, Mr. Hodder, I\nmust congratulate you on your influence with Alison. When she has been\nout here before she never used to come to church at all.\"\n\n\n\n\nVolume 7.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. THE CHOICE\n\n\nI\n\nPondering over Alison's note, he suddenly recalled and verified some\nphrases which had struck him that summer on reading Harnack's celebrated\nHistory of Dogma, and around these he framed his reply. \"To act as if\nfaith in eternal life and in the living Christ was the simplest thing in\nthe world, or a dogma to which one has to submit, is irreligious... It\nis Christian to pray that God would give the Spirit to make us strong\nto overcome the feelings and the doubts of nature... Where this faith,\nobtained in this way, exists, it has always been supported by the\nconviction that the Man lives who brought life and immortality to\nlight. To hold fast this faith is the goal of life, for only what we\nconsciously strive for is in this matter our own. What we think we\npossess is very soon lost.\"\n\n\"The feelings and the doubts of nature!\" The Divine Discontent, the\nstriving against the doubt that every honest soul experiences and\nadmits. Thus the contrast between her and these others who accepted and\nwent their several ways was brought home to him.\n\nHe longed to talk to her, but his days were full. Yet the very thought\nof her helped to bear him up as his trials, his problems accumulated;\nnor would he at any time have exchanged them for the former false peace\nwhich had been bought (he perceived more and more clearly) at the price\nof compromise.\n\nThe worst of these trials, perhaps, was a conspicuous article in\na newspaper containing a garbled account of his sermon and of the\nsensation it had produced amongst his fashionable parishioners. He\nhad refused to see the reporter, but he had been made out a hero, a\nsocialistic champion of the poor. The black headlines were nauseating;\nand beside them, in juxtaposition, were pen portraits of himself and of\nEldon Parr. There were rumours that the banker had left the church until\nthe recalcitrant rector should be driven out of it; the usual long list\nof Mr. Parr's benefactions was included, and certain veiled paragraphs\nconcerning his financial operations. Mr. Ferguson, Mr. Plimpton, Mr.\nConstable, did not escape,--although they, too, had refused to be\ninterviewed....\n\nThe article brought to the parish house a bevy of reporters who had\nto be fought off, and another batch of letters, many of them from\nministers, in approval or condemnation.\n\nHis fellow-clergymen called, some to express sympathy and encouragement,\nmore of them to voice in person indignant and horrified protests. Dr.\nAnnesley of Calvary--a counterpart of whose rubicund face might\nhave been found in the Council of Trent or in mediaeval\nfish-markets--pronounced his anathemas with his hands folded comfortably\nover his stomach, but eventually threw to the winds every vestige of his\necclesiastical dignity....\n\nThen there came a note from the old bishop, who was traveling. A kindly\nnote, withal, if non-committal,--to the effect that he had received\ncertain communications, but that his physician would not permit him\nto return for another ten days or so. He would then be glad to see Mr.\nHolder and talk with him.\n\nWhat would the bishop do? Holder's relations with him had been more than\nfriendly, but whether the bishop's views were sufficiently liberal to\nsupport him in the extreme stand he had taken he could not surmise. For\nit meant that the bishop, too, must enter into a conflict with the first\nlayman of his diocese, of whose hospitality he had so often partaken,\nwhose contributions had been on so lordly a scale. The bishop was in\nhis seventieth year, and had hitherto successfully fought any attempt to\nsupply him with an assistant,--coadjutor or suffragan.\n\nAt such times the fear grew upon Hodder that he might be recommended for\ntrial, forced to abandon his fight to free the Church from the fetters\nthat bound her: that the implacable hostility of his enemies would rob\nhim of his opportunity.\n\nThus ties were broken, many hard things were said and brought to his\nears. There were vacancies in the classes and guilds, absences that\npained him, silences that wrung him....\n\nOf all the conversations he held, that with Mrs. Constable was perhaps\nthe most illuminating and distressing. As on that other occasion, when\nhe had gone to her, this visit was under the seal of confession, unknown\nto her husband. And Hodder had been taken aback, on seeing her enter his\noffice, by the very tragedy in her face--the tragedy he had momentarily\nbeheld once before. He drew up a chair for her, and when she had sat\ndown she gazed at him some moments without speaking.\n\n\"I had to come,\" she said; \"there are some things I feel I must ask you.\nFor I have been very miserable since I heard you on Sunday.\"\n\nHe nodded gently.\n\n\"I knew that you would change your views--become broader, greater. You\nmay remember that I predicted it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought you would grow more liberal, less bigoted, if you will allow\nme to say so. But I didn't anticipate--\" she hesitated, and looked up at\nhim again.\n\n\"That I would take the extreme position I have taken,\" he assisted her.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Hodder,\" she cried impulsively, \"was it necessary to go so far?\nand all at once. I am here not only because I am miserable, but I am\nconcerned on your account. You hurt me very much that day you came to\nme, but you made me your friend. And I wonder if you really understand\nthe terrible, bitter feeling you have aroused, the powerful enemies you\nhave made by speaking so--so unreservedly?\"\n\n\"I was prepared for it,\" he answered. \"Surely, Mrs. Constable, once I\nhave arrived at what I believe to be the truth, you would not have me\ntemporize?\"\n\nShe gave him a wan smile.\n\n\"In one respect, at least, you have not changed,\" she told him. \"I am\nafraid you are not the temporizing kind. But wasn't there,--mayn't there\nstill be a way to deal with this fearful situation? You have made it\nvery hard for us--for them. You have given them no loophole of escape.\nAnd there are many, like me, who do not wish to see your career ruined,\nMr. Hodder.\"\n\n\"Would you prefer,\" he asked, \"to see my soul destroyed? And your own?\"\n\nHer lips twitched.\n\n\"Isn't there any other way but that? Can't this transformation, which\nyou say is necessary and vital, come gradually? You carried me away as\nI listened to you, I was not myself when I came out of the church. But\nI have been thinking ever since. Consider my husband, Mr. Hodder,\" her\nvoice faltered. \"I shall not mince matters with you--I know you will not\npretend to misunderstand me. I have never seen him so upset since\nsince that time Gertrude was married. He is in a most cruel position.\nI confessed to you once that Mr. Parr had made for us all the money we\npossess. Everett is fond of you, but if he espouses your cause, on the\nvestry, we shall be ruined.\"\n\nHodder was greatly moved.\n\n\"It is not my cause, Mrs. Constable,\" he said.\n\n\"Surely, Christianity is not so harsh and uncompromising as that! And do\nyou quite do justice to--to some of these men? There was no one to tell\nthem the wrongs they were committing--if they were indeed wrongs. Our\ncivilization is far from perfect.\"\n\n\"The Church may have been remiss, mistaken,\" the rector replied. \"But\nthe Christianity she has taught, adulterated though it were, has never\ncondoned the acts which have become commonplace in modern finance. There\nmust have been a time, in the life of every one of these men, when they\nhad to take that first step against which their consciences revolted,\nwhen they realized that fraud and taking advantage of the ignorant and\nweak were wrong. They have deliberately preferred gratification in this\nlife to spiritual development--if indeed they believe in any future\nwhatsoever. For 'whosoever will save his life shall lose it' is as true\nto-day as it ever was. They have had their choice--they still have it.\"\n\n\"I am to blame,\" she cried. \"I drove my husband to it, I made him think\nof riches, it was I who cultivated Mr. Parr. And oh, I suppose I am\njustly punished. I have never been happy for one instant since that\nday.\"\n\nHe watched her, pityingly, as she wept. But presently she raised her\nface, wonderingly.\n\n\"You do believe in the future life after--after what you have been\nthrough?\"\n\n\"I do,\" he answered simply.\n\n\"Yes--I am sure you do. It is that, what you are, convinces me you do.\nEven the remarkable and sensible explanation you gave of it when\nyou interpreted the parable of the talents is not so powerful as\nthe impression that you yourself believe after thinking it out for\nyourself--not accepting the old explanations. And then,\" she added, with\na note as of surprise, \"you are willing to sacrifice everything for it!\"\n\n\"And you?\" he asked. \"Cannot you, too, believe to that extent?\"\n\n\"Everything?\" she repeated. \"It would mean--poverty. No--God help me--I\ncannot face it. I have become too hard. I cannot do without the world.\nAnd even if I could! Oh, you cannot know what you ask Everett, my\nhusband--I must say it, you make me tell you everything--is not free.\nHe is little better than a slave to Eldon Parr. I hate Eldon Parr,\" she\nadded, with startling inconsequence.\n\n\"If I had only known what it would lead to when I made Everett what\nhe is! But I knew nothing of business, and I wanted money, position to\nsatisfy my craving at the loss of--that other thing. And now I couldn't\nchange my husband if I would. He hasn't the courage, he hasn't the\nvision. What there was of him, long ago, has been killed--and I killed\nit. He isn't--anybody, now.\"\n\nShe relapsed again into weeping.\n\n\"And then it might not mean only poverty--it might mean disgrace.\"\n\n\"Disgrace!\" the rector involuntarily took up the word.\n\n\"There are some things he has done,\" she said in a low voice, \"which he\nthought he was obliged to do which Eldon Parr made him do.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Parr, too--?\" Hodder began.\n\n\"Oh, it was to shield Eldon Parr. They could never be traced to him. And\nif they ever came out, it would kill my husband. Tell me,\" she implored,\n\"what can I do? What shall I do? You are responsible. You have made me\nmore bitterly unhappy than ever.\"\n\n\"Are you willing,\" he asked, after a moment, \"to make the supreme\nrenunciation? to face poverty, and perhaps disgrace, to save your soul\nand others?\"\n\n\"And--others?\"\n\n\"Yes. Your sacrifice would not, could not be in vain. Otherwise I should\nbe merely urging on you the individualism which you once advocated with\nme.\"\n\n\"Renunciation.\" She pronounced the word questioningly. \"Can Christianity\nreally mean that--renunciation of the world? Must we take it in the\ndrastic sense of the Church of the early centuries-the Church of the\nMartyrs?\"\n\n\"Christianity demands all of us, or nothing,\" he replied. \"But the false\ninterpretation of renunciation of the early Church has cast its blight\non Christianity even to our day. Oriental asceticism, Stoicism, Philo\nand other influences distorted Christ's meaning. Renunciation does not\nmean asceticism, retirement from the world, a denial of life. And the\nearly Christian, since he was not a citizen, since he took the view that\nthis mortal existence was essentially bad and kept his eyes steadfastly\nfixed on another, was the victim at once of false philosophies and of\nthe literal messianic prophecies of the Jews, which were taken over with\nChristianity. The earthly kingdom which was to come was to be the result\nof some kind of a cataclysm. Personally, I believe our Lord merely used\nthe Messianic literature as a convenient framework for his spiritual\nKingdom of heaven, and that the Gospels misinterpret his meaning on this\npoint.\n\n\"Renunciation is not the withdrawal from, the denial of life, but the\nfulfilment of life, the submission to the divine will and guidance in\norder that our work may be shown us. Renunciation is the assumption,\nat once, of heavenly and earthly citizenship, of responsibility for\nourselves and our fellow-men. It is the realization that the other\nworld, the inner, spiritual world, is here, now, and that the soul may\ndwell in it before death, while the body and mind work for the coming of\nwhat may be called the collective kingdom. Life looked upon in that way\nis not bad, but good,--not meaningless, but luminous.\"\n\nShe had listened hungrily, her eyes fixed upon his face.\n\n\"And for me?\" she questioned.\n\n\"For you,\" he answered, leaning forward and speaking with a conviction\nthat shook her profoundly, \"if you make the sacrifice of your present\nunhappiness, of your misery, all will be revealed. The labour which you\nhave shirked, which is now hidden from you, will be disclosed, you\nwill justify your existence by taking your place as an element of the\ncommunity. You will be able to say of yourself, at last, 'I am of use.'\"\n\n\"You mean--social work?\"\n\nThe likeness of this to Mrs. Plimpton's question struck him. She had\ncalled it \"charity.\" How far had they wandered in their teaching from\nthe Revelation of the Master, since it was as new and incomprehensible\nto these so-called Christians as to Nicodemus himself!\n\n\"All Christian work is social, Mrs. Constable, but it is founded on\nlove. 'Thou shaft love thy neighbour as thyself.' You hold your own soul\nprecious, since it is the shrine of God. And for that reason you hold\nequally precious your neighbour's soul. Love comes first, as revelation,\nas imparted knowledge, as the divine gist of autonomy--self-government.\nAnd then one cannot help working, socially, at the task for which we are\nmade by nature most efficient. And in order to discover what that task\nis, we must wait.\"\n\n\"Why did not some one tell me this, when I was young?\" she asked--not\nspeaking to him. \"It seems so simple.\"\n\n\"It is simple. The difficult thing is to put it into practice--the most\ndifficult thing in the world. Both courage and faith are required,\nfaith that is content to trust as to the nature of the reward. It is the\nwisdom of foolishness. Have you the courage?\"\n\nShe pressed her hands together.\n\n\"Alone--perhaps I should have. I don't know. But my husband! I was able\nto influence him to his destruction, and now I am powerless. Darkness\nhas closed around me. He would not--he will not listen to me.\"\n\n\"You have tried?\"\n\n\"I have attempted to talk to him, but the whole of my life contradicts\nmy words. He cannot see me except as, the woman who drove him into\nmaking money. Sometimes I think he hates me.\"\n\nHodder recalled, as his eyes rested on her compassionately, the\nsufferings of that other woman in Dalton Street.\n\n\"Would you have me desert him--after all these years?\" she whispered. \"I\noften think he would be happier, even now.\"\n\n\"I would have you do nothing save that which God himself will reveal to\nyou. Go home, go into the church and pray--pray for knowledge. I think\nyou will find that you are held responsible for your husband. Pray that\nthat which you have broken, you may mend again.\"\n\n\"Do you think there is a chance?\"\n\nHodder made a gesture.\n\n\"God alone can judge as to the extent of his punishments.\"\n\nShe got to her feet, wearily.\n\n\"I feel no hope--I feel no courage, but--I will try. I see what you\nmean--that my punishment is my powerlessness.\"\n\nHe bent his head.\n\n\"You are so strong--perhaps you can help me.\"\n\n\"I shall always be ready,\" he replied.\n\nHe escorted her down the steps to the dark blue brougham with\nupstanding, chestnut horses which was waiting at the curb. But Mrs.\nConstable turned to the footman, who held open the door.\n\n\"You may stay here awhile,\" she said to him, and gave Hodder her\nhand....\n\nShe went into the church....\n\n\n\nII\n\nAsa Waring and his son-in-law, Phil Goodrich, had been to see Hodder on\nthe subject of the approaching vestry meeting, and both had gone away\nnot a little astonished and impressed by the calmness with which the\nrector looked forward to the conflict. Others of his parishioners, some\nof whom were more discreet in their expressions of sympathy, were no\nless surprised by his attitude; and even his theological adversaries,\nsuch as Gordon Atterbury, paid him a reluctant tribute. Thanks, perhaps,\nto the newspaper comments as much as to any other factor, in the\nminds of those of all shades of opinion in the parish the issue had\ncrystallized into a duel between the rector and Eldon Parr. Bitterly\nas they resented the glare of publicity into which St. John's had\nbeen dragged, the first layman of the diocese was not beloved; and the\nfairer-minded of Hodder's opponents, though appalled, were forced to\nadmit in their hearts that the methods by which Mr. Parr had made his\nfortune and gained his ascendency would not bear scrutiny.... Some of\nthem were disturbed, indeed, by the discovery that there had come about\nin them, by imperceptible degrees, in the last few years a new and\ncritical attitude towards the ways of modern finance: moat of them had\nan uncomfortable feeling that Hodder was somehow right,--a feeling\nwhich they sought to stifle when they reflected upon the consequences\nof facing it. For this would mean a disagreeable shaking up of their own\nlives. Few of them were in a position whence they might cast stones at\nEldon Parr....\n\nWhat these did not grasp was the fact that that which they felt stirring\nwithin them was the new and spiritual product of the dawning twentieth\ncentury--the Social Conscience. They wished heartily that the new rector\nwho had developed this disquieting personality would peacefully resign\nand leave them to the former, even tenor of their lives. They did not\nfor one moment doubt the outcome of his struggle with Eldon Parr. The\ngreat banker was known to be relentless, his name was synonymous with\nvictory. And yet, paradoxically, Hodder compelled their inner sympathy\nand admiration!...\n\nSome of them, who did not attempt peremptorily to choke the a processes\nmade the startling discovery that they were not, after all, so shocked\nby his doctrines as they had at first supposed. The trouble was that\nthey could not continue to listen to him, as formerly, with comfort....\nOne thing was certain, that they had never expected to look forward to a\nvestry meeting with such breathless interest and anxiety. This clergyman\nhad suddenly accomplished the surprising feat of reviving the Church as\na burning, vital factor in the life of the community! He had discerned\nher enemy, and defied his power....\n\nAs for Hodder, so absorbed had he been by his experiences, so wrung by\nthe human contacts, the personal problems which he had sought to enter,\nthat he had actually given no thought to the battle before him until the\nautumn afternoon, heavy with smoke, had settled down into darkness. The\nweather was damp and cold, and he sat musing on the ordeal now abruptly\nconfronting him before his study fire when he heard a step behind him.\nHe turned to recognize, by the glow of the embers, the heavy figure of\nNelson Langmaid.\n\n\"I hope I'm not disturbing you, Hodder,\" he said. \"The janitor said you\nwere in, and your door is open.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied the rector, rising. As he stood for a moment\nfacing the lawyer, the thought of their friendship, and how it had begun\nin the little rectory overlooking the lake at Bremerton, was uppermost\nin his mind,--yes, and the memory of many friendly, literary discussions\nin the same room where they now stood, of pleasant dinners at Langmaid's\nhouse in the West End, when the two of them had often sat talking until\nlate into the nights.\n\n\"I must seem very inhospitable,\" said Hodder. \"I'll light the lamp--it's\npleasanter than the electric light.\"\n\nThe added illumination at first revealed the lawyer in his familiar\naspect, the broad shoulders, the big, reddish beard, the dome-like\nhead,--the generous person that seemed to radiate scholarly benignity,\npeace, and good-will. But almost instantly the rector became aware of a\nnew and troubled, puzzled glance from behind the round spectacles...\n\n\"I thought I'd drop in a moment on my way up town--\" he began. And the\nnote of uncertainty in his voice, too, was new. Hodder drew towards\nthe fire the big chair in which it had been Langmaid's wont to sit,\nand perhaps it was the sight of this operation that loosed the lawyer's\ntongue.\n\n\"Confound it, Hodder!\" he exclaimed, \"I like you--I always have\nliked you. And you've got a hundred times the ability of the average\nclergyman. Why in the world did you have to go and make all this\ntrouble?\"\n\nBy so characteristic a remark Hodder was both amused and moved. It\nrevealed so perfectly the point of view and predicament of the\nlawyer, and it was also an expression of an affection which the rector\ncordially, returned.... Before answering, he placed his visitor in\nthe chair, and the deliberation of the act was a revelation of the\nunconscious poise of the clergyman. The spectacle of this self-command\non the brink of such a crucial event as the vestry meeting had taken\nLangmaid aback more than he cared to show. He had lost the old sense\nof comradeship, of easy equality; and he had the odd feeling of dealing\nwith a new man, at once familiar and unfamiliar, who had somehow lifted\nhimself out of the everyday element in which they heretofore had met.\nThe clergyman had contrived to step out of his, Langmaid's, experience:\nhad actually set him--who all his life had known no difficulty in\ndealing with men--to groping for a medium of communication....\n\nHodder sat down on the other side of the fireplace. He, too, seemed to\nbe striving for a common footing.\n\n\"It was a question of proclaiming the truth when at last I came to see\nit, Langmaid. I could not help doing what I did. Matters of policy, of\na false consideration for individuals could not enter into it. If this\nwere not so, I should gladly admit that you had a just grievance, a\npeculiar right to demand why I had not remained the strictly orthodox\nperson whom you induced to come here. You had every reason to\ncongratulate yourself that you were getting what you doubtless would\ncall a safe man.\"\n\n\"I'll admit I had a twinge of uneasiness after I came home,\" Langmaid\nconfessed.\n\nHodder smiled at his frankness.\n\n\"But that disappeared.\"\n\n\"Yes, it disappeared. You seemed to suit 'em so perfectly. I'll own up,\nHodder, that I was a little hurt that you did not come and talk to\nme just before you took the extraordinary--before you changed your\nopinions.\"\n\n\"Would it have done any good?\" asked the rector, gently. \"Would you have\nagreed with me any better than you do now? I am perfectly willing,\nif you wish, to discuss with you any views of mine which you may not\nindorse. And it would make me very happy, I assure you, if I could bring\nyou to look upon the matter as I do.\"\n\nThis was a poser. And whether it were ingenuous, or had in it an element\nof the scriptural wisdom of the serpent, Langmaid could not have said.\nAs a lawyer, he admired it.\n\n\"I wasn't in church, as usual,--I didn't hear the sermon,\" he replied.\n\"And I never could make head or tail of theology--I always told you\nthat. What I deplore, Hodder, is that you've contrived to make a\nhornets' nest out of the most peaceful and contented congregation in\nAmerica. Couldn't you have managed to stick to religion instead of\ngetting mixed up with socialism?\"\n\n\"So you have been given the idea that my sermon was socialistic?\" the\nrector said.\n\n\"Socialistic and heretical,--it seems. Of course I'm not much of an\nauthority on heresy, but they claim that you went out of your way to\nknock some of their most cherished and sacred beliefs in the head.\"\n\n\"But suppose I have come to the honest conclusion that in the first\nplace these so-called cherished beliefs have no foundation in fact, and\nno influence on the lives of the persons who cherished them, no real\nconnection with Christianity? What would you have me do, as a man?\nContinue to preach them for the sake of the lethargic peace of which you\nspeak? leave the church paralyzed, as I found it?\"\n\n\"Paralyzed! You've got the most influential people in the city.\"\n\nHodder regarded him for a while without replying.\n\n\"So has the Willesden Club,\" he said.\n\nLangmaid laughed a little, uncomfortably.\n\n\"If Christianity, as one of the ancient popes is said to have remarked,\nwere merely a profitable fable,\" the rector continued, \"there might be\nsomething in your contention that St. John's, as a church, had reached\nthe pinnacle of success. But let us ignore the spiritual side of this\nmatter as non-vital, and consider it from the practical side. We have\nthe most influential people in the city, but we have not their children.\nThat does not promise well for the future. The children get more profit\nout of the country clubs. And then there is another question: is it\ngoing to continue to be profitable? Is it as profitable now as it was,\nsay, twenty years ago?\n\n\"You've got out of my depth,\" said Nelson Langmaid.\n\n\"I'll try to explain. As a man of affairs, I think you will admit, if\nyou reflect, that the return of St. John's, considering the large amount\nof money invested, is scarcely worth considering. And I am surprised\nthat as astute a man as Mr. Pair has not been able to see this long\nago. If we clear all the cobwebs away, what is the real function of this\nchurch as at present constituted? Why this heavy expenditure to maintain\nreligious services for a handful of people? Is it not, when we come\ndown to facts, an increasingly futile effort to bring the influences of\nreligion--of superstition, if you will--to bear on the so-called lower\nclasses in order that they may remain contented with their lot, with\nthat station and condition in the world where--it is argued--it has\npleased God to call them? If that were not so, in my opinion there are\nvery few of the privileged classes who would invest a dollar in the\nChurch. And the proof of it is that the moment a clergyman raises his\nvoice to proclaim the true message of Christianity they are up in\narms with the cry of socialism. They have the sense to see that their\nprivileges are immediately threatened.\n\n\"Looking at it from the financial side, it would be cheaper for them to\nclose up their churches. It is a mere waste of time and money, because\nthe influence on their less fortunate brethren in a worldly sense has\ndwindled to nothing. Few of the poor come near their churches in these\ndays. The profitable fable is almost played out.\"\n\nHodder had spoken without bitterness, yet his irony was by no means lost\non the lawyer. Langmaid, if the truth be told, found himself for the\nmoment in the unusual predicament of being at a loss, for the rector had\nput forward with more or less precision the very cynical view which he\nhimself had been clever enough to evolve.\n\n\"Haven't they the right,\" he asked, somewhat lamely, \"to demand the kind\nof religion they pay for?\"\n\n\"Provided you don't call it religion,\" said the rector.\n\nLangmaid smiled in spite of himself.\n\n\"See here, Hodder,\" he said, \"I've always confessed frankly that I knew\nlittle or nothing about religion. I've come here this evening as your\nfriend, without authority from anybody,\" he added significantly, \"to see\nif this thing couldn't somehow be adjusted peaceably, for your sake as\nwell as others'. Come, you must admit there's a grain of justice in the\ncontention against you. When I went on to Bremerton to get you I had\nno real reason for supposing that these views would develop. I made a\ncontract with you in all good faith.\"\n\n\"And I with you,\" answered the rector. \"Perhaps you do not realize,\nLangmaid, what has been the chief factor in developing these views.\"\n\nThe lawyer was silent, from caution.\n\n\"I must be frank with you. It was the discovery that Mr. Parr and\nothers of my chief parishioners were so far from being Christians as to\nindulge, while they supported the Church of Christ, in operations like\nthat of the Consolidated Tractions Company, wronging their fellow-men\nand condemning them to misery and hate. And that you, as a lawyer, used\nyour talents to make that operation possible.\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" cried Langmaid, now plainly agitated. \"You have no right--you\ncan know nothing of that affair. You do not understand business.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" replied the rector, sadly, \"that I understand one side of\nit only too well.\"\n\n\"The Church has no right to meddle outside of her sphere, to dictate to\npolitics and business.\"\n\n\"Her sphere,\" said Holder, \"--is the world. If she does not change the\nworld by sending out Christians into it, she would better close her\ndoors.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't intend to quarrel with you, Holder. I suppose it can't be\nhelped that we look at these things differently, and I don't intend\nto enter into a defence of business. It would take too long, and it\nwouldn't help any.\" He got to his feet. \"Whatever happens, it won't\ninterfere with our personal friendship, even if you think me a\nhighwayman and I think you a--\"\n\n\"A fanatic,\" Holder supplied. He had risen, too, and stood, with a smile\non his face, gazing at the lawyer with an odd scrutiny.\n\n\"An idealist, I was going to say,\" Langmaid answered, returning the\nsmile, \"I'll admit that we need them in the world. It's only when one of\nthem gets in the gear-box....\"\n\nThe rector laughed. And thus they stood, facing each other.\n\n\"Langmaid,\" Holder asked, \"don't you ever get tired and disgusted with\nthe Juggernaut car?\"\n\nThe big lawyer continued to smile, but a sheepish, almost boyish\nexpression came over his face. He had not credited the clergyman with so\nmuch astuteness.\n\n\"Business, nowadays, is--business, Holder. The Juggernaut car claims us\nall. It has become-if you will permit me to continue to put my similes\ninto slang--the modern band wagon. And we lawyers have to get on it, or\nfall by the wayside.\"\n\nHolder stared into the fire.\n\n\"I appreciate your motive in coming here,\" he said, at length, \"and I\ndo you the justice of believing it was friendly, that the fact that you\nare, in a way, responsible for me to--to the congregation of St. John's\ndid not enter into it. I realize that I have made matters particularly\nawkward for you. You have given them in me, and in good faith, something\nthey didn't bargain for. You haven't said so, but you want me to resign.\nOn the one hand, you don't care to see me tilting at the windmills, or,\nbetter, drawing down on my head the thunderbolts of your gods. On the\nother hand, you are just a little afraid for your gods. If the question\nin dispute were merely an academic one, I'd accommodate you at once. But\nI can't. I've thought it all out, and I have made up my mind that it\nis my clear duty to remain here and, if I am strong enough, wrest this\nchurch from the grip of Eldon Parr and the men whom he controls.\n\n\"I am speaking plainly, and I understand the situation thoroughly. You\nwill probably tell me, as others have done, that no one has ever opposed\nEldon Parr who has not been crushed. I go in with my eyes open, I am\nwilling to be crushed, if necessary. You have come here to warn me, and\nI appreciate your motive. Now I am going to warn you, in all sincerity\nand friendship. I may be beaten, I may be driven out. But the victory\nwill be mine nevertheless. Eldon Parr and the men who stand with him in\nthe struggle will never recover from the blow I shall give them. I shall\nleave them crippled because I have the truth on my side, and the truth\nis irresistible. And they shall not be able to injure me permanently.\nAnd you, I regret deeply to say, will be hurt, too. I beg you, for no\nselfish reason, to consider again the part you intend to play in this\naffair.\"\n\nSuch was the conviction, such the unlooked-for fire with which the\nrector spoke that Langmaid was visibly shaken and taken aback in spite\nof himself.\n\n\"Do you mean,\" he demanded, when he had caught his breath, \"that you\nintend to attack us publicly?\"\n\n\"Is that the only punishment you can conceive of?\" the rector asked. The\nreproach in his voice was in itself a denial.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Hodder,\" said the lawyer, quickly. \"And I am sure\nyou honestly believe what you say, but--\"\n\n\"In your heart you, too, believe it, Langmaid. The retribution has\nalready begun. Nevertheless you will go on--for a while.\" He held out\nhis hand, which Langmaid took mechanically. \"I bear you no ill-will.\nI am sorry that you cannot yet see with sufficient clearness to save\nyourself.\"\n\nLangmaid turned and picked up his hat and stick and left the room\nwithout another word. The bewildered, wistful look which had replaced\nthe ordinarily benign and cheerful expression haunted Hodder long after\nthe lawyer had gone. It was the look of a man who has somehow lost his\nconsciousness of power.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. THE VESTRY MEETS\n\nAt nine o'clock that evening Hodder stood alone in the arched vestry\nroom, and the sight of the heavy Gothic chairs ranged about the long\ntable brought up memories of comfortable, genial meetings prolonged by\nchat and banter.... The noise of feet, of subdued voices beside the coat\nroom in the corridor, aroused him. All of the vestry would seem to have\narrived at once.\n\nHe regarded them with a detached curiosity as they entered, reading them\nwith a new insight. The trace of off-handedness in Mr. Plimpton's former\ncordiality was not lost upon him--an intimation that his star had set.\nMr. Plimpton had seen many breaches healed--had healed many himself. But\nhe had never been known as a champion of lost causes.\n\n\"Well, here we are, Mr. Hodder, on the stroke,\" he remarked. \"As a\nvestry, I think we're entitled to the first prize for promptness. How\nabout it, Everett?\"\n\nEverett Constable was silent.\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Hodder,\" he said. He did not offer to shake hands,\nas Mr. Plimpton had done, but sat down at the far end of the table.\nHe looked tired and worn; sick, the rector thought, and felt a sudden\nswelling of compassion for the pompous little man whose fibre was not\nas tough as that of these other condottieri: as Francis Ferguson's, for\ninstance, although his soft hand and pink and white face framed in the\nblack whiskers would seem to belie any fibre whatever.\n\nGordon Atterbury hemmed and hawed,--\"Ah, Mr. Hodder,\" and seated himself\nbeside Mr. Constable, in a chair designed to accommodate a portly\nbishop. Both of them started nervously as Asa Waring, holding his head\nhigh, as a man should who has kept his birthright, went directly to the\nrector.\n\n\"I'm glad to see you, Mr. Hodder,\" he said, and turning defiantly,\nsurveyed the room. There was an awkward silence. Mr. Plimpton edged\na little nearer. The decree might have gone forth for Mr. Hodder's\ndestruction, but Asa Waring was a man whose displeasure was not to be\nlightly incurred.\n\n\"What's this I hear about your moving out of Hamilton Place, Mr. Waring?\nYou'd better come up and take the Spaulding lot, in Waverley, across\nfrom us.\"\n\n\"I am an old man, Mr. Plimpton,\" Asa Waring replied. \"I do not move as\neasily as some other people in these days.\"\n\nEverett Constable produced his handkerchief and rubbed his nose\nviolently. But Mr. Plimpton was apparently undaunted.\n\n\"I have always said,\" he observed, \"that there was something very fine\nin your sticking to that neighbourhood after your friends had gone.\nHere's Phil!\"\n\nPhil Goodrich looked positively belligerent, and as he took his stand\non the other side of Hodder his father-in-law smiled at him grimly. Mr.\nGoodrich took hold of the rector's arm.\n\n\"I missed one or two meetings last spring, Mr. Hodder,\" he said, \"but\nI'm going to be on hand after this. My father, I believe, never missed\na vestry meeting in his life. Perhaps that was because they used to hold\nmost of 'em at his house.\"\n\n\"And serve port and cigars, I'm told,\" Mr. Plimpton put in.\n\n\"That was an inducement, Wallis, I'll admit,\" answered Phil. \"But there\nare even greater inducements now.\"\n\nIn view of Phil Goodrich's well-known liking for a fight, this was too\npointed to admit of a reply, but Mr. Plimpton was spared the attempt by\nthe entrance of. Nelson Langmaid. The lawyer, as he greeted them, seemed\nto be preoccupied, nor did he seek to relieve the tension with his\ncustomary joke. A few moments of silence followed, when Eldon Parr was\nseen to be standing in the doorway, surveying them.\n\n\"Good evening, gentlemen,\" he said coldly, and without more ado went to\nhis customary chair, and sat down in it. Immediately followed a scraping\nof other chairs. There was a dominating quality about the man not to be\ngainsaid.\n\nThe rector called the meeting to order....\n\nDuring the routine business none of the little asides occurred which\nproduce laughter. Every man in the room was aware of the intensity of\nEldon Parr's animosity, and yet he betrayed it neither by voice, look,\nor gesture. There was something uncanny in this self-control, this sang\nfroid with which he was wont to sit at boards waiting unmoved for the\ntime when he should draw his net about his enemies, and strangle them\nwithout pity. It got on Langmaid's nerves--hardened as he was to it. He\nhad seen many men in that net; some had struggled, some had taken their\nannihilation stoically; honest merchants, freebooters, and brigands.\nMost of them had gone out, with their families, into that precarious\nborder-land of existence in which the to-morrows are ever dreaded.\n\nYet here, somehow, was a different case. Langmaid found himself going\nback to the days when his mother had taken him to church, and he could\nnot bear to look at, Hodder. Since six o'clock that afternoon--had his\ncompanions but known it--he had passed through one of the worst periods\nof his existence....\n\nAfter the regular business had been disposed of a brief interval was\nallowed, for the sake of decency, to ensue. That Eldon Parr would not\nlead the charge in person was a foregone conclusion. Whom, then, would\nhe put forward? For obvious reasons, not Wallis Plimpton or Langmaid,\nnor Francis Ferguson. Hodder found his, glance unconsciously fixed\nupon Everett Constable, who, moved nervously and slowly pushed back his\nchair. He was called upon, in this hour and in the church his father had\nhelped to found, to make the supreme payment for the years of financial\nprosperity. Although a little man, with his shoulders thrown back and\nhis head high, he generally looked impressive when he spoke, and his\nfine features and clear-cut English contributed to the effect. But now\nhis face was strained, and his voice seemed to lack command as he bowed\nand mentioned the rector's name. Eldon Parr sat back.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Mr. Constable began, \"I feel it my duty to say something\nthis evening, something that distresses me. Like some of you who are\nhere present, I have been on this vestry for many years, and my father\nwas on it before me. I was brought up under Dr. Gilman, of whom I need\nnot speak. All here, except our present rector, knew him. This church,\nSt. John's, has been a part--a--large part--of my life. And anything\nthat seems to touch its welfare, touches me.\n\n\"When Dr. Gilman died, after so many years of faithful service, we faced\na grave problem,--that of obtaining a young man of ability, an active\nman who would be able to assume the responsibilities of a large and\ngrowing parish, and at the same time carry on its traditions, precious\nto us all; one who believed in and preached, I need scarcely add, the\naccepted doctrines of the Church, which we have been taught to think are\nsacred and necessary to salvation. And in the discovery of the Reverend\nMr. Hodder, we had reason to congratulate ourselves and the parish.\nHe was all that we had hoped for, and more. His sermons were at once a\npleasure and an instruction.\n\n\"I wish to make it clear,\" he continued, \"that in spite of the pain Mr.\nHodder's words of last Sunday have given me, I respect and honour him\nstill, and wish him every success. But, gentlemen, I think it is plain\nto all of you that he has changed his religious convictions. As to the\ncauses through which that change has come about, I do not pretend to\nknow. To say the least, the transition is a startling one, one for which\nsome of us were totally unprepared. To speak restrainedly, it was a\nshock--a shock which I shall remember as long as I live.\n\n\"I need not go into the doctrinal question here, except to express my\nopinion that the fundamental facts of our religion were contradicted.\nAnd we have also to consider the effect of this preaching on coming\ngenerations for whom we are responsible. There are, no doubt, other\nfields for Mr. Hodder's usefulness. But I think it may safely be taken\nas a principle that this parish has the right to demand from the\npulpit that orthodox teaching which suits it, and to which it has been\naccustomed. And I venture further to give it as my opinion--to put it\nmildly that others have been as disturbed and shocked as I. I have\nseen many, talked with many, since Sunday. For these reasons, with much\nsorrow and regret, I venture to suggest to the vestry that Mr. Hodder\nresign as our rector. And I may add what I believe to be the feeling\nof all present, that we have nothing but good will for him, although we\nthink we might have been informed of what he intended to do.\n\n\"And that in requesting him to resign we are acting for his own good as\nwell as our own, and are thus avoiding a situation which threatens to\nbecome impossible,--one which would bring serious reflection on him\nand calamity on the church. We already, in certain articles in the\nnewspapers, have had an indication of the intolerable notoriety we may\nexpect, although I hold Mr. Hodder innocent in regard to those articles.\nI am sure he will have the good sense to see this situation as I see it,\nas the majority of the parish see it.\"\n\nMr. Constable sat down, breathing hard. He had not looked at the rector\nduring the whole of his speech, nor at Eldon Parr. There was a heavy\nsilence, and then Philip Goodrich rose, square, clean-cut, aggressive.\n\n\"I, too, gentlemen, have had life-long association with this church,\" he\nbegan deliberately. \"And for Mr. Hodder's sake I am going to give you a\nlittle of my personal history, because I think it typical of thousands\nof men of my age all over this country. It was nobody's fault, perhaps,\nthat I was taught that the Christian religion depended on a certain\nseries of nature miracles and a chain of historical events, and when I\nwent East to school I had more of this same sort of instruction. I have\nnever, perhaps, been overburdened with intellect, but the time arrived\nnevertheless when I began to think for myself. Some of the older boys\nwent once, I remember, to the rector of the school--a dear old man--and\nfrankly stated our troubles. To use a modern expression, he stood pat on\neverything. I do not say it was a consciously criminal act, he probably\nsaw no way out himself. At any rate, he made us all agnostics at one\nstroke.\n\n\"What I learned in college of science and history and philosophy merely\nconfirmed me in my agnosticism. As a complete system for the making of\natheists and materialists, I commend the education which I received. If\nthere is any man here who believes religion to be an essential factor\nin life, I ask him to think of his children or grandchildren before he\ncomes forward to the support of Mr. Constable.\n\n\"In that sermon which he preached last Sunday, Mr. Hodder, for the first\ntime in my life, made Christianity intelligible to me. I want him to\nknow it. And there are other men and women in that congregation who\nfeel as I do. Gentlemen, there is nothing I would not give to have had\nChristianity put before me in that simple and inspiring way when I was a\nboy. And in my opinion St. John's is more fortunate to-day than it\never has been in its existence. Mr. Hodder should have an unanimous\ntestimonial of appreciation from this vestry for his courage. And if the\nvote requesting him to resign prevails, I venture to predict that there\nis not a man on this vestry who will not live to regret it.\"\n\nPhil Goodrich glared at Eldon Parr, who remained unmoved.\n\n\"Permit me to add,\" he said, \"that this controversy, in other respects\nthan doctrine, is more befitting to the Middle Ages than to the\ntwentieth century, when this Church and other denominations are passing\nresolutions in their national conventions with a view to unity and\nfreedom of belief.\"\n\nMr. Langmaid, Mr. Plimpton, and Mr. Constable sat still. Mr. Ferguson\nmade no move. It was Gordon Atterbury who rushed into the breach, and\nproved that the extremists are allies of doubtful value.\n\nHe had, apparently, not been idle since Sunday, and was armed cap-a pie\nwith time-worn arguments that need not be set down. All of which went to\nshow that Mr. Goodrich had not referred to the Middle Ages in vain. For\nGordon Atterbury was a born school-man. But he finished by declaring, at\nthe end of twenty minutes (much as he regretted the necessity of saying\nit), that Mr. Hodder's continuance as rector would mean the ruin of the\nchurch in which all present took such a pride. That the great majority\nof its members would never submit to what was so plainly heresy.\n\nIt was then that Mr. Plimpton gathered courage to pour oil on the\nwaters. There was nothing, in his opinion, he remarked smilingly, in\nhis function as peacemaker, to warrant anything but the most friendly\ninterchange of views. He was second to none in his regard for Mr.\nHodder, in his admiration for a man who had the courage of his\nconvictions. He had not the least doubt that Mr. Hodder did not desire\nto remain in the parish when it was so apparent that the doctrines which\nhe now preached were not acceptable to most of those who supported\nthe church. And he added (with sublime magnanimity) that he wished Mr.\nHodder the success which he was sure he deserved, and gave him every\nassurance of his friendship.\n\nAsa Waring was about to rise, when he perceived that Hodder himself\nwas on his feet. And the eyes of every man, save one, were fixed on him\nirresistibly. The rector seemed unaware of it. It was Philip Goodrich\nwho remarked to his father-in-law, as they walked home afterwards, of\nthe sense he had had at that moment that there were just two men in the\nroom,--Hodder and Eldon Parr. All the rest were ciphers; all had lost,\nmomentarily, their feelings of partisanship and were conscious only of\nthese two intense, radiating, opposing centres of force; and no man,\noddly enough, could say which was the stronger. They seemingly met on\nequal terms. There could not be the slightest doubt that the rector\ndid not mean to yield, and yet they might have been puzzled if they had\nasked themselves how they had read the fact in his face or manner. For\nhe betrayed neither anger nor impatience.\n\nNo more did the financier reveal his own feelings. He still sat back in\nhis chair, unmoved, in apparent contemplation. The posture was familiar\nto Langmaid.\n\nWould he destroy, too, this clergyman? For the first time in his life,\nand as he looked at Hodder, the lawyer wondered. Hodder did not defend\nhimself, made no apologies. Christianity was not a collection of\ndoctrines, he reminded them,--but a mode of life. If anything were clear\nto him, it was that the present situation was not, with the majority of\nthem, a matter of doctrines, but of unwillingness to accept the message\nand precept of Jesus Christ, and lead Christian lives. They had made use\nof the doctrines as a stalking-horse.\n\nThere was a stir at this, and Hodder paused a moment and glanced around\nthe table. But no one interrupted.\n\nHe was fully aware of his rights, and he had no intention of resigning.\nTo resign would be to abandon the work for which he was responsible, not\nto them, but to God. And he was perfectly willing--nay, eager to defend\nhis Christianity before any ecclesiastical court, should the bishop\ndecide that a court was necessary. The day of freedom, of a truer vision\nwas at hand, the day of Christian unity on the vital truths, and no\nbetter proof of it could be brought forward than the change in him. In\nhis ignorance and blindness he had hitherto permitted compromise, but he\nwould no longer allow those who made only an outward pretence of being\nChristians to direct the spiritual affairs of St. John's, to say what\nshould and what should not be preached. This was to continue to paralyze\nthe usefulness of the church, to set at naught her mission, to alienate\nthose who most had need of her, who hungered and thirsted after\nrighteousness, and went away unsatisfied.\n\nHe had hardly resumed his seat when Everett Constable got up again. He\nremarked, somewhat unsteadily, that to prolong the controversy would be\nuseless and painful to all concerned, and he infinitely regretted the\nnecessity of putting his suggestion that the rector resign in the form\nof a resolution.... The vote was taken. Six men raised their hands in\nfavour of his resignation--Nelson Langmaid among them: two, Asa Waring\nand Philip Goodrich, were against it. After announcing the result,\nHodder rose.\n\n\"For the reason I have stated, gentlemen, I decline to resign,\" he said.\n\"I stand upon my canonical rights.\"\n\nFrancis Ferguson arose, his voice actually trembling with anger. There\nis something uncanny in the passion of a man whose life has been ordered\nby the inexorable rules of commerce, who has been wont to decide all\nquestions from the standpoint of dollars and cents. If one of his own\nwax models had suddenly become animated, the effect could not have been\nmore startling.\n\nIn the course of this discussion, he declared, Mr. Hodder had seen fit\nto make grave and in his opinion unwarranted charges concerning the\nlives of some, if not all, of the gentlemen who sat here. It surprised\nhim that these remarks had not been resented, but he praised a Christian\nforbearance on the part of his colleagues which he was unable to\nachieve. He had no doubt that their object had been to spare Mr.\nHodder's feelings as much as possible, but Mr. Hodder had shown no\ndisposition to spare their own. He had outraged them, Mr. Ferguson\nthought,--wantonly so. He had made these preposterous and unchristian\ncharges an excuse for his determination to remain in a position where\nhis usefulness had ceased.\n\nNo one, unfortunately, was perfect in this life,--not even Mr. Hodder.\nHe, Francis Ferguson, was far from claiming to be so. But he believed\nthat this arraignment of the men who stood highest in the city for\ndecency, law, and order, who supported the Church, who revered its\ndoctrines, who tried to live Christian lives, who gave their time and\ntheir money freely to it and to charities, that this arraignment was an\narrogant accusation and affront to be repudiated. He demanded that Mr.\nHodder be definite. If he had any charges to make, let him make them\nhere and now.\n\nThe consternation, the horror which succeeded such a stupid and\nunexpected tactical blunder on the part of the usually astute Mr.\nFerguson were felt rather than visually discerned. The atmosphere might\nhave been described as panicky. Asa Waring and Phil Goodrich smiled as\nWallis Plimpton, after a moment's hush, scrambled to his feet, his\nface pale, his customary easiness and nonchalance now the result of an\nobvious effort. He, too, tried to smile, but swallowed instead as he\nremembered his property in Dalton Street.... Nelson Langmaid smiled,\nin spite of himself... Mr. Plimpton implored his fellow-members not to\nbring personalities into the debate, and he was aware all the while of\nthe curious, pitying expression of the rector. He breathed a sigh of\nrelief at the opening words of Hodder, who followed him.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I have no intention of being personal, even\nby unanimous consent. But if Mr. Ferguson will come to me after this\nmeeting I shall have not the least objection to discussing this matter\nwith him in so far as he himself is concerned. I can only assure you now\nthat I have not spoken without warrant.\"\n\nThere was, oddly enough, no acceptance of this offer by Mr. Ferguson.\nAnother silence ensued, broken, at last, by a voice for which they had\nall been unconsciously waiting; a voice which, though unemotional, cold,\nand matter-of-fact, was nevertheless commanding, and long accustomed to\nspeak with an overwhelming authority. Eldon Parr did not rise.\n\n\"Mr. Hodder,\" he said, \"in one respect seems to be under the delusion\nthat we are still in the Middle Ages, instead of the twentieth century,\nsince he assumes the right to meddle with the lives of his parishioners,\nto be the sole judge of their actions. That assumption will not, be\ntolerated by free men. I, for one, gentlemen, do not, propose to have a\nsocialist for the rector of the church which I attend and support. And\nI maintain the privilege of an American citizen to set my own standards,\nwithin the law, and to be the sole arbitrar of those standards.\"\n\n\"Good!\" muttered Gordon Atterbury. Langmaid moved uncomfortably.\n\n\"I shall not waste words,\" the financier continued. \"There is in my\nmind no question that we are justified in demanding from our rector the\nChristian doctrines to which we have given our assent, and which are\nstated in the Creeds. That they shall be subject to the whims of the\nrector is beyond argument. I do not pretend to, understand either,\ngentlemen, the nature of the extraordinary change that has taken place\nin the rector of St. John's. I am not well versed m psychology. I am\nincapable of flights myself. One effect of this change is an attitude on\nwhich reasonable considerations would seem to have no effect.\n\n\"Our resources, fortunately, are not yet at an end. It has been my\nhope, on account of my former friendship with Mr. Hodder, that an\necclesiastical trial might not be necessary. It now seems inevitable.\nIn the meantime, since Mr. Hodder has seen fit to remain in spite of\nour protest, I do not intend to enter this church. I was prepared,\ngentlemen, as some of you no doubt know, to spend a considerable sum in\nadding to the beauty of St. John's and to the charitable activities of\nthe parish. Mr. Hodder has not disapproved of my gifts in the past,\nbut owing to his present scruples concerning my worthiness, I naturally\nhesitate to press the matter now.\" Mr. Parr indulged in the semblance of\na smile. \"I fear that he must take the responsibility of delaying this\nbenefit, with the other responsibilities he has assumed.\"\n\nHis voice changed. It became sharper.\n\n\"In short, I propose to withhold all contributions for whatever purpose\nfrom this church while Mr. Hodder is rector, and I advise those of you\nwho have voted for his resignation to do the same. In the meantime, I\nshall give my money to Calvary, and attend its services. And I shall\noffer further a resolution--which I am informed is within our right--to\ndiscontinue Mr. Hodder's salary.\"\n\nThere was that in the unparalleled audacity of Eldon Parr that compelled\nHodder's unwilling admiration. He sat gazing at the financier during\nthis speech, speculating curiously on the inner consciousness of the man\nwho could utter it. Was it possible that he had no sense of guilt? Even\nso, he had shown a remarkable astuteness in relying on the conviction\nthat he (Hodder) would not betray what he knew.\n\nHe was suddenly aware that Asa Waring was standing beside him.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Waring, \"I have listened to this discussion as\nlong as I can bear it with patience. Had I been told of it, I should\nhave thought it incredible that the methods of the money changers should\nbe applied to the direction and control of the house of God. In my\nopinion there is but one word which is suitable for what has passed here\nto-night, and the word is persecution. Perhaps I have lived too long\nI have lived to see honourable, upright men deprived of what was\nrightfully theirs, driven from their livelihood by the rapacity of those\nwho strive to concentrate the wealth and power of the nation into their\nhands. I have seen this power gathering strength, stretching its arm\nlittle by little over the institutions I fought to preserve, and which\nI cherish over our politics, over our government, yes, and even over\nour courts. I have seen it poisoning the business honour in which we\nformerly took such a pride, I have seen it reestablishing a slavery\nmore pernicious than that which millions died to efface. I have seen\nit compel a subservience which makes me ashamed, as an American, to\nwitness.\"\n\nHis glance, a withering moral scorn, darted from under the grizzled\neyebrows and alighted on one man after another, and none met it. Everett\nConstable coughed, Wallis Plimpton shifted his position, the others sat\nlike stones. Asa Waring was giving vent at last to the pent-up feelings\nof many years.\n\n\"And now that power, which respects nothing, has crept into the\nsanctuary of the Church. Our rector recognizes it, I recognize\nit,--there is not a man here who, in his heart, misunderstands me. And\nwhen a man is found who has the courage to stand up against it, I honour\nhim with all my soul, and a hope that was almost dead revives in me. For\nthere is one force, and one force alone, able to overcome the power of\nwhich I speak,--the Spirit of Christ. And the mission of the Church is\nto disseminate that spirit. The Church is the champion on which we\nhave to rely, or give up all hope of victory. The Church must train the\nrecruits. And if the Church herself is betrayed into the hands of the\nenemy, the battle is lost.\n\n\"If Mr. Hodder is forced out of this church, it would be better to lock\nthe doors. St. John's will be held up, and rightfully, to the scorn of\nthe city. All the money in the world will not save her. Though crippled,\nshe has survived one disgrace, when she would not give free shelter to\nthe man who above all others expressed her true spirit, when she drove\nHorace Bentley from her doors after he had been deprived of the fortune\nwhich he was spending for his fellow-men. She will not survive another.\n\n\"I have no doubt Mr. Parr's motion to take from Mr. Hodder his living\nwill go through. And still I urge him not to resign. I am not a rich\nman, even when such property as I have is compared to moderate fortunes\nof these days, but I would pay his salary willingly out of my own pocket\nrather than see him go....\n\n\"I call the attention of the Chairman,\" said Eldon Parr, after a certain\ninterval in which no one had ventured to speak, \"to the motion before\nthe vestry relating to the discontinuance of Mr. Hodder's salary.\"\n\nIt was then that the unexpected happened. Gordon Atterbury redeemed\nhimself. His respect for Mr. Waring, he said, made him hesitate to take\nissue with him.\n\nHe could speak for himself and for a number of people in the\ncongregation when he reiterated his opinion that they were honestly\nshocked at what Mr. Hodder had preached, and that this was his sole\nmotive in requesting Mr. Hodder to resign. He thought, under the\ncircumstances, that this was a matter which might safely be left with\nthe bishop. He would not vote to deprive Mr. Hodder of his salary.\n\nThe motion was carried by a vote of five to three. For Eldon Parr well\nknew that his will needed no reenforcement by argument. And this much\nwas to be said for him, that after he had entered a battle he never\nhesitated, never under any circumstances reconsidered the probable\neffect of his course.\n\nAs for the others, those who had supported him, they were cast in a less\nheroic mould. Even Francis Ferguson. As between the devil and the deep\nsea, he was compelled, with as good a grace as possible, to choose the\ndevil. He was utterly unable to contemplate the disaster which might\nensue if certain financial ties, which were thicker than cables, were\nsnapped. But his affection for the devil was not increased by thus being\nled into a charge from which he would willingly have drawn back. Asa\nWaring might mean nothing to Eldon Parr, but he meant a great deal\nto Francis Ferguson, who had by no means forgotten his sensations of\nsatisfaction when Mrs. Waring had made her first call in Park Street\non Francis Ferguson's wife. He left the room in such a state of\nabsent-mindedness as actually to pass Mr. Parr in the corridor without\nspeaking to him.\n\nThe case of Wallis Plimpton was even worse. He had married the Gores,\nbut he had sought to bind himself with hoops of steel to the Warings.\nHe had always secretly admired that old Roman quality (which the\nGoodriches--their connections--shared) of holding fast to their\ncourse unmindful and rather scornful of influence which swayed their\nneighbours. The clan was sufficient unto itself, satisfied with a\nmoderate prosperity and a continually increasing number of descendants.\nThe name was unstained. Such are the strange incongruities in the\nhearts of men, that few realized the extent to which Wallis Plimpton\nhad partaken of the general hero-worship of Phil Goodrich. He had\nassiduously cultivated his regard, at times discreetly boasted of it,\nand yet had never been sure of it. And now fate, in the form of his\nmaster, Eldon Parr had ironically compelled him at one stroke to undo\nthe work of years. As soon as the meeting broke up, he crossed the room.\n\n\"I can't tell you how much I regret this, Phil,\" he said. \"Charlotte has\nvery strong convictions, you know, and so have I. You can understand,\nI am sure, how certain articles of belief might be necessary to one\nperson, and not to another.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Phil, \"I can understand. We needn't mention the articles,\nWallis.\" And he turned his back.\n\nHe never knew the pain he inflicted. Wallis Plimpton looked at the\nrector, who stood talking to Mr. Waring, and for the first time in his\nlife recoiled from an overture.\n\nSomething in the faces of both men warned him away.\n\nEven Everett Constable, as they went home in the cars together, was\nbrief with him, and passed no comments when Mr. Plimpton recovered\nsufficiently to elaborate on the justification of their act, and upon\nthe extraordinary stand taken by Phil Goodrich and Mr. Waring.\n\n\"They might have told us what they were going to do.\"\n\nEverett Constable eyed him.\n\n\"Would it have made any difference, Plimpton?\" he demanded.\n\nAfter that they rode in silence, until they came to a certain West End\ncorner, where they both descended. Little Mr. Constable's sensations\nwere, if anything, less enviable, and he had not Mr. Plimpton's\nrecuperative powers. He had sold that night, for a mess of pottage, the\nfriendship and respect of three generations. And he had fought, for pay,\nagainst his own people.\n\nAnd lastly, there was Langmaid, whose feelings almost defy analysis. He\nchose to walk through the still night the four miles--that separated\nhim from his home. And he went back over the years of his life until he\nfound, in the rubbish of the past, a forgotten and tarnished jewel. The\ndiscovery pained him. For that jewel was the ideal he had carried away,\nas a youth, from the old law school at the bottom of Hamilton Place,--a\ngift from no less a man than the great lawyer and public-spirited\ncitizen, Judge Henry Goodrich--Philip Goodrich's grandfather,\nwhose seated statue marked the entrance of the library. He, Nelson\nLangmaid,--had gone forth from that school resolved to follow in the\nfootsteps of that man,--but somehow he missed the path. Somehow\nthe jewel had lost its fire. There had come a tempting offer, and\na struggle--just one: a readjustment on the plea that the world had\nchanged since the days of Judge Goodrich, whose uncompromising figure\nhad begun to fade: an exciting discovery that he, Nelson Langmaid,\npossessed the gift of drawing up agreements which had the faculty of\npassing magically through the meshes of the Statutes. Affluence had\nfollowed, and fame, and even that high office which the Judge himself\nhad held, the Presidency of the State Bar Association. In all that time,\none remark, which he had tried to forget, had cut him to the quick.\nBedloe Hubbell had said on the political platform that Langmaid got one\nhundred thousand dollars a year for keeping Eldon Parr out of jail.\n\nOnce he stopped in the street, his mind suddenly going back to the\naction of the financier at the vestry meeting.\n\n\"Confound him!\" he said aloud, \"he has been a fool for once. I told him\nnot to do it.\"\n\nHe stood at last in the ample vestibule of his house, singling out\nhis latch-key, when suddenly the door opened, and his daughter Helen\nappeared.\n\n\"Oh, dad,\" she cried, \"why are you so-late? I've been watching for you.\nI know you've let Mr. Hodder stay.\"\n\nShe gazed at him with widened eyes.\n\n\"Don't tell me that you've made him resign. I can't--I won't believe\nit.\"\n\n\"He isn't going to resign, Helen,\" Langmaid replied, in an odd voice.\n\n\"He--he refused to.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. \"RISE, CROWNED WITH LIGHT!\"\n\n\nI\n\nThe Church of St. John's, after a peaceful existence of so many years,\nhad suddenly become the stage on which rapid and bewildering dramas were\nplayed: the storm-centre of chaotic forces, hitherto unperceived, drawn\nfrom the atmosphere around her. For there had been more publicity, more\nadvertising. \"The Rector of St. John's will not talk\"--such had been\none headline: neither would the vestry talk. And yet, despite all this\nsecrecy, the whole story of the suspension of Hodder's salary was in\nprint, and an editorial (which was sent to him) from a popular and\nsensational journal, on \"tainted money,\" in which Hodder was held up to\nthe public as a martyr because he refused any longer to accept for the\nChurch ill-gotten gains from Consolidated Tractions and the like.\n\nThis had opened again the floodgates of the mails, and it seemed as\nthough every person who had a real or fancied grievance against Eldon\nParr had written him. Nor did others of his congregation escape. The\npress of visitors at the parish house suddenly increased once more, men\nand women came to pour into his ears an appalling aeries of confessions;\nwrongs which, like Garvin's, had engendered bitter hatreds; woes,\ntemptations, bewilderments. Hodder strove to keep his feet, sought\nwisdom to deal patiently with all, though at times he was tried to the\nuttermost. And he held steadfastly before his mind the great thing, that\nthey did come. It was what he had longed for, prayed for, despaired of.\nHe was no longer crying in the empty wilderness, but at last in touch-in\nnatural touch with life: with life in all its sorrow, its crudity and\nhorror. He had contrived, by the grace of God, to make the connection\nfor his church.\n\nThat church might have been likened to a ship sailing out of the snug\nharbour in which she had lain so long to range herself gallantly beside\nthose whom she had formerly beheld, with complacent cowardice, fighting\nher fight: young men and women, enlisted under other banners than\nher own, doing their part in the battle of the twentieth century for\nhumanity. Her rector was her captain. It was he who had cut her cables,\nquelled, for a time at least, her mutineers; and sought to hearten\nthose of her little crew who wavered, who shrank back appalled as they\nrealized something of the immensity of the conflict in which her destiny\nwas to be wrought out.\n\nTo carry on the figure, Philip Goodrich might have been deemed her first\nofficer. He, at least, was not appalled, but grimly conscious of the\ngreatness of the task to which they had set their hands. The sudden\ntransformation of conservative St. John's was no more amazing than that\nof the son of a family which had never been without influence in the\ncommunity. But that influence had always been conservative. And Phil\nGoodrich had hitherto taken but a listless interest in the church of his\nfathers. Fortune had smiled upon him, trusts had come to him unsought.\nHe had inherited the family talent for the law, the freedom to practise\nwhen and where he chose. His love of active sport had led him into many\nvacations, when he tramped through marsh and thicket after game, and at\nfive and forty there was not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his hard\nbody. In spite of his plain speaking, an overwhelming popularity at\ncollege had followed him to his native place, and no organization,\nsporting or serious, was formed in the city that the question was not\nasked, \"What does Goodrich think about it?\"\n\nHis whole-souled enlistment in the cause of what was regarded as radical\nreligion became, therefore, the subject of amazed comment in the\nmany clubs he now neglected. The \"squabble\" in St. John's, as it was\ngenerally referred to, had been aired in the press, but such was the\nmagic in a name made without conscious effort that Phil Goodrich's\nparticipation in the struggle had a palpably disarming effect: and\nthere were not a few men who commonly spent their Sunday mornings behind\nplate-glass windows, surrounded by newspapers, as well as some in the\nathletic club (whose contests Mr. Goodrich sometimes refereed) who\nwent to St. John's out of curiosity and who waited, afterwards, for\nan interview with Phil or the rector. The remark of one of these was\ntypical of others. He had never taken much stock in religion, but if\nGoodrich went in for it he thought he'd go and look it over.\n\nScarcely a day passed that Phil did not drop in at the parish house....\nAnd he set himself, with all the vigour of an unsquandered manhood, to\nhelp Hodder to solve the multitude of new problems by which they were\nbeset.\n\nA free church was a magnificent ideal, but how was it to be carried on\nwithout an Eldon Parr, a Ferguson, a Constable, a Mrs. Larrabbee, or a\nGore who would make up the deficit at the end of the year? Could weekly\ncontributions, on the envelope system, be relied upon, provided the\npeople continued to come and fill the pews of absent and outraged\nparishioners? The music was the most expensive in the city, although\nMr. Taylor, the organist, had come to the rector and offered to cut his\nsalary in half, and to leave that in abeyance until the finances could\nbe adjusted. And his example had been followed by some of the high-paid\nmen in the choir. Others had offered to sing without pay. And there were\nthe expenses of the parish house, an alarming sum now Eldon Parr had\nwithdrawn: the salaries of the assistants. Hodder, who had saved a\ncertain sum in past years, would take nothing for the present.... Asa\nWaring and Phil Goodrich borrowed on their own responsibility...\n\n\n\nII\n\nSomething of the overwhelming nature of the forces Hodder had summoned\nwas visibly apparent on that first Sunday after what many had called\nhis apostasy. Instead of the orderly, sprucely-dressed groups of people\nwhich were wont to linger in greetings before the doors of St. John's,\na motley crowd thronged the pavement and streamed into the church,\npressing up the aisles and invading the sacred precincts where decorous\nparishioners had for so many years knelt in comfort and seclusion. The\nfamiliar figure of Gordon Atterbury was nowhere to be seen, and the\nAtterbury pew was occupied by shop-girls in gaudy hats. Eldon Parr's pew\nwas filled, Everett Constable's, Wallis Plimpton's; and the ushers\nwho had hastily been mustered were awestricken and powerless. Such a\nresistless invasion by the hordes of the unknown might well have struck\nwith terror some of those who hitherto had had the courage to\nstandup loyally in the rector's support. It had a distinct flavour of\nrevolution: contained, for some, a grim suggestion of a time when that\nvague, irresponsible, and restless monster, the mob, would rise in its\nmight and brutally and inexorably take possession of all property.\n\nAlison had met Eleanor Goodrich in Burton Street, and as the two made\ntheir way into the crowded vestibule they encountered Martha Preston,\nwhose husband was Alison's cousin, in the act of flight.\n\n\"You're not going in!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Of course we are.\"\n\nMrs. Preston stared at Alison in amazement.\n\n\"I didn't know you were still here,\" she said, irrelevantly. \"I'm pretty\nliberal, my dear, as you know,--but this is more than I can stand. Look\nat them!\" She drew up her skirts as a woman brushed against her. \"I\nbelieve in the poor coming to church, and all that, but this is mere\nvulgar curiosity, the result of all that odious advertising in the\nnewspapers. My pew is filled with them. If I had stayed, I should have\nfainted. I don't know what to think of Mr. Hodder.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hodder is not to blame for the newspapers,\" replied Alison, warmly.\nShe glanced around her at the people pushing past, her eyes shining, her\ncolour high, and there was the ring of passion in her voice which had do\nMartha Preston a peculiarly disquieting effect. \"I think it's splendid\nthat they are here at all! I don't care what brought them.\"\n\nMrs. Preston stared again. She was a pretty, intelligent woman, at\nwhose dinner table one was sure to hear the discussion of some \"modern\nproblem\": she believed herself to be a socialist. Her eyes sought\nEleanor Goodrich's, who stood by, alight with excitement.\n\n\"But surely you, Eleanor-you're not going in! You'll never be able to\nstand it, even if you find a seat. The few people we know who've come\nare leaving. I just saw the Allan Pendletons.\"\n\n\"Have you seen Phil?\" Eleanor asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes, he's in there, and even he's helpless. And as I came out poor\nMr. Bradley was jammed up against the wall. He seemed perfectly\nstunned....\"\n\nAt this moment they were thrust apart. Eleanor quivered as she was\ncarried through the swinging doors into the church.\n\n\"I think you're right,\" she whispered to Alison, \"it is splendid.\nThere's something about it that takes hold of me, that carries one away.\nIt makes me wonder how it can be guided--what will come of it?\"\n\nThey caught sight of Phil pushing his way towards them, and his face\nbore the set look of belligerency which Eleanor knew so well, but he\nreturned her smile. Alison's heart warmed towards him.\n\n\"What do you think of this?\" he demanded. \"Most of our respectable\nfriends who dared to come have left in a towering rage--to institute\nlawsuits, probably. At tiny rate, strangers are not being made to wait\nuntil ten minutes after the service begins. That's one barbarous custom\nabolished.\"\n\n\"Strangers seem to have taken matters in their own hands for once\"\nEleanor smiled. \"We've made up our minds to stay, Phil, even if we have\nto stand.\"\n\n\"That's the right spirit,\" declared her husband, glancing at Alison, who\nhad remained silent, with approval and by no means a concealed surprise.\n\"I think I know of a place where I can squeeze you in, near Professor\nBridges and Sally, on the side aisle.\"\n\n\"Are George and Sally here?\" Eleanor exclaimed.\n\n\"Hodder,\" said Phil, \"is converting the heathen. You couldn't have kept\nGeorge away. And it was George who made Sally stay!\"\n\nPresently they found themselves established between a rawboned young\nworkingman who smelled strongly of soap, whose hair was plastered\ntightly against his forehead, and a young woman who leaned against the\nwall. The black in which she was dressed enhanced the whiteness and\nweariness of her face, and she sat gazing ahead of her, apparently\nunconscious of those who surrounded her, her hands tightly folded in her\nlap. In their immediate vicinity, indeed, might have been found all the\nvariety of type seen in the ordinary street car. And in truth there were\nsome who seemed scarcely to realize they were not in a public vehicle.\nAn elaborately dressed female in front of them, whose expansive hat\nbrushed her neighbours, made audible comments to a stout man with a red\nneck which was set in a crease above his low collar.\n\n\"They tell me Eldon Parr's pew has a gold plate on it. I wish I knew\nwhich it was. It ain't this one, anyway, I'll bet.\"\n\n\"Say, they march in in this kind of a church, don't they?\" some one said\nbehind them.\n\nEleanor, with her lips tightly pressed, opened her prayer book. Alison's\nlips were slightly parted as she gazed about her, across the aisle. Her\nexperience of the Sunday before, deep and tense as it had been, seemed\nas nothing compared to this; the presence of all these people stimulated\nher inexpressibly, fired her; and she felt the blood pulsing through\nher body as she contrasted this gathering with the dignified, scattered\ncongregation she had known. She scarcely recognized the church itself\n... She speculated on the homes from which these had come, and the\nmotives which had brought them.\n\nFor a second the perfume of the woman in front, mingling with other less\ndefinable odours, almost sickened her, evoking suggestions of tawdry,\ntrivial, vulgar lives, fed on sensation and excitement; but the feeling\nwas almost immediately swept away by a renewed sense of the bigness of\nthe thing which she beheld,--of which, indeed, she was a part. And her\nthoughts turned more definitely to the man who had brought it all about.\nCould he control it, subdue it? Here was Opportunity suddenly upon him,\nlike a huge, curving, ponderous wave. Could he ride it? or would it\ncrush him remorselessly?\n\nSensitive, alert, quickened as she was, she began to be aware of other\nvalues: of the intense spiritual hunger in the eyes of the woman in\nblack, the yearning of barren, hopeless existences. And here and there\nAlison's look fell upon more prosperous individuals whose expressions\nproclaimed incredulity, a certain cynical amusement at the spectacle:\nothers seemed uneasy, as having got more than they had bargained for,\ndeliberating whether to flee... and then, just as her suspense was\nbecoming almost unbearable, the service began....\n\nHow it had been accomplished, the thing she later felt, was beyond the\nrange of intellectual analysis. Nor could she have told how much later,\nsince the passage of time had gone unnoticed. Curiosities, doubts,\npassions, longings, antagonisms--all these seemed--as the most natural\nthing in the world--to have been fused into one common but ineffable\nemotion. Such, at least, was the impression to which Alison startlingly\nawoke. All the while she had been conscious of Hodder, from the moment\nshe had heard his voice in the chancel; but somehow this consciousness\nof him had melted, imperceptibly, into that of the great congregation,\nonce divided against itself, which had now achieved unity of soul.\n\nThe mystery as to how this had been effected was the more elusive when\nshe considered the absence of all methods which might have been deemed\nrevivalistic. Few of those around her evinced a familiarity with\nthe historic service. And then occurred to her his explanation of\npersonality as the medium by which all truth is revealed, by which the\ncurrent of religion, the motive power in all history, is transmitted.\nSurely this was the explanation, if it might be called one! That\ntingling sense of a pervading spirit which was his,--and yet not his. He\nwas the incandescent medium, and yet, paradoxically, gained in identity\nand individuality and was inseparable from the thing itself.\n\nShe could not see him. A pillar hid the chancel from her view.\n\nThe service, to which she had objected as archaic, became subordinate,\nspiritualized, dominated by the personality. Hodder had departed from\nthe usual custom by giving out the page of the psalter: and the verses,\nthe throbbing responses which arose from every corner of the church,\nassumed a new significance, the vision of the ancient seer revived. One\nverse he read resounded with prophecy.\n\n\"Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people: and thou shalt\nmake me the head of the heathen.\"\n\nAnd the reply:\n\n\"A people whom I have not known shall serve me.\"\n\nThe working-man next to Alison had no prayer-book. She thrust her own\ninto his hand, and they read from it together....\n\nWhen they came to the second hymn the woman in front of her had\nwonderfully shed her vulgarity. Her voice--a really good one--poured\nitself out:\n\n       \"See a long race thy spacious courts adorn,\n        See future sons, and daughters yet unborn,\n        In crowding ranks on every side arise,\n        Demanding life, impatient for the skies.\"\n\nOnce Alison would have been critical of the words She was beyond that,\nnow. What did it matter, if the essential Thing were present?\n\nThe sermon was a surprise. And those who had come for excitement, for\nthe sensation of hearing a denunciation of a class they envied and\ntherefore hated, and nevertheless strove to imitate, were themselves\nrebuked. Were not their standards the same? And if the standard were\nfalse, it followed inevitably that the life was false also.\n\nHodder fairly startled these out of their preconceived notions of\nChristianity. Let them shake out of their minds everything they\nhad thought it to mean, churchgoing, acceptance of creed and dogma,\ncontributive charity, withdrawal from the world, rites and ceremonies:\nit was none of these.\n\nThe motive in the world to-day was the acquisition of property; the\nmotive of Christianity was absolutely and uncompromisingly opposed\nto this. Shock their practical sense as it might, Christianity looked\nforward with steadfast faith to a time when the incentive to amass\nproperty would be done away with, since it was a source of evil and a\ncurse to mankind. If they would be Christians, let them face that. Let\nthem enter into life, into the struggles going on around them to-day\nagainst greed, corruption, slavery, poverty, vice and crime. Let them\nprotest, let them fight, even as Jesus Christ had fought and protested.\nFor as sure as they sat there the day would come when they would be\ncalled to account, would be asked the question--what had they done to\nmake the United States of America a better place to live in?\n\nThere were in the Apostolic writings and tradition misinterpretations\nof life which had done much harm. Early Christianity had kept its eyes\nfixed on another world, and had ignored this: had overlooked the fact\nthat every man and woman was put here to do a particular work. In the\nfirst epistle of Peter the advice was given, \"submit yourselves to\nevery ordinance of man for the Lord's sake.\" But Christ had preached\ndemocracy, responsibility, had foreseen a millennium, the fulfilment of\nhis Kingdom, when all men, inspired by the Spirit, would make and keep\nin spirit the ordinances of God.\n\nBefore they could do God's work and man's work they must first be\nawakened, filled with desire. Desire was power. And he prayed that\nsome of them, on this day, would receive that desire, that power which\nnothing could resist. The desire which would lead each and every one\nto the gates of the Inner World which was limitless and eternal, filled\nwith dazzling light....\n\nLet them have faith then. Not credulity in a vague God they could not\nimagine, but faith in the Spirit of the Universe, humanity, in Jesus\nChrist who had been the complete human revelation of that Spirit, who\nhad suffered and died that man might not live in ignorance of it. To\ndoubt humanity,--such was the Great Refusal, the sin against the Holy\nGhost, the repudiation of the only true God!\n\nAfter a pause, he spoke simply of his hope for St. John's. If he\nremained here his ambition was that it would be the free temple of\nhumanity, of Jesus Christ, supported not by a few, but by all,--each in\naccordance with his means. Of those who could afford nothing, nothing\nwould be required. Perhaps this did not sound practical, nor would it be\nso if the transforming inspiration failed. He could only trust and\ntry, hold up to them the vision of the Church as a community of willing\nworkers for the Kingdom...\n\n\n\nIII\n\nAfter the service was over the people lingered in the church, standing\nin the pews and aisles, as though loath to leave. The woman with the\nperfume and the elaborate hat was heard to utter a succinct remark.\n\n\"Say, Charlie, I guess he's all right. I never had it put like that.\"\n\nThe thick-necked man's reply was inaudible.\n\nEleanor Goodrich was silent and a little pale as she pressed close to\nAlison. Her imagination had been stretched, as it were, and she was\nstill held in awe by the vastness of what she had heard and seen. Vaster\neven than ever,--so it appeared now,--demanding greater sacrifices than\nshe had dreamed of. She looked back upon the old as at receding shores.\n\nAlison, with absorbed fascination, watched the people; encountered, here\nand there, recognitions from men and women with whom she had once danced\nand dined in what now seemed a previous existence. Why had they come?\nand how had they received the message? She ran into a little man, a\ndealer in artists' supplies who once had sold her paints and brushes,\nwho stared and bowed uncertainly. She surprised him by taking his hand.\n\n\"Did you like it?\" she asked, impulsively.\n\n\"It's what I've been thinking for years, Miss Parr,\" he responded,\n\"thinking and feeling. But I never knew it was Christianity. And I never\nthought--\" he stopped and looked at her, alarmed.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I believe in it, too--or try to.\"\n\nShe left him, mentally gasping.... Without, on the sidewalk, Eleanor\nGoodrich was engaged in conversation with a stockily built man, inclined\nto stoutness; he had a brown face and a clipped, bristly mustache.\nAlison paused involuntarily, and saw him start and hesitate as his\nclear, direct gaze met her own.\n\nBedloe Hubbell was one of those who had once sought to marry her. She\nrecalled him as an amiable and aimless boy; and after she had gone East\nshe had received with incredulity and then with amusement the news of\nhis venture into altruistic politics. It was his efficiency she had\ndoubted, not his sincerity. Later tidings, contemptuous and eventually\nirritable utterances of her own father, together with accounts in the\nNew York newspapers of his campaign, had convinced her in spite of\nherself that Bedloe Hubbell had actually shaken the seats of power. And\nsomehow, as she now took him in, he looked it.\n\nHis transformation was one of the signs, one of the mysteries of the\ntimes. The ridicule and abuse of the press, the opposition and enmity\nof his childhood friends, had developed the man of force she now beheld,\nand who came forward to greet her.\n\n\"Alison!\" he exclaimed. He had changed in one sense, and not in another.\nHer colour deepened as the sound of his voice brought back the lapsed\nmemories of the old intimacy. For she had been kind to him, kinder than\nto any other; and the news of his marriage--to a woman from the Pacific\ncoast--had actually induced in her certain longings and regrets. When\nthe cards had reached her, New York and the excitement of the life into\nwhich she had been weakly, if somewhat unwittingly, drawn had already\nbegun to pall.\n\n\"I'm so glad to see you,\" she told him. \"I've heard--so many things. And\nI'm very much in sympathy with what you're doing.\"\n\nThey crossed the street, and walked away from the church together. She\nhad surprised him, and made him uncomfortable.\n\n\"You've been away so long,\" he managed to say, \"perhaps you do not\nrealize--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I do,\" she interrupted. \"I am on the other side, on your side.\nI thought of writing you, when you nearly won last autumn.\"\n\n\"You see it, too?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, I've changed, too. Not so much as you,\" she added, shyly. \"I\nalways had a certain sympathy, you know, with the Robin Hoods.\"\n\nHe laughed at her designation, both pleased and taken aback by her\npraise... But he wondered if she knew the extent of his criticism of her\nfather.\n\n\"That rector is a wonderful man,\" he broke out, irrelevantly. \"I can't\nget over' him--I can't quite grasp the fact that he exists, that he has\ndared to do what he has done.\"\n\nThis brought her colour back, but she faced him bravely. \"You think he is\nwonderful, then?\"\n\n\"Don't you?\" he demanded.\n\nShe assented. \"But I am curious to know why you do. Somehow, I never\nthought of--you--\"\n\n\"As religious,\" he supplied. \"And you? If I remember rightly--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she interrupted, \"I revolted, too. But Mr. Hodder puts it so--it\nmakes one wonder.\"\n\n\"He has not only made me wonder,\" declared Bedloe Hubbell, emphatically,\n\"I never knew what religion was until I heard this man last Sunday.\"\n\n\"Last Sunday!\"\n\n\"Until then, I hadn't been inside of a church for fifteen years,--except\nto get married. My wife takes the children, occasionally, to a\nPresbyterian church near us.\"\n\n\"And why, did you go then?\" she asked.\n\n\"I am a little ashamed of my motive,\" he confessed. \"There were\nrumours--I don't pretend to know how they got about--\" he hesitated,\nonce more aware of delicate ground. \"Wallis Plimpton said something to\na man who told me. I believe I went out of sheer curiosity to hear\nwhat Hodder would have to say. And then, I had been reading, wondering\nwhether there were anything in Christianity, after all.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" she said, careless now as to what cause he might attribute her\neagerness. \"And he gave you something?\"\n\nIt was then she grasped the truth that this sudden renewed intimacy was\nthe result of the impression Hodder had left upon the minds of both.\n\n\"He gave me everything,\" Bedloe Hubbell replied. \"I am willing to\nacknowledge it freely. In his explanation of the parable of the Prodigal\nSon, he gave me the clew to our modern times. What was for me an\ninextricable puzzle has become clear as day. He has made me understand,\nat last, the force which stirred me, which goaded me until I was fairly\ncompelled to embark in the movement which the majority of our citizens\nstill continue to regard as quixotic. I did not identify that force with\nreligion, then, and when I looked back on the first crazy campaign we\nembarked upon, with the whole city laughing at me and at the obscure\nand impractical personnel we had, there were moments when it seemed\nincomprehensible folly. I had nothing to gain, and everything to lose\nby such a venture. I was lazy and easy-going, as you know. I belonged\nto the privileged class, I had sufficient money to live in comparative\nluxury all my days, I had no grudge against these men whom I had known\nall my life.\"\n\n\"But it must have had some beginning,\" said Alison.\n\n\"I was urged to run for the city council, by these very men.\" Bedloe\nHubbell smiled at the recollection. \"They accuse me now of having\nindulged once in the same practice, for which I am condemning them.\nOur company did accept rebates, and we sought favours from the city\ngovernment. I have confessed it freely on the platform. Even during my\nfirst few months in the council what may be called the old political\npractices seemed natural to me. But gradually the iniquity of it all\nbegan to dawn on me, and then I couldn't rest until I had done something\ntowards stopping it.\n\n\"At length I began to see,\" he continued, \"that education of the masses\nwas to be our only preserver, that we should have to sink or swim by\nthat. I began to see, dimly, that this was true for other movements\ngoing on to-day. Now comes Hodder with what I sincerely believe is the\nkey. He compels men like me to recognize that our movements are not\nmerely moral, but religious. Religion, as yet unidentified, is the force\nbehind these portentous stirrings of politics in our country, from sea\nto sea. He aims, not to bring the Church into politics, but to make her\nthe feeder of these movements. Men join them to-day from all motives,\nbut the religious is the only one to which they may safely be trusted.\nHe has rescued the jewel from the dust-heap of tradition, and holds it\nup, shining, before our eyes.\"\n\nAlison looked at her companion.\n\n\"That,\" she said, \"is a very beautiful phrase.\"\n\nBedloe Hubbell smiled queerly.\n\n\"I don't know why I'm telling you all this. I can't usually talk about\nit. But the sight of that congregation this morning, mixed as it was,\nand the way he managed to weld it together.\"\n\n\"Ah, you noticed that!\" she exclaimed sharply.\n\n\"Noticed it!\"\n\n\"I know. It was a question of feeling it.\"\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"Will he succeed?\" she asked presently.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Bedloe Hubbell, \"how is it possible to predict it? The forces\nagainst him are tremendous, and it is usually the pioneer who suffers.\nI agree absolutely with his definition of faith, I have it. And the work\nhe has done already can never be undone. The time is ripe, and it is\nsomething that he has men like Phil Goodrich behind him, and Mr. Waring.\nI'm going to enlist, and from now on I intend to get every man and woman\nupon whom I have any influence whatever to go to that church....\" A\nlittle later Alison, marvelling, left him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. THE CURRENT OF LIFE\n\n\nI\n\nThe year when Hodder had gone east--to Bremerton and Bar Harbor, he\nhad read in the train a magazine article which had set fire to his\nimagination. It had to do with the lives of the men, the engineers who\ndared to deal with the wild and terrible power of the western hills, who\nharnessed and conquered roaring rivers, and sent the power hundreds\nof miles over the wilderness, by flimsy wires, to turn the wheels of\nindustry and light the dark places of the cities. And, like all men who\ncame into touch with elemental mysteries, they had their moments of pure\necstasy, gaining a tingling, intenser life from the contact with dynamic\nthings; and other moments when, in their struggle for mastery, they were\nbuffeted about, scorched, and almost overwhelmed.\n\nIn these days the remembrance of that article came back to Hodder. It\nwas as though he, too, were seeking to deflect and guide a force--the\nForce of forces. He, too, was buffeted, scorched, and bruised, at\nperiods scarce given time to recover himself in the onward rush he\nhimself had started, and which he sought to control. Problems arose\nwhich demanded the quick thinking of emergency. He, too, had his moments\nof reward, the reward of the man who is in touch with reality.\n\nHe lived, from day to day, in a bewildering succession of encouragements\nand trials, all unprecedented. If he remained at St. John's, an entire\nnew organization would be necessary.... He did not as yet see it\nclearly; and in the meantime, with his vestry alienated, awaiting the\nbishop's decision, he could make no definite plans, even if he had\nhad the leisure. Wholesale desertions had occurred in the guilds and\nsocieties, the activities of which had almost ceased. Little Tomkinson,\nthe second assistant, had resigned; and McCrae, who worked harder\nthan ever before, was already marked, Hodder knew, for dismissal if he\nhimself were defeated.\n\nAnd then there was the ever present question of money. It remained to\nbe seen whether a system of voluntary offerings were practicable. For\nHodder had made some inquiries into the so-called \"free churches,\" only\nto discover that there were benefactors behind them, benefactors the\nChristianity of whose lives was often doubtful.\n\nOne morning he received in the mail the long-expected note from the\nbishop, making an appointment for the next day. Hodder, as he read it\nover again, smiled to himself... He could gather nothing of the mind of\nthe writer from the contents.\n\nThe piece of news which came to him on the same morning swept completely\nthe contemplations of the approaching interview from his mind. Sally\nGrover stopped in at the parish house on her way to business.\n\n\"Kate Marcy's gone,\" she announced, in her abrupt fashion.\n\n\"Gone!\" he exclaimed, and stared at her in dismay. \"Gone where?\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" said Miss Grover. \"I wish I knew. I reckon we'd got\ninto the habit of trusting her too much, but it seemed the only way. She\nwasn't in her room last night, but Ella Finley didn't find it out until\nthis morning, and she ran over scared to death, to tell us about it.\"\n\nInvoluntarily the rector reached for his hat.\n\n\"I've sent out word among our friends in Dalton Street,\" Sally\ncontinued. An earthquake could not have disturbed her outer,\nmatter-of-fact calmness. But Hodder was not deceived: he knew that she\nwas as profoundly grieved and discouraged as himself. \"And I've got old\nGratz, the cabinet-maker, on the job. If she's in Dalton Street, he'll\nfind her.\"\n\n\"But what--?\" Hodder began.\n\nSally threw up her hands.\n\n\"You never can tell, with that kind. But it sticks in my mind she's done\nsomething foolish.\"\n\n\"Foolish?\"\n\nSally twitched, nervously.\n\n\"Somehow I don't think it's a spree--but as I say, you can't tell. She's\nfull of impulses. You remember how she frightened us once before, when\nshe went off and stayed all night with the woman she used to know in the\nflat house, when she heard she was sick?\"\n\nHodder nodded.\n\n\"You've inquired there?\"\n\n\"That woman went to the hospital, you know. She may be with another one.\nIf she is, Gratz ought to find her... You know there was a time, Mr.\nHodder, when I didn't have much hope that we'd pull her through. But\nwe got hold of her through her feelings. She'd do anything for Mr.\nBentley--she'd do anything for you, and the way she stuck to that\nembroidery was fine. I don't say she was cured, but whenever she'd feel\none of those fits coming on she'd let us know about it, and we'd watch\nher. And I never saw one of that kind change so. Why, she must be almost\nas good looking now as she ever was.\"\n\n\"You don't think she has done anything--desperate?\" asked Hodder,\nslowly.\n\nSally comprehended.\n\n\"Well--somehow I don't. She used to say if she ever got drunk again\nshe'd never come back. But she didn't have any money--she's given Mr.\nBentley every cent of it. And we didn't have any warning. She was as\ncheerful as could be yesterday morning, Mrs. McQuillen says.\"\n\n\"It might not do any harm to notify the police,\" replied Hodder, rising.\n\"I'll go around to headquarters now.\"\n\nHe was glad of the excuse for action. He could not have sat still. And\nas he walked rapidly across Burton Street he realized with a pang how\nmuch his heart had been set on Kate Marcy's redemption. In spite of the\nfact that every moment of his time during the past fortnight had been\nabsorbed by the cares, responsibilities, and trials thrust upon him,\nhe reproached himself for not having gone oftener to Dalton Street.\nAnd yet, if Mr. Bentley and Sally Grower had been unable to foresee and\nprevent this, what could he have done?\n\nAt police headquarters he got no news. The chief received him\ndeferentially, sympathetically, took down Kate Marcy's description, went\nso far as to remark, sagely, that too much mustn't be expected of these\nwomen, and said he would notify the rector if she were found. The chief\nknew and admired Mr. Bentley, and declared he was glad to meet Mr.\nHodder... Hodder left, too preoccupied to draw any significance from the\nnature of his welcome. He went at once to Mr. Bentley's.\n\nThe old gentleman was inclined to be hopeful, to take Sally Grower's\nview of the matter.. He trusted, he said, Sally's instinct. And Hodder\ncame away less uneasy, not a little comforted by a communion which never\nfailed to fortify him, to make him marvel at the calmness of that world\nin which his friend lived, a calmness from which no vicarious sorrow was\nexcluded. And before Hodder left, Mr. Bentley had drawn from him some\naccount of the more recent complexities at the church. The very pressure\nof his hand seemed to impart courage.\n\n\"You won't stay and have dinner with me?\"\n\nThe rector regretfully declined.\n\n\"I hear the bishop has returned,\" said Mr. Bentley, smiling.\n\nHodder was surprised. He had never heard Mr. Bentley speak of the\nbishop. Of course he must know him.\n\n\"I have my talk with him to-morrow.\"\n\nMr. Bentley said nothing, but pressed his hand again....\n\nOn Tower Street, from the direction of the church, he beheld a young man\nand a young woman approaching him absorbed in conversation. Even at a\ndistance both seemed familiar, and presently he identified the lithe\nand dainty figure in the blue dress as that of the daughter of his\nvestryman, Francis Ferguson. Presently she turned her face, alight with\nanimation, from her companion, and recognized him.\n\n\"It's Mr. Hodder!\" she exclaimed, and was suddenly overtaken with a\ncrimson shyness. The young man seemed equally embarrassed as they stood\nfacing the rector.\n\n\"I'm afraid you don't remember me, Mr. Hodder,\" he said. \"I met you at\nMr. Ferguson's last spring.\"\n\nThen it came to him. This was the young man who had made the faux pas\nwhich had caused Mrs. Ferguson so much consternation, and who had so\nmanfully apologized afterwards. His puzzled expression relaxed into a\nsmile, and he took the young man's hand.\n\n\"I was going to write to you,\" said Nan, as she looked up at the rector\nfrom under the wide brim of her hat. \"Our engagement is to be announced\nWednesday.\"\n\nHodder congratulated them. There was a brief silence, when Nan said\ntremulously:\n\n\"We're coming to St. John's!\"\n\n\"I'm very glad,\" Hodder replied, gravely. It was one of those\ncompensating moments, for him, when his tribulations vanished; and the\ntributes of the younger generation were those to which his heart most\nfreely responded. But the situation, in view of the attitude of Francis\nFerguson, was too delicate to be dwelt upon.\n\n\"I came to hear you last Sunday, Mr. Hodder,\" the young man volunteered,\nwith that mixture of awkwardness and straightforwardness which often\ncharacterize his sex and age in referring to such matters. \"And I had\nan idea of writing you, too, to tell you how much I liked what you said.\nBut I know you must have had many letters. You've made me think.\"\n\nHe flushed, but met the rector's eye. Nan stood regarding him with\npride.\n\n\"You've made me think, too,\" she added. \"And we intend to pitch in and\nhelp you, if we can be of any use.\"\n\nHe parted from them, wondering. And it was not until he had reached the\nparish house that it occurred to him that he was as yet unenlightened as\nto the young man's name....\n\nHis second reflection brought back to his mind Kate Mercy, for it was\nwith a portion of Nan Ferguson's generous check that her board had been\npaid. And he recalled the girl's hope, as she had given it to him, that\nhe would find some one in Dalton Street to help....\n\n\n\nII\n\nThere might, to the mundane eye, have been an element of the ridiculous\nin the spectacle of the rector of St. John's counting his gains, since\nhe had chosen--with every indication of insanity--to bring the pillars\nof his career crashing down on his own head. By no means the least,\nhowever, of the treasures flung into his lap was the tie which now bound\nhim to the Philip Goodriches, which otherwise would never have been\npossible. And as he made his way thither on this particular evening, a\nrenewed sense came upon him of his emancipation from the dreary, useless\nhours he had been wont to spend at other dinner tables. That existence\nappeared to him now as the glittering, feverish unreality of a nightmare\nfilled with restless women and tired men who drank champagne, thus\ngradually achieving--by the time cigars were reached--an artificial\nvivacity. The caprice and superficiality of the one sex, the inability\nto dwell upon or even penetrate a serious subject, the blindness to what\nwas going on around them; the materialism, the money standard of both,\nwere nauseating in the retrospect.\n\nHow, indeed, had life once appeared so distorted to him, a professed\nservant of humanity, as to lead him in the name of duty into that\ngalley?\n\nSuch was the burden of his thought when the homelike front of the\nGoodrich house greeted him in the darkness, its enshrouded windows\ngleaming with friendly light. As the door opened, the merry sound of\nchildren's laughter floated down the stairs, and it seemed to Hodder\nas though a curse had been lifted.... The lintel of this house had\nbeen marked for salvation, the scourge had passed it by: the scourge of\nsocial striving which lay like a blight on a free people.\n\nWithin, the note of gentility, of that instinctive good taste to which\nmany greater mansions aspired in vain, was sustained. The furniture,\nthe pictures, the walls and carpets were true expressions of the\nindividuality of master and mistress, of the unity of the life lived\ntogether; and the rector smiled as he detected, in a corner of the hall,\na sturdy but diminutive hobby-horse--here the final, harmonious touch.\nThere was the sound of a scuffle, treble shrieks of ecstasy from above,\nand Eleanor Goodrich came out to welcome him.\n\n\"Its Phil,\" she told him in laughing despair, \"he upsets all my\ndiscipline, and gets them so excited they don't go to sleep for\nhours...\"\n\nSeated in front of the fire in the drawing-room, he found Alison Parr.\nHer coolness, her radiancy, her complete acceptance of the situation,\nall this and more he felt from the moment he touched her hand and looked\ninto her face. And never had she so distinctly represented to him the\nmysterious essence of fate. Why she should have made the fourth at this\nintimate gathering, and whether or not she was or had been an especial\nfriend of Eleanor Goodrich he did not know. There was no explanation....\n\nA bowl of superb chrysanthemums occupied the centre of the table.\nEleanor lifted them off and placed them on the sideboard.\n\n\"I've got used to looking at Phil,\" she explained, \"and craning is so\npainful.\"\n\nThe effect at first was to increase the intensity of the intimacy. There\nwas no reason--he told himself--why Alison's self-possession should have\nbeen disturbed; and as he glanced at her from time to time he perceived\nthat it was not. So completely was she mistress of herself that\npresently he felt a certain faint resentment rising within him,--yet\nhe asked himself why she should not have been. It was curious that his\nimagination would not rise, now, to a realization of that intercourse\non which, at times, his fancy had dwelt with such vividness. The very\ninterest, the eagerness with which she took part in their discussions\nseemed to him in the nature of an emphatic repudiation of any ties to\nhim which might have been binding.\n\nAll this was only, on Hodder's part, to be aware of the startling\ndiscovery as to how strong his sense of possession had been, and how\nirrational, how unwarranted.\n\nFor he had believed himself, as regarding her, to have made the supreme\nrenunciation of his life. And the very fact that he had not consulted,\ncould not consult her feelings and her attitude made that renunciation\nno less difficult. All effort, all attempt at achievement of the only\nwoman for whom he had ever felt the sublime harmony of desire--the\nharmony of the mind and the flesh--was cut off.\n\nTo be here, facing her again in such close proximity, was at once a\npleasure and a torture. And gradually he found himself yielding to the\npleasure, to the illusion of permanency created by her presence.\nAnd, when all was said, he had as much to be grateful for as he could\nreasonably have wished; yes, and more. The bond (there was a bond, after\nall!) which united them was unbreakable. They had forged it together.\nThe future would take care of itself.\n\nThe range of the conversation upon which they at length embarked was\na tacit acknowledgment of a relationship which now united four persons\nwho, six months before, would have believed themselves to have had\nnothing in common. And it was characteristic of the new interest that\nit transcended the limits of the parish of St. John's, touched upon the\ngreater affairs to which that parish--if their protest prevailed--would\nnow be dedicated. Not that the church was at once mentioned, but\nsubtly implied as now enlisted,--and emancipated henceforth from all\necclesiastical narrowness.... The amazing thing by which Hodder was\nsuddenly struck was the naturalness with which Alison seemed to fit into\nthe new scheme. It was as though she intended to remain there, and had\nabandoned all intention of returning to the life which apparently she\nhad once permanently and definitely chosen....\n\nBedloe Hubbell's campaign was another topic. And Phil had observed,\nwith the earnestness which marked his more serious statements, that it\nwouldn't surprise him if young Carter, Hubbell's candidate for mayor,\noverturned that autumn the Beatty machine.\n\n\"Oh, do you think so!\" Alison exclaimed with exhilaration.\n\n\"They're frightened and out of breath,\" said Phil, \"they had no idea\nthat Bedloe would stick after they had licked him in three campaigns.\nTwo years ago they tried to buy him off by offering to send him to the\nSenate, and Wallis Plimpton has never got through his head to this why\nhe refused.\"\n\nPlimpton's head, Eleanor declared dryly, was impervious to a certain\nkind of idea.\n\n\"I wonder if you know, Mr. Hodder, what an admirer Mr. Hubbell is of\nyours?\" Alison asked. \"He is most anxious to have a talk with you.\"\n\nHodder did not know.\n\n\"Well,\" said Phil, enthusiastically, to the rector, \"that's the best\ntribute you've had yet. I can't say that Bedloe was a more unregenerate\nheathen than I was, but he was pretty bad.\"\n\nThis led them, all save Hodder, into comments on the character of the\ncongregation the Sunday before, in the midst of which the rector was\ncalled away to the telephone. Sally Grover had promised to let him know\nwhether or not they had found Kate Marcy, and his face was grave when he\nreturned.... He was still preoccupied, an hour later, when Alison arose\nto go.\n\n\"But your carriage isn't here,\" said Phil, going to the window.\n\n\"Oh, I preferred to, walk,\" she told him, \"it isn't far.\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\nA blood-red October moon shed the fulness of its light on the silent\nhouses, and the trees, still clinging to leaf, cast black shadows across\nthe lawns and deserted streets. The very echoes of their footsteps on\nthe pavement seemed to enhance the unreality of their surroundings: Some\nof the residences were already closed for the night, although the hour\nwas not late, and the glow behind the blinds of the others was nullified\nby the radiancy from above. To Hodder, the sense of their isolation had\nnever been more complete.\n\nAlison, while repudiating the notion that an escort were needed in a\nneighbourhood of such propriety and peace, had not refused his offer\nto accompany her. And Hodder felt instinctively, as he took his place\nbeside her, a sense of climax. This situation, like those of the past,\nwas not of his own making. It was here; confronting him, and a certain\ninevitable intoxication at being once, more alone with her prevented\nhim from forming any policy with which to deal with it. He might either\ntrust himself, or else he might not. And as she said, the distance was\nnot great. But he could not help wondering, during those first moments\nof silence, whether she comprehended the strength of the temptation to\nwhich she subjected him....\n\nThe night was warm. She wore a coat, which was open, and from time to\ntime he caught the gleam of the moonlight on the knotted pearls at her\nthroat. Over her head she had flung, mantilla-like, a black lace scarf,\nthe effect of which was, in the soft luminosity encircling her, to add\nto the quality of mystery never exhausted. If by acquiescing in his\ncompany she had owned to a tie between them, the lace shawl falling\nover the tails of her dark hair and framing in its folds her face, had\nsomehow made her once more a stranger. Nor was it until she presently\nlooked up into his face with a smile that this impression was, if not at\nonce wholly dissipated, at least contradicted.\n\nHer question, indeed, was intimate.\n\n\"Why did you come with me?\"\n\n\"Why?\" he repeated, taken aback.\n\n\"Yes. I'm sure you have something you wish to do, something which\nparticularly worries you.\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered, appraising her intuition of him, \"there is nothing\nI can do, to-night. A young woman in whom Mr. Bentley is interested, in\nwhom I am interested, has disappeared. But we have taken all the steps\npossible towards finding her.\"\n\n\"It was nothing--more serious, then? That, of course, is serious enough.\nNothing, I mean, directly affecting your prospects of remaining--where\nyou are?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered. He rejoiced fiercely that she should have asked him.\nThe question was not bold, but a natural resumption of the old footing\n\"Not that I mean to imply,\" he added, returning her smile, \"that those\nprospects' are in any way improved.\"\n\n\"Are they any worse?\" she said.\n\n\"I see the bishop to-morrow. I have no idea what position he will\ntake. But even if he should decide not to recommend me for trial many\ndifficult problems still remain to be solved.\"\n\n\"I know. It's fine,\" she continued, after a moment, \"the way you are\ngoing ahead as if there were no question of your not remaining; and\ngetting all those people into the church and influencing them as you did\nwhen they had come for all sorts of reasons. Do you remember, the first\ntime I met you, I told you I could not think of you as a clergyman. I\ncannot now--less than ever.\"\n\n\"What do you think of me as?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she considered. \"You are unlike any person I have ever\nknown. It is curious that I cannot now even think of St. John's as\na church. You have transformed it into something that seems new. I'm\nafraid I can't describe what I mean, but you have opened it up, let in\nthe fresh air, rid it of the musty and deadening atmosphere which I\nhave always associated with churches. I wanted to see you, before I went\naway,\" she went on steadily, \"and when Eleanor mentioned that you were\ncoming to her house to-night, I asked her to invite me. Do you think me\nshameless?\"\n\nThe emphasis of his gesture was sufficient. He could not trust himself\nto speak.\n\n\"Writing seemed so unsatisfactory, after what you had done for me, and I\nnever can express myself in writing. I seem to congeal.\"\n\n\"After what I have done for you!\" he exclaimed: \"What can I have done?\"\n\n\"You have done more than you know,\" she answered, in a low voice. \"More,\nI think, than I know. How are such things to be measured, put into\nwords? You have effected some change in me which defies analysis, a\nchange of attitude,--to attempt to dogmatize it would ruin it. I prefer\nto leave it undefined--not even to call it an acquisition of faith. I\nhave faith,\" she said, simply, \"in what you have become, and which has\nmade you dare, superbly, to cast everything away... It is that, more\nthan anything you have said. What you are.\"\n\nFor the instant he lost control of himself.\n\n\"What you are,\" he replied. \"Do you realize--can you ever realize what\nyour faith in me has been to me?\"\n\nShe appeared to ignore this.\n\n\"I did not mean to say that you have not made many things clear, which\nonce were obscure, as I wrote you. You have convinced me that true\nbelief, for instance, is the hardest thing in the world, the denial of\npractically all these people, who profess to believe, represent. The\nmajority of them insist that humanity is not to be trusted...\"\n\nThey had reached, in an incredibly brief time, the corner of Park\nStreet.\n\n\"When are you leaving?\" he asked, in a voice that sounded harsh in his\nown ears.\n\n\"Come!\" she said gently, \"I'm not going in yet, for a while.\"\n\nThe Park lay before them, an empty, garden filled with checquered\nlight and shadows under the moon. He followed her across the gravel,\nglistening with dew, past the statue of the mute statesman with arm\nupraised, into pastoral stretches--a delectable country which was theirs\nalone. He did not take it in, save as one expression of the breathing\nwoman at his side. He was but partly conscious of a direction he had not\nchosen. His blood throbbed violently, and a feeling of actual physical\nfaintness was upon him. He was being led, helplessly, all volition gone,\nand the very idea of resistance became chimerical....\n\nThere was a seat under a tree, beside a still lake burnished by the\nmoon. It seemed as though he could not bear the current of her touch,\nand yet the thought of its removal were less bearable... For she had put\nher own hand out, not shyly, but with a movement so fraught with grace,\nso natural that it was but the crowning bestowal.\n\n\"Alison!\" he cried, \"I can't ask it of you. I have no right--\"\n\n\"You're not asking it,\" she answered. \"It is I who am asking it.\"\n\n\"But I have no future--I may be an outcast to-morrow. I have nothing to\noffer you.\" He spoke more firmly now, more commandingly.\n\n\"Don't you see, dear, that it is just because your future as obscure\nthat I can do this? You never would have done it, I know,--and I\ncouldn't face that. Don't you understand that I am demanding the great\nsacrifice?\"\n\n\"Sacrifice!\" he repeated. His fingers turned, and closed convulsively on\nhers.\n\n\"Yes, sacrifice,\" she said gently. \"Isn't it the braver thing?\"\n\nStill he failed to catch her meaning.\n\n\"Braver,\" she explained, with her wonderful courage, \"braver if I love\nyou, if I need you, if I cannot do without you.\"\n\nHe took her in his arms, crushing her to him in his strength, in one\nineffable brief moment finding her lips, inhaling the faint perfume\nof her smooth akin. Her lithe figure lay passively against him, in\nmarvellous, unbelievable surrender.\n\n\"I see what you mean,\" he said, at length, \"I should have been a coward.\nBut I could not be sure that you loved me.\"\n\nSo near was her face that he could detect, even under the obscurity of\nthe branches, a smile.\n\n\"And so I was reduced to this! I threw my pride to the winds,\" she\nwhispered. \"But I don't care. I was determined, selfishly, to take\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"And to give it,\" he added, bending down to her. The supreme quality of\nits essence was still to be doubted, a bright star-dust which dazzled\nhim, to evaporate before his waking eyes. And, try as he would, he could\nnot realize to the full depth the boy of contact with a being whom, by\ndiscipline, he had trained his mind to look upon as the unattainable.\nThey had spoken of the future, yet in these moments any consideration of\nit was blotted out... It was only by degrees that he collected himself\nsufficiently to be able to return to it... Alison took up the thread.\n\n\"Surely,\" she said, \"sacrifice is useless unless it means something,\nunless it be a realization. It must be discriminating. And we should\nboth of us have remained incomplete if we had not taken--this. You would\nalways, I think, have been the one man for me,--but we should have lost\ntouch.\" He felt her tremble. \"And I needed you. I have needed you all\nmy life--one in whom h might have absolute faith. That is my faith, of\nwhich I could not tell you awhile ago. Is it--sacrilegious?\"\n\nShe looked up at him. He shook his head, thinking of his own. It seemed\nthe very distillation of the divine. \"All my life,\" she went on, \"I\nhave been waiting for the one who would risk everything. Oh, if you had\nfaltered the least little bit, I don't know what I should have done.\nThat would have destroyed what was left of me, put out, I think, the\nflickering fire that remained, instead of fanning it into flame. You\ncannot know how I watched you, how I prayed! I think it was prayer--I am\nsure it was. And it was because you did not falter, because you risked\nall, that you gained me. You have gained only what you yourself made,\nmore than I ever was, more than I ever expected to be.\"\n\n\"Alison!\" he remonstrated, \"you mustn't say that.\"\n\nShe straightened up and gazed at him, taking one of his hands in her\nlithe fingers.\n\n\"Oh, but I must! It is the truth. I felt that you cared--women are surer\nin such matters than men. I must conceal nothing from you--nothing of my\ncraftiness. Women are crafty, you know. And suppose you fail? Ah, I do\nnot mean failure--you cannot fail, now. You have put yourself forever\nbeyond failure. But what I mean is, suppose you were compelled to leave\nSt. John's, and I came to you then as I have come now, and begged to\ntake my place beside you? I was afraid to risk it. I was afraid you\nwould not take me, even now, to-night. Do you realize how austere you\nare at times, how you have frightened me?\"\n\n\"That I should ever have done that!\" he said.\n\n\"When I looked at you in the pulpit you seemed so far from me, I could\nscarcely bear it. As if I had no share in you, as if you had already\ngone to a place beyond, where I could not go, where I never could. Oh,\nyou will take me with you, now,--you won't leave me behind!\"\n\nTo this cry every fibre of his soul responded. He had thought himself,\nin these minutes, to have known all feelings, all thrills, but now, as\nhe gathered her to him again, he was to know still another, the most\nexquisite of all. That it was conferred upon him to give this woman\nprotection, to shield and lift her, inspire her as she inspired\nhim--this consciousness was the most exquisite of all, transcending all\nconception of the love of woman. And the very fulness of her was beyond\nhim. A lifetime were insufficient to exhaust her....\n\n\"I wanted to come to you now, John. I want to share your failure, if it\ncomes--all your failures. Because they will be victories--don't you see?\nI have never been able to achieve that kind of victory--real victory, by\nmyself. I have always succumbed, taken the baser, the easier thing.\" Her\ncheek was wet. \"I wasn't strong enough, by myself, and I never knew the\nstronger one....\n\n\"See what my trust in you has been! I knew that you would not refuse me\nin spite of the fact that the world may misunderstand, may sneer at\nyour taking me. I knew that you were big enough even for that, when you\nunderstood it, coming from me. I wanted to be with you, now, that we\nmight fight it out together.\"\n\n\"What have I done to deserve so priceless a thing?\" he asked.\n\nShe smiled at him again, her lip trembling.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not priceless, I'm only real, I'm only human--human and tired.\nYou are so strong, you can't know how tired. Have you any idea why I\ncame out here, this summer? It was because I was desperate--because I\nhad almost decided to marry some one else.\"\n\nShe felt him start.\n\n\"I was afraid of it;\" he said.\n\n\"Were you? Did you think, did you wonder a little about me?\" There was\na vibrant note of triumph to which he reacted. She drew away from him.\na little. \"Perhaps, when you know how sordid my life has been, you won't\nwant me.\"\n\n\"Is--Is that your faith, Alison?\" he demanded. \"God forbid! You have\ncome to a man who also has confessions to make.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am glad. I want to know all of you--all, do you understand? That\nwill bring us even closer together. And it was one thing I felt about\nyou in the beginning, that day in the garden, that you had had much to\nconquer--more than most men. It was a part of your force and of your\nknowledge of life. You were not a sexless ascetic who preached a mere\nneutral goodness. Does that shock you?\"\n\nHe smiled in turn.\n\n\"I went away from here, as I once told you, full of a high resolution\nnot to trail the honour of my art--if I achieved art--in the dust. But\nI have not only trailed my art--I trailed myself. In New York I became\ncontaminated,--the poison of the place, of the people with whom I came\nin contact, got into my blood. Little by little I yielded--I wanted so\nto succeed, to be able to confound those who had doubted and ridiculed\nme! I wasn't content to wait to deny myself for the ideal. Success was\nin the air. That was the poison, and I only began to realize it after it\nwas too late.\n\n\"Please don't think I am asking pity--I feel that you must know. From\nthe very first my success--which was really failure--began to come in\nthe wrong way. As my father's daughter I could not be obscure. I was\nsought out, I was what was called picturesque, I suppose. The women\npetted me, although some of them hated me, and I had a fascination for\na certain kind of men--the wrong kind. I began going to dinners, house\nparties, to recognize, that advantages came that way.... It seemed quite\nnatural. It was what many others of my profession tried to do, and they\nenvied me my opportunities.\n\n\"I ought to say, in justice to myself, that I was not in the least\ncynical about it. I believed I was clinging to the ideal of art, and\nthat all I wanted was a chance. And the people I went with had the same\ncharacteristics, only intensified, as those I had known here. Of course\nI was actually no better than the women who were striving frivolously\nto get away from themselves, and the men who were fighting to get money.\nOnly I didn't know it.\n\n\"Well, my chance came at last. I had done several little things, when an\nelderly man who is tremendously rich, whose name you would recognize if\nI mentioned it, gave me an order. For weeks, nearly every day, he\ncame to my studio for tea, to talk over the plans. I was really\nunsophisticated then--but I can see now--well, that the garden was a\nsecondary consideration.... And the fact that I did it for him gave me a\nstanding I should not otherwise have had.... Oh, it is sickening to look\nback upon, to think what an idiot I was in how little I saw....\n\n\"That garden launched me, and I began to have more work than I could do.\nI was conscientious about it tried--tried to make every garden better\nthan the last. But I was a young woman, unconventionally living alone,\nand by degrees the handicap of my sex was brought home to me. I did not\nfeel the pressure at first, and then--I am ashamed to say--it had in it\nan element of excitement, a sense of power. The poison was at work.\nI was amused. I thought I could carry it through, that the world had\nadvanced sufficiently for a woman to do anything if she only had the\ncourage. And I believed I possessed a true broadness of view, and could\nimpress it, so far as I was concerned, on others....\n\n\"As I look back upon it all, I believe my reputation for coldness saved\nme, yet it was that very reputation which increased the pressure, and\nsometimes I was fairly driven into a corner. It seemed to madden\nsome men--and the disillusionments began to come. Of course it was\nmy fault--I don't pretend to say it wasn't. There were many whom,\ninstinctively, I was on my guard against, but some I thought really\nnice, whom I trusted, revealed a side I had not suspected. That was the\nterrible thing! And yet I held to my ideal, tattered as it was...\"\n\nAlison was silent a moment, still clinging to his hand, and when she\nspoke again it was with a tremor of agitation.\n\n\"It is hard, to tell you this, but I wish you to know. At last I met\na man, comparatively young, who was making his own way in New York,\nachieving a reputation as a lawyer. Shall I tell you that I fell in love\nwith him? He seemed to bring a new freshness into my life when I was\nbeginning to feel the staleness of it. Not that I surrendered at once,\nbut the reservations of which I was conscious at the first gradually\ndisappeared--or rather I ignored them. He had charm, a magnificent\nself-confidence, but I think the liberality of the opinions he\nexpressed, in regard to women, most appealed to me. I was weak on that\nside, and I have often wondered whether he knew it. I believed him\nincapable of a great refusal.\n\n\"He agreed, if I consented to marry him, that I should have my\nfreedom--freedom to live in my own life and to carry on my profession.\nFortunately, the engagement was never announced, never even suspected.\nOne day he hinted that I should return to my father for a month or two\nbefore the wedding.... The manner in which he said it suddenly turned me\ncold. Oh,\" Alison exclaimed, \"I was quite willing to go back, to pay\nmy father a visit, as I had done nearly every year, but--how can I tell\nyou?--he could not believe that I had definitely given up-my father's\nmoney....\n\n\"I sat still and looked at him, I felt as if I were frozen, turned to\nstone. And after a long while, since I would not speak to him, he went\nout... Three months later he came back and said that I had misunderstood\nhim, that he couldn't live without me. I sent him away.... Only the\nother day he married Amy Grant, one of my friends....\n\n\"Well, after that, I was tired--so tired! Everything seemed to go out of\nlife. It wasn't that I loved him any longer,--all had been crushed. But\nthe illusion was gone, and I saw myself as I was. And for the first time\nin my life I felt defenceless, helpless. I wanted refuge. Did you ever\nhear of Jennings Howe?\"\n\n\"The architect?\"\n\nAlison nodded. \"Of course you must have--he is so well known. He has\nbeen a widower for several years. He liked my work, saw its defects,\nand was always frank about them, and I designed a good many gardens in\nconnection with his houses. He himself is above all things an artist,\nand he fell into the habit of coming to my studio and giving me friendly\nadvice, in the nicest way. He seemed to understand that I was going\nthrough some sort of a crisis. He called it 'too much society.' And\nthen, without any warning, he asked me to marry him.\n\n\"That is why I came out here--to think it over. I didn't love him, and I\ntold him so, but I respected him.\n\n\"He never compromised in his art, and I have known him over and over to\nrefuse houses because certain conditions were stipulated. To marry him\nwas an acknowledgment of defeat. I realized that. But I had come to the\nextremity where I wanted peace--peace and protection. I wanted to put\nmyself irrevocably beyond the old life, which simply could not have gone\non, and I saw myself in the advancing years becoming tawdry and worn,\nlosing little by little what I had gained at a price.\n\n\"So I came here--to reflect, to see, as it were, if I could find\nsomething left in me to take hold of, to build upon, to begin over\nagain, perhaps, by going back to the old associations. I could think of\nno better place, and I knew that my father would, be going away after\na few weeks, and that I should be lone, yet with an atmosphere back of\nme,--my old atmosphere. That was why I went to church the first Sunday,\nin order to feel more definitely that atmosphere, to summon up more\ncompletely the image of my mother. More and more, as the years have\npassed, I have thought of her in moments of trouble. I have recovered\nher as I never had hoped to do in Mr. Bentley. Isn't it strange,\" she\nexclaimed wonderingly, \"that he should have come into both our lives,\nwith such an influence, at this time?\"\n\n\"And then I met you, talked to you that afternoon in the garden. Shall I\nmake a complete confession? I wrote to Jennings Howe that very week that\nI could not marry him.\"\n\n\"You knew!\" Hodder exclaimed: \"You knew then?\"\n\n\"Ah, I can't tell what I knew--or when. I knew, after I had seen you,\nthat I couldn't marry him! Isn't that enough?\"\n\nHe drew in his breath deeply.\n\n\"I should be less than a man if I refused to take you, Alison. And--no\nmatter what happens, I can and will find some honest work to support\nyou. But oh, my dear, when I think of it, the nobility and generosity of\nwhat you have done appalls me.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" she protested, \"you mustn't say that! I needed you more than\nyou need me. And haven't we both discovered the world, and renounced it?\nI can at least go so far as to say that, with all my heart. And isn't\nmarriage truer and higher when man and wife start with difficulties\nand problems to solve together? It is that thought that brings me the\ngreatest joy, that I may be able to help you.... Didn't you need me,\njust a little?\"\n\n\"Now that I have you, I am unable to think of the emptiness which might\nhave been. You came to me, like Beatrice, when I had lost my way in the\ndarkness of the wood. And like Beatrice, you showed me the path, and\nhell and heaven.\"\n\n\"Oh, you would have found the path without me. I cannot claim that.\nI saw from the first that you were destined to find it. And, unlike\nBeatrice, I too was lost, and it was you who lifted me up. You mustn't\nidealize me.\"... She stood up. \"Come!\" she said. He too stood, gazing at\nher, and she lifted her hands to his shoulders.... They moved out from\nunder the tree and walked for a while in silence across the dew-drenched\ngrass, towards Park Street. The moon, which had ridden over a great\nspace in the sky, hung red above the blackness of the forest to the\nwest.\n\n\"Do you remember when we were here together, the day I met Mr. Bentley?\nAnd you never would have spoken!\"\n\n\"How could I, Alison?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, you couldn't. And yet--you would have let me go!\"\n\nHe put his arm in hers, and drew her towards him.\n\n\"I must talk to your father,\" he said, \"some day--soon. I ought to tell\nhim--of our intentions. We cannot go on like this.\"\n\n\"No,\" she agreed, \"I realize it. And I cannot stay, much longer, in Park\nStreet. I must go back to New York, until you send for me, dear. And\nthere are things I must do. Do you know, even though I antagonize him\nso--my father, I mean--even though he suspects and bitterly resents any\ninterest in you, my affection for you, and that I have lingered because\nof you, I believe, in his way, he has liked to have me here.\"\n\n\"I can understand it,\" Hodder said.\n\n\"It's because you are bigger than I, although he has quarrelled with\nyou so bitterly. I don't know what definite wrongs he has done to other\npersons. I don't wish to know. I don't ask you to tell me what passed\nbetween you that night. Once you said that you had an affection for\nhim--that he was lonely. He is lonely. In these last weeks, in spite of\nhis anger, I can see that he suffers terribly. It is a tragedy, because\nhe will never give in.\"\n\n\"It is a tragedy.\" Hodder's tone was agitated.\n\n\"I wonder if he realizes a little\" she began, and paused. \"Now that\nPreston has come home--\"\n\n\"Your brother?\" Hodder exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes. I forgot to tell you. I don't know why he came,\" she faltered.\n\"I suppose he has got into some new trouble. He seems changed. I can't\ndescribe it now, but I will tell you about it.... It's the first time\nwe've all three been together since my mother died, for Preston wasn't\nback from college when I went to Paris to study....\"\n\nThey stood together on the pavement before the massive house, fraught\nwith so many and varied associations for Hodder. And as he looked up\nat it, his eye involuntarily rested upon the windows of the boy's\nroom where Eldon Parr had made his confession. Alison startled him by\npronouncing his name, which came with such unaccustomed sweetness from\nher lips. \"You will write me to-morrow,\" she said, \"after you have seen\nthe bishop?\"\n\n\"Yes, at once. You mustn't let it worry you.\"\n\n\"I feel as if I had cast off that kind of worry forever. It is only--the\nother worries from which we do not escape, from which we do not wish to\nescape.\"\n\nWith a wonderful smile she had dropped his hands and gone in at the\nentrance, when a sound made them turn, the humming of a motor. And even\nas they looked it swung into Park Street.\n\n\"It's a taxicab!\" she said. As she spoke it drew up almost beside\nthem, instead of turning in at the driveway, the door opened, and a man\nalighted.\n\n\"Preston!\" Alison exclaimed.\n\nHe started, turning from the driver, whom he was about to pay. As for\nHodder, he was not only undergoing a certain shock through the\nsudden contact, at such a moment, with Alison's brother: there was an\nadditional shock that this was Alison's brother and Eldon Parr's son.\nNot that his appearance was shocking, although the well-clad, athletic\nfigure was growing a trifle heavy, and the light from the side lamps of\nthe car revealed dissipation in a still handsome face. The effect was\na subtler one, not to be analyzed, and due to a multitude of\npreconceptions.\n\nAlison came forward.\n\n\"This is Mr. Hodder, Preston,\" she said simply.\n\nFor a moment Preston continued to stare at the rector without speaking.\nSuddenly he put out his hand.\n\n\"Mr. Hodder, of St. John's?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Hodder. His surprise deepened to perplexity at the\nwarmth of the handclasp that followed.\n\nA smile that brought back vividly to Hodder the sunny expression of the\nschoolboy in the picture lightened the features of the man.\n\n\"I'm very glad to see you,\" he said, in a tone that left no doubt of its\ngenuine quality.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Hodder replied, meeting his eye with kindness, yet with\na scrutiny that sought to penetrate the secret of an unexpected\ncordiality. \"I, too, have hoped to see you.\"\n\nAlison, who stood by wondering, felt a meaning behind the rector's\nwords. She pressed his hand as he bade her, once more, good night.\n\n\"Won't you take my taxicab?\" asked Preston. \"It is going down town\nanyway.\"\n\n\"I think I'd better stick to the street cars,\" Hodder said. His refusal\nwas not ungraceful, but firm. Preston did not insist.\n\nIn spite of the events of that evening, which he went over again and\nagain as the midnight car carried him eastward, in spite of a new-born\nhappiness the actuality of which was still difficult to grasp, Hodder\nwas vaguely troubled when he thought of Preston Parr.\n\n\n\n\nVolume 8.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. RETRIBUTION\n\n\nI\n\nThe Bishop's House was a comfortable, double dwelling of a smooth,\nbright red brick and large, plate-glass windows, situated in a plot at\nthe western end of Waverley Place. It had been bought by the Diocese\nin the nineties, and was representative of that transitional period in\nAmerican architecture when the mansard roof had been repudiated, when\nas yet no definite types had emerged to take its place. The house had\npointed gables, and a tiny and utterly useless porch that served only\nto darken the front door, made of heavy pieces of wood fantastically\ncurved.\n\nIt was precisely ten o'clock in the morning when Hodder rang the bell\nand was shown into the ample study which he had entered on other\nand less vital occasions. He found difficulty in realizing that this\npleasant room, lined with well-worn books and overlooking a back lawn\nwhere the clothes of the episcopal family hung in the yellow autumn sun,\nwas to be his judgment seat, whence he might be committed to trial for\nheresy.\n\nAnd this was the twentieth century! The full force of the preposterous\nfact smote him, and a consciousness of the distance he himself had\ntravelled since the comparatively recent days of his own orthodoxy. And\nsuddenly he was full again of a resentful impatience, not only that he\nshould be called away from his labours, his cares, the strangers who\nwere craving his help, to answer charges of such an absurd triviality,\nbut that the performance of the great task to which he had set his hand,\nwith God's help, should depend upon it. Would his enemies be permitted\nto drive him out thus easily?\n\nThe old bishop came in, walking by the aid of a cane. He smiled at\nHodder, who greeted him respectfully, and bidding him sit down, took\na chair himself behind his writing table, from whence he gazed awhile\nearnestly and contemplatively at the rugged features and strong\nshoulders of the rector of St. John's. The effect of the look was that\nof a visual effort to harmonize the man with the deed he had done,\nthe stir he had created in the city and the diocese; to readjust\nimpressions.\n\nA hint of humour crept into the bishop's blue eyes, which were watery,\nyet strong, with heavy creases in the corners. He indicated by a little\ngesture three bundles of envelopes, bound by rubber bands, on the corner\nof his blotter.\n\n\"Hodder,\" he said, \"see what a lot of trouble you have made for me in my\nold age! All those are about you.\"\n\nThe rector's expression could not have been deemed stern, but it had met\nthe bishop's look unflinchingly. Now it relaxed into a responding smile,\nwhich was not without seriousness.\n\n\"I am sorry, sir,\" Hodder answered, \"to have caused you any worry--or\ninconvenience.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said the bishop, \"I have had too much smooth sailing for a\nservant of Christ. Indeed, I have come to that conclusion.\"\n\nHodder did not reply. He was moved, even more by the bishop's manner\nand voice than his words. And the opening to their conversation was\nunexpected. The old man put on his spectacles, and drew from the top of\none of the bundles a letter.\n\n\"This is from one of your vestrymen, Mr. Gordon Atterbury,\" he said, and\nproceeded to read it, slowly. When he had finished he laid it down.\n\n\"Is that, according to your recollection, Mr. Hodder, a fairly accurate\nsummary of the sermon you gave when you resumed the pulpit at the end of\nthe summer?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the rector, \"it is surprisingly accurate, with the\nexception of two or three inferences which I shall explain at the proper\nmoment.\"\n\n\"Mr. Atterbury is to be congratulated on his memory,\" the bishop\nobserved a little dryly. \"And he has saved me the trouble of reading\nmore. Now what are the inferences to which you object?\"\n\nHodder stated them. \"The most serious one,\" he added, \"is that which he\ndraws from my attitude on the virgin birth. Mr. Atterbury insists, like\nothers who cling to that dogma, that I have become what he vaguely calls\nan Unitarian. He seems incapable of grasping my meaning, that the only\ntrue God the age knows, the world has ever known, is the God in Christ,\nis the Spirit in Christ, and is there not by any material proof, but\nbecause we recognize it spiritually. And that doctrine and dogma,\nancient speculations as to how, definitely, that spirit came to be in\nChrist, are fruitless and mischievous to-day. Mr. Atterbury and others\nseem actually to resent my identification of our Lord's Spirit with the\nsocial conscience as well as the individual conscience of our time.\"\n\nThe bishop nodded.\n\n\"Hodder,\" he demanded abruptly, leaning forward over his desk, \"how did\nthis thing happen?\"\n\n\"You mean, sir--\"\n\nThere was, in the bishop's voice, a note almost pathetic. \"Oh, I do not\nmean to ask you anything you may deem too personal. And God forbid, as I\nlook at you, as I have known you, that I should doubt your sincerity. I\nam not your inquisitor, but your bishop and your friend, and I am asking\nfor your confidence. Six months ago you were, apparently, one of the\nmost orthodox rectors in the diocese. I recognize that you are not an\nimpulsive, sensational man, and I am all the more anxious to learn from\nyour own lips something of the influences, of the processes which have\nchanged you, which have been strong enough to impel you to risk the\nposition you have achieved.\"\n\nBy this unlooked-for appeal Hodder was not only disarmed, but smitten\nwith self-reproach at the thought of his former misjudgment and\nunderestimation of the man in whose presence he sat. And it came over\nhim, not only the extent to which, formerly, he had regarded the bishop\nas too tolerant and easygoing, but the fact that he had arrived here\ntoday prepared to find in his superior anything but the attitude he was\nshowing. Considering the bishop's age, Hodder had been ready for a lack\nof understanding of the step he had taken, even for querulous reproaches\nand rebuke.\n\nHe had, therefore, to pull himself together, to adjust himself to the\nunexpected greatness of soul with which he was being received before he\nbegan to sketch the misgivings he had felt from the early days of his\nrectorship of St. John's; the helplessness and failure which by degrees\nhad come over him. He related how it had become apparent to him that\nby far the greater part of his rich and fashionable congregation\nwere Christians only in name, who kept their religion in a small and\nimpervious compartment where it did not interfere with their lives. He\npictured the yearning and perplexity of those who had come to him for\nhelp, who could not accept the old explanations, and had gone away\nempty; and he had not been able to make Christians of the poor who\nattended the parish house. Finally, trusting in the bishop's discretion,\nhe spoke of the revelations he had unearthed in Dalton Street, and how\nthese had completely destroyed his confidence in the Christianity he had\npreached, and how he had put his old faith to the test of unprejudiced\nmodern criticism, philosophy, and science...\n\nThe bishop listened intently, his head bent, his eyes on he rector.\n\n\"And you have come out--convinced?\" he asked tremulously. \"Yes, yes, I\nsee you have. It is enough.\"\n\nHe relapsed into thought, his wrinkled hand lying idly on the table.\n\n\"I need not tell you, my friend,\" he resumed at length, \"that a great\ndeal of pressure has been brought to bear upon me in this matter, more\nthan I have ever before experienced. You have mortally offended, among\nothers, the most powerful layman in the diocese, Mr. Parr, who complains\nthat you have presumed to take him to task concerning his private\naffairs.\"\n\n\"I told him,\" answered Holder, \"that so long as he continued to live the\nlife he leads, I could not accept his contributions to St. John's.\"\n\n\"I am an old man,\" said the bishop, \"and whatever usefulness I have had\nis almost finished. But if I were young to-day, I should pray God for\nthe courage and insight you have shown, and I am thankful to have lived\nlong enough to have known you. It has, at least, been given one to\nrealize that times have changed, that we are on the verge of a mighty\nfuture. I will be frank to say that ten years ago, if this had happened,\nI should have recommended you for trial. Now I can only wish you\nGodspeed. I, too, can see the light, my friend. I can see, I think,\nthough dimly, the beginnings of a blending of all sects, of all\nreligions in the increasing vision of the truth revealed in Jesus\nChrist, stripped, as you say, of dogma, of fruitless attempts at\nrational explanation. In Japan and China, in India and Persia, as well\nas in Christian countries, it is coming, coming by some working of the\nSpirit the mystery of which is beyond us. And nations and men who even\nyet know nothing of the Gospels are showing a willingness to adopt what\nis Christ's, and the God of Christ.\"\n\nHolder was silent, from sheer inability to speak.\n\n\"If you had needed an advocate with me,\" the bishop continued, \"you\ncould not have had one to whose counsel I would more willingly have\nlistened, than that of Horace Bentley. He wrote asking to come and see\nme, but I went to him in Dalton Street the day I returned. And it gives\nme satisfaction, Mr. Holder, to confess to you freely that he has taught\nme, by his life, more of true Christianity than I have learned in all my\nexperience elsewhere.\"\n\n\"I had thought,\" exclaimed the rector, wonderingly, \"that I owed him\nmore than any other man.\"\n\n\"There are many who think that--hundreds, I should say,\" the bishop\nreplied.... \"Eldon Parr ruined him, drove him from the church.... It\nis strange how, outside of the church, his influence has silently and\ncontinuously grown until it has borne fruit in--this. Even now,\" he\nadded after a pause, \"the cautiousness, the dread of change which comes\nwith old age might, I think, lead me to be afraid of it if I--didn't\nperceive behind it the spirit of Horace Bentley.\"\n\nIt struck Holder, suddenly, what an unconscious but real source of\nconfidence this thought had likewise been to him. He spoke of it.\n\n\"It is not that I wouldn't trust you,\" the bishop went on. \"I have\nwatched you, I have talked to Asa Waring, I have read the newspapers. In\nspite of it all, you have kept your head, you have not compromised the\ndignity of the Church. But oh, my friend, I beg you to bear in mind\nthat you are launched upon deep waters, that you have raised up many\nenemies--enemies of Christ--who seek to destroy you. You are still\nyoung. And the uncompromising experiment to which you are pledged,\nof freeing your church, of placing her in the position of power and\ninfluence in the community which is rightfully hers, is as yet untried.\nAnd no stone will be left unturned to discourage and overcome you. You\nhave faith,--you have made me feel it as you sat here,--a faith which\nwill save you from bitterness in personal defeat. You may not reap the\nvictory, or even see it in your lifetime. But of this I am sure, that\nyou will be able to say, with Paul, 'I have planted, Apollos watered,\nbut God gave the increase.' Whatever happens, you may count upon my\nconfidence and support. I can only wish that I were younger, that my arm\nwere stronger, and that I had always perceived the truth as clearly as I\nsee it now.\"\n\nHolder had risen involuntarily while these words were being spoken. They\nwere indeed a benediction, and the intensity of his feeling warned him\nof the inadequacy of any reply. They were pronounced in sorrow, yet\nin hope, and they brought home to him, sharply, the nobility of the\nbishop's own sacrifice.\n\n\"And you, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ah,\" answered the bishop, \"with this I shall have had my life. I am\ncontent....\"\n\n\"You will come to me again, Hodder? some other day,\" he said, after\nan interval, \"that we may talk over the new problems. They are\nconstructive, creative, and I am anxious to hear how you propose to\nmeet them. For one thing, to find a new basis for the support of such a\nparish. I understand they have deprived you of your salary.\"\n\n\"I have enough to live on, for a year or so,\" replied the rector,\nquickly. \"Perhaps more.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" said the bishop, with a smile in his old eyes, \"that you\nwill need it, my friend. But who can say? You have strength, you have\nconfidence, and God is with you.\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nLife, as Hodder now grasped it, was a rapidly whirling wheel which gave\nhim no chance to catch up with the impressions and experiences through\nwhich it was dragging him. Here, for instance, were two far-reaching\nand momentous events, one crowding upon the other, and not an hour for\nreflection, realization, or adjustment! He had, indeed, after his return\nfrom the bishop's, snatched a few minutes to write Alison the unexpected\nresult of that interview. But even as he wrote and rang for a messenger\nto carry the note to Park Street, he was conscious of an effort to seize\nupon and hold the fact that the woman he had so intensely desired was\nnow his helpmate; and had, of her own freewill, united herself with him.\nA strong sense of the dignity of their relationship alone prevented his\ncalling her on the telephone--as it doubtless had prevented her. While\nshe remained in her father's house, he could not...\n\nIn the little room next to the office several persons were waiting to\nsee him. But as he went downstairs he halted on the landing, his hand\ngoing to his forehead, a reflex movement significant of a final attempt\nto achieve the hitherto unattainable feat of imagining her as his wife.\nIf he might only speak to her again--now, this morning! And yet he\nknew that he needed no confirmation. The reality was there, in the\nbackground; and though refusing to come forward to be touched, it had\nalready grafted itself as an actual and vital part of his being, never\nto be eliminated.\n\nCharacteristically perfecting his own ideal, she had come to him in the\nhour when his horizon had been most obscure. And he experienced now an\nexultation, though solemn and sacred, that her faith had so far been\nrewarded in the tidings he now confided to the messenger. He was not, as\nyet, to be driven out from the task, to be deprived of the talent, the\nopportunity intrusted to him by Lord--the emancipation of the parish of\nSt. John's.\n\nThe first to greet him, when he entered his office, was one who, unknown\nto himself, had been fighting the battle of the God in Christ, and\nwho now, thanks to John Hodder, had identified the Spirit as the\ntransforming force. Bedloe Hubbell had come to offer his services to the\nChurch. The tender was unqualified.\n\n\"I should even be willing, Mr. Hodder,\" he said with a smile, \"to\nventure occasionally into a pulpit. You have not only changed my\nconception of religion, but you have made it for me something which I\ncan now speak about naturally.\"\n\nHodder was struck by the suggestion.\n\n\"Ah, we shall need the laymen in the pulpits, Mr. Hubbell,\" he said\nquickly. \"A great spiritual movement must be primarily a lay movement.\nAnd I promise you you shall not lack for opportunity.\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\nAt nine o'clock that evening, when a reprieve came, Hodder went out.\nAnxiety on the score of Kate Marcy, as well as a desire to see Mr.\nBentley and tell him of the conversation with the bishop, directed his\nsteps toward Dalton Street. And Hodder had, indeed, an intention of\nconfiding to his friend, as one eminently entitled to it, the news of\nhis engagement to Alison Parr.\n\nNothing, however, had been heard of Kate. She was not in Dalton Street,\nMr. Bentley feared. The search of Gratz, the cabinet-maker, had been\nfruitless. And Sally Grover had even gone to see the woman in the\nhospital, whom Kate had befriended, in the hope of getting a possible\nclew. They sat close together before the fire in Mr. Bentley's\ncomfortable library, debating upon the possibility of other methods of\nprocedure, when a carriage was heard rattling over the pitted asphalt\nwithout. As it pulled up at the curb, a silence fell between them. The\ndoor-bell rang.\n\nHolder found himself sitting erect, rigidly attentive, listening to the\nmuffled sound of a woman's voice in the entry. A few moments later came\na knock at the library door, and Sam entered. The old darky was plainly\nfrightened.\n\n\"It's Miss Kate, Marse Ho'ace, who you bin tryin' to fin',\" he\nstammered.\n\nHolder sprang to his feet and made his way rapidly around the table,\nwhere he stood confronting the woman in the doorway. There she was,\nperceptibly swaying, as though the floor under her were rocked by an\nearthquake. Her handsome face was white as chalk, her pupils widened in\nterror. It was curious, at such an instant, that he should have taken\nin her costume,--yet it was part of the mystery. She wore a new,\nclose-fitting, patently expensive suit of dark blue cloth and a small\nhat, which were literally transforming in their effect, demanding a\npalpable initial effort of identification.\n\nHe seized her by the arm.\n\n\"What is it?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" she cried. \"He--he's out there--in the carriage.\"\n\nShe leaned heavily against the doorpost, shivering.... Holder saw Sally\nGrover coming down the stairs.\n\n\"Take her,\" he said, and went out of the front door, which Sam had left\nopen. Mr. Bentley was behind him.\n\nThe driver had descended from the box and was peering into the darkness\nof the vehicle when he heard them, and turned. At sight of the tall\nclergyman, an expression of relief came into his face.\n\n\"I don't like the looks of this, sir,\" he said. \"I thought he was pretty\nbad when I went to fetch him--\"\n\nHolder pushed past him and looked into the carriage. Leaning back,\nmotionless, in the corner of the seat was the figure of a man. For a\nterrible moment of premonition, of enlightenment, the rector gazed at\nit.\n\n\"They sent for me from a family hotel in Ayers Street,\" the driver was\nexplaining. Mr. Bentley's voice interrupted him.\n\n\"He must be brought in, at once. Do you know where Dr. Latimer's office\nis, on Tower Street?\" he asked the man. \"Go there, and bring this doctor\nback with you as quickly as possible. If he is not in, get another,\nphysician.\"\n\nBetween them, the driver and Holder got the burden out of the carriage\nand up the steps. The light from the hallway confirmed the rector's\nfear.\n\n\"It's Preston Parr,\" he said.\n\nThe next moment was too dreadful for surprise, but never had the sense\nof tragedy so pierced the innermost depths of Holder's being as now,\nwhen Horace Bentley's calmness seemed to have forsaken him; and as he\ngazed down upon the features on the pillow, he wept.... Holder turned\naway. Whatever memories those features evoked, memories of a past that\nstill throbbed with life these were too sacred for intrusion. The years\nof exile, of uncomplaining service to others in this sordid street and\nover the wide city had not yet sufficed to allay the pain, to heal the\nwound of youth. Nay, loyalty had kept it fresh--a loyalty that was the\nhandmaid of faith...\n\nThe rector softly left the room, only to be confronted with another\nharrowing scene in the library, where a frantic woman was struggling in\nSally Grover's grasp. He went to her assistance... Words of comfort, of\nentreaty were of no avail,--Kate Marcy did not seem to hear them. Hers,\nin contrast to that other, was the unmeaning grief, the overwhelming\nsense of injustice of the child; and with her regained physical strength\nthe two had all they could do to restrain her.\n\n\"I will go to him,\" she sobbed, between her paroxysms, \"you've got\nno right to keep me--he's mine... he came back to me--he's all I ever\nhad....\"\n\nSo intent were they that they did not notice Mr. Bentley standing beside\nthem until they heard his voice.\n\n\"What she says is true,\" he told them. \"Her place is in there. Let her\ngo.\"\n\nKate Marcy raised her head at the words, and looked at him a strange,\nhalf-comprehending, half-credulous gaze. They released her, helped her\ntowards the bedroom, and closed the door gently behind her... The three\nsat in silence until the carriage was heard returning, and the doctor\nentered.\n\nThe examination was brief, and two words, laconically spoken, sufficed\nfor an explanation--apoplexy, alcohol. The prostrate, quivering woman\nwas left where they had found her.\n\nDr. Latimer was a friend of Mr. Bentley's, and betrayed no surprise at a\nsituation which otherwise might have astonished him. It was only when\nhe learned the dead man's name, and his parentage, that he looked up\nquickly from his note book.\n\n\"The matter can be arranged without a scandal,\" he said, after an\ninstant. \"Can you tell me something of the circumstances?\"\n\nIt was Hodder who answered.\n\n\"Preston Parr had been in love with this woman, and separated from her.\nShe was under Mr. Bentley's care when he found her again, I infer, by\naccident. From what the driver says, they were together in a hotel in\nAyers Street, and he died after he had been put in a carriage. In her\nterror, she was bringing him to Mr. Bentley.\"\n\nThe doctor nodded.\n\n\"Poor woman!\" he said unexpectedly. \"Will you be good enough to let Mr.\nParr know that I will see him at his house, to-night?\" he added, as he\ntook his departure.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nSally Grower went out with the physician, and it was Mr. Bentley who\nanswered the question in the rector's mind, which he hesitated to ask.\n\n\"Mr. Parr must come here,\" he said.\n\nAs the rector turned, mechanically, to pick up his hat, Mr. Bentley\nadded,\n\n\"You will come back, Hodder?\"\n\n\"Since you wish it, sir,\" the rector said.\n\nOnce in the street, he faced a predicament, but swiftly decided that the\ntelephone was impossible under the circumstances, that there could be\nno decent procedure without going himself to Park Street. It was only\na little after ten. The electric car which he caught seemed to lag, the\nstops were interminable. His thoughts flew hither and thither. Should he\ntry first to see Alison? He was nearest to her now of all the world, and\nhe could not suffer the thought of her having the news otherwise. Yes,\nhe must tell her, since she knew nothing of the existence of Kate Marcy.\n\nHaving settled that,--though the thought of the blow she was to receive\nlay like a weight on his heart,--Mr. Bentley's reason for summoning\nEldon Parr to Dalton Street came to him. That the feelings of Mr.\nBentley towards the financier were those of Christian forgiveness was\nnot for a moment to be doubted: but a meeting, particularly under such\ncircumstances, could not but be painful indeed. It must be, it was,\nHodder saw, for Kate Marcy's sake; yes, and for Eldon Parr's as well,\nthat he be given this opportunity to deal with the woman whom he had\ndriven away from his son, and ruined.\n\nThe moon, which had shed splendours over the world the night before,\nwas obscured by a low-drifting mist as Hodder turned in between the\nornamental lamps that marked the gateway of the Park Street mansion,\nand by some undiscerned thought--suggestion he pictured the heart-broken\nwoman he had left beside the body of one who had been heir to all\nthis magnificence. Useless now, stone and iron and glass, pictures and\nstatuary. All the labour, all the care and cunning, all the stealthy\nplanning to get ahead of others had been in vain! What indeed were left\nto Eldon Parr! It was he who needed pity,--not the woman who had sinned\nand had been absolved because of her great love; not the wayward,\nvice-driven boy who lay dead. The very horror of what Eldon Parr was now\nto suffer turned Hodder cold as he rang the bell and listened for the\nsoft tread of the servant who would answer his summons.\n\nThe man who flung open the door knew him, and did not conceal his\nastonishment.\n\n\"Will you take my card to Miss Parr,\" the rector said, \"if she has not\nretired, and tell her I have a message?\"\n\n\"Miss Parr is still in the library, sir.\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The man preceded him, but before his name had been announced\nAlison was standing, her book in her hand, gazing at him with startled\neyes, his name rising, a low cry, to her lips.\n\n\"John!\"\n\nHe took the book from her, gently, and held her hands.\n\n\"Something has happened!\" she said. \"Tell me--I can bear it.\"\n\nHe saw instantly that her dread was for him, and it made his task the\nharder.\n\n\"It's your brother, Alison.\"\n\n\"Preston! What is it? He's done something----\"\n\nHodder shook his head.\n\n\"He died--to-night. He is at Mr. Bentley's.\"\n\nIt was like her that she did not cry out, or even speak, but stood\nstill, her hands tightening on his, her breast heaving. She was not, he\nknew, a woman who wept easily, and her eyes were dry. And he had it to\nbe thankful for that it was given him to be with her, in this sacred\nrelationship, at such a moment. But even now, such was the mystery that\never veiled her soul, he could not read her feelings, nor know what\nthese might be towards the brother whose death he announced.\n\n\"I want to tell you, first, Alison, to prepare you,\" he said.\n\nHer silence was eloquent. She looked up at him bravely, trustfully, in a\nway that made him wince. Whatever the exact nature of her suffering, it\nwas too deep for speech. And yet she helped him, made it easier for him\nby reason of her very trust, once given not to be withdrawn. It gave him\na paradoxical understanding of her which was beyond definition.\n\n\"You must know--you would have sometime to know that there was a woman\nhe loved, whom he intended to marry--but she was separated from him. She\nwas not what is called a bad woman, she was a working girl. I found her,\nthis summer, and she told me the story, and she has been under the care\nof Mr. Bentley. She disappeared two or three days ago. Your brother\nmet her again, and he was stricken with apoplexy while with her this\nevening. She brought him to Mr. Bentley's house.\"\n\n\"My father--bought her and sent her away.\"\n\n\"You knew?\"\n\n\"I heard a little about it at the time, by accident. I have always\nremembered it.... I have always felt that something like this would\nhappen.\"\n\nHer sense of fatality, another impression she gave of living in the\ndeeper, instinctive currents of life, had never been stronger upon him\nthan now.... She released his hands.\n\n\"How strange,\" she said, \"that the end should have come at Mr.\nBentley's! He loved my mother--she was the only woman he ever loved.\"\n\nIt came to Hodder as the completing touch of the revelation he had half\nglimpsed by the bedside.\n\n\"Ah,\" he could not help exclaiming, \"that explains much.\"\n\nShe had looked at him again, through sudden tears, as though divining\nhis reference to Mr. Bentley's grief, when a step make them turn. Eldon\nParr had entered the room. Never, not even in that last interview, had\nhis hardness seemed so concretely apparent as now. Again, pity seemed\nnever more out of place, yet pity was Hodder's dominant feeling as\nhe met the coldness, the relentlessness of the glance. The thing that\nstruck him, that momentarily kept closed his lips, was the awful,\nunconscious timeliness of the man's entrance, and his unpreparedness to\nmeet the blow that was to crush him.\n\n\"May I ask, Mr. Hodder,\" he said, in an unemotional voice, \"what you are\ndoing in this house?\"\n\nStill Hodder hesitated, an unwilling executioner.\n\n\"Father,\" said Alison, \"Mr. Hodder has come with a message.\"\n\nNever, perhaps, had Eldon Parr given such complete proof of his lack of\nspiritual intuition. The atmosphere, charged with presage for him, gave\nhim nothing.\n\n\"Mr. Hodder takes a strange way of delivering it,\" was his comment.\n\nMercy took precedence over her natural directness. She laid her hand\ngently on his arm. And she had, at that instant, no thought of the long\nyears he had neglected her for her brother.\n\n\"It's about--Preston,\" she said.\n\n\"Preston!\" The name came sharply from Eldon Parr's lips. \"What about\nhim? Speak, can't you?\"\n\n\"He died this evening,\" said Alison, simply.\n\nHodder plainly heard the ticking of the clock on the mantel.... And the\ndrama that occurred was the more horrible because it was hidden; played,\nas it were, behind closed doors. For the spectators, there was only the\nblack wall, and the silence. Eldon Parr literally did nothing,--made no\ngesture, uttered no cry. The death, they knew, was taking place in\nhis soul, yet the man stood before them, naturally, for what seemed an\ninterminable time....\n\n\"Where is he?\" he asked.\n\n\"At Mr. Bentley's, in Dalton Street.\" It was Alison who replied again.\n\nEven then he gave no sign that he read retribution in the coincidence,\nbetrayed no agitation at the mention of a name which, in such a\nconnection, might well have struck the terror of judgment into his\nheart. They watched him while, with a firm step, he crossed the room and\npressed a button in the wall, and waited.\n\n\"I want the closed automobile, at once,\" he said, when the servant came.\n\n\"I beg pardon; sir, but I think Gratton has gone to bed. He had no\norders.\"\n\n\"Then wake him,\" said Eldon Parr, \"instantly. And send for my\nsecretary.\"\n\nWith a glance which he perceived Alison comprehended, Hodder made his\nway out of the room. He had from Eldon Parr, as he passed him, neither\nquestion, acknowledgment, nor recognition. Whatever the banker\nmight have felt, or whether his body had now become a mere machine\nmechanically carrying on a life-long habit of action, the impression was\none of the tremendousness of the man's consistency. A great effort was\ndemanded to summon up the now almost unimaginable experience of his\nconfidence; of the evening when, almost on that very spot, he had\nrevealed to Hodder the one weakness of his life. And yet the effort was\nnot to be, presently, without startling results. In the darkness of the\nstreet the picture suddenly grew distinct on the screen of the rector's\nmind, the face of the banker subtly drawn with pain as he had looked\ndown on it in compassion; the voice with its undercurrent of agony:\n\n\"He never knew how much I cared--that what I was doing was all for him,\nbuilding for him, that he might carry on my work.\"\n\n\n\nV\n\nSo swift was the trolley that ten minutes had elapsed, after Hodder's\narrival, before the purr of an engine and the shriek of a brake broke\nthe stillness of upper Dalton Street and announced the stopping of a\nheavy motor before the door. The rector had found Mr. Bentley in the\nlibrary, alone, seated with bent head in front of the fire, and had\nsimply announced the intention of Eldon Parr to come. From the chair\nHodder had unobtrusively chosen, near the window, his eyes rested on the\nnoble profile of his friend. What his thoughts were, Hodder could not\nsurmise; for he seemed again, marvellously, to have regained the outward\npeace which was the symbol of banishment from the inner man of all\nthought of self.\n\n\"I have prepared her for Mr. Parr's coming,\" he said to Hodder at\nlength.\n\nAnd yet he had left her there! Hodder recalled the words Mr. Bentley had\nspoken, \"It is her place.\" Her place, the fallen woman's, the place she\nhad earned by a great love and a great renunciation, of which no earthly\npower might henceforth deprive her....\n\nThen came the motor, the ring at the door, the entrance of Eldon Parr\ninto the library. He paused, a perceptible moment, on the threshold\nas his look fell upon the man whom he had deprived of home and\nfortune,--yes and of the one woman in the world for them both. Mr.\nBentley had risen, and stood facing him. That shining, compassionate\ngaze should have been indeed a difficult one to meet. Vengeance was\nthe Lord's, in truth! What ordeal that Horace Bentley in anger and\nretribution might have devised could have equalled this!\n\nAnd yet Eldon Parr did meet it--with an effort. Hodder, from his corner,\ndetected the effort, though it were barely discernible, and would have\npassed a scrutiny less rigid,--the first outward and visible sign of\nthe lesion within. For a brief instant the banker's eyes encountered\nMr. Bentley's look with a flash of the old defiance, and fell, and then\nswept the room.\n\n\"Will you come this way, Mr. Parr?\" Mr. Bentley said, indicating the\ndoor of the bedroom.\n\nAlison followed. Her eyes, wet with unheeded tears, had never left Mr.\nBentley's face. She put out her hand to him....\n\nEldon Parr had halted abruptly. He knew from Alison the circumstances\nin which his son had died, and how he had been brought hither to this\nhouse, but the sight of the woman beside the bed fanned into flame his\nfury against a world which had cheated him, by such ignominious means,\nof his dearest wish. He grew white with sudden passion.\n\n\"What is she doing here?\" he demanded.\n\nKate Marcy, who had not seemed to hear his entrance, raised up to him\na face from which all fear had fled, a face which, by its suggestive\npower, compelled him to realize the absolute despair clutching now at\nhis own soul, and against which he was fighting wildly, hopelessly. It\nwas lying in wait for him, With hideous patience, in the coming watches\nof the night. Perhaps he read in the face of this woman whom he had\ncondemned to suffer all degradation, and over whom he was now powerless,\nsomething which would ultimately save her from the hell now yawning for\nhim; a redeeming element in her grief of which she herself were not\nas yet conscious, a light shining in the darkness of her soul which in\neternity would become luminous. And he saw no light for him--He thrashed\nin darkness. He had nothing, now, to give, no power longer to deprive.\nShe had given all she possessed, the memorial of her kind which would\noutlast monuments.\n\nIt was Alison who crossed the room swiftly. She laid her hand\nprotectingly on Kate Marcy's shoulder, and stooped, and kissed her. She\nturned to her father.\n\n\"It is her right,\" she said. \"He belonged to her, not to us. And we must\ntake her home with us.\n\n\"No,\" answered Kate Marcy' \"I don't want to go. I wouldn't live,\" she\nadded with unexpected intensity, \"with him.\"\n\n\"You would live with me,\" said Alison.\n\n\"I don't want to live!\" Kate Marcy got up from the chair with an energy\nthey had not thought her to possess, a revival of the spirit which had\nupheld her when she had contended, singly, with a remorseless world. She\naddressed herself to Eldon Parr. \"You took him from me, and I was a fool\nto let you. He might have saved me and saved himself. I listened to you\nwhen you told me lies as to how it would ruin him.... Well,--I had him\nyou never did.\"\n\nThe sudden, intolerable sense of wrong done to her love, the swift anger\nwhich followed it, the justness of her claim of him who now lay in the\ndignity of death clothed her--who in life had been crushed and blotted\nout--with a dignity not to be gainsaid. In this moment of final\nself-assertion she became the dominating person in the room, knew for\nonce the birthright of human worth. They watched her in silence as she\nturned and gave one last, lingering look at the features of the dead;\nstretched out her hand towards them, but did not touch them... and then\nwent slowly towards the door. Beside Alison she stopped.\n\n\"You are his sister?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe searched Alison's face, wistfully.\n\n\"I could have loved you.\"\n\n\"And can you not--still?\"\n\nKate Mercy did not answer the question.\n\n\"It is because you understand,\" she said. \"You're like those I've come\nto know--here. And you're like him.... I don't mean in looks. He, too,\nwas good--and square.\" She spoke the words a little defiantly, as though\nchallenging the verdict of the world. \"And he wouldn't have been wild if\nhe could have got going straight.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Alison, in a low voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kate Mercy, \"you look as if you did. He thought a lot of\nyou, he said he was only beginning to find out what you was. I'd like\nyou to think as well of me as you can.\"\n\n\"I could not think better,\" Alison replied.\n\nKate Mercy shook her head.\n\n\"I got about as low as any woman ever got,\" she said\n\n\"Mr. Hodder will tell you. I want you to know that I wouldn't\nmarry--your brother,\" she hesitated over the name. \"He wanted me to--he\nwas mad with me to night, because I wouldn't--when this happened.\"\n\nShe snatched her hand free from Alison's, and fled out of the room, into\nthe hallway.\n\nEldon Parr had moved towards the bed, seemingly unaware of the words\nthey had spoken. Perhaps, as he gazed upon the face, he remembered in\nhis agony the sunny, smiling child who need to come hurrying down the\nsteps in Ransome Street to meet him.\n\nIn the library Mr. Bentley and John Hodder, knowing nothing of her\nflight, heard the front door close on Kate Marcy forever....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. LIGHT\n\n\nI\n\nTwo days after the funeral, which had taken place from Calvary, and not\nfrom St. John's, Hodder was no little astonished to receive a note from\nEldon Parr's secretary requesting the rector to call in Park Street. In\nthe same mail was a letter from Alison. \"I have had,\" she wrote, \"a talk\nwith my father. The initiative was his. I should not have thought of\nspeaking to him of my affairs so soon after Preston's death. It seems\nthat he strongly suspected our engagement, which of course I at once\nacknowledged, telling him that it was your intention, at the proper\ntime, to speak to him yourself.\n\n\"I was surprised when he said he would ask you to call. I confess that I\nhave not an idea of what he intends to say to you, John, but I trust you\nabsolutely, as always. You will find him, already, terribly changed. I\ncannot describe it--you will see for yourself. And it has all seemed\nto happen so suddenly. As I wrote you, he sat up both nights, with\nPreston--he could not be induced to leave the room. And after the first\nnight he was different. He has hardly spoken a word, except when he sent\nfor me this evening, and he eats nothing.... And yet, somehow, I do not\nthink that this will be the end. I feel that he will go on living.....\n\n\"I did not realize how much he still hoped about Preston. And on Monday,\nwhen Preston so unexpectedly came home, he was happier than I have known\nhim for years. It was strange and sad that he could not see, as I saw,\nthat whatever will power my brother had had was gone. He could not read\nit in the face of his own son, who was so quick to detect it in all\nothers! And then came the tragedy. Oh, John, do you think we shall ever\nfind that girl again?--I know you are trying but we mustn't rest until\nwe do. Do you think we ever shall? I shall never forgive myself for not\nfollowing her out of the door, but, I thought she had gone to you and\nMr. Bentley.\"\n\nHodder laid the letter down, and took it up again. He knew that Alison\nfelt, as he felt, that they never would find Kate Marcy.... He read on.\n\n\"My father wished to speak to me about the money. He has plans for much\nof it, it appears, even now. Oh. John, he will never understand. I want\nso much to see you, to talk to you--there are times when I am actually\nafraid to be alone, and without you. If it be weakness to confess that\nI need your reassurance, your strength and comfort constantly, then I am\nweak. I once thought I could stand alone, that I had solved all problems\nfor myself, but I know now how foolish I was. I have been face to face\nwith such dreadful, unimagined things, and in my ignorance I did not\nconceive that life held such terrors. And when I look at my father, the\nthought of immortality turns me faint. After you have come here this\nafternoon there can be no longer any reason why we should not meet, and\nall the world know it. I will go with you to Mr. Bentley's.\n\n\"Of course I need not tell you that I refused to inherit anything. But\nI believe I should have consented if I possibly could have done so. It\nseemed so cruel--I can think of no other word--to have, to refuse at\nsuch a moment. Perhaps I have been cruel to him all my life--I don't\nknow. As I look back upon everything, all our relations, I cannot see\nhow I could have been different. He wouldn't let me. I still believe to\nhave stayed with him would have been a foolish and useless sacrifice...\nBut he looked at me so queerly, as though he, too, had had a glimmering\nof what we might have been to each other after my mother died. Why is\nlife so hard? And why are we always getting glimpses of things when it\nis too late? It is only honest to say that if I had it to do all over\nagain, I should have left him as I did.\n\n\"It is hard to write you this, but he actually made the condition of my\nacceptance of the inheritance that I should not marry you. I really do\nnot believe I convinced him that you wouldn't have me take the money\nunder any circumstances. And the dreadful side of it all was that I had\nto make it plain to him--after what has happened that my desire to marry\nyou wasn't the main reason of my refusal. I had to tell him that even\nthough you had not been in question, I couldn't have taken what he\nwished to give me, since it had not been honestly made. He asked me why\nI went on eating the food bought with such money, living under his roof?\nBut I cannot, I will not leave him just yet.... It is two o'clock. I\ncannot write any more to-night.\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe appointed time was at the November dusk, hurried forward nearly an\nhour by the falling panoply of smoke driven westward over the Park by\nthe wet east wind. And the rector was conducted, with due ceremony, to\nthe office upstairs which he had never again expected to enter, where\nthat other memorable interview had taken place. The curtains were drawn.\nAnd if the green-shaded lamp--the only light in the room--had been\narranged by a master of dramatic effect, it could not have better served\nthe setting.\n\nIn spite of Alison's letter, Holder was unprepared for the ravages a few\ndays had made in the face of Eldon Parr. Not that he appeared older: the\nimpression was less natural, more sinister. The skin had drawn sharply\nover the cheek-bones, and strangely the eyes both contradicted and\nharmonized with the transformation of the features. These, too, had\nchanged. They were not dead and lustreless, but gleamed out of the\nshadowy caverns into which they had sunk, unyielding, indomitable in\ntorment,--eyes of a spirit rebellious in the fumes....\n\nThis spirit somehow produced the sensation of its being separated from\nthe body, for the movement of the hand, inviting Holder to seat himself,\nseemed almost automatic.\n\n\"I understand,\" said Eldon Parr, \"that you wish to marry my daughter.\"\n\n\"It is true that I am to marry Alison,\" Holder answered, \"and that I\nintended, later on, to come to inform you of the fact.\"\n\nHe did not mention the death of Preston. Condolences, under the\ncircumstances, were utterly out of the question.\n\n\"How do you propose to support her?\" the banker demanded.\n\n\"She is of age, and independent of you. You will pardon me if I reply\nthat this is a matter between ourselves,\" Holder said.\n\n\"I had made up my mind that the day she married you I would not only\ndisinherit her, but refuse absolutely, to have anything to do with her.\"\n\n\"If you cannot perceive what she perceives, that you have already by\nyour own life cut her off from you absolutely and that seeing her will\nnot mend matters while you remain relentless, nothing I can say will\nconvince you.\" Holder did not speak rebukingly. The utter uselessness\nof it was never more apparent. The man was condemned beyond all present\nreprieve, at least.\n\n\"She left me,\" exclaimed Eldon Parr, bitterly.\n\n\"She left you, to save herself.\"\n\n\"We need not discuss that.\"\n\n\"I am far from wishing to discuss it,\" Holder replied.\n\n\"I do not know why you have asked me to come here, Mr. Parr. It is clear\nthat your attitude has not changed since our last conversation. I tried\nto make it plain to you why the church could not accept your money. Your\nown daughter, cannot accept it.\"\n\n\"There was a time,\" retorted the banker, \"when you did not refuse to\naccept it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Holder replied, \"that is true.\" It came to him vividly then that\nit had been Alison herself who had cast the enlightening gleam which\nrevealed his inconsistency. But he did not defend himself.\n\n\"I can see nothing in all this, Mr. Hodder, but a species of insanity,\"\nsaid Eldon Parr, and there crept into his tone both querulousness and\nintense exasperation. \"In the first place, you insist upon marrying my\ndaughter when neither she nor you have any dependable means of support.\nShe never spared her criticisms of me, and you presume to condemn me,\na man who, if he has neglected his children, has done so because he has\nspent too much of his time in serving his community and his country, and\nwho has--if I have to say it myself--built up the prosperity which you\nand others are doing your best to tear down, and which can only result\nin the spread of misery. You profess to have a sympathy with the masses,\nbut you do not know them as I do. They cannot control themselves, they\nrequire a strong hand. But I am not asking for your sympathy. I have\nbeen misunderstood all my life, I have become used to ingratitude, even\nfrom my children, and from the rector of the church for which I have\ndone more than any other man.\"\n\nHodder stared at him in amazement.\n\n\"You really believe that!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Believe it!\" Eldon Parr repeated. \"I have had my troubles, as heavy\nbereavements as a man can have. All of them, even this of my son's\ndeath, all the ingratitude and lack of sympathy I have experienced--\"\n(he looked deliberately at Hodder) \"have not prevented me, do not\nprevent me to-day from regarding my fortune as a trust. You have\ndeprived St. John's, at least so long as you remain there, of some of\nits benefits, and the responsibility for that is on your own head. And I\nam now making arrangements to give to Calvary the settlement house which\nSt. John's should have had.\"\n\nThe words were spoken with such an air of conviction, of unconscious\nplausibility, as it were, that it was impossible for Hodder to doubt the\ngenuineness of the attitude they expressed. And yet it was more than his\nmind could grasp.... Horace Bentley, Richard Garvin, and the miserable\nwoman of the streets whom he had driven to destroy herself had made\nabsolutely no impression whatever! The gifts, the benefactions of Eldon\nParr to his fellow-men would go on as before!\n\n\"You ask me why I sent for you,\" the banker went on. \"It was primarily\nbecause I hoped to impress upon you the folly of marrying my daughter.\nAnd in spite of all the injury and injustice you have done me, I do not\nforget that you were once in a relationship to me which has been unique\nin my life. I trusted you, I admired you, for your ability, for your\nfaculty of getting on with men. At that time you were wise enough not to\nattempt to pass comment upon accidents in business affairs which are, if\ndeplorable, inevitable.\"\n\nEldon Parr's voice gave a momentary sign of breaking.\n\n\"I will be frank with you. My son's death has led me, perhaps weakly, to\nmake one more appeal. You have ruined your career by these chimerical,\nsocialistic notions you have taken up, and which you mistake for\nChristianity. As a practical man I can tell you, positively, that St.\nJohn's will run downhill until you are bankrupt. The people who come to\nyou now are in search of a new sensation, and when that grows stale\nthey will fall away. Even if a respectable number remain in your\ncongregation, after this excitement and publicity have died down, I have\nreason to know that it is impossible to support a large city church on\ncontributions. It has been tried again and again, and failed. You have\nborrowed money for the Church's present needs. When that is gone I\npredict that you will find it difficult to get more.\"\n\nThis had every indication of being a threat, but Hodder, out of sheer\ncuriosity, did not interrupt. And it was evident that the banker drew a\nwrong conclusion from his silence, which he may actually have taken for\nreluctant acquiescence. His tone grew more assertive.\n\n\"The Church, Mr. Hodder, cannot do without the substantial business men.\nI have told the bishop so, but he is failing so rapidly from old age\nthat I might as well not have wasted my breath. He needs an assistant, a\nsuffragan or coadjutor, and I intend to make it my affair to see that he\ngets one. When I remember him as he was ten years ago, I find it hard to\nbelieve that he is touched with these fancies. To be charitable, it is\nsenile decay. He seems to forget what I have done for him, personally,\nmade up his salary, paid his expenses at different times, and no appeal\nfor the diocese to me was ever in vain. But again, I will let that go.\n\n\"What I am getting at is this. You have made a mess of the affairs of\nSt. John's, you have made a mess of your life. I am willing to give you\nthe credit for sincerity. Some of my friends might not be. You want to\nmarry my daughter, and she is apparently determined to marry you. If you\nare sensible and resign from St. John's now I will settle on Alison a\nsufficient sum to allow you both to live in comfort and decency the\nrest of your lives. I will not have it said of me that I permitted my\ndaughter to become destitute.\"\n\nAfter he had finished, the rector sat for so long a time that the banker\nnervously shifted in his chair. The clergyman's look had a cumulative\nquality, an intensity which seemed to increase as the silence continued.\nThere was no anger in it, no fanaticism. On the contrary, the\nhigher sanity of it was disturbing; and its extraordinary\nimplication--gradually borne in upon Eldon Parr--was that he himself\nwere not in his right mind. The words, when they came, were a\nconfirmation of this inference.\n\n\"It is what I feared, Mr. Parr,\" he said. \"You are as yet incapable of\ncomprehending.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the banker, jerking his hand from the table.\n\nThe rector shook his head.\n\n\"If this great chastisement with which you have been visited has given\nyou no hint of the true meaning of life, nothing I can say will avail.\nIf you will not yet listen to the Spirit which is trying to make you\ncomprehend, how then will you listen to me? How am I to open your eyes\nto the paradox of truth, that he who would save his life shall lose it,\nthat it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than\nfor a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God? If you will not believe\nhim who said that, you will not believe me. I can only beg of you,\nstrive to understand, that your heart many be softened, that your\nsuffering soul may be released.\"\n\nIt is to be recorded, strangely, that Eldon Parr did not grow angry in\nhis turn. The burning eyes looked out at Hodder curiously, as at a\nbeing upon whom the vials of wrath were somehow wasted, against whom the\nweapons of power were of no account. The fanatic had become a phenomenon\nwhich had momentarily stilled passion to arouse interest... \"Art thou a\nmaster of Israel, and knowest not these things?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say\"--such was the question that sprang to Eldon Parr's\nlips--\"that you take the Bible literally? What is your point of view?\nYou speak about the salvation of souls, I have heard that kind of talk\nall my life. And it is easy, I find, for men who have never known\nthe responsibilities of wealth to criticize and advise. I regard\nindiscriminate giving as nothing less than a crime, and I have always\ntried to be painstaking and judicious. If I had taken the words you\nquoted at their face value, I should have no wealth to distribute\nto-day.\n\n\"I, too, Mr. Hodder, odd as it may seem to you, have had my dreams--of\ndoing my share of making this country the best place in the world to\nlive in. It has pleased providence to take away my son. He was not\nfitted to carry on my work,--that is the way--with dreams. I was to\nhave taught him to build up, and to give, as I have given. You think me\nembittered, hard, because I seek to do good, to interpret the Gospel in\nmy own way. Before this year is out I shall have retired from all active\nbusiness.\n\n\"I intend to spend the rest of my life in giving away the money I have\nearned--all of it. I do not intend to spare myself, and giving will be\nharder than earning. I shall found institutions for research of disease,\nhospitals, playgrounds, libraries, and schools. And I shall make the\nuniversity here one of the best in the country. What more, may I ask,\nwould you have me do?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" replied the rector, \"it is not what I would have you do. It is\nnot, indeed, a question of 'doing,' but of seeing.\"\n\n\"Of seeing?\" the banker repeated. \"As I say, of using judgment.\"\n\n\"Judgment, yes, but the judgment which has not yet dawned for you, the\nenlightenment which is the knowledge of God's will. Worldly wisdom is a\nrule of thumb many men may acquire, the other wisdom, the wisdom of the\nsoul, is personal--the reward of revelation which springs from desire.\nYou ask me what I think you should do. I will tell you--but you will not\ndo it, you will be powerless to do it unless you see it for yourself,\nunless the time shall come when you are willing to give up everything\nyou have held dear in life,--not your money, but your opinions, the very\njudgment and wisdom you value, until you have gained the faith which\nproclaims these worthless, until you are ready to receive the Kingdom of\nGod as a little child. You are not ready, now. Your attitude, your\nvery words, proclaim your blindness to all that has happened you, your\ndetermination to carry out, so far as it is left to you, your own will.\nYou may die without seeing.\"\n\nCrazy as it all sounded, a slight tremor shook Eldon Parr. There was\nsomething in the eyes, in the powerful features of the clergyman that\nkept him still, that made him listen with a fascination which had he\ntaken cognizance of it--was akin to fear. That this man believed it,\nthat he would impress it upon others, nay, had already done so, the\nbanker did not then doubt.\n\n\"You speak of giving,\" Hodder continued, \"and you have nothing to\ngive--nothing. You are poorer to-day than the humblest man who has seen\nGod. But you have much, you have all to restore.\" Without raising his\nvoice, the rector had contrived to put a mighty emphasis on the word.\n\"You speak of the labour of giving, but if you seek your God and haply\nfind him you will not rest night or day while you live until you have\nrestored every dollar possible of that which you have wrongfully taken\nfrom others.\"\n\nJohn Hodder rose and raised his arm in effective protest against the\ninterruption Eldon Parr was about to make. He bore him down.\n\n\"I know what you are going to say, Mr. Parr,--that it is not practical.\nThat word 'practical' is the barrier between you and your God. I tell\nyou that God can make anything practical. Your conscience, the spirit,\ntortures you to-day, but you have not had enough torture, you still\nthink to escape easily, to keep the sympathy of a world which despises\nyou. You are afraid to do what God would have you do. You have the\nopportunity, through grace, by your example to leave the world better\nthan you found it, to do a thing of such magnitude as is given to few\nmen, to confess before all that your life has been blind and wicked.\nThat is what the Spirit is trying to teach you. But you fear the\nridicule of the other blind men, you have not the faith to believe\nthat many eyes would be opened by your act. The very shame of such a\nconfession, you think, is not to be borne.\"\n\n\"Suppose I acknowledge, which I do not, your preposterous charge, how\nwould you propose to do this thing?\"\n\n\"It is very simple,\" said the rector, \"so far as the actual method of\nprocedure goes. You have only to establish a board of men in whom you\nhave confidence,--a court of claims, so to speak,--to pass upon the\nvalidity of every application, not from a business standpoint alone, but\nfrom one of a broad justice and equity. And not only that. I should\nhave it an important part of the duties of this board to discover\nfor themselves other claimants who may not, for various reasons, come\nforward. In the case of the Consolidated Tractions, for instances there\nare doubtless many men like Garvin who invested their savings largely\non the strength of your name. You cannot bring him back to life, restore\nhim to his family as he was before you embittered him, but it would be\na comparatively easy matter to return to his widow, with compound\ninterest, the sum which he invested.\"\n\n\"For the sake of argument,\" said Eldon Parr, \"what would you do with the\ninnumerable impostors who would overwhelm such a board with claims that\nthey had bought and sold stock at a loss? And that is only one case I\ncould mention.\"\n\n\"Would it be so dreadful a thing,\" asked Hodder, \"To run the risk of\nmaking a few mistakes? It would not be business, you say. If you had the\ndesire to do this, you would dismiss such an obsession from your brain,\nyou would prefer to err on the aide of justice and mercy. And no matter\nhow able your board, in making restitution you could at best expect to\nmend only a fraction of the wrongs you have done.\"\n\n\"I shall waive, for the moment, my contention that the Consolidated\nTractions Company, had it succeeded, would greatly have benefited the\ncity. Even if it had been the iniquitous, piratical transaction you\nsuggest, why should I assume the responsibility for all who were\nconcerned in it?\"\n\n\"If the grace were given you to do this, that question would answer\nitself,\" the rector replied. \"The awful sense of responsibility, which\nyou now lack, would overwhelm you.\"\n\n\"You have made me out a rascal and a charlatan,\" said Eldon Parr, \"and I\nhave listened' patiently in my desire to be fair, to learn from your\nown lips whether there were anything in the extraordinary philosophy you\nhave taken up, and which you are pleased to call Christianity. If you\nwill permit me to be as frank as you have been, it appears to me as\nsheer nonsense and folly, and if it were put into practice the world\nwould be reduced at once to chaos and anarchy.\"\n\n\"There is no danger, I am sorry to say, of its being put into practice\nat once,\" said Hodder, smiting sadly.\n\n\"I hope not,\" answered the banker, dryly. \"Utopia is a dream in which\nthose who do the rough work of the world cannot afford to indulge. And\nthere is one more question. You will, no doubt, deride it as practical,\nbut to my mind it is very much to the point. You condemn the business\npractices in which I have engaged all my life as utterly unchristian. If\nyou are logical, you will admit that no man or woman who owns stock in a\nmodern corporation is, according to your definition, Christian, and, to\nuse your own phrase, can enter the Kingdom of God. I can tell you, as\none who knows, that there is no corporation in this country which, in\nthe struggle to maintain itself, is not forced to adopt the natural\nlaw of the survival of the fittest, which you condemn. Your own salary,\nwhile you had it, came from men who had made the money in corporations.\nBusiness is business, and admits of no sentimental considerations. If\nyou can get around that fact, I will gladly bow to your genius. Should\nyou succeed in reestablishing St. John's on what you call a free\nbasis--and in my opinion you will not--even then the money, you would\nlive on, and which supported the church, would be directly or indirectly\nderived from corporations.\"\n\n\"I do not propose to enter into an economics argument with you, Mr.\nParr, but if you tell me that the flagrant practices indulged in by\nthose who organized the Consolidated Tractions Company can be excused\nunder any code of morals, any conception of Christianity, I tell you\nthey cannot. What do we see today in your business world? Boards of\ndirectors, trusted by stockholders, betraying their trust, withholding\ninformation in order to profit thereby, buying and selling stock\nsecretly; stock watering, selling to the public diluted values,--all\nkinds of iniquity and abuse of power which I need not go into. Do you\nmean to tell me, on the plea that business is business and hence\na department by itself, that deception, cheating, and stealing are\njustified and necessary? The awakened conscience of the public is\ncondemning you.\n\n\"The time is at hand, though neither you nor I may live to see it,\nwhen the public conscience itself is beginning to perceive thin higher\njustice hidden from you. And you are attempting to mislead when you\ndo not distinguish between the men who, for their own gain and power,\nmismanage such corporations as are mismanaged, and those who own stock\nand are misled.\n\n\"The public conscience of which I speak is the leaven of Christianity at\nwork. And we must be content to work with it, to await its fulfilment,\nto realize that no one of us can change the world, but can only do his\npart in making it better. The least we can do is to refuse to indulge\nin practices which jeopardize our own souls, to remain poor if we cannot\nmake wealth honestly. Say what you will, the Christian government we\nare approaching will not recognize property, because it is gradually\nbecoming clear that the holding of property delays the Kingdom at which\nyou scoff, giving the man who owns it a power over the body of the man\nwho does not. Property produces slavery, since it compels those who have\nnone to work for those who have.\n\n\"The possession of property, or of sufficient property to give\none individual an advantage over his fellows is inconsistent with\nChristianity. Hence it will be done away with, but only when enough have\nbeen emancipated to carry this into effect. Hence the saying of our\nLord about the needle's eye--the danger to the soul of him who owns much\nproperty.\"\n\n\"And how about your Christian view of the world as a vale of tears?\"\nEldon Parr inquired.\n\n\"So long as humanity exists, there will always be tears,\" admitted the\nrector. \"But it is a false Christianity which does not bid us work for\nour fellow-men, to relieve their suffering and make the world brighter.\nIt is becoming clear that the way to do this effectively is through\ncommunities, cooperation, through nations, and not individuals. And\nthis, if you like, is practical,--so practical that the men like you,\nwho have gained unexampled privilege, fear it more and more. The old\nChristian misconception, that the world is essentially a bad place, and\nwhich has served the ends of your privilege, is going by forever. And\nthe motto of the citizens of the future will be the Christian motto, 'I\nam my brother's keeper.' The world is a good place because the Spirit is\ncontinually working in it, to make it better. And life is good, if only\nwe take the right view of it,--the revealed view.\"\n\n\"What you say is all very fine,\" said Eldon Parr. \"And I have heard it\nbefore, from the discontented, the socialists. But it does not take into\naccount the one essential element, human nature.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, your scheme of life fails to reckon with the greater\nfactor, divine nature,\" Hodder replied.\n\n\"When you have lived as long as I have, perhaps you will think\ndifferently, Mr. Hodder.\" Eldon Parr's voice had abruptly grown\nmetallic, as though the full realization had come over him of the\nseverity of the clergyman's arraignment; the audacity of the man who\nhad ventured to oppose him and momentarily defeated him, who had won\nthe allegiance of his own daughter, who had dared condemn him as an\nevil-doer and give advice as to his future course. He, Eldon Parr, who\nhad been used to settle the destinies of men! His anger was suddenly at\nwhite heat; and his voice, which he strove to control, betrayed it.\n\n\"Since you have rejected my offer, which was made in kindness, since you\nare bent on ruining my daughter's life as well as your own, and she has\ndisregarded my wishes, I refuse to see either of you, no matter to what\nstraits you may come, as long as I live. That is understood. And she\nleaves this house to-day, never to enter it again. It is useless to\nprolong this conversation, I think.\"\n\n\"Quite useless, as I feared, Mr. Parr. Do you know why Alison is willing\nto marry me? It is because the strength has been given me to oppose you\nin the name of humanity, and this in spite of the fact that her love for\nyou to-day is greater than it has ever been before. It is a part of the\nheavy punishment you have inflicted on yourself that you cannot believe\nin her purity. You insist on thinking that the time will come when\nshe will return to you for help. In senseless anger and pride you are\ndriving her away from you whom you will some day need. And in that day,\nshould God grant you a relenting heart to make the sign, she will come\nto you,--but to give comfort, not to receive it. And even as you have\nthreatened me, I will warn you, yet not in anger. Except a man be born\nagain, he cannot see the Kingdom of God, nor understand the motives of\nthose who would enter into it. Seek and pray for repentance.\"\n\nInfuriated though he was, before the commanding yet compassionate\nbearing of the rector he remained speechless. And after a moment's\npause, Hodder turned and left the room....\n\n\n\nIII\n\nWhen Hodder had reached the foot of the stairs, Alison came out to him.\nThe mourning she wore made her seem even taller. In the face upturned\nto his, framed in the black veil and paler than he had known it, were\ntraces of tears; in the eyes a sad, yet questioning and trustful smile.\nThey gazed at each other an instant, before speaking, in the luminous\necstasy of perfect communion which shone for them, undimmed, in the\nsurrounding gloom of tragedy. And thus, they felt, it would always\nshine. Of that tragedy of the world's sin and sorrow they would ever be\nconscious. Without darkness there could be no light.\n\n\"I knew,\" she said, reading his tidings, \"it would be of no use. Tell me\nthe worst.\"\n\n\"If you marry me, Alison, your father refuses to see you again. He\ninsists that you leave the house.\"\n\n\"Then why did he wish to see you?\"\n\n\"It was to make an appeal. He thinks, of course, that I have made\na failure of life, and that if I marry you I shall drag you down to\npoverty and disgrace.\"\n\nShe raised her head, proudly.\n\n\"But he knows that it is I who insist upon marrying you! I explained\nit all to him--how I had asked you. Of course he did not understand. He\nthinks, I suppose, that it is simply an infatuation.\"\n\nIn spite of the solemnity of the moment, Hodder smiled down at her,\ntouched by the confession.\n\n\"That, my dear, doesn't relieve me of responsibility. I am just as\nresponsible as though I had spoken first, instead of you.\"\n\n\"But, John, you didn't--?\" A sudden fear made her silent.\n\nHe took her hand and pressed it reassuringly.\n\n\"Give you up? No, Alison,\" he answered simply. \"When you came to me, God\nput you in my keeping.\"\n\nShe clung to him suddenly, in a passion of relief.\n\n\"Oh, I never could give you up, I never would unless you yourself told\nme to. Then I would do it,--for you. But you won't ask me, now?\"\n\nHe put his arm around her shoulders, and the strength of it seemed to\ncalm her.\n\n\"No, dear. I would make the sacrifice, ask you to make it, if it would\nbe of any good. As you say, he does not understand. And you couldn't go\non living with him and loving me. That solution is impossible. We can\nonly hope that the time will come when he will realize his need of you,\nand send for you.\"\n\n\"And did he not ask you anything more?\"\n\nHodder hesitated. He had intended to spare her that.... Her divination\nstartled him.\n\n\"I know, I know without your telling me. He offered you money, he\nconsented to our--marriage if you would give up St. John's. Oh, how\ncould he,\" she cried. \"How could he so misjudge and insult you!\"\n\n\"It is not me he misjudges, Alison, it is mankind, it is God. That is\nhis terrible misfortune.\" Hodder released her tenderly. \"You must see\nhim--you must tell him that when he needs you, you will come.\"\n\n\"I will see him now, she said. You will wait for, me?\"\n\n\"Now?\" he repeated, taken aback by her resolution, though it was\ncharacteristic.\n\n\"Yes, I will go as I am. I can send for my things. My father has given\nme no choice, no reprieve,--not that I ask one. I have you, dear. I will\nstay with Mr. Bentley to-night, and leave for New York to-morrow, to do\nwhat I have to do--and then you will be ready for me.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I shall be ready.\"\n\nHe lingered in the well-remembered hall.... And when at last she came\ndown again her eyes shone bravely through her tears, her look answered\nthe question of his own. There was no need for speech. With not so much\nas a look behind she left, with him, her father's house.\n\nOutside, the mist had become a drizzle, and as they went down the walk\ntogether beside the driveway she slipped her arm into his, pressing\nclose to his side. Her intuition was perfect, the courage of her love\nsublime.\n\n\"I have you, dear,\" she whispered, \"never in my life before have I been\nrich.\"\n\n\"Alison!\"\n\nIt was all he could say, but the intensity of his mingled feeling went\ninto the syllables of her name. An impulse made them pause and turn,\nand they stood looking back together at the great house which loomed the\ngreater in the thickening darkness, its windows edged with glow. Never,\nas in this moment when the cold rain wet their faces, had the thought of\nits comfort and warmth and luxury struck him so vividly; yes, and of its\nterror and loneliness now, of the tortured spirit in it that found no\nrest.\n\n\"Oh, John,\" she cried, \"if we only could!\"\n\nHe understood her. Such was the perfect quality of their sympathy that\nshe had voiced his thought. What were rain and cold, the inclemency of\nthe elements to them? What the beauty and the warmth of those great,\nempty rooms to Eldon Parr? Out of the heaven of their happiness they\nlooked down, helpless, into the horrors of the luxury of hell.\n\n\"It must be,\" he answered her, \"in God's good time.\"\n\n\"Life is terrible!\" she said. \"Think of what he must have done to\nsuffer so, to be condemned to this! And when I went to him, just now, he\nwouldn't even kiss me good-by. Oh, my dear, if I hadn't had you to take\nme, what should I have done?... It never was a home to me--to any of us.\nAnd as I look back now, all the troubles began when we moved into it.\nI can only think of it as a huge prison, all the more sinister for its\ncostliness.\"\n\nA prison! It had once been his own conceit. He drew her gently away, and\nthey walked together along Park Street towards the distant arc-light at\nthe corner which flung a gleaming band along the wet pavement.\n\n\"Perhaps it was because I was too young to know what trouble was when we\nlived in Ransome Street,\" she continued. \"But I can remember now how\nsad my mother was at times--it almost seemed as though she had a\npremonition.\" Alison's voice caught....\n\nThe car which came roaring through the darkness, and which stopped\nprotestingly at their corner, was ablaze with electricity, almost filled\nwith passengers. A young man with a bundle changed his place in order\nthat they might sit together in one of the little benches bordering\nthe aisle; opposite them was a laughing, clay-soiled group of labourers\ngoing home from work; in front, a young couple with a chubby child. He\nstood between his parents, facing about, gazing in unembarrassed wonder\nat the dark lady with the veil. Alison's smile seemed only to increase\nthe solemnity of his adoration, and presently he attempted to climb over\nthe barrier between them. Hodder caught him, and the mother turned in\nalarm, recapturing him.\n\n\"You mustn't bother the lady, Jimmy,\" she said, when she had thanked\nthe rector. She had dimpled cheeks and sparkling blue eyes, but their\nexpression changed as they fell on Alison's face, expressing something\nof the wonder of the child's.\n\n\"Oh, he isn't bothering me,\" Alison protested. \"Do let him stand.\"\n\n\"He don't make up to everybody,\" explained the mother, and the manner of\nher speech was such a frank tribute that Alison flushed. There had been,\ntoo, in the look the quick sympathy for bereavement of the poor.\n\n\"Aren't they nice?\" Alison leaned over and whispered to Hodder, when the\nwoman had turned back. \"One thing, at least, I shall never regret,--that\nI shall have to ride the rest of my life in the streetcars. I love them.\nThat is probably my only qualification, dear, for a clergyman's wife.\"\n\nHodder laughed. \"It strikes me,\" he said, \"as the supreme one.\"\n\nThey came at length to Mr. Bentley's door, flung open in its usual\nwide hospitality by Sam. Whatever theist fortunes, they would always be\nwelcome here.... But it turned out, in answer to their question, that\ntheir friend was not at home.\n\n\"No, sah,\" said Sam, bowing and smiling benignantly, \"but he done tole\nme to say, when you and Miss Alison come, hit was to make no diffunce,\ndat you bofe was to have supper heah. And I'se done cooked it--yassah.\nWill you kindly step into the liba'y, suh, and Miss Alison? Dar was a\nlady 'crost de city, Marse Ho'ace said--yassah.\"\n\n\"John,\" said Alison with a questioning smile, when they were alone\nbefore the fire, \"I believe he went out on purpose,--don't you?--just\nthat we might be here alone.\"\n\n\"He knew we were coming?\"\n\n\"I wrote him.\"\n\n\"I think he might be convicted on the evidence,\" Hodder agreed. \"But--?\"\nHis question remained unasked.\n\nAlison went up to him. He had watched her, absorbed and fascinated, as\nwith her round arms gracefully lifted in front of the old mirror she had\ntaken off her hat and veil; smoothing, by a few deft touches, the dark\ncrown of her hair. The unwonted intimacy of the moment, invoking as it\ndid an endless reflection of other similar moments in their future life\ntogether, was in its effect overwhelming, bringing with it at last\na conviction not to be denied. Her colour rose as she faced him, her\nlashes fell.\n\n\"Did you seriously think, dear, that we could have deceived Mr. Bentley?\nThen you are not as clever as I thought you. As soon as it happened I\nsent him a note? that very night. For I felt that he ought to be told\nfirst of all.\"\n\n\"And as usual,\" Hodder answered, \"you were right.\"\n\nSupper was but a continuation of that delicious sense of intimacy.\nAnd Sam, beaming in his starched shirt and swallow-tail, had an air of\npresiding over a banquet of state. And for that matter, none had ever\ngone away hungry from this table, either for meat or love. It was,\nindeed, a consecrated meal,--consecrated for being just there. Such was\nthe tact which the old darky had acquired from his master that he left\nthe dishes on the shining mahogany board, and bowed himself out.\n\n\"When you wants me, Miss Alison, des ring de bell.\"\n\nShe was seated upright yet charmingly graceful, behind the old English\ncoffee service which had been Mr. Bentley's mother's. And it was she\nwho, by her wonderful self-possession, by the reassuring smile she gave\nhim as she handed him his cup, endowed it all with reality.\n\n\"It's strange,\" she said, \"but it seems as though I had been doing it\nall my life, instead of just beginning.\"\n\n\"And you do it as though you had,\" he declared.\n\n\"Which is a proof,\" she replied, \"of the superior adaptability of\nwomen.\"\n\nHe did not deny it. He would not then, in truth, have disputed her\nwildest statement... But presently, after they had gone back into the\nlibrary and were seated side by side before the coals, they spoke again\nof serious things, marvelling once more at a happiness which could be\ntinged and yet unmarred by vicarious sorrow. Theirs was the soberer,\nprofounder happiness of gratitude and wonder, too wise to exult, but\nwhich of itself is exalted; the happiness which praises, and passes\nunderstanding.\n\n\"There are many things I want to say to you, John,\" she told him,\nonce, \"and they trouble me a little. It is only because I am so utterly\ndevoted to you that I wish you to know me as I am. I have always had\nqueer views, and although much has happened to change me since I have\nknown and loved you, I am not quite sure how much those views have\nchanged. Love,\" she added, \"plays such havoc with one's opinions.\"\n\nShe returned his smile, but with knitted brows.\n\n\"It's really serious--you needn't laugh. And it's only fair to you to\nlet you know the kind of a wife you are getting, before it is too late.\nFor instance, I believe in divorce, although I can't imagine it for us.\nOne never can, I suppose, in this condition--that's the trouble. I have\nseen so many immoral marriages that I can't think God intends people\nto live degraded. And I'm sick and tired of the argument that an\nindissoluble marriage under all conditions is good for society. That\na man or woman, the units of society, should violate the divine in\nthemselves for the sake of society is absurd. They are merely setting an\nexample to their children to do the same thing, which means that society\nin that respect will never get any better. In this love that has come\nto us we have achieved an ideal which I have never thought to reach. Oh,\nJohn, I'm sure you won't misunderstand me when I say that I would rather\ndie than have to lower it.\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered, \"I shall not misunderstand you.\"\n\n\"Even though it is so difficult to put into words what I mean. I don't\nfeel that we really need the marriage service, since God has already\njoined us together. And it is not through our own wills, somehow, but\nthrough his. Divorce would not only be a crime against the spirit, it\nwould be an impossibility while we feel as we do. But if love should\ncease, then God himself would have divorced us, punished us by taking\naway a priceless gift of which we were not worthy. He would have shut\nthe gates of Eden in our faces because we had sinned against the Spirit.\nIt would be quite as true to say 'whom God has put asunder no man may\njoin together.' Am I hurting you?\"\n\nHer hand was on the arm of his chair, and the act of laying his own on\nit was an assurance stronger than words. Alison sighed.\n\n\"Yes, I believed you would understand, even though I expressed myself\nbadly,--that you would help me, that you have found a solution. I used\nto regard the marriage service as a compromise, as a lowering of the\nideal, as something mechanical and rational put in the place of the\nspiritual; that it was making the Church, and therefore God, conform to\nthe human notion of what the welfare of society ought to be. And it is\nabsurd to promise to love. We have no control over our affections. They\nare in God's hands, to grant or withdraw.\n\n\"And yet I am sure--this is new since I have known you--that if such a\ngreat love as ours be withdrawn it would be an unpardonable wrong for\neither of us to marry again. That is what puzzles me--confounds the\nwisdom I used to have, and which in my littleness and pride I thought\nso sufficient. I didn't believe in God, but now I feel him, through\nyou, though I cannot define him. And one of many reasons why I could\nnot believe in Christ was because I took it for granted that he taught,\namong other things, a continuation of the marriage relation after love\nhad ceased to justify it.\"\n\nHodder did not immediately reply. Nor did Alison interrupt his silence,\nbut sat with the stillness which at times so marked her personality,\nher eyes trustfully fixed on him. The current pulsing between them was\nunbroken. Hodder's own look, as he gazed into the grate, was that of a\nseer.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said at length, \"it is by the spirit and not the letter of our\nLord's teaching that we are guided. The Spirit which we draw from the\nGospels. And everything written down there that does not harmonize with\nit is the mistaken interpretation of men. Once the Spirit possesses us\ntruly, we are no longer troubled and confused by texts.\n\n\"The alpha and omega of Christ's message is rebirth into the knowledge\nof that Spirit, and hence submission to its guidance. And that is what\nPaul meant when he said that it freed us from the law. You are right,\nAlison, when you declare it to be a violation of the Spirit for a man\nand woman to live together when love does not exist. Christ shows us\nthat laws were made for those who are not reborn. Laws are the rules of\nsociety, to be followed by those who have not found the inner guidance,\nwho live and die in the flesh. But the path which those who live under\nthe control of the Spirit are to take is opened up to them as they\njourney. If all men and women were reborn we should have the paradox,\nwhich only the reborn can understand, of what is best for the individual\nbeing best for society, because under the will of the Spirit none can\ntransgress upon the rights and happiness of others. The Spirit would\nmake the laws and rules superfluous.\n\n\"And the great crime of the Church, for which she is paying so heavy\nan expiation, is that her faith wavered, and she forsook the Spirit and\nresumed the law her Master had condemned. She no longer insisted on that\nwhich Christ proclaimed as imperative, rebirth. She became, as you say,\na mechanical organization, substituting, as the Jews had done, hard and\nfast rules for inspiration. She abandoned the Communion of Saints, sold\nher birthright for a mess of pottage, for worldly, temporal power when\nshe declared that inspiration had ceased with the Apostles, when she\nfailed to see that inspiration is personal, and comes through rebirth.\nFor the sake of increasing her membership, of dominating the affairs of\nmen, she has permitted millions who lived in the law and the flesh, who\npersisted in forcing men to live by the conventions and customs Christ\nrepudiated, and so stultify themselves, to act in Christ's name.\nThe unpardonable sin against the Spirit is to doubt its workings, to\nmaintain that society will be ruined if it be substituted for the\nrules and regulations supposed to make for the material comforts of the\nnations, but which in reality suppress and enslave the weak.\n\n\"Nevertheless in spite of the Church, marvellously through the Church\nthe germ of our Lord's message has come down to us, and the age in which\nwe live is beginning to realize its purport, to condemn the Church for\nher subservient rationalism.\n\n\"Let us apply the rule of the Spirit to marriage. If we examine the\nideal we shall see clearly that the marriage-service is but a symbol.\nLike baptism, it is a worthless and meaningless rite unless the man and\nthe woman have been born again into the Spirit, released from the law.\nIf they are still, as St. Paul would say, in the flesh, let them have,\nif they wish, a civil permit to live together, for the Spirit can have\nnothing to do with such an union. True to herself, the Church symbolizes\nthe union of her members, the reborn. She has nothing to do with laws\nand conventions which are supposedly for the good of society, nor is any\nunion accomplished if those whom she supposedly joins are not reborn.\nIf they are, the Church can neither make it or dissolve it, but merely\nconfirm and acknowledge the work of the Spirit. And every work of the\nSpirit is a sacrament. Not baptism and communion and marriage only, but\nevery act of life.\n\n\"Oh, John,\" she exclaimed, her eyes lighting, \"I can believe that! How\nbeautiful a thought! I see now what is meant when it is said that man\nshall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of\nthe mouth of God. That is the hourly guidance which is independent of\nthe law. And how terrible to think that all the spiritual beauty of\nsuch a religion should have been hardened into chapter and verse\nand regulation. You have put into language what I think of Mr.\nBentley,--that has acts are sacraments.... It is so simple when you\nexplain it this way. And yet I can see why it was said, too, that we\nmust become as children to understand it.\"\n\n\"The difficult thing,\" replied Holder, gravely, \"is to retain it, to\nhold it after we have understood it--even after we have experienced\nit. To continue to live in the Spirit demands all our effort, all our\ncourage and patience and faith. We cannot, as you say, promise to love\nfor life. But the marriage service, interpreted, means that we will use\nall our human endeavour, with the help of the Spirit, to remain in what\nmay be called the reborn state, since it is by the Spirit alone that\ntrue marriage is sanctified. When the Spirit is withdrawn, man and woman\nare indeed divorced.\n\n\"The words 'a sense of duty' belong to moral philosophy and not to\nreligion. Love annuls them. I do not mean to decry them, but the reborn\nare lifted far above them by the subversion of the will by which our\nwill is submitted to God's. It is so we develop, and become, as it\nwere, God. And hence those who are not married in the Spirit are not\nspiritually man and wife. No consecration has taken place, Church or\nno Church. If rebirth occurs later, to either or both, the individual\nconscience--which is the Spirit, must decide whether, as regards each\nother, they are bound or free, and we must stand or fall by that. Men\nobject that this is opening the door to individualism. What they fail\nto see is that the door is open, wide, to-day and can never again be\nclosed: that the law of the naturally born is losing its power, that\nthe worn-out authority of the Church is being set at naught because that\nauthority was devised by man to keep in check those who were not reborn.\nThe only check to material individualism is spiritual individualism,\nand the reborn man or woman cannot act to the detriment of his\nfellow-creatures.\"\n\nIn her turn she was silent, still gazing at him, her breath coming\ndeeply, for she was greatly moved.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said simply, \"I can see now why divorce between us would be\na sacrilege. I felt it, John, but I couldn't reason it out. It is the\nconsecration of the Spirit that justifies the union of the flesh. For\nthe Spirit, in that sense, does not deny the flesh.\"\n\n\"That would be to deny life,\" Hodder replied.\n\n\"I see. Why was it all so hidden!\" The exclamation was not addressed\nto him--she was staring pensively into the fire. But presently, with a\nswift movement, she turned to him.\n\n\"You will preach this, John,--all of it!\"\n\nIt was not a question, but the cry of a new and wider vision of his\ntask. Her face was transfigured. And her voice, low and vibrating,\nexpressed no doubts. \"Oh, I am proud of you! And if they put you out\nand persecute you I shall always be proud, I shall never know why it was\ngiven me to have this, and to live. Do you remember saying to me once\nthat faith comes to us in some human form we love? You are my faith. And\nfaith in you is my faith in humanity, and faith in God.\"\n\nEre he could speak of his own faith in her, in mankind, by grace of\nwhich he had been lifted from the abyss, there came a knock at the door.\nAnd even as they answered it a deeper knowledge filtered into their\nhearts.\n\nHorace Bentley stood before them. And the light from his face, that\nshone down upon them, was their benediction.\n\n\n\n\nAFTERWORD\n\nAlthough these pages have been published serially, it is with a feeling\nof reluctance that I send them out into the world, for better or worse,\nbetween the covers of a book. They have been written with reverence,\nand the reading of the proofs has brought back to me vividly the long\nwinters in which I pondered over the matter they contain, and wrote and\nrewrote the chapters.\n\nI had not thought to add anything to them by way of an afterword.\nNothing could be farther from my mind than to pose as a theologian; and,\nwere it not for one or two of the letters I have received, I should have\nsupposed that no reader could have thought of making the accusation that\nI presumed to speak for any one except myself. In a book of this\nkind, the setting forth of a personal view of religion is not only\nunavoidable, but necessary; since, if I wrote sincerely, Mr. Hodder's\nsolution must coincide with my own--so far as I have been able to work\none out. Such as it is, it represents many years of experience and\nreflection. And I can only crave the leniency of any trained theologian\nwho may happen to peruse it.\n\nNo one realizes, perhaps, the incompleteness of the religious\ninterpretations here presented more keenly than I. More significant,\nmore vital elements of the truth are the rewards of a mind which\nsearches and craves, especially in these days when the fruit of so many\nable minds lies on the shelves of library and bookshop. Since the last\nchapter was written, many suggestions have come to me which I should\nlike to have the time to develop for this volume. But the nature of\nthese elements is positive,--I can think of nothing I should care to\nsubtract.\n\nHere, then, so far as what may be called religious doctrine is\nconcerned, is merely a personal solution. We are in an age when the\ntruth is being worked out through many minds, a process which seems\nto me both Christian and Democratic. Yet a gentleman has so far\nmisunderstood this that he has already accused me, in a newspaper, of\ncommitting all the heresies condemned by the Council of Chalcedon,--and\nmore!\n\nI have no doubt that he is right. My consolation must be that I have as\ncompany--in some of my heresies, at least--a goodly array of gentlemen\nwho wear the cloth of the orthodox churches whose doctrines he accuses\nme of denying. The published writings of these clergymen are accessible\nto all. The same critic declares that my interpretations are without\n\"authority.\" This depends, of course; on one's view of \"authority.\" But\nhis accusation is true equally against many men who--if my observation\nbe correct--are doing an incalculable service for religion by giving\nto the world their own personal solutions, interpreting Christianity\nin terms of modern thought. No doubt these, too, are offending the\nchampions of the Council of Chalcedon.\n\nAnd does the gentleman, may I ask, ever read the pages of the Hibbert\nJournal?\n\nFinally, I have to meet a more serious charge, that Mr. Hodder remains\nin the Church because of \"the dread of parting with the old, strong\nanchorage, the fear of anathema and criticism, the thought of sorrowing\nand disapproving friends.\" Or perhaps he infers that it is I who keep\nMr. Hodder in the Church for these personal reasons. Alas, the concern\nof society is now for those upon whom the Church has lost her hold, who\nare seeking for a solution they can accept. And the danger to-day is not\nfrom the side of heresy. The rector of St. John's, as a result of his\nstruggle, gained what I believe to be a higher and surer faith than that\nwhich he formerly held, and in addition to this the realization of the\npresence of a condition which was paralyzing the Church's influence.\n\nOne thing I had hoped to make clear, that if Mr. Hodder had left the\nChurch under these circumstances he would have made the Great Refusal.\nThe situation which he faced demanded something of the sublime courage\nof his Master.\n\nLastly, may I be permitted to add that it is far from my intention to\nreflect upon any particular denomination.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":487,"split":"train"}
