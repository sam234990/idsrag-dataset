Too proud to beg, she is desperate. Frederick enters, sees her, and offers her money although it will mean he cannot pay for his own breakfast. She recognizes him as her son, absent for five years as a soldier. He has returned in order to find his birth certificate, necessary in order to find employment. Distraught, Agatha tells him that there is no certificate: she was seduced at the age of seventeen by Baron Wildenhaim upon promise of marriage. Despite the resulting pregnancy, the Baron broke his promise and married another, wealthier woman, and Agatha, turned out of her home, struggled to make ends meet and raise her son alone. Frederick is dismayed at the news, and to find his mother so destitute, and he arranges for her to stay with some charitable cottagers.\nAct II: Frederick leaves, intending to beg for money. Not knowing her relationship to him, the cottagers tell Agatha of the recent history of Baron Wildenhaim, now widowed and with a daughter. She faints.\nMeanwhile, reluctant to force her inclination as his own was forced, the Baron tries to determine whether or not his daughter, Amelia, loves the affected and foppish Count Cassel. It becomes clear to the audience that she instead loves Anhalt, a poor clergyman, and he her. It also becomes clear that the Baron regrets the misdeeds of his youth and has long sought, fruitlessly, to make amends.\nAct III: Frederick, desperate as his begging has been unsuccessful, attempts to rob the Baron and the Count as they go hunting, not knowing who they are. He is arrested.\nAnhalt speaks to Amelia about matrimony, at the Baron's request, but she in turn confesses her love for him and forces his own confession. They are interrupted by Verdun, a versifying butler, with the news of Frederick's attack on the Baron. The Baron enters and Amelia pleads for the life of the unknown young man, but the Baron is adamant on the grounds that an example must be made.\nAct IV: Amelia takes Frederick food and he discovers who it was that he had threatened. He asks to meet the Baron privately.\nAmelia reveals to her father information she learnt from Verdun about the Count's sexual immorality. The Baron confronts the Count; he replies that he is a man of the world, and reminds the Baron that many men have behaved likewise. Confused and embarrassed, the Baron dismisses him; Amelia re-enters and reveals her love for Anhalt. They are interrupted by Anhalt, who tells the Baron that Frederick is in the next room and wants a private interview. Frederick reveals their relationship to the Baron, and then leaves. The Baron is much affected.\nAct V: Anhalt goes to Agatha at the cottage and explains some circumstances which mitigate the Baron's previous conduct.\nFrederick, and then Anhalt, insist to the Baron that he must marry Agatha. After some agitation because of the social differences between them, he agrees, and in gratitude to Anhalt for his advice, agrees also to let him marry Amelia despite his poverty. Agatha enters the room and all are reconciled.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Lovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Vows, by Mrs. Inchbald\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

But I flatter myself such a vindication\nis not requisite to the enlightened reader, who, I trust, on comparing\nthis drama with the original, will at once see all my motives\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the\ndull admirer of mere verbal translation, it would be vain to endeavour\nto inspire with taste by instruction.\n\nWholly unacquainted with the German language, a literal translation of\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cChild of Love\u00e2\u0080\u009d was given to me by the manager of Covent Garden\nTheatre to be fitted, as my opinion should direct, for his stage. This\ntranslation, tedious and vapid as most literal translations are, had\nthe peculiar disadvantage of having been put into our language by a\nGerman\u00e2\u0080\u0094of course it came to me in broken English. It was no slight\nmisfortune to have an example of bad grammar, false metaphors and\nsimiles, with all the usual errors of feminine diction, placed before a\nfemale writer. But if, disdaining the construction of sentences,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nprecise decorum of the cold grammarian,\u00e2\u0080\u0094she has caught the spirit of\nher author,\u00e2\u0080\u0094if, in every altered scene,\u00e2\u0080\u0094still adhering to the nice\npropriety of his meaning, and still keeping in view his great\ncatastrophe,\u00e2\u0080\u0094she has agitated her audience with all the various\npassions he depicted, the rigid criticism of the closet will be but a\nslender abatement of the pleasure resulting from the sanction of an\napplauding theatre.\n\nIt has not been one of the least gratifications I have received from\nthe success of this play, that the original German, from which it is\ntaken, was printed in the year 1791; and yet, that during all the\nperiod which has intervened, no person of talents or literary knowledge\n(though there are in this country many of that description, who profess\nto search for German dramas) has thought it worth employment to make a\ntranslation of the work. I can only account for such an apparent\nneglect of Kotzebue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cChild of Love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the consideration of its\noriginal unfitness for an English stage, and the difficulty of making\nit otherwise\u00e2\u0080\u0094a difficulty which once appeared so formidable, that I\nseriously thought I must have declined it even after I had proceeded\nsome length in the undertaking.\n\nIndependently of objections to the character of the Count, the\ndangerous insignificance of the Butler, in the original, embarrassed me\nmuch. I found, if he was retained in the _Dramatis Person\u00c3\u00a6_, something\nmore must be supplied than the author had assigned him: I suggested the\nverses I have introduced; but not being blessed with the Butler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happy\nart of rhyming, I am indebted for them, except the seventh and eleventh\nstanzas in the first of his poetic stories, to the author of the\nprologue.\n\nThe part of Amelia has been a very particular object of my solicitude\nand alteration: the same situations which the author gave her remain,\nbut almost all the dialogue of the character I have changed: the\nforward and unequivocal manner in which she announces her affection to\nher lover, in the original, would have been revolting to an English\naudience: the passion of love, represented on the stage, is certain to\nbe insipid or disgusting, unless it creates smiles or tears: Amelia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlove, by Kotzebue, is indelicately blunt, and yet void of mirth or\nsadness: I have endeavoured to attach the attention and sympathy of the\naudience by whimsical insinuations, rather than coarse abruptness\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nsame woman, I conceive, whom the author drew, with the self-same\nsentiments, but with manners adapted to the English rather than the\nGerman taste; and if the favour in which this character is held by the\naudience, together with every sentence and incident which I have\npresumed to introduce in the play, may be offered as the criterion of\nmy skill, I am sufficiently rewarded for the task I have performed.\n\nIn stating the foregoing circumstances relating to this production, I\nhope not to be suspected of arrogating to my own exertions only, the\npopularity which has attended \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Child of Love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d under the title of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Vows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094the exertions of every performer engaged in the play\ndeservedly claim a share in its success; and I must sincerely thank\nthem for the high importance of their aid.\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE.\n\nWRITTEN BY JOHN TAYLOR, ESQ.\n\n_Spoken by Mr. MURRAY._\n\n\nPoets have oft\u00e2\u0080\u0099 declared, in doleful strain,\nThat o\u00e2\u0080\u0099er dramatic tracks they beat in vain,\nHopeless that novelty will spring to sight;\nFor life and nature are exhausted quite.\nThough plaints like these have rung from age to age,\nToo kind are writers to desert the stage;\nAnd if they, fruitless, search for unknown prey,\nAt least they dress _old game_ a _novel way_;\nBut such lamentings should be heard no more,\nFor modern taste turns Nature out of door;\nWho ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er again her former sway will boast,\nTill, to complete her works, _she starts a ghost_.\n    If such the mode, what can we hope to-night,\nWho rashly dare approach without a sprite?\nNo dreadful cavern, no midnight scream,\nNo rosin flames, nor e\u00e2\u0080\u0099en one flitting gleam.\nNought of the charms so potent to invite\nThe monstrous charms of terrible delight.\nOur present theme the German Muse supplies,\nBut rather aims to soften than surprise.\nYet, with her woes she strives some smiles to blend,\nIntent as well to cheer as to amend:\nOn her own native soil she knows the art\nTo charm the fancy, and to touch the heart.\nIf, then, she mirth and pathos can express,\nThough less engaging in an English dress,\nLet her from British hearts no peril fear,\nBut, as a STRANGER*, find a welcome here.\n\n* Hamlet.\n\n\n\n\nLOVERS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 VOWS.\n\n\n\n\nACT I.\n\nSCENE I.\n\n\n_A high road, a town at a distance\u00e2\u0080\u0094A small inn on one side of the\nroad\u00e2\u0080\u0094A cottage on the other._\n\n\n_The_ LANDLORD _of the inn leads_ AGATHA _by the hand out of his\nhouse._\n\n\nLANDLORD.\nNo, no! no room for you any longer\u00e2\u0080\u0094It is the fair to-day in the next\nvillage; as great a fair as any in the German dominions.

Many an honest\nwoman has been obliged to beg. Why should not you? [Agatha _sits down\nupon a large stone under a tree._] For instance, here comes somebody;\nand I will teach you how to begin. [_A Countryman, with working tools,\ncrosses the road._] Good day, neighbour Nicholas.\n\nCOUNTRYMAN\nGood day. [_Stops._]\n\nLANDLORD.\nWon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you give a trifle to this poor woman?

[_After a pause_] Protect his father too, merciful\nProvidence, and pardon his crime of perjury to me! Here, in the face of\nheaven (supposing my end approaching, and that I can but a few days\nlonger struggle with want and sorrow), here, I solemnly forgive my\nseducer for all the ills, the accumulated evils which his allurements,\nhis deceit, and cruelty, have for twenty years past drawn upon me.\n\n_Enter a_ COUNTRY GIRL _with a basket._\n\n\nAGATHA.\n[_near fainting_].

But have you obtained your discharge?\n\nFREDERICK.\nOh, no, mother\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have leave of absence only for two months; and that\nfor a particular reason. But I will not quit you so soon, now I find\nyou are in want of my assistance.\n\nAGATHA.\nNo, no, Frederick; your visit will make me so well, that I shall in a\nvery short time recover strength to work again; and you must return to\nyour regiment when your furlough is expired. But you told me leave of\nabsence was granted you for a particular reason.\u00e2\u0080\u0094What reason?\n\nFREDERICK.\nWhen I left you five years ago, you gave me every thing you could\nafford, and all you thought would be necessary for me. But one trifle\nyou forgot, which was, the certificate of my birth from the\nchurch-book.\u00e2\u0080\u0094You know in this country there is nothing to be done\nwithout it. At the time of parting from you, I little thought it could\nbe of that consequence to me which I have since found it would have\nbeen. Once I became tired of a soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, and in the hope I should\nobtain my discharge, offered myself to a master to learn a profession;\nbut his question was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is your certificate from the church-book\nof the parish in which you were born?\u00e2\u0080\u009d It vexed me that I had not it to\nproduce, for my comrades laughed at my disappointment. My captain\nbehaved kinder, for he gave me leave to come home to fetch it\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you\nsee, mother, here I am.\n\n[_During his speech_ Agatha _is confused and agitated._\n\n\nAGATHA.\nSo, you are come for the purpose of fetching your certificate from the\nchurch-book.\n\nFREDERICK.\nYes, mother.\n\nAGATHA.\nOh! oh!\n\nFREDERICK.\nWhat is the matter? [_She bursts into tears._] For heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake,\nmother, tell me what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\n\nAGATHA.\nYou have no certificate.\n\nFREDERICK.\nNo!\n\nAGATHA.\nNo.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The laws of Germany excluded you from being registered at your\nbirth\u00e2\u0080\u0094for\u00e2\u0080\u0094you are a natural son!\n\nFREDERICK.\n[_starts\u00e2\u0080\u0094after a pause_]. So!\u00e2\u0080\u0094And who is my father?\n\nAGATHA.\nOh Frederick, your wild looks are daggers to my heart. Another time.\n\nFREDERICK.\n[_endeavouring to conceal his emotion_]. No, no\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am still your son\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nyou are still my mother. Only tell me, who is my father?\n\nAGATHA.\nWhen we parted five years ago, you were too young to be intrusted with\na secret of so much importance.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But the time is come when I can, in\nconfidence, open my heart, and unload that burthen with which it has\nbeen long oppressed. And yet, to reveal my errors to my child, and sue\nfor his mild judgment on my conduct\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFREDERICK.\nYou have nothing to sue for; only explain this mystery.\n\nAGATHA.\nI will, I will. But\u00e2\u0080\u0094my tongue is locked with remorse and shame. You\nmust not look at me.\n\nFREDERICK.\nNot look at you! Cursed be that son who could find his mother guilty,\nalthough the world should call her so.\n\nAGATHA.\nThen listen to me, and take notice of that village, [_pointing_] of\nthat castle, and of that church. In that village I was born\u00e2\u0080\u0094in that\nchurch I was baptized. My parents were poor, but reputable farmers.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The\nlady of that castle and estate requested them to let me live with her,\nand she would provide for me through life. They resigned me; and at the\nage of fourteen I went to my patroness. She took pleasure to instruct\nme in all kinds of female literature and accomplishments, and three\nhappy years had passed under protection, when her only son, who was an\nofficer in the Saxon service, obtained permission to come home. I had\nnever seen him before\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was a handsome young man\u00e2\u0080\u0094in my eyes a prodigy;\nfor he talked of love, and promised me marriage. He was the first man\nwho had ever spoken to me on such a subject.\u00e2\u0080\u0094His flattery made me vain,\nand his repeated vows\u00e2\u0080\u0094Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look at me, dear Frederick!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can say no\nmore. [Frederick _with his eyes cast down, takes her hand, and puts it\nto his heart._] Oh! oh! my son! I was intoxicated by the fervent\ncaresses of a young, inexperienced, capricious man, and did not recover\nfrom the delirium till it was too late.\n\nFREDERICK.\n[_after a pause_]. Go on.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Let me know more of my father.\n\nAGATHA.\nWhen the time drew near that I could no longer conceal my guilt and\nshame, my seducer prevailed upon me not to expose him to the resentment\nof his mother. He renewed his former promises of marriage at her\ndeath;\u00e2\u0080\u0094on which relying, I gave him my word to be secret\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I have to\nthis hour buried his name deep in my heart.\n\nFREDERICK.\nProceed, proceed! give me full information\u00e2\u0080\u0094I will have courage to hear\nit all. [_Greatly agitated._]\n\nAGATHA.\nHis leave of absence expired, he returned to his regiment, depending on\nmy promise, and well assured of my esteem. As soon as my situation\nbecame known, I was questioned, and received many severe reproaches:\nbut I refused to confess who was my undoer; and for that obstinacy was\nturned from the castle.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I went to my parents; but their door was shut\nagainst me. My mother, indeed, wept as she bade me quit her sight for\never; but my father wished increased affliction might befall me.\n\nFREDERICK.\n[_weeping_]. Be quick with your narrative, or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll break my heart.\n\nAGATHA.\nI now sought protection from the old clergyman of the parish. He\nreceived me with compassion. On my knees I begged forgiveness for the\nscandal I had caused to his parishioners; promised amendment; and he\nsaid he did not doubt me. Through his recommendation I went to town;\nand hid in humble lodgings, procured the means of subsistence by\nteaching to the neighbouring children what I had learnt under the\ntuition of my benefactress.\u00e2\u0080\u0094To instruct you, my Frederick, was my care\nand delight; and in return for your filial love I would not thwart your\nwishes when they led to a soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life: but I saw you go from me with\nan aching heart. Soon after, my health declined, I was compelled to\ngive up my employment, and, by degrees, became the object you now see\nme. But, let me add, before I close my calamitous story, that\u00e2\u0080\u0094when I\nleft the good old clergyman, taking along with me his kind advice and\nhis blessing, I left him with a firm determination to fulfil the vow I\nhad made of repentance and amendment. I _have_ fulfilled it\u00e2\u0080\u0094and now,\nFrederick, you may look at me again. [_He embraces her._]\n\nFREDERICK.\nBut my father all this time? [_mournfully_] I apprehend he died.\n\nAGATHA.\nNo\u00e2\u0080\u0094he married.\n\nFREDERICK.\nMarried!\n\nAGATHA.\nA woman of virtue\u00e2\u0080\u0094of noble birth and immense fortune. Yet, [_weeps_] I\nhad written to him many times; had described your infant innocence and\nwants; had glanced obliquely at former promises\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFREDERICK.\n[_rapidly_]. No answer to these letters?\n\nAGATHA.\nNot a word.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But in time of war, you know, letters miscarry.\n\nFREDERICK.\nNor did he ever return to this estate?\n\nAGATHA.\nNo\u00e2\u0080\u0094since the death of his mother this castle has only been inhabited by\nservants\u00e2\u0080\u0094for he settled as far off as Alsace, upon the estate of his\nwife.\n\nFREDERICK.\nI will carry you in my arms to Alsace. No\u00e2\u0080\u0094why should I ever know my\nfather, if he is a villain! My heart is satisfied with a mother.\u00e2\u0080\u0094No\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nwill not go to him. I will not disturb his peace\u00e2\u0080\u0094I leave that task to\nhis conscience. What say you, mother, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we do without him?\n[_Struggling between tears and his pride._] We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want him. I will\nwrite directly to my captain. Let the consequence be what it will,\nleave you again I cannot. Should I be able to get my discharge, I will\nwork all day at the plough, and all the night with my pen. It will do,\nmother, it will do! Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goodness will assist me\u00e2\u0080\u0094it will prosper\nthe endeavours of a dutiful son for the sake of a helpless mother.\n\nAGATHA.\n[_presses him to her breast_]. Where could be found such another son?\n\nFREDERICK.\nBut tell me my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, that I may know how to shun him.\n\nAGATHA.\nBaron Wildenhaim.\n\nFREDERICK.\nBaron Wildenhaim! I shall never forget it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh! you are near fainting.\nYour eyes are cast down. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter? Speak, mother!\n\nAGATHA.\nNothing particular.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Only fatigued with talking. I wish to take a little\nrest.\n\nFREDERICK.\nI did not consider that we have been all this time in the open road.\n[_Goes to the Inn, and knocks at the door._] Here, Landlord!\n\nLANDLORD _re-enters._\n\n\nLANDLORD.\nWell, what is the matter now?\n\nFREDERICK.\nMake haste, and get a bed ready for this good woman.\n\nLANDLORD.\n[_with a sneer_]. A bed for this good woman! ha, ha ha! She slept last\nnight in that pent-house; so she may to-night. [_Exit, shutting the\ndoor._\n\nFREDERICK.\nYou are an infamous\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_goes back to his mother_] Oh! my poor\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_runs to the Cottage at a little distance, and knocks_]. Ha!\nhalloo! Who is there?\n\n_Enter_ COTTAGER.\n\n\nCOTTAGER.\nGood day, young soldier.\u00e2\u0080\u0094What is it you want?\n\nFREDERICK.\nGood friend, look at that poor woman. She is perishing in the public\nroad! It is my mother.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Will you give her a small corner in your hut? I\nbeg for mercy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake\u00e2\u0080\u0094Heaven will reward you.\n\nCOTTAGER.\nCan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you speak quietly? I understand you very well. [_Calls at the\ndoor of the hut._] Wife, shake up our bed\u00e2\u0080\u0094here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a poor sick woman\nwants it. [_Enter_ WIFE]. Why could not you say all this in fewer\nwords? Why such a long preamble? Why for mercy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, and heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nreward? Why talk about reward for such trifles as these? Come, let us\nlead her in; and welcome she shall be to a bed, as good as I can give\nher; and our homely fare.\n\nFREDERICK.\nTen thousand thanks, and blessings on you!\n\nWIFE.\nThanks and blessings! here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a piece of work indeed about nothing! Good\nsick lady, lean on my shoulder. [_To_ Frederick] Thanks and reward\nindeed! Do you think husband and I have lived to these years, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow our duty? Lean on my shoulder.

Nothing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nourishing.\n\nWIFE.\nRun, husband, run, and fetch a bottle of wine from the landlord of the\ninn.\n\nFREDERICK.\nNo, no\u00e2\u0080\u0094his wine is as bad as his heart: she has drank some of it, which\nI am afraid has turned to poison.\n\nCOTTAGER.\nSuppose, wife, you look for a new-laid egg?\n\nWIFE.\nOr a drop of brandy, husband\u00e2\u0080\u0094that mostly cures me.\n\nFREDERICK.\nDo you hear, mother\u00e2\u0080\u0094will you, mother? [Agatha _makes a sign with her\nhand as if she could not take any thing._] She will not. Is there no\ndoctor in this neighbourhood?\n\nWIFE.\nAt the end of the village there lives a horse-doctor. I have never\nheard of any other.\n\nFREDERICK.\nWhat shall I do? She is dying. My mother is dying.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Pray for her, good\npeople!\n\nAGATHA.\nMake yourself easy, dear Frederick, I am well, only weak\u00e2\u0080\u0094Some wholesome\nnourishment\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nFREDERICK.\nYes, mother, directly\u00e2\u0080\u0094directly. [_Aside_] Oh where shall I\u00e2\u0080\u0094no money\u00e2\u0080\u0094not\na farthing left.\n\nWIFE.\nOh, dear me! Had you not paid the rent yesterday, husband\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nCOTTAGER.\nI then, should know what to do. But as I hope for mercy, I have not a\npenny in my house.\n\nFREDERICK.\nThen I must\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_Apart, coming forward_]\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yes, I will go, and beg.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But\nshould I be refused\u00e2\u0080\u0094I will then\u00e2\u0080\u0094I leave my mother in your care, good\npeople\u00e2\u0080\u0094Do all you can for her, I beseech you! I shall soon be with you\nagain. [_Goes off in haste and confusion._]\n\nCOTTAGER.\nIf he should go to our parson, I am sure he would give him something.\n\n[Agatha _having revived by degrees during the scene, rises._]\n\n\nAGATHA.\nIs that good old man still living, who was minister here some time ago?\n\nWIFE.\nNo\u00e2\u0080\u0094It pleased Providence to take that worthy man to heaven two years\nago.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We have lost in him both a friend and a father. We shall never get\nsuch another.\n\nCOTTAGER.\nWife, wife, our present rector is likewise a very good man.\n\nWIFE.\nYes! But he is so very young.\n\nCOTTAGER.\nOur late parson was once young too.\n\nWIFE.\n[_to_ Agatha.] This young man being tutor in our Baron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, he was\nvery much beloved by them all; and so the Baron gave him this living in\nconsequence.\n\nCOTTAGER.\nAnd well he deserved it, for his pious instructions to our young lady:\nwho is, in consequence, good, and friendly to every body.\n\nAGATHA.\nWhat young lady do you mean?\n\nCOTTAGER.\nOur Baron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter.\n\nAGATHA.\nIs she here?\n\nWIFE.\nDear me! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know that? I thought every body had known that. It\nis almost five weeks since the Baron and all his family arrived at the\ncastle.\n\nAGATHA.\nBaron Wildenhaim?\n\nWIFE.\nYes, Baron Wildenhaim.\n\nAGATHA.\nAnd his lady?\n\nCOTTAGER.\nHis lady died in France many miles from hence, and her death, I\nsuppose, was the cause of his coming to this estate\u00e2\u0080\u0094For the Baron has\nnot been here till within these five weeks ever since he was married.\nWe regretted his absence much, and his arrival has caused great joy.\n\nWIFE.\n[_addressing her discourse to_ Agatha.] By all accounts the Baroness\nwas very haughty; and very whimsical.\n\nCOTTAGER.\nWife, wife, never speak ill of the dead. Say what you please against\nthe living, but not a word against the dead.\n\nWIFE.\nAnd yet, husband, I believe the dead care the least what is said\nagainst them\u00e2\u0080\u0094And so, if you please, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell my story. The late\nBaroness was, they say, haughty and proud; and they do say, the Baron\nwas not so happy as he might have been; but he, bless him, our good\nBaron is still the same as when a boy. Soon after Madam had closed her\neyes, he left France, and came to Waldenhaim, his native country.\n\nCOTTAGER.\nMany times has he joined in our village dances. Afterwards, when he\nbecame an officer, he was rather wild, as most young men are.\n\nWIFE.\nYes, I remember when he fell in love with poor Agatha, Friburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndaughter: what a piece of work that was\u00e2\u0080\u0094It did not do him much credit.\nThat was a wicked thing.\n\nCOTTAGER.\nHave done\u00e2\u0080\u0094no more of this\u00e2\u0080\u0094It is not well to stir up old grievances.\n\nWIFE.\nWhy, you said I might speak ill of the living. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis very hard indeed,\nif one must not speak ill of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neighbours, dead, nor alive.\n\nCOTTAGER.\nWho knows whether he was the father of Agatha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child? She never said\nhe was.\n\nWIFE.\nNobody but him\u00e2\u0080\u0094that I am sure\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would lay a wager\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, no husband\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\nmust not take his part\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was very wicked! Who knows what is now become\nof that poor creature? She has not been heard of this many a year. May\nbe she is starving for hunger. Her father might have lived longer too,\nif that misfortune had not happened.\n\n[Agatha _faints._]\n\n\nCOTTAGER.\nSee here! Help! She is fainting\u00e2\u0080\u0094take hold!\n\nWIFE.\nOh, poor woman!\n\nCOTTAGER.\nLet us take her into the next room.\n\nWIFE.\nOh poor woman!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am afraid she will not live. Come, chear up, chear\nup.\u00e2\u0080\u0094You are with those who feel for you.

Go, call my daughter hither.\n[_Exit_ Gentleman.] And am I after all to have an ape for a son-in-law?\nNo, I shall not be in a hurry\u00e2\u0080\u0094I love my daughter too well. We must be\nbetter acquainted before I give her to him. I shall not sacrifice my\nAmelia to the will of others, as I myself was sacrificed. The poor girl\nmight, in thoughtlessness, say yes, and afterwards be miserable. What a\npity she is not a boy! The name of Wildenhaim will die with me. My fine\nestates, my good peasants, all will fall into the hands of strangers.\nOh! why was not my Amelia a boy?\n\n_Enter_ AMELIA\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_She kisses the_ Baron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _hand_.]\n\n\nAMELIA.\nGood morning, dear my lord.\n\nBARON.\nGood morning, Amelia.

I always sleep well.\n\nBARON.\nNot a little restless last night?\n\nAMELIA.\nNo.\n\nBARON.\nAmelia, you know you have a father who loves you, and I believe you\nknow you have a suitor who is come to ask permission to love you.

As if he stood before you and the Count to ask for the ring.\n\nAMELIA.\nNo: not that\u00e2\u0080\u0094I dreamt we were all still in France, and he, my tutor,\njust going to take his leave of us for ever\u00e2\u0080\u0094I \u00e2\u0080\u0099woke with the fright,\nand found my eyes full of tears.\n\nBARON.\nPsha! I want to know if you can love the Count. You saw him at the last\nball we were at in France: when he capered round you; when he danced\nminuets; when he\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094. But I cannot say what his conversation was.\n\nAMELIA.\nNor I either\u00e2\u0080\u0094I do not remember a syllable of it.\n\nBARON.\nNo? Then I do not think you like him.\n\nAMELIA.\nI believe not.\n\nBARON.\nBut I think it proper to acquaint you he is rich, and of great\nconsequence: rich and of consequence; do you hear?\n\nAMELIA.\nYes, dear papa. But my tutor has always told me that birth and fortune\nare inconsiderable things, and cannot give happiness.\n\nBARON.\nThere he is right\u00e2\u0080\u0094But if it happens that birth and fortune are joined\nwith sense and virtue\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nAMELIA.\nBut is it so with Count Cassel?\n\nBARON.\nHem! Hem! [_Aside._] I will ask you a few questions on this subject;\nbut be sure to answer me honestly\u00e2\u0080\u0094Speak truth.\n\nAMELIA.\nI never told an untruth in my life.\n\nBARON.\nNor ever _conceal_ the truth from me, I command you.\n\nAMELIA.\n[_Earnestly._] Indeed, my lord, I never will.\n\nBARON.\nI take you at your word\u00e2\u0080\u0094And now reply to me truly\u00e2\u0080\u0094Do you like to hear\nthe Count spoken of?\n\nAMELIA.\nGood, or bad?\n\nBARON.\nGood.

[_stops short, and speaks\nsofter._] To see you happy is my wish. But matrimony, without concord,\nis like a duetto badly performed; for that reason, nature, the great\ncomposer of all harmony, has ordained, that, when bodies are allied,\nhearts should be in perfect unison.

But the whole system is exploded in places\nthat are civilized.\n\nAMELIA.\nAnd what is substituted in its stead?\n\nCOUNT.\nIntrigue.\n\nAMELIA.\nWhat a poor, uncomfortable substitute!\n\nCOUNT.\nThere are other things\u00e2\u0080\u0094Song, dance, the opera, and war.\n\n[_Since the entrance of the_ Count _the_ Baron _has removed to a table\nat a little distance._\n\n\nBARON.\nWhat are you talking of there?\n\nCOUNT.\nOf war, Colonel.\n\nBARON.\n[_rising_]. Ay, we like to talk on what we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand.\n\nCOUNT.\n[_rising_]. Therefore, to a lady, I always speak of politics; and to\nher father, on love.\n\nBARON.\nI believe, Count, notwithstanding your sneer, I am still as much a\nproficient in that art as yourself.\n\nCOUNT.\nI do not doubt it, my dear Colonel, for you are a soldier: and since\nthe days of Alexander, whoever conquers men is certain to overcome\nwomen.\n\nBARON.\nAn achievement to animate a poltroon.\n\nCOUNT.\nAnd, I verily believe, gains more recruits than the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pay.\n\nBARON.\nNow we are on the subject of arms, should you like to go out a shooting\nwith me for an hour before dinner?\n\nCOUNT.\nBravo, Colonel! A charming thought! This will give me an opportunity to\nuse my elegant gun: the but is inlaid with mother-of-pearl. You cannot\nfind better work, or better taste.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Even my coat of arms is engraved.\n\nBARON.\nBut can you shoot?\n\nCOUNT.\nThat I have never tried\u00e2\u0080\u0094except, with my eyes, at a fine woman.\n\nBARON.\nI am not particular what game I pursue.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have an old gun; it does not\nlook fine; But I can always bring down my bird.\n\n_Enter_ SERVANT.\n\n\nSERVANT.\nMr. Anhalt begs leave\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nBARON.\nTell him to come in.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I shall be ready in a moment. [_Exit_ Servant.\n\nCOUNT.\nWho is Mr. Anhalt?\n\nAMELIA.\nOh, a very good man. [_With warmth._]\n\nCOUNT.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA good man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In Italy, that means a religious man; in France, it means\na cheerful man; in Spain, it means a wise man; and in England, it means\na rich man.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Which good of all these is Mr. Anhalt?\n\nAMELIA.\nA good man in every country, except England.\n\nCOUNT.\nAnd give me the English good man, before that of any other nation.\n\nBARON.\nAnd of what nation would you prefer your good woman to be, Count?\n\nCOUNT.\nOf Germany. [_bowing to_ Amelia.]\n\nAMELIA.\nIn compliment to me?\n\nCOUNT.\nIn justice to my own judgment.\n\nBARON.\nCertainly. For have we not an instance of one German woman, who\npossesses every virtue that ornaments the whole sex; whether as a woman\nof illustrious rank, or in the more exalted character of a wife, and\nmother?\n\n_Enter Mr._ ANHALT.\n\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nI come by your command, Baron\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nBARON.\nQuick, Count.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Get your elegant gun.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I pass your apartments, and will\nsoon call for you.\n\nCOUNT.\nI fly.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Beautiful Amelia, it is a sacrifice I make to your father, that\nI leave for a few hours his amiable daughter. [_Exit._\n\nBARON.\nMy dear Amelia, I think it scarcely necessary to speak to Mr. Anhalt,\nor that he should speak to you, on the subject of the Count; but as he\nis here, leave us alone.\n\nAMELIA.\n[_as she retires_]. Good morning, Mr. Anhalt.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I hope you are very well.\n[_Exit._\n\nBARON.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you in a few words why I sent for you. Count Cassel is here,\nand wishes to marry my daughter.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\n[_much concerned_]. Really!\n\nBARON.\nHe is\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a word I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like him.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\n[_with emotion_]. And Miss Wildenhaim \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nBARON.\nI shall not command, neither persuade her to the marriage\u00e2\u0080\u0094I know too\nwell the fatal influence of parents on such a subject. Objections to be\nsure, if they could be removed\u00e2\u0080\u0094But when you find a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head without\nbrains, and his bosom without a heart, these are important articles to\nsupply. Young as you are, Anhalt, I know no one so able to restore, or\nto bestow those blessings on his fellow-creatures, as you. [Anhalt\n_bows._] The Count wants a little of my daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simplicity and\nsensibility.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Take him under your care while he is here, and make him\nsomething like yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u0094You have succeeded to my wish in the education\nof my daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Form the Count after your own manner.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I shall then have\nwhat I have sighed for all my life\u00e2\u0080\u0094a son.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nWith your permission, Baron, I will ask one question. What remains to\ninterest you in favour of a man, whose head and heart are good for\nnothing?\n\nBARON.\nBirth and fortune. Yet, if I thought my daughter absolutely disliked\nhim, or that she loved another, I would not thwart a first\naffection;\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, for the world, I would not. [_sighing._] But that her\naffections are already bestowed, is not probable.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nAre you of opinion that she will never fall in love?\n\nBARON.\nOh! no. I am of opinion that no woman ever arrived at the age of twenty\nwithout that misfortune.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But this is another subject.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Go to\nAmelia\u00e2\u0080\u0094explain to her the duties of a wife and of a mother.\u00e2\u0080\u0094If she\ncomprehends them, as she ought, then ask her if she thinks she could\nfulfil those duties, as the wife of Count Cassel.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nI will.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0094Miss Wildenhaim\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_confused._ I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I shall\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I shall obey\nyour commands.\n\nBARON.\nDo so. [_gives a deep sigh._] Ah! so far this weight is removed; but\nthere lies still a heavier next my heart.\u00e2\u0080\u0094You understand me.\u00e2\u0080\u0094How is it,\nMr. Anhalt? Have you not yet been able to make any discoveries on that\nunfortunate subject?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nI have taken infinite pains; but in vain. No such person is to be\nfound.\n\nBARON.\nBelieve me, this burthen presses on my thoughts so much, that many\nnights I go without sleep. A man is sometimes tempted to commit such\ndepravity when young.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh, Anhalt! had I, in my youth, had you for a\ntutor;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I had no instructor but my passions; no governor but my own\nwill. [_Exit._\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nThis commission of the Baron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in respect to his daughter, I am\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_looks\nabout_]\u00e2\u0080\u0094If I shou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d meet her now, I cannot\u00e2\u0080\u0094I must recover myself first,\nand then prepare.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A walk in the fields, and a fervent prayer\u00e2\u0080\u0094After\nthese, I trust, I shall return, as a man whose views are solely placed\non a future world; all hopes in this, with fortitude resigned.

I would rather fly to the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end. [_Looking\nat the money._] What can I buy with this? It is hardly enough to pay\nfor the nails that will be wanted for her coffin. My great anxiety will\ndrive me to distraction. However, let the consequence of our affliction\nbe what it may, all will fall upon my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head; and may he pant\nfor Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forgiveness, as my poor mother \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094 [_At a distance is heard\nthe firing of a gun, then the cry of Hallo, Hallo\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gamekeepers and\nSportsmen run across the stage\u00e2\u0080\u0094he looks about._] Here they come\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nnobleman, I suppose, or a man of fortune.

Aye, aye, that was a blunder indeed. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see\nthe dogs? There they run\u00e2\u0080\u0094they have lost the scent. [_Exit_ Baron\n_looking after the dogs._\n\nCOUNT.\nSo much the better, Colonel, for I must take a little breath. [_He\nleans on his gun_\u00e2\u0080\u0094Frederick _goes up to him with great modesty._]\n\nFREDERICK.\nGentleman, I beg you will bestow from your superfluous wants something\nto relieve the pain, and nourish the weak frame, of an expiring woman.\n\n_The_ BARON _re-enters._\n\n\nCOUNT.\nWhat police is here! that a nobleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amusements should be interrupted\nby the attack of vagrants.\n\nFREDERICK.\n[_to the Baron_]. Have pity, noble Sir, and relieve the distress of an\nunfortunate son, who supplicates for his dying mother.\n\nBARON.\n[_taking out his purse_]. I think, young soldier, it would be better if\nyou were with your regiment on duty, instead of begging.\n\nFREDERICK.\nI would with all my heart: but at this present moment my sorrows are\ntoo great.\u00e2\u0080\u0094[Baron _gives something._] I entreat your pardon. What you\nhave been so good as to give me is not enough.\n\nBARON.\n[_surprised_]. Not enough!\n\nFREDERICK.\nNo, it is not enough.\n\nCOUNT.\nThe most singular beggar I ever met in all my travels.\n\nFREDERICK.\nIf you have a charitable heart, give me one dollar.\n\nBARON.\nThis is the first time I was ever dictated by a beggar what to give\nhim.\n\nFREDERICK.\nWith one dollar you will save a distracted man.\n\nBARON.\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t choose to give any more. Count, go on.\n\n[_Exit_ Count\u00e2\u0080\u0094_as the_ Baron _follows_, Frederick _seizes him by the\nbreast and draws his sword._]\n\n\nFREDERICK.\nYour purse, or your life.\n\nBARON.\n[_calling_]. Here! here! seize and secure him.\n\n[_Some of the Gamekeepers run on, lay hold of_ Frederick, _and disarm\nhim._]\n\n\nFREDERICK.\nWhat have I done!\n\nBARON.\nTake him to the castle, and confine him in one of the towers. I shall\nfollow you immediately.\n\nFREDERICK.\nOne favour I have to beg, one favour only.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I know that I am guilty, and\nam ready to receive the punishment my crime deserves. But I have a\nmother, who is expiring for want\u00e2\u0080\u0094pity her, if you cannot pity me\u00e2\u0080\u0094bestow\non her relief. If you will send to yonder hut, you will find that I do\nnot impose on you a falsehood. For her it was I drew my sword\u00e2\u0080\u0094for her I\nam ready to die.\n\nBARON.\nTake him away, and imprison him where I told you.\n\nFREDERICK.\n[_as he is forced off by the keepers_]. Woe to that man to whom I owe\nmy birth! [_Exit._\n\nBARON.\n[_calls another Keeper_]. Here, Frank, run directly to yonder hamlet,\ninquire in the first, second, and third cottage for a poor sick\nwoman\u00e2\u0080\u0094and if you really find such a person, give her this purse. [_Exit\nGamekeeper._]\n\nBARON.\nA most extraordinary event!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what a well-looking youth! something in\nhis countenance and address which struck me inconceivably!\u00e2\u0080\u0094If it is\ntrue that he begged for his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0094But if he did\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the attempt upon\nmy life, he must die. Vice is never half so dangerous, as when it\nassumes the garb of morality. [_Exit._]\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n_A room in the Castle._\n\n\nAMELIA.\n[_alone._] Why am I so uneasy; so peevish; who has offended me? I did\nnot mean to come into this room. In the garden I intended to go\n[_going, turns back_]. No, I will not\u00e2\u0080\u0094yes, I will\u00e2\u0080\u0094just go, and look if\nmy auriculas are still in blossom; and if the apple tree is grown which\nMr. Anhalt planted.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I feel very low-spirited\u00e2\u0080\u0094something must be the\nmatter.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why do I cry?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Am I not well?\n\n_Enter Mr._ ANHALT.\n\n\nAh! good morning, my dear Sir\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mr. Anhalt, I meant to say\u00e2\u0080\u0094I beg pardon.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nNever mind, Miss Wildenhaim\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dislike to hear you call me as you\ndid.\n\nAMELIA.\nIn earnest?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nReally. You have been crying. May I know the reason? The loss of your\nmother, still?\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nAMELIA.\nNo\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have left off crying for her.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nI beg pardon if I have come at an improper hour; but I wait upon you by\nthe commands of your father.\n\nAMELIA.\nYou are welcome at all hours. My father has more than once told me that\nhe who forms my mind I should always consider as my greatest\nbenefactor. [_looking down_] And my heart tells me the same.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nI think myself amply rewarded by the good opinion you have of me.\n\nAMELIA.\nWhen I remember what trouble I have sometimes given you, I cannot be\ntoo grateful.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\n[_to himself_] Oh! Heavens!\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_to_ Amelia]. I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I come from your father\nwith a commission.\u00e2\u0080\u0094If you please, we will sit down. [_He places chairs,\nand they sit._] Count Cassel is arrived.\n\nAMELIA.\nYes, I know.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nAnd do you know for what reason?\n\nAMELIA.\nHe wishes to marry me.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nDoes he? [_hastily_] But believe me, the Baron will not persuade\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0094No, I am sure he will not.\n\nAMELIA.\nI know that.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nHe wishes that I should ascertain whether you have an inclination \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nAMELIA.\nFor the Count, or for matrimony do you mean?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nFor matrimony.\n\nAMELIA.\nAll things that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand, are quite\nindifferent to me.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nFor that very reason I am sent to you to explain the good and the bad\nof which matrimony is composed.\n\nAMELIA.\nThen I beg first to be acquainted with the good.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nWhen two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimony may\nbe called a happy life. When such a wedded pair find thorns in their\npath, each will be eager, for the sake of the other, to tear them from\nthe root. Where they have to mount hills, or wind a labyrinth, the most\nexperienced will lead the way, and be a guide to his companion.\nPatience and love will accompany them in their journey, while\nmelancholy and discord they leave far behind.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hand in hand they pass on\nfrom morning till evening, through their summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day, till the night\nof age draws on, and the sleep of death overtakes the one. The other,\nweeping and mourning, yet looks forward to the bright region where he\nshall meet his still surviving partner, among trees and flowers which\nthemselves have planted, in fields of eternal verdure.\n\nAMELIA.\nYou may tell my father\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll marry. [_Rises._]\n\nMR. ANHALT.\n[_rising_]. This picture is pleasing; but I must beg you not to forget\nthat there is another on the same subject.\u00e2\u0080\u0094When convenience, and fair\nappearance joined to folly and ill-humour, forge the fetters of\nmatrimony, they gall with their weight the married pair. Discontented\nwith each other\u00e2\u0080\u0094at variance in opinions\u00e2\u0080\u0094their mutual aversion increases\nwith the years they live together. They contend most, where they should\nmost unite; torment, where they should most soothe. In this rugged way,\nchoaked with the weeds of suspicion, jealousy, anger, and hatred, they\ntake their daily journey, till one of these _also_ sleep in death. The\nother then lifts up his dejected head, and calls out in acclamations of\njoy\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh, liberty! dear liberty!\n\nAMELIA.\nI will not marry.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nYou mean to say, you will not fall in love.\n\nAMELIA.\nOh no! [_ashamed_] I am in love.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nAre in love! [_starting_] And with the Count?\n\nAMELIA.\nI wish I was.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nWhy so?\n\nAMELIA.\nBecause _he_ would, perhaps, love me again.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\n[_warmly_]. Who is there that would not?\n\nAMELIA.\nWould you?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0094me\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am out of the question.\n\nAMELIA.\nNo; you are the very person to whom I have put the question.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nWhat do you mean?\n\nAMELIA.\nI am glad you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand me. I was afraid I had spoken too plain.\n[_in confusion_].\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nUnderstand you!\u00e2\u0080\u0094As to that\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am not dull.\n\nAMELIA.\nI know you are not\u00e2\u0080\u0094And as you have for a long time instructed me, why\nshould not I now begin to teach you?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nTeach me what?\n\nAMELIA.\nWhatever I know, and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nThere are some things I had rather never know.\n\nAMELIA.\nSo you may remember I said when you began to teach me mathematics. I\nsaid I had rather not know it\u00e2\u0080\u0094But now I have learnt it gives me a great\ndeal of pleasure\u00e2\u0080\u0094and [_hesitating_] perhaps, who can tell, but that I\nmight teach something as pleasant to you, as resolving a problem is to\nme.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nWoman herself is a problem.\n\nAMELIA.\nAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach you to make her out.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\n_You_ teach?\n\nAMELIA.\nWhy not? none but a woman can teach the science of herself: and though\nI own I am very young, a young woman may be as agreeable for a tutoress\nas an old one.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am sure I always learnt faster from you than from the\nold clergyman who taught me before you came.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nThis is nothing to the subject.\n\nAMELIA.\nWhat is the subject?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Love.\n\nAMELIA.\n[_going up to him_]. Come, then, teach it me\u00e2\u0080\u0094teach it me as you taught\nme geography, languages, and other important things.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\n[_turning from her_] Pshaw!\n\nAMELIA.\nAh! you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094You know you have already taught me that, and you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbegin again.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nYou misconstrue\u00e2\u0080\u0094you misconceive every thing I say or do. The subject I\ncame to you upon was marriage.\n\nAMELIA.\nA very proper subject from the man who has taught me love, and I accept\nthe proposal [_curtsying_].\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nAgain you misconceive and confound me.\n\nAMELIA.\nAy, I see how it is\u00e2\u0080\u0094You have no inclination to experience with me \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\ngood part of matrimony:\u00e2\u0080\u009d I am not the female with whom you would like\nto go \u00e2\u0080\u009chand in hand up hills, and through labyrinths\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094with whom you\nwould like to \u00e2\u0080\u009croot up thorns; and with whom you would delight to plant\nlilies and roses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No, you had rather call out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO liberty, dear\nliberty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMR.

But in plain truth, my Lord,\nthe Count was treacherous, cruel, forsworn.\n\nBARON.\nI am astonished!\n\nBUTLER.\nAnd would be more so if you would listen to the whole poem. [_Most\nearnestly_.] Pray, my Lord, listen to it.\n\nBARON.\nYou know the family?

You are accused, young man, of\nbeing engaged to another woman while you offer marriage to my child.\n\nCOUNT.\nTo only _one_ other woman?\n\nBARON.\nWhat do you mean?\n\nCOUNT.\nMy meaning is, that when a man is young and rich, has travelled, and is\nno personal object of disapprobation, to have made vows but to one\nwoman, is an absolute slight upon the rest of the sex.\n\nBARON.\nWithout evasion, Sir, do you know the name of Baden? Was there ever a\npromise of marriage made by you to his daughter? Answer me plainly: or\nmust I take a journey to inquire of the father?\n\nCOUNT.\nNo\u00e2\u0080\u0094he can tell you no more than, I dare say, you already know; and\nwhich I shall not contradict.\n\nBARON.\nAmazing insensibility!

Yes\u00e2\u0080\u0094I hope\u00e2\u0080\u0094I hope it is new.\n\nCOUNT.\nWhat, did you never meet with such a thing before?\n\nBARON.\n[_agitated_]. If I have\u00e2\u0080\u0094I pronounced the man who so offended\u00e2\u0080\u0094a villain.\n\nCOUNT.\nYou are singularly scrupulous. I question if the man thought himself\nso.\n\nBARON.\nYes he did.\n\nCOUNT.\nHow do you know?\n\nBARON.\n[_hesitating_]. I have heard him say so.\n\nCOUNT.\nBut he ate, drank, and slept, I suppose?\n\nBARON.\n[_confused_]. Perhaps he did.\n\nCOUNT.\nAnd was merry with his friends; and his friends as fond of him as ever?\n\nBARON.\nPerhaps [_confused_]\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps they were.\n\nCOUNT.\nAnd perhaps he now and then took upon him to lecture young men for\ntheir gallantries?\n\nBARON.\nPerhaps he did.\n\nCOUNT.\nWhy, then, after all, Baron, your villain is a mighty good, prudent,\nhonest fellow; and I have no objection to your giving me that name.\n\nBARON.\nBut do you not think of some atonement to the unfortunate girl?\n\nCOUNT.\nDid _your_ villain atone?\n\nBARON.\nNo: when his reason was matured, he wished to make some recompense; but\nhis endeavours were too late.\n\nCOUNT.\nI will follow his example, and wait till my reason is matured, before I\nthink myself competent to determine what to do.\n\nBARON.\nAnd till that time I defer your marriage with my daughter.\n\nCOUNT.\nWould you delay her happiness so long? Why, my dear Baron, considering\nthe fashionable life I lead, it may be ten years before my judgment\narrives to its necessary standard.\n\nBARON.\nI have the head-ach, Count\u00e2\u0080\u0094These tidings have discomposed, disordered\nme\u00e2\u0080\u0094I beg your absence for a few minutes.\n\nCOUNT.\nI obey\u00e2\u0080\u0094And let me assure you, my Lord, that, although, from the extreme\ndelicacy of your honour, you have ever through life shuddered at\nseduction; yet, there are constitutions, and there are circumstances,\nin which it can be palliated.\n\nBARON.\nNever [_violently_].\n\nCOUNT.\nNot in a grave, serious, reflecting man such as _you_, I grant. But in\na gay, lively, inconsiderate, flimsy, frivolous coxcomb, such as\nmyself, it is excusable: for me to keep my word to a woman, would be\ndeceit: \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis not expected of me. It is in my character to break oaths\nin love; as it is in your nature, my Lord, never to have spoken any\nthing but wisdom and truth.

You are not to marry\ncount Cassel\u00e2\u0080\u0094And now, mention his name to me no more.\n\nAMELIA.\nI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094indeed I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094for I hate his name.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But thank you, my dear\nfather, for this good news [_draws a chair, and sits on the opposite\nside of the table on which he leans.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And after a pause_] And who am I\nto marry?\n\nBARON.\n[_his head on his hand_]. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell.\n\n[Amelia _appears to have something on her mind which she wishes to\ndisclose_.]\n\n\nAMELIA.\nI never liked the Count.\n\nBARON.\nNo more did I.\n\nAMELIA.\n[_after a pause_]. I think love comes just as it pleases, without being\nasked.\n\nBARON.\nIt does so [_in deep thought_].\n\nAMELIA.\n[_after another pause_]. And there are instances where, perhaps, the\nobject of love makes the passion meritorious.\n\nBARON.\nTo be sure there are.\n\nAMELIA.\nFor example; my affection for Mr. Anhalt as my tutor.\n\nBARON.\nRight.\n\nAMELIA.\n[_after another pause_]. I should like to marry. [_sighing_.]\n\nBARON.\nSo you shall [_a pause_]. It is proper for every body to marry.\n\nAMELIA.\nWhy, then, does not Mr. Anhalt marry?\n\nBARON.\nYou must ask him that question yourself.\n\nAMELIA.\nI have.\n\nBARON.\nAnd what did he say?\n\nAMELIA.\nWill you give me leave to tell you what he said?\n\nBARON.\nCertainly.\n\nAMELIA.\nAnd you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be angry?\n\nBARON.\nUndoubtedly not.\n\nAMELIA.\nWhy, then\u00e2\u0080\u0094you know you commanded me never to disguise or conceal the\ntruth.\n\nBARON.\nI did so.\n\nAMELIA.\nWhy, then he said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nBARON.\nWhat did he say?\n\nAMELIA.\nHe said\u00e2\u0080\u0094he would not marry me without your consent for the world.\n\nBARON.\n[_starting from his chair_]. And pray, how came this the subject of\nyour conversation?\n\nAMELIA.\n[_rising_]. _I_ brought it up.\n\nBARON.\nAnd what did you say?\n\nAMELIA.\nI said that birth and fortune were such old-fashioned things to me, I\ncared nothing about either: and that I had once heard my father\ndeclare, he should consult my happiness in marrying me, beyond any\nother consideration.\n\nBARON.\nI will once more repeat to you my sentiments. It is the custom in this\ncountry for the children of nobility to marry only with their equals;\nbut as my daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content is more dear to me than an ancient custom,\nI would bestow you on the first man I thought calculated to make you\nhappy: by this I do not mean to say that I should not be severely nice\nin the character of the man to whom I gave you; and Mr. Anhalt, from\nhis obligations to me, and his high sense of honour, thinks too nobly\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nAMELIA.\nWould it not be noble to make the daughter of his benefactor happy?\n\nBARON.\nBut when that daughter is a child, and thinks like a child\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nAMELIA.\nNo, indeed, papa, I begin to think very like a woman. Ask _him_ if I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nBARON.\nAsk him! You feel gratitude for the instructions you have received from\nhim, and fancy it love.\n\nAMELIA.\nAre there two gratitudes?\n\nBARON.\nWhat do you mean?\n\nAMELIA.\nBecause I feel gratitude to you; but that is very unlike the gratitude\nI feel towards him.\n\nBARON.\nIndeed!\n\nAMELIA.\nYes; and then he feels another gratitude towards me. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\n\nBARON.\nHas he told you so?\n\nAMELIA.\nYes.\n\nBARON.\nThat was not right of him.\n\nAMELIA.\nOh! if you did but know how I surprized him!\n\nBARON.\nSurprized him?\n\nAMELIA.\nHe came to me by your command, to examine my heart respecting Count\nCassel. I told him that I would never marry the Count.\n\nBARON.\nBut him?\n\nAMELIA.\nYes, him.\n\nBARON.\nVery fine indeed! And what was his answer?\n\nAMELIA.\nHe talked of my rank in life; of my aunts and cousins; of my\ngrandfather, and great-grandfather; of his duty to you; and endeavoured\nto persuade me to think no more of him.\n\nBARON.\nHe acted honestly.\n\nAMELIA.\nBut not politely.\n\nBARON.\nNo matter.\n\nAMELIA.\nDear father! I shall never be able to love another\u00e2\u0080\u0094Never be happy with\nany one else. [_Throwing herself on her knees_.]\n\nBARON.\nRise, I command you.\n\n[_As she rises, enter_ ANHALT.]\n\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nMy Lord, forgive me! I have ventured, on the privilege of my office, as\na minister of holy charity, to bring the poor soldier, whom your\njustice has arrested, into the adjoining room; and I presume to entreat\nyou will admit him to your presence, and hear his apology, or his\nsupplication.\n\nBARON.\nAnhalt, you have done wrong. I pity the unhappy boy; but you know I\ncannot, must not forgive him.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nI beseech you then, my Lord, to tell him so yourself. From your lips he\nmay receive his doom with resignation.\n\nAMELIA.\nOh father! See him and take pity on him; his sorrows have made him\nfrantic.\n\nBARON.\nLeave the room, Amelia.

ANHALT.\nA man, who, if it so prove, is much concerned for your misfortunes.\n\nAGATHA.\nHow? Oh, Sir! tell me quickly\u00e2\u0080\u0094Whom do you think to find in me?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nAgatha Friburg.\n\nAGATHA.\nYes, I am that unfortunate woman; and the man who pretends to take\nconcern in my misfortunes is\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094Baron Wildenhaim\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094he who betrayed me,\nabandoned me and my child, and killed my parents.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He would now repair\nour sufferings with this purse of gold. [_Takes out the purse_.]\nWhatever may be your errand, Sir, whether to humble, or to protect me,\nit is alike indifferent. I therefore request you to take this money to\nhim who sent it. Tell him, my honour has never been saleable. Tell him,\ndestitute as I am, even indigence will not tempt me to accept charity\nfrom my seducer. He despised my heart\u00e2\u0080\u0094I despise his gold.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He has\ntrampled on me\u00e2\u0080\u0094I trample on his representative. [_Throws the purse on\nthe ground_.]\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nBe patient\u00e2\u0080\u0094I give you my word, that when the Baron sent this present to\nan unfortunate woman, for whom her son had supplicated, he did not know\nthat woman was Agatha.\n\nAGATHA.\nMy son? what of my son?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nDo not be alarmed\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Baron met with an affectionate son, who begged\nfor his sick mother, and it affected him.\n\nAGATHA.\nBegged of the Baron! of his father!\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nYes; but they did not know each other; and the mother received the\npresent on the son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account.\n\nAGATHA.\nDid not know each other? Where is my son?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nAt the Castle.\n\nAGATHA.\nAnd still unknown?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nNow he is known\u00e2\u0080\u0094an explanation has taken place;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I am sent here by\nthe Baron, not to a stranger, but to Agatha Friburg\u00e2\u0080\u0094not with gold! his\ncommission was\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cdo what your heart directs you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAGATHA.\nHow is my Frederick? How did the Baron receive him?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nI left him just in the moment the discovery was made. By this time your\nson is, perhaps, in the arms of his father.\n\nAGATHA.\nOh! is it possible that a man, who has been twenty years deaf to the\nvoice of nature, should change so suddenly?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nI do not mean to justify the Baron, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094he has loved you\u00e2\u0080\u0094and fear of\nhis noble kindred alone caused his breach of faith to you.\n\nAGATHA.\nBut to desert me wholly and wed another\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nWar called him away\u00e2\u0080\u0094Wounded in the field, he was taken to the adjacent\nseat of a nobleman, whose only daughter, by anxious attention to his\nrecovery, won his gratitude; and, influenced by the will of his worldly\nfriends, he married. But no sooner was I received into the family, and\nadmitted to his confidence, than he related to me your story; and at\ntimes would exclaim in anguish\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe proud imperious Baroness avenges\nthe wrongs of my deserted Agatha.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Again, when he presented me this\nliving, and I left France to take possession of it, his last words\nbefore we parted, were\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe moment you arrive at Wildenhaim, make all\nenquiries to find out my poor Agatha.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Every letter from him contained\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStill, still, no tidings of my Agatha.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And fate ordained it should be\nso, till this fortunate day.\n\nAGATHA.\nWhat you have said has made my heart overflow\u00e2\u0080\u0094where will this end?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nI know not yet the Baron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentions: but your sufferings demand\nimmediate remedy: and one way only is left\u00e2\u0080\u0094Come with me to the castle.\nDo not start\u00e2\u0080\u0094you shall be concealed in my apartments till you are\ncalled for.\n\nAGATHA.\nI go to the Baron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?\u00e2\u0080\u0094No.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nGo for the sake of your son\u00e2\u0080\u0094reflect, that his fortunes may depend upon\nyour presence.\n\nAGATHA.\nAnd he is the only branch on which my hope still blossoms: the rest are\nwithered.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I will forget my wrongs as a woman, if the Baron will atone\nto the mother\u00e2\u0080\u0094he shall have the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pardon, if he will merit the\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thanks\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_after a struggle_]\u00e2\u0080\u0094I _will_ go to the castle\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the\nsake of my Frederick, go even to his father. But where are my good host\nand hostess, that I may take leave, and thank them for their kindness?\n\nMR. ANHALT.\n[taking up the purse which Agatha had thrown down]. Here, good friend!\nGood woman!\n\n_Enter the_ COTTAGER _and his_ WIFE.\n\n\nWIFE.\nYes, yes, here I am.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nGood people, I will take your guest with me.

Do _you_ take it.\n\nWIFE.\nI always obey my pastor. [_taking it_].\n\nAGATHA.\nGood bye.

About a mile from this castle I\nhave an estate called Weldendorf\u00e2\u0080\u0094there she shall live, and call her own\nwhatever it produces. There she shall reign, and be sole mistress of\nthe little paradise. There her past sufferings shall be changed to\npeace and tranquility. On a summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s morning, we, my son, will ride to\nvisit her; pass a day, a week with her; and in this social intercourse\ntime will glide pleasantly.\n\nFREDERICK.\nAnd, pray, my Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0094under what name is my mother to live then?\n\nBARON.\n[_confused_].

[_Exit_.\n\nBARON.\nYoung man! Frederick!\u00e2\u0080\u0094[_calling after him_.] Hasty indeed! would make\nconditions with his father. No, no, that must not be. I just now\nthought how well I had arranged my plans\u00e2\u0080\u0094had relieved my heart of every\nburden, when, a second time, he throws a mountain upon it. Stop, friend\nconscience, why do you take his part?\u00e2\u0080\u0094For twenty years thus you have\nused me, and been my torture.\n\n_Enter Mr_. ANHALT.\n\n\nAh! Anhalt, I am glad you are come.

ANHALT.\nConscience is always right\u00e2\u0080\u0094because it never speaks unless it _is_ so.\n\nBARON.\nAy, a man of your order can more easily attend to its whispers, than an\nold warrior. The sound of cannon has made him hard of hearing.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have\nfound my son again, Mr. Anhalt, a fine, brave young man\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean to make\nhim my heir\u00e2\u0080\u0094Am I in the right?\n\nMR.

ANHALT.\nNow, then, it is my turn to state mine for the advice I have given you.\nBut first, I must presume to ask a few questions.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Did Agatha, through\nartful insinuation, gain your affection? or did she give you cause to\nsuppose her inconstant?\n\nBARON.\nNeither\u00e2\u0080\u0094but for me, she was always virtuous and good.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nDid it cost you trouble and earnest entreaty to make her otherwise?\n\nBARON.\n[_angrily_]. Yes.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nYou pledged your honour?\n\nBARON.\n[_confused_]. Yes.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nCalled God to witness?\n\nBARON.\n[_more confused_]. Yes.\n\nMR. ANHALT.\nThe witness you called at that time was the Being who sees you now.\nWhat you gave in pledge was your honour, which you must redeem.\nTherefore thank Heaven that it is in your _power_ to redeem it. By\nmarrying Agatha the ransom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made: and she brings a dower greater than\nany princess can bestow\u00e2\u0080\u0094peace to your conscience.

MUNDEN.\n\n\nOur drama now ended, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take up your time\nJust a moment or two in defence of my _rhime_\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n* \u00e2\u0080\u009cTho\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I hope that among you are _some_ who _admir\u00e2\u0080\u0099d_\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve hitherto said, dare I hope none are tir\u00e2\u0080\u0099d?\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut whether ye have, or have not heard enough,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr whether nice critics will think it all stuff;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo myself _rhime_ has ever appear\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, I must own,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn its nature a sort of _philosopher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stone_;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if Chymists wou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d use it, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d not make a pother,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd puzzle their brains to find out any other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIndeed \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis most strange and surprising to me\nThat all folks in _rhiming_ their int\u00e2\u0080\u0099rest can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see;\nFor I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure if its use were quite common with men,\nThe world would roll on just as pleasant again.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis said, that while ORPHEUS was striking his lyre,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrees and brutes danc\u00e2\u0080\u0099d along to the sound of the wire;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat AMPHION to walls soon converted the glebes,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they rose, as he sung, to a city call\u00e2\u0080\u0099d Thebes;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose _they_ were _Butlers_ (like me) of that time,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the tale shows our sires knew the wonders of _rhime_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFrom time immemorial, your lovers, we find,\nWhen their mistresses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hearts have been proud and unkind,\nHave resorted to _rhime_; and indeed it appears\nThat a _rhime_ would do more than a bucket of tears.\nOf love, from experience, I speak\u00e2\u0080\u0094odds my life!\nI shall never forget how I courted my wife:\nShe had offers in plenty; but always stood neuter,\nTill I, with my pen, started forth as a suitor;\nYet I made no mean present of _ribband_ or _bonnet_,\n_My_ present was caught from the stars\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas a _sonnet_.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now you know this, sure \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis needless to say,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat prose was neglected, and _rhime_ won the day\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut its potent effects you as well may discover\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the _husband_ and _wife_, as in _mistress_ and _lover_;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are some of ye here, who, like me, I conjecture.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave been lull\u00e2\u0080\u0099d into sleep by a good _curtain lecture_.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mere trifle; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er come to blows,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only avoid that dull enemy, _prose_.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAdopt, then, my plan, and the very next time,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat in words you fall out, let them fall into _rhime_;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus your sharpest disputes will conclude very soon,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd from jangling to jingling you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll chime into _tune_.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf my wife were to call me a _drunken old sot_,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d merely just ask her, what Butler is not?\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd bid her take care that she don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to pot.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo our squabbles continue a very short season,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she yields to my _rhime_\u00e2\u0080\u0094I allow she has reason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIndependent of this I conceive _rhime_ has weight\nIn the higher employments of church and of state,\nAnd would in my mind such advantages draw,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a pity that _rhime_ is not sanctioned by law;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor \u00e2\u0080\u0099twould _really_ be serving us all, to impose\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA capital fine on a man who spoke prose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMark the pleader who clacks, in his client\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf,\nHis technical stuff for three hours and a half;\nOr the fellow who tells you a long stupid story,\nAnd over and over the same lays before ye;\nOr the member who raves till the whole house are dosing\nWhat d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye say of such men? Why you say they are prosing.\nSo, of course, then, if _prose_ is so tedious a _crime_,\nIt of consequence follows, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _virtue_ in _rhime_.\nThe best piece of prose that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard a long while,\nIs what gallant Nelson has sent from THE NILE.\nAnd had he but told us the story in _rhime_,\nWhat a thing \u00e2\u0080\u0099twou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be; but, perhaps, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d no time.\nSo, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do it myself\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh! \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis glorious news!\nNine _sail_ of the line!

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n","id":380,"split":"train"}
