{"ori_id":"b67bc95cb196377649aacbf75c9dc42bfef6020e","title":"Lavender and Old Lace","context":"Lavender and Old Lace\n Miss Jane Hathaway is an astute pillar of a quaint coastal community, where her house sets atop a hill. She has long overcome the scandal created by her elder sister\u2019s elopement, though the sister died without her forgiveness. She\u2019s also aware of a child, although she\u2019s never met her niece. When she receives a letter from Ruth Thorne, her 34-year-old niece, suggesting an invitation to visit, she accepts, but leaves before Ruth arrives.\nAt Miss Hathaway\u2019s house, Ruth is given a mysterious letter. The letter, from Aunt Jane, does not explain her sudden trip abroad, but instructs Ruth to light an oil lamp in the attic each night.\nIn the attic, Ruth stumbles upon some mementos and keepsakes in an old trunk. Among the items is her aunt\u2019s wedding dress, made long ago and never worn. There\u2019s also some newspaper clippings; an announcement of marriage between Mr. Charles G. Winfield, captain of the schooner Mary, and Miss Abigail Weatherby. Ruth imagines that perhaps he was the man to whom her aunt\u2019s wedding dress was intended. Later, she finds a death notice of Mrs. Abigail Winfield, aged 22. Ruth feels ashamed and puts everything back, forcing it from her mind.\nIn the village, Ruth notices a young man, but does not make his acquaintance. Instead, she visits her aunt\u2019s childhood friend, Mary Ainslie, whom the locals call \"peculiar\", because she never leaves her house. Ruth is immediately taken with Miss Ainslie\u2019s saintly demeanor and quickly forms a friendship with her.\nRuth, who has resisted the urge to pillage her aunt\u2019s love letters, unwittingly stumbles onto a partial letter, which states, \"At Gibraltar for some time, keeping a shop, but will probably be found now in some small town on the coast of Italy. Very truly yours\". The signature has been torn.\nRuth's solitude is broken by Carl Winfield, a fellow journalist, who is staying in town at the suggestion of their mutual boss. She recognizes him as the young man she noticed earlier and finds him roguishly young and handsome; a great match for her.\nMr. Winfield suffers from an ocular ailment and must abstain from reading and writing. He's lodging at the Pendletons', and confides to Ruth that Joseph Pendleton and Hepsey, her aunt\u2019s maid, are courting. He asks Ruth to read the newspapers to him, and she agrees. Their time is well spent and on one of their many walks, they fall in love.\nMr. Winfield is also curious about Miss Ainslie, though Ruth is uncertain to introduce them. She inquires first and, out of curiosity for his surname, Miss Ainslie agrees to meet him.\nCarl Winfield is transformed by Miss Ainslie and confides that his own mother died when he was young. Although he does not remember her, he\u2019s been told awful stories about her vices, mainly alcoholism. Despite that Miss Ainslie is unmarried and has no children, he believes she\u2019s the vision of a perfect mother.\nMr. Winfield proposes to Ruth, and she accepts, although no date is set, then Joseph Pendleton proposes to Hepsey, and she accepts. With this much excitement, it's difficult to imagine the surprise when Aunt Jane returns, a married woman! Not trusting the \"heathen laws\" with which she was married, Aunt Jane rushes to put forth a Christian union with one priest and two witnesses, Ruth and Carl. The bridegroom, James Ball, is anything but thrilled. He has lived a long sailor\u2019s life and enjoyed his bachelor days no end. He also fancies younger women \u2013 like Ruth and Hepsey! To his credit, he is there upon his word, having proposed to Miss Hathaway 30 years ago! It turns out that he was the purpose of her trip to Italy.\nWhen Aunt Jane, now Mrs. Ball, discovers her husband\u2019s roving eye, she fires Hepsey and sends Ruth away, using her honeymoon as an excuse. Hepsey's and Joe's wedding is immediately put forth. Ruth, on the other hand, isn\u2019t ready to rush into marriage. She heads for Miss Ainslie\u2019s house instead. There, she knows, she will be comfortable for the duration of her holiday. Linens, china, and furniture make up the wedding gifts.\nWhile Ruth is staying with Miss Ainslie, the woman makes changes to her will, leaving everything to Ruth and Carl. Both insist they would rather have her, Carl especially. Strangely, Miss Ainslie and Carl share a dream about Carl's father. They confide it to Ruth, but she is unwilling to believe it is anything more than a coincidence. Nonetheless, it has changed Miss Ainslie and she has lost her will to live.\nIn the end, Ruth and Carl discover the truth: that Mary Ainslie was engaged to Charles G. Winfield, captain of the schooner Mary, but that he married Carl's mother, Abigail Weatherby, instead. After his wife died, he was too proud to come forward with his son, so he stayed away all those years. And all those years, Miss Ainslie was waiting for him. Her friend, Jane, knew this, but hadn't the heart to tell her. Instead, she lit the lamp in her attic for hers and Miss Ainslie's sailors to make their way back to them.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Lavender and Old Lace, by Myrtle Reed\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The Light in the Window\n\nA rickety carriage was slowly ascending the hill, and from the place of\nhonour on the back seat, the single passenger surveyed the country\nwith interest and admiration. The driver of that ancient chariot was\nan awkward young fellow, possibly twenty-five years of age, with sharp\nknees, large, red hands, high cheek-bones, and abundant hair of a shade\nverging upon orange. He was not unpleasant to look upon, however, for\nhe had a certain evident honesty, and he was disposed to be friendly to\nevery one.\n\n\"Be you comfortable, Miss?\" he asked, with apparent solicitude.\n\n\"Very comfortable, thank you,\" was the quiet response. He urged his\nvenerable steeds to a gait of about two miles an hour, then turned\nsideways.\n\n\"Be you goin' to stay long, Miss?\"\n\n\"All Summer, I think.\"\n\n\"Do tell!\"\n\nThe young woman smiled in listless amusement, but Joe took it for\nconversational encouragement. \"City folks is dretful bashful when they's\naway from home,\" he said to himself. He clucked again to his unheeding\nhorses, shifted his quid, and was casting about for a new topic when a\nlight broke in upon him.\n\n\"I guess, now, that you're Miss Hathaway's niece, what's come to stay in\nher house while she goes gallivantin' and travellin' in furrin parts, be\nn't you?\"\n\n\"I am Miss Hathaway's niece, and I have never been here before. Where\ndoes she live?\"\n\n\"Up yander.\"\n\nHe flourished the discarded fish-pole which served as a whip, and\npointed out a small white house on the brow of the hill. Reflection\nbrought him the conviction that his remark concerning Miss Hathaway was\na social mistake, since his passenger sat very straight, and asked no\nmore questions.\n\nThe weary wheels creaked, but the collapse which Miss Thorne momentarily\nexpected was mercifully postponed. Being gifted with imagination,\nshe experienced the emotion of a wreck without bodily harm. As in a\nphotograph, she beheld herself suddenly projected into space, followed\nby her suit case, felt her new hat wrenched from her head, and saw\nhopeless gravel stains upon the tailored gown which was the pride of her\nheart. She thought a sprained ankle would be the inevitable outcome of\nthe fall, but was spared the pain of it, for the inability to realise an\nactual hurt is the redeeming feature of imagination.\n\nSuddenly there was a snort of terror from one of the horses, and the\ncarriage stopped abruptly. Ruth clutched her suit case and umbrella,\ninstantly prepared for the worst; but Joe reassured her.\n\n\"Now don't you go and get skeered, Miss,\" he said, kindly; \"'taint\nnothin' in the world but a rabbit. Mamie can't never get used to\nrabbits, someways.\" He indicated one of the horses--a high, raw-boned\nanimal, sketched on a generous plan, whose ribs and joints protruded,\nand whose rough white coat had been weather-worn to grey.\n\n\"Hush now, Mamie,\" he said; \"'taint nothin'.\"\n\n\"Mamie\" looked around inquiringly, with one ear erect and the other at\nan angle. A cataract partially concealed one eye, but in the other was\na world of wickedness and knowledge, modified by a certain lady-like\nreserve.\n\n\"G' long, Mamie!\"\n\nRuth laughed as the horse resumed motion in mincing, maidenly steps.\n\"What's the other one's name?\" she asked.\n\n\"Him? His name's Alfred. Mamie's his mother.\"\n\nMiss Thorne endeavoured to conceal her amusement and Joe was pleased\nbecause the ice was broken. \"I change their names every once in a\nwhile,\" he said, \"'cause it makes some variety, but now I've named'em\nabout all the names I know.\"\n\nThe road wound upward in its own lazy fashion, and there were trees\nat the left, though only one or two shaded the hill itself. As they\napproached the summit, a girl in a blue gingham dress and a neat white\napron came out to meet them.\n\n\"Come right in, Miss Thorne,\" she said, \"and I'll explain it to you.\"\n\nRuth descended, inwardly vowing that she would ride no more in Joe's\ncarriage, and after giving some directions about her trunk, followed her\nguide indoors.\n\nThe storm-beaten house was certainly entitled to the respect accorded to\nage. It was substantial, but unpretentious in outline, and had not been\npainted for a long time. The faded green shutters blended harmoniously\nwith the greyish white background, and the piazza, which was evidently\nan unhappy afterthought of the architect, had two or three new shingles\non its roof.\n\n\"You see it's this way, Miss Thorne,\" the maid began, volubly; \"Miss\nHathaway, she went earlier than she laid out to, on account of the folks\ndecidin' to take a steamer that sailed beforehand--before the other one,\nI mean. She went in sech a hurry that she didn't have time to send you\nword and get an answer, but she's left a letter here for you, for she\ntrusted to your comin'.\"\n\nMiss Thorne laid her hat and jacket aside and settled herself\ncomfortably in a rocker. The maid returned presently with a letter which\nMiss Hathaway had sealed with half an ounce of red wax, presumably in a\nlaudable effort to remove temptation from the path of the red-cheeked,\nwholesome, farmer's daughter who stood near by with her hands on her\nhips.\n\n\"Miss Ruth Thorne,\" the letter began,\n\n\"Dear Niece:\n\n\"I am writing this in a hurry, as we are going a week before we expected\nto. I think you will find everything all right. Hepsey will attend to\nthe house-keeping, for I don't suppose you know much about it, coming\nfrom the city. She's a good-hearted girl, but she's set in her ways, and\nyou'll have to kinder give in to her, but any time when you can't, just\nspeak to her sharp and she'll do as you tell her.\n\n\"I have left money enough for the expenses until I come back, in a\nlittle box on the top shelf of the closet in the front room, under a\npile of blankets and comfortables. The key that unlocks it is hung on\na nail driven into the back of the old bureau in the attic. I believe\nHepsey is honest and reliable, but I don't believe in tempting folks.\n\n\"When I get anywhere where I can, I will write and send you my address,\nand then you can tell me how things are going at home. The catnip is\nhanging from the rafters in the attic, in case you should want some tea,\nand the sassafras is in the little drawer in the bureau that's got the\nkey hanging behind it.\n\n\"If there's anything else you should want, I reckon Hepsey will know\nwhere to find it. Hoping that this will find you enjoying the great\nblessing of good health, I remain,\n\n\"Your Affectionate Aunt,\n\n\"JANE HATHAWAY.\n\n\"P. S. You have to keep a lamp burning every night in the east window of\nthe attic. Be careful that nothing catches afire.\"\n\nThe maid was waiting, in fear and trembling, for she did not know what\ndirections her eccentric mistress might have left.\n\n\"Everything is all right, Hepsey,\" said Miss Thorne, pleasantly, \"and I\nthink you and I will get along nicely. Did Miss Hathaway tell you what\nroom I was to have?\"\n\n\"No'm. She told me you was to make yourself at home. She said you could\nsleep where you pleased.\"\n\n\"Very well, I will go up and see for myself. I would like my tea at six\no'clock.\" She still held the letter in her hand, greatly to the chagrin\nof Hepsey, who was interested in everything and had counted upon a peep\nat it. It was not Miss Hathaway's custom to guard her letters and she\nwas both surprised and disappointed.\n\nAs Ruth climbed the narrow stairway, the quiet, old-fashioned house\nbrought balm to her tired soul. It was exquisitely clean, redolent of\nsweet herbs, and in its atmosphere was a subtle, Puritan restraint.\n\nHave not our houses, mute as they are, their own way of conveying an\nimpression? One may go into a house which has been empty for a long\ntime, and yet feel, instinctively, what sort of people were last\nsheltered there. The silent walls breathe a message to each visitor, and\nas the footfalls echo in the bare cheerless rooms, one discovers where\nSorrow and Trouble had their abode, and where the light, careless\nlaughter of gay Bohemia lingered until dawn. At night, who has not heard\nghostly steps upon the stairs, the soft closing of unseen doors, the\ntapping on a window, and, perchance, a sigh or the sound of tears? Timid\nsouls may shudder and be afraid, but wiser folk smile, with reminiscent\ntenderness, when the old house dreams.\n\nAs she wandered through the tiny, spotless rooms on the second floor of\nMiss Hathaway's house, Ruth had a sense of security and peace which\nshe had never known before. There were two front rooms, of equal size,\nlooking to the west, and she chose the one on the left, because of its\ntwo south windows. There was but one other room, aside from the small\none at the end of the hall, which, as she supposed, was Hepsey's.\n\nOne of the closets was empty, but on a shelf in the other was a\ngreat pile of bedding. She dragged a chair inside, burrowed under the\nblankets, and found a small wooden box, the contents clinking softly as\nshe drew it toward her.\n\nHolding it under her arm, she ascended the narrow, spiral stairs which\nled to the attic. At one end, under the eaves, stood an old mahogany\ndresser. The casters were gone and she moved it with difficulty, but the\nslanting sunbeams of late afternoon revealed the key, which hung, as her\naunt had written, on a nail driven into the back of it.\n\nShe knew, without trying, that it would fit the box, but idly turned the\nlock. As she opened it, a bit of paper fluttered out, and, picking it\nup, she read in her aunt's cramped, But distinct hand: \"Hepsey gets a\ndollar and a half every week. Don't you pay her no more.\"\n\nAs the house was set some distance back, the east window in the attic\nwas the only one which commanded a view of the sea. A small table, with\nits legs sawed off, came exactly to the sill, and here stood a lamp,\nwhich was a lamp simply, without adornment, and held about a pint of\noil.\n\nShe read the letter again and, having mastered its contents, tore it\ninto small pieces, with that urban caution which does not come amiss in\nthe rural districts. She understood that every night of her stay she\nwas to light this lamp with her own hands, but why? The varnish on\nthe table, which had once been glaring, was scratched with innumerable\nrings, where the rough glass had left its mark. Ruth wondered if she\nwere face to face with a mystery.\n\nThe seaward side of the hill was a rocky cliff, and between the\nvegetable garden at the back of the house and the edge of the precipice\nwere a few stumps, well-nigh covered with moss. From her vantage point,\nshe could see the woods which began at the base of the hill, on the\nnorth side, and seemed to end at the sea. On the south, there were a few\ntrees near the cliff, but others near them had been cut down.\n\nStill farther south and below the hill was a grassy plain, through which\na glistening river wound slowly to the ocean. Willows grew along its\nmargin, tipped with silvery green, and with masses of purple twilight\ntangled in the bare branches below.\n\nRuth opened the window and drew a long breath. Her senses had been\ndulled by the years in the city, but childhood, hidden though not\nforgotten, came back as if by magic, with that first scent of sea and\nSpring.\n\nAs yet, she had not fully realised how grateful she was for this little\ntime away from her desk and typewriter. The managing editor had promised\nher the same position, whenever she chose to go back, and there was a\nlittle hoard in the savings-bank, which she would not need to touch,\nowing to the kindness of this eccentric aunt, whom she had never seen.\n\nThe large room was a typical attic, with its spinning-wheel and\ndiscarded furniture--colonial mahogany that would make many a city\nmatron envious, and for which its owner cared little or nothing. There\nwere chests of drawers, two or three battered trunks, a cedar chest, and\ncountless boxes, of various sizes. Bunches of sweet herbs hung from the\nrafters, but there were no cobwebs, because of Miss Hathaway's perfect\nhousekeeping.\n\nRuth regretted the cobwebs and decided not to interfere, should the tiny\nspinners take advantage of Aunt Jane's absence. She found an old chair\nwhich was unsteady on its rockers but not yet depraved enough to betray\none's confidence. Moving it to the window, she sat down and looked out\nat the sea, where the slow boom of the surf came softly from the shore,\nmingled with the liquid melody of returning breakers.\n\nThe first grey of twilight had come upon the world before she thought\nof going downstairs. A match-safe hung upon the window casing, newly\nfilled, and, mindful of her trust, she lighted the lamp and closed the\nwindow. Then a sudden scream from the floor below startled her.\n\n\"Miss Thorne! Miss Thorne!\" cried a shrill voice. \"Come here! Quick!\"\n\nWhite as a sheet, Ruth flew downstairs and met Hepsey in the hall. \"What\non earth is the matter!\" she gasped.\n\n\"Joe's come with your trunk,\" responded that volcanic young woman,\namiably; \"where'd you want it put?\"\n\n\"In the south front room,\" she answered, still frightened, but glad\nnothing more serious had happened. \"You mustn't scream like that.\"\n\n\"Supper's ready,\" resumed Hepsey, nonchalantly, and Ruth followed her\ndown to the little dining-room.\n\nAs she ate, she plied the maid with questions. \"Does Miss Hathaway light\nthat lamp in the attic every night?\"\n\n\"Yes'm. She cleans it and fills it herself, and she puts it out every\nmorning. She don't never let me touch it.\"\n\n\"Why does she keep it there?\"\n\n\"D' know. She d' know, neither.\"\n\n\"Why, Hepsey, what do you mean? Why does she do it if she doesn't know\nwhy she does it?\"\n\n\"D'know.'Cause she wants to, I reckon.\"\n\n\"She's been gone a week, hasn't she?\"\n\n\"No'm. Only six days. It'll be a week to-morrer.\"\n\nHepsey's remarks were short and jerky, as a rule, and had a certain\nexplosive force.\n\n\"Hasn't the lamp been lighted since she went away?\"\n\n\"Yes'm. I was to do it till you come, and after you got here I was to\nask you every night if you'd forgot it.\"\n\nRuth smiled because Aunt Jane's old-fashioned exactness lingered in her\nwake. \"Now see here, Hepsey,\" she began kindly, \"I don't know and you\ndon't know, but I'd like to have you tell me what you think about it.\"\n\n\"I d' know, as you say, mum, but I think--\" here she lowered her\nvoice--\"I think it has something to do with Miss Ainslie.\"\n\n\"Who is Miss Ainslie?\"\n\n\"She's a peculiar woman, Miss Ainslie is,\" the girl explained, smoothing\nher apron, \"and she lives down the road a piece, in the valley as, you\nmay say. She don't never go nowheres, Miss Ainslie don't, but folks goes\nto see her. She's got a funny house--I've been inside of it sometimes\nwhen I've been down on errands for Miss Hathaway. She ain't got no\nfiggered wall paper, nor no lace curtains, and she ain't got no rag\ncarpets neither. Her floors is all kinder funny, and she's got heathen\nthings spread down onto'em. Her house is full of heathen things, and\nsometimes she wears'em.\"\n\n\"Wears what, Hepsey? The 'heathen things' in the house?\"\n\n\"No'm. Other heathen things she's got put away somewheres. She's got\nmoney, I guess, but she's got furniture in her parlour that's just like\nwhat Miss Hathaway's got set away in the attic. We wouldn't use them\nkind of things, nohow,\" she added complacently.\n\n\"Does she live all alone?\"\n\n\"Yes'm. Joe, he does her errands and other folks stops in sometimes, but\nMiss Ainslie ain't left her front yard for I d' know how long. Some says\nshe's cracked, but she's the best housekeeper round here, and if she\nhears of anybody that's sick or in trouble, she allers sends'em things.\nShe ain't never been up here, but Miss Hathaway, she goes down there\nsometimes, and she'n Miss Ainslie swaps cookin' quite regler. I have to\ngo down there with a plate of somethin' Miss Hathaway's made, and Miss\nAinslie allers says: 'Wait just a moment, please, Hepsey, I would like\nto send Miss Hathaway a jar of my preserves.'\"\n\nShe relapsed unconsciously into imitation of Miss Ainslie's speech. In\nthe few words, softened, and betraying a quaint stateliness, Ruth caught\na glimpse of an old-fashioned gentlewoman, reserved and yet gracious.\n\nShe folded her napkin, saying: \"You make the best biscuits I ever\ntasted, Hepsey.\" The girl smiled, but made no reply.\n\n\"What makes you think Miss Ainslie has anything to do with the light?\"\nshe inquired after a little.\n\n\"'Cause there wasn't no light in that winder when I first\ncome--leastways, not as I know of--and after I'd been here a week or so,\nMiss Hathaway, she come back from there one day looking kinder strange.\nShe didn't say much; but the next mornin' she goes down to town and buys\nthat lamp, and she saws off them table legs herself. Every night since,\nthat light's been a-goin', and she puts it out herself every mornin'\nbefore she comes downstairs.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she and Miss Ainslie had been talking of shipwreck, and she\nthought she would have a little lighthouse of her own,\" Miss Thorne\nsuggested, when the silence became oppressive.\n\n\"P'raps so,\" rejoined Hepsey. She had become stolid again.\n\nRuth pushed her chair back and stood at the dining-room window a moment,\nlooking out into the yard. The valley was in shadow, but the last light\nstill lingered on the hill. \"What's that, Hepsey?\" she asked.\n\n\"What's what?\"\n\n\"That--where the evergreen is coming up out of the ground, in the shape\nof a square.\"\n\n\"That's the cat's grave, mum. She died jest afore Miss Hathaway went\naway, and she planted the evergreen.\"\n\n\"I thought something was lacking,\" said Ruth, half to herself.\n\n\"Do you want a kitten, Miss Thorne?\" inquired Hepsey, eagerly. \"I reckon\nI can get you one--Maltese or white, just as you like.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Hepsey; I don't believe I'll import any pets.\"\n\n\"Jest as you say, mum. It's sorter lonesome, though, with no cat; and\nMiss Hathaway said she didn't want no more.\"\n\nSpeculating upon the departed cat's superior charms, that made\nsubstitution seem like sacrilege to Miss Hathaway, Ruth sat down for a\ntime in the old-fashioned parlour, where the shabby haircloth\nfurniture was ornamented with \"tidies\" to the last degree. There was\na marble-topped centre table in the room, and a basket of wax flowers\nunder a glass case, Mrs. Hemans's poems, another book, called The Lady's\nGarland, and the family Bible were carefully arranged upon it.\n\nA hair wreath, also sheltered by glass, hung on the wall near another\ncollection of wax flowers suitably framed. There were various portraits\nof people whom Miss Thorne did not know, though she was a near relative\nof their owner, and two tall, white china vases, decorated with gilt,\nflanked the mantel-shelf. The carpet, which was once of the speaking\nvariety, had faded to the listening point. Coarse lace curtains hung\nfrom brass rings on wooden poles, and red cotton lambrequins were\nfestooned at the top.\n\nHepsey came in to light the lamp that hung by chains over the table,\nbut Miss Thorne rose, saying: \"You needn't mind, Hepsey, as I am going\nupstairs.\"\n\n\"Want me to help you unpack?\" she asked, doubtless wishing for a view of\n\"city clothes.\"\n\n\"No, thank you.\"\n\n\"I put a pitcher of water in your room, Miss Thorne. Is there anything\nelse you would like?\"\n\n\"Nothing more, thank you.\"\n\nShe still lingered, irresolute, shifting from one foot to the other.\n\"Miss Thorne--\" she began hesitatingly.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Be you--be you a lady detective?\" Ruth's clear laughter rang out on the\nevening air. \"Why, no, you foolish girl; I'm a newspaper woman, and I've\nearned a rest--that's all. You mustn't read books with yellow covers.\"\n\nHepsey withdrew, muttering vague apologies, and Ruth found her at the\nhead of the stairs when she went up to her room. \"How long have you been\nwith Miss Hathaway?\" she asked.\n\n\"Five years come next June.\"\n\n\"Good night, Hepsey.\"\n\n\"Good night, Miss Thorne.\"\n\nFrom sheer force of habit, Ruth locked her door. Her trunk was not a\nlarge one, and it did not take her long to put her simple wardrobe into\nthe capacious closet and the dresser drawers. As she moved the empty\ntrunk into the closet, she remembered the box of money that she had\nleft in the attic, and went up to get it. When she returned she heard\nHepsey's door close softly.\n\n\"Silly child,\" she said to herself. \"I might just as well ask her if she\nisn't a'lady detective.' They'll laugh about that in the office when I\ngo back.\"\n\nShe sat down, rocking contentedly, for it was April, and she would not\nhave to go back until Aunt Jane came home, probably about the first of\nOctober. She checked off the free, health-giving months on her tired\nfingers, that would know the blue pencil and the typewriter no more\nuntil Autumn, when she would be strong again and the quivering nerves\nquite steady.\n\nShe blessed the legacy which had fallen into Jane Hathaway's lap and led\nher, at fifty-five, to join a \"personally conducted\" party to the Old\nWorld. Ruth had always had a dim yearning for foreign travel, but just\nnow she felt no latent injustice, such as had often rankled in her soul\nwhen her friends went and she remained at home.\n\nThinking she heard Hepsey in the hall, and not caring to arouse further\nsuspicion, she put out her light and sat by the window, with the\nshutters wide open.\n\nFar down the hill, where the road became level again, and on the left\nas she looked toward the village, was the white house, surrounded by a\ngarden and a hedge, which she supposed was Miss Ainslie's. A timid\nchirp came from the grass, and the faint, sweet smell of growing things\nfloated in through the open window at the other end of the room.\n\nA train from the city sounded a warning whistle as it approached the\nstation, and then a light shone on the grass in front of Miss Ainslie's\nhouse. It was a little gleam, evidently from a candle.\n\n\"So she's keeping a lighthouse, too,\" thought Ruth. The train pulled out\nof the station and half an hour afterward the light disappeared.\n\nShe meditated upon the general subject of illumination while she got\nready for bed, but as soon as her head touched the pillow she lost\nconsciousness and knew no more until the morning light crept into her\nroom.\n\n\n\n\nII. The Attic\n\nThe maid sat in the kitchen, wondering why Miss Thorne did not come\ndown. It was almost seven o'clock, and Miss Hathaway's breakfast hour\nwas half past six. Hepsey did not frame the thought, but she had a vague\nimpression that the guest was lazy.\n\nYet she was grateful for the new interest which had come into\nher monotonous life. Affairs moved like clock work at Miss\nHathaway's--breakfast at half past six, dinner at one, and supper at\nhalf past five. Each day was also set apart by its regular duties, from\nthe washing on Monday to the baking on Saturday.\n\nNow it was possible that there might be a change. Miss Thorne seemed\nfully capable of setting the house topsy-turvy--and Miss Hathaway's last\ninjunction had been: \"Now, Hepsey, you mind Miss Thorne. If I hear that\nyou don't, you'll lose your place.\"\n\nThe young woman who slumbered peacefully upstairs, while the rest of the\nworld was awake, had, from the beginning, aroused admiration in\nHepsey's breast. It was a reluctant, rebellious feeling, mingled with an\nindefinite fear, but it was admiration none the less.\n\nDuring the greater part of a wondering, wakeful night, the excited\nHepsey had seen Miss Thorne as plainly as when she first entered the\nhouse. The tall, straight, graceful figure was familiar by this time,\nand the subdued silken rustle of her skirts was a wonted sound. Ruth's\nface, naturally mobile, had been schooled into a certain reserve, but\nher deep, dark eyes were eloquent, and always would be. Hepsey wondered\nat the opaque whiteness of her skin and the baffling arrangement of her\nhair. The young women of the village had rosy cheeks, but Miss Thorne's\nface was colourless, except for her lips.\n\nIt was very strange, Hepsey thought, for Miss Hathaway to sail before\nher niece came, if, indeed, Miss Thorne was her niece. There was a\nmystery in the house on the hilltop, which she had tried in vain to\nfathom. Foreign letters came frequently, no two of them from the same\nperson, and the lamp in the attic window had burned steadily every night\nfor five years. Otherwise, everything was explainable and sane.\n\nStill, Miss Thorne did not seem even remotely related to her aunt, and\nHepsey had her doubts. Moreover, the guest had an uncanny gift which\namounted to second sight. How did she know that all of Hepsey's books\nhad yellow covers? Miss Hathaway could not have told her in the letter,\nfor the mistress was not awire of her maid's literary tendencies.\n\nIt was half past seven, but no sound came from upstairs. She replenished\nthe fire and resumed meditation. Whatever Miss Thorne might prove to be,\nshe was decidedly interesting. It wis pleasant to watch her, to feel the\nsubtle refinement of all her belongings, and to wonder what was going to\nhappen next. Perhaps Miss Thorne would take her back to the city, as\nher maid, when Miss Hathaway came home, for, in the books, such things\nfrequently happened. Would she go? Hepsey was trying to decide, when\nthere was a light, rapid step on the stairs, a moment's hesitation in\nthe hall, and Miss Thorne came into the dining-room.\n\n\"Good morning, Hepsey,\" she said, cheerily; \"am I late?\"\n\n\"Yes'm. It's goin' on eight, and Miss Hathaway allers has breakfast at\nhalf past six.\"\n\n\"How ghastly,\" Ruth thought. \"I should have told you,\" she said, \"I will\nhave mine at eight.\"\n\n\"Yes'm,\" replied Hepsey, apparently unmoved. \"What time do you want\ndinner?\"\n\n\"At six o'clock--luncheon at half past one.\"\n\nHepsey was puzzled, but in a few moments she understood that dinner was\nto be served at night and supper at midday. Breakfast had already been\nmoved forward an hour and a half, and stranger things might happen at\nany minute.\n\nRuth had several other reforms in mind, but deemed it best to wait.\nAfter breakfast, she remembered the lamp in the window and went up to\nput it out.\n\nIt was still burning when she reached it, though the oil was almost\ngone, and, placing it by the stairway, that she might not forget to have\nit filled, she determined to explore the attic to her heart's content.\n\nThe sunlight streamed through the east window and searched the farthest\ncorners of the room. The floor was bare and worn, but carefully swept,\nand the things that were stored there were huddled together far back\nunder the eaves, as if to make room for others.\n\nIt was not idle curiosity, but delicate sentiment, that made Ruth eager\nto open the trunks and dresser drawers, and to turn over the contents of\nthe boxes that were piled together and covered with dust. The interest\nof the lower part of the house paled in comparison with the first real\nattic she had ever been in.\n\nAfter all, why not? Miss Hathaway was her aunt,--her mother's only\nsister,--and the house was in her care. There was no earthly reason\nwhy she should not amuse herself in her own way. Ruth's instincts were\nagainst it, but Reason triumphed.\n\nThe bunches of dried herbs, hanging from the rafters and swaying back\nand forth in ghostly fashion, gave out a wholesome fragrance, and\nwhen she opened trunks whose lids creaked on their rusty hinges,\ndried rosemary, lavender, and sweet clover filled the room with that\nlong-stored sweetness which is the gracious handmaiden of Memory.\n\nMiss Hathaway was a thrifty soul, but she never stored discarded\nclothing that might be of use to any one, and so Ruth found no\nmoth-eaten garments of bygone pattern, but only things which seemed to\nbe kept for the sake of their tender associations.\n\nThere were letters, on whose yellowed pages the words had long since\nfaded, a dogeared primer, and several well worn schoolbooks, each having\non its fly-leaf: \"Jane Hathaway, Her Book\"; scraps of lace, brocade ard\nrustling taffeta, quilt patterns, needlebooks, and all of the eloquent\ntreasures that a well stored attic can yield.\n\nAs she replaced them, singing softly to herself, a folded newspaper\nslipped to the floor. It was yellow and worn, like the letters, and\nshe unfolded it carefully. It was over thirty years old, and around\na paragraph on the last page a faint line still lingered. It was an\nannouncement of the marriage of Charles G. Winfield, captain of the\nschooner Mary, to Miss Abigail Weatherby.\n\n\"Abigail Weatherby,\" she said aloud. The name had a sweet, old-fashioned\nsound. \"They must have been Aunt Jane's friends.\" She closed the trunk\nand pushed it back to its place, under the eaves.\n\nIn a distant corner was the old cedar chest, heavily carved. She pulled\nit out into the light, her cheeks glowing with quiet happiness, and sat\ndown on the floor beside it. It was evidently Miss Hathaway's treasure\nbox, put away in the attic when spinsterhood was confirmed by the\nfleeting years.\n\nOn top, folded carefully in a sheet, was a gown of white brocade,\nshort-waisted and quaint, trimmed with pearl passementerie. The neck was\nsquare, cut modestly low, and filled in with lace of a delicate, frosty\npattern--Point d'Alencon. Underneath the gown lay piles of lingerie, all\nof the finest linen, daintily made by hand. Some of it was trimmed with\nreal lace, some with crocheted edging, and the rest with hemstitched\nruffles and feather-stitching.\n\nThere was another gown, much worn, of soft blue cashmere, some\nsea-shells, a necklace of uncut turquoises, the colour changed to green,\na prayer-book, a little hymnal, and a bundle of letters, tied with\na faded blue ribbon, which she did not touch. There was but one\npicture--an ambrotype, in an ornate case, of a handsome young man, with\nthat dashing, dare-devil look in his eyes which has ever been attractive\nto women.\n\nRuth smiled as she put the treasures away, thinking that, had Fate\nthrown the dice another way, the young man might have been her esteemed\nand respected uncle. Then, all at once, it came to her that she had\nunthinkingly stumbled upon her aunt's romance.\n\nShe was not a woman to pry into others' secrets, and felt guilty as she\nfled from the attic, taking the lamp with her. Afterward, as she sat on\nthe narrow piazza, basking in the warm Spring sunshine, she pieced out\nthe love affair of Jane Hathaway's early girlhood after her own fashion.\n\nShe could see it all plainly. Aunt Jane had expected to be married\nto the dashing young man and had had her trousseau in readiness, when\nsomething happened. The folded paper would indicate that he was Charles\nWinfield, who had married some one else, but whether Aunt Jane had\nbroken her engagement, or the possible Uncle Charles had simply taken a\nmate without any such formality, was a subject of conjecture.\n\nStill, if the recreant lover had married another, would Aunt Jane have\nkept her treasure chest and her wedding gown? Ruth knew that she herself\nwould not, but she understood that aunts were in a class by themselves.\nIt was possible that Charles Winfield was an earlier lover, and she had\nkept the paper without any special motive, or, perhaps, for \"auld lang\nsyne.\"\n\nProbably the letters would have disclosed the mystery, and the newspaper\ninstinct, on the trail of a \"story,\" was struggling with her sense of\nhonour, but not for the world, now that she knew, would Ruth have read\nthe yellowed pages, which doubtless held faded roses pressed between\nthem.\n\nThe strings of sea-shells, and the larger ones, which could have come\nonly from foreign shores, together with the light in the window, gave\nher a sudden clew. Aunt Jane was waiting for her lover and the lamp was\na signal. If his name was Charles Winfield, the other woman was dead,\nand if not, the marriage notice was that of a friend or an earlier\nlover.\n\nThe explanation was reasonable, clear, and concise--what woman could\nask for more? Yet there was something beyond it which was out of Miss\nThorne's grasp--a tantalising something, which would not be allayed.\nThen she reflected that the Summer was before tier, and, in reality,\nnow that she was off the paper, she had no business with other people's\naffairs.\n\nThe sun was hidden by gathering clouds and the air was damp before Ruth\nmissed the bright warmth on the piazza, and began to walk back and forth\nby way of keeping warm. A gravelled path led to the gate and on either\nside was a row of lilac bushes, the bare stalks tipped with green. A\nwhite picket fence surrounded the yard, except at the back, where the\nedge of the precipice made it useless. The place was small and well\nkept, but there were no flower beds except at the front of the house,\nand there were only two or three trees.\n\nShe walked around the vegetable garden at the back of the house, where\na portion of her Summer sustenance was planted, and discovered an unused\ngate at the side, which swung back and forth, idly, without latching.\nShe was looking over the fence and down the steep hillside, when a sharp\nvoice at her elbow made her jump.\n\n\"Sech as wants dinner can come in and get it,\" announced Hepsey, sourly.\n\"I've yelled and yelled till I've most bust my throat and I ain't\na-goin' to yell no more.\"\n\nShe returned to the house, a picture of offended dignity, but carefully\nleft the door ajar for Ruth, who discovered, upon this rude awakening\nfrom her reverie, that she was very hungry.\n\nIn the afternoon, the chill fog made it impossible to go out, for\nthe wind had risen from the sea and driven the salt mist inland. Miss\nHathaway's library was meagre and uninteresting, Hepsey was busy in the\nkitchen, and Ruth was frankly bored. Reduced at last to the desperate\nstrait of putting all her belongings in irreproachable order, she found\nherself, at four o'clock, without occupation. The temptation in the\nattic wrestled strongly with her, but she would not go.\n\nIt seemed an age until six o'clock. \"This won't do,\" she said to\nherself; \"I'll have to learn how to sew, or crochet, or make tatting. At\nlast, I am to be domesticated. I used to wonder how women had time for\nthe endless fancy work, but I see, now.\"\n\nShe was accustomed to self analysis and introspection, and began to\nconsider what she could get out of the next six months in the way of\ngain. Physical strength, certainly, but what else? The prospect was\ngloomy just then.\n\n\"It's goin' to rain, Miss Thorne,\" said Hepsey, at the door. \"Is all the\nwinders shut?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so,\" she answered.\n\n\"Supper's ready any time you want it.\"\n\n\"Very well, I will come now.\"\n\nWhen she sat down in the parlour, after doing scant justice to Hepsey's\ncooking, it was with a grim resignation, of the Puritan sort which,\nsupposedly, went with the house. There was but one place in all the\nworld where she would like to be, and she was afraid to trust herself in\nthe attic.\n\nBy an elaborate mental process, she convinced herself that the cedar\nchest and the old trunks did not concern her in the least, and tried to\ndevelop a feminine fear of mice, which was not natural to her. She\nhad just placed herself loftily above all mundane things, when Hepsey\nmarched into the room, and placed the attic lamp, newly filled, upon the\nmarble table.\n\nHere was a manifest duty confronting a very superior person and, as she\nwent upstairs, she determined to come back immediately, but when she had\nput the light in the seaward window, she lingered, under the spell of\nthe room.\n\nThe rain beat steadily upon the roof and dripped from the eaves. The\nlight made distorted shadows upon the wall and floor, while the bunches\nof herbs, hanging from the rafters, swung lightly back and forth when\nthe wind rattled the windows and shook the old house.\n\nThe room seemed peopled by the previous generation, that had slept in\nthe massive mahogany bed, rocked in the chairs, with sewing or gossip,\nand stood before the old dresser on tiptoe, peering eagerly into the\nmirror which probably had hung above it. It was as if Memory sat at the\nspinning-wheel, idly twisting the thread, and bringing visions of the\nyears gone by.\n\nA cracked mirror hung against the wall and Ruth saw her reflection\ndimly, as if she, too, belonged to the ghosts of the attic. She was\nnot vain, but she was satisfied with her eyes and hair, her white skin,\nimpervious to tan or burn, and the shape of her mouth. The saucy little\nupward tilt at the end of her nose was a great cross to her, however,\nbecause it was at variance with the dignified bearing which she chose to\nmaintain. As she looked, she wondered, vaguely, if she, like Aunt\nJane, would grow to a loveless old age. It seemed probable, for, at\ntwenty-five, The Prince had not appeared. She had her work and was\nhappy; yet unceasingly, behind those dark eyes, Ruth's soul kept\nmaidenly match for its mate.\n\nWhen she turned to go downstairs, a folded newspaper on the floor\nattracted her attention. It was near one of the trunks which she had\nopened and must have fallen out. She picked it up, to replace it, but it\nproved to be another paper dated a year later than the first one. There\nwas no marked paragraph, but she soon discovered the death notice of\n\"Abigail Winfield, nee Weatherby, aged twenty-two.\" She put it into\nthe trunk out of which she knew it must have fallen, and stood there,\nthinking. Those faded letters, hidden under Aunt Jane's wedding gown,\nwere tempting her with their mute secret as never before. She hesitated,\ntook three steps toward the cedar chest, then fled ingloriously from the\nfield.\n\nWhoever Charles Winfeld was, he was free to love and marry again.\nPerhaps there had been an estrangement and it was he for whom Aunt\nJane was waiting, since sometimes, out of bitterness, the years distil\nforgiveness. She wondered at the nature which was tender enough to keep\nthe wedding gown and the pathetic little treasures, brave enough to keep\nthe paper, with its evidence of falseness, and great enough to forgive.\n\nYet, what right had she to suppose Aunt Jane was waiting? Had she gone\nabroad to seek him and win his recreant heart again? Or was Abigail\nWeatherby her girlhood friend, who had married unhappily, and then died?\n\nSomewhere in Aunt Jane's fifty-five years there was a romance, but,\nafter all, it was not her niece's business. \"I'm an imaginative\ngoose,\" Ruth said to herself. \"I'm asked to keep a light in the window,\npresumably as an incipient lighthouse, and I've found some old clothes\nand two old papers in the attic--that's all--and I've constructed a\ntragedy.\"\n\nShe resolutely put the whole matter aside, as she sat in her room,\nrocking pensively. Her own lamp had not been filled and was burning\ndimly, so she put it out and sat in the darkness, listening to the rain.\n\nShe had not closed the shutters and did not care to lean out in the\nstorm, and so it was that, when the whistle of the ten o'clock train\nsounded hoarsely, she saw the little glimmer of light from Miss\nAinslie's window, making a faint circle in the darkness.\n\nHalf an hour later, as before, it was taken away. The scent of lavender\nand sweet clover clung to Miss Hathaway's linen, and, insensibly\nsoothed, Ruth went to sleep. After hours of dreamless slumber, she\nthought she heard a voice calling her and telling her not to forget the\nlight. It was so real that she started to her feet, half expecting to\nfind some one standing beside her.\n\nThe rain had ceased, and two or three stars, like timid children, were\npeeping at the world from behind the threatening cloud. It was that\nmystical moment which no one may place--the turning of night to day. Far\ndown the hill, ghostly, but not forbidding, was Miss Ainslie's house,\nthe garden around it lying whitely beneath the dews of dawn, and up in\nthe attic window the light still shone, like unfounded hope in a woman's\nsoul, harking across distant seas of misunderstanding and gloom, with\nits pitiful \"All Hail!\"\n\n\n\n\nIII. Miss Ainslie\n\nRuth began to feel a lively interest in her Aunt Jane, and to regret\nthat she had not arrived in time to make her acquaintance. She knew that\nMiss Hathaway was three or four years younger than Mrs. Thorne would\nhave been, had she lived, and that a legacy had recently come to her\nfrom an old friend, but that was all, aside from the discoveries in the\nattic.\n\nShe contemplated the crayon portraits in the parlour and hoped she was\nnot related to any of them. In the family album she found no woman whom\nshe would have liked for an aunt, but was determined to know the worst.\n\n\"Is Miss Hathaway's picture here, Hepsey?\" she asked.\n\n\"No'm. Miss Hathaway, she wouldn't have her picter in the parlour,\nnohow. Some folks does, but Miss Hathaway says't'aint modest.\"\n\n\"I think she's right, Hepsey,\" laughed Ruth, \"though I never thought of\nit in just that way. I'll have to wait until she comes home.\"\n\nIn the afternoon she donned the short skirt and heavy shoes of her\n\"office rig,\" and started down hill to explore the village. It was a\nday to tempt one out of doors,--cool and bright, with that indefinable\ncrispness which belongs to Spring.\n\nThe hill rose sheer from the highlands, which sloped to the river on the\nleft, as she went down, and on the right to the forest. A side path into\nthe woods made her hesitate for a moment, but she went straight on.\n\nIt was the usual small town, which nestles at the foot of a hill and\neventually climbs over it, through the enterprise of its wealthier\nresidents, but, save for Miss Hathaway's house, the enterprise had not,\nas yet, become evident. At the foot of the hill, on the left, was Miss\nAinslie's house and garden, and directly opposite, with the width of the\nhill between them, was a brown house, with a lawn, but no garden except\nthat devoted to vegetables.\n\nAs she walked through the village, stopping to look at the display of\nmerchandise in the window of the single shop, which was also post-office\nand grocery, she attracted a great deal of respectful attention, for,\nin this community, strangers were an event. Ruth reflected that the\nshop had only to grow to about fifty times its present size in order to\nbecome a full-fledged department store and bring upon the town the rank\nand dignity of a metropolis.\n\nWhen she turned her face homeward, she had reached the foot of the hill\nbefore she realised that the first long walk over country roads was hard\nfor one accustomed to city pavements. A broad, flat stone offered\nan inviting resting-place, and she sat down, in the shadow of Miss\nAinslie's hedge, hoping Joe would pass in time to take her to the top\nof the hill. The hedge was high and except for the gate the garden was\nsecluded.\n\n\"I seem to get more tired every minute,\" she thought. \"I wonder if I've\ngot the rheumatism.\"\n\nShe scanned the horizon eagerly for the dilapidated conveyance which she\nhad once both feared and scorned. No sound could have been more welcome\nthan the rumble of those creaking wheels, nor any sight more pleasing\nthan the conflicting expressions in \"Mamie's\" single useful eye. She sat\nthere a long time, waiting for deliverance, but it did not come.\n\n\"I'll get an alpenstock,\" she said to herself, as she rose, wearily, and\ntried to summon courage to start. Then the gate clicked softly and the\nsweetest voice in the world said: \"My dear, you are tired--won't you\ncome in?\"\n\nTurning, she saw Miss Ainslie, smiling graciously. In a moment she had\nexplained that she was Miss Hathaway's niece and that she would be very\nglad to come in for a few moments.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the sweet voice again, \"I know who you are. Your aunt told\nme all about you and I trust we shall be friends.\"\n\nRuth followed her up the gravelled path to the house, and into the\nparlour, where a wood fire blazed cheerily upon the hearth. \"It is\nso damp this time of year,\" she went on, \"that I like to keep my fire\nburning.\"\n\nWhile they were talking, Ruth's eyes rested with pleasure upon her\nhostess. She herself was tall, but Miss Ainslie towered above her. She\nwas a woman of poise and magnificent bearing, and she had the composure\nwhich comes to some as a right and to others with long social training.\n\nHer abundant hair was like spun silver--it was not merely white, but it\nshone. Her skin was as fresh and fair as a girl's, and when she smiled,\none saw that her teeth were white and even; but the great charm of her\nface was her eyes. They were violet, so deep in colour as to seem almost\nblack in certain lights, and behind them lay an indescribable something\nwhich made Ruth love her instinctively. She might have been forty, or\nseventy, but she was beautiful, with the beauty that never fades.\n\nAt intervals, not wishing to stare, Ruth glanced around the room. Having\nonce seen the woman, one could not fail to recognise her house, for\nit suited her. The floors were hardwood, highly polished, and partly\ncovered with rare Oriental rugs. The walls were a soft, dark green,\nbearing no disfiguring design, and the windows were draped with net,\nedged with Duchesse lace. Miss Hathaway's curtains hung straight to the\nfloor, but Miss Ainslie's were tied back with white cord.\n\nThe furniture was colonial mahogany, unspoiled by varnish, and rubbed\nuntil it shone.\n\n\"You have a beautiful home,\" said Ruth, during a pause.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \"I like it.\"\n\n\"You have a great many beautiful things.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered softly, \"they were given to me by a--a friend.\"\n\n\"She must have had a great many,\" observed Ruth, admiring one of the\nrugs.\n\nA delicate pink suffused Miss Ainslie's face. \"My friend,\" she said,\nwith quiet dignity, \"is a seafaring gentleman.\"\n\nThat explained the rugs, Ruth thought, and the vase, of finest\nCloisonne, which stood upon the mantel-shelf. It accounted also for the\nbertha of Mechlin lace, which was fastened to Miss Ainslie's gown, of\nlavender cashmere, by a large amethyst inlaid with gold and surrounded\nby baroque pearls.\n\nFor some little time, they talked of Miss Hathaway and her travels. \"I\ntold her she was too old to go,\" said Miss Ainslie,. smiling, \"but she\nassured me that she could take care of herself, and I think she can.\nEven if she couldn't, she is perfectly safe. These 'personally conducted'\nparties are by far the best, if one goes alone, for the first time.\"\n\nRuth knew that, but she was surprised, nevertheless. \"Won't you tell me\nabout my aunt, Miss Ainslie?\" she asked. \"You know I've never seen her.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, of course I will! Where shall I begin?\"\n\n\"At the beginning,\" answered Ruth, with a little laugh.\n\n\"The beginning is very far away, deary,\" said Miss Ainslie, and Ruth\nfancied she heard a sigh. \"She came here long before I did, and we were\ngirls together. She lived in the old house at the top of the hill, with\nher father and mother, and I lived here with mine. We were very intimate\nfor a long time, and then we had a quarrel, about something that was\nso silly and foolish that I cannot even remember what it was. For five\nyears--no, for almost six, we passed each other like strangers, because\neach was too proud and stubborn to yield. But death, and trouble,\nbrought us together again.\"\n\n\"Who spoke first,\" asked Ruth, much interested, \"you or Aunt Jane?\"\n\n\"It was I, of course. I don't believe she would have done it. She was\nalways stronger than I, and though I can't remember the cause of the\nquarrel, I can feel the hurt to my pride, even at this day.\"\n\n\"I know,\" answered Ruth, quickly, \"something of the same kind once\nhappened to me, only it wasn't pride that held me back--it was just\nplain stubbornness. Sometimes I am conscious of two selves--one of me\nis a nice, polite person that I'm really fond of, and the other is so\ncontrary and so mulish that I'm actually afraid of her. When the two\ncome in conflict, the stubborn one always wins. I'm sorry, but I can't\nhelp it.\"\n\n\"Don't you think we're all like that?\" asked Miss Ainslie, readily\nunderstanding. \"I do not believe any one can have strength of character\nwithout being stubborn. To hold one's position in the face of obstacles,\nand never be tempted to yield--to me, that seems the very foundation.\"\n\n\"Yes, but to be unable to yield when you know you should--that's awful.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" inquired Miss Ainslie, with quiet amusement.\n\n\"Ask Aunt Jane,\" returned Ruth, laughing. \"I begin to perceive our\ndefinite relationship.\"\n\nMiss Ainslie leaned forward to put another maple log on the fire. \"Tell\nme more about Aunt Jane,\" Ruth suggested. \"I'm getting to be somebody's\nrelative, instead of an orphan, stranded on the shore of the world.\"\n\n\"She's hard to analyse,\" began the older woman. \"I have never been\nable to reconcile her firmness with her softness. She's as hard as New\nEngland granite, but I think she wears it like a mask. Sometimes, one\nsees through. She scolds me very often, about anything that occurs to\nher, but I never pay any attention to it. She says I shouldn't live here\nall alone, and that I deserve to have something dreadful happen to me,\nbut she had all the trees cut down that stood on the hill between\nher window and mine, and had a key made to my lower door, and made\nme promise that if I was ill at any time, I would put a signal in my\nwindow--a red shawl in the daytime and a light at night. I hadn't any\nred shawl and she gave me hers.\n\n\"One night--I shall never forget it--I had a terrible attack of\nneuralgia, during the worst storm I have ever known. I didn't even\nknow that I put the light in the window--I was so beside myself with\npain--but she came, at two o'clock in the morning, and stayed with me\nuntil I was all right again. She was so gentle and so tender--I shall\nalways love her for that.\"\n\nThe sweet voice vibrated with feeling, and Ruth's thoughts flew to\nthe light in the attic window, but, no--it could not be seen from Miss\nAinslie's. \"What does Aunt Jane look like?\" she asked, after a pause.\n\n\"I haven't a picture, except one that was taken a long time ago, but\nI'll get that.\" She went upstairs and returned, presently, putting an\nold-fashioned ambrotype into Ruth's hand.\n\nThe velvet-lined case enshrined Aunt Jane in the bloom of her youth. It\nwas a young woman of twenty or twenty-five, seated in a straight-backed\nchair, with her hands encased in black lace mitts and folded in the lap\nof her striped silk gown. The forehead was high, protruding slightly,\nthe eyes rather small, and very dark, the nose straight, and the\nlittle chin exceedingly firm and determined. There was an expression of\nmaidenly wistfulness somewhere, which Ruth could not definitely locate,\nbut there was no hint of it in the chin.\n\n\"Poor little Aunt Jane,\" said Ruth. \"Life never would be easy for her.\"\n\n\"No,\" returned Miss Ainslie, \"but she would not let anyone know.\"\n\nRuth strolled over to the window, thinking that she must be going,\nand Miss Ainslie still held the picture in her hand. \"She had a lover,\ndidn't she?\" asked Ruth, idly.\n\n\"I-I-think so,\" answered the other, unwillingly. \"You remember we\nquarrelled.\"\n\nA young man stopped in the middle of the road, looked at Miss Ainslie's\nhouse, and then at the brown one across the hill. From her position\nin the window, Ruth saw him plainly. He hesitated a moment, then went\ntoward the brown house. She noted that he was a stranger--there was no\nsuch topcoat in the village.\n\n\"Was his name Winfield?\" she asked suddenly, then instantly hated\nherself for the question.\n\nThe ambrotype fell to the floor. Miss Ainslie stooped to pick it up and\nRuth did not see her face. \"Perhaps,\" she said, in a strange tone, \"but\nI never have asked a lady the name of her friend.\"\n\nGentle as it was, Ruth felt the rebuke keenly. An apology was on her\nlips, but only her flushed cheeks betrayed any emotion. Miss Ainslie's\nface was pale, and there was unmistakable resentment in her eyes.\n\n\"I must go,\" Ruth said, after an awkward silence, and in an instant Miss\nAinslie was herself again.\n\n\"No-you mustn't go, deary. You haven't seen my garden yet. I have\nplanted all the seeds and some of them are coming up. Isn't it beautiful\nto see things grow?\"\n\n\"It is indeed,\" Ruth assented, forgetting the momentary awkwardness,\n\"and I have lived for a long time where I have seen nothing grow but car\ntracks and high buildings. May I come again and see your garden?\"\n\n\"I shall be so glad to have you,\" replied Miss Ainslie, with a quaint\nstateliness. \"I have enjoyed your visit so much and I hope you will come\nagain very soon.\"\n\n\"Thank you--I will.\"\n\nHer hostess had opened the door for her, but Ruth stood in the hall,\nwaiting, in obedience to some strange impulse. Then she stepped outside,\nbut something held her back-something that lay unspoken between them.\nThose unfathomable eyes were fixed upon her, questioning, pleading, and\nsearching her inmost soul.\n\nRuth looked at her, wondering, and striving to answer the mute appeal.\nThen Miss Ainslie laid her hand upon her arm. \"My dear,\" she asked,\nearnestly, \"do you light the lamp in the attic window every night?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, Miss Ainslie,\" she answered, quickly.\n\nThe older woman caught her breath, as if in relief, and then the deep\ncrimson flooded her face.\n\n\"Hepsey told me and Aunt Jane left a letter about it,\" Ruth continued,\nhastily, \"and I am very glad to do it. It would be dreadful to have a\nship wrecked, almost at our door.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed Miss Ainslie, her colour receding, \"I have often thought\nof 'those who go down to the sea in ships.' It is so terrible, and\nsometimes, when I hear the surf beating against the cliff, I--I am\nafraid.\"\n\nRuth climbed the hill, interested, happy, yet deeply disturbed. Miss\nAinslie's beautiful, changing face seemed to follow her, and the\nexquisite scent of the lavender, which had filled the rooms, clung to\nher senses like a benediction.\n\nHepsey was right, and unquestionably Miss Ainslie had something to do\nwith the light; but no deep meaning lay behind it--so much was certain.\nShe had lived alone so long that she had grown to have a great fear of\nshipwreck, possibly on account of her friend, the \"seafaring gentleman,\"\nand had asked Miss Hathaway to put the light in the window--that was\nall.\n\nRuth's reason was fully satisfied, but something else was not. \"I'm not\ngoing to think about it any more,\" she said to herself, resolutely, and\nthought she meant it.\n\nShe ate her dinner with the zest of hunger, while Hepsey noiselessly\nserved her. \"I have been to Miss Ainslie's, Hepsey,\" she said at length,\nnot wishing to appear unsociable.\n\nThe maid's clouded visage cleared for an instant. \"Did you find out\nabout the lamp?\" she inquired, eagerly.\n\n\"No, I didn't, Hepsey; but I'll tell you what I think. Miss Ainslie has\nread a great deal and has lived alone so much that she has become very\nmuch afraid of shipwreck. You know all of us have some one fear. For\ninstance, I am terribly afraid of green worms, though a green worm has\nnever harmed me. I think she asked Miss Hathaway to put the lamp in the\nwindow, and possibly told her of something she had read which made her\nfeel that she should have done it before.\"\n\nHepsey's face took on its old, impenetrable calm.\n\n\"Don't you think so?\" asked Miss Thorne, after a long pause.\n\n\"Yes'm.\"\n\n\"It's all very reasonable, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes'm.\"\n\nIn spite of the seeming assent, she knew that Hepsey was not convinced;\nand afterward, when she came into the room with the attic lamp and a box\nof matches, the mystery returned to trouble Ruth again.\n\n\"If I don't take up tatting,\" she thought, as she went upstairs, \"or\nfind something else to do, I'll be a meddling old maid inside of six\nmonths.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV. A Guest\n\nAs the days went by, Ruth had the inevitable reaction. At first the\ncountry brought balm to her tired nerves, and she rested luxuriously,\nbut she had not been at Miss Hathaway's a fortnight before she bitterly\nregretted the step she had taken.\n\nStill there was no going back, for she had given her word, and must stay\nthere until October. The months before her stretched out into a dreary\nwaste. She thought of Miss Ainslie gratefully, as a redeeming feature,\nbut she knew that it was impossible to spend all of her time in the\nhouse--it the foot of the hill.\n\nHalf past six had seemed an unearthly hour for breakfast, and yet more\nthan once Ruth had been downstairs at five o'clock, before Hepsey was\nstiring. There was no rest to be had anywhere, even after a long walk\nthrough the woods and fields. Inaction became irritation, and each\nday was filled with a thousand unbearable annoyances. She was fretful,\nmoody, and restless, always wishing herself back in the office, yet\nknowing that she could not do good work, even if she were there.\n\nShe sat in her room one afternoon, frankly miserable, when Hepsey\nstalked in, unannounced, and gave her a card.\n\n\"Mr. Carl Winfield!\" Ruth repeated aloud. \"Some one to see me, Hepsey?\"\nshe asked, in astonishment.\n\n\"Yes'm. He's a-waitin' on the piazzer.\"\n\n\"Didn't you ask him to come in?\"\n\n\"No'm. Miss Hathaway, she don't want no strangers in her house.\"\n\n\"Go down immediately,\" commanded Ruth, sternly, \"ask him into the\nparlour, and say that Miss Thorne will be down in a few moments.\"\n\n\"Yes'm.\"\n\nHepsey shuffled downstairs with comfortable leisure, opened the door\nwith aggravating slowness, then said, in a harsh tone that reached the\nupper rooms distinctly: \"Miss Thorne, she says that you can come in and\nset in the parlour till she comes down.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" responded a masculine voice, in quiet amusement; \"Miss\nThorne is kind--and generous.\"\n\nRuth's cheeks flushed hotly. \"I don't know whether Miss Thorne will go\ndown or not,\" she said to herself. \"It's probably a book-agent.\"\n\nShe rocked pensively for a minute or two, wondering what would happen if\nshe did not go down. There was no sound from the parlour save a subdued\nclearing of the throat. \"He's getting ready to speak his piece,\" she\nthought, \"and he might as well do it now as to wait for me.\"\n\nThough she loathed Mr. Carl Winfield and his errand, whatever it might\nprove to be, she stopped before her mirror long enough to give a pat\nor two to her rebellious hair. On the way down she determined to be\ndignified, icy, and crushing.\n\nA tall young fellow with a pleasant face rose to greet her as she\nentered the room. \"Miss Thorne?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Yes--please sit down. I am very sorry that my maid should have been so\ninhospitable.\" It was not what she had meant to say.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he replied, easily; \"I quite enjoyed it. I must\nask your pardon for coming to you in this abrupt way, but Carlton gave\nme a letter to you, and I've lost it.\" Carlton was the managing editor,\nand vague expectations of a summons to the office came into Ruth's mind.\n\n\"I'm on The Herald,\" he went on; \"that is, I was, until my eyes gave\nout, and then they didn't want me any more. Newspapers can't use anybody\nout of repair,\" he added, grimly.\n\n\"I know,\" Ruth answered, nodding.\n\n\"Of course the office isn't a sanitarium, though they need that kind\nof an annex; nor yet a literary kindergarten, which I've known it to be\ntaken for, but--well, I won't tell you my troubles. The oculist said I\nmust go to the country for six months, stay outdoors, and neither read\nnor write. I went to see Carlton, and he promised me a berth in the\nFall--they're going to have a morning edition, too, you know.\"\n\nMiss Thorne did not know, but she was much interested.\n\n\"Carlton advised me to come up here,\" resumed Winfield. \"He said you\nwere here, and that you were going back in the Fall. I'm sorry I've lost\nhis letter.\"\n\n\"What was in it?\" inquired Ruth, with a touch of sarcasm. \"You read it,\ndidn't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I read it--that is, I tried to. The thing looked like a\nprescription, but, as nearly as I could make it out, it was principally\na description of the desolation in the office since you left it. At the\nend there was a line or two commending me to your tender mercies, and\nhere I am.\"\n\n\"Commending yourself.\"\n\n\"Now what in the dickens have I done?\" thought Winfield. \"That's it\nexactly, Miss Thorne. I've lost my reference, and I'm doing my best to\ncreate a good impression without it. I thought that as long as we were\ngoing to be on the same paper, and were both exiles--\"\n\nHe paused, and she finished the sentence for him: \"that you'd come to\nsee me. How long have you been in town?\"\n\n\"'In town' is good,\" he said. \"I arrived in this desolate, God-forsaken\nspot just ten days ago. Until now I've hunted and fished every day,\nbut I didn't get anything but a cold. It was very good, of its kind--I\ncouldn't speak above a whisper for three days.\"\n\nShe had already recognised him as the young man she saw standing in the\nroad the day she went to Miss Ainslie's, and mentally asked his\npardon for thinking he was a book-agent. He might become a pleasant\nacquaintance, for he was tall, clean shaven, and well built. His hands\nwere white and shapely and he was well groomed, though not in the least\nfoppish. The troublesome eyes were dark brown, sheltered by a pair of\ntinted glasses. His face was very expressive, responding readily to\nevery change of mood.\n\nThey talked \"shop\" for a time, discovering many mutual friends, and\nRuth liked him. He spoke easily, though hurriedly, and appeared to be\nsomewhat cynical, but she rightly attributed it to restlessness like her\nown.\n\n\"What are you going to do on The Tribune?\" she asked.\n\n\"Anything,\" he answered, with an indefinable shrug. \"'Theirs not to\nreason why, theirs but to do and die.' What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"The same,\" replied Ruth. \"'Society,''Mother's Corner,''Under the\nEvening Lamp,' and 'In the Kitchen with Aunt Jenny.'\"\n\nHe laughed infectiously. \"I wish Carlton could hear you say that.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" returned Ruth, colouring faintly.\n\n\"Why; are you afraid of him?\"\n\n\"Certainly I am. If he speaks to me, I'm instantly stiff with terror.\"\n\n\"Oh, he isn't so bad,\" said Winfield, reassuringly, \"He's naturally\nabrupt, that's all; and I'll venture he doesn't suspect that he has any\ninfluence over you. I'd never fancy that you were afraid of anybody or\nanything on earth.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of anything else,\" she answered, \"except burglars and\ngreen worms.\"\n\n\"Carlton would enjoy the classification--really, Miss Thorne, somebody\nshould tell him, don't you think? So much innocent pleasure doesn't\noften come into the day of a busy man.\"\n\nFor a moment Ruth was angry, and then, all at once, she knew Winfield as\nif he had always been her friend. Conventionality, years, and the veneer\nof society were lightly laid upon one who would always be a boy. Some\nmen are old at twenty, but Winfield would be young at seventy.\n\n\"You can tell him if you want to,\" Ruth rejoined, calmly. \"He'll be so\npleased that he'll double your salary on the spot.\"\n\n\"And you?\" he asked, his eyes twinkling with fun.\n\n\"I'll be pensioned, of course.\"\n\n\"You're all right,\" he returned, \"but I guess I won't tell him. Riches\nlead to temptation, and if I'm going to be on The Tribune I'd hate to\nhave you pensioned.\"\n\nHepsey appeared to have a great deal of employment in the dining-room,\nand was very quiet about it, with long pauses between her leisurely\nmovements. Winfield did not seem to notice it, but it jarred upon Ruth,\nand she was relieved when he said he must go.\n\n\"You'll come again, won't you?\" she asked.\n\n\"I will, indeed.\"\n\nShe stood at the window, unconsciously watching him as he went down\nthe hill with a long, free stride. She liked the strength in his broad\nshoulders, his well modulated voice, and his clear, honest eyes; but\nafter all he was nothing but a boy.\n\n\"Miss Thorne,\" said Hepsey, at her elbow, \"is that your beau?\" It\nwas not impertinence, but sheer friendly interest which could not be\nmistaken for anything else.\n\n\"No,\" she answered; \"of course not.\"\n\n\"He's real nice-lookin', ain't he?\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you got your eye on anybody else?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then, Miss Thorne, I don't know's you could do better.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not.\" She was thinking, and spoke mechanically. From where she\nstood she could still see him walking rapidly down the hill.\n\n\"Ain't you never seen him before?\"\n\nMiss Thorne turned. \"Hepsey,\" she said, coldly, \"please go into the\nkitchen and attend to your work. And the next time I have company,\nplease stay in the kitchen--not in the dining-room.\"\n\n\"Yes'm,\" replied Hepsey, meekly, hastening to obey.\n\nShe was not subtle, but she understood that in some way she had offended\nMiss Thorne, and racked her brain vainly. She had said nothing that\nshe would not have said to Miss Hathaway, and had intended nothing but\nfriendliness. As for her being in the dining-room--why, very often, when\nMiss Hathaway had company, she was called in to give her version of\nsome bit of village gossip. Miss Hathaway scolded her when she was\ndispleased, but never before had any one spoken to Hepsey in a measured,\nicy tone that was at once lady-like and commanding. Tears came into her\neyes, for she was sensitive, after all.\n\nA step sounded overhead, and Hepsey regained her self-possession. She\nhad heard nearly all of the conversation and could have told Miss Thorne\na great deal about the young man. For instance, he had not said that he\nwas boarding at Joe's, across the road from Miss Ainslie's, and that\nhe intended to stay all Summer. She could have told her of an uncertain\ntemper, peculiar tastes, and of a silver shaving-cup which Joe had\npromised her a glimpse of before the visitor went back to the city; but\nshe decided to let Miss Thorne go on in her blind ignorance.\n\nRuth, meanwhile, was meditating, with an aggravated restlessness. The\nmomentary glimpse of the outer world had stung her into a sense of\nher isolation, which she realised even more keenly than before. It was\nbecause of this, she told herself, that she hoped Winfield liked her,\nfor it was not her wont to care about such trifles. He thought of her,\nidly, as a nice girl, who was rather pretty when she was interested in\nanything; but, with a woman's insight, influenced insensibly by Hepsey's\ncomment, Ruth scented possibilities.\n\nShe wanted him to like her, to stay in that miserable village as long as\nshe did, and keep her mind from stagnation--her thought went no further\nthan that. In October, when they went back, she would thank Carlton,\nprettily, for sending her a friend--provided they did not quarrel. She\ncould see long days of intimate companionship, of that exalted kind\nwhich is, possible only when man and woman meet on a high plane. \"We're\nboth too old for nonsense,\" she thought; and then a sudden fear struck\nher, that Winfield might be several years younger than she was.\n\nImmediately she despised herself. \"I don't care if he is,\" she thought,\nwith her cheeks crimson; \"it's nothing to me. He's a nice boy, and I\nwant to be amused.\"\n\nShe went to her dresser, took out the large top drawer, and dumped its\ncontents on the bed. It was a desperate measure, for Ruth hated to put\nthings in order. The newspaper which had lain in the bottom of it had\nfallen out also, and she shook it so violently that she tore it.\n\nThen ribbons, handkerchiefs, stocks, gloves, and collars were\nunceremoniously hustled back into the drawer, for Miss Thorne was at\nodds with herself and the world. She was angry with Hepsey, she hated\nWinfield, and despised herself. She picked up a scrap of paper which lay\non a glove, and caught a glimpse of unfamiliar penmanship.\n\nIt was apparently the end of a letter, and the rest of it was gone. \"At\nGibraltar for some time,\" she read, \"keeping a shop, but will probably\nbe found now in some small town on the coast of Italy. Very truly\nyours.\" The signature had been torn off.\n\n\"Why, that isn't mine,\" she thought. \"It must be something of Aunt\nJane's.\" Another bit of paper lay near it, and, unthinkingly, she read a\nletter which was not meant for her.\n\n\"I thank you from my heart,\" it began, \"for understanding me. I could\nnot put it into words, but I believe you know. Perhaps you think it is\nuseless--that it is too late; but if it was, I would know. You have been\nvery kind, and I thank you.\"\n\n There was neither date, address, nor signature. The message\nstood alone, as absolutely as some far-off star whose light could not\nbe seen from the earth. Some one understood it--two understood it--the\nwriter and Aunt Jane.\n\nRuth put it back under the paper, with the scrap of the other letter,\nand closed the drawer with a bang. \"I hope,\" she said to herself, \"that\nwhile I stay here I'll be mercifully preserved from finding things that\nare none of my business.\" Then, as in a lightning flash, for an instant\nshe saw clearly.\n\nFate plays us many tricks and assumes strange forms, but Ruth knew that\nsome day, on that New England hill, she would come face to face with a\ndestiny that had been ordained from the beginning. Something waited for\nher there--some great change. She trembled at the thought, but was not\nafraid.\n\n\n\n\nV. The Rumours of the Valley\n\n\"Miss Thorne,\" said Hepsey, from the doorway of Ruth's room, \"that\nfeller's here again.\" There was an unconscious emphasis on the last\nword, and Ruth herself was somewhat surprised, for she had not expected\nanother call so soon.\n\n\"He's a-settin' 'n in the parlour,\" continued Hepsey, \"when he ain't\na-walkin' around it and wearin' out the carpet. I didn't come up when\nhe first come, on account of my pie crust bein' all ready to put in the\noven.\"\n\n\"How long has he been here?\" asked Ruth, dabbing a bit of powder on her\nnose and selecting a fresh collar.\n\n\"Oh, p'raps half an hour.\"\n\n\"That isn't right, Hepsey; when anyone comes you must tell me\nimmediately. Never mind the pie crust next time.\" Ruth endeavoured to\nspeak kindly, but she was irritated at the necessity of making another\napology.\n\nWhen she went down, Winfield dismissed her excuses with a comprehensive\nwave of the hand. \"I always have to wait when I go to call on a girl,\"\nhe said; \"it's one of the most charming vagaries of the ever-feminine. I\nused to think that perhaps I wasn't popular, but every fellow I know has\nthe same experience.\"\n\n\"I'm an exception,\" explained Ruth; \"I never keep any one waiting. Of\nmy own volition, that is,\" she added, hastily, feeling his unspoken\ncomment.\n\n\"I came up this afternoon to ask a favour of you,\" he began. \"Won't you\ngo for a walk with me? It's wrong to stay indoors on a day like this.\"\n\n\"Wait till I get my hat,\" said Ruth, rising.\n\n\"Fifteen minutes is the limit,\" he called to her, as she went upstairs.\n\nShe was back again almost immediately, and Hepsey watched them in\nwide-mouthed astonishment as they went down hill together, for it was\nnot in her code of manners that \"walking out\" should begin so soon. When\nthey approached Miss Ainslie's he pointed out the brown house across\nfrom it, on the other side of the hill.\n\n\"Yonder palatial mansion is my present lodging,\" he volunteered, \"and I\nam a helpless fly in the web of the 'Widder' Pendleton.\"\n\n\"Pendleton,\" repeated Ruth; \"why, that's Joe's name.\"\n\n\"It is,\" returned Winfield, concisely. \"He sits opposite me at the\ntable, and wonders at my use of a fork. It is considered merely a spear\nfor bread and meat at the 'Widder's.' I am observed closely at all\ntimes, and in some respects Joe admires me enough to attempt imitation,\nwhich, as you know, is the highest form of flattery. For instance, this\nmorning he wore not only a collar and tie, but a scarf pin. It was\na string tie, and I've never before seen a pin worn in one, but it's\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"It must be.\"\n\n\"He has a sweetheart,\" Winfield went on, \"and I expect she'll be\ndazzled.\"\n\n\"My Hepsey is his lady love,\" Ruth explained.\n\n\"What? The haughty damsel who wouldn't let me in? Do tell!\"\n\n\"You're imitating now,\" laughed Ruth, \"but I shouldn't call it\nflattery.\"\n\nFor a moment, there was a chilly silence. Ruth did not look at him, but\nshe bit her lip and then laughed, unwillingly. \"'It's all true,\" she\nsaid, \"I plead guilty.\"\n\n\"You see, I know all about you,\" he went on. \"You knit your brows in\ndeep thought, do not hear when you are spoken to, even in a loud voice,\nand your mail consists almost entirely of bulky envelopes, of a legal\nnature, such as came to the 'Widder' Pendleton from the insurance\npeople.\"\n\n\"Returned manuscripts,\" she interjected.\n\n\"Possibly--far be it from me to say they're not. Why, I've had 'em\nmyself.\"\n\n\"You don't mean it!\" she exclaimed, ironically.\n\n\"You seek out, as if by instinct, the only crazy person in the village,\nand come home greatly perturbed. You ask queer questions of your humble\nserving-maid, assume a skirt which is shorter than the approved model,\nspeaking from the village standpoint, and unhesitatingly appear on\nthe public streets. You go to the attic at night and search the inmost\nrecesses of many old trunks.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed Ruth, \"I've done all that.\"\n\n\"At breakfast you refuse pie, and complain because the coffee is boiled.\nDid anybody ever hear of coffee that wasn't boiled? Is it eaten raw\nin the city? You call supper 'dinner,' and have been known to seek\nnourishment at nine o'clock at night, when all respectable people are\nsound asleep. In your trunk, you have vainly attempted to conceal a\nlarge metal object, the use of which is unknown.\"\n\n\"Oh, my hapless chafing-dish!\" groaned Ruth.\n\n\"Chafing-dish?\" repeated Winfield, brightening visibly. \"And I eating\nsole leather and fried potatoes? From this hour I am your slave--you\ncan't lose me now!\n\n\"Go on,\" she commanded.\n\n\"I can't--the flow of my eloquence is stopped by rapturous anticipation.\nSuffice it to say that the people of this enterprising city are well up\nin the ways of the wicked world, for the storekeeper takes The New York\nWeekly and the 'Widder' Pendleton subscribes for The Fireside Companion.\nThe back numbers, which are not worn out, are the circulating library of\nthe village. It's no use, Miss Thorne--you might stand on your hilltop\nand proclaim your innocence until you were hoarse, and it would be\nutterly without effect. Your status is definitely settled.\"\n\n\"How about Aunt Jane?\" she inquired. \"Does my relationship count for\nnaught?\"\n\n\"Now you are rapidly approaching the centre of things,\" replied the\nyoung man. \"Miss Hathaway is one woman in a thousand, though somewhat\neccentric. She is the venerated pillar of the community and a constant\nattendant it church, which it seems you are not. Also, if you are really\nher niece, where is the family resemblance? Why has she never spoken\nof you? Why have you never been here before? Why are her letters to you\nsealed with red wax, bought especially for the purpose? Why does she go\naway before you come? Lady Gwendolen Hetherington,\" he demanded, with\nmelodramatic fervour, \"answer me these things if you can!\"\n\n\"I'm tired,\" she complained.\n\n\"Delicate compliment,\" observed Winfield, apparently to himself. \"Here's\na log across our path, Miss Thorne; let's sit down.\"\n\nThe budded maples arched over the narrow path, and a wild canary,\nsinging in the sun, hopped from bough to bough. A robin's cheery chirp\ncame from another tree, and the clear notes of a thrush, with a mottled\nbreast, were answered by another in the gold-green aisles beyond.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, under his breath, \"isn't this great!\"\n\nThe exquisite peace of the forest was like that of another sphere.\n\"Yes,\" she answered, softly, \"it is beautiful.\"\n\n\"You're evading the original subject,\" he suggested, a little later.\n\n\"I haven't had a chance to talk,\" she explained. \"You've done a\nmonologue ever since we left the house, and I listened, as becomes\ninferior and subordinate woman. I have never seen my venerated\nkinswoman, and I don't see how she happened to think of me.\nNevertheless, when she wrote, asking me to take charge of her house\nwhile she went to Europe, I gladly consented, sight unseen. When I\ncame, she was gone. I do not deny the short skirt and heavy shoes, the\ncriticism of boiled coffee, nor the disdain of breakfast pie. As far is\nI know, Aunt Jane is my only living relative.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" he said, cheerfully; \"I'm shy even of an aunt. Why\nshouldn't the orphans console one another?\"\n\n\"They should,\" admitted Ruth; \"and you are doing your share nobly.\"\n\n\"Permit me to return the compliment. Honestly, Miss Thorne,\" he\ncontinued, seriously, \"you have no idea how much I appreciate your being\nhere. When I first realised what it meant to be deprived of books and\npapers for six months at a stretch, it seemed as if I should go mad.\nStill, I suppose six months isn't as bad as forever, and I was given\na choice. I don't want to bore you, but if you will let me come\noccasionally, I shall be very glad. I'm going to try to be patient, too,\nif you'll help me--patience isn't my long suit.\"\n\n\"Indeed I will help you,\" answered Ruth, impulsively; \"I know how hard\nit must be.\"\n\n\"I'm not begging for your sympathy, though I assure you it is welcome.\"\nHe polished the tinted glasses with a bit of chamois.. and his eyes\nfilled with the mist of weakness before he put them on again. \"So you've\nnever seen your aunt,\" he said.\n\n\"No--that pleasure is still in store for me.\"\n\n\"They say down at the 'Widder's' that she's a woman with a romance.\"\n\n\"Tell me about it!\" exclaimed Ruth, eagerly.\n\n\"Little girls mustn't ask questions,\" he remarked, patronisingly, and\nin his most irritating manner. \"Besides, I don't know. If the 'Widder'\nknows, she won't tell, so it's fair to suppose she doesn't. Your\nrelation does queer things in the attic, and every Spring, she has an\nannual weep. I suppose it's the house cleaning, for the rest of the year\nshe's dry-eyed and calm.\"\n\n\"I weep very frequently,\" commented Ruth.\n\n\"'Tears, idle tears--I wonder what they mean.'\"\n\n\"They don't mean much, in the case of a woman.\"\n\n\"I've never seen many of'em,\" returned Winfield, \"and I don't want to.\nEven stage tears go against the grain with me. I know that the lady who\nsobs behind the footlights is well paid for it, but all the same, it\ngives me the creeps.\"\n\n\"It's nothing serious--really it isn't,\" she explained. \"It's merely a\nsafety valve. If women couldn't cry, they'd explode.\"\n\n\"I always supposed tears were signs of sorrow,\" he said.\n\n\"Far from it,\" laughed Ruth. \"When I get very angry, I cry, and then I\ngot angrier because I'm crying and cry harder.\"\n\n\"That opens up a fearful possibility. What would happen if you kept\ngetting angrier because you were crying and crying harder because you\ngot angrier?\"\n\n\"I have no idea,\" she answered, with her dark eyes fixed upon him, \"but\nit's a promising field for investigation.\"'\n\n\"I don't want to see the experiment.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said Ruth, laconically, \"you won't.\"\n\nThere was a long silence, and Winfield began to draw designs on the bare\nearth with a twig. \"Tell me about the lady who is considered crazy,\" he\nsuggested.\n\nRuth briefly described Miss Ainslie, dwelling lovingly upon her beauty\nand charm. He listened indifferently at first, but when she told him\nof the rugs, the real lace which edged the curtains, and the Cloisonne\nvase, he became much interested.\n\n\"Take me to see her some day, won't you,\" he asked, carelessly.\n\nRuth's eyes met his squarely. \"'T isn't a 'story,'\" she said,\nresentfully, forgetting her own temptation.\n\nThe dull colour flooded his face. \"You forget, Miss Thorne, that I am\nforbidden to read or write.\"\n\n\"For six months only,\" answered Ruth, sternly, \"and there's always a\nplace for a good Sunday special.\"\n\nHe changed the subject, but there were frequent awkward pauses and the\nspontaniety was gone. She rose, adjusting her belt in the back, and\nannounced that it was time for her to go home.\n\nOn their way up the hill, she tried to be gracious enough to atone\nfor her rudeness, but, though he was politeness itself, there was a\ndifference, and she felt as if she had lost something. Distance lay\nbetween them--a cold, immeasurable distance, yet she knew that she had\ndone right.\n\nHe opened the gate for her, then turned to go. \"Won't you come in?\" she\nasked, conventionally.\n\n\"No, thank you--some other time, if I may. I've had a charming\nafternoon.\" He smiled pleasantly, and was off down the hill.\n\nWhen she remembered that it was a Winfield who had married Abigail\nWeatherby, she dismissed the matter as mere coincidence, and determined,\nat all costs, to shield Miss Ainslie. The vision of that gracious lady\ncame to her, bringing with it a certain uplift of soul. Instantly, she\nwas placed far above the petty concerns of earth, like one who walks\nupon the heights, untroubled, while restless surges thunder at his feet.\n\n\n\n\nVI. The Garden\n\nMiss Thorne wrote an apology to Winfield, and then tore it up, thereby\ngaining comparative peace of mind, for, with some natures, expression\nis the main thing, and direction is but secondary. She was not surprised\nbecause he did not come; on the contrary, she had rather expected to be\nleft to her own devices for a time, but one afternoon she dressed with\nunusual care and sat in state in the parlour, vaguely expectant. If he\nintended to be friendly, it was certainly time for him to come again.\n\nHepsey, passing through the hall, noted the crisp white ribbon at\nher throat and the bow in her hair. \"Are you expectin' company, Miss\nThorne?\" she asked, innocently.\n\n\"I am expecting no one,\" answered Ruth, frigidly, \"I am going out.\"\n\nFeeling obliged to make her word good, she took the path which led to\nMiss Ainslie's. As she entered the gate, she had a glimpse of Winfield,\nsitting by the front window of Mrs. Pendleton's brown house, in such\na dejected attitude that she pitied him. She considered the virtuous\nemotion very praiseworthy, even though it was not deep enough for her to\nbestow a cheery nod upon the gloomy person across the way.\n\nMiss Ainslie was unaffectedly glad to see her, and Ruth sank into an\neasy chair with something like content. The atmosphere of the place\nwas insensibly soothing and she instantly felt a subtle change. Miss\nAinslie, as always, wore a lavender gown, with real lace at the throat\nand wrists. Her white hair was waved softly and on the third finger of\nher left hand was a ring of Roman gold, set with an amethyst and two\nlarge pearls.\n\nThere was a beautiful serenity about her, evident in every line of\nher face and figure. Time had dealt gently with her, and except on her\nqueenly head had left no trace of his passing. The delicate scent of\nthe lavender floated from her gown and her laces, almost as if it were\na part of her, and brought visions of an old-time garden, whose gentle\nmistress was ever tranquil and content. As she sat there, smiling, she\nmight have been Peace grown old.\n\n\"Miss Ainslie,\" said Ruth, suddenly, \"have you ever had any trouble?\"\n\nA shadow crossed her face, and then she answered, patiently, \"Why,\nyes--I've had my share.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to be personal,\" Ruth explained, \"I was just thinking.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said the other, gently. Then, after a little, she spoke\nagain:\n\n\"We all have trouble, deary--it's part of life; but I believe that we\nall share equally in the joy of the world. Allowing for temperament,\nI mean. Sorrows that would crush some are lightly borne by others, and\nsome have the gift of finding great happiness in little things.\n\n\"Then, too, we never have any more than we can bear--nothing that has\nnot been borne before, and bravely at that. There isn't a new sorrow in\nthe world--they're all old ones--but we can all find new happiness if we\nlook in the right way.\"\n\nThe voice had a full music, instinct with tenderness, and gradually\nRuth's troubled spirit was eased. \"I don't know what's the matter with\nme,\" she said, meditatively, \"for I'm not morbid, and I don't have the\nblues very often, but almost ever since I've been at Aunt Jane's, I've\nbeen restless and disturbed. I know there's no reason for it, but I\ncan't help it.\"\n\n\"Don't you think that it's because you have nothing to do? You've always\nbeen so busy, and you aren't used to idleness.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so. I miss my work, but at the same time, I haven't sense\nenough to do it.\"\n\n\"Poor child, you're tired--too tired to rest.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am tired,\" answered Ruth, the tears of nervous weakness coming\ninto her eyes.\n\n\"Come out into the garden.\"\n\nMiss Ainslie drew a fleecy shawl over her shoulders and led her guest\noutdoors. Though she kept pace with the world in many other ways, it\nwas an old-fashioned garden, with a sun-dial and an arbour, and little\npaths, nicely kept, that led to the flower beds and circled around them.\nThere were no flowers as yet, except in a bed of wild violets under\na bay window, but tiny sprigs of green were everywhere eloquent with\npromise, and the lilacs were budded.\n\n\"That's a snowball bush over there,\" said Miss Ainslie, \"and all\nthat corner of the garden will be full of roses in June. They're\nold-fashioned roses, that I expect you wouldn't care for-blush and\ncinnamon and sweet briar--but I love them all. That long row is half\npeonies and half bleeding-hearts, and I have a bed of columbines under a\nwindow on the other side of the house. The mignonette and forget-me-nots\nhave a place to themselves, for I think they belong together--sweetness\nand memory.\n\n\"There's going to be lady-slippers over there,\" Miss Ainslie went on,\n\"and sweet william. The porch is always covered with morning-glories--I\nthink they're beautiful and in that large bed I've planted poppies,\nsnap-dragon, and marigolds. This round one is full of larkspur and\nbachelor's buttons. I have phlox and petunias, too--did you ever see a\npetunia seed?\"\n\nRuth shook her head.\n\n\"It's the tiniest thing, smaller than a grain of sand. When I plant\nthem, I always wonder how those great, feathery petunias are coming out\nof those little, baby seeds, but they come. Over there are things that\nwon't blossom till late--asters, tiger-lilies and prince's feather. It's\ngoing to be a beautiful garden, deary. Down by the gate are my sweet\nherbs and simples--marjoram, sweet thyme, rosemary, and lavender. I love\nthe lavender, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" replied Ruth, \"but I've never seen it growing.\"\n\n\"It's a little bush, with lavender flowers that yield honey, and it's\nall sweet--flowers, leaves, and all. I expect you'll laugh at me, but\nI've planted sunflowers and four-o'clocks and foxglove.\"\n\n\"I won't laugh---I think it's lovely. What do you like best, Miss\nAinslie?\"\n\n\"I love them all,\" she said, with a smile on her lips and her deep,\nunfathomable eyes fixed upon Ruth, \"but I think the lavender comes\nfirst. It's so sweet, and then it has associations--\"\n\nShe paused, in confusion, and Ruth went on, quickly: \"I think they\nall have associations, and that's why we love them. I can't bear red\ngeraniums because a cross old woman I knew when I was a child had her\nyard full of them, and I shall always love the lavender,\" she added,\nsoftly, \"because it makes me think of you.\"\n\nMiss Ainslie's checks flushed and her eyes shone. \"Now we'll go into the\nhouse,\" she said, \"and we'll have tea.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't stay any longer,\" murmured Ruth, following her, \"I've been\nhere so long now.\"\n\n\"'T isn't long,\" contradicted Miss Ainslie, sweetly, \"it's been only a\nvery few minutes.\"\n\nEvery moment, the house and its owner took on new beauty and charm. Miss\nAinslie spread a napkin of finest damask upon the little mahogany tea\ntable, then brought in a silver teapot of quaint design, and two cups of\nJapanese china, dainty to the point of fragility.\n\n\"Why, Miss Ainslie,\" exclaimed Ruth, in surprise, \"where did you get\nRoyal Kaga?\"\n\nMiss Ainslie was bending over the table, and the white hand that held\nthe teapot trembled a little. \"They were a present from--a friend,\" she\nanswered, in a low voice.\n\n\"They're beautiful,\" said Ruth, hurriedly.\n\nShe had been to many an elaborate affair, which was down on the social\ncalendar as a \"tea,\" sometimes as reporter and often as guest, but she\nhad found no hostess like Miss Ainslie, no china so exquisitely fine,\nnor any tea like the clear, fragrant amber which was poured into her\ncup.\n\n\"It came from China,\" said Miss Ainslie, feeling the unspoken question.\n\"I had a whole chest of it, but it's almost all gone.\"\n\nRuth was turning her cup and consulting the oracle. \"Here's two people,\na man and a woman, from a great distance, and, yes, here's money, too.\nWhat is there in yours?\"\n\n\"Nothing, deary, and besides, it doesn't come true.\"\n\nWhen Ruth finally aroused herself to go home, the old restlessness, for\nthe moment, was gone. \"There's a charm about you,\" she said, \"for I feel\nas if I could sleep a whole week and never wake at all.\"\n\n\"It's the tea,\" smiled Miss Ainslie, \"for I'm a very commonplace body.\"\n\n\"You, commonplace?\" repeated Ruth; \"why, there's nobody like you!\"\n\nThey stood at the door a few moments, talking aimlessly, but Ruth was\nwatching Miss Ainslie's face, as the sunset light lay caressingly upon\nit. \"I've had a lovely time,\" she said, taking another step toward the\ngate.\n\n\"So have I--you'll come again, won't you?\" The sweet voice was pleading\nnow, and Ruth answered it in her inmost soul. Impulsively, she came\nback, threw her arms around Miss Ainslie's neck, and kissed her. \"I love\nyou,\" she said, \"don't you know I do?\"\n\nThe quick tears filled Miss Ainslie's eyes and she smiled through the\nmist. \"Thank you, deary,\" she whispered, \"it's a long time since any one\nhas kissed me--a long time!\"\n\nRuth turned back at the gate, to wave her hand, and even at that\ndistance, saw that Miss Ainslie was very pale.\n\n\nWinfield was waiting for her, just outside the hedge, but his presence\njarred upon her strangely, and her salutation was not cordial.\n\n\"Is the lady a friend of yours?\" he inquired, indifferently.\n\n\"She is,\" returned Ruth; \"I don't go to see my enemies--do you?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether I do or not,\" he said, looking at her\nsignificantly.\n\nHer colour rose, but she replied, sharply: \"For the sake of peace, let\nus assume that you do not.\"\n\n\"Miss Thorne,\" he began, as they climbed the hill, \"I don't see why you\ndon't apply something cooling to your feverish temper. You have to live\nwith yourself all the time, you know, and, occasionally, it must be\nvery difficult. A rag, now, wet in cold water, and tied around your\nneck--have you ever tried that? It's said to be very good.\"\n\n\"I have one on now,\" she answered, with apparent seriousness, \"only you\ncan't see it under my ribbon. It's getting dry and I think I'd better\nhurry home to wet it again, don't you?\"\n\nWinfield laughed joyously. \"You'll do,\" he said.\n\nBefore they were half up the hill, they were on good terms again. \"I\ndon't want to go home, do you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Home? I have no home--I'm only a poor working girl.\"\n\n\"Oh, what would this be with music! I can see it now! Ladies and\ngentlemen, with your kind permission, I will endeavour to give you a\nlittle song of my own composition, entitled:'Why Has the Working Girl No\nHome!'\"\n\n\"You haven't my permission, and you're a wretch.\"\n\n\"I am,\" he admitted, cheerfully, \"moreover, I'm a worm in the dust.\"\n\n\"I don't like worms.\"\n\n\"Then you'll have to learn.\"\n\nRuth resented his calm assumption of mastery. \"You're dreadfully young,\"\nshe said; \"do you think you'll ever grow up?\"\n\n\"Huh!\" returned Winfield, boyishly, \"I'm most thirty.\"\n\n\"Really? I shouldn't have thought you were of age.\"\n\n\"Here's a side path, Miss Thorne,\" he said, abruptly, \"that seems to\ngo down into the woods. Shall we explore? It won't be dark for an hour\nyet.\"\n\nThey descended with some difficulty, since the way was not cleat, and\ncame into the woods at a point not far from the log across the path. \"We\nmustn't sit there any more,\" he observed, \"or we'll fight. That's where\nwe were the other day, when you attempted to assassinate me.\"\n\n\"I didn't!\" exclaimed Ruth indignantly.\n\n\"That rag does seem to be pretty dry,\" he said, apparently to himself.\n\"Perhaps, when we get to the sad sea, we can wet it, and so insure\ncomparative calm.\"\n\nShe laughed, reluctantly. The path led around the hill and down from the\nhighlands to a narrow ledge of beach that lay under the cliff. \"Do you\nwant to drown me?\" she asked. \"It looks very much as if you intended to,\nfor this ledge is covered at high tide.\"\n\n\"You wrong me, Miss Thorne; I have never drowned anything.\"\n\nHis answer was lost upon her, for she stood on the beach, under the\ncliff, looking at the water. The shimmering turquoise blue was slowly\nchanging to grey, and a single sea gull circled overhead.\n\nHe made two or three observations, to which Ruth paid no attention.\n\"My Lady Disdain,\" he said, with assumed anxiety, \"don't you think we'd\nbetter go on? I don't know what time the tide comes in, and I never\ncould look your aunt in the face if I had drowned her only relative.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she replied carelessly, \"let's go around the other way.\"\n\nThey followed the beach until they came to the other side of the hill,\nbut found no path leading back to civilisation, though the ascent could\neasily be made.\n\n\"People have been here before,\" he said; \"here are some initials cut\ninto this stone. What are they? I can't see.\"\n\nRuth stooped to look at the granite boulder he indicated. \"J. H.,\" she\nanswered, \"and J. B.\"\n\n\"It's incomplete,\" he objected; \"there should be a heart with an arrow\nrun through it.\"\n\n\"You can fix it to suit yourself,\" Ruth returned, coolly, \"I don't think\nanybody will mind.\" She did not hear his reply, for it suddenly dawned\nupon her that \"J. H.\" meant Jane Hathaway.\n\nThey stood there in the twilight for some little time, watching the\nchanging colours on the horizon and then there was a faint glow on the\nwater from the cliff above. Ruth went out far enough to see that Hepsey\nhad placed the lamp in the attic window.\n\n\"It's time to go,\" she said, \"inasmuch as we have to go back the way we\ncame.\"\n\nThey crossed to the other side and went back through the woods. It was\ndusk, and they walked rapidly until they came to the log across the\npath.\n\n\"So your friend isn't crazy,\" he said tentatively, as he tried to assist\nher over it.\n\n\"That depends,\" she replied, drawing away from him; \"you're indefinite.\"\n\n\"Forgot to wet the rag, didn't we?\" he asked. \"I will gladly assume the\nimplication, however, if I may be your friend.\"\n\n\"Kind, I'm sure,\" she answered, with distant politeness.\n\nThe path widened, and he walked by her side. \"Have you noticed, Miss\nThorne, that we have trouble every time we approach that seemingly\ninnocent barrier? I think it would be better to keep away from it, don't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"What initials were those on the boulder? J. H. and--\"\n\n\"J. B.\"\n\n\"I thought so. 'J. B.' must have had a lot of spare time at his\ndisposal, for his initials are cut into the 'Widder' Pendleton's gate\npost on the inner side, and into an apple tree in the back yard.\"\n\n\"How interesting!\"\n\n\"Did you know Joe and Hepsey were going out to-night?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't--they're not my intimate friends.\"\n\n\"I don't see how Joe expects to marry on the income derived from the\nvillage chariot.\"\n\n\"Have they got that far?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Winfield, with the air of one imparting a\nconfidence. \"You see, though I have been in this peaceful village for\nsome little time, I have not yet arrived at the fine distinction between\n'walking out, 'settin' up,' and 'stiddy comp'ny.' I should infer that\n'walking out' came first, for 'settin' up' must take a great deal\nmore courage, but even 1, with my vast intellect, cannot at present\nunderstand 'stiddy comp'ny.'\"\n\n\"Joe takes her out every Sunday in the carriage,\" volunteered Ruth, when\nthe silence became awkward.\n\n\"In the what?\"\n\n\"Carriage--haven't you ridden in it?\"\n\n\"I have ridden in them, but not in it. I walked to the 'Widder's,' but\nif it is the conveyance used by travellers, they are both 'walking out'\nand 'settin' up.'\"\n\nThey paused at the gate. \"Thank you for a pleasant afternoon,\" said\nWinfield. \"I don't have many of them.\"\n\n\"You're welcome,\" returned Ruth, conveying the impression of great\ndistance.\n\nWinfield sighed, then made a last desperate attempt. \"Miss Thorne,\" he\nsaid, pleadingly, \"please don't be unkind to me. You have my reason in\nyour hands. I can see myself now, sitting on the floor, at one end of\nthe dangerous ward. They'll smear my fingers with molasses and give me\nhalf a dozen feathers to play with. You'll come to visit the asylum,\nsometime, when you're looking for a special, and at first, you won't\nrecognise me. Then I'll say: 'Woman, behold your work,' and you'll be\nmiserable all the rest of your life.\"\n\nShe laughed heartily at the distressing picture, and the plaintive\ntone of his voice pierced her armour. \"What's the matter with you?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"I don't know--I suppose it's my eyes. I'm horribly restless and\ndiscontented, and it isn't my way.\"\n\nThen Ruth remembered her own restless weeks, which seemed so long ago,\nand her heart stirred with womanly sympathy. \"I know,\" she said, in a\ndifferent tone, \"I've felt the same way myself, almost ever since I've\nbeen here, until this very afternoon. You're tired and nervous, and you\nhaven't anything to do, but you'll get over it.\"\n\n\"I hope you're right. I've been getting Joe to read the papers to me,\nat a quarter a sitting, but his pronunciation is so unfamiliar that it's\nhard to get the drift, and the whole thing exasperated me so that I had\nto give it up.\"\n\n\"Let me read the papers to you,\" she said, impulsively, \"I haven't seen\none for a month.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. \"I don't want to impose upon you,\" he\nanswered--\"no, you mustn't do it.\"\n\nRuth saw a stubborn pride that shrank from the slightest dependence, a\nself-reliance that would not falter, but would steadfastly hold aloof,\nand she knew that in one thing, at least, they were kindred.\n\n\"Let me,\" she cried, eagerly; \"I'll give you my eyes for a little\nwhile!\"\n\nWinfield caught her hand and held it for a moment, fully understanding.\nRuth's eyes looked up into his--deep, dark, dangerously appealing, and\nalight with generous desire.\n\nHis fingers unclasped slowly. \"Yes, I will,\" he said, strangely moved.\n\"It's a beautiful gift--in more ways than one. You are very kind--thank\nyou--good night!\"\n\n\n\n\nVII. The Man Who Hesitates\n\n\"Isn't fair',\" said Winfield to himself, miserably, \"no sir, 't isn't\nfair!\"\n\nHe sat on the narrow piazza which belonged to Mrs. Pendleton's brown\nhouse, and took stern account of his inner self. The morning paper lay\nbeside him, unopened, though his fingers itched to tear the wrapper, and\nhis hat was pulled far down over his eyes, to shade them from the sun.\n\n\"If I go up there I'm going to fall in love with her, and I know it!\"\n\nThat moment of revelation the night before, when soul stood face to\nface with soul, had troubled him strangely. He knew himself for a\nsentimentalist where women were concerned, but until they stood at the\ngate together, he had thought himself safe. Like many another man, on\nthe sunny side of thirty, he had his ideal woman safely enshrined in his\ninner consciousness.\n\nShe was a pretty little thing, this dream maiden--a blonde, with deep\nblue eyes, a rosy complexion, and a mouth like Cupid's bow. Mentally,\nshe was of the clinging sort, for Winfield did not know that in this\nhe was out of fashion. She had a dainty, bird-like air about her and\na high, sweet voice--a most adorable little woman, truly, for a man to\ndream of when business was not too pressing.\n\nIn almost every possible way, Miss Thorne was different. She was dark,\nand nearly as tall as he was; dignified, self-possessed, and calm,\nexcept for flashes of temper and that one impulsive moment. He had liked\nher, found her interesting in a tantalising sort of way, and looked upon\nher as an oasis in a social desert, but that was all.\n\nOf course, he might leave the village, but he made a wry face upon\ndiscovering, through laboured analysis, that he didn't want to go away.\nIt was really a charming spot--hunting and fishing to be had for the\nasking, fine accommodations at Mrs. Pendleton's, beautiful scenery,\nbracing air--in every way it was just what he needed. Should he let\nhimself be frightened out of it by a newspaper woman who lived at the\ntop of the hill? Hardly!\n\nNone the less, he realised that a man might firmly believe in Affinity,\nand, through a chain of unfortunate circumstances, become the victim\nof Propinquity. He had known of such instances and was now face to face\nwith the dilemma.\n\nThen his face flooded with dull colour. \"Darn it,\" he said to himself,\nsavagely, \"what an unmitigated cad I am! All this is on the assumption\nthat she's likely to fall on my neck at any minute! Lord!\"\n\nYet there was a certain comfort in the knowledge that he was safe, even\nif he should fall in love with Miss Thorne. That disdainful young woman\nwould save him from himself, undoubtedly, when he reached the danger\npoint, if not before.\n\n\"I wonder how a fellow would go about it anyway,\" he thought. \"He\ncouldn't make any sentimental remarks, without being instantly frozen.\nShe's like the Boston girls we read about in the funny papers. He\ncouldn't give her things, either, except flowers or books, or sweets, or\nmusic. She has more books than she wants, because she reviews'em for the\npaper, and I don't think she's musical. She doesn't look like the candy\nfiends, and I imagine she'd pitch a box of chocolates into the sad sea,\nor give it to Hepsey. There's nothing left but flowers--and I suppose\nshe wouldn't notice'em.\n\n\"A man would have to teach her to like him, and, on my soul, I don't\nknow how he'd do that. Constant devotion wouldn't have any effect--I\ndoubt if she'd permit it; and a fellow might stay away from her for\nsix months, without a sign from her. I guess she's cold--no, she isn't,\neither--eyes and temper like hers don't go with the icebergs.\n\n\"I--that is, he couldn't take her out, because there's no place to go.\nIt's different in the city, of course, but if he happened to meet her in\nthe country, as I've done--\n\n\"Might ask her to drive, possibly, if I could rent Alfred and Mamie for\na few hours--no, we'd have to have the day, for anything over two miles,\nand that wouldn't be good form, without a chaperone. Not that she needs\none--she's equal to any emergency, I fancy. Besides, she wouldn't go.\nIf I could get those two plugs up the hill, without pushing 'em, gravity\nwould take'em back, but I couldn't ask her to walk up the hill after\nthe pleasure excursion was over. I don't believe a drive would entertain\nher.\n\n\"Perhaps she'd like to fish--no, she wouldn't, for she said she didn't\nlike worms. Might sail on the briny deep, except that there's no harbour\nwithin ten miles, and she wouldn't trust her fair young life to me.\nShe'd be afraid I'd drown her.\n\n\"I suppose the main idea is to cultivate a clinging dependence, but I'd\nlike to see the man who could woo any dependence from Miss Thorne. She\nholds her head like a thoroughbred touched with the lash. She said she\nwas afraid of Carlton, but I guess she was just trying to be pleasant.\nI'll tell him about it--no, I won't, for I said I wouldn't.\n\n\"I wish there was some other girl here for me to talk to, but I'll be\nlucky if I can get along peaceably with the one already here. I'll have\nto discover all her pet prejudices and be careful not to walk on any of\n'em. There's that crazy woman, for instance--I mustn't allude to her,\neven respectfully, if I'm to have any softening feminine influence about\nme before I go back to town. She didn't seem to believe I had any letter\nfrom Carlton--that's what comes of being careless.\n\n\"I shouldn't have told her that people said she had large feet and wore\nmen's shoes. She's got a pretty foot; I noticed it particularly before I\nspoke--I suppose she didn't like that--most girls wouldn't, I guess, but\nshe took it as a hunter takes a fence. Even after that, she said she'd\nhelp me be patient, and last night, when she said she'd read the papers\nto me--she was awfully sweet to me then.\n\n\"Perhaps she likes me a little bit--I hope so. She'd never care very\nmuch for anybody, though--she's too independent. She wouldn't even let\nme help her up the hill; I don't know whether it was independence, or\nwhether she didn't want me to touch her. If we ever come to a place\nwhere she has to be helped, I suppose I'll have to put gloves on, or let\nher hold one end of a stick while I hang on to the other.\n\n\"Still she didn't take her hand away last night, when I grabbed it.\nProbably she was thinking about something else, and didn't notice. It's\na particularly nice hand to hold, but I'll never have another chance, I\nguess.\n\n\"Carlton said she'd take the conceit out of me, if I had any. I'm glad\nhe didn't put that in the letter, still it doesn't matter, since I've lost\nit. I wish I hadn't, for what he said about me was really very nice.\nCarlton is a good fellow.\n\n\"How she lit on me when I thought the crazy person might make a good\nspecial! Jerusalem! I felt like the dust under her feet. I'd be glad\nto have anybody stand up for me, like that, but nobody ever will. She's\nmighty pretty when she's angry, but I'd rather she wouldn't get huffy at\nme. She's a tremendously nice girl--there's no doubt of that.\"\n\nAt this juncture, Joe came out on the porch, hat in hand. \"Mornin', Mr.\nWinfield.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Joe; how are your troubles this morning?\"\n\n\"They're ill right, I guess,\" he replied, pleased with the air of\ncomradeship. \"Want me to read the paper to yer?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Joe, not this morning.\"\n\nThe tone was a dismissal, but Joe lingered, shifting from one foot to\nthe other. \"Ain't I done it to suit yer?\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" returned Winfield, serenely.\n\n\"I don't mind doin' it,\" Joe continued, after a long silence. \"I won't\ncharge yer nothin'.\"\n\n\"You're very kind, Joe, but I don't care about it to-day.\" Winfield rose\nand walked to the other end of the porch. The apple trees were in bloom,\nand every wandering wind was laden with sweetness. Even the gnarled old\ntree in Miss Hathaway's yard, that had been out of bearing for many a\nyear, had put forth a bough of fragrant blossoms. He saw it from where\nhe stood; a mass of pink and white against the turquoise sky, and\nthought that Miss Thorne would make a charming picture if she stood\nbeneath the tree with the blown petals drifting around her.\n\nHe lingered upon the vision till Joe spoke again. \"Be you goin' up to\nMiss Hathaway's this mornin'?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know,\" Winfield answered somewhat resentfully, \"why?\"\n\n\"'Cause I wouldn't go--not if I was in your place.\"\n\n\"Why?\" he demanded, facing him.\n\n\"Miss Hathaway's niece, she's sick.\"\n\n\"Sick!\" repeated Winfield, in sudden fear, \"what's the matter!\"\n\n\"Oh,'t ain't nothin' serious, I reckon, cause she's up and around. I've\njust come from there, and Hepsey said that all night Miss Thorne was\na-cryin', and that this mornin' she wouldn't eat no breakfast. She\ndon't never eat much, but this mornin' she wouldn't eat nothin', and she\nwouldn't say what was wrong with her.\"\n\nWinfield's face plainly showed his concern.\n\n\"She wouldn't eat nothin' last night, neither,\" Joe went on. \"Hepsey\ntold me this mornin' that she thought p'raps you and her had fit. She's\nyour girl, ain't she?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Winfield, \"she isn't my girl, and we haven't 'fit.' I'm\nsorry she isn't well.\"\n\nHe paced back and forth moodily, while Joe watched him in silence.\n\"Well,\" he said, at length, \"I reckon I'll be movin' along. I just\nthought I'd tell yer.\"\n\nThere was no answer, and Joe slammed the gate in disgust. \"I wonder\nwhat's the matter,\" thought Winfield. \"'T isn't a letter, for to-day's\nmail hasn't come and she was all right last night. Perhaps she isn't\nill--she said she cried when she was angry. Great Heavens! I hope she\nisn't angry at me!\n\n\"She was awfully sweet to me just before I left her,\" he continued,\nmentally, \"so I'm not to blame. I wonder if she's angry at herself\nbecause she offered to read the papers to me?\"\n\nAll unknowingly he had arrived at the cause of Miss Thorne's\nunhappiness. During a wakeful, miserable night, she had wished a\nthousand times that she might take back those few impulsive words.\n\n\"That must be it,\" he thought, and then his face grew tender. \"Bless her\nsweet heart,\" he muttered, apropos of nothing, \"I'm not going to make\nher unhappy. It's only her generous impulse, and I won't let her think\nit's any more.\"\n\nThe little maiden of his dreams was but a faint image just then, as he\nsat down to plan a course of action which would assuage Miss Thorne's\ntears. A grey squirrel appeared on the gate post, and sat there, calmly,\ncracking a nut.\n\nHe watched the little creature, absently, and then strolled toward the\ngate. The squirrel seemed tame and did not move until he was almost near\nenough to touch it, and then it scampered only a little way.\n\n\"I'll catch it,\" Winfield said to himself, \"and take it up to Miss\nThorne. Perhaps she'll be pleased.\"\n\nIt was simple enough, apparently, for the desired gift was always close\nat hand. He followed it across the hill, and bent a score of times\nto pick it up, but it was a guileful squirrel and escaped with great\nregularity.\n\nSuddenly, with a flaunt of its bushy tail and a daring, backward glance,\nit scampered under the gate into Miss Ainslie's garden and Winfield\nlaughed aloud. He had not known he was so near the other house and was\nabout to retreat when something stopped him.\n\nMiss Ainslie stood in the path just behind the gate, with her face\nghastly white and her eyes wide with terror, trembling like a leaf.\nThere was a troubled silence, then she said, thickly, \"Go!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he answered, hurriedly, \"I did not mean to frighten\nyou.\"\n\n\"Go!\" she said again, her lips scarcely moving, \"Go!\"\n\n\"Now what in the mischief have I done;\" he thought, as he crept away,\nfeeling like a thief. \"I understood that this was a quiet place and yet\nthe strenuous life seems to have struck the village in good earnest.\n\n\"What am I, that I should scare the aged and make the young weep? I've\nalways been considered harmless, till now. That must be Miss Thorne's\nfriend, whom I met so unfortunately just now. She's crazy, surely, or\nshe wouldn't have been afraid of me. Poor thing, perhaps I startled\nher.\"\n\nHe remembered that she had carried a basket and worn a pair of gardening\ngloves. Even though her face was so changed, for an instant he had\nseen its beauty--the deep violet eyes, fair skin, and regular features,\nsurmounted by that wonderful crown of silvered hair.\n\nConflicting emotions swayed him as he wended his way to the top of the\nhill, with the morning paper in his pocket as an excuse, if he should\nneed one. When he approached the gate, he was seized by a swift and\nunexplainable fear, and would have turned back, but Miss Hathaway's door\nwas opened.\n\nThen the little maiden of his dreams vanished, waving her hand in token\nof eternal farewell, for as Ruth came down the path between the white\nand purple plumes of lilac, with a smile of welcome upon her lips, he\nknew that, in all the world, there was nothing half so fair.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. Summer Days\n\nThe rumble of voices which came from the kitchen was not disturbing, but\nwhen the rural lovers began to sit on the piazza, directly under Ruth's\nwindow, she felt called upon to remonstrate.\n\n\"Hepsey,\" she asked, one morning, \"why don't you and Joe sit under the\ntrees at the side of the house? You can take your chairs out there.\"\n\n\"Miss Hathaway allerss let us set on the piazzer,\" returned Hepsey,\nunmoved.\n\n\"Miss Hathaway probably sleeps more soundly than I do. You don't want me\nto hear everything you say, do you?\"\n\nHepsey shrugged her buxom shoulders. \"You can if you like, mum.\"\n\n\"But I don't like,\" snapped Ruth. \"It annoys me.\"\n\nThere was an interval of silence, then Hepsey spoke again, of her own\naccord. \"If Joe and me was to set anywheres but in front, he might see\nthe light.\"\n\n\"Well, what of it?\"\n\n\"Miss Hathaway, she don't want it talked of, and men folks never can\nkeep secrets,\" Hepsey suggested.\n\n\"You wouldn't have to tell him, would you?\"\n\n\"Yes'm. Men folks has got terrible curious minds. They're all right if\nthey don't know there's nothin', but if they does, why they's keen.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you're right, Hepsey,\" she replied, biting her lips. \"Sit\nanywhere you please.\"\n\nThere were times when Ruth was compelled to admit that Hepsey's mental\ngifts were fully equal to her own. It was unreasonable to suppose, even\nfor an instant, that Joe and Hepsey had not pondered long and earnestly\nupon the subject of the light in the attic window, yet the argument\nwas unanswerable. The matter had long since lost its interest for\nRuth--perhaps because she was too happy to care.\n\nWinfield had easily acquired the habit of bringing her his morning\npapers, and, after the first embarrassment, Ruth settled down to it in\na businesslike way. Usually, she sat in Miss Hathaway's sewing chair,\nunder a tree a little way from the house, that she might at the same\ntime have a general supervision of her domain, while Winfield stretched\nhimself upon the grass at her feet. When the sun was bright, he wore his\ndark glasses, thereby gaining an unfair advantage.\n\nAfter breakfast, which was a movable feast at the \"Widder's,\" he went\nafter his mail and brought hers also. When he reached the top of the\nhill, she was always waiting for him.\n\n\"This devotion is very pleasing,\" he remarked, one morning.\n\n\"Some people are easily pleased,\" she retorted. \"I dislike to spoil your\npleasure, but my stern regard for facts compels me to say that it is not\nMr. Winfield I wait for, but the postman.\"\n\n\"Then I'll always be your postman, for I 'do admire' to be waited for,\nas they have it at the 'Widder's.' Of course, it's more or less of an\nexpense--this morning, for instance, I had to dig up two cents to get\none of your valuable manuscripts out of the clutches of an interested\ngovernment.\"\n\n\"That's nothing,\" she assured him, \"for I save you a quarter every day,\nby taking Joe's place as reader to Your Highness, not to mention the\nhigh tariff on the Sunday papers. Besides, the manuscripts are all in\nnow.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that,\" he replied, sitting down on the piazza. \"Do\nyou know, Miss Thorne, I think there's a great deal of joyous excitement\nattached to the pursuit of literature. You send out a story, fondly\nbelieving that it is destined to make you famous. Time goes on, and\nyou hear nothing from it. You can see your name 'featured' on the\nadvertisements of the magazine, and hear the heavy tread of the fevered\nmob, on the way to buy up the edition. In the roseate glow of your\nfancy, you can see not only your cheque, but the things you're going\nto buy with it. Perhaps you tell your friends, cautiously, that you're\nwriting for such and such a magazine. Before your joy evaporates, the\nthing comes back from the Dead Letter Office, because you hadn't put\non enough postage, and they wouldn't take it in. Or, perhaps they've\nwritten 'Return' on the front page in blue pencil, and all over it are\nlittle, dark, four-fingered prints, where the office pup has walked on\nit.\"\n\n\"You seem to be speaking from experience.\"\n\n\"You have guessed it, fair lady, with your usual wonderful insight. Now\nlet's read the paper--do you know, you read much better than Joe does?\"\n\n\"Really?\" Ruth was inclined to be sarcastic, but there was a delicate\ncolour in her cheeks, which pleased his aesthetic sense.\n\nAt first, he had had an insatiable thirst for everything in the paper,\nexcept the advertisements. The market reports were sacrificed inside\nof a week, and the obituary notices, weather indications, and foreign\ndespatches soon followed. Later, the literary features were eliminated,\nbut the financial and local news died hard. By the end of June, however,\nhe was satisfied with the headlines.\n\n\"No, thank you, I don't want to hear about the murder,\" he said, in\nanswer to Ruth's ironical question, \"nor yet the Summer styles in\nsleeves. All that slop on the Woman's Page, about making home happy, is\nnot suited to such as I, and I'll pass.\"\n\n\"There's a great deal here that's very interesting,\" returned Ruth, \"and\nI doubt if I myself could have crammed more solid knowledge into one\nWoman's Page. Here's a full account of a wealthy lady's Summer home, and\na description of a poor woman's garden, and eight recipes, and half a\ncolumn on how to keep a husband at home nights, and plans for making a\nchina closet out of an old bookcase.\"\n\n\"If there's anything that makes me dead tired,\" remarked Winfield, \"it's\nthat homemade furniture business.\"\n\n\"For once, we agree,\" answered Ruth. \"I've read about it till I'm\ncompletely out of patience. Shirtwaist boxes from soap boxes, dressing\ntables from packing boxes, couches from cots, hall lamps from old arc\nlight globes, and clothes hampers from barrels--all these I endured, but\nthe last straw was a 'transformed kitchen.'\"\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" begged Winfield, who was enjoying himself hugely.\n\n\"The stove was to be set into the wall,\" began Ruth, \"and surrounded\nwith marble and white tiling, or, if this was too expensive, it was to\nbe hidden from view by a screen of Japanese silk. A nice oak settle,\nhand carved, which 'the young husband might make in his spare moments,'\nwas to be placed in front of it, and there were to be plate racks and\nshelves on the walls, to hold the rare china. Charming kitchen!\"\n\nHer cheeks were flushed and her eyes shone like stars. \"You're an\nawfully funny girl,\" said Winfield, quietly, \"to fly into a passion\nover a 'transformed kitchen' that you never saw. Why don't you save your\ntemper for real things?\"\n\nShe looked at him, meaningly, and he retreated in good order. \"I think\nI'm a tactful person,\" he continued, hurriedly, \"because I get on so\nwell with you. Most of the time, we're as contented as two kittens in a\nbasket.\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. Winfield,\" returned Ruth, pleasantly, \"you're not only\ntactful, but modest. I never met a man whose temperament so nearly\napproached the unassuming violet. I'm afraid you'll never be appreciated\nin this world--you're too good for it. You must learn to put yourself\nforward. I expect it will be a shock to your sensitive nature, but it's\ngot to be done.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he laughed. \"I wish we were in town now, and I'd begin\nto put myself forward by asking you out to dinner and afterward to the\ntheatre.\"\n\n\"Why don't you take me out to dinner here?\" she asked.\n\n\"I wouldn't insult you by offering you the 'Widder's' cooking. I mean a\nreal dinner, with striped ice cream at the end of it.\"\n\n\"I'll go,\" she replied, \"I can't resist the blandishments of striped ice\ncream.\"\n\n\"Thank you again; that gives me courage to speak of something that has\nlain very near my heart for a long time.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Ruth, conventionally. For the moment she was frightened.\n\n\"I've been thinking fondly of your chafing-dish, though I haven't been\nallowed to see it yet, and I suppose there's nothing in the settlement\nto cook in it, is there?\"\n\n\"Nothing much, surely.\"\n\n\"We might have some stuff sent out from the city, don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Canned things?\"\n\n\"Yes--anything that would keep.\"\n\nAided and abetted by Winfield, she made out a list of articles which\nwere unknown to the simple-minded inhabitants of the village.\n\n\"I'll attend to the financial part of it,\" he said, pocketing the list,\n\"and then, my life will be in your hands.\"\n\nAfter he went away, Ruth wished she knew more about the gentle art of\ncooking, which, after all, is closely allied to the other one--of making\nenemies. She decided to dispense with Hepsey's services, when Winfield\ncame up to dinner, and to do everything herself.\n\nShe found an old cook book of Aunt Jane's and turned over its pages with\nnew interest. It was in manuscript form, and seemed to represent the\nculinary knowledge of the entire neighbourhood. Each recipe was duly\naccredited to its original author, and there were many newspaper\nclippings, from the despised \"Woman's Page\" in various journals.\n\nRuth thought it would be an act of kindness to paste the loose clippings\ninto Aunt Jane's book, and she could look them over as she fastened them\nin. The work progressed rapidly, until she found a clipping which\nwas not a recipe. It was a perfunctory notice of the death of Charles\nWinfield, dated almost eighteen years ago.\n\nShe remembered the various emotions old newspapers had given her when\nshe first came to Aunt Jane's. This was Abigail Weatherby's husband--he\nhad survived her by a dozen years. \"I'm glad it's Charles Winfield\ninstead of Carl,\" thought Ruth, as she put it aside, and went on with\nher work.\n\n\"Pantry's come,\" announced Winfield, a few days later; \"I didn't open\nit, but I think everything is there. Joe's going to bring it up.\"\n\n\"Then you can come to dinner Sunday,\" answered Ruth, smiling.\n\n\"I'll be here,\" returned Winfield promptly. \"What time do we dine?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly. It's better to wait, I think, until Hepsey goes\nout. She always regards me with more or less suspicion, and it makes me\nuncomfortable.\"\n\nSunday afternoon, the faithful Joe drove up to the gate, and Hepsey\nemerged from her small back room, like a butterfly from a chrysalis. She\nwas radiant in a brilliant blue silk, which was festooned at irregular\nintervals with white silk lace. Her hat was bending beneath its burden\nof violets and red roses, starred here and there with some unhappy\nbuttercups which had survived the wreck of a previous millinery triumph.\nHer hands were encased in white cotton gloves, which did not fit.\n\nWith Joe's assistance, she entered the vehicle and took her place\nproudly on the back seat, even while he pleaded for her to sit beside\nhim.\n\n\"You know yourself that I can't drive nothin' from the back seat,\" he\ncomplained.\n\n\"Nobody's askin' you to drive nothin' from nowhere,\" returned Hepsey,\nscornfully. \"If you can't take me out like a lady, I ain't a-goin'.\"\n\nRuth was dazzled by the magnificence of the spectacle and was unable to\ntake her eyes away from it, even after Joe had turned around and started\ndown hill. She thought Winfield would see them pass his door and time\nhis arrival accordingly, so she was startled when he came up behind her\nand said, cheerfully:\n\n\"They look like a policeman's, don't they?\"\n\n\"What--who?\"\n\n\"Hepsey's hands--did you think I meant yours?\"\n\n\"How long have you been here?\"\n\n\"Nearly thirty years.\"\n\n\"That wasn't what I meant,\" said Ruth, colouring. \"How long have you\nbeen at Aunt Jane's?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's different. When Joe went out to harness his fiery steeds to\nhis imposing chariot, I went around through the woods, across the beach,\nclimbed a vertical precipice, and came up this side of the hill. I had\nto wait some little time, but I had a front seat during the show.\"\n\nHe brought out her favourite chair, placing it under the maple tree,\nthen sat down near her. \"I should think you'd get some clothes like\nHepsey's,\" he began. \"I'll wager, now, that you haven't a gown like that\nin your entire wardrobe.\"\n\n\"You're right--I haven't. The nearest approach to it is a tailored gown,\nlined with silk, which Hepsey thinks I should wear wrong side out.\"\n\n\"How long will the coast be clear?\"\n\n\"Until nine o'clock, I think. They go to church in the evening.\"\n\n\"It's half past three now,\" he observed, glancing at his watch. \"I had\nfried salt pork, fried eggs, and fried potatoes for breakfast. I've\nrenounced coffee, for I can't seem to get used to theirs. For dinner,\nwe had round steak, fried, more fried potatoes, and boiled onions. Dried\napple pie for dessert--I think I'd rather have had the mince I refused\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"I'll feed you at five o'clock,\" she said, smiling.\n\n\"That seems like a long time,\" he complained.\n\n\"It won't, after you begin to entertain me.\"\n\nIt was after five before either realised it. \"Come on,\" she said, \"you\ncan sit in the kitchen and watch me.\"\n\nHe professed great admiration while she put on one of Hepsey's white\naprons, and when she appeared with the chafing-dish, his emotion was\nbeyond speech. He was allowed to open the box and to cut up some button\nmushrooms, while she shredded cold chicken. \"I'm getting hungry every\nminute,\" he said, \"and if there is undue postponement, I fear I shall\nassimilate all the raw material in sight--including the cook.\"\n\nRuth laughed happily. She was making a sauce with real cream, seasoned\ndelicately with paprika and celery salt. \"Now I'll put in the chicken\nand mushrooms,\" she said, \"and you can stir it while I make toast.\"\n\nThey were seated at the table in the dining-room and the fun was at its\nheight, when they became aware of a presence. Hepsey stood in the door,\napparently transfixed with surprise, and with disapproval evident in\nevery line of her face. Before either could speak, she was gone.\n\nThough Ruth was very much annoyed, the incident seemingly served to\naccentuate Winfield's enjoyment. The sound of wheels on the gravel\noutside told them that she was continuing her excursion.\n\n\"I'm going to discharge her to-morrow,\" Ruth said.\n\n\"You can't--she is in Miss Hathaway's service, not yours. Besides,\nwhat has she done? She came back, probably, after something she had\nforgotten. You have no reasonable ground for discharging her, and I\nthink you'd be more uncomfortable if she went than if she stayed.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you're right,\" she admitted.\n\n\"I know how you feel about it,\" he went on, \"but I hope you won't let\nher distress you. It doesn't make a bit of difference to me; she's only\namusing. Please don't bother about it.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" said Ruth, \"that is, I'll try not to.\"\n\nThey piled the dishes in the sink, \"as a pleasant surprise for Hepsey,\"\nhe said, and the hours passed as if on wings. It was almost ten o'clock\nbefore it occurred to Winfield that his permanent abode was not Miss\nHathaway's parlour.\n\nAs they stood at the door, talking, the last train came in. \"Do you\nknow,\" said Winfield, \"that every night, just as that train comes in,\nyour friend down there puts a candle in her front window?\"\n\n\"Well,\" rejoined Ruth, sharply, \"what of it? It's a free country, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Very. Untrammelled press and highly independent women. Good night, Miss\nThorne. I'll be up the first thing in the morning.\"\n\nShe was about to speak, but slammed the door instead, and was displeased\nwhen she heard a smothered laugh from outside.\n\n\n\n\nIX. By Humble Means\n\nAs lightly as a rose petal upon the shimmering surface of a stream,\nSummer was drifting away, but whither, no one seemed to care. The odour\nof printer's ink upon the morning paper no longer aroused vain longings\nin Winfield's breast, and Ruth had all but forgotten her former\nconnection with the newspaper world.\n\nBy degrees, Winfield had arranged a routine which seemed admirable.\nUntil luncheon time, he was with Ruth and, usually, out of doors,\naccording to prescription. In the afternoon, he went up again, sometimes\nstaying to dinner, and, always, he spent his evenings there.\n\n\"Why don't you ask me to have my trunk sent up here?\" he asked Ruth, one\nday.\n\n\"I hadn't thought of it,\" she laughed. \"I suppose it hasn't seemed\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"Miss Hathaway would be pleased, wouldn't she, if she knew she had two\nguests instead of one?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly; how could she help it?\"\n\n\"When do you expect her to return?\"\n\n\"I don't know--I haven't heard a word from her. Sometimes I feel a\nlittle anxious about her.\" Ruth would have been much concerned for her\nrelative's safety, had she known that the eccentric lady had severed\nherself from the excursion and gone boldly into Italy, unattended, and\nwith no knowledge of the language.\n\nHepsey inquired daily for news of Miss Hathaway, but no tidings were\nforthcoming. She amused herself in her leisure moments by picturing all\nsorts of disasters in which her mistress was doubtless engulfed, and in\nspeculating upon the tie between Miss Thorne and Mr. Winfield.\n\nMore often than not, it fell to Hepsey to light the lamp in the attic\nwindow, though she did it at Miss Thorne's direction. \"If I forget it,\nHepsey,\" she had said, calmly, \"you'll see to it, won't you?\"\n\nTrunks, cedar chests, old newspapers, and long hidden letters were out\nof Ruth's province now. Once in two or three weeks, she went to see Miss\nAinslie, but never stayed long, though almost every day she reproached\nherself for neglect.\n\nWinfield's days were filled with peace, since he had learned how to get\non with Miss Thorne. When she showed herself stubborn and unyielding, he\nretreated gracefully, and with a suggestion of amusement, as a courtier\nmay step aside gallantly for an angry lady to pass. Ruth felt his mental\nattitude and, even though she resented it, she was ashamed.\n\nHaving found that she could have her own way, she became less anxious\nfor it, and several times made small concessions, which were apparently\nunconscious, but amusing, nevertheless. She had none of the wiles of the\ncoquette; she was transparent, and her friendliness was disarming. If\nshe wanted Winfield to stay at home any particular morning or afternoon,\nshe told him so. At first he was offended, but afterward learned to like\nit, for she could easily have instructed Hepsey to say that she was out.\n\nThe pitiless, unsympathetic calendar recorded the fact that July was\nnear its end, and Ruth sighed--then hated herself for it.\n\nShe had grown accustomed to idleness, and, under the circumstances,\nliked it far too well.\n\nOne morning, when she went down to breakfast, Hepsey was evidently\nperplexed about something, but Ruth took no outward note of it, knowing\nthat it would be revealed ere long.\n\n\"Miss Thorne,\" she said, tentatively, as Ruth rose from the table.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Of course, Miss Thorne, I reckon likely't ain't none of my business,\nbut is Mr. Winfield another detective, and have you found anything out\nyet?\"\n\nRuth, inwardly raging, forced herself to let the speech pass unnoticed,\nand sailed majestically out of the room. She was surprised to discover\nthat she could be made so furiously angry by so small a thing.\n\nWinfield was coming up the hill with the mail, and she tried to cool her\nhot cheeks with her hands. \"Let's go down on the side of the hill,\" she\nsaid, as he gave her some letters and the paper; \"it's very warm in the\nsun, and I'd like the sea breeze.\"\n\nThey found a comparatively level place, with two trees to lean against,\nand, though they were not far from the house, they were effectually\nscreened by the rising ground. Ruth felt that she could not bear the\nsight of Hepsey just then.\n\nAfter glancing at her letters she began to read aloud, with a troubled\nhaste which did not escape him. \"Here's a man who had a little piece\nof bone taken out of the inside of his skull,\" she said. \"Shall I read\nabout that? He seems, literally, to have had something on his mind.\"\n\n\"You're brilliant this morning,\" answered Winfield, gravely, and she\nlaughed hysterically.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" he asked. \"You don't seem like yourself.\"\n\n\"It isn't nice of you to say that,\" she retorted, \"considering your\nprevious remark.\"\n\nThere was a rumble and a snort on the road and, welcoming the diversion,\nhe went up to reconnoitre. \"Joe's coming; is there anything you want in\nthe village?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered, wearily, \"there's nothing I want--anywhere.\"\n\n\"You're an exceptional woman,\" returned Winfield, promptly, \"and\nI'd advise you to sit for your photograph. The papers would like\nit--'Picture of the Only Woman Who Doesn't Want Anything'--why, that\nwould work off an extra in about ten minutes!\"\n\nRuth looked at him for a moment, then turned her eyes away. He felt\nvaguely uncomfortable, and was about to offer atonement when Joe's deep\nbass voice called out:\n\n\"Hello!\"\n\n\"Hello yourself!\" came in Hepsey's highest tones, from the garden.\n\n\"Want anything to-day?\"\n\n\"Nope!\"\n\nThere was a brief pause, and then Joe shouted again: \"Hepsey!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I should think they'd break their vocal cords,\" said Winfield.\n\n\"I wish they would,\" rejoined Ruth, quickly.\n\n\"Come here!\" yelled Joe. \"I want to talk to yer.\"\n\n\"Talk from there,\" screamed Hepsey.\n\n\"Where's yer folks?\"\n\n\"D'know.\"\n\n\"Say, be they courtin'?\"\n\nHepsey left her work in the garden and came toward the front of the\nhouse. \"They walk out some,\" she said, when she was halfway to the gate,\n\"and they set up a good deal, and Miss Thorne told me she didn't know as\nshe'd do better, but you can't rightly say they're courtin' 'cause city\nways ain't like our'n.\"\n\nThe deep colour dyed Ruth's face and her hands twitched nervously.\nWinfield very much desired to talk, but could think of nothing to say.\nThe situation was tense.\n\nJoe clucked to his horses. \"So long,\" he said. \"See yer later.\"\n\nRuth held her breath until he passed them, and then broke down. Her self\ncontrol was quite gone, and she sobbed bitterly, in grief and shame.\nWinfield tucked his handkerchief into her cold hands, not knowing what\nelse to do.\n\n\"Don't!\" he said, as if he, too, had been hurt. \"Ruth, dear, don't cry!\"\n\nA new tenderness almost unmanned him, but he sat still with his hands\nclenched, feeling like a brute because of her tears.\n\nThe next few minutes seemed like an hour, then Ruth raised her head and\ntried to smile. \"I expect you think I'm silly,\" she said, hiding her\ntear stained face again.\n\n\"No!\" he cried, sharply; then, with a catch in his throat, he put his\nhand on her shoulder.\n\n\"Don't!\" she sobbed, turning away from him, \"what--what they said--was\nbad enough!\"\n\nThe last words ended in a rush of tears, and, sorely distressed, he\nbegan to walk back and forth. Then a bright idea came to him.\n\n\"I'll be back in a minute,\" he said.\n\nWhen he returned, he had a tin dipper, freshly filled with cold water.\n\"Don't cry any more,\" he pleaded, gently, \"I'm going to bathe your\nface.\"\n\nRuth leaned back against the tree and he knelt beside her. \"Oh, that\nfeels so good,\" she said, gratefully, as she felt his cool fingers\nupon her burning eyes. In a little while she was calm again, though her\nbreast still heaved with every fluttering breath.\n\n\"You poor little woman,\" he said, tenderly, \"you're just as nervous as\nyou can be. Don't feel so about it. Just suppose it was somebody who\nwasn't!\"\n\n\"Who wasn't what?\" asked Ruth, innocently.\n\nWinfield crimsoned to the roots of his hair and hurled the dipper into\nthe distance.\n\n\"What--what--they said,\" he stammered, sitting down awkwardly. \"Oh,\ndarn it!\" He kicked savagely at a root, and added, in bitterest self\naccusation, \"I'm a chump, I am!\"\n\n\"No you're not,\" returned Ruth, with sweet shyness, \"you're nice. Now\nwe'll read some more of the paper.\"\n\nHe assumed a feverish interest in the market reports, but his thoughts\nwere wandering. Certainly, nothing could have been worse. He felt as if\na bud, which he had been long and eagerly watching, was suddenly torn\nopen by a vandal hand. When he first touched Ruth's eyes with his finger\ntips, he had trembled like a schoolboy, and he wondered if she knew it.\n\nIf she did, she made no sign. Her cheeks were flushed, the lids of her\ndowncast eyes were pink, and her voice had lost its crisp, incisive\ntones, but she read rapidly, without comment or pause, until the supply\nof news gave out. Then she began on the advertisements, dreading the\nend of her task and vainly wishing for more papers, though in her heart\nthere was something sweet, which, even to herself, she dared not name.\n\n\"That'll do,\" he said, abruptly, \"I'm not interested in the 'midsummer\nglove clearing.' I meant to tell you something when I first came--I've\ngot to go away.\"\n\nRuth's heart throbbed painfully, as if some cold hand held it fast.\n\"Yes,\" she said, politely, not recognising her own voice.\n\n\"It's only for a week--I've got to go to the oculist and see about some\nother things. I'll be back before long.\"\n\n\"I shall miss you,\" she said, conventionally. Then she saw that he was\ngoing away to relieve her from the embarrassment of his presence, and\nblessed him accordingly.\n\n\"When are you going?\" she asked.\n\n\"This afternoon. I don't want to go, but it's just as well to have it\nover with. Can I do anything for you in the city?\"\n\n\"No, thank you. My wants are few and, at present, well supplied.\"\n\n\"Don't you want me to match something for you? I thought women always\nhad pieces of stuff that had to be matched immediately.\"\n\n\"They made you edit the funny column, didn't they?\" she asked,\nirrelevantly.\n\n\"They did, Miss Thorne, and, moreover, I expect I'll have to do it\nagain.\"\n\nAfter a little, they were back on the old footing, yet everything was\ndifferent, for there was an obtruding self consciousness on either side.\n\"What time do you go?\" she asked, with assumed indifference.\n\n\"Three-fifteen, I think, and it's after one now.\"\n\nHe walked back to the house with her, and, for the second time that day,\nHepsey came out to sweep the piazza.\n\n\"Good bye, Miss Thorne,\" he said.\n\n\"Good bye, Mr. Winfield.\"\n\nThat was all, but Ruth looked up with an unspoken question and his eyes\nmet hers clearly, with no turning aside. She knew he would come back\nvery soon and she understood his answer--that he had the right.\n\nAs she entered the house, Hepsey said, pleasantly: \"Has he gone away,\nMiss Thorne?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, without emotion. She was about to say that she did\nnot care for luncheon, then decided that she must seem to care.\n\nStill, it was impossible to escape that keen-eyed observer. \"You ain't\neatin' much,\" she suggested.\n\n\"I'm not very hungry.\"\n\n\"Be you sick, Miss Thorne?\"\n\n\"No--not exactly. I've been out in the sun and my head aches,\" she\nreplied, clutching at the straw.\n\n\"Do you want a wet rag?\"\n\nRuth laughed, remembering an earlier suggestion of Winfield's. \"No, I\ndon't want any wet rag, Hepsey, but I'll go up to my room for a little\nwhile, I think. Please don't disturb me.\"\n\nShe locked her door, shutting out all the world from the nameless joy\nthat surged in her heart. The mirror disclosed flushed, feverish cheeks\nand dark eyes that shone like stars. \"Ruth Thorne,\" she said to herself,\n\"I'm ashamed of you! First you act like a fool and then like a girl of\nsixteen!\"\n\nThen her senses became confused and the objects in the room circled\naround her unsteadily. \"I'm tired,\" she murmured. Her head sank drowsily\ninto the lavender scented pillow and she slept too soundly to take note\nof the three o'clock train leaving the station. It was almost sunset\nwhen she was aroused by voices under her window.\n\n\"That feller's gone home,\" said Joe.\n\n\"Do tell!\" exclaimed Hepsey. \"Did he pay his board?\"\n\n\"Yep, every cent. He's a-comin' back.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"D'know. Don't she know?\" The emphasis indicated Miss Thorne.\n\n\"I guess not,\" answered Hepsey. \"They said good bye right in front of\nme, and there wa'n't nothin' said about it.\"\n\n\"They ain't courtin', then,\" said Joe, after a few moments of painful\nthought, and Ruth, in her chamber above, laughed happily to herself.\n\n\"Mebbe not,\" rejoined Hepsey. \"It ain't fer sech as me to say when\nthere's courtin' and when there ain't, after havin' gone well nigh onto\nfive year with a country loafer what ain't never said nothin'.\" She\nstalked into the house, closed the door, and noisily bolted it. Joe\nstood there for a moment, as one struck dumb, then gave a long, low\nwhistle of astonishment and walked slowly down the hill.\n\n\n\n\nX. Love Letters\n\n\"A week!\" Ruth said to herself the next morning. \"Seven long days! No\nletter, because he mustn't write, no telegram, because there's no office\nwithin ten miles--nothing to do but wait!\"\n\nWhen she went down to breakfast, Hepsey did not seem to hear her cheery\ngreeting, but was twisting her apron and walking about restlessly. \"Miss\nThorne,\" she said, at length, \"did you ever get a love letter?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, of course,\" laughed Ruth. \"Every girl gets love letters.\"\n\nHepsey brightened visibly, then inquired, with great seriousness: \"Can\nyou read writin', Miss Thorne?\"\n\n\"That depends on the writing.\"\n\n\"Yes'm, it does so. I can read some writin'--I can read Miss Hathaway's\nwritin', and some of the furrin letters she's had, but I got some this\nmornin' I can't make out, nohow.\"\n\n\"Where did you find 'writing' this morning? It's too early for the mail,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes'm. It was stuck under the kitchen winder.\" Hepsey looked up at the\nceiling in an effort to appear careless, and sighed. Then she clutched\nviolently at the front of her blue gingham dress, immediately repenting\nof her rashness. Ruth was inwardly amused but asked no helpful\nquestions.\n\nFinally, Hepsey took the plunge. \"Would you mind tryin' to make out some\nwritin' I've got, Miss Thorne?\"\n\n\"Of course not--let me see it.\"\n\nHepsey extracted a letter from the inmost recesses of her attire and\nstood expectantly, with her hands on her hips.\n\n\"Why, it's a love letter!\" Ruth exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes'm. When you get through readin' it to yourself, will you read it\nout loud?\"\n\nThe letter, which was written on ruled note paper, bore every evidence\nof care and thought. \"Hepsey,\" it began, and, on the line below, with a\ngreat flourish under it, \"Respected Miss\" stood, in large capitals.\n\n\"Although it is now but a short interval,\" Ruth read, \"since my\ndelighted eyes first rested on your beautiful form--\"\n\n\"Five year!\" interjected Hepsey.\n\n\"--yet I dare to hope that you will receive graciously what I am about\nto say, as I am assured you will, if you reciprocate the sentiments\nwhich you have aroused in my bosom.\n\n\"In this short time, dear Miss, brief though it is, yet it has proved\namply sufficient for my heart to go out to you in a yearning love which\nI have never before felt for one of your sex. Day by day and night by\nnight your glorious image has followed me.\"\n\n\"That's a lie,\" interrupted Hepsey, \"he knows I never chased him\nnowheres, not even when he took that red-headed Smith girl to the\nSunday-school picnic over to the Ridge, a year ago come August.\"\n\n\"Those dark tresses have entwined my soul in their silken meshes, those\ndeep eyes, that have borrowed their colour from Heaven's cerulean\nblue, and those soft white hands, that have never been roughened by\nuncongenial toil, have been ever present in my dreams.\"\n\nRuth paused for a moment, overcome by her task, but Hepsey's face was\nradiant. \"Hurry up, Miss Thorne,\" she said, impatiently.\n\n\"In short, Dear Miss, I consider you the most surpassingly lovely of\nyour kind, and it is with pride swelling in my manly bosom that I dare\nto ask so peerless a jewel for her heart and hand.\n\n\"My parentage, birth, and breeding are probably known to you, but should\nany points remain doubtful, I will be pleased to present references as\nto my character and standing in the community.\n\n\"I await with impatience, Madam, your favourable answer to my plea. Rest\nassured that if you should so honour me as to accept my proposal, I will\nendeavour to stand always between you and the hard, cruel world, as\nyour faithful shield. I will also endeavour constantly to give you a\nhappiness as great as that which will immediately flood my bing upon\nreceipt of your blushing acceptance.\n\n\"I remain, Dear Miss, your devoted lover and humble servant,\n\n\"JOSEPH PENDLETON, ESQ.\"\n\n\"My! My!\" ejaculated Hepsey. \"Ain't that fine writin'!\"\n\n\"It certainly is,\" responded Miss Thorne, keeping her face straight with\ndifficulty.\n\n\"Would you mind readin' it again?\"\n\nShe found the second recital much easier, since she was partially\naccustomed to the heavy punctuation marks and shaded flourishes. At\nfirst, she had connected Winfield with the effusion, but second thought\nplaced the blame where it belonged--at the door of a \"Complete Letter\nWriter.\"\n\n\"Miss Thorne,\" said Hepsey, hesitating.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Of course, I'd like my answer to be as good writin' as his'n.\"\n\n\"Naturally.\"\n\n\"Where d'you s'pose he got all that lovely grammar?\"\n\n\"Grammar is a rare gift, Hepsey.\"\n\n\"Yes'm,'t is so. Miss Thorne, do you guess you could write as good as\nthat?\"\n\n\"I'd be willing to try,\" returned Ruth, with due humility.\n\nHepsey thought painfully for a few moments. \"I'd know jest what I'd\nbetter say. Now, last night, I give Joe a hint, as you may say, but I\nwouldn't want him to think I'd jest been a-waitin' for him.\"\n\n\"No, of course not.\"\n\n\"Ain't it better to keep him in suspense, as you may say?\"\n\n\"Far better, Hepsey; he'll think more of you.\"\n\n\"Then I'll jest write that I'm willin' to think it over, and if you'll\nput it on a piece of paper fer me, I'll write it out with ink. I've got\ntwo sheets of paper jest like this, with nice blue lines onto it, that\nI've been a-savin' fer a letter, and Miss Hathaway, she's got ink.\"\n\nRuth sat down to compose an answer which should cast a shadow over the\n\"Complete Letter Writer.\" Her pencil flew over the rough copy paper with\nlightning speed, while Hepsey stood by in amazement.\n\n\"Listen,\" she said, at length, \"how do you like this?\"\n\n\"MR. JOSEPH PENDLETON--\n\n\"Respected Sir: Although your communication of recent date was a great\nsurprise to me, candour compels me to confess that it was not entirely\ndisagreeable. I have observed, though with true feminine delicacy, that\nyour affections were inclined to settle in my direction, and have not\nrepelled your advances.\n\n\"Still, I do not feel that as yet we are sufficiently acquainted to\nrender immediate matrimony either wise or desirable, and since the\nsuddenness of your proposal has in a measure taken my breath away, I\nmust beg that you will allow me a proper interval in which to consider\nthe matter, and, in the meantime, think of me simply as your dearest\nfriend.\n\n\"I may add, in conclusion, that your character and standing in the\ncommunity are entirely satisfactory to me. Thanking you for the honour\nyou have conferred upon me, believe me, Dear Sir,\n\n\"Your sincere friend,\n\n\"HEPSEY.\"\n\n\"My!\" exclaimed Hepsey, with overmastering pride; \"ain't that beautiful!\nIt's better than his'n, ain't it?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say that,\" Ruth replied, with proper modesty, \"but I think\nit will do.\"\n\n\"Yes'm. 'Twill so. Your writin' ain't nothin' like Joe's,\" she\ncontinued, scanning it closely, \"but it's real pretty.\" Then a bright\nidea illuminated her countenance. \"Miss Thorne, if you'll write it out\non the note paper with a pencil, I can go over it with the ink, and\nafterward, when it's dry, I'll rub out the pencil. It'll be my writin'\nthen, but it'll look jest like yours.\"\n\n\"All right, Hepsey.\"\n\nShe found it difficult to follow the lines closely, but at length\nachieved a respectable result. \"I'll take good care of it,\" Hepsey said,\nwrapping the precious missive in a newspaper, \"and this afternoon, when\nI get my work done up, I'll fix it. Joe'll be surprised, won't he?\"\n\nLate in the evening, when Hepsey came to Ruth, worn with the\nunaccustomed labours of correspondence, and proudly displayed the\nnondescript epistle, she was compelled to admit that unless Joe had\nsuperhuman qualities he would indeed \"be surprised.\"\n\n\nThe next afternoon Ruth went down to Miss Ainslie's. \"You've been\nneglecting me, dear,\" said that gentle soul, as she opened the door.\n\n\"I haven't meant to,\" returned Ruth, conscience-stricken, as she\nremembered how long it had been since the gate of the old-fashioned\ngarden had swung on its hinges for her.\n\nA quiet happiness had settled down upon Ruth and the old perturbed\nspirit was gone, but Miss Ainslie was subtly different. \"I feel as if\nsomething was going to happen,\" she said.\n\n\"Something nice?\"\n\n\"I--don't know.\" The sweet face was troubled and there were fine lines\nabout the mouth, such as Ruth had never seen there before.\n\n\"You're nervous, Miss Ainslie--it's my turn to scold now.\"\n\n\"I never scolded you, did I deary?\"\n\n\"You couldn't scold anybody--you're too sweet. You're not unhappy, are\nyou, Miss Ainslie?\"\n\n\"I? Why, no! Why should I be unhappy?\" Her deep eyes were fixed upon\nRuth.\n\n\"I--I didn't know,\" Ruth answered, in confusion.\n\n\"I learned long ago,\" said Miss Ainslie, after a little, \"that we may be\nhappy or not, just as we choose. Happiness is not a circumstance, nor a\nset of circumstances; it's only a light, and we may keep it burning if\nwe will. So many of us are like children, crying for the moon, instead\nof playing contentedly with the few toys we have. We're always hoping\nfor something, and when it does n't come we fret and worry; when\nit does, why there's always something else we'd rather have. We\ndeliberately make nearly all of our unhappiness, with our own\nunreasonable discontent, and nothing will ever make us happy, deary,\nexcept the spirit within.\"\n\n\"But, Miss Ainslie,\" Ruth objected, \"do you really think everybody can\nbe happy?\"\n\n\"Of course--everybody who wishes to be. Some people are happier when\nthey're miserable. I don't mean, deary, that it's easy for any of us,\nand it's harder for some than for others, all because we never grow\nup. We're always children--our playthings are a little different, that's\nall.\"\n\n\"'Owning ourselves forever children,' quoted Ruth, \"'gathering pebbles\non a boundless shore.'\"\n\n\"Yes, I was just thinking of that. A little girl breaks her doll, and\nthough the new one may be much prettier, it never wholly fills the\nvacant place, and it's that way with a woman's dream.\" The sweet voice\nsank into a whisper, followed by a lingering sigh.\n\n\"Miss Ainslie,\" said Ruth, after a pause, \"did you know my mother?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't, deary--I'm sorry. I saw her once or twice, but she went\naway, soon after we came here.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Ruth said, hurriedly, for Mrs. Thorne's family had never\nforgiven her runaway marriage.\n\n\"Come into the garden,\" Miss Ainslie suggested, and Ruth followed\nher, willingly, into the cloistered spot where golden lilies tinkled,\nthrushes sang, and every leaf breathed peace.\n\nMiss Ainslie gathered a bit of rosemary, crushing it between her white\nfingers. \"See,\" she said, \"some of us are like that it takes a blow to\nfind the sweetness in our souls. Some of us need dry, hard places, like\nthe poppies \"--pointing to a mass of brilliant bloom--\"and some of us\nare always thorny, like the cactus, with only once in a while a rosy\nstar.\n\n\"I've always thought my flowers had souls, dear,\" she went on; \"they\nseem like real people to me. I've seen the roses rubbing their cheeks\ntogether as if they loved each other, and the forget-me-nots are little\nblue-eyed children, half afraid of the rest.\n\n\"Over there, it always seems to me as if the lavender was a little woman\nin a green dress, with a lavender bonnet and a white kerchief. She's one\nof those strong, sweet, wholesome people, who always rest you, and her\nsweetness lingers long after she goes away. I gather all the flowers,\nand every leaf, though the flowers are sweetest. I put the leaves away\nwith my linen and the flowers among my laces. I have some beautiful\nlace, deary.\"\n\n\"I know you have--I've often admired it.\"\n\n\"I'm going to show it to you some day,\" she said, with a little quiver\nin her voice, \"and some other day, when I can't wear it any more, you\nshall have some of it for your own.\"\n\n\"Don't, Miss Ainslie,\" cried Ruth, the quick tears coming to her eyes,\n\"I don't want any lace--I want you!\"\n\n\"I know,\" she answered, but there was a far-away look in her eyes, and\nsomething in her voice that sounded like a farewell.\n\n\"Miss Thorne,\" called Joe from the gate, \"here's a package for yer. It\ncome on the train.\"\n\nHe waited until Ruth went to him and seemed disappointed when she turned\nback into the garden. \"Say,\" he shouted, \"is Hepsey to home?\"\n\nRuth was busy with the string and did not hear. \"Oh, look!\" she\nexclaimed, \"what roses!\"\n\n\"They're beautiful, deary. I do not think I have ever seen such large\nones. Do you know what they are?\"\n\n\"American Beauties--they're from Mr. Winfield. He knows I love them.\"\n\nMiss Ainslie started violently. \"From whom, dear?\" she asked, in a\nstrange tone.\n\n\"Mr. Winfield--he's going to be on the same paper with me in the Fall.\nHe's here for the Summer, on account of his eyes.\"\n\nMiss Ainslie was bending over the lavender.\n\n\"It is a very common name, is it not?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, quite common,\" answered Ruth, absently, taking the roses out of\nthe box.\n\n\"You must bring him to see me some time, dear; I should like to know\nhim.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Ainslie, I will.\"\n\nThey stood at the gate together, and Ruth put a half blown rose into her\nhand. \"I wouldn't give it to anybody but you,\" she said, half playfully,\nand then Miss Ainslie knew her secret. She put her hand on Ruth's arm\nand looked down into her face, as if there was something she must say.\n\n\"I don't forget the light, Miss Ainslie.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she breathed, in answer. She looked long and searchingly into\nRuth's eyes, then whispered brokenly, \"God bless you, dear. Good bye!\"\n\n\n\n\nXI. The Rose of all the World\n\n\"He didn't forget me! He didn't forget me!\" Ruth's heart sang in time\nwith her step as she went home. Late afternoon flooded all the earth\nwith gold, and from the other side of the hill came the gentle music of\nthe sea.\n\nThe doors were open, but there was no trace of Hepsey. She put the\nroses in her water pitcher, and locked her door upon them as one hides a\nsacred joy. She went out again, her heart swelling like the throat of\na singing bird, and walked to the brow of the cliff, with every sense\nkeenly alive. Upon the surface of the ocean lay that deep, translucent\nblue which only Tadema has dared to paint.\n\n\"I must go down,\" she murmured.\n\nLike a tawny ribbon trailed upon the green, the road wound down the\nhill. She followed it until she reached the side path on the right, and\nwent down into the woods. The great boughs arched over her head like the\nnave of a cathedral, and the Little People of the Forest, in feathers\nand fur, scattered as she approached. Bright eyes peeped at her from\nbehind tree trunks, or the safe shelter of branches, and rippling bird\nmusic ended in a frightened chirp,\n\n\"Oh,\" she said aloud, \"don't be afraid!\"\n\nWas this love, she wondered, that lay upon her eyes like the dew of a\nSpring morning, that made the air vocal with rapturous song, and wrought\nwhite magic in her soul? It had all the mystery ind freshness of the\nworld's beginning; it was the rush of waters where sea and river meet,\nthe perfume of a flower, and the far light trembling from a star. It was\nsunrise where there had been no day, the ecstasy of a thousand dawns; a\nnew sun gleaming upon noon. All the joy of the world surged and beat in\nher pulses, till it seemed that her heart had wings.\n\nSunset came upon the water, the colour on the horizon reflecting soft\niridescence upon the blue. Slow sapphire surges broke at her feet,\ntossing great pearls of spray against the cliff. Suddenly, as if by\ninstinct, she turned--and faced Winfield.\n\n\"Thank you for the roses,\" she cried, with her face aglow.\n\nHe gathered her into his arms. \"Oh, my Rose of All the World,\" he\nmurmured, \"have I found you at last?\"\n\nIt was almost dusk when they turned to go home, with their arms around\neach other, as if they were the First Two, wandering through the shaded\ngroves of Paradise, before sin came into the world.\n\n\"Did you think it would be like this?\" she asked, shyly.\n\n\"No, I didn't, darling. I thought it would be very prim and proper. I\nnever dreamed you'd let me kiss you--yes, I did, too, but I thought it\nwas too good to be true.\"\n\n\"I had to--to let you,\" she explained, crimsoning, \"but nobody ever did\nbefore. I always thought--\" Then Ruth hid her face against his shoulder,\nin maidenly shame.\n\nWhen they came to the log across the path, they sat down, very close\ntogether. \"You said we'd fight if we came here,\" Ruth whispered.\n\n\"We're not going to, though. I want to tell you something, dear, and I\nhaven't had the words for it till now.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked, in alarm.\n\n\"It's only that I love you, Ruth,\" he said, holding her closer, \"and\nwhen I've said that, I've said all. It isn't an idle word; it's all my\nlife that I give you, to do with as you will. It isn't anything that's\napart from you, or ever could be; it's as much yours as your hands or\neyes are. I didn't know it for a little while--that's because I was\nblind. To think that I should go up to see you, even that first day,\nwithout knowing you for my sweetheart--my wife!\"\n\n\"No, don't draw away from me. You little wild bird, are you afraid of\nLove? It's the sweetest thing God ever let a man dream of, Ruth--there's\nnothing like it in all the world. Look up, Sweet Eyes, and say you love\nme!\"\n\nRuth's head drooped, and he put his hand under her chin, turning her\nface toward him, but her eyes were downcast still. \"Say it, darling,\" he\npleaded.\n\n\"I--I can't,\" she stammered.\n\n\"Why, dear?\"\n\n\"Because--because--you know.\"\n\n\"I want you to say it, sweetheart. Won't you?\"\n\n\"Sometime, perhaps.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"When--when it's dark.\"\n\n\"It's dark now.\"\n\n\"No it isn't. How did you know?\"\n\n\"How did I know what, dear?\"\n\n\"That I--that I--cared.\"\n\n\"I knew the day you cried. I didn't know myself until then, but it all\ncame in a minute.\"\n\n\"I was afraid you were going to stay away a whole week.\"\n\n\"I couldn't, darling--I just had to come.\"\n\n\"Did you see everybody you wanted to see?\"\n\n\"I couldn't see anything but your face, Ruth, with the tears on it. I've\ngot to go back to-morrow and have another try at the oculist.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, in acute disappointment.\n\n\"It's the last time, sweetheart; we'll never be separated again.\"\n\n\"Never?\"\n\n\"Never in all the world--nor afterward.\"\n\n\"I expect you think I'm silly,\" she said, wiping her eyes, as they rose\nto go home, \"but I don't want you to go away.\"\n\n\"I don't want to go, dearest. If you're going to cry, you'll have me a\nraving maniac. I can't stand it, now.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to,\" she answered, smiling through her tears, \"but it's a\nblessed privilege to have a nice stiff collar and a new tie to cry on.\"\n\n\"They're at your service, dear, for anything but that. I suppose we're\nengaged now, aren't we?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Ruth, in a low tone; \"you haven't asked me to marry\nyou.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to?\"\n\n\"It's time, isn't it?\"\n\nWinfield bent over and whispered to her.\n\n\"I must think about it,\" said Ruth, very gravely, \"it's so sudden.\"\n\n\"Oh, you sweet girl,\" he laughed, \"aren't you going to give me any\nencouragement?\"\n\n\"You've had some.\"\n\n\"I want another,\" he answered, purposely misunderstanding her, \"and\nbesides, it's dark now.\"\n\nThe sweet-scented twilight still lingered on the hillside, and a star or\ntwo gleamed through the open spaces above. A moment later, Ruth, in her\nturn, whispered to him. It was only a word or two, but the bright-eyed\nrobins who were peeping at them from the maple branches must have\nobserved that it was highly satisfactory.\n\n\n\n\nXII. Bride and Groom\n\nThough Winfield had sternly determined to go back to town the following\nday, he did not achieve departure until later. Ruth went to the station\nwith him, and desolation came upon her when the train pulled out, in\nspite of the new happiness in her heart.\n\nShe had little time to miss him, however, for, at the end of the week,\nand in accordance with immemorial custom, the Unexpected happened.\n\nShe was sitting at her window one morning, trying to sew, when the\nvillage chariot stopped at the gate and a lady descended. Joe stirred\nlazily on the front seat, but she said, in a clear, high-pitched voice:\n\"You needn't trouble yourself, Joe. He'll carry the things.\"\n\nShe came toward the house, fanning herself with a certain stateliness,\nand carrying her handkerchief primly, by the exact centre of it. In her\nwake was a little old gentleman, with a huge bundle, surrounded by a\nshawl-strap, a large valise, much the worse for wear, a telescope basket\nwhich was expanded to its full height, and two small parcels. A cane was\ntucked under one arm and an umbrella under the other. He could scarcely\nbe seen behind the mountain of baggage.\n\nHepsey was already at the door. \"Why, Miss Hathaway!\" she cried, in\nastonishment.\n\n\"'T ain't Miss Hathaway,\" rejoined the visitor, with some asperity,\n\"it's Mrs. Ball, and this is my husband. Niece Ruth, I presume,\" she\nadded, as Miss Thorne appeared. \"Ruth, let me introduce you to your\nUncle James.\"\n\nThe bride was of medium height and rather angular. Her eyes were small,\ndark, and so piercingly brilliant that they suggested jet beads.\nHer skin was dark and her lips had been habitually compressed into a\nstraight line. None the less, it was the face that Ruth had seen in the\nambrotype at Miss Ainslie's, with the additional hardness that comes to\nthose who grow old without love. Her bearing was that of a brisk, active\nwoman, accustomed all her life to obedience and respect.\n\nMr. Ball was two or three inches shorter than his wife, and had a white\nbeard, irregularly streaked with brown. He was baldheaded in front, had\nscant, reddish hair in the back, and his faded blue eyes were tearful.\nHe had very small feet and the unmistakable gait of a sailor. Though\nthere was no immediate resemblance, Ruth was sure that he was the\nman whose picture was in Aunt Jane's treasure chest in the attic. The\ndaredevil look was gone, however, and he was merely a quiet, inoffensive\nold gentleman, for whom life had been none too easy.\n\n\"Welcome to your new home, James,\" said his wife, in a crisp,\nbusinesslike tone, which but partially concealed a latent tenderness. He\nsmiled, but made no reply.\n\nHepsey still stood in the parlour, in wide mouthed astonishment, and it\nwas Ruth's good fortune to see the glance which Mrs. Ball cast upon her\noffending maid. There was no change of expression except in the eyes,\nbut Hepsey instantly understood that she was out of her place, and\nretreated to the kitchen with a flush upon her cheeks, which was\naltogether foreign to Ruth's experience.\n\n\"You can set here, James,\" resumed Mrs. Ball, \"until I have taken off my\nthings.\"\n\nThe cherries on her black straw bonnet were shaking on their stems in a\nway which fascinated Ruth. \"I'll take my things out of the south room,\nAunty,\" she hastened to say.\n\n\"You won't, neither,\" was the unexpected answer; \"that's the spare room,\nand, while you stay, you'll stay there.\"\n\nRuth was wondering what to say to her new uncle and sat in awkward\nsilence as Aunt Jane ascended the stairs. Her step sounded lightly\noverhead and Mr. Ball twirled his thumbs absently. \"You--you've come a\nlong way, haven't you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes'm, a long way.\" Then, seemingly for the first time, he looked at\nher, and a benevolent expression came upon his face. \"You've got awful\npretty hair, Niece Ruth,\" he observed, admiringly; \"now Mis' Ball, she\nwears a false front.\"\n\nThe lady of the house returned at this juncture, with the false front a\nlittle askew. \"I was just a-sayin',\" Mr. Ball continued, \"that our niece\nis a real pleasant lookin' woman.\"\n\n\"She's your niece by marriage,\" his wife replied, \"but she ain't no real\nrelative.\"\n\n\"Niece by merriage is relative enough,\" said Mr.Ball, \"and I say she's a\npleasant lookin' woman, ain't she, now?\"\n\n\"She'll do, I reckon. She resembles her Ma.\" Aunt Jane looked at Ruth,\nas if pitying the sister who had blindly followed the leadings of her\nheart and had died unforgiven.\n\n\"Why didn't you let me know you were coming, Aunt Jane?\" asked Ruth.\n\"I've been looking for a letter every day and I understood you weren't\ncoming back until October.\"\n\n\"I trust I am not unwelcome in my own house,\" was the somewhat frigid\nresponse.\n\n\"No indeed, Aunty--I hope you've had a pleasant time.\"\n\n\"We've had a beautiful time, ain't we, James? We've been on our\nhoneymoon.\"\n\n\"Yes'm, we hev been on our honeymoon, travellin' over strange lands an'\nfurrin wastes of waters. Mis' Ball was terrible sea sick comin' here.\"\n\n\"In a way,\" said Aunt Jane, \"we ain't completely married. We was\nmarried by a heathen priest in a heathen country and it ain't rightfully\nbindin', but we thought it would do until we could get back here and be\nmarried by a minister of the gospel, didn't we, James?\"\n\n\"It has held,\" he said, without emotion, \"but I reckon we will hev to be\nmerried proper.\"\n\n\"Likewise I have my weddin' dress,\" Aunt Jane went on, \"what ain't never\nbeen worn. It's a beautiful dress--trimmed with pearl trimmin'\"--here\nRuth felt the pangs of a guilty conscience--\"and I lay out to be married\nin it, quite private, with you and Hepsey for witnesses.\"\n\n\"Why, it's quite a romance, isn't it, Aunty?\"\n\n\"'T is in a way,\" interjected Mr. Ball, \"and in another way, 't ain't.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ruth,\" Aunt Jane continued, ignoring the interruption, \"'t is a\nromance--a real romance,\" she repeated, with all the hard lines in her\nface softened. \"We was engaged over thirty-five year. James went to sea\nto make a fortin', so he could give me every luxury. It's all writ out\nin a letter I've got upstairs. They's beautiful letters, Ruth, and it's\ncome to me, as I've been settin' here, that you might make a book out'n\nthese letters of James's. You write, don't you?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, Aunty, I write for the papers but I've never done a book.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll never write a book no earlier, and here's all the\nmaterial, as you say, jest a-waitin' for you to copy it. I guess there's\nover a hundred letters.\"\n\n\"But, Aunty,\" objected Ruth, struggling with inward emotion, \"I couldn't\nsign my name to it, you know, unless I had written the letters.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it wouldn't be honest,\" she answered, clutching at the straw,\n\"the person who wrote the letters would be entitled to the credit--and\nthe money,\" she added hopefully.\n\n\"Why, yes, that's right. Do you hear James? It'll have to be your book,\n'The Love Letters of a Sailor,' by James, and dedicated in the front\n'to my dearly beloved wife, Jane Ball, as was Jane Hathaway.' It'll be\nbeautiful, won't it, James?\"\n\n\"Yes'm, I hev no doubt but what it will.\"\n\n\"Do you remember, James, how you borrered a chisel from the tombstone\nman over to the Ridge, and cut our names into endurin' granite?\"\n\n\"I'd forgot that--how come you to remember it?\"\n\n\"On account of your havin' lost the chisel and the tombstone man\na-worryin' me about it to this day. I'll take you to the place. There's\nclimbin' but it won't hurt us none, though we ain't as young as we might\nbe. You says to me, you says: 'Jane, darlin', as long as them letters\nstays cut into the everlastin' rock, just so long I'll love you,' you\nsays, and they's there still.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm here, too, ain't I?\" replied Mr. Ball, seeming to detect a\ncovert reproach. \"I was allers a great hand fer cuttin'.\"\n\n\"There'll have to be a piece writ in the end, Ruth, explainin' the happy\nendin' of the romance. If you can't do it justice, James and me can\nhelp--James was allers a master hand at writin'. It'll have to tell how\nthrough the long years he has toiled, hopin' against hope, and for over\nthirty years not darin' to write a line to the object of his affections,\nnot feelin' worthy, as you may say, and how after her waitin' faithfully\nat home and turnin' away dozens of lovers what pleaded violent-like,\nshe finally went travellin' in furrin parts and come upon her old lover\na-keepin' a store in a heathen land, a-strugglin' to retrieve disaster\nafter disaster at sea, and constantly withstandin' the blandishments of\nheathen women as endeavoured to wean him from his faith, and how, though\nvery humble and scarcely darin to speak, he learned that she was willin'\nand they come a sailin' home together and lived happily ever afterward.\nAin't that as it was, James?\"\n\n\"Yes'm, except that there wa'n't no particular disaster at sea and them\nheathen women didn't exert no blandishments. They was jest pleasant to\nan old feller, bless their little hearts.\"\n\nBy some subtle mental process, Mr. Ball became aware that he had made\na mistake. \"You ain't changed nothin' here, Jane,\" he continued,\nhurriedly, \"there's the haircloth sofy that we used to set on Sunday\nevenins' after meetin', and the hair wreath with the red rose in it made\nout of my hair and the white rose made out of your grandmother's hair\non your father's side, and the yeller lily made out of the hair of your\nUncle Jed's youngest boy. I disremember the rest, but time was when I\ncould say'm all. I never see your beat for makin' hair wreaths, Jane.\nThere ain't nothin' gone but the melodeon that used to set by the\nmantel. What's come of the melodeon?\"\n\n\"The melodeon is set away in the attic. The mice et out the inside.\"\n\n\"Didn't you hev no cat?\"\n\n\"There ain't no cat, James, that could get into a melodeon through a\nmouse hole, more especially the big maltese you gave me. I kept that\ncat, James, as you may say, all these weary years. When there was\nkittens, I kept the one that looked most like old Malty, but of late\nyears, the cats has all been different, and the one I buried jest afore\nI sailed away was yeller and white with black and brown spots--a kinder\ntortoise shell--that didn't look nothin' like Malty. You'd never have\nknowed they belonged to the same family, but I was sorry when she died,\non account of her bein' the last cat.\"\n\nHepsey, half frightened, put her head into the room. \"Dinner's ready,\"\nshe shouted, hurriedly shutting the door.\n\n\"Give me your arm, James,\" said Mrs. Ball, and Ruth followed them into\nthe dining-room.\n\nThe retired sailor ate heartily, casting occasional admiring glances\nat Ruth and Hepsey. It was the innocent approval which age bestows upon\nyouth. \"These be the finest biscuit,\" he said, \"that I've had for many a\nday. I reckon you made 'em, didn't you, young woman?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Hepsey, twisting her apron.\n\nThe bride was touched in a vulnerable spot.\n\n\"Hepsey,\" she said, decisively, \"when your week is up, you will no\nlonger be in my service. I am a-goin'to make a change.\"\n\nMr. Ball's knife dropped with a sharp clatter. \"Why, Mis' Ball,\" he\nsaid, reproachfully, \"who air you goin' to hev to do your work?\"\n\n\"Don't let that trouble you, James,\" she answered, serenely, \"the\nwashin' can be put out to the Widder Pendleton, her as was Elmiry\nPeavey, and the rest ain't no particular trouble.\"\n\n\"Aunty,\" said Ruth, \"now that you've come home and everything is going\non nicely, I think I'd better go back to the city. You see, if I stay\nhere, I'll be interrupting the honeymoon.\"\n\n\"No, no, Niece Ruth!\" exclaimed Mr. Ball, \"you ain't interruptin' no\nhoneymoon. It's a great pleasure to your aunt and me to hev you here--we\nlikes pretty young things around us, and as long as we hev a home,\nyou're welcome to stay in it; ain't she Jane?\"\n\n\"She has sense enough to see, James, that she is interruptin' the\nhoneymoon,\" replied Aunt Jane, somewhat harshly. \"On account of her\nmother havin' been a Hathaway before marriage, she knows things. Not\nbut what you can come some other time, Ruth,\" she added, with belated\nhospitality.\n\n\"Thank you, Aunty, I will. I'll stay just a day or two longer, if you\ndon't mind--just until Mr. Winfield comes back. I don't know just where\nto write to him.\"\n\n\"Mr.--who?\" demanded Aunt Jane, looking at her narrowly.\n\n\"Mr. Carl Winfield,\" said Ruth, crimsoning--\"the man I am going to\nmarry.\" The piercing eyes were still fixed upon her.\n\n\"Now about the letters, Aunty,\" she went on, in confusion, \"you could\nhelp Uncle James with the book much better than I could. Of course it\nwould have to be done under your supervision.\"\n\nMrs. Ball scrutinized her niece long and carefully. \"You appear to be\ntellin' the truth,\" she said. \"Who would best print it?\"\n\n\"I think it would be better for you to handle it yourself, Aunty, and\nthen you and Uncle James would have all the profits. If you let some one\nelse publish it and sell it, you'd have only ten per cent, and even\nthen, you might have to pay part of the expenses.\"\n\n\"How much does it cost to print a book?\"\n\n\"That depends on the book. Of course it costs more to print a large one\nthan a small one.\"\n\n\"That needn't make no difference,\" said Aunt Jane, after long\ndeliberation. \"James has two hundred dollars sewed up on the inside of\nthe belt he insists on wearin', instead of Christian suspenders, ain't\nyou, James?\"\n\n\"Yes'm, two hundred and four dollars in my belt and seventy-six cents in\nmy pocket.\"\n\n\"It's from his store,\" Mrs. Ball explained. \"He sold it to a relative of\none of them heathen women.\"\n\n\"It was worth more'n three hundred,\" he said regretfully.\n\n\"Now, James, you know a small store like that ain't worth no three\nhundred dollars. I wouldn't have let you took three hundred, 'cause it\nwouldn't be honest.\"\n\nThe arrival of a small and battered trunk created a welcome diversion.\n\"Where's your trunk, Uncle James?\" asked Ruth.\n\n\"I ain't a needin' of no trunk,\" he answered, \"what clothes I've got\nis on me, and that there valise has more of my things in it. When my\nclothes wears out, I put on new ones and leave the others for some pore\ncreeter what may need 'em worse'n me.\"\n\nAunt Jane followed Joe upstairs, issuing caution and direction at every\nstep. \"You can set outside now, Joe Pendleton,\" she said, \"and see that\nthem hosses don't run away, and as soon as I get some of my things hung\nup so's they won't wrinkle no more, I'll come out and pay you.\"\n\nJoe obeyed, casting longing eyes at a bit of blue gingham that was\nfluttering among the currant bushes in the garden. Mr. Ball, longing for\nconversation with his kind, went out to the gate and stood looking up at\nhim, blinking in the bright sunlight. \"Young feller,\" he said, \"I reckon\nthat starboard hoss is my old mare. Where'd you get it?\"\n\n\"Over to the Ridge,\" answered Joe, \"of a feller named Johnson.\"\n\n\"Jest so--I reckon 't was his father I give Nellie to when I went away.\nShe was a frisky filly then--she don't look nothin' like that now.\"\n\n\"Mamie\" turned, as if her former master's voice had stirred some old\nmemory. \"She's got the evil eye,\" Mr. Ball continued. \"You wanter be\nkeerful.\"\n\n\"She's all right, I guess,\" Joe replied.\n\n\"Young feller,\" said Mr. Ball earnestly, \"do you chew terbacker?\"\n\n\"Yep, but I ain't got no more. I'm on the last hunk.\"\n\nMr. Ball stroked his stained beard. \"I useter,\" he said, reminiscently,\n\"afore I was merried.\"\n\nJoe whistled idly, still watching for Hepsey.\n\n\"Young feller,\" said Mr. Ball, again, \"there's a great deal of merryin'\nand givin' in merriage in this here settlement, ain't there?\"\n\n\"Not so much as there might be.\"\n\n\"Say, was your mother's name Elmiry Peavey?\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" Joe answered, much surprised.\n\n\"Then you be keerful,\" cautioned Mr. Ball. \"Your hoss has got the\nevil eye and your father, as might hev been, allers had a weak eye fer\nwomen.\" Joe's face was a picture of blank astonishment. \"I was engaged\nto both of 'em,\" Mr. Ball explained, \"each one a-keepin' of it\nsecret, and she--\" here he pointed his thumb suggestively toward the\nhouse--\"she's got me.\"\n\n\"I'm going to be married myself,\" volunteered Joe, proudly.\n\n\"Merriage is a fleetin' show--I wouldn't, if I was in your place.\nMerriage is a drag on a man's ambitions. I set out to own a schooner,\nbut I can't never do it now, on account of bein' merried. I had a good\nstart towards it--I had a little store all to myself, what was worth\nthree or four hundred dollars, in a sunny country where the women folks\nhad soft voices and pretty ankles and wasn't above passin' jokes with an\nold feller to cheer 'im on 'is lonely way.\"\n\nMrs. Ball appeared at the upper window. \"James,\" she called, \"you'd\nbetter come in and get your hat. Your bald spot will get all sunburned.\"\n\n\"I guess I won't wait no longer, Miss Hathaway,\" Joe shouted, and,\nsuiting the action to the word, turned around and started down hill. Mr.\nBall, half way up the gravelled walk, turned back to smile at Joe with\nfeeble jocularity.\n\nHearing the familiar voice, Hepsey hastened to the front of the house,\nand was about to retreat, when Mr. Ball stopped her.\n\n\"Pore little darlin',\" he said, kindly, noting her tear stained face.\n\"Don't go--wait a minute.\" He fumbled at his belt and at last extracted\na crisp, new ten dollar bill. \"Here, take that and buy you a ribbon or\nsunthin' to remember your lovin' Uncle James by.\"\n\nHepsey's face brightened, and she hastily concealed the bill in her\ndress. \"I ain't your niece,\" she said, hesitatingly, \"it's Miss Thorne.\"\n\n\"That don't make no difference,\" rejoined Mr. Ball, generously, \"I'm\nwillin' you should be my niece too. All pretty young things is my\nnieces and I loves 'em all. Won't you give your pore old uncle a kiss to\nremember you by?\"\n\nRuth, who had heard the last words, came down to the gravelled walk.\n\"Aunt Jane is coming,\" she announced, and Hepsey fled.\n\nWhen the lady of the house appeared, Uncle James was sitting at one end\nof the piazza and Ruth at the other, exchanging decorous commonplaces.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. Plans\n\nHepsey had been gone an hour before Mrs. Ball realised that she had sent\naway one of the witnesses of her approaching wedding. \"It don't matter,\"\nshe said to Ruth, \"I guess there's others to be had. I've got the dress\nand the man and one of 'em and I have faith that the other things will\ncome.\"\n\nNevertheless, the problem assumed undue proportions. After long study,\nshe decided upon the minister's wife. \"If 'twa'nt that the numskulls\nround here couldn't understand two weddin's,\" she said, \"I'd have it in\nthe church, as me and James first planned.\"\n\nPreparations for the ceremony went forward with Aunt Jane's customary\ndecision and briskness. She made a wedding cake, assisted by Mr. Ball,\nand gathered all the flowers in the garden. There was something pathetic\nabout her pleasure; it was as though a wedding had been laid away in\nlavender, not to see the light for more than thirty years.\n\nRuth was to assist in dressing the bride and then go after the minister\nand his wife, who, by Aunt Jane's decree, were to have no previous\nwarning. \"'T ain't necessary to tell 'em beforehand, not as I see,\" said\nMrs. Ball. \"You must ask fust if they're both to home, and if only one\nof 'em is there, you'll have to find somebody else. If the minister's to\nhome and his wife ain't gaddin', he'll get them four dollars in James's\nbelt, leavin' an even two hundred, or do you think two dollars would be\nenough for a plain marriage?\"\n\n\"I'd leave that to Uncle James, Aunty.\"\n\n\"I reckon you're right, Ruth--you've got the Hathaway sense.\"\n\nThe old wedding gown was brought down from the attic and taken out of\nits winding sheet. It had been carefully folded, but every crease showed\nplainly and parts of it had changed in colour. Aunt Jane put on her best\n\"foretop,\" which was entirely dark, with no softening grey hair, and was\nreserved for occasions of high state. A long brown curl, which was hers\nby right of purchase, was pinned to the hard, uncompromising twist at\nthe back of her neck.\n\nRuth helped her into the gown and, as it slipped over her head, she\ninquired, from the depths of it: \"Is the front door locked?\"\n\n\"Yes, Aunty, and the back door too.\"\n\n\"Did you bring up the keys as I told you to?\"\n\n\"Yes, Aunty, here they are. Why?\"\n\nThere was a pause, then Mrs. Ball said solemnly: \"I've read a great deal\nabout bridegrooms havin' wanderin' fits immediately before weddin's.\nDoes my dress hike up in the back, Ruth?\"\n\nIt was a little shorter in the back than in the front and cleared the\nfloor on all sides, since she had grown a little after it was made,\nbut Ruth assured her that everything was all right. When they went\ndownstairs together, Mr. Ball was sitting in the parlour, plainly\nnervous.\n\n\"Now Ruth,\" said Aunt Jane, \"you can go after the minister. My first\nchoice is Methodis', after that Baptis' and then Presbyterian. I will\nentertain James durin' your absence.\"\n\nRuth was longing for fresh air and gladly undertook the delicate\nmission. Before she was half way down the hill, she met Winfield, who\nhad come on the afternoon train.\n\n\"You're just in time to see a wedding,\" she said, when the first\nraptures had subsided.\n\n\"Whose wedding, sweetheart? Ours?\"\n\n\"Far from it,\" answered Ruth, laughing. \"Come with me and I'll explain.\"\n\nShe gave him a vivid description of the events that had transpired\nduring his absence, and had invited him to the wedding before it\noccurred to her that Aunt Jane might not be pleased. \"I may be obliged\nto recall my invitation,\" she said seriously, \"I'll have to ask Aunty\nabout it. She may not want you.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make any difference,\" announced Winfield, in high spirits,\n\"I'm agoin' to the wedding and I'm a-goin' to kiss the bride, if you'll\nlet me.\"\n\nRuth smothered a laugh. \"You may, if you want to, and I won't be\njealous. Isn't that sweet of me?\"\n\n\"You're always sweet, dear. Is this the abode of the parson?\"\n\nThe Methodist minister was at home, but his wife was not, and Ruth\ndetermined to take Winfield in her place. The clergyman said that he\nwould come immediately, and, as the lovers loitered up the hill, they\narrived at the same time.\n\nWinfield was presented to the bridal couple, but there was no time for\nconversation, since Aunt Jane was in a hurry. After the brief ceremony\nwas over, Ruth said wickedly:\n\n\"Aunty, on the way to the minister's, Mr. Winfield told me he was going\nto kiss the bride. I hope you don't mind?\"\n\nWinfield looked unutterable things at Ruth, but nobly fulfilled the\nobligation. Uncle James beamed upon Ruth in a way which indicated that\nan attractive idea lay behind it, and Winfield created a diversion by\ntipping over a vase of flowers. \"He shan't,\" he whispered to Ruth, \"I'll\nbe darned if he shall!\"\n\n\"Ruth,\" said Aunt Jane, after a close scrutiny of Winfield, \"if you'\nrelayin' out to marry that awkward creeter, what ain't accustomed to\na parlour, you'd better do it now, while him and the minister are both\nhere.\"\n\nWinfield was willing, but Ruth said that one wedding at a time was\nenough in any family, and the minister, pledged to secrecy, took his\ndeparture. The bride cut the wedding cake and each solemnly ate a piece\nof it. It was a sacrament, rather than a festivity.\n\nWhen the silence became oppressive, Ruth suggested a walk.\n\n\"You will set here, Niece Ruth,\" remarked Aunt Jane, \"until I have\nchanged my dress.\"\n\nUncle James sighed softly, as she went upstairs. \"Well,\" he said,\n\"I'm merried now, hard and fast, and there ain't no help for it, world\nwithout end.\"\n\n\"Cheer up, Uncle,\" said Winfield, consolingly, \"it might be worse.\"\n\n\"It's come on me all of a sudden,\" he rejoined. \"I ain't had no time to\nprepare for it, as you may say. Little did I think, three weeks ago, as\nI set in my little store, what was wuth four or five hundred dollars,\nthat before the month was out, I'd be merried. Me! Merried!\" he\nexclaimed, \"Me, as never thought of sech!\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Ball entered, clad in sombre calico, Ruth, overcome by deep\nemotion, led her lover into the open air. \"It's bad for you to stay in\nthere,\" she said gravely, \"when you are destined to meet the same fate.\"\n\n\"I've had time to prepare for it,\" he answered, \"in fact, I've had more\ntime than I want.\"\n\nThey wandered down the hillside with aimless leisure, and Ruth stooped\nto pick up a large, grimy handkerchief, with \"C. W.\" in the corner.\n\"Here's where we were the other morning,\" she said.\n\n\"Blessed spot,\" he responded, \"beautiful Hepsey and noble Joe! By what\nhumble means are great destinies made evident! You haven't said you were\nglad to see me, dear.\"\n\n\"I'm always glad to see you, Mr. Winfield,\" she replied primly.\n\n\"Mr. Winfield isn't my name,\" he objected, taking her into his arms.\n\n\"Carl,\" she whispered shyly, to his coat collar.\n\n\"That isn't all of it.\"\n\n\"Carl--dear--\" said Ruth, with her face crimson.\n\n\"That's more like it. Now let's sit down--I've brought you something and\nyou have three guesses.\"\n\n\"Returned manuscript?\"\n\n\"No, you said they were all in.\"\n\n\"Another piece of Aunt Jane's wedding cake?\"\n\n\"No, guess again.\"\n\n\"Chocolates?\"\n\n\"Who'd think you were so stupid,\" he said, putting two fingers into his\nwaistcoat pocket.\n\n\"Oh--h!\" gasped Ruth, in delight.\n\n\"You funny girl, didn't you expect an engagement ring? Let's see if it\nfits.\"\n\nHe slipped the gleaming diamond on her finger and it fitted exactly.\n\n\"How did you guess?\" she asked, after a little.\n\n\"It wasn't wholly guess work, dearest.\" From another pocket, he drew a\nglove, of grey suede, that belonged to Ruth's left hand.\n\n\"Where did you get that?\"\n\n\"By the log across the path, that first day, when you were so cross to\nme.\"\n\n\"I wasn't cross!\"\n\n\"Yes you were--you were a little fiend.\"\n\n\"Will you forgive me?\" she pleaded, lifting her face to his.\n\n\"Rather!\" He forgave her half a dozen times before she got away from\nhim. \"Now let's talk sense,\" she said.\n\n\"We can't--I never expect to talk sense again.\"\n\n\"Pretty compliment, isn't it?\" she asked. \"It's like your telling me I\nwas brilliant and then saying I wasn't at all like myself.\" \"Won't you\nforgive me?\" he inquired significantly.\n\n\"Some other time,\" she said, flushing, \"now what are we going to do?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he began, \"I saw the oculist, and he says that my eyes are\nalmost well again, but that I mustn't use them for two weeks longer.\nThen, I can read or write for two hours every day, increasing gradually\nas long as they don't hurt. By the first of October, he thinks I'll be\nready for work again. Carlton wants me to report on the morning of the\nfifth, and he offers me a better salary than I had on The Herald.\"\n\n\"That's good!\"\n\n\"We'll have to have a flat in the city, or a little house in the\ncountry, near enough for me to get to the office.\"\n\n\"For us to get to the office,\" supplemented Ruth.\n\n\"What do you think you're going to do, Miss Thorne?\"\n\n\"Why--I'm going to keep right on with the paper,\" she answered in\nsurprise.\n\n\"No you're not, darling,\" he said, putting his arm around her. \"Do you\nsuppose I'm going to have Carlton or any other man giving my wife an\nassignment? You can't any way, because I've resigned your position for\nyou, and your place is already filled. Carlton sent his congratulations\nand said his loss was my gain, or something like that. He takes all the\ncredit to himself.\"\n\n\"Why--why--you wretch!\"\n\n\"I'm not a wretch--you said yourself I was nice. Look here, Ruth,\" he\nwent on, in a different tone, \"what do you think I am? Do you think for\na minute that I'd marry you if I couldn't take care of you?\"\n\n\"'T isn't that,\" she replied, freeing herself from his encircling arm,\n\"but I like my work and I don't want to give it up. Besides--besides--I\nthought you'd like to have me near you.\"\n\n\"I do want you near me, sweetheart, that isn't the point. You have the\nsame right that I have to any work that is your natural expression, but,\nin spite of the advanced age in which we live, I can't help believing\nthat home is the place for a woman. I may be old-fashioned, but I don't\nwant my wife working down town--I've got too much pride for that. You\nhave your typewriter, and you can turn out Sunday specials by the yard,\nif you want to. Besides, there are all the returned manuscripts--if you\nhave the time and aren't hurried, there's no reason why you shouldn't do\nwork that they can't afford to refuse.\"\n\nRuth was silent, and he laid his hand upon hers. \"You understand me,\ndon't you, dear? God knows I'm not asking you to let your soul rust out\nin idleness, and I wouldn't have you crave expression that was denied\nyou, but I don't want you to have to work when you don't feel like\nit, nor be at anybody's beck and call. I know you did good work on the\npaper--Carlton spoke of it, too--but others can do it as well. I want\nyou to do something that is so thoroughly you that no one else can do\nit. It's a hard life, Ruth, you know that as well as I do, and I--I love\nyou.\"\n\nHis last argument was convincing. \"I won't do anything you don't want me\nto do, dear,\" she said, with a new humility.\n\n\"I want you to be happy, dearest,\" he answered, quickly. \"Just try my\nway for a year--that's all I ask. I know your independence is sweet to\nyou, but the privilege of working for you with hand and brain, with your\nlove in my heart; with you at home, to be proud of me when I succeed and\nto give me new courage when I fail, why, it's the sweetest thing I've\never known.\"\n\n\"I'll have to go back to town very soon, though,\" she said, a little\nlater, \"I am interrupting the honeymoon.\"\n\n\"We'll have one of our own very soon that you can't interrupt, and, when\nyou go back, I'm going with you. We'll buy things for the house.\"\n\n\"We need lots of things, don't we?\" she asked.\n\n\"I expect we do, darling, but I haven't the least idea what they are.\nYou'll have to tell me.\"\n\n\"Oriental rugs, for one thing,\" she said, \"and a mahogany piano, and an\ninstrument to play it with, because I haven't any parlour tricks, and\nsome good pictures, and a waffle iron and a porcelain rolling pin.\"\n\n\"What do you know about rolling pins and waffle irons?\" he asked fondly.\n\n\"My dear boy,\" she replied, patronisingly, \"you forget that in the days\nwhen I was a free and independent woman, I was on a newspaper. I\nknow lots of things that are utterly strange to you, because, in all\nprobability, you never ran a woman's department. If you want soup, you\nmust boil meat slowly, and if you want meat, you must boil it rapidly,\nand if dough sticks to a broom straw when you jab it into a cake, it\nisn't done.\"\n\nHe laughed joyously. \"How about the porcelain rolling pin?\"\n\n\"It's germ proof,\" she rejoined, soberly.\n\n\"Are we going to keep house on the antiseptic plan?\"\n\n\"We are--it's better than the installment plan, isn't it? Oh, Carl!\" she\nexclaimed, \"I've had the brightest idea!\"\n\n\"Spring it!\" he demanded.\n\n\"Why, Aunt Jane's attic is full of old furniture, and I believe she'll\ngive it to us!\"\n\nHis face fell. \"How charming,\" he said, without emotion.\n\n\"Oh, you stupid,\" she laughed, \"it's colonial mahogany, every stick of\nit! It only needs to be done over!\"\n\n\"Ruth, you're a genius.\"\n\n\"Wait till I get it, before you praise me. Just stay here a minute and\nI'll run up to see what frame of mind she's in.\"\n\nWhen she entered the kitchen, the bride was busily engaged in getting\nsupper. Uncle James, with a blue gingham apron tied under his arms, was\nawkwardly peeling potatoes. \"Oh, how good that smells!\" exclaimed Ruth,\nas a spicy sheet of gingerbread was taken out of the oven.\n\nAunt Jane looked at her kindly, with gratified pride beaming from\nevery feature. \"I wish you'd teach me to cook, Aunty,\" she continued,\nfollowing up her advantage, \"you know I'm going to marry Mr. Winfield.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I'll teach you--where is he?\"\n\n\"He's outside--I just came in to speak to you a minute.\"\n\n\"You can ask him to supper if you want to.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Aunty, that's lovely of you. I know he'll like to stay.\"\n\n\"James,\" said Mrs. Ball, \"you're peelin' them pertaters with thick\npeelins' and you'll land in the poorhouse. I've never knowed it to fail.\"\n\n\"I wanted to ask you something, Aunty,\" Ruth went on quickly, though\nfeeling that the moment was not auspicious, \"you know all that old\nfurniture up in the attic?\"\n\n\"Well, what of it?\"\n\n\"Why--why--you aren't using it, you know, and I thought perhaps you'd be\nwilling to give it to us, so that we can go to housekeeping as soon as\nwe're married.\"\n\n\"It was your grandmother's,\" Aunt Jane replied after long thought, \"and,\nas you say, I ain't usin' it. I don't know but what you might as well\nhave it as anybody else. I lay out to buy me a new haircloth parlour\nsuit with that two hundred dollars of James's--he give the minister the\nhull four dollars over and above that--and--yes, you can have it,\" she\nconcluded.\n\nRuth kissed her, with real feeling. \"Thank you so much, Aunty. It will be\nlovely to have something that was my grandmother's.\"\n\nWhen she went back to Winfield, he was absorbed in a calculation he was\nmaking on the back of an envelope.\n\n\"You're not to use your eyes,\" she said warningly, \"and, oh Carl! It was\nmy grandmother's and she's given us every bit of it, and you're to stay\nto supper!\"\n\n\"Must be in a fine humour,\" he observed. \"I'm ever so glad. Come here,\ndarling, you don't know how I've missed you.\"\n\n\"I've been earning furniture,\" she said, settling down beside him.\n\"People earn what they get from Aunty--I won't say that, though, because\nit's mean.\"\n\n\"Tell me about this remarkable furniture. What is it, and how much of it\nis destined to glorify our humble cottage?\"\n\n\"It's all ours,\" she returned serenely, \"but I don't know just how\nmuch there is. I didn't look at it closely, you know, because I never\nexpected to have any of it. Let's see--there's a heavy dresser, and a\nlarge, round table, with claw feet--that's our dining-table, and there's\na bed, just like those in the windows in town, when it's done over, and\nthere's a big old-fashioned sofa, and a spinning-wheel--\"\n\n\"Are you going to spin?\"\n\n\"Hush, don't interrupt. There are five chairs--dining-room chairs, and\ntwo small tables, and a card table with a leaf that you can stand up\nagainst the wall, and two lovely rockers, and I don't know what else.\"\n\n\"That's a fairly complete inventory, considering that you 'didn't look\nat it closely.' What a little humbug you are!\"\n\n\"You like humbugs, don't you?\"\n\n\"Some, not all.\"\n\nThere was a long silence, and then Ruth moved away from him. \"Tell me\nabout everything,\" she said. \"Think of all the years I haven't known\nyou!\"\n\n\"There's nothing to tell, dear. Are you going to conduct an excavation\ninto my 'past?'\"\n\n\"Indeed, I'm not! The present is enough for me, and I'll attend to your\nfuture myself.\"\n\n\"There's not much to be ashamed of, Ruth,\" he said, soberly. \"I've\nalways had the woman I should marry in my mind--'the not impossible\nshe,' and my ideal has kept me out of many a pitfall I wanted to go to\nher with clean hands and a clean heart, and I have. I'm not a saint, but\nI'm as clean as I could be, and live in the world at all.\"\n\nRuth put her hand on his. \"Tell me about your mother.\"\n\nA shadow crossed his face and he waited a moment before speaking. \"My\nmother died when I was born,\" he said with an effort. \"I can't tell you\nabout her, Ruth, she--she--wasn't a very good woman.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, dear,\" she answered with quick sympathy, \"I don't want to\nknow!\"\n\n\"I didn't know about it until a few years ago,\" he continued, \"when some\nkindly disposed relatives of father's gave me full particulars. They're\ndead now, and I'm glad of it. She--she--drank.\"\n\n\"Don't, Carl!\" she cried, \"I don't want to know!\"\n\n\"You're a sweet girl, Ruth,\" he said, tenderly, touching her hand to\nhis lips. \"Father died when I was ten or twelve years old and I can't\nremember him very well, though I have one picture, taken a little while\nbefore he was married. He was a moody, silent man, who hardly ever spoke\nto any one. I know now that he was broken-hearted. I can't remember even\nthe tones of his voice, but only one or two little peculiarities. He\ncouldn't bear the smell of lavender and the sight of any shade of purple\nactually made him suffer. It was very strange.\n\n\"I've picked up what education I have,\" he went on. \"I have nothing to\ngive you, Ruth, but these--\" he held out his hands--\"and my heart.\"\n\n\"That's all I want, dearest--don't tell me any more!\"\n\nA bell rang cheerily, and, when they went in, Aunt Jane welcomed him\nwith apparent cordiality, though a close observer might have detected\na tinge of suspicion. She liked the ring on Ruth's finger, which she\nnoticed for the first time. \"It's real pretty, ain't it, James?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"Yes'm, 't is so.\"\n\n\"It's just come to my mind now that you never give me no ring except\nthis here one we was married with. I guess we'd better take some of that\ntwo hundred dollars you've got sewed up in that unchristian belt you\ninsist on wearin' and get me a ring like Ruth's, and use the rest for\nfurniture, don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Yes'm,\" he replied. \"Ring and furniture--or anythin' you'd like.\"\n\n\"James is real indulgent,\" she said to Winfield, with a certain modest\npride which was at once ludicrous and pathetic.\n\n\"He should be, Mrs. Ball,\" returned the young man, gallantly.\n\nShe looked at him closely, as if to discover whether he was in earnest,\nbut he did not flinch. \"Young feller,\" she said, \"you ain't layin' out\nto take no excursions on the water, be you?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" he answered, \"why?\"\n\n\"Sea-farin' is dangerous,\" she returned.\n\n\"Mis' Ball was terrible sea sick comin' here,\" remarked her husband.\n\"She didn't seem to have no sea legs, as you may say.\"\n\n\"Ain't you tired of dwellin' on that?\" asked Aunt Jane, sharply. \"'T\nain't no disgrace to be sea sick, and I wan't the only one.\"\n\nWinfield came to the rescue with a question and the troubled waters\nwere soon calm again. After supper, Ruth said: \"Aunty, may I take Mr.\nWinfield up to the attic and show him my grandmother's things that\nyou've just given me?\"\n\n\"Run along, child. Me and James will wash the dishes.\"\n\n\"Poor James,\" said Winfield, in a low tone, as they ascended the stairs.\n\"Do I have to wash dishes, Ruth?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't surprise me. You said you wanted to work for me, and I\ndespise dishes.\"\n\n\"Then we'll get an orphan to do 'em. I'm not fitted for it, and I don't\nthink you are.\"\n\n\"Say, isn't this great!\" he exclaimed, as they entered the attic.\n\"Trunks, cobwebs, and old furniture! Why have I never been here before?\"\n\n\"It wasn't proper,\" replied Ruth, primly, with a sidelong glance at him.\n\"No, go away!\"\n\nThey dragged the furniture out into the middle of the room and looked it\nover critically. There was all that she had described, and unsuspected\ntreasure lay in concealment behind it. \"There's almost enough to furnish\na flat!\" she cried, in delight.\n\nHe was opening the drawers of a cabinet, which stood far back under the\neaves. \"What's this, Ruth?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's old blue china--willow pattern! How rich we are!\"\n\n\"Is old blue willow-pattern china considered beautiful?\"\n\n\"Of course it is, you goose! We'll have to have our dining-room done in\nold blue, now, with a shelf on the wall for these plates.\"\n\n\"Why can't we have a red dining-room?\"\n\n\"Because it would be a fright. You can have a red den, if you like.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he answered, \"but it seems to me it would be simpler and\nsave a good deal of expense, if we just pitched the plates into the sad\nsea. I don't think much of 'em.\"\n\n\"That's because you're not educated, dearest,\" returned Ruth, sweetly.\n\"When you're married, you'll know a great deal more about china--you see\nif you don't.\"\n\nThey lingered until it was so dark that they could scarcely see each\nother's faces. \"We'll come up again to-morrow,\" she said. \"Wait a\nminute.\"\n\nShe groped over to the east window, where there was still a faint glow,\nand lighted the lamp, which stood in its accustomed place, newly filled.\n\n\"You're not going to leave it burning, are you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, Aunt Jane has a light in this window every night.\"\n\n\"Why, what for?\"\n\n\"I don't know, dearest. I think it's for a lighthouse, but I don't care.\nCome, let's go downstairs.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIV. \"For Remembrance\"\n\nThe next day, while Ruth was busily gathering up her few belongings and\npacking her trunk, Winfield appeared with a suggestion regarding the\nadvisability of outdoor exercise. Uncle James stood at the gate and\nwatched them as they went down hill. He was a pathetic old figure,\npredestined to loneliness under all circumstances.\n\n\"That's the way I'll look when we've been married a few years,\" said\nCarl.\n\n\"Worse than that,\" returned Ruth, gravely. \"I'm sorry for you, even\nnow.\"\n\n\"You needn't be proud and haughty just because you've had a wedding at\nyour house--we're going to have one at ours.\"\n\n\"At ours?\"\n\n\"At the 'Widder's,' I mean, this very evening.\"\n\n\"That's nice,\" answered Ruth, refusing to ask the question.\n\n\"It's Joe and Hepsey,\" he continued, \"and I thought perhaps you might\nstoop low enough to assist me in selecting an appropriate wedding gift\nin yonder seething mart. I feel greatly indebted to them.\"\n\n\"Why, of course I will; it's quite sudden, isn't it?\" \"Far be it from\nme to say so. However, it's the most reversed wedding I ever heard of.\nA marriage at the home of the groom, to say the least, is unusual.\nMoreover, the 'Widder' Pendleton is to take the bridal tour and leave\nthe happy couple at home. She's going to visit a relative who is distant\nin both position and relationship--all unknown to the relative, I fancy.\nShe starts immediately after the ceremony and it seems to me that it\nwould be a pious notion to throw rice and old shoes after her.\"\n\n\"Why, Carl! You don't want to maim her, do you?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't mind. If it hadn't been for my ostrich-like digestion, I\nwouldn't have had anything to worry about by this time. However, if you\ninsist, I will throw the rice and let you heave the shoes. If you have\nthe precision of aim which distinguishes your sex, the 'Widder' will\nescape uninjured.\"\n\n\"Am I to be invited?\"\n\n\"Certainly--haven't I already invited you?\"\n\n\"They may not like it.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make any difference. Lots of people go to weddings who\naren't wanted.\"\n\n\"I'll go, then,\" announced Ruth, \"and once again, I give you my gracious\npermission to kiss the bride.\"\n\n\"Thank you, dear, but I'm not going to kiss any brides except my own.\nI've signed the pledge and sworn off.\"\n\nThey created a sensation in the village when they acquired the set of\nchina which had been on exhibition over a year. During that time it had\nfallen at least a third in price, though its value was unchanged. Ruth\nbought a hideous red table-cloth, which she knew would please Hepsey,\ngreatly to Winfield's disgust.\n\n\"Why do you do that?\" he demanded. \"Don't you know that, in all\nprobability, I'll have to eat off of it? I much prefer the oilcloth, to\nwhich I am now accustomed.\"\n\n\"You'll have to get used to table linen, dear,\" she returned teasingly;\n\"it's my ambition to have one just like this for state occasions.\"\n\nJoe appeared with the chariot just in time to receive and transport\nthe gift. \"Here's your wedding present, Joe!\" called Winfield, and\nthe innocent villagers formed a circle about them as the groom-elect\nendeavoured to express his appreciation. Winfield helped him pack the\n\"101 pieces\" on the back seat and under it, and when Ruth, feeling like\na fairy godmother, presented the red table-cloth, his cup of joy was\nfull.\n\nHe started off proudly, with a soup tureen and two platters on the seat\nbeside him. The red table-cloth was slung over his arm, in toreador\nfashion, and the normal creak of the conveyance was accentuated by an\nominous rattle of crockery. Then he circled back, motioning them to\nwait.\n\n\"Here's sunthin' I most forgot,\" he said, giving Ruth a note. \"I'd drive\nyou back fer nothin', only I've got sech a load.\"\n\nThe note was from Miss Ainslie, inviting Miss Thorne and her friend to\ncome at five o'clock and stay to tea. No answer was expected unless she\ncould not come.\n\nThe quaint, old-fashioned script was in some way familiar. A flash\nof memory took Ruth back to the note she had found in the dresser\ndrawer, beginning: \"I thank you from my heart for understanding me.\" So\nit was Miss Ainslie who had sent the mysterious message to Aunt Jane.\n\n\"You're not paying any attention to me,\" complained Winfield. \"I\nsuppose, when we're married, I'll have to write out what I want to say\nto you, and put it on file.\"\n\n\"You're a goose,\" laughed Ruth. \"We're going to Miss Ainslie's to-night\nfor tea. Aren't we getting gay?\"\n\n\"Indeed we are! Weddings and teas follow one another like Regret on the\nheels of Pleasure.\"\n\n\"Pretty simile,\" commented Ruth. \"If we go to the tea, we'll have to\nmiss the wedding.\"\n\n\"Well, we've been to a wedding quite recently, so I suppose it's\nbetter to go to the tea. Perhaps, by arranging it, we might be given\nnourishment at both places--not that I pine for the 'Widder's' cooking.\nAnyhow, we've sent our gift, and they'd rather have that than to have\nus, if they were permitted to choose.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose they'll give us anything?\"\n\n\"Let us hope not.\"\n\n\"I don't believe we want any at all,\" she said. \"Most of them would be\nin bad taste, and you'd have to bury them at night, one at a time, while\nI held a lantern.\"\n\n\"The policeman on the beat would come and ask us what we were doing,\"\nhe objected; \"and when we told him we were only burying our wedding\npresents, he wouldn't believe us. We'd be dragged to the station and\nput into a noisome cell. Wouldn't it make a pretty story for the morning\npapers! The people who gave us the things would enjoy it over their\ncoffee.\"\n\n\"It would be pathetic, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"It would, Miss Thorne. I think we'd better not tell anybody until its\nall safely over, and then we can have a little card printed to go\nwith the announcement, saying that if anybody is inclined to give us a\npresent, we'd rather have the money.\"\n\n\"You're a very practical person, Carl. One would think you had been\nmarried several times.\"\n\n\"We'll be married as often as you like, dear. Judging by your respected\naunt, one ceremony isn't 'rightfully bindin', and I want it done often\nenough to be sure that you can't get away from me.\"\n\nAs they entered the gate, Uncle James approached stealthily by a\nroundabout way and beckoned to them. \"Excuse me,\" he began, as they came\nwithin speaking distance, \"but has Mis' Ball give you furniture?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ruth, in astonishment, \"why?\"\n\n\"There's clouds to starboard and she's repentin'. She's been admirin'\nof it the hull mornin' in the attic. I was sot in the kitchen with\npertaters,\" he explained, \"but the work is wearin' and a feller needs\nfresh air.\"\n\n\"Thank you for the tip, Uncle,\" said Winfield, heartily.\n\nThe old man glowed with gratification. \"We men understand each other,\"\nwas plainly written on his expressive face, as he went noiselessly back\nto the kitchen.\n\n\"You'd better go home, dear,\" suggested Ruth.\n\n\"Delicate hint,\" replied Winfield. \"It would take a social strategist\nto perceive your hidden meaning. Still, my finer sensibilities respond\ninstantly to your touch, and I will go. I flatter myself that I've never\nhad to be put out yet, when I've been calling on a girl. Some subtle\nsuggestion like yours has always been sufficient.\"\n\n\"Don't be cross, dear--let's see how soon you can get to the bottom of\nthe hill. You can come back at four o'clock.\"\n\nHe laughed and turned back to wave his hand at her. She wafted a kiss\nfrom the tips of her fingers, which seemed momentarily to impede his\nprogress, but she motioned him away and ran into the house.\n\nAunt Jane was nowhere to be seen, so she went on into the kitchen to\nhelp Uncle James with the potatoes. He had peeled almost a peck and the\nthick parings lay in a heap on the floor. \"My goodness'\" she exclaimed.\n\"You'd better throw those out, Uncle, and I'll put the potatoes on to\nboil.\"\n\nHe hastened out, with his arms full of peelings. \"You're a real kind\nwoman, Niece Ruth,\" he said gratefully, when he came in. \"You don't\nfavour your aunt none--I think you're more like me.\"\n\nMrs. Ball entered the kitchen with a cloud upon her brow, and in one of\nthose rare flashes of insight which are vouchsafed to plodding mortals,\na plan of action presented itself to Ruth. \"Aunty,\" she said, before\nMrs. Ball had time to speak, \"you know I'm going back to the city\nto-morrow, and I'd like to send you and Uncle James a wedding\npresent--you've been so good to me. What shall it be?\"\n\n\"Well, now, I don't know,\" she answered, visibly softening, \"but I'll\nthink it over, and let you know.\"\n\n\"What would you like, Uncle James?\"\n\n\"You needn't trouble him about it,\" explained his wife. \"He'll like\nwhatever I do, won't you, James?\"\n\n\"Yes'm, just as you say.\"\n\nAfter dinner, when Ruth broached the subject of furniture, she was\ngratified to find that Aunt Jane had no serious objections. \"I kinder\nhate to part with it, Ruth,\" she said, \"but in a way, as you may say,\nit's yours.\"\n\n\"'Tisn't like giving it away, Aunty--it's all in the family, and, as you\nsay, you're not using it.\"\n\n\"That's so, and then James and me are likely to come and make you a long\nvisit, so I'll get the good of it, too.\"\n\nRuth was momentarily stunned, but rallied enough to express great\npleasure at the prospect. As Aunt Jane began to clear up the dishes,\nMr. Ball looked at his niece, with a certain quiet joy, and then,\nunmistakably, winked.\n\n\"When you decide about the wedding present, Aunty, let me know, won't\nyou?\" she asked, as Mrs. Ball came in after the rest of the dishes. \"Mr.\nWinfield would like to send you a remembrance also.\" Then Ruth added, to\nher conscience, \"I know he would.\"\n\n\"He seems like a pleasant-spoken feller,\" remarked Aunt Jane. \"You can\nask him to supper to-night, if you like.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Aunty, but we're going to Miss Ainslie's.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" snorted Mrs. Ball. \"Mary Ainslie ain't got no sperrit!\" With this\nenigmatical statement, she sailed majestically out of the room.\n\nDuring the afternoon, Ruth finished her packing, leaving out a white\nshirt-waist to wear to Miss Ainslie's. When she went down to the parlour\nto wait for Winfield, Aunt Jane appeared, with her husband in her wake.\n\n\"Ruth,\" she announced, \"me and James have decided on a weddin' present.\nI would like a fine linen table-cloth and a dozen napkins.\"\n\n\"All right, Aunty.\"\n\n\"And if Mr. Winfield is disposed to it, he can give me a lemonade\nset--one of them what has different coloured tumblers belongin' to it.\"\n\n\"He'll be pleased to send it, Aunty; I know he will.\"\n\n\"I'm a-layin' out to take part of them two hundred dollars what's sewed\nup in James's belt, and buy me a new black silk,\" she went on. \"I've got\nsome real lace to trim it with, whet dames give me in the early years of\nour engagement. Don't you think a black silk is allers nice, Ruth?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is, Aunty; and just now, it's very stylish.\"\n\n\"You appear to know about such things. I guess I'll let you get it\nfor me in the city when you buy the weddin' present. I'll give you the\nmoney, and you can get the linin's too, while you're about it.\"\n\n\"I'll send you some samples, Aunty, and then you can take your choice.\"\n\n\"And--\" began Mrs. Ball.\n\n\"Did you know Mrs. Pendleton was going away, Aunty?\" asked Ruth,\nhastily.\n\n\"Do tell! Elmiry Peavey goin' travellin'?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's going somewhere for a visit--I don't know just where.\"\n\n\"I had laid out to take James and call on Elmiry,\" she said, stroking\nher apron thoughtfully, while a shadow crossed Mr. Ball's expressive\nface; \"but I guess I'll wait now till I get my new black silk. I want\nher to know I've done well.\"\n\nA warning hiss from the kitchen and the odour of burning sugar impelled\nAunt Jane to a hasty exit just as Winfield came. Uncle James followed\nthem to the door.\n\n\"Niece Ruth,\" he said, hesitating and fumbling at his belt, \"be you\ngoin' to get merried?\"\n\n\"I hope so, Uncle,\" she replied kindly.\n\n\"Then--then--I wish you'd take this and buy you sunthin' to remember\nyour pore old Uncle James by.\" He thrust a trembling hand toward her,\nand offered her a twenty dollar bill.\n\n\"Why, Uncle!\" she exclaimed. \"I mustn't take this! Thank you ever so\nmuch, but it isn't right!\"\n\n\"I'd be pleased,\" he said plaintively. \"'Taint as if I wan's accustomed\nto money. My store was wuth five or six hundred dollars, and you've been\nreal pleasant to me, Niece Ruth. Buy a hair wreath for the parlour, or\nsunthin' to remind you of your pore old Uncle.\"\n\nWinfield pressed her arm warningly, and she tucked the bill into her\nchatelaine bag. \"Thank you, Uncle!\" she said; then, of her own accord,\nshe stooped and kissed him lightly on the cheek.\n\nA mist came into the old man's eyes, and he put his hand to his belt\nagain, but she hurriedly led Winfield away. \"Ruth,\" he said, as they\nwent down the hill, \"you're a sweet girl. That was real womanly kindness\nto the poor devil.\"\n\n\"Shall I be equally kind to all 'poor devils'?\"\n\n\"There's one more who needs you--if you attend to him properly, it will\nbe enough.\"\n\n\"I don't see how they're going to get Aunty's silk gown and a ring like\nmine and a haircloth parlour suit and publish a book with less than two\nhundred dollars, do you?\"\n\n\"Hardly--Joe says that he gave Hepsey ten dollars. There's a great\ndiscussion about the spending of it.\"\n\n\"I didn't know--I feel guilty.\"\n\n\"You needn't, darling. There was nothing else for you to do. How did you\nsucceed with your delicate mission?\"\n\n\"I managed it,\" she said proudly. \"I feel that I was originally destined\nfor a diplomatic career.\" He laughed when she described the lemonade set\nwhich she had promised in his name.\n\n\"I'll see that the furniture is shipped tomorrow,\" he assured her; \"and\nthen I'll go on a still hunt for the gaudy glassware. I'm blessed if I\ndon't give 'em a silver ice pitcher, too.\"\n\n\"I'm in for a table-cloth and a dozen napkins,\" laughed Ruth; \"but I\ndon't mind. We won't bury Uncle's wedding present, will we?\"\n\n\"I should say not! Behold the effect of the card, long before it's\nprinted.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Ruth, seriously, \"I'll get a silver spoon or something\nlike that out of the twenty dollars, and then I'll spend the rest of\nit on something nice for Uncle James. The poor soul isn't getting any\nwedding present, and he'll never know.\"\n\n\"There's a moral question involved in that,\" replied Winfield. \"Is it\nright to use his money in that way and assume the credit yourself?\"\n\n\"We'll have to think it over,\" Ruth answered. \"It isn't so very simple\nafter all.\"\n\n\nMiss Ainslie was waiting for them in the garden and came to the gate to\nmeet them. She wore a gown of lavender taffeta, which rustled and shone\nin the sunlight. The skirt was slightly trained, with a dust ruffle\nunderneath, and the waist was made in surplice fashion, open at the\nthroat. A bertha of rarest Brussels lace was fastened at her neck with\nthe amethyst pin, inlaid with gold and surrounded by baroque pearls. The\nends of the bertha hung loosely and under it she had tied an apron of\nsheerest linen, edged with narrow Duchesse lace. Her hair was coiled\nsoftly on top of her head, with a string of amethysts and another of\npearls woven among the silvery strands.\n\n\"Welcome to my house,\" she said, smiling, Winfield at once became her\nslave. She talked easily, with that exquisite cadence which makes each\nword seem like a gift, but there was a certain subtle excitement in\nher manner, which Ruth did not fail to perceive. When Winfield was\nnot looking at Miss Ainslie, her eyes rested upon him with a wondering\nhunger, mingled with tenderness and fear.\n\nMidsummer lay upon the garden and the faint odour of mignonette\nand lavender came with every wandering wind. White butterflies and\nthistledown floated in the air, bees hummed drowsily, and the stately\nhollyhocks swayed slowly back and forth.\n\n\"Do you know why I asked you to come today?\" She spoke to Ruth, but\nlooked at Winfield.\n\n\"Why, Miss Ainslie?\"\n\n\"Because it is my birthday--I am fifty-five years old.\"\n\nRuth's face mirrored her astonishment. \"You don't look any older than I\ndo,\" she said.\n\nExcept for the white hair, it was true. Her face was as fresh as a rose\nwith the morning dew upon it, and even on her neck, where the folds of\nlace revealed a dazzling whiteness, there were no lines.\n\n\"Teach us how to live, Miss Ainslie,\" said Winfield, softly, \"that the\nend of half a century may find us young.\"\n\nA delicate pink suffused her cheeks and she turned her eyes to his.\n\"I've just been happy, that's all,\" she answered.\n\n\"It needs the alchemist's touch,\" he said, \"to change our sordid world\nto gold.\"\n\n\"We can all learn,\" she replied, \"and even if we don't try, it comes to\nus once.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Ruth.\n\n\"Happiness--even if it isn't until the end. In every life there is a\nperfect moment, like a flash of sun. We can shape our days by that, if\nwe will--before by faith, and afterward by memory.\"\n\nThe conversation drifted to less serious things. Ruth, remembering\nthat Miss Ainslie did not hear the village gossip, described her aunt's\nhome-coming, the dismissal of Hepsey, and told her of the wedding which\nwas to take place that evening. Winfield was delighted, for he had\nnever heard her talk so well, but Miss Ainslie listened with gentle\ndispleasure.\n\n\"I did not think Miss Hathaway would ever be married abroad,\" she said.\n\"I think she should have waited until she came home. It would have been\nmore delicate to let him follow her. To seem to pursue a gentleman,\nhowever innocent one may be, is--is unmaidenly.\"\n\nWinfield choked, then coughed violently.\n\n\"Understand me, dear,\" Miss Ainslie went on, \"I do not mean to criticise\nyour aunt--she is one of my dearest friends. Perhaps I should not have\nspoken at all,\" she concluded in genuine distress.\n\n\"It's all right, Miss Ainslie,\" Ruth assured her, \"I know just how you\nfeel.\"\n\nWinfield, having recovered his composure, asked a question about the\ngarden, and Miss Ainslie led them in triumph around her domain. She\ngathered a little nosegay of sweet-williams for Ruth, who was over among\nthe hollyhocks, then she said shyly: \"What shall I pick for you?\"\n\n\"Anything you like, Miss Ainslie. I am at a loss to choose.\"\n\nShe bent over and plucked a leaf of rosemary, looking at him long and\nsearchingly as she put it into his hand.\n\n\"For remembrance,\" she said, with the deep fire burning in her eyes.\nThen she added, with a pitiful hunger in her voice:\n\n\"Whatever happens, you won't forget me?\"\n\n\"Never!\" he answered, strangely stirred.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she whispered brokenly, drawing away from him. \"You look so\nmuch like--like some one I used to know.\"\n\nAt dusk they went into the house. Except for the hall, it was square,\nwith two partitions dividing it. The two front rooms were separated by\nan arch, and the dining-room and kitchen were similarly situated at the\nback of the house, with a china closet and pantry between them.\n\nMiss Ainslie's table, of solid mahogany, was covered only with fine\nlinen doilies, after a modern fashion, and two quaint candlesticks, of\nsolid silver, stood opposite each other. In the centre, in a silver vase\nof foreign pattern, there was a great bunch of asters--white and pink\nand blue.\n\nThe repast was simple--chicken fried to a golden brown, with creamed\npotatoes, a salad made of fresh vegetables from the garden, hot\nbiscuits, deliciously light, and the fragrant Chinese tea, served in the\nRoyal Kaga cups, followed by pound cake, and pears preserved in a heavy\nred syrup.\n\nThe hostess sat at the head of the table, dispensing a graceful\nhospitality. She made no apology, such as prefaced almost every meal at\nAunt Jane's. It was her best, and she was proud to give it--such was the\nimpression.\n\nAfterward, when Ruth told her that she was going back to the city, Miss\nAinslie's face grew sad.\n\n\"Why--why must you go?\" she asked.\n\n\"I'm interrupting the honeymoon,\" Ruth answered, \"and when I suggested\ndeparture, Aunty agreed to it immediately. I can't very well stay now,\ncan I?\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Miss Ainslie, laying her hand upon Ruth's, \"if you\ncould, if you only would--won't you come and stay with me?\"\n\n\"I'd love to,\" replied Ruth, impetuously, \"but are you sure you want\nme?\"\n\n\"Believe me, my dear,\" said Miss Ainslie, simply, \"it will give me great\nhappiness.\"\n\nSo it was arranged that the next day Ruth's trunk should be taken to\nMiss Ainslie's, and that she would stay until the first of October.\nWinfield was delighted, since it brought Ruth nearer to him and involved\nno long separation.\n\nThey went outdoors again, where the crickets and katydids were chirping\nin the grass, and the drowsy twitter of birds came from the maples\nabove. The moon, at its full, swung slowly over the hill, and threads of\nsilver light came into the fragrant dusk of the garden. Now and then the\nmoonlight shone full upon Miss Ainslie's face, touching her hair as if\nwith loving tenderness and giving her an unearthly beauty. It was the\nface of a saint.\n\nWinfield, speaking reverently, told her of their betrothal. She leaned\nforward, into the light, and put one hand caressingly upon the arm of\neach.\n\n\"I am so glad,\" she said, with her face illumined. Through the music of\nher voice ran lights and shadows, vague, womanly appeal, and a haunting\nsweetness neither could ever forget.\n\nThat night, the gates of Youth turned on their silent hinges for Miss\nAinslie. Forgetting the hoary frost that the years had laid upon her\nhair, she walked, hand in hand with them, through the clover fields\nwhich lay fair before them and by the silvered reaches of the River of\nDreams. Into their love came something sweet that they had not found\nbefore--the absolute need of sharing life together, whether it should be\njoy or pain. Unknowingly, they rose to that height which makes sacrifice\nthe soul's dearest offering, as the chrysalis, brown and unbeautiful,\ngives the radiant creature within to the light and freedom of day.\n\nWhen the whistle sounded for the ten o'clock train, Ruth said it was\nlate and they must go. Miss Ainslie went to the gate with them, her\nlavender scented gown rustling softly as she walked, and the moonlight\nmaking new beauty of the amethysts and pearls entwined in her hair.\n\nRuth, aglow with happiness, put her arms around Miss Ainslie's neck and\nkissed her tenderly. \"May I, too?\" asked Winfield.\n\nHe drew her toward him, without waiting for an answer, and Miss Ainslie\ntrembled from head to foot as she lifted her face to his.\n\nAcross the way the wedding was in full blast, but neither of them cared\nto go. Ruth turned back for a last glimpse of the garden and its gentle\nmistress, but she was gone, and the light from her candle streamed out\nuntil it rested upon a white hollyhock, nodding drowsily.\n\nTo Ruth, walking in the starlight with her lover, it seemed as if the\nworld had been made new. The spell was upon Winfield for a long time,\nbut at last he spoke.\n\n\"If I could have chosen my mother,\" he said, simply, \"she would have\nbeen like Miss Ainslie.\"\n\n\n\n\nXV. The Secret and the Dream\n\nRuth easily became accustomed to the quiet life at Miss Ainslie's, and\ngradually lost all desire to go back to the city. \"You're spoiling me,\"\nshe said, one day. \"I don't want to go back to town, I don't want to\nwork, I don't want to do anything but sit still and look at you. I\ndidn't know I was so lazy.\"\n\n\"You're not lazy, dear,\" answered Miss Ainslie, \"you were tired, and you\ndidn't know how tired you were.\"\n\nWinfield practically lived there. In the morning, he sat in the garden,\nreading the paper, while Ruth helped about the house. She insisted\nupon learning to cook, and he ate many an unfamiliar dish, heroically\nproclaiming that it was good. \"You must never doubt his love,\" Miss\nAinslie said, \"for those biscuits--well, dear, you know they were--were\nnot just right.\"\n\nThe amateur cook laughed outright at the gentle criticism. \"They were\nawful,\" she admitted, \"but I'm going to keep at it until I learn how.\"\n\nThe upper part of the house was divided into four rooms, with windows on\nall sides. One of the front rooms, with north and east windows, was Miss\nAinslie's, while the one just back of it, with south and east windows,\nwas a sitting-room.\n\n\"I keep my prettiest things up here, dear,\" she explained to Ruth, \"for\nI don't want people to think I'm crazy.\" Ruth caught her breath as she\nentered the room, for rare tapestries hung on the walls and priceless\nrugs lay on the floor. The furniture, like that downstairs, was colonial\nmahogany, highly polished, with here and there a chair or table of\nforeign workmanship. There was a cabinet, filled with rare china, a\nmarquetry table, and a chair of teakwood, inlaid with mother of pearl.\nIn one corner of the room was a large chest of sandal wood, inlaid with\npearl and partly covered by a wonderful antique rug.\n\nThe world had seemingly given up its beauty to adorn Miss Ainslie's\nroom. She had pottery from Mexico, China and Japan; strange things from\nEgypt and the Nile, and all the Oriental splendour of India and\nPersia. Ruth wisely asked no questions, but once, as before, she said\nhesitating; \"they were given to me by a--a friend.\"\n\nAfter much pleading on Ruth's part, Winfield was allowed to come to the\nsitting room. \"He'll think I'm silly, dear,\" she said, flushing; but, on\nthe contrary, he shared Ruth's delight, and won Miss Ainslie's gratitude\nby his appreciation of her treasures.\n\nDay by day, the singular attraction grew between them. She loved Ruth,\nbut she took him unreservedly into her heart. Ruth observed, idly, that\nshe never called him \"Mr. Winfield.\" At first she spoke of him as \"your\nfriend\" and afterward, when he had asked her to, she yielded, with an\nadorable shyness, and called him Carl.\n\nHe, too, had eaten of the lotus and lost the desire to go back to town.\nFrom the hilltop they could see the yellow fields and hear the soft\nmelody of reaping from the valley around them. He and Ruth often walked\ntogether, but Miss Ainslie never would go with them. She stayed quietly\nat home, as she had done for many years.\n\nEvery night, when the last train came from the city, she put a lighted\ncandle in her front window, using always the candlestick of solid\nsilver, covered with fretwork in intricate design. If Winfield was\nthere, she managed to have him and Ruth in another room. At half-past\nten, she took it away, sighing softly as she put out the light.\n\nRuth wondered, but said nothing, even to Winfield. The grain in\nthe valley was bound in sheaves, and the first colour came on the\nmaples--sometimes in a delicate flush, or a flash of gold, and sometimes\nlike a blood-red wound.\n\nOne morning, when Miss Ainslie came downstairs, Ruth was startled at\nthe change in her. The quick, light step was slow and heavy, the broad,\nstraight shoulders drooped a little, and her face, while still dimpled\nand fair, was subtly different. Behind her deep, violet eyes lay an\nunspeakable sadness and the rosy tints were gone. Her face was as pure\nand cold as marble, with the peace of the dead laid upon it. She seemed\nto have grown old in a single night.\n\nAll day she said little or nothing and would not eat. She simply sat\nstill, looking out of the east window. \"No,\" she said, gently, to Ruth,\n\"nothing is the matter, deary, I'm just tired.\"\n\nWhen Winfield came, she kept him away from Miss Ainslie without seeming\nto do so. \"Let's go for a walk,\" she said. She tried to speak lightly,\nbut there was a lump in her throat and a tightening at her heart.\n\nThey climbed the hill and took the side path which led to the woods,\nfollowing it down and through the aisles of trees, to the log across the\npath. Ruth was troubled and sat there some little time without speaking,\nthen suddenly, she knew that something was wrong with Carl.\n\nHer heart was filled with strange foreboding and she vainly tried to\nswallow the persistent lump in her throat. She spoke to him, gently,\nonce or twice and he did not seem to hear. \"Carl!\" she cried in agony,\n\"Carl! What is it?\"\n\nHe tried to shake off the spell which lay upon him. \"Nothing, darling,\"\nhe said unsteadily, with something of the old tenderness. \"I'm weak--and\nfoolish--that's all.\"\n\n\"Carl! Dearest!\" she cried, and then broke down, sobbing bitterly.\n\nHer tears aroused him and he tried to soothe her. \"Ruth, my darling\ngirl, don't cry. We have each other, sweetheart, and it doesn't\nmatter--nothing matters in the whole, wide world.\"\n\nAfter a little, she regained her self-control.\n\n\"Come out into the sun,\" he said, \"it's ghostly here. You don't seem\nreal to me, Ruth.\"\n\nThe mist filled her eyes again. \"Don't, darling,\" he pleaded, \"I'll try\nto tell you.\"\n\nThey sat down on the hillside, where the sun shone brightly, and where\nthey could see Miss Ainslie's house plainly. She waited, frightened and\nsuffering, for what seemed an eternity, before he spoke.\n\n\"Last night, Ruth,\" he began, \"my father came to me in a dream. You know\nhe died when I was about twelve years old, and last night I saw him as\nhe would have been if he had lived until now--something over sixty. His\nhair and beard were matted and there was the most awful expression in\nhis eyes--it makes me shudder yet. He was in his grave clothes, dead and\nyet not dead. He was suffering--there was something he was trying to say\nto me; something he wanted to explain. We were out here on the hill in\nthe moonlight and I could see Miss Ainslie's house and hear the\nsurf behind the cliff. All he could say to me was:\n'Abby--Mary--Mary--Abby--she--Mary,' over and over again. Once he said\n'mother.' Abby was my mother's name.\n\n\"It is terrible,\" he went on. \"I can't understand it. There is something\nI must do, and I don't know what it is. A command is laid on me by the\ndead--there is some wrong for which I must atone. When I first awoke, I\nthought it was a dream, but it isn't, it's real. It seems as though that\nwas the real world, and this--all our love and happiness, and you, were\njust dreams. I can't bear it, Ruth!\"\n\nHe shuddered, and she tried to comfort him, though she was cold as a\nmarble statue and her lips moved with difficulty. \"Don't, dear,\" she\nsaid, \"It was only a dream. I've had them sometimes, so vividly that\nthey haunted me for days and, as you say, it seemed as if that was the\nreal world and this the dream. I know how you feel--those things aren't\npleasant, but there's nothing we can do. It makes one feel so helpless.\nThe affairs of the day are largely under our control, but at night,\nwhen the body is asleep, the mind harks back to things that have been\nforgotten for years. It takes a fevered fancy as a fact, and builds\nupon it a whole series of disasters. It gives trivial things great\nsignificance and turns life upside down. Remembering it is the worst of\nall.\"\n\n\"There's something I can't get at, Ruth,\" he answered. \"It's just out of\nmy reach. I know it's reasonable to suppose it was a dream and that it\ncan be explained by natural causes, but I don't dream very often.\"\n\n\"I dream every night,\" she said. \"Sometimes they're just silly, foolish\nthings and sometimes they're vivid and horrible realities that I can't\nforget for weeks. But, surely, dear, we're not foolish enough to believe\nin dreams?\"\n\n\"No, I hope not,\" he replied, doubtfully.\n\n\"Let's go for a little walk,\" she said, \"and we'll forget it.\"\n\nThen she told him how changed Miss Ainslie was and how she had left her,\nsitting aimlessly by the window. \"I don't think I'd better stay away\nlong,\" she concluded, \"she may need me.\"\n\n\"I won't be selfish, Ruth; we'll go back now. I'm sorry Miss Ainslie\nisn't well.\"\n\n\"She said she was 'just tired' but it isn't like her to be tired. She\ndoesn't seem to want anybody near her, but you can sit in the garden\nthis afternoon, if you'd like to, and I'll flit in and out like an\nindustrious butterfly. Some new books have just come, and I'll leave\nthem in the arbour for you.\"\n\n\"All right, dear, and if there's anything I can do, I hope you'll tell\nme.\"\n\nAs they approached the house, a brisk little man hurried out of the gate\nand went toward the village.\n\n\"Who's that?\" asked Winfield.\n\n\"I don't know--some one who has brought something, probably. I trust\nshe's better.\"\n\nMiss Ainslie seemed more like herself, as she moved about the house,\ndusting and putting the rooms in order, as was her wont. At noon she\nfried a bit of chicken for Ruth, but took nothing herself except a cup\nof tea.\n\n\"No, deary,\" she said, in answer to Ruth's anxious question, \"I'm all\nright--don't fret about me.\" \"Have you any pain, Miss Ainslie?\"\n\n\"No, of course I haven't, you foolish child!\"\n\nShe tried to smile, but her white lips quivered pitifully.\n\nIn the afternoon, when she said she was cold, Ruth made a fire in the\nopen fireplace, and wheeled Miss Ainslie's favourite chair in front of\nit. She drew her shawl about her shoulders and leaned back.\n\n\"I'm so comfortable, now,\" she said drowsily; \"I think I'm going to\nsleep, dear.\"\n\nRuth sat by her, pretending to read, but, in reality, watching her\nclosely, until the deep, regular breathing assured her that she was\nasleep. She went out into the garden and found Winfield in the arbour.\n\n\"How's this patient?\" she asked, kissing him lightly on the forehead.\n\n\"I'm all right, dearest,\" he answered, drawing her down beside him, \"and\nI'm ashamed of myself because I was so foolish.\"\n\nDuring the afternoon Ruth made frequent trips to the house, each time\nfinding Miss Ainslie sound asleep. It was after six o'clock when she\nwoke and rubbed her eyes, wonderingly.\n\n\"How long have I been asleep, Ruth?\"\n\n\"All the afternoon, Miss Ainslie--do you feel better now?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I do. I didn't sleep last night, but it's been years since\nI've taken a nap in the daytime.\"\n\nRuth invited Carl to supper, and made them both sit still while she\nprepared the simple meal, which, as he said, was \"astonishingly good.\"\nHe was quite himself again, but Miss Ainslie, though trying to assume\nher old manner, had undergone a great change.\n\nCarl helped Ruth with the dishes, saying he supposed he might as well\nbecome accustomed to it, and, feeling the need of sleep, went home very\nearly.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he said to Ruth, as he kissed her at the door, \"and\nyou're just the sweetest girl in the world. Good night, darling.\"\n\nA chill mist came inland, and Ruth kept pine knots burning in the\nfireplace. They sat without other light, Miss Ainslie with her head\nresting upon her hand, and Ruth watching her narrowly. Now and then they\nspoke aimlessly, of commonplaces.\n\nWhen the last train came in, Miss Ainslie raised her eyes to the silver\ncandlestick that stood on the mantel and sighed.\n\n\"Shall I put the light in the window?\" asked Ruth.\n\nIt was a long time before Miss Ainslie answered.\n\n\"No, deary,\" she said sadly, \"never any more.\"\n\nShe was trying to hide her suffering, and Ruth's heart ached for her in\nvain. The sound of the train died away in the distance and the firelight\nfaded.\n\n\"Ruth,\" she said, in a low voice, \"I am going away.\"\n\n\"Away, Miss Ainslie? Where?\"\n\n\"I don't know, dear--it's where we all go--'the undiscovered country\nfrom whose bourne no traveller returns.' Sometimes it's a long journey\nand sometimes a short one, but we all take it--alone--at the last.\"\n\nRuth's heart throbbed violently, then stood still.\n\n\"Don't!\" she cried, sharply.\n\n\"I'm not afraid, dear, and I'm ready to go, even though you have made me\nso happy--you and he.\"\n\nMiss Ainslie waited a moment, then continued, in a different tone:\n\n\"To-day the lawyer came and made my will. I haven't much--just this\nlittle house, a small income paid semi-annually, and my--my things. All\nmy things are for you--the house and the income are for--for him.\"\n\nRuth was crying softly and Miss Ainslie went to her, laying her hand\ncaressingly upon the bowed head. \"Don't, deary,\" she pleaded, \"don't be\nunhappy. I'm not afraid. I'm just going to sleep, that's all, to wake\nin immortal dawn. I want you and him to have my things, because I love\nyou--because I've always loved you, and because I will--even afterward.\"\n\nRuth choked down her sobs, and Miss Ainslie drew her chair closer,\ntaking the girl's cold hand in hers. That touch, so strong and gentle,\nthat had always brought balm to her troubled spirit, did not fail in its\nministry now.\n\n\"He went away,\" said Miss Ainslie, after a long silence, as if in\ncontinuation of something she had said before, \"and I was afraid. He had\nmade many voyages in safety, each one more successful than the last, and\nhe always brought me beautiful things, but, this time, I knew that it\nwas not right for him to go.\"\n\n\"When he came back, we were to be married.\" The firelight shone on the\namethyst ring as Miss Ainslie moved it on her finger. \"He said that he\nwould have no way of writing this time, but that, if anything happened,\nI would know. I was to wait--as women have waited since the world began.\n\n\"Oh, Ruth, do you know what waiting means? Mine has lasted through\nthirty-three interminable years. Each day, I have said: 'he will come\nto-morrow.' When the last train came in, I put the light in the window\nto lead him straight to me. Each day, I have made the house ready for an\ninvited guest and I haven't gone away, even for an hour. I couldn't bear\nto have him come and find no welcome waiting, and I have always worn\nthe colour he loved. When people have come to see me, I've always been\nafraid they would stay until he came, except with you--and Carl. I was\nglad to have you come to stay with me, because, lately, I have thought\nthat it would be more--more delicate than to have him find me alone. I\nloved you, too, dear,\" she added quickly.\n\n\"I--I asked your aunt to keep the light in the window. I never told her\nwhy, but I think she knew, and you must tell her, dear, the next time\nyou see her, that I thank her, and that she need never do it again. I\nthought, if he should come in a storm, or, perhaps, sail by, on his way\nto me--\"\n\nThere was another long silence, then, with an effort, she went on. \"I\nhave been happy, for he said he wanted me to be, though sometimes it was\nhard. As nearly as I could, I made my dream real. I have thought, for\nhours, of the things we would say to each other when the long years were\nover and we were together again. I have dressed for his eyes alone, and\nloved him--perhaps you know--\"\n\n\"I know, Miss Ainslie,\" said Ruth, softly, her own love surging in her\nheart, \"I know.\"\n\n\"He loved me, Ruth,\" she said, lingering upon the words, \"as man never\nloved before. In all of God's great universe, there was never anything\nlike that--even in Heaven, there can't be anything so beautiful, though\nwe have to know human love before we can understand God's. All day, I\nhave dreamed of our little home together, and at night, sometimes--of\nbaby lips against my breast. I could always see him plainly, but I never\ncould see our--our child. I have missed that. I have had more happiness\nthan comes to most women, but that has been denied me.\"\n\nShe leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes. Her lips were white\nand quivering, but there were no tears. At length she sat upright and\nfixed her eyes upon Ruth.\n\n\"Don't be afraid of anything,\" she said in a strange tone, \"poverty or\nsickness or death, or any suffering God will let you bear together. That\nisn't love--to be afraid. There's only one thing--the years! Oh, God,\nthe bitter, cruel, endless years!\"\n\nMiss Ainslie caught her breath and it sounded like a sob, but she\nbravely kept it back. \"I have been happy,\" she said, in pitiful triumph;\n\"I promised him that I would be, and I have kept my word. Sometimes it\nwas hard, but I had my dream. Lately, this last year, I have often been\nafraid that--that something had happened. Thirty-three years, and you\nknow, dear,\" she added, with a quaint primness, \"that I am a woman of\nthe world.\"\n\n\"In the world, but not of it,\" was on Ruth's lips, but she did not say\nit.\n\n\"Still, I know it was wrong to doubt him--I couldn't, when I thought of\nour last hour together, out on the hill in the moonlight. He said it was\nconceivable that life might keep him from me, but death never could. He\ntold me that if he died, I would know, that he would come and tell me,\nand that in a little while afterward, we should be together.\"\n\nThe dying embers cast a glow upon her face. It was almost waxen in its\npurity; she seemed transfigured with the light of another world. \"Last\nnight, he came to me--in a dream. He is dead--he has been dead for a\nlong time. He was trying to explain something to me--I suppose he was\ntrying to tell me why he had not come before. He was old--an old man,\nRuth, and I have always thought of him as young. He could not say\nanything but my name--'Mary--Abby--Mary--Abby--' over and over again;\nand, once, 'mother.' I was christened 'Mary Abigail,' but I never liked\nthe middle name, so I dropped it; and he used to tease me sometimes by\ncalling me 'Abby.' And--from his saying 'mother,' I know that he, too,\nwherever he may be, has had that dream of--of our child.\"\n\nRuth was cold from head to foot, and her senses reeled. Every word that\nWinfield had said in the morning sounded again in her ears. What was it\nthat went on around her, of which she had no ken? It seemed as though\nshe stood absolutely alone, in endless space, while planets swept past,\nout of their orbits, with all the laws of force set suddenly aside.\n\nMiss Ainslie felt her shuddering fear. \"Don't be afraid, dear,\" she said\nagain, \"everything is right. I kept my promise, and he kept his. He is\nsuffering--he is very lonely without me; but in a little while we shall\nbe together.\"\n\nThe fire died out and left the room in darkness, broken only by the last\nfitful glow. Ruth could not speak, and Miss Ainslie sat quietly in her\nchair. \"Come,\" she said at last, stretching out her hand, \"let's go\nupstairs. I have kept you up, deary, and I know you must be very tired.\"\n\nThe house seemed filled with a shadowy presence--something intangible,\nbut portentous, for both good and ill. Ruth took down the heavy mass of\nwhite hair and brushed it back, tying it at the neck with a ribbon, in\ngirlish fashion, as Miss Ainslie always did. Her night gown, of sheerest\nlinen, was heavy with Valenciennes lace, and where it fell back from her\nthroat, it revealed the flesh, exquisitely white, set in gracious curves\nand womanly softness, as if by a sculptor who loved his clay.\n\nThe sweet, wholesome scent of the lavender flowers breathed from the\nfolds of Miss Ainslie's gown, as she stood there in the candle light,\nsmiling, with the unearthly glow still upon her face.\n\n\"Good night, deary,\" she said; \"you'll kiss me, won't you?\"\n\nFor a moment the girl's face was buried among Miss Ainslie's laces, then\ntheir lips met. Ruth was trembling and she hurried away, swallowing the\nlump in her throat and trying to keep back the tears.\n\nThe doors were open, and there was no sound save Miss Ainslie's deep\nbreathing, but Ruth kept a dreary vigil till almost dawn.\n\n\n\n\nXVI. Some One Who Loved Her\n\nThe summer waned and each day, as it slipped away, took a little of Miss\nAinslie's strength with it. There was neither disease nor pain--it\nwas simply a letting go. Carl sent to the city for a physician of wide\nrepute, but he shook his head. \"There's nothing the matter with her,\" he\nsaid, \"but she doesn't want to live. Just keep her as happy as you can.\"\n\nFor a time she went about the house as usual, but, gradually, more\nand more of her duties fell to Ruth. Hepsey came in every day after\nbreakfast, and again in the late afternoon.\n\nRuth tried to get her to go out for a drive, but she refused. \"No,\ndeary,\" she said, smiling, \"I've never been away, and I'm too old to\nbegin now.\" Neighbours, hearing of her illness, came to offer sympathy\nand help, but she would see none of them--not even Aunt Jane.\n\nOne night, she sat at the head of the table as usual; for she would\nnot surrender her place as hostess, even though she ate nothing, and\nafterward a great weakness came upon her. \"I don't know how I'll ever\nget upstairs,\" she said, frightened; \"it seems such a long way!\"\n\nWinfield took her in his arms and carried her up, as gently and easily\nas if she had been a child. Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes bright\nwhen he put her down. \"I never thought it would be so easy,\" she said,\nin answer to his question. \"You'll stay with me, won't you, Carl? I\ndon't want you to go away.\"\n\n\"I'll stay as long as you want me, Miss Ainslie, and Ruth will, too. We\ncouldn't do too much for you.\"\n\nThat night, as they sat in front of the fire, while Miss Ainslie slept\nupstairs, Ruth told him what she had said about leaving him the house\nand the little income and giving her the beautiful things in the house.\n\n\"Bless her sweet heart,\" he said tenderly, \"we don't want her\nthings--we'd rather have her.\"\n\n\"Indeed we would,\" she answered quickly.\n\nUntil the middle of September she went back and forth from her own room\nto the sitting-room with comparative ease. They took turns bringing\ndainties to tempt her appetite, but, though she ate a little of\neverything and praised it warmly, especially if Ruth had made it, she\ndid it, evidently, only out of consideration for them.\n\nShe read a little, talked a little, and slept a great deal. One day she\nasked Carl to pull the heavy sandal wood chest over near her chair, and\ngive her the key, which hung behind a picture.\n\n\"Will you please go away now,\" she asked, with a winning smile, \"for\njust a little while?\"\n\nHe put the bell on a table within her reach and asked her to ring if she\nwanted anything. The hours went by and there was no sound. At last he\nwent up, very quietly, and found her asleep. The chest was locked and\nthe key was not to be found. He did not know whether she had opened it\nor not, but she let him put it in its place again, without a word.\n\nSometimes they read to her, and she listened patiently, occasionally\nasking a question, but more often falling asleep.\n\n\"I wish,\" she said one day, when she was alone with Carl, \"that I could\nhear something you had written.\"\n\n\"Why, Miss Ainslie,\" he exclaimed, in astonishment, \"you wouldn't be\ninterested in the things I write--it's only newspaper stuff.\"\n\n\"Yes, I would,\" she answered softly; \"yes, I would.\"\n\nSomething in the way she said it brought the mist to his eyes.\n\nShe liked to have Ruth brush her hair, but her greatest delight was in\nhearing Winfield talk about her treasures.\n\n\"Won't you tell me about the rug, Carl, the one on the sandal wood\nchest?\" she asked, for the twentieth time.\n\n\"It's hundreds of years old,\" he began, \"and it came from Persia, far,\nfar beyond the sea. The shepherds watched their flocks night and day,\nand saved the finest fleeces for the rug. They made colour from flowers\nand sweet herbs; from strange things that grew on the mountain heights,\nwhere only the bravest dared to go. The sumac that flamed on the hills,\nthe rind of the swaying pomegranates, lichens that grew on the rocks by\nthe Eastern sea, berries, deep-sea treasures, vine leaves, the juice of\nthe grape--they all made colours for the rug, and then ripened, like old\nwine.\n\n\"After a long time, when everything was ready, the Master Craftsman\nmade the design, writing strange symbols into the margin, eloquent with\nhidden meanings, that only the wisest may understand. \"They all worked\nupon it, men and women and children. Deep voices sang love songs and the\nmelody was woven into the rug. Soft eyes looked love in answer and the\nsoftness and beauty went in with the fibre. Baby fingers clutched at it\nand were laughingly untangled. At night, when the fires of the village\nwere lighted, and the crimson glow was reflected upon it, strange tales\nof love and war were mingled with the thread. \"The nightingale sang into\nit, the roses from Persian gardens breathed upon it, the moonlight put\nwitchery into it; the tinkle of the gold and silver on the women's dusky\nankles, the scent of sandal wood and attar of rose--it all went into the\nrug.\n\n\"Poets repeated their verses to it, men knelt near it to say their\nprayers, and the soft wind, rising from the sea, made faintest music\namong the threads.\n\n\"Sometimes a workman made a mistake, and the Master Craftsman put him\naside. Often, the patient fingers stopped weaving forever, and they\nfound some one else to go on with it. Sometimes they went from one place\nto another, but the frame holding the rug was not injured. From mountain\nto valley and back again, urged by some strange instinct, past flowing\nrivers and over the golden sands of the desert, even to the deep blue\nwaters that broke on the shore--they took the rug.\n\n\"The hoof-beats of Arabian horses, with white-robed Bedouins flashing\ntheir swords; all the glitter and splendour of war were woven into it.\nSongs of victory, the rush of a cavalry charge, the faith of a dying\nwarrior, even the slow marches of defeat--it all went into the rug.\n\n\"Perhaps the Master Craftsman died, but the design was left, and willing\nfingers toiled upon it, through the long years, each day putting new\nbeauty into it and new dreams. Then, one day, the final knot was tied,\nby a Veiled Lady, who sighed softly in the pauses of her song, and\nwondered at its surpassing loveliness.\" \"And--\" said Miss Ainslie,\ngently.\n\n\"Some one who loved you brought it to you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she repeated, smiling, \"some one who loved me. Tell me about\nthis,\" she pleaded, touching a vase of Cloisonne.\n\n\"It came from Japan,\" he said, \"a strange world of people like those\npainted on a fan. The streets are narrow and there are quaint houses on\neither side. The little ladies flit about in gay attire, like so many\nbutterflies--they wear queer shoes on their dainty feet. They're as\nsweet as their own cherry blossoms.\n\n\"The little man who made this vase, wore a blue tunic and had no robes\nof state, because he was poor. He loved the daughter of a nobleman and\nshe loved him, too, though neither dared to say so. So he sat in front\nof his house and worked on this vase. He made a model of clay, shaping\nit with his fingers until it was perfect. Then a silver vase was cast\nfrom it and over and over it he went, very carefully, making a design\nwith flat, silver wire. When he was satisfied with it, he filled it\nin with enamel in wonderful colours, making even the spots on the\nbutterflies' wings like those he had seen in the fields. Outside the\ndesign, he covered the vase with dark enamel, so the bright colours\nwould show.\n\n\"As he worked, the little lady he loved came and watched him sometimes\nfor a moment or two, and then he put a tiny bit of gold into the vase.\nHe put a flower into the design, like those she wore in her hair, and\nthen another, like the one she dropped at his feet one day, when no one\nwas looking.\n\n\"The artist put all his love into the vase, and he hoped that when it\nwas done, he could obtain a Court position. He was very patient with the\ncountless polishings, and one afternoon, when the air was sweet with the\nodour of the cherry blossoms, the last touches were put upon it.\n\n\"It was so beautiful that he was commissioned to make some great vases\nfor the throne room, and then, with joy in his heart, he sought the hand\nof the nobleman's daughter.\n\n\"The negotiations were conducted by another person, and she was forced\nto consent, though her heart ached for the artist in the blue tunic,\nwhose name she did not know. When she learned that her husband was to be\nthe man she had loved for so long, tears of happiness came into her dark\neyes.\n\n\"The vase had disappeared, mysteriously, and he offered a large reward\nfor its recovery. At last they were compelled to give up the hope of\nfinding it, and he promised to make her another one, just like it, with\nthe same flowers and butterflies and even the little glints of gold that\nmarked the days she came. So she watched him, while he made the new one,\nand even more love went into it than into the first one.\"\n\n\"And--\" began Miss Ainslie.\n\n\"Some one who loved you brought it to you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she repeated, smiling, \"some one who loved me.\"\n\nWinfield fitted a story to every object in the room. Each rug had a\ndifferent history and every bit of tapestry its own tale. He conjured up\nan Empress who had once owned the teakwood chair, and a Marquise, with\npatches and powdered hair, who wrote love letters at the marquetry\ntable.\n\nHe told stories of the sea shells, and of the mermaids who brought them\nto the shore, that some one who loved her might take them to her, and\nthat the soft sound of the sea might always come to her ears, with\nvisions of blue skies and tropic islands, where the sun forever shone.\n\nThe Empress and the Marquise became real people to Miss Ainslie, and the\nJapanese lovers seemed to smile at her from the vase. Sometimes, holding\nthe rug on her lap, she would tell them how it was woven, and repeat the\nlove story of a beautiful woman who had worked upon the tapestry. Often,\nin the twilight, she would sing softly to herself, snatches of forgotten\nmelodies, and, once, a lullaby. Ruth and Carl sat by, watching for the\nslightest change, but she never spoke of the secret in her heart.\n\nRuth had the north room, across the hall, where there were two dressers.\nOne of them had been empty, until she put her things into it, and the\nother was locked. She found the key, one day, hanging behind it, when\nshe needed some things for Miss Ainslie.\n\nAs she had half expected, the dresser was full of lingerie, of the\nfinest lawn and linen. The dainty garments were edged with real\nlace--Brussels, Valenciennes, Mechlin, Point d'Alencon, and the fine\nIrish laces. Sometimes there was a cluster of tucks, daintily run by\nhand, but, usually, only the lace, unless there was a bit of insertion\nto match. The buttons were mother of pearl, and the button holes were\nexquisitely made. One or two of the garments were threaded with\nwhite ribbon, after a more modern fashion, but most of them were made\naccording to the quaint old patterns. There was a dozen of everything.\n\nThe dried lavender flowers rustled faintly as Ruth reverently lifted the\ngarments, giving out the long-stored sweetness of Summers gone by. The\nwhite had changed to an ivory tint, growing deeper every day. There\nwere eleven night gowns, all made exactly alike, with high neck and long\nsleeves, trimmed with tucks and lace. Only one was in any way elaborate.\nThe sleeves were short, evidently just above the elbow, and the neck was\ncut off the shoulders like a ball gown. A deep frill of Venetian point,\nwith narrower lace at the sleeves, of the same pattern, was the only\ntrimming, except a tiny bow of lavender ribbon at the fastening, pinned\non with a little gold heart.\n\nWhen Ruth went in, with one of the night gowns over her arm, a faint\ncolour came into Miss Ainslie's cheeks.\n\n\"Did--did--you find those?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Ruth, \"I thought you'd like to wear them.\"\n\nMiss Ainslie's colour faded and it was some time before she spoke again.\n\n\"Did--did you find the other--the one with Venetian point?\" \"Yes, Miss\nAinslie, do you want that one It's beautiful.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"not now, but I thought that I'd like to wear\nthat--afterward, you know.\"\n\nA shadow crossed Ruth's face and her lips tightened.\n\n\"Don't, dear,\" said Miss Ainslie, gently.\n\n\"Do you think he would think it was indelicate if--if my neck were bare\nthen?\"\n\n\"Who, Miss Ainslie?\"\n\n\"Carl. Would he think it was wrong if I wore that afterward, and my neck\nand shoulders showed? Do you think he would?\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Ruth, \"I know he wouldn't! Oh, Miss Ainslie, you break my\nheart!\"\n\n\"Ruth,\" said Miss Ainslie, gently; \"Ruth, dear, don't cry! I won't talk\nabout it any more, deary, I promise you, but I wanted to know so much!\"\n\nRuth kissed her and went away, unable to bear more just then. She\nbrought her chair into the hall, to be near her if she were needed. Miss\nAinslie sighed, and then began to croon a lullaby.\n\n\n\n\nXVII. Dawn\n\nAs Miss Ainslie became weaker, she clung to Carl, and was never\nsatisfied when he was out of her sight. When she was settled in bed for\nthe night, he went in to sit by her and hold her hand until she dropped\nasleep. If she woke during the night she would call Ruth and ask where\nhe was.\n\n\"He'll come over in the morning, Miss Ainslie,\" Ruth always said; \"you\nknow it's night now.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" she would ask, drowsily. \"I must go to sleep, then, deary, so\nthat I may be quite rested and refreshed when he comes.\"\n\nHer room, in contrast to the rest of the house, was almost Puritan in\nits simplicity. The bed and dresser were mahogany, plain, but highly\npolished, and she had a mahogany rocker with a cushion of old blue\ntapestry. There was a simple white cover on the bed and another on\nthe dresser, but the walls were dead white, unrelieved by pictures or\ndraperies. In the east window was a long, narrow footstool, and a prayer\nbook and hymnal lay on the window sill, where this maiden of half a\ncentury, looking seaward, knelt to say her prayers.\n\nOne morning, when Ruth went in, she said: \"I think I won't get up this\nmorning, dear; I am so very tired. If Carl should come over, will you\nsay that I should like to see him?\"\n\nShe would see no one but Carl and Ruth, and Mrs. Ball was much offended\nbecause her friend did not want her to come upstairs. \"Don't be harsh\nwith her, Aunt Jane,\" pleaded Ruth, \"you know people often have strange\nfancies when they are ill. She sent her love to you, and asked me to say\nthat she thanked you, but you need not put the light in the attic window\nany more.\"\n\nMrs. Ball gazed at her niece long and earnestly. \"Be you tellin' me the\ntruth?\" she asked.\n\n\"Why, of course, Aunty.\"\n\n\"Then Mary Ainslie has got sense from somewheres. There ain't never\nbeen no need for that lamp to set in the winder; and when she gets more\nsense, I reckon she'll be willin' to see her friends.\" With evident\nrelief upon her face, Mrs. Ball departed.\n\nBut Miss Ainslie seemed quite satisfied, and each day spoke more\nlovingly to Ruth and Carl. He showed no signs of impatience, but spent\nhis days with her cheerfully. He read to her, held her hand, and told\nher about the rug, the Marquise, and the Japanese lovers. At the end she\nwould always say, with a quiet tenderness: \"and some one who loved me\nbrought it to me!\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Ainslie; some one who loved you. Everybody loves you; don't\nyou know that?\"\n\n\"Do you?\" she asked once, suddenly and yet shyly.\n\n\"Indeed I do, Miss Ainslie--I love you with all my heart.\"\n\nShe smiled happily and her eyes filled. \"Ruth,\" she called softly, \"he\nsays he loves me!\"\n\n\"Of course he does,\" said Ruth; \"nobody in the wide world could help\nloving you.\"\n\nShe put out her left hand to touch Ruth, and the amethyst ring slipped\noff, for her fingers were thin. She did not seem to notice when Ruth\nslipped it on again, and, shortly afterward, fell asleep.\n\nThat night Winfield stayed very late. \"I don't want to leave you, dear,\"\nhe said to Ruth. \"I'm afraid something is going to happen.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid--I think you'd better go.\"\n\n\"Will you put a light in your window if you want me, darling?\" \"Yes, I\nwill.\"\n\n\"I can see it from my room, and I'll be watching for it. If you want me,\nI'll come.\"\n\nHe awoke from an uneasy sleep with the feeling that Ruth needed him, and\nwas not surprised to see the light from her candle streaming out into\nthe darkness. He dressed hurriedly, glancing at his watch by the light\nof a match. It was just three o'clock.\n\nRuth was waiting for him at the lower door. \"Is she--is she--\"\n\n\"No, she seems to be just the same, but she wants you. She's been\ncalling for you ever since you went away.\"\n\nAs they went upstairs Miss Ainslie's sweet voice came to them in pitiful\npleading: \"Carl, Carl, dear! Where are you? I want you!\"\n\n\"I'm here, Miss Ainslie,\" he said, sitting down on the bed beside her\nand taking her hot hands in his. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"Tell me about the rug.\"\n\nWith no hint of weariness in his deep, quiet voice, he told her the old\nstory once more. When he had finished, she spoke again. \"I can't seem to\nget it just right about the Japanese lovers. Were they married?\"\n\n\"Yes, they were married and lived happily ever afterward--like the\npeople in the fairy tales.\"\n\n\"That was lovely,\" she said, with evident satisfaction. \"Do you think\nthey wanted me to have their vase?\"\n\n\"I know they did. Some one who loved you brought it to you. Everybody\nloves you, Miss Ainslie.\"\n\n\"Did the Marquise find her lover?\"\n\n\"Yes, or rather, he found her.\"\n\n\"Did they want me to have their marquetry table?\"\n\n\"Of course they did. Didn't some one who loved you bring it to you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she sighed, \"some one who loved me.\"\n\nShe sang a little, very softly, with her eyes closed. It was a quaint\nold-fashioned tune, with a refrain of \"Hush-a-by\" and he held her hand\nuntil the song ceased and she was asleep. Then he went over to Ruth.\n\"Can't you go to sleep for a little while, dearest? I know you're\ntired.\"\n\n\"I'm never tired when I'm with you,\" Ruth answered, leaning upon his\narm, \"and besides, I feel that this is the end.\"\n\nMiss Ainslie slept for some time, then, all at once, she started as if\nin terror. \"Letters,\" she said, very distinctly, \"Go!\"\n\nHe went to her and tried to soothe her, but failed. \"No,\" she said\nagain, \"letters--Ruth--chest.\"\n\n\"She wants some letters that are in the sandal wood chest,\" he said to\nRuth, and Miss Ainslie nodded. \"Yes,\" she repeated, \"letters.\"\n\nRuth went into the sitting-room, where a light was burning dimly, but\nthe chest was locked. \"Do you know where the key is, Carl?\" she asked,\ncoming back for a moment.\n\n\"No, I don't, dear,\" he answered. Then he asked Miss Ainslie where the\nkey was, but she only murmured: \"letters.\"\n\n\"Shall I go and help Ruth find them?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"help--letters.\"\n\nTogether, they broke open the lock of the chest, while Miss Ainslie was\ncalling, faintly: \"Carl, Carl, dear! Where are you? I want you!\"\n\n\"We'd better turn the whole thing out on the floor,\" he said, suiting\nthe action to the word, then put it back against the wall, empty. \"We'll\nhave to shake everything out, carefully,\" returned Ruth, \"that's the\nonly way to find them.\"\n\nWrapped carefully in a fine linen sheet, was Miss Ainslie's wedding\ngown, of heavy white satin, trimmed simply with priceless Venetian\npoint. They shook it out hurriedly and put it back into the chest. There\nwere yards upon yards of lavender taffeta, cut into dress lengths,\nwhich they folded up and put away. Three strings of amethysts and two of\npearls slipped out of the silk as they lifted it, and there was another\nlength of lustrous white taffeta, which had changed to an ivory tint.\n\nFour shawls of Canton crepe, three of them lavender and one ivory\nwhite, were put back into the chest. There were several fans, of fine\nworkmanship, a girdle of oxidized silver, set with amethysts and pearls,\nand a large marquetry box, which contained tea. \"That's all the large\nthings,\" he said; \"now we can look these over.\"\n\nRuth was gathering up great quantities of lace--Brussels, Point\nd'Alencon, Cluny, Mechlin, Valenciennes, Duchesse and Venetian point.\nThere was a bridal veil of the Venetian lace, evidently made to match\nthat on the gown. Tiny, dried petals rustled out of the meshes, for Miss\nAinslie's laces were laid away in lavender, like her love.\n\n\"I don't see them,\" she said, \"yes, here they are.\" She gave him a\nbundle of yellowed letters, tied with lavender ribbon. \"I'll take them\nto her,\" he answered, picking up a small black case that lay on the\nfloor, and opening it. \"Why, Ruth!\" he gasped. \"It's my father's\npicture!\"\n\nMiss Ainslie's voice rose again in pitiful cadence. \"Carl, Carl, dear!\nWhere are you? I want you--oh, I want you!\"\n\nHe hastened to her, leaving the picture in Ruth's hand. It was an\nambrotype, set into a case lined with purple velvet. The face was\nthat of a young man, not more than twenty-five or thirty, who looked\nstrangely like Winfield. The eyes, forehead and the poise of the head\nwere the same.\n\nThe earth trembled beneath Ruth's feet for a moment, then, all at once,\nshe understood. The light in the attic window, the marked paragraph in\nthe paper, and the death notices--why, yes, the Charles Winfield who\nhad married Abigail Weatherby was Miss Ainslie's lover, and Carl was his\nson. \"He went away!\" Miss Ainslie's voice came again to Ruth, when she\ntold her story, with no hint of her lover's name. He went away, and\nsoon afterward, married Abigail Weatherby, but why? Was it love at first\nsight, or did he believe that his sweetheart was dead? Then Carl\nwas born and the mother died. Twelve years afterward, he followed\nher--broken hearted. Carl had told her that his father could not bear\nthe smell of lavender nor the sight of any shade of purple--and Miss\nAinslie always wore lavender and lived in the scent of it--had he come\nto shrink from it through remorse?\n\nWhy was it, she wondered? Had he forgotten Miss Ainslie, or had he\nbeen suddenly swept off his feet by some blind whirlwind of passion? In\neither case, memory had returned to torture him a thousand fold--to make\nhim ashamed to face her, with his boy in his arms.\n\nAnd Aunt Jane knew of the marriage, at the time, probably, and said\nno word. Then she learned of Abigail Weatherby's death, and was still\nsilent, hoping, perhaps, that the wanderer would come back, until she\nlearned that Charles Winfield, too, was dead. And still she had not told\nMiss Ainslie, or, possibly, thought she knew it all till the day that\nHepsey had spoken of; when she came home, looking \"strange,\" to keep the\nlight in the attic window every night for more than five years.\n\nWas it kind? Ruth doubted for a moment, then her heart softened with\nlove for Aunt Jane, who had hidden the knowledge that would be a death\nblow to Miss Ainslie, and let her live on, happy in her dream, while the\nstern Puritan conscience made her keep the light in the attic window in\nfulfilment of her promise.\n\nAs if the little light could reach the veil which hangs between us\nand Eternity, or penetrate the greyness which never parts save for a\npassage! As if all Miss Ainslie's love and faith could bring the dead to\nlife again, even to be forgiven!\n\nHer lips quivered when she thought of Miss Ainslie's tenderness for Carl\nand the little whispered lullabies that she sang to herself, over and\nover again. \"She does not know,\" thought Ruth. \"Thank God, she will\nnever know!\"\n\nShe put the rest of the things into the chest and closed it, covering\nit, as before, with the rug Miss Ainslie loved. When she went into\nthe other room, she was asleep again, with her cheek pillowed on the\nletters, while Carl sat beside her, holding her hand and pondering over\nthe mystery he could not explain. Ruth's heart ached for those two, so\nstrangely brought together, who had but this little hour to atone for a\nlifetime of loss.\n\nThe first faint lines of light came into the eastern sky. Ruth stood by\nthe window, watching the colour come on the grey above the hill, while\ntwo or three stars still shone dimly. The night lamp flickered, then\nwent out. She set it in the hall and came back to the window.\n\nAs Miss Ainslie's rug had been woven, little by little, purple, crimson,\nand turquoise, gleaming with inward fires, shone upon the clouds.\nCarl came over to Ruth, putting his arm around her. They watched it\ntogether--that miracle which is as old as the world, and yet ever new.\n\"I don't see--\" he began.\n\n\"Hush, dear,\" Ruth whispered, \"I know, and I'll tell you some time, but\nI don't want her to know.\"\n\nThe sky brightened slowly, and the intense colour came into the room\nwith the light. Ruth drew the curtains aside, saying, in a low tone,\n\"it's beautiful, isn't it?\"\n\nThere was a sudden movement in the room and they turned, to see Miss\nAinslie sitting up, her cheeks flushed, and the letters scattered around\nher. The ribbon had slipped away, and her heavy white hair fell over her\nshoulders. Ruth went to her, to tie it back again, but she put her away,\nvery gently, without speaking.\n\nCarl stood by the window, thinking, and Miss Ainslie's eyes rested upon\nhim, with wonder and love. The sunrise stained her white face and her\neyes shone brightly, as sapphires touched with dawn. The first ray of\nthe sun came into the little room and lay upon her hair, changing its\nwhiteness to gleaming silver. Then all at once her face illumined, as\nfrom a light within.\n\nCarl moved away from the window, strangely drawn toward her, and her\nface became radiant with unspeakable joy. Then the passion of her denied\nmotherhood swelled into a cry of longing--\"My son!\"\n\n\"Mother!\" broke from his lips in answer He went to her blindly, knowing\nonly that they belonged to each other, and that, in some inscrutable\nway, they had been kept apart until it was too late. He took her into\nhis arms, holding her close, and whispering, brokenly, what only she and\nGod might hear! Ruth turned away, sobbing, as if it was something too\nholy for her to see.\n\nMiss Ainslie, transfigured with unearthly light, lifted her face to his.\nHer lips quivered for an instant, then grew cold beneath his own. She\nsank back among the pillows, with her eyes closed, but with yet another\nglory upon the marble whiteness of her face, as though at the end of her\njourney, and beyond the mists that divided them, her dream had become\ndivinely true.\n\nThen he, who should have been her son, bent down, the tears falling\nunheeded upon her face, and kissed her again.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Lavender and Old Lace, by Myrtle Reed\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LAVENDER AND OLD LACE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1266.txt or 1266.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/2\/6\/1266\/\n\nProduced by Dianne Bean\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":783,"split":"train"}
