Three frontiersmen are traveling west to find a new home. The oldest is Chingachgook, the last chief of the Mohican tribe. With him are his son, Uncas, and an adopted son, a white man named Nathaniel Poe, who also goes by the name \u201cNathaniel Hawkeye\u201d.\nMeanwhile, British Army Major Duncan Heyward has arrived in Albany. He has been sent to serve under Colonel Edmund Munro, the commander of Fort William Henry, along Lake George, an important point in the defense of New York against the French in Canada. Heyward has also been given the assignment of escorting the colonel\u2019s two daughters, Cora and Alice, to the fort to join their father. He is a family friend, and in love with Cora, and proposes to her before they leave. She does not give him an answer.\nMajor Heyward, the two women, and a troop of British soldiers march through the rugged countryside to reach the fort. They are led by a single guide, Magua, a warrior of the Huron tribe. Suddenly, Magua leads the party into an ambush, where many of the soldiers are killed, but Heyward and the women survive. The fight is interrupted by the arrival of Chingachgook and his sons, who kill the enemy warriors while Magua escapes. The major and the women are now stranded and the Mohicans and Hawkeye agree to accompany them the rest of the way. Hawkeye observes that Magua attempted to kill Cora, and asks Duncan about any ties to the Huron. During this trek, Cora begins to form a bond with Hawkeye, and Heyward notices.\nWhen they arrive near the fort, they find it under siege by the French. They enter the fort during the bombardment, and are greeted by Colonel Munro, who asks Major Heyward about the reinforcements. The Colonel admits to Heyward and the others that the fort is about to fall. While there, Cora and Hawkeye share a passionate kiss. Heyward begins to suspect Cora\u2019s attraction to Hawkeye, and erupts in jealousy. In response, Cora finally tells him she will not marry him.\nThe fort falls, but the French general, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, paroles the remaining British troops and allows them to return to Albany safely. It is revealed that Magua and his Huron army are allies of the French. In a secret meeting, Magua reveals his hatred for Colonel Munro, and his desire for revenge for the murder of his family.\nThe following day, Colonel Munro and everyone else march with the British garrison from the fort. In the countryside, Magua and his Huron warriors ambush the British, and Magua kills Colonel Munro. Hawkeye and the Mohicans fight their way through, leading Cora, Alice, and Heyward from the battle, though Magua later captures the Major and the women, and takes them prisoner.\nAt a Huron village, Magua presents the women and the officer to a sachem, a chief, in hopes of gaining recognition as a war leader. His appeals are interrupted by Hawkeye, who has come to plead for the lives of the prisoners. The sachem rules that while Heyward is to return to the British and Alice is to be given to Magua, Cora is to be burned alive. Hawkeye asks Heyward, who is serving as translator between Hawkeye and the sachem, to take his life in Cora's place. In a final gesture of affection and redemption, Heyward arranges to be executed in Cora\u2019s place. Once Cora and Hawkeye escape, Hawkeye shoots Heyward in the head just as he is about to be engulfed by the flames. Later, along steep mountain trails, Chingachgook, Uncas, and Hawkeye track and ambush Magua\u2019s war party to free Alice. Uncas is killed by Magua and thrown down the mountain. Alice chooses to calmly step off the cliff to her death rather than go to the beckoning Magua. In single combat with Chingachgook, Magua is defeated and killed.\nIn the end, during a funeral ritual with Hawkeye and Cora, Chingachgook prays to the Great Spirit in honor of Uncas, calling himself \"the last of the Mohicans\".\n<html>\n\n<head>\n   <title>The Last Of The Mohicans by  Michael Mann and Christopher Crowe<\/title>\n<\/head>\n\n<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">\n   <pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS\n\n                                      Screenplay by\n\n                            Michael Mann and Christopher Crowe\n\n                      Adaption by John L.

Off to the side are an English Lieutenant \n               on horseback and a ten-man escort from whatever regiment's \n               in Albany. A man named HENRI speaks in French.

He says something to \n               Chingachgook who nods. Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart \n               in an outer grouping of the men.

They're in \n               shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings. The Mohawks' \n               vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They \n               've been acculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear \n               European calico hunting shirts.\n\n               Their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are \n               tattooed. They've politically and commercially played France \n               & England against each other very adroitly for over a hundred \n               years because of their military power and geographic position. \n               Their relations with working farmers and settlers and their \n               families has been mostly one of co-existence because there's \n               always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA mural of \n               ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America.

But this Huron easily slips the thrust \n               and slams Heyward with his rifle butt.\n\n               BRITISH\n\n               dead and dying.\n\n               AMBROSE\n\n               blood gushing from his chest wound, fires his pistol, dropping \n               a Huron; slashes a second with his sword. Then he's chopped \n               down. Hurons begin scalping the British while four race \n               towards Heyward and the two women.\n\n               HEYWARD & CORA & ALICE\n\n               ready to die. Heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon. He \n               readies...\n\n               THREE LOUD SHOTS\n\n               BLOW three of the Hurons sideways, head over heels down the \n               rise.\n\n               REVERSE: THREE MEN\n\n               barely seen, running diagonally across the fall line of the \n               ravine. In parts, we recognize Nathaniel, recharging Killdeer \n               on full run, and Uncas.\n\n               HURON'S\n\n               not sure where the shots came from. Suddenly Chingachgook \n               slams him, head first into the ravine with the war club. He \n               didn't even slow down.\n\n               HURON\n\n               warrior spins. Uncas tomahawks his shoulder. The Huron swings \n               downwards. Uncas ducks beneath the swing and slashes his \n               throat, sending him downhill into CAMERA as...\n\n               HAWKEYE'S\n\n               momentum and thrown tomahawk spread-eagles one Huron, near a \n               couple of wounded Redcoats who fight on...\n\n               MAGUA\n\n               calmly sees the odds have changed. His attention becomes \n               focused. He commits a very revealing act seen through the \n               blurred foreground action of struggling bodies. We will \n               remember it. He raises his musket and aims at...\n\n               CORA MUNRO\n\n               who's unaware she's a target. Why is he singling out a Munro \n               girl to kill?\n\n               HAWKEYE\n\n               sees. Killdeer's at his shoulder...\n\n               TIME SLOWS: MAGUA\n\n               senses Hawkeye. Moving through liquid, his eyes drift left. \n               The moment is frozen.\n\n               Their eyes lock, each to the other's.  Then...\n\n               TIME UNFREEZES\n\n               Magua swings at Hawkeye and FIRES...\n\n               HAWKEYE\n\n               shifts. The .65 caliber musket ball rockets past his ear and \n               he's already squeezing Killdeer's trigger as...\n\n               HAWKEYE'S POV OVER BARREL: SMOKE\n\n               from Magua's musket blast clears. Magua's gone. He almost \n               shape-shifted, it happened so quickly. It's nearly mystical.\n\n               HAWKEYE\n\n               lowers Killdeer, impressed.\n\n               CORA\n\n               glances back at Hawkeye. She doesn't know why he's looking \n               at her.\n\n               CHINGACHGOOK\n\n               pursues two fleeing Hurons up the incline. Two strides gain \n               him the first man, who he hamstrings and runs over to pursue \n               the second up the hill... as...\n\n               HEYWARD\n\n               in the confused melee, grabs a found musket and aims it at \n               an Indian. We recognize that he's aiming at Chingachgook \n               pursuing the second Huron up the hill...\n\n                                     CORA\n                         No, Duncan!\n\n               Duncan ignores her.\n\n               HEYWARD'S MUSKET\n\n               is jerked from his hands.\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         ...case your aim is any better'n \n                         your judgment.\n\n               He's drawn his sword, reflexively. Hawkeye flips the musket \n               around one-handed. It's pointed at Heyward's chest. And \n               Hawkeye FIRES, killing an attacking Huron behind Heyward. As \n               Heyward spins...\n\n               CHINGACHGOOK'S WAR CLUB\n\n               flashes up the hill. It cleaves the second man's back and \n               bowls him over. Chingachgook retrieves his club as his \n               scalping knife slashes down...\n\n               UNCAS\n\n               scalps the man he killed. Chingachgook dispatches the Huron \n               he hamstrung.\n\n               WIDE\n\n               Sudden silence. Heyward's motionless. The women are frozen, \n               as terrified of the savages and apparent half-breed rescuers \n               as they were of those who attacked them.\n\n               ALICE\n\n               Cora, holding her, is stunned but functioning. Moments ago \n               both women were clean and demure. Now their riding dresses \n               are torn, mud-stained, blood-spattered and their baggage is \n               gone.\n\n               HEYWARD'S\n\n               crossed to his slaughtered soldiers. Moments ago they were a \n               testament to British military power. Now they're dead meat. \n               Ambrose's body is against a tree. In the B.G.  two of the \n               wounded start to rise...\n\n                                     ALICE (O.S.)\n                         Stop it!\n\n               Heyward spins.\n\n               UNCAS\n\n               just cut the throat of the second Narraganset. It drops into \n               the brush. Alice attacks him.\n\n                                     ALICE\n                         We need them to get out of here!\n\n               Uncas gently restrains her. Cora reaches Alice and grabs her \n               away from the \"savage\".\n\n               Heyward runs in to protect the women...\n\n                                     HEYWARD\n                              (to Nathaniel)\n                         ...why the bloody hell he do that to \n                         the horses?!\n\n               Uncas, all business, is now reloading, lifting powder horns, \n               scanning the trees.\n\n                                     UNCAS\n                              (matter of fact)\n                         ...too easy to track...they can be \n                         heard for miles... find yourself a \n                         musket...\n\n               Cora's surprised by Uncas' easy English. Hawkeye's scanning \n               the forest.\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                              (to Heyward)\n                         Your wounded should try walkin' back \n                         to Albany.

Cora's surprised to see \n               it's Chingachgook's decision. Chingachgook looks at the \n               survivors, gives his assent, starts off.\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         ...take you as far as the fort.\n\n               Hawkeye throws Heyward a musket. Cora & Alice look towards \n               Heyward. He looks at them: the women are totally terrified \n               and do not move.\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         If we are goin' to take you, we need \n                         to move.  Fast... And the fort is \n                         well off our course.  So if you all \n                         rather wait for the next Huron war \n                         party to come by, we'll be on our \n                         way.\n\n               Heyward quickly decides to go. The women follow. Hawkeye \n               starts off after Uncas and Chingachgook.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. FOREST - DAY\n\n               HAWKEYE\n\n               Moves through the trackless forest. Uncas is far out on the \n               left flank. Cora, Alice & Duncan Heyward follow in Hawkeye's \n               and Chingachgook's steps...\n\n               HAWKEYE'S FEET\n\n               walking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead \n               of on stones.  The others follow. Hawkeye looks at Heyward.\n\n               HEYWARD\n\n               conforms.

Wary, silently, they hunt.\n\n               DEEPER: MORE OTTAWA\n\n               Towards the rear are two French Rangers (\"Coureurs des Bois\") \n               from Le Regiment de la Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed \n               Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and breechcloths with \n               hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. \n               They're the 18th century version of Special Forces who've \n               gone indigenous.

Her \n               hyperventilating and involuntary small sounds of fear will \n               reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and silences \n               her struggling. WIDEN.

Montcalm's four personal guards are \n               at the entrance as well as COMTE DE LEVIS in dirty lace, a \n               facial wound and a braceful of pistols on a sash. Inside is \n               simple campaign furniture and a six by eight foot battle \n               standard and flag of France.\n\n               MONTCALM\n\n               stands with a huge and fearsome elaborately tattooed and \n               robed Seneca chief in a silk turban...\n\n                                     SENECA CHIEF\n                              (low)\n                         ... and the Black Robes of \n                         Michilimackinac left us no time to \n                         put our cabins in order before telling \n                         us our French father had need of our \n                         aid. We rolled our blankets and were \n                         the first to be here. Yet we are not \n                         the first and closest to my father's \n                         campfire.\n\n               The Marquis de Montcalm is forty-five, wears a large wampum \n               belt as a sash over his waistcoat. He has an acute intellect, \n               an elegant manner. He is more aristocratic than Munro, but a \n               consummate professional soldier. Over the Seneca's shoulder, \n               Montcalm sees and nods to...\n\n               MAGUA\n\n               entering with four Huron braves. This is not the Magua we \n               saw on the trail. In his scalp lock, now red-stained and cut \n               to a Huron roach, are three blacl plumes. A match-coat blanket \n               drapes his left shoulder.\n\n                                     MONTCALM\n                              (to Seneca Chief)\n                         For my children and the children of \n                         the true faith, my friendship and \n                         esteem is boundless...  I will give \n                         you three oxen for a feast and \n                         tomorrow I, myself, will sing the \n                         war song with you in the great council \n                         house.\n\n               The Seneca Chief is satisfied and his people, plus the Jesuit, \n               exit. The look on Magua's face and the wry expression on \n               Montcalm's allows us to understand their relationship is \n               based on realpolitik.\n\n                                     MONTCALM\n                         Le Renard Subtil, how are things \n                         with your English friends?\n\n               Magua exhales in derision as he brings a chair to face \n               Montcalm and sits, European style...\n\n                                     MONTCALM\n                              (over his shoulder)\n                         Louis Antoine, join us.\n\n               LOUIS ANTOINE DE BOUGAINVILLE enters. He wears a functional \n               melange of Indian moccasins over white linen breeches and an \n               officer's waistcoat.\n\n                                     MONTCALM\n                         Hear what le Subtil has to tell us...\n\n               Bougainville published a book on integral calculus at twenty-\n               five, at twenty-six was a secretary to the French Ambassador \n               in London, in January 1756 at twenty-seven he was elected a \n               member of the British Royal Academy of Science and at age \n               twenty-eight he's aide de camp to the Marquis de Montcalm \n               with the rank of captain. Later in life, he brought \n               \"bougainvillea\" from Tahiti to Europe to America.\n\n                                     MAGUA\n                         English war chief, Webb goes to Fort \n                         Edward with 33rd Regiment.

She looks \n               different. He's a little indignant.\n\n                                     PHELPS\n                         First assisted me in Austria when \n                         she was fourteen. I would say she \n                         does...\n\n               Her apron is stained. Hawkeye sees this may be her first \n               time in the New World, but it's not her first military \n               campaign. Still angered at Munro's dismissive response, he's \n               nevertheless falling for Cora.\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         She does not shy away from much...\n\n                                     PHELPS\n                              (elsewhere)\n                         What's that?\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         Nothin'.\n\n               Alice Munro has caught Hawkeye's attention. Outside the \n               surgery where a casement meets a wall, she sits, withdrawn. \n               A catatonic older woman in a fine dress sits next to her.\n\n                                     PHELPS (O.S.)\n                         Miss Cora?

Hawkeye cuts some pieces from her ruined \n               and discarded dress that she now uses to bandage Uncas. We \n               don't know why; neither does Cora.\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                              (to Uncas)\n                         You 'bout done holdin' hands with \n                         Miss Munro?\n\n               Uncas laughs, looking from her to Hawkeye. Then he's up and \n               he hurts. Cora starts to tend another wounded man. As they \n               start out, Hawkeye hesitates. Sensing it, Cora turns.\n\n                                     CORA\n                         What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         Why, I am looking at you, Miss.\n\n               Cora measures the directness of Hawkeye's manner.

Alice, living through a wide-awake \n               nightmare, is huddled under the arm of her sister. They ride \n               behind the standard bearers. In the B.G. her father is seen \n               approaching and takes his position at their side. Cora looks \n               down the column, sheilding her eyes against the sun.

On \n               his downswing...\n\n               HAWKEYE\n\n               running through surreal patches, thinks he glimpses Cora two \n               hundred yards away.\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         Cora!\n\n               Chingachgook, on Hawkeye's left, slams down two Hurons with \n               his war club.\n\n               CORA & ALICE\n\n               running through the chaos and murder and British troopers \n               and Mohawks locked in struggle with Hurons. Cora's dress is \n               torn. She holds Alice to her. There's a pistol in Cora's \n               hand.\n\n               ONE HURON\n\n               scalping a prone soldier, rips the trophy from his head, \n               turns and faces us.\n\n                                     CORA\n                         shoots him in the face.\n\n               EXTREMELY CLOSE: ALICE\n\n               and her eyes take it all in. And her affect starts to flatten. \n               A blankness suffuses her expression and the girl withdraws \n               from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her head.\n\n               HAWKEYE\n\n               locked in combat. He tomahawks one Huron's arm with a slashing \n               downstroke and comes right back into the face of the second \n               with his backswing while his right hand fires Killdeer at...\n\n               HURON\n\n               six feet from Uncas and about to shoot him in the back.\n\n               HAWKEYE\n\n               free for a moment, spins. He has no idea of direction any \n               more. Everything is death in strange tableaux. Meanwhile:\n\n               MUNRO\n\n               hollering\n\n                                     MUNRO\n                         Cora! Alice!\n\n               He cuts down a Huron with his sword who is trying to leap at \n               him from the right. An Osage warrior with red scalp-lock \n               leaps on the back of Munro's horse, reaching over to stab \n               down into Munro's neck. The old man's left hand grabs the \n               warrior's knife hand in an iron grip. His right hand pulls \n               his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires backward, \n               point blank, blowing the Osage off the back of his horse.\n\n               WIDER\n\n               Just then Munro's mount is shot. His horse rears up, throws \n               Munro and falls on him.\n\n               HEYWARD\n\n               shouting orders over the deafening noise.\n\n                                     HEYWARD\n                         Second rank fire!

They're getting cut off. They close ranks \n               automatically as a man drops. They're retreating in perfect \n               order.\n\n               HURON WARRIOR\n\n               about to strike a downwards blow is pushed aside by Magua.\n\n               CLOSER: MAGUA\n\n               his eyes drop to what's in front of him. The field goes quiet.\n\n               OVER MAGUA'S SHOULDER:\n\n               MUNRO\n\n               his lower body is trapped under his dead horse.

The Huron goes down and then the Mohawk is shot. The \n               Huron who shot him is cut down by a Ranger with tomahawk in \n               one hand and bayonet in the other. Two Mohawks and three \n               Rangers fighting back to back. They become an island swamped \n               by Huron and Ottawa: amidst bodies and ground slippery with \n               blood. As smoke obscures their image.\n\n               CORA & ALICE\n\n               in a group of civilian militia. Two of the militiamen are \n               shot down. The third engages a Fox warrior.

But his arm and shoulder \n               and half his chest are splashed red with blood.\n\n               LONG SHOT: MAGUA\n\n               seen from far away, holding aloft the heart of Munro.\n\n               REVERSE: HAWKEYE\n\n               saw him and fights his way to attack when...\n\n               WHITE HORSE\n\n               crazed, CRASHES through men, knocking Hawkeye over...\n\n               CHINGACHGOOK\n\n               protecting Hawkeye, slams his war club into one Huron, \n               breaking his attack, his arm and his skull and swings the \n               other way burying the bladed end into the chest of an Ottawa \n               who's behind him. Then...\n\n               HAWKEYE'S\n\n               up, looking wildly...\n\n               CAMERA JAMS INTO CLEARING SMOKE:\n\n               33rd Regiment of Foot and Heyward.

Rank \n                         two, present! Rank two, hold!\n\n               He grabs a partially loaded musket, the ramrod still in the \n               barrel. They're taking fire.\n\n               Men are dying. They're being pushed back.\n\n               AN ABNAKI\n\n               wearing a large cross, attacks Heyward from the side. One-\n               handed, Heyward fires the musket into the man's chest, sending \n               the ramrod through him. Then Heyward's shot in the thigh and \n               a thrown tomahawk hits him in the head and knocks him \n               sideways.\n\n               Dazed. Barely able to stand. He uses the musket as a cane \n               and...\n\n                                     HEYWARD\n                         Rank two, six paces back! Rank one, \n                         present!\n\n               Rank two did not retreat six paces. They stand in confusion. \n               Heyward looks to see what's wrong.\n\n               HEYWARD'S POV: THE REMNANTS OF THE 33RD REGIMENT OF FOOT\n\n               are standing in water. They're up against Lake George. Their \n               backs are to the wall. Last stand. Heyward straightens.\n\n               TWO FRENCH OFFICERS\n\n               on horseback try to intercede in the slaughter of five women. \n               One French officer is shot by a Huron. The other French \n               officer runs through that Huron and shoots the second.\n\n               Then his horse is shot out from under him and he goes down...\n\n               JESUIT\n\n               pleads with an Abnaki to give up a child he's holding by the \n               legs in one hand. He offers his cross. The Abnaki throws the \n               baby to the Jesuit, Pere Roubaud.\n\n               UNCAS\n\n               sees a flash of something yellow. So does Hawkeye. They charge \n               into the swirling chaos of attacking bodies. As we lose sight \n               of them...\n\n               ALICE\n\n               on her hands and knees. A massive Ottawa pulls her upright \n               by her hair about to take her life and her scalp.  He's struck \n               by a rock in the hands of Cora which barely phases him. He \n               bats her aside and returns to Alice, when suddenly...\n\n               OTTAWA WARRIOR\n\n               is spun, punched and tomahawked into the ground by Hawkeye. \n               Uncas has Alice and Cora...\n\f\n\n               TWO RANGERS AND A MOHAWK WARRIOR\n\n               from the earlier group are nearby. They combine with Hawkeye \n               to fight their way out with bayonets and tomahawks.\n\n               HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO RANGERS, A MOHAWK & MUNRO'S \n               DAUGHTERS\n\n               back through the swirling smoke. There seems to be a lull. \n               Then they're hit from the side by musket fire. One of the \n               Rangers is shot, the other wounded. Hurons attack. The Mohawk \n               supports the wounded Ranger.\n\n               HAWKEYE\n\n               shields Cora as they back up.\n\n               CHINGACHGOOK\n\n               smashing his war club straight down on a Huron, reaches for \n               the man's musket and shoots another. Then he sees...\n\n               SMOKE DRIFTING OVER WATER\n\n               It's glass-smooth. And the bows are barely visible of three \n               or four Huron war canoes.\n\n               THE SHALLOWS\n\n               HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK, UNCAS, CORA, ALICE, THE RANGER & THE \n               MOHAWK back into the water. They're pursued by Ottawa and \n               Hurons as they fight their way to the canoes.\n\n               CORA\n\n               held up by Hawkeye, suddenly screams.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               something underwater is pulling her down. An Ottawa brave \n               rockets out of the shallows. Before he's erect, Hawkeye slams \n               him back into the water and FIRES.\n\n               WOUNDED RANGER\n\n               has shoved a large birch canoe at them.\n\n               HAWKEYE\n\n               Suddenly, the Mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to \n               face Hawkeye. His hands rest on Hawkeye's shoulders. Hawkeye \n               looks into his face. Tries to hold him up, tries to rescue \n               him. A frozen moment. Hawkeye's staring into his eyes and \n               the man is staring into Hawkeye's as the light goes out...  \n               Hawkeye lets him slide into the water and float away. He \n               moves Cora and Alice towards the canoe...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. LAKE GEORGE - DAY\n\n               WATER & SWIRLING SMOKE\n\n               the bottom of the frame is water like glass. Smoke obscures \n               the background. Fingers tendril towards us. Out of the mist \n               we HEAR small splashing and then the high bow of a war canoe \n               defines itself. It's paddled towards us.\n\n               HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS\n\n               Cora's behind Hawkeye. Alice and the wounded Ranger are near \n               Uncas.\n\n               CLOSER: HAWKEYE & CORA\n\n               Cora looks left.

Heyward's \n               aiming a horse pistol at Hawkeye.\n\n               HAWKEYE\n\n               is non-plussed. He doesn't stop paddling.\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         You got nothin' better to do today \n                         on Lake George than shoot me, Major, \n                         then go ahead...\n\n               Heyward's a hair's breadth from firing. Suddenly they hear \n               the boom of muskets and rounds come in.\n\n               WIDE\n\n               They're being pursued by three boatloads - and then a fourth \n               and fifth - of Huron.\n\n               HEYWARD\n\n               is indifferent to Huron musket balls. Hawkeye hasn't stopped \n               paddling and pays Heyward no heed.\n\n                                     CORA\n                         Stop it!!\n\n               Heyward comes to his senses. His head is gashed. A scarf, as \n               a tourniquet, is tied around his leg. He lowers the gun.\n\n                                     HEYWARD\n                         When you fall into British hands \n                         again, Nathaniel Poe, I will have \n                         you hanged.\n\n               HURON CANOES\n\n               paddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake.\n\n               HAWKEYE & HEYWARD'S CANOES\n\n               with less paddlers, plus wounded, are slower and will be \n               overtaken.\n\n               HAWKEYE\n\n               looks to Uncas. They both realize the same thing. Hawkeye \n               nods and he, Uncas & Chingachgook begin to paddle furiously. \n               The others match the doubled pace. They're sprinting ahead \n               but the effort is exhausting.\n\n               HURON CANOES\n\n               maintain their steady pace. Three or four Hurons fire.\n\n               HAWKEYE'S CANOE\n\n               Musket balls ricochet on the water's surface. One rips a \n               hole through the bow.\n\n               Hawkeye sees one of the Redcoats in Heyward's canoe is giving \n               out...\n\n                                     REDCOAT #1\n                         Can't... keep it up...\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         Pull!\n\n               He renews the attack on the water with the paddle.\n\n                                     HEYWARD\n                              (shouts)\n                         How long?\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                              (shouts)\n                         Only chance we got is...\n                              (breathless)\n                         ... to get more distance on 'em and \n                         go to ground!\n\n               Heyward digs in. Like firecrackers in the distance, Huron \n               muskets sound. A new hail of musket balls cut the fabric of \n               the canoes. One Redcoat is shot in the back.

They've been waiting a \n               long time. In the perimeter warriors keep Huron at bay for \n               some reason. We see Magua. He stands apart. They wait.

But it is the Huron path that \n                         Magua walks down, not the French \n                         one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear \n                         Huron. That is good. When the Huron \n                         is strong from their fear, we will \n                         make the terms of trade with Les \n                         Francais. And we will trade as the \n                         white man trades. Take land from the \n                         Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & \n                         Fox. And make the Huron great. Over \n                         other tribes.

Next to it is Uncas' burial platform. \n               Cora [says a] silent prayer. Then she pauses, crosses herself. \n               Her emotions are spent. She moves next to Hawkeye. He takes \n               her hand.\n\n               HAWKEYE & CORA\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         Will you go back to England?\n\n                                     CORA\n                         I have nothing to go back for.\n\n               Long pause.\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         Then will you stay in America?\n\n               She turns to face him.\n\n                                     HAWKEYE\n                         And will you be my wife?\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     CORA\n                         Yes.\n\n               They hold each other's eyes.
