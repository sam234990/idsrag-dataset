Indeed,\nthere is no one left belonging to her by whom the indulgence of such a\nhope on her behalf could be cherished. Friends she has none; and her\nown condition is such, that she recks nothing of confinement and does\nnot even sigh for release. And yet her mind is ever at work,--as is\ndoubtless always the case with the insane. She has present to her,\napparently in every waking moment of her existence, an object of intense\ninterest, and at that she works with a constancy which never wearies\nherself, however fatiguing it may be to those who are near her. She is\never justifying some past action of her life. \"An eye for an eye,\" she\nsays, \"and a tooth for a tooth. Is it not the law?\" And these words she\nwill repeat daily, almost from morn till night.\n\nIt has been said that this poor lady has no friends. Friends who would\nbe anxious for her recovery, who would care to see her even in her\nwretched condition, who might try to soothe her harassed heart with\nwords of love, she has none. Such is her condition now, and her\ntemperament, that it may be doubted whether any words of love, however\ntender, could be efficacious with her. She is always demanding\njustification, and as those who are around her never thwart her she has\nprobably all the solace which kindness could give her.\n\nBut, though she has no friends--none who love her,--she has all the\nmaterial comfort which friendship or even love could supply. All that\nmoney can do to lessen her misery, is done. The house in which she lives\nis surrounded by soft lawns and secluded groves. It has been prepared\naltogether for the wealthy, and is furnished with every luxury which\nit may be within the power of a maniac to enjoy. This lady has her own\nwoman to attend her; and the woman, though stout and masterful, is\ngentle in language and kind in treatment. \"An eye for an eye, ma'am. Oh,\ncertainly. That is the law. An eye for an eye, no doubt.\" This formula\nshe will repeat a dozen times a day--ay, a dozen dozen times, till the\nwonder is that she also should not be mad.\n\nThe reader need not fear that he is to be asked to loiter within the\nprecincts of an asylum for the insane. Of this abode of wretchedness no\nword more shall be said; but the story shall be told of the lady who\ndwelt there,--the story of her life till madness placed her within those\nwalls. That story was known to none at the establishment but to him who\nwas its head. Others there, who were cognisant of the condition of the\nvarious patients, only knew that from quarter to quarter the charges for\nthis poor lady's custody were defrayed by the Earl of Scroope.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nSCROOPE MANOR.\n\n\nSome years ago, it matters not how many, the old Earl of Scroope lived\nat Scroope Manor in Dorsetshire. The house was an Elizabethan structure\nof some pretensions, but of no fame. It was not known to sight-seers,\nas are so many of the residences of our nobility and country gentlemen.\nNo days in the week were appointed for visiting its glories, nor was\nthe housekeeper supposed to have a good thing in perquisites from\nshowing it. It was a large brick building facing on to the village\nstreet,--facing the village, if the hall-door of a house be the main\ncharacteristic of its face; but with a front on to its own grounds from\nwhich opened the windows of the chief apartments. The village of Scroope\nconsisted of a straggling street a mile in length, with the church and\nparsonage at one end, and the Manor-house almost at the other. But\nthe church stood within the park; and on that side of the street, for\nmore than half its length, the high, gloomy wall of the Earl's domain\nstretched along in face of the publicans, bakers, grocers, two butchers,\nand retired private residents whose almost contiguous houses made\nScroope itself seem to be more than a village to strangers. Close to the\nManor and again near to the church, some favoured few had been allowed\nto build houses and to cultivate small gardens taken, as it were, in\nnotches out of the Manor grounds; but these tenements must have been\nbuilt at a time in which landowners were very much less jealous than\nthey are now of such encroachments from their humbler neighbours.\n\nThe park itself was large, and the appendages to it such as were fit\nfor an Earl's establishment;--but there was little about it that was\nattractive. The land lay flat, and the timber, which was very plentiful,\nhad not been made to group itself in picturesque forms. There was the\nManor wood, containing some five hundred acres, lying beyond the church\nand far back from the road, intersected with so-called drives, which\nwere unfit for any wheels but those of timber waggons;--and round the\nwhole park there was a broad belt of trees. Here and there about the\nlarge enclosed spaces there stood solitary oaks, in which the old Earl\ntook pride; but at Scroope Manor there was none of that finished\nlandscape beauty of which the owners of \"places\" in England are so\njustly proud.\n\nThe house was large, and the rooms were grand and spacious. There was an\nenormous hall into one corner of which the front door opened. There was\na vast library filled with old books which no one ever touched,--huge\nvolumes of antiquated and now all but useless theology, and folio\neditions of the least known classics,--such as men now never read. Not a\nbook had been added to it since the commencement of the century, and it\nmay almost be said that no book had been drawn from its shelves for real\nuse during the same period. There was a suite of rooms,--a salon with\ntwo withdrawing rooms which now were never opened. The big dining-room\nwas used occasionally, as, in accordance with the traditions of the\nfamily, dinner was served there whenever there were guests at the Manor.\nGuests, indeed, at Scroope Manor were not very frequent;--but Lady\nScroope did occasionally have a friend or two to stay with her; and\nat long intervals the country clergymen and neighbouring squires were\nasked, with their wives, to dinner. When the Earl and his Countess were\nalone they used a small breakfast parlour, and between this and the big\ndining-room there was the little chamber in which the Countess usually\nlived. The Earl's own room was at the back, or if the reader pleases,\nfront of the house, near the door leading into the street, and was, of\nall rooms in the house, the gloomiest.\n\nThe atmosphere of the whole place was gloomy. There were none of those\ncharms of modern creation which now make the mansions of the wealthy\namong us bright and joyous. There was not a billiard table in the\nhouse. There was no conservatory nearer than the large old-fashioned\ngreenhouse, which stood away by the kitchen garden and which seemed to\nbelong exclusively to the gardener. The papers on the walls were dark\nand sombre. The mirrors were small and lustreless. The carpets were old\nand dingy. The windows did not open on to the terrace. The furniture was\nhardly ancient, but yet antiquated and uncomfortable. Throughout the\nhouse, and indeed throughout the estate, there was sufficient evidence\nof wealth; and there certainly was no evidence of parsimony; but at\nScroope Manor money seemed never to have produced luxury. The household\nwas very large. There was a butler, and a housekeeper, and various\nfootmen, and a cook with large wages, and maidens in tribes to wait upon\neach other, and a colony of gardeners, and a coachman, and a head-groom,\nand under-grooms. All these lived well under the old Earl, and knew the\nvalue of their privileges. There was much to get, and almost nothing\nto do. A servant might live for ever at Scroope Manor,--if only\nsufficiently submissive to Mrs. Bunce the housekeeper. There was\ncertainly no parsimony at the Manor, but the luxurious living of the\nhousehold was confined to the servants' department.\n\nTo a stranger, and perhaps also to the inmates, the idea of gloom about\nthe place was greatly increased by the absence of any garden or lawn\nnear the house. Immediately in front of the mansion, and between it and\nthe park, there ran two broad gravel terraces, one above another; and\nbelow these the deer would come and browse. To the left of the house,\nat nearly a quarter of a mile distant from it, there was a very large\ngarden indeed,--flower-gardens, and kitchen-gardens, and orchards; all\nugly, and old-fashioned, but producing excellent crops in their kind.\nBut they were away, and were not seen. Oat flowers were occasionally\nbrought into the house,--but the place was never filled with flowers\nas country houses are filled with them now-a-days. No doubt had Lady\nScroope wished for more she might have had more.\n\nScroope itself, though a large village, stood a good deal out of the\nworld. Within the last year or two a railway has been opened, with a\nScroope Road Station, not above three miles from the place; but in\nthe old lord's time it was eleven miles from its nearest station, at\nDorchester, with which it had communication once a day by an omnibus.\nUnless a man had business with Scroope nothing would take him there; and\nvery few people had business with Scroope. Now and then a commercial\ntraveller would visit the place with but faint hopes as to trade. A\npost-office inspector once in twelve months would call upon plethoric\nold Mrs. Applejohn, who kept the small shop for stationery, and was\nknown as the postmistress. The two sons of the vicar, Mr. Greenmarsh,\nwould pass backwards and forwards between their father's vicarage and\nMarlbro' school. And occasionally the men and women of Scroope would\nmake a journey to their county town. But the Earl was told that old Mrs.\nBrock of the Scroope Arms could not keep the omnibus on the road unless\nhe would subscribe to aid it. Of course he subscribed. If he had been\ntold by his steward to subscribe to keep the cap on Mrs. Brock's head,\nhe would have done so. Twelve pounds a year his Lordship paid towards\nthe omnibus, and Scroope was not absolutely dissevered from the world.\n\nThe Earl himself was never seen out of his own domain, except when\nhe attended church. This he did twice every Sunday in the year, the\ncoachman driving him there in the morning and the head-groom in the\nafternoon. Throughout the household it was known to be the Earl's\nrequest to his servants that they would attend divine service at least\nonce every Sunday. None were taken into service but they who were or\nwho called themselves members of the Church Establishment. It is hardly\nprobable that many dissenters threw away the chance of such promotion on\nany frivolous pretext of religion. Beyond this request, which, coming\nfrom the mouth of Mrs. Bunce, became very imperative, the Earl hardly\never interfered with his domestics. His own valet had attended him for\nthe last thirty years; but, beyond his valet and the butler, he hardly\nknew the face of one of them. There was a gamekeeper at Scroope Manor,\nwith two under-gamekeepers; and yet, for, some years, no one, except the\ngamekeepers, had ever shot over the lands. Some partridges and a few\npheasants were, however, sent into the house when Mrs. Bunce, moved to\nwrath, would speak her mind on that subject.\n\nThe Earl of Scroope himself was a tall, thin man, something over seventy\nat the time of which I will now begin to speak. His shoulders were much\nbent, but otherwise he appeared to be younger than his age. His hair was\nnearly white, but his eyes were still bright, and the handsome well-cut\nfeatures of his fine face were not reduced to shapelessness by any of\nthe ravages of time, as is so often the case with men who are infirm as\nwell as old. Were it not for the long and heavy eyebrows, which gave\nsomething of severity to his face, and for that painful stoop in his\nshoulders, he might still have been accounted a handsome man. In youth\nhe had been a very handsome man, and had shone forth in the world,\npopular, beloved, respected, with all the good things the world could\ngive. The first blow upon him was the death of his wife. That hurt him\nsorely, but it did not quite crush him. Then his only daughter died\nalso, just as she became a bride. High as the Lady Blanche Neville\nhad stood herself, she had married almost above her rank, and her\nfather's heart had been full of joy and pride. But she had perished\nchildless,--in child-birth, and again he was hurt almost to death. There\nwas still left to him a son,--a youth indeed thoughtless, lavish, and\nprone to evil pleasures. But thought would come with years; for almost\nany lavishness there were means sufficient; and evil pleasures might\ncease to entice. The young Lord Neville was all that was left to the\nEarl, and for his heir he paid debts and forgave injuries. The young\nman would marry and all might be well. Then he found a bride for his\nboy,--with no wealth, but owning the best blood in the kingdom, beautiful,\ngood, one who might be to him as another daughter. His boy's answer was\nthat he was already married! He had chosen his wife from out of the\nstreets, and offered to the Earl of Scroope as a child to replace the\ndaughter who had gone, a wretched painted prostitute from France. After\nthat Lord Scroope never again held up his head.\n\nThe father would not see his heir,--and never saw him again. As to what\nmoney might be needed, the lawyers in London were told to manage that.\nThe Earl himself would give nothing and refuse nothing. When there were\ndebts,--debts for the second time, debts for the third time, the lawyers\nwere instructed to do what in their own eyes seemed good to them. They\nmight pay as long as they deemed it right to pay, but they might not\nname Lord Neville to his father.\n\nWhile things were thus the Earl married again,--the penniless daughter\nof a noble house,--a woman not young, for she was forty when he married\nher, but more than twenty years his junior. It sufficed for him that she\nwas noble, and as he believed good. Good to him she was,--with a duty\nthat was almost excessive. Religious she was, and self-denying; giving\nmuch and demanding little; keeping herself in the background, but\npossessing wonderful energy in the service of others. Whether she could\nin truth be called good the reader may say when he has finished this\nstory.\n\nThen, when the Earl had been married some three years to his second\nwife, the heir died. He died, and as far as Scroope Manor was concerned\nthere was an end of him and of the creature he had called his wife.\nAn annuity was purchased for her. That she should be entitled to call\nherself Lady Neville while she lived, was the sad necessity of the\ncondition. It was understood by all who came near the Earl that no one\nwas to mention her within his hearing. He was thankful that no heir had\ncome from that most horrid union. The woman was never mentioned to him\nagain, nor need she trouble us further in the telling of our chronicle.\n\nBut when Lord Neville died, it was necessary that the old man should\nthink of his new heir. Alas; in that family, though there was much that\nwas good and noble, there had ever been intestine feuds,--causes of\nquarrel in which each party would be sure that he was right. They were\na people who thought much of the church, who were good to the poor, who\nstrove to be noble;--but they could not forgive injuries. They could\nnot forgive even when there were no injuries. The present Earl had\nquarrelled with his brother in early life;--and had therefore quarrelled\nwith all that had belonged to the brother. The brother was now gone,\nleaving two sons behind him,--two young Nevilles, Fred and Jack, of whom\nFred, the eldest, was now the heir. It was at last settled that Fred\nshould be sent for to Scroope Manor. Fred came, being at that time a\nlieutenant in a cavalry regiment,--a fine handsome youth of five and\ntwenty, with the Neville eyes and Neville finely cut features. Kindly\nletters passed between the widowed mother and the present Lady Scroope;\nand it was decided at last, at his own request, that he should remain\none year longer in the army, and then be installed as the eldest son at\nScroope Manor. Again the lawyer was told to do what was proper in regard\nto money.\n\nA few words more must be said of Lady Scroope, and then the preface to\nour story will be over. She too was an Earl's daughter, and had been\nmuch loved by our Earl's first wife. Lady Scroope had been the elder by\nten years; but yet they had been dear friends, and Lady Mary Wycombe had\npassed many months of her early life amidst the gloom of the great rooms\nat Scroope Manor. She had thus known the Earl well before she consented\nto marry him. She had never possessed beauty,--and hardly grace. She was\nstrong featured, tall, with pride clearly written in her face. A reader\nof faces would have declared at once that she was proud of the blood\nwhich ran in her veins. She was very proud of her blood, and did in\ntruth believe that noble birth was a greater gift than any wealth. She\nwas thoroughly able to look down upon a parvenu millionaire,--to look\ndown upon such a one and not to pretend to despise him. When the Earl's\nletter came to her asking her to share his gloom, she was as poor as\nCharity,--dependent on a poor brother who hated the burden of such\nclaim. But she would have wedded no commoner, let his wealth and age\nhave been as they might. She knew Lord Scroope's age, and she knew the\ngloom of Scroope Manor;--and she became his wife. To her of course was\ntold the story of the heir's marriage, and she knew that she could\nexpect no light, no joy in the old house from the scions of the rising\nfamily. But now all this was changed, and it might be that she could\ntake the new heir to her heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nFRED NEVILLE.\n\n\nWhen Fred Neville first came to the Manor, the old Earl trembled when\ncalled upon to receive him. Of the lad he had heard almost nothing,--of\nhis appearance literally nothing. It might be that his heir would be\nmeanly visaged, a youth of whom he would have cause to be ashamed,\none from whose countenance no sign of high blood would shine out; or,\nalmost worse, he also might have that look, half of vanity, and half\nof vice, of which the father had gradually become aware in his own\nson, and which in him had degraded the Neville beauty. But Fred, to\nlook at, was a gallant fellow,--such a youth as women love to see\nabout a house,--well-made, active, quick, self-asserting, fair-haired,\nblue-eyed, short-lipped, with small whiskers, thinking but little of his\nown personal advantages, but thinking much of his own way. As far as the\nappearance of the young man went the Earl could not but be satisfied.\nAnd to him, at any rate in this, the beginning of their connexion, Fred\nNeville was modest and submissive. \"You are welcome to Scroope,\" said\nthe old man, receiving him with stately urbanity in the middle of the\nhall. \"I am so much obliged to you, uncle,\" he said. \"You are come to\nme as a son, my boy,--as a son. It will be your own fault if you are\nnot a son to us in everything.\" Then in lieu of further words there\nshone a tear in each of the young man's eyes, much more eloquent to the\nEarl than could have been any words. He put his arm over his nephew's\nshoulders, and in this guise walked with him into the room in which Lady\nScroope was awaiting them. \"Mary,\" he said to his wife, \"here is our\nheir. Let him be a son to us.\" Then Lady Scroope took the young man\nin her arms and kissed him. Thus auspiciously was commenced this new\nconnexion.\n\nThe arrival was in September, and the game-keeper, with the under\ngamekeeper, had for the last month been told to be on his mettle. Young\nMr. Neville was no doubt a sportsman. And the old groom had been warned\nthat hunters might be wanted in the stables next winter. Mrs. Bunce\nwas made to understand that liberties would probably be taken with the\nhouse, such as had not yet been perpetrated in her time;--for the late\nheir had never made the Manor his home from the time of his leaving\nschool. It was felt by all that great changes were to be effected,--and\nit was felt also that the young man on whose behalf all this was to be\npermitted, could not but be elated by his position. Of such elation,\nhowever, there were not many signs. To his uncle, Fred Neville was, as\nhas been said, modest and submissive; to his aunt he was gentle but not\nsubmissive. The rest of the household he treated civilly, but with none\nof that awe which was perhaps expected from him. As for shooting, he\nhad come direct from his friend Carnaby's moor. Carnaby had forest\nas well as moor, and Fred thought but little of partridges,--little\nof such old-fashioned partridge-shooting as was prepared for him at\nScroope,--after grouse and deer. As for hunting in Dorsetshire, if his\nuncle wished it,--why in that case he would think of it. According to\nhis ideas, Dorsetshire was not the best county in England for hunting.\nLast year his regiment had been at Bristol and he had ridden with the\nDuke's hounds. This winter he was to be stationed in Ireland, and he had\nan idea that Irish hunting was good. If he found that his uncle made\na point of it, he would bring his horses to Scroope for a month at\nChristmas. Thus he spoke to the head groom,--and thus he spoke also to\nhis aunt, who felt some surprise when he talked of Scotland and his\nhorses. She had thought that only men of large fortunes shot deer and\nkept studs,--and perhaps conceived that the officers of the 20th Hussars\nwere generally engaged in looking after the affairs of their regiment,\nand in preparation for meeting the enemy.\n\nFred now remained a month at Scroope, and during that time there was but\nlittle personal intercourse between him and his uncle in spite of the\naffectionate greeting with which their acquaintance had been commenced.\nThe old man's habits of life were so confirmed that he could not bring\nhimself to alter them. Throughout the entire morning he would sit in\nhis own room alone. He would then be visited by his steward, his groom,\nand his butler;--and would think that he gave his orders, submitting,\nhowever, in almost every thing to them. His wife would sometimes sit\nwith him for half an hour, holding his hand, in moments of tenderness\nunseen and unsuspected by all the world around them. Sometimes the\nclergyman of the parish would come to him, so that he might know the\nwants of the people. He would have the newspaper in his hands for\na while, and would daily read the Bible for an hour. Then he would\nslowly write some letter, almost measuring every point which his pen\nmade,--thinking that thus he was performing his duty as a man of\nbusiness. Few men perhaps did less,--but what he did do was good; and\nof self-indulgence there was surely none. Between such a one and the\nyoung man who had now come to his house there could be but little real\nconnexion.\n\nBetween Fred Neville and Lady Scroope there arose a much closer\nintimacy. A woman can get nearer to a young man than can any old\nman;--can learn more of his ways, and better understand his wishes. From\nthe very first there arose between them a matter of difference, as to\nwhich there was no quarrel, but very much of argument. In that argument\nLady Scroope was unable to prevail. She was very anxious that the heir\nshould at once abandon his profession and sell out of the army. Of what\nuse could it be to him now to run after his regiment to Ireland, seeing\nthat undoubtedly the great duties of his life all centred at Scroope?\nThere were many discussions on the subject, but Fred would not give\nway in regard to the next year. He would have this year, he said, to\nhimself;--and after that he would come and settle himself at Scroope.\nYes; no doubt he would marry as soon as he could find a fitting wife. Of\ncourse it would be right that he should marry. He fully understood the\nresponsibilities of his position;--so he said, in answer to his aunt's\neager, scrutinising, beseeching questions. But as he had joined his\nregiment, he thought it would be good for him to remain with it one year\nlonger. He particularly desired to see something of Ireland, and if he\ndid not do so now, he would never have the opportunity. Lady Scroope,\nunderstanding well that he was pleading for a year of grace from the\ndulness of the Manor, explained to him that his uncle would by no means\nexpect that he should remain always at Scroope. If he would marry,\nthe old London house should be prepared for him and his bride. He\nmight travel,--not, however, going very far afield. He might get into\nParliament; as to which, if such were his ambition, his uncle would give\nhim every aid. He might have his friends at Scroope Manor,--Carnaby and\nall the rest of them. Every allurement was offered to him. But he had\ncommenced by claiming a year of grace, and to that claim he adhered.\n\nCould his uncle have brought himself to make the request in person, at\nfirst, he might probably have succeeded;--and had he succeeded, there\nwould have been no story for us as to the fortunes of Scroope Manor. But\nthe Earl was too proud and perhaps too diffident to make the attempt.\nFrom his wife he heard all that took place; and though he was grieved,\nhe expressed no anger. He could not feel himself justified in expressing\nanger because his nephew chose to remain for yet a year attached to his\nprofession. \"Who knows what may happen to him?\" said the Countess.\n\n\"Ah, indeed! But we are all in the hands of the Almighty.\" And the\nEarl bowed his head. Lady Scroope, fully recognizing the truth of her\nhusband's pious ejaculation, nevertheless thought that human care might\nadvantageously be added to the divine interposition for which, as she\nwell knew, her lord prayed fervently as soon as the words were out of\nhis mouth.\n\n\"But it would be so great a thing if he could be settled. Sophia\nMellerby has promised to come here for a couple of months in the winter.\nHe could not possibly do better than that.\"\n\n\"The Mellerbys are very good people,\" said the Earl. \"Her grandmother,\nthe duchess, is one of the very best women in England. Her mother, Lady\nSophia, is an excellent creature,--religious, and with the soundest\nprinciples. Mr. Mellerby, as a commoner, stands as high as any man in\nEngland.\"\n\n\"They have held the same property since the wars of the roses. And then\nI suppose the money should count for something,\" added the lady.\n\nLord Scroope would not admit the importance of the money, but was quite\nwilling to acknowledge that were his heir to make Sophia Mellerby the\nfuture Lady Scroope he would be content. But he could not interfere.\nHe did not think it wise to speak to young men on such a subject. He\nthought that by doing so a young man might be rather diverted from than\nattracted to the object in view. Nor would he press his wishes upon his\nnephew as to next year. \"Were I to ask it,\" he said, \"and were he to\nrefuse me, I should be hurt. I am bound therefore to ask nothing that\nis unreasonable.\" Lady Scroope did not quite agree with her husband\nin this. She thought that as every thing was to be done for the young\nman; as money almost without stint was to be placed at his command; as\nhunting, parliament, and a house in London were offered to him;--as\nthe treatment due to a dear and only son was shown to him, he ought to\ngive something in return; but she herself, could say no more than she\nhad said, and she knew already that in those few matters in which her\nhusband had a decided will, he was not to be turned from it.\n\nIt was arranged, therefore, that Fred Neville should join his regiment\nat Limerick in October, and that he should come home to Scroope for a\nfortnight or three weeks at Christmas. Sophia Mellerby was to be Lady\nScroope's guest at that time, and at last it was decided that Mrs.\nNeville, who had never been seen by the Earl, should be asked to\ncome and bring with her her younger son, John Neville, who had been\nsuccessful in obtaining a commission in the Engineers. Other guests\nshould be invited, and an attempt should be made to remove the mantle\nof gloom from Scroope Manor,--with the sole object of ingratiating the\nheir.\n\nEarly in October Fred went to Limerick, and from thence with a detached\ntroop of his regiment he was sent to the cavalry barracks at Ennis, the\nassize town of the neighbouring County Clare. This was at first held to\nbe a misfortune by him, as Limerick is in all respects a better town\nthan Ennis, and in County Limerick the hunting is far from being bad,\nwhereas Clare is hardly a country for a Nimrod. But a young man, with\nmoney at command, need not regard distances; and the Limerick balls and\nthe Limerick coverts were found to be equally within reach. From Ennis\nalso he could attend some of the Galway meets,--and then with no other\nsuperior than a captain hardly older than himself to interfere with\nhis movements, he could indulge in that wild district the spirit of\nadventure which was strong within him. When young men are anxious to\nindulge the spirit of adventure, they generally do so by falling in love\nwith young women of whom their fathers and mothers would not approve. In\nthese days a spirit of adventure hardly goes further than this, unless\nit take a young man to a German gambling table.\n\nWhen Fred left Scroope it was understood that he was to correspond\nwith his aunt. The Earl would have been utterly lost had he attempted\nto write a letter to his nephew without having something special to\ncommunicate to him. But Lady Scroope was more facile with her pen,\nand it was rightly thought that the heir would hardly bring himself\nto look upon Scroope as his home, unless some link were maintained\nbetween himself and the place. Lady Scroope therefore wrote once a\nweek,--telling everything that there was to be told of the horses, the\ngame, and even of the tenants. She studied her letters, endeavouring to\nmake them light and agreeable,--such as a young man of large prospects\nwould like to receive from his own mother. He was \"Dearest Fred,\" and\nin one of those earliest written she expressed a hope that should any\ntrouble ever fall upon him he would come to her as to his dearest\nfriend. Fred was not a bad correspondent, and answered about every other\nletter. His replies were short, but that was a matter of course. He was\n\"as jolly as a sandboy,\" \"right as a trivet;\" had had \"one or two very\ngood things,\" and thought that upon the whole he liked Ennis better than\nLimerick. \"Johnstone is such a deuced good fellow!\" Johnstone was the\ncaptain of the 20th Hussars who happened to be stationed with him at\nLimerick. Lady Scroope did not quite like the epithet, but she knew\nthat she had to learn to hear things to which she had hitherto not been\naccustomed.\n\nThis was all very well;--but Lady Scroope, having a friend in Co. Clare,\nthought that she might receive tidings of the adopted one which would be\nuseful, and with this object she opened a correspondence with Lady Mary\nQuin. Lady Mary Quin was a daughter of the Earl of Kilfenora, and was\nwell acquainted with all County Clare. She was almost sure to hear of\nthe doings of any officers stationed at Ennis, and would do so certainly\nin regard to an officer that was specially introduced to her. Fred\nNeville was invited to stay at Castle Quin as long as he pleased, and\nactually did pass one night under its roof. But, unfortunately for him,\nthat spirit of adventure which he was determined to indulge led him into\nthe neighbourhood of Castle Quin when it was far from his intention to\ninterfere with the Earl or with Lady Mary, and thus led to the following\nletter which Lady Scroope received about the middle of December,--just a\nweek before Fred's return to the Manor.\n\n\n   QUIN CASTLE, ENNISTIMON,\n   14 December, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAR LADY SCROOPE,\n\n   Since I wrote to you before, Mr. Neville has been here once, and we\n   all liked him very much. My father was quite taken with him. He is\n   always fond of the young officers, and is not the less inclined to\n   be so of one who is so dear and near to you. I wish he would have\n   stayed longer, and hope that he shall come again. We have not much\n   to offer in the way of amusement, but in January and February there\n   is good snipe shooting.\n\n   I find that Mr. Neville is very fond of shooting,--so much so that\n   before we knew anything of him except his name we had heard that he\n   had been on our coast after seals and sea birds. We have very high\n   cliffs near here,--some people say the highest in the world, and\n   there is one called the Hag's Head from which men get down and\n   shoot sea-gulls. He has been different times in our village of\n   Liscannor, and I think he has a boat there or at Lahinch. I believe\n   he has already killed ever so many seals.\n\n   I tell you all this for a reason. I hope that it may come to\n   nothing, but I think that you ought to know. There is a widow lady\n   living not very far from Liscannor, but nearer up to the cliffs.\n   Her cottage is on papa's property, but I think she holds it from\n   somebody else. I don't like to say anything to papa about it. Her\n   name is Mrs. O'Hara, and she has a daughter.\n\n\nWhen Lady Scroope had read so far, she almost let the paper drop from\nher hand. Of course she knew what it all meant. An Irish Miss O'Hara!\nAnd Fred Neville was spending his time in pursuit of this girl! Lady\nScroope had known what it would be when the young man was allowed to\nreturn to his regiment in spite of the manifold duties which should have\nbound him to Scroope Manor.\n\n\n   I have seen this young lady,\n\n\ncontinued Lady Mary,\n\n\n   and she is certainly very pretty. But nobody knows anything about\n   them; and I cannot even learn whether they belong to the real\n   O'Haras. I should think not, as they are Roman Catholics. At\n   any rate Miss O'Hara can hardly be a fitting companion for Lord\n   Scroope's heir. I believe they are ladies, but I don't think that\n   any one knows them here, except the priest of Kilmacrenny. We never\n   could make out quite why they came here,--only that Father Marty\n   knows something about them. He is the priest of Kilmacrenny. She is\n   a very pretty girl, and I never heard a word against her;--but I\n   don't know whether that does not make it worse, because a young man\n   is so likely to get entangled.\n\n   I daresay nothing shall come of it, and I'm sure I hope that\n   nothing may. But I thought it best to tell you. Pray do not let him\n   know that you have heard from me. Young men are so very particular\n   about things, and I don't know what he might say of me if he knew\n   that I had written home to you about his private affairs. All the\n   same if I can be of any service to you, pray let me know. Excuse\n   haste. And believe me to be,\n\n   Yours most sincerely,\n\n   MARY QUIN.\n\n\nA Roman Catholic;--one whom no one knew but the priest;--a girl who\nperhaps never had a father! All this was terrible to Lady Scroope. Roman\nCatholics,--and especially Irish Roman Catholics,--were people whom,\nas she thought, every one should fear in this world, and for whom\neverything was to be feared in the next. How would it be with the Earl\nif this heir also were to tell him some day that he was married? Would\nnot his grey hairs be brought to the grave with a double load of sorrow?\nHowever, for the present she thought it better to say not a word to the\nEarl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nSOPHIE MELLERBY.\n\n\nLady Scroope thought a great deal about her friend's communication, but\nat last made up her mind that she could do nothing till Fred should have\nreturned. Indeed she hardly knew what she could do when he did come\nback. The more she considered it the greater seemed to her to be the\ndifficulty of doing anything. How is a woman, how is even a mother, to\ncaution a young man against the danger of becoming acquainted with a\npretty girl? She could not mention Miss O'Hara's name without mentioning\nthat of Lady Mary Quin in connexion with it. And when asked, as of\ncourse she would be asked, as to her own information, what could she\nsay? She had been told that he had made himself acquainted with a widow\nlady who had a pretty daughter, and that was all! When young men will\nrun into such difficulties, it is, alas, so very difficult to interfere\nwith them!\n\nAnd yet the matter was of such importance as to justify almost any\ninterference. A Roman Catholic Irish girl of whom nothing was known but\nthat her mother was said to be a widow, was, in Lady Scroope's eyes, as\nformidable a danger as could come in the way of her husband's heir. Fred\nNeville was, she thought, with all his good qualities, exactly the man\nto fall in love with a wild Irish girl. If Fred were to write home some\nday and say that he was about to marry such a bride,--or, worse again,\nthat he had married her, the tidings would nearly kill the Earl. After\nall that had been endured, such a termination to the hopes of the family\nwould be too cruel! And Lady Scroope could not but feel the injustice of\nit. Every thing was being done for this heir, for whom nothing need have\nbeen done. He was treated as a son, but he was not a son. He was treated\nwith exceptional favour as a son. Everything was at his disposal. He\nmight marry and begin life at once with every want amply supplied, if\nhe would only marry such a woman as was fit to be a future Countess of\nScroope. Very little was required from him. He was not expected to marry\nan heiress. An heiress indeed was prepared for him, and would be there,\nready for him at Christmas,--an heiress, beautiful, well-born, fit in\nevery respect,--religious too. But he was not to be asked to marry\nSophie Mellerby. He might choose for himself. There were other well-born\nyoung women about the world,--duchesses' granddaughters in abundance!\nBut it was imperative that he should marry at least a lady, and at least\na Protestant.\n\nLady Scroope felt very strongly that he should never have been allowed\nto rejoin his regiment, when a home at Scroope was offered to him. He\nwas a free agent of course, and equally of course the title and the\nproperty must ultimately be his. But something of a bargain might have\nbeen made with him when all the privileges of a son were offered to him.\nWhen he was told that he might have all Scroope to himself,--for it\namounted nearly to that; that he might hunt there and shoot there and\nentertain his friends; that the family house in London should be given\nup to him if he would marry properly; that an income almost without\nlimit should be provided for him, surely it would not have been too much\nto demand that as a matter of course he should leave the army! But this\nhad not been done; and now there was an Irish Roman Catholic widow with\na daughter, with seal-shooting and a boat and high cliffs right in the\nyoung man's way! Lady Scroope could not analyse it, but felt all the\ndanger as though it were by instinct. Partridge and pheasant shooting\non a gentleman's own grounds, and an occasional day's hunting with the\nhounds in his own county, were, in Lady Scroope's estimation, becoming\namusements for an English gentleman. They did not interfere with the\nexercise of his duties. She had by no means brought herself to like the\nyearly raids into Scotland made latterly by sportsmen. But if Scotch\nmoors and forests were dangerous, what were Irish cliffs! Deer-stalking\nwas bad in her imagination. She was almost sure that when men went up\nto Scotch forests they did not go to church on Sundays. But the idea of\nseal-shooting was much more horrible. And then there was that priest who\nwas the only friend of the widow who had the daughter!\n\nOn the morning of the day in which Fred was to reach the Manor, Lady\nScroope did speak to her husband. \"Don't you think, my dear, that\nsomething might be done to prevent Fred's returning to that horrid\ncountry?\"\n\n\"What can we do?\"\n\n\"I suppose he would wish to oblige you. You are being very good to him.\"\n\n\"It is for the old to give, Mary, and for the young to accept. I do all\nfor him because he is all to me; but what am I to him, that he should\nsacrifice any pleasure for me? He can break my heart. Were I even to\nquarrel with him, the worst I could do would be to send him to the\nmoney-lenders for a year or two.\"\n\n\"But why should he care about his regiment now?\"\n\n\"Because his regiment means liberty.\"\n\n\"And you won't ask him to give it up?\"\n\n\"I think not. If I were to ask him I should expect him to yield, and\nthen I should be disappointed were he to refuse. I do not wish him to\nthink me a tyrant.\" This was the end of the conversation, for Lady\nScroope did not as yet dare to speak to the Earl about the widow and her\ndaughter. She must now try her skill and eloquence with the young man\nhimself.\n\nThe young man arrived and was received with kindest greetings. Two\nhorses had preceded him, so that he might find himself mounted as soon\nas he chose after his arrival, and two others were coming. This was all\nvery well, but his aunt was a little hurt when he declared his purpose\nof going down to the stables just as she told him that Sophia Mellerby\nwas in the house. He arrived on the 23rd at 4 P.M., and it had been\ndeclared that he was to hunt on the morrow. It was already dark, and\nsurely he might have been content on the first evening of his arrival to\nabstain from the stables! Not a word had been said to Sophie Mellerby\nof Lady Scroope's future hopes. Lady Scroope and Lady Sophia would each\nhave thought that it was wicked to do so. But the two women had been\nfussy, and Miss Mellerby must have been less discerning than are young\nladies generally, had she not understood what was expected of her. Girls\nare undoubtedly better prepared to fall in love with men whom they have\nnever seen, than are men with girls. It is a girl's great business in\nlife to love and to be loved. Of some young men it may almost be said\nthat it is their great business to avoid such a catastrophe. Such ought\nnot to have been the case with Fred Neville now;--but in such light he\nregarded it. He had already said to himself that Sophie Mellerby was to\nbe pitched at his head. He knew no reason,--none as yet,--why he should\nnot like Miss Mellerby well enough. But he was a little on his guard\nagainst her, and preferred seeing his horses first. Sophie, when\naccording to custom, and indeed in this instance in accordance with\nspecial arrangement, she went into Lady Scroope's sitting-room for tea,\nwas rather disappointed at not finding Mr. Neville there. She knew that\nhe had visited his uncle immediately on his arrival, and having just\ncome in from the park she had gone to her room to make some little\npreparation for the meeting. If it was written in Fate's book that she\nwas to be the next Lady Scroope, the meeting was important. Perhaps that\nwriting in Fate's book might depend on the very adjustment which she was\nnow making of her hair.\n\n\"He has gone to look at his horses,\" said Lady Scroope, unable not to\nshew her disappointment by the tone of her voice.\n\n\"That is so natural,\" said Sophie, who was more cunning. \"Young men\nalmost idolize their horses. I should like to go and see Dandy whenever\nhe arrives anywhere, only I don't dare!\" Dandy was Miss Mellerby's own\nhorse, and was accustomed to make journeys up and down between Mellerby\nand London.\n\n\"I don't think horses and guns and dogs should be too much thought of,\"\nsaid Lady Scroope gravely. \"There is a tendency I think at present to\ngive them an undue importance. When our amusements become more serious\nto us than our business, we must be going astray.\"\n\n\"I suppose we always are going astray,\" said Miss Mellerby. Lady Scroope\nsighed and shook her head; but in shaking it she shewed that she\ncompletely agreed with the opinion expressed by her guest.\n\nAs there were only two horses to be inspected, and as Fred Neville\nabsolutely refused the groom's invitation to look at the old carriage\nhorses belonging to the family, he was back in his aunt's room before\nMiss Mellerby had gone upstairs to dress for dinner. The introduction\nwas made, and Fred did his best to make himself agreeable. He was such\na man that no girl could, at the first sight of him, think herself\ninjured by being asked to love him. She was a good girl, and would have\nconsented to marry no man without feeling sure of his affections; but\nFred Neville was bold and frank as well as handsome, and had plenty to\nsay for himself. It might be that he was vicious, or ill-tempered, or\nselfish, and it would be necessary that she should know much of him\nbefore she would give herself into his keeping; but as far as the first\nsight went, and the first hearing, Sophie Mellerby's impressions were\nall in Fred's favour. It is no doubt a fact that with the very best of\ngirls a man is placed in a very good light by being heir to a peerage\nand a large property.\n\n\"Do you hunt, Miss Mellerby?\" he asked. She shook her head and looked\ngrave, and then laughed. Among her people hunting was not thought to be\na desirable accomplishment for young ladies. \"Almost all girls do hunt\nnow,\" said Fred.\n\n\"Do you think it is a nice amusement for young ladies?\" asked the aunt\nin a severe tone.\n\n\"I don't see why not;--that is if they know how to ride.\"\n\n\"I know how to ride,\" said Sophie Mellerby.\n\n\"Riding is all very well,\" said Lady Scroope. \"I quite approve of it\nfor girls. When I was young, everybody did not ride as they do now.\nNevertheless it is very well, and is thought to be healthy. But as for\nhunting, Sophie, I'm sure your mamma would be very much distressed if\nyou were to think of such a thing.\"\n\n\"But, dear Lady Scroope, I haven't thought of it, and I am not going to\nthink of it;--and if I thought of it ever so much, I shouldn't do it.\nPoor mamma would be frightened into fits,--only that nobody at Mellerby\ncould possibly be made to believe it, unless they saw me doing it.\"\n\n\"Then there can be no reason why you shouldn't make the attempt,\" said\nFred. Upon which Lady Scroope pretended to look grave, and told him that\nhe was very wicked. But let an old lady be ever so strict towards her\nown sex, she likes a little wickedness in a young man,--if only he does\nnot carry it to the extent of marrying the wrong sort of young woman.\n\nSophia Mellerby was a tall, graceful, well-formed girl, showing her high\nblood in every line of her face. On her mother's side she had come from\nthe Ancrums, whose family, as everybody knows, is one of the oldest in\nEngland; and, as the Earl had said, the Mellerbys had been Mellerbys\nfrom the time of King John, and had been living on the same spot for\nat least four centuries. They were and always had been Mellerbys of\nMellerby,--the very name of the parish being the same as that of the\nfamily. If Sophia Mellerby did not shew breeding, what girl could shew\nit? She was fair, with a somewhat thin oval face, with dark eyes, and\nan almost perfect Grecian nose. Her mouth was small, and her chin\ndelicately formed. And yet it can hardly be said that she was beautiful.\nOr, if beautiful, she was so in women's eyes rather than in those of\nmen. She lacked colour and perhaps animation in her countenance. She had\nmore character, indeed, than was told by her face, which is generally\nso true an index of the mind. Her education had been as good as England\ncould afford, and her intellect had been sufficient to enable her to\nmake use of it. But her chief charm in the eyes of many consisted in the\nfact, doubted by none, that she was every inch a lady. She was an only\ndaughter, too,--with an only brother; and as the Ancrums were all rich,\nshe would have a very pretty fortune of her own. Fred Neville, who had\nliterally been nobody before his cousin had died, might certainly do\nmuch worse than marry her.\n\nAnd after a day or two they did seem to get on very well together. He\nhad reached Scroope on the 21st, and on the 23rd Mrs. Neville arrived\nwith her youngest son Jack Neville. This was rather a trial to the Earl,\nas he had never yet seen his brother's widow. He had heard when his\nbrother married that she was fast, fond of riding, and loud. She had\nbeen the daughter of a Colonel Smith, with whom his brother, at that\ntime a Captain Neville, had formed acquaintance;--and had been a beauty\nvery well known as such at Dublin and other garrison towns. No real harm\nhad ever been known of her, but the old Earl had always felt that his\nbrother had made an unfortunate marriage. As at that time they had not\nbeen on speaking terms, it had not signified much;--but there had been a\nprejudice at Scroope against the Captain's wife, which by no means died\nout when the late Julia Smith became the Captain's widow with two sons.\nOld reminiscences remain very firm with old people,--and Lord Scroope\nwas still much afraid of the fast, loud beauty. His principles told him\nthat he should not sever the mother from the son, and that as it suited\nhim to take the son for his own purposes, he should also, to some\nextent, accept the mother also. But he dreaded the affair. He dreaded\nMrs. Neville; and he dreaded Jack, who had been so named after his\ngallant grandfather, Colonel Smith. When Mrs. Neville arrived, she was\nfound to be so subdued and tame that she could hardly open her mouth\nbefore the old Earl. Her loudness, if she ever had been loud, was\ncertainly all gone,--and her fastness, if ever she had been fast, had\nbeen worn out of her. She was an old woman, with the relics of great\nbeauty, idolizing her two sons for whom all her life had been a\nsacrifice, in weak health, and prepared, if necessary, to sit in silent\nawe at the feet of the Earl who had been so good to her boy.\n\n\"I don't know how to thank you for what you have done,\" she said, in a\nlow voice.\n\n\"No thanks are required,\" said the Earl. \"He is the same to us as if he\nwere our own.\" Then she raised the old man's hand and kissed it,--and\nthe old man owned to himself that he had made a mistake.\n\nAs to Jack Neville--. But Jack Neville shall have another chapter opened\non his behalf.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nJACK NEVILLE.\n\n\nJohn is a very respectable name;--perhaps there is no name more\nrespectable in the English language. Sir John, as the head of a family,\nis certainly as respectable as any name can be. For an old family\ncoachman it beats all names. Mr. John Smith would be sure to have a\nlarger balance at his banker's than Charles Smith or Orlando Smith,--or\nperhaps than any other Smith whatever. The Rev. Frederic Walker\nmight be a wet parson, but the Rev. John Walker would assuredly be\na good clergyman at all points, though perhaps a little dull in his\nsermons. Yet almost all Johns have been Jacks, and Jack, in point of\nrespectability, is the very reverse of John. How it is, or when it\nis, that the Jacks become re-Johned, and go back to the original and\nexcellent name given to them by their godfathers and godmothers, nobody\never knows. Jack Neville, probably through some foolish fondness on his\nmother's part, had never been re-Johned,--and consequently the Earl,\nwhen he made up his mind to receive his sister-in-law, was at first\nunwilling to invite his younger nephew. \"But he is in the Engineers,\"\nsaid Lady Scroope. The argument had its weight, and Jack Neville was\ninvited. But even that argument failed to obliterate the idea which had\ntaken hold of the Earl's mind. There had never yet been a Jack among the\nScroopes.\n\nWhen Jack came he was found to be very unlike the Nevilles in\nappearance. In the first place he was dark, and in the next place he\nwas ugly. He was a tall, well-made fellow, taller than his brother,\nand probably stronger; and he had very different eyes,--very dark\nbrown eyes, deeply set in his head, with large dark eyebrows. He wore\nhis black hair very short, and had no beard whatever. His features\nwere hard, and on one cheek he had a cicatrice, the remains of some\nmisfortune that had happened to him in his boyhood. But in spite of his\nugliness,--for he was ugly, there was much about him in his gait and\nmanner that claimed attention. Lord Scroope, the moment that he saw him,\nfelt that he ought not to be called Jack. Indeed the Earl was almost\nafraid of him, and so after a time was the Countess. \"Jack ought to have\nbeen the eldest,\" Fred had said to his aunt.\n\n\"Why should he have been the eldest?\"\n\n\"Because he is so much the cleverest. I could never have got into the\nEngineers.\"\n\n\"That seems to be a reason why he should be the youngest,\" said Lady\nScroope.\n\nTwo or three other people arrived, and the house became much less\ndull than was its wont. Jack Neville occasionally rode his brother's\nhorses, and the Earl was forced to acknowledge another mistake. The\nmother was very silent, but she was a lady. The young Engineer was not\nonly a gentleman,--but for his age a very well educated gentleman, and\nLord Scroope was almost proud of his relatives. For the first week the\naffair between Fred Neville and Miss Mellerby really seemed to make\nprogress. She was not a girl given to flirting,--not prone to outward\ndemonstrations of partiality for a young man; but she never withdrew\nherself from her intended husband, and Fred seemed quite willing to\nbe attentive. Not a word was said to hurry the young people, and Lady\nScroope's hopes were high. Of course no allusion had been made to those\nhorrid Irish people, but it did not seem to Lady Scroope that the heir\nhad left his heart behind him in Co. Clare.\n\nFred had told his aunt in one of his letters that he would stay three\nweeks at Scroope, but she had not supposed that he would limit himself\nexactly to that period. No absolute limit had been fixed for the visit\nof Mrs. Neville and her younger son, but it was taken for granted that\nthey would not remain should Fred depart. As to Sophie Mellerby, her\nvisit was elastic. She was there for a purpose, and might remain all the\nwinter if the purpose could be so served. For the first fortnight Lady\nScroope thought that the affair was progressing well. Fred hunted three\ndays a week, and was occasionally away from home,--going to dine with\na regiment at Dorchester, and once making a dash up to London; but his\nmanner to Miss Mellerby was very nice, and there could be no doubt but\nthat Sophie liked him. When, on a sudden, the heir said a word to his\naunt which was almost equal to firing a pistol at her head. \"I think\nMaster Jack is making it all square with Sophie Mellerby.\"\n\nIf there was anything that Lady Scroope hated almost as much as improper\nmarriages it was slang. She professed that she did not understand it;\nand in carrying out her profession always stopped the conversation to\nhave any word explained to her which she thought had been used in an\nimproper sense. The idea of a young man making it \"all square\" with a\nyoung woman was repulsive, but the idea of this young man making it \"all\nsquare\" with this young woman was so much more repulsive, and the misery\nto her was so intensely heightened by the unconcern displayed by the\nheir in so speaking of the girl with whom he ought to have been making\nit \"all square\" himself, that she could hardly allow herself to be\narrested by that stumbling block. \"Impossible!\" she exclaimed,--\"that is\nif you mean,--if you mean,--if you mean anything at all.\"\n\n\"I do mean a good deal.\"\n\n\"Then I don't believe a word of it. It's quite out of the question. It's\nimpossible. I'm quite sure your brother understands his position as a\ngentleman too thoroughly to dream of such a thing.\"\n\nThis was Greek to Fred Neville. Why his brother should not fall in love\nwith a pretty girl, and why a pretty girl should not return the feeling,\nwithout any disgrace to his brother, Fred could not understand. His\nbrother was a Neville, and was moreover an uncommonly clever fellow.\n\"Why shouldn't he dream of it?\"\n\n\"In the first place--. Well! I did think, Fred, that you yourself seemed\nto be,--seemed to be taken with Miss Mellerby.\"\n\n\"Who? I? Oh, dear no. She's a very nice girl and all that, and I like\nher amazingly. If she were Jack's wife, I never saw a girl I should so\nmuch like for a sister.\"\n\n\"It is quite out of the question. I wonder that you can speak in such a\nway. What right can your brother have to think of such a girl as Miss\nMellerby? He has no position;--no means.\"\n\n\"He is my brother,\" said Fred, with a little touch of anger,--already\ndiscounting his future earldom on his brother's behalf.\n\n\"Yes;--he is your brother; but you don't suppose that Mr. Mellerby would\ngive his daughter to an officer in the Engineers who has, as far as I\nknow, no private means whatever.\"\n\n\"He will have,--when my mother dies. Of course I can't speak of doing\nanything for anybody at present. I may die before my uncle. Nothing is\nmore likely. But then, if I do, Jack would be my uncle's heir.\"\n\n\"I don't believe there's anything in it at all,\" said Lady Scroope in\ngreat dudgeon.\n\n\"I dare say not. If there is, they haven't told me. It's not likely they\nwould. But I thought I saw something coming up, and as it seemed to be\nthe most natural thing in the world, I mentioned it. As for me,--Miss\nMellerby doesn't care a straw for me. You may be sure of that.\"\n\n\"She would--if you'd ask her.\"\n\n\"But I never shall ask her. What's the use of beating about the bush,\naunt? I never shall ask her; and if I did, she wouldn't have me. If you\nwant to make Sophie Mellerby your niece, Jack's your game.\"\n\nLady Scroope was ineffably disgusted. To be told that \"Jack was her\ngame\" was in itself a terrible annoyance to her. But to be so told in\nreference to such a subject was painful in the extreme. Of course she\ncould not make this young man marry as she wished. She had acknowledged\nto herself from the first that there could be no cause of anger against\nhim should he not fall into the silken net which was spread for him.\nLady Scroope was not an unreasonable woman, and understood well the\npower which young people have over old people. She knew that she\ncouldn't quarrel with Fred Neville, even if she would. He was the heir,\nand in a very few years would be the owner of everything. In order\nto keep him straight, to save him from debts, to protect him from\nmoney-lenders, and to secure the family standing and property till he\nshould have made things stable by having a wife and heir of his own, all\nmanner of indulgence must be shown him. She quite understood that such a\nhorse must be ridden with a very light hand. She must put up with slang\nfrom him, though she would resent it from any other human being. He must\nbe allowed to smoke in his bed-room, to be late at dinner, to shirk\nmorning prayers,--making her only too happy if he would not shirk Sunday\nchurch also. Of course he must choose a bride for himself,--only not a\nRoman Catholic wild Irish bride of whom nobody knew anything!\n\nAs to that other matter concerning Jack and Sophie Mellerby, she could\nnot bring herself to believe it. She had certainly seen that they were\ngood friends,--as would have been quite fit had Fred been engaged to\nher; but she had not conceived the possibility of any mistake on such a\nsubject. Surely Sophie herself knew better what she was about! How would\nshe,--she, Lady Scroope,--answer it to Lady Sophia, if Sophie should go\nback to Mellerby from her house, engaged to a younger brother who had\nnothing but a commission in the Engineers? Sophie had been sent to\nScroope on purpose to be fallen in love with by the heir; and how\nwould it be with Lady Scroope if, in lieu of this, she should not only\nhave been fallen in love with by the heir's younger brother, but have\nresponded favourably to so base an affection?\n\nThat same afternoon Fred told his uncle that he was going back to\nIreland on the day but one following, thus curtailing his promised three\nweeks by two days. \"I am sorry that you are so much hurried, Fred,\" said\nthe old man.\n\n\"So am I, my lord,--but Johnstone has to go to London on business, and I\npromised when I got leave that I wouldn't throw him over. You see,--when\none has a profession one must attend to it,--more or less.\"\n\n\"But you hardly need the profession.\"\n\n\"Thank you, uncle;--it is very kind of you to say so. And as you wish me\nto leave it, I will when the year is over. I have told the fellows that\nI shall stay till next October, and I shouldn't like to change now.\" The\nEarl hadn't another word to say.\n\nBut on the day before Fred's departure there came a short note from Lady\nMary Quin which made poor Lady Scroope more unhappy than ever. Tidings\nhad reached her in a mysterious way that the O'Haras were eagerly\nexpecting the return of Mr. Neville. Lady Mary thought that if Mr.\nNeville's quarters could be moved from Ennis, it would be very expedient\nfor many reasons. She knew that enquiries had been made for him and that\nhe was engaged to dine on a certain day with Father Marty the priest.\nFather Marty would no doubt go any lengths to serve his friends the\nO'Haras. Then Lady Mary was very anxious that not a word should be said\nto Mr. Neville which might lead him to suppose that reports respecting\nhim were being sent from Quin Castle to Scroope.\n\nThe Countess in her agony thought it best to tell the whole story to the\nEarl. \"But what can I do?\" said the old man. \"Young men will form these\nacquaintances.\" His fears were evidently as yet less dark than those of\nhis wife.\n\n\"It would be very bad if we were to hear that he was married to a girl\nof whom we only know that she is a Roman Catholic and friendless.\"\n\nThe Earl's brow became very black. \"I don't think that he would treat me\nin that way.\"\n\n\"Not meaning it, perhaps;--but if he should become entangled and make a\npromise!\"\n\nThen the Earl did speak to his nephew. \"Fred,\" he said, \"I have been\nthinking a great deal about you. I have little else to think of now. I\nshould take it as a mark of affection from you if you would give up the\narmy--at once.\"\n\n\"And not join my regiment again at all?\"\n\n\"It is absurd that you should do so in your present position. You should\nbe here, and learn the circumstances of the property before it becomes\nyour own. There can hardly be more than a year or two left for the\nlesson.\"\n\nThe Earl's manner was very impressive. He looked into his nephew's face\nas he spoke, and stood with his hand upon the young man's shoulder.\nBut Fred Neville was a Neville all over,--and the Nevilles had always\nchosen to have their own way. He had not the power of intellect nor\nthe finished manliness which his brother possessed; but he could be as\nobstinate as any Neville,--as obstinate as his father had been, or his\nuncle. And in this matter he had arguments which his uncle could hardly\nanswer on the spur of the moment. No doubt he could sell out in proper\ncourse, but at the present moment he was as much bound by military\nlaw to return as would be any common soldier at the expiration of his\nfurlough. He must go back. That at any rate was certain. And if his\nuncle did not much mind it, he would prefer to remain with his regiment\ntill October.\n\nLord Scroope could not condescend to repeat his request, or even again\nto allude to it. His whole manner altered as he took his hand away from\nhis nephew's shoulder. But still he was determined that there should\nbe no quarrel. As yet there was no ground for quarrelling,--and by any\nquarrel the injury to him would be much greater than any that could\nbefall the heir. He stood for a moment and then he spoke again in a tone\nvery different from that he had used before. \"I hope,\" he said,--and\nthen he paused again; \"I hope you know how very much depends on your\nmarrying in a manner suitable to your position.\"\n\n\"Quite so;--I think.\"\n\n\"It is the one hope left to me to see you properly settled in life.\"\n\n\"Marriage is a very serious thing, uncle. Suppose I were not to marry at\nall! Sometimes I think my brother is much more like marrying than I am.\"\n\n\"You are bound to marry,\" said the Earl solemnly. \"And you are specially\nbound by every duty to God and man to make no marriage that will be\ndisgraceful to the position which you are called upon to fill.\"\n\n\"At any rate I will not do that,\" said Fred Neville proudly. From this\nthe Earl took some comfort, and then the interview was over.\n\nOn the day appointed by himself Fred left the Manor, and his mother\nand brother went on the following day. But after he was gone, on that\nsame afternoon, Jack Neville asked Sophie Mellerby to be his wife. She\nrefused him,--with all the courtesy she knew how to use, but also with\nall the certainty. And as soon as he had left the house she told Lady\nScroope what had happened.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nARDKILL COTTAGE.\n\n\nThe cliffs of Moher in Co. Clare, on the western coast of Ireland, are\nnot as well known to tourists as they should be. It may be doubted\nwhether Lady Mary Quin was right when she called them the highest cliffs\nin the world, but they are undoubtedly very respectable cliffs, and run\nup some six hundred feet from the sea as nearly perpendicular as cliffs\nshould be. They are beautifully coloured, streaked with yellow veins,\nand with great masses of dark red rock; and beneath them lies the broad\nand blue Atlantic. Lady Mary's exaggeration as to the comparative\nheight is here acknowledged, but had she said that below them rolls\nthe brightest bluest clearest water in the world she would not have\nbeen far wrong. To the south of these cliffs there runs inland a broad\nbay,--Liscannor bay, on the sides of which are two little villages,\nLiscannor and Lahinch. At the latter, Fred Neville, since he had been\nquartered at Ennis, had kept a boat for the sake of shooting seals\nand exploring the coast,--and generally carrying out his spirit of\nadventure. Not far from Liscannor was Castle Quin, the seat of the Earl\nof Kilfenora; and some way up from Liscannor towards the cliffs, about\ntwo miles from the village, there is a cottage called Ardkill. Here\nlived Mrs. and Miss O'Hara.\n\nIt was the nearest house to the rocks, from which it was distant less\nthan half a mile. The cottage, so called, was a low rambling long house,\nbut one storey high,--very unlike an English cottage. It stood in two\nnarrow lengths, the one running at right angles to the other; and\ncontained a large kitchen, two sitting rooms,--of which one was never\nused,--and four or five bed-rooms of which only three were furnished.\nThe servant girl occupied one, and the two ladies the others. It was a\nblank place enough,--and most unlike that sort of cottage which English\nladies are supposed to inhabit, when they take to cottage life. There\nwas no garden to it, beyond a small patch in which a few potatoes were\nplanted. It was so near to the ocean, so exposed to winds from the\nAtlantic, that no shrubs would live there. Everything round it, even the\nherbage, was impregnated with salt, and told tales of the neighbouring\nwaves. When the wind was from the west the air would be so laden with\nspray that one could not walk there without being wet. And yet the place\nwas very healthy, and noted for the fineness of its air. Rising from the\ncottage, which itself stood high, was a steep hill running up to the top\nof the cliff, covered with that peculiar moss which the salt spray of\nthe ocean produces. On this side the land was altogether open, but a\nfew sheep were always grazing there when the wind was not so high as to\ndrive them to some shelter. Behind the cottage there was an enclosed\npaddock which belonged to it, and in which Mrs. O'Hara kept her cow.\nRoaming free around the house, and sometimes in it, were a dozen hens\nand a noisy old cock which, with the cow, made up the total of the\nwidow's live stock. About a half a mile from the cottage on the way\nto Liscannor there were half a dozen mud cabins which contained Mrs.\nO'Hara's nearest neighbours,--and an old burying ground. Half a mile\nfurther on again was the priest's house, and then on to Liscannor there\nwere a few other straggling cabins here and there along the road.\n\nUp to the cottage indeed there could hardly be said to be more than a\ntrack, and beyond the cottage no more than a sheep path. The road coming\nout from Liscannor was a real road as far as the burying ground, but\nfrom thence onward it had degenerated. A car, or carriage if needed,\nmight be brought up to the cottage door, for the ground was hard and the\nway was open. But no wheels ever travelled there now. The priest, when\nhe would come, came on horseback, and there was a shed in which he could\ntie up his nag. He himself from time to time would send up a truss of\nhay for his nag's use, and would think himself cruelly used because the\ncow would find her way in and eat it. No other horse ever called at the\nwidow's door. What slender stores were needed for her use, were all\nbrought on the girls' backs from Liscannor. To the north of the cottage,\nalong the cliff, there was no road for miles, nor was there house or\nhabitation. Castle Quin, in which the noble but somewhat impoverished\nQuin family lived nearly throughout the year, was distant, inland, about\nthree miles from the cottage. Lady Mary had said in her letter to her\nfriend that Mrs. O'Hara was a lady;--and as Mrs. O'Hara had no other\nneighbour, ranking with herself in that respect, so near her, and none\nother but the Protestant clergyman's wife within six miles of her,\ncharity, one would have thought, might have induced some of the Quin\nfamily to notice her. But the Quins were Protestant, and Mrs. O'Hara was\nnot only a Roman Catholic, but a Roman Catholic who had been brought\ninto the parish by the priest. No evil certainly was known of her, but\nthen nothing was known of her; and the Quins were a very cautious people\nwhere religion was called in question. In the days of the famine Father\nMarty and the Earl and the Protestant vicar had worked together in the\ngood cause;--but those days were now gone by, and the strange intimacy\nhad soon died away. The Earl when he met the priest would bow to him,\nand the two clergymen would bow to each other;--but beyond such dumb\nsalutation there was no intercourse between them. It had been held\ntherefore to be impossible to take any notice of the priest's friends.\n\nAnd what notice could have been taken of two ladies who came from nobody\nknew where, to live in that wild out-of-the-way place, nobody knew why?\nThey called themselves mother and daughter, and they called themselves\nO'Haras;--but there was no evidence of the truth even of these\nassertions. They were left therefore in their solitude, and never saw\nthe face of a friend across their door step except that of Father Marty.\n\nIn truth Mrs. O'Hara's life had been of a nature almost to necessitate\nsuch solitude. With her story we have nothing to do here. For our\npurpose there is no need that her tale should be told. Suffice it to say\nthat she had been deserted by her husband, and did not now know whether\nshe was or was not a widow. This was in truth the only mystery attached\nto her. She herself was an Englishwoman, though a Catholic; but she had\nbeen left early an orphan, and had been brought up in a provincial town\nof France by her grandmother. There she had married a certain Captain\nO'Hara, she having some small means of her own sufficient to make her\nvaluable in the eyes of an adventurer. At that time she was no more\nthan eighteen, and had given her hand to the Captain in opposition to\nthe wishes of her only guardian. What had been her life from that time\nto the period at which, under Father Marty's auspices, she became the\ninhabitant of Ardkill Cottage, no one knew but herself. She was then\nutterly dissevered from all friends and relatives, and appeared on the\nwestern coast of County Clare with her daughter, a perfect stranger to\nevery one. Father Marty was an old man, now nearly seventy, and had been\neducated in France. There he had known Mrs. O'Hara's grandmother, and\nhence had arisen the friendship which had induced him to bring the lady\ninto his parish. She came there with a daughter, then hardly more than a\nchild. Between two and three years had passed since her coming, and the\nchild was now a grown-up girl, nearly nineteen years old. Of her means\nlittle or nothing was known accurately, even to the priest. She had told\nhim that she had saved enough out of the wreck on which to live with her\ngirl after some very humble fashion, and she paid her way. There must\nhave come some sudden crash, or she would hardly have taken her child\nfrom an expensive Parisian school to vegetate in such solitude as that\nshe had chosen. And it was a solitude from which there seemed to be no\nchance of future escape. They had brought with them a piano and a few\nbooks, mostly French;--and with these it seemed to have been intended\nthat the two ladies should make their future lives endurable. Other\nresources except such as the scenery of the cliffs afforded them, they\nhad none.\n\nThe author would wish to impress upon his readers, if it may be\npossible, some idea of the outward appearance and personal character of\neach of these two ladies, as his story can hardly be told successfully\nunless he do so. The elder, who was at this time still under forty\nyears of age, would have been a very handsome woman had not troubles,\nsuffering, and the contests of a rugged life, in which she had both\nendured and dared much, given to her face a look of hard combative\nresolution which was not feminine. She was rather below than above the\naverage height,--or at any rate looked to be so, as she was strongly\nmade, with broad shoulders, and a waist that was perhaps not now as\nslender as when she first met Captain O'Hara. But her hair was still\nblack,--as dark at least as hair can be which is not in truth black at\nall but only darkly brown. Whatever might be its colour there was no\ntinge of grey upon it. It was glossy, silken, and long as when she was a\ngirl. I do not think that she took pride in it. How could she take pride\nin personal beauty, when she was never seen by any man younger than\nFather Marty or the old peasant who brought turf to her door in creels\non a donkey's back? But she wore it always without any cap, tied in a\nsimple knot behind her head. Whether chignons had been invented then the\nauthor does not remember,--but they certainly had not become common on\nthe coast of County Clare, and the peasants about Liscannor thought Mrs.\nO'Hara's head of hair the finest they had ever seen. Had the ladies Quin\nof the Castle possessed such hair as that, they would not have been\nthe ladies Quin to this day. Her eyes were lustrous, dark, and very\nlarge,--beautiful eyes certainly; but they were eyes that you might\nfear. They had been softer perhaps in youth, before the spirit of the\ntiger had been roused in the woman's bosom by neglect and ill-usage. Her\nface was now bronzed by years and weather. Of her complexion she took no\nmore care than did the neighbouring fishermen of theirs, and the winds\nand the salt water, and perhaps the working of her own mind, had told\nupon it, to make it rough and dark. But yet there was a colour in her\ncheeks, as we often see in those of wandering gipsies, which would make\na man stop to regard her who had eyes appreciative of beauty. Her nose\nwas well formed,--a heaven-made nose, and not a lump of flesh stuck on\nto the middle of her face as women's noses sometimes are;--but it was\nsomewhat short and broad at the nostrils, a nose that could imply much\nanger, and perhaps tenderness also. Her face below her nose was very\nshort. Her mouth was large, but laden with expression. Her lips were\nfull and her teeth perfect as pearls. Her chin was short and perhaps now\nverging to that size which we call a double chin, and marked by as broad\na dimple as ever Venus made with her finger on the face of a woman.\n\nShe had ever been strong and active, and years in that retreat had told\nupon her not at all. She would still walk to Liscannor, and thence\nround, when the tide was low, beneath the cliffs, and up by a path which\nthe boys had made from the foot through the rocks to the summit, though\nthe distance was over ten miles, and the ascent was very steep. She\nwould remain for hours on the rocks, looking down upon the sea, when\nthe weather was almost at its roughest. When the winds were still, and\nthe sun was setting across the ocean, and the tame waves were only just\naudible as they rippled on the stones below, she would sit there with\nher child, holding the girl's hand or just touching her arm, and would\nbe content so to stay almost without a word; but when the winds blew,\nand the heavy spray came up in blinding volumes, and the white-headed\nsea-monsters were roaring in their fury against the rocks, she would be\nthere alone with her hat in her hand, and her hair drenched. She would\nwatch the gulls wheeling and floating beneath her, and would listen to\ntheir screams and try to read their voices. She would envy the birds as\nthey seemed to be worked into madness by the winds which still were not\nstrong enough to drive them from their purposes. To linger there among\nthe rocks seemed to be the only delight left to her in life,--except\nthat intense delight which a mother has in loving her child. She herself\nread but little, and never put a hand upon the piano. But she had a\nfaculty of sitting and thinking, of brooding over her own past years and\ndreaming of her daughter's future life, which never deserted her. With\nher the days were doubtless very sad, but it cannot truly be said that\nthey were dull or tedious.\n\nAnd there was a sparkle of humour about her too, which would sometimes\nshine the brightest when there was no one by her to appreciate it. Her\ndaughter would smile at her mother's sallies,--but she did so simply\nin kindness. Kate did not share her mother's sense of humour,--did not\nshare it as yet. With the young the love of fun is gratified generally\nby grotesque movement. It is not till years are running on that the\ngrotesqueness of words and ideas is appreciated. But Mrs. O'Hara would\nexpend her art on the household drudge, or on old Barney Corcoran who\ncame with the turf,--though by neither of them was she very clearly\nunderstood. Now and again she would have a war of words with the\npriest, and that, I think, she liked. She was intensely combative, if\nground for a combat arose; and would fight on any subject with any\nhuman being--except her daughter. And yet with the priest she never\nquarrelled; and though she was rarely beaten in her contests with him,\nshe submitted to him in much. In matters touching her religion she\nsubmitted to him altogether.\n\nKate O'Hara was in face very like her mother;--strangely like, for in\nmuch she was very different. But she had her mother's eyes,--though hers\nwere much softer in their lustre, as became her youth,--and she had her\nmother's nose, but without that look of scorn which would come upon her\nmother's face when the nostrils were inflated. And in that peculiar\nshortness of the lower face she was the very echo of her mother. But the\nmouth was smaller, the lips less full, and the dimple less exaggerated.\nIt was a fairer face to look upon,--fairer, perhaps, than her mother's\nhad ever been; but it was less expressive, and in it there was\ninfinitely less capability for anger, and perhaps less capability for\nthe agonising extremes of tenderness. But Kate was taller than her\nmother, and seemed by her mother's side to be slender. Nevertheless she\nwas strong and healthy; and though she did not willingly join in those\nlonger walks, or expose herself to the weather as did her mother, there\nwas nothing feeble about her, nor was she averse to action. Life at\nArdkill Cottage was dull, and therefore she also was dull. Had she been\nsurrounded by friends, such as she had known in her halcyon school days\nat Paris, she would have been the gayest of the gay.\n\nHer hair was dark as her mother's,--even darker. Seen by the side of\nMiss O'Hara's, the mother's hair was certainly not black, but one could\nhardly think that hair could be blacker than the daughter's. But hers\nfell in curling clusters round her neck,--such clusters as now one never\nsees. She would shake them in sport, and the room would seem to be full\nof her locks. But she used to say herself to her mother that there was\nalready to be found a grey hair among them now and again, and she would\nat times shew one, declaring that she would be an old woman before her\nmother was middle-aged.\n\nHer life at Ardkill Cottage was certainly very dull. Memory did but\nlittle for her, and she hardly knew how to hope. She would read, till\nshe had nearly learned all their books by heart, and would play such\ntunes as she knew by the hour together, till the poor instrument,\nsubject to the sea air and away from any tuner's skill, was discordant\nwith its limp strings. But still, with all this, her mind would become\nvacant and weary. \"Mother,\" she would say, \"is it always to be like\nthis?\"\n\n\"Not always, Kate,\" the mother once answered.\n\n\"And when will it be changed?\"\n\n\"In a few days,--in a few hours, Kate.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, mother?\"\n\n\"That eternity is coming, with all its glory and happiness. If it were\nnot so, it would, indeed, be very bad.\"\n\nIt may be doubted whether any human mind has been able to content itself\nwith hopes of eternity, till distress in some shape has embittered life.\nThe preachers preach very well,--well enough to leave many convictions\non the minds of men; but not well enough to leave that conviction. And\ngodly men live well,--but we never see them living as though such were\ntheir conviction. And were it so, who would strive and moil in this\nworld? When the heart has been broken, and the spirit ground to the\ndust by misery, then,--such is God's mercy--eternity suffices to make\nlife bearable. When Mrs. O'Hara spoke to her daughter of eternity,\nthere was but cold comfort in the word. The girl wanted something\nhere,--pleasures, companions, work, perhaps a lover. This had happened\nbefore Lieutenant Neville of the 20th Hussars had been seen in those\nparts.\n\nAnd the mother herself, in speaking as she had spoken, had, perhaps\nunintentionally, indulged in a sarcasm on life which the daughter\ncertainly had not been intended to understand. \"Yes;--it will always be\nlike this for you, for you, unfortunate one that you are. There is no\nother further look-out in this life. You are one of the wretched to whom\nthe world offers nothing; and therefore,--as, being human, you must\nhope,--build your hopes on eternity.\" Had the words been read clearly,\nthat would have been their true meaning. What could she do for her\nchild? Bread and meat, with a roof over her head, and raiment which\nsufficed for life such as theirs, she could supply. The life would have\nbeen well enough had it been their fate, and within their power, to earn\nthe bread and meat, the shelter and the raiment. But to have it, and\nwithout work,--to have that, and nothing more, in absolute idleness, was\nsuch misery that there was no resource left but eternity!\n\nAnd yet the mother when she looked at her daughter almost persuaded\nherself that it need not be so. The girl was very lovely,--so lovely\nthat, were she but seen, men would quarrel for her as to who should have\nher in his keeping. Such beauty, such life, such capability for giving\nand receiving enjoyment could not have been intended to wither on a lone\ncliff over the Atlantic! There must be fault somewhere. But yet to live\nhad been the first necessity; and life in cities, among the haunts of\nmen, had been impossible with such means as this woman possessed. When\nshe had called her daughter to her, and had sought peace under the roof\nwhich her friend the priest had found for her, peace and a roof to\nshelter her had been the extent of her desires. To be at rest, and\nindependent, with her child within her arms, had been all that the woman\nasked of the gods. For herself it sufficed. For herself she was able to\nacknowledge that the rest which she had at least obtained was infinitely\npreferable to the unrest of her past life. But she soon learned,--as she\nhad not expected to learn before she made the experiment,--that that\nwhich was to her peace, was to her daughter life within a tomb. \"Mother,\nis it always to be like this?\"\n\nHad her child not carried the weight of good blood, had some small\ngrocer or country farmer been her father, she might have come down to\nthe neighbouring town of Ennistimon, and found a fitting mate there.\nWould it not have been better so? From that weight of good blood,--or\ngift, if it please us to call it,--what advantage would ever come to her\ngirl? It can not really be that all those who swarm in the world below\nthe bar of gentlehood are less blessed, or intended to be less blessed,\nthan the few who float in the higher air. As to real blessedness, does\nit not come from fitness to the outer life and a sense of duty that\nshall produce such fitness? Does any one believe that the Countess has a\ngreater share of happiness than the grocer's wife, or is less subject to\nthe miseries which flesh inherits? But such matters cannot be changed\nby the will. This woman could not bid her daughter go and meet the\nbutcher's son on equal terms, or seek her friends among the milliners of\nthe neighbouring town. The burden had been imposed and must be borne,\neven though it isolated them from all the world.\n\n\"Mother, is it always to be like this?\" Of course the mother knew what\nwas needed. It was needed that the girl should go out into the world and\npair, that she should find some shoulder on which she might lean, some\narm that would be strong to surround her, the heart of some man and the\nwork of some man to which she might devote herself. The girl, when she\nasked her question, did not know this,--but the mother knew it. The\nmother looked at her child and said that of all living creatures her\nchild was surely the loveliest. Was it not fit that she should go forth\nand be loved;--that she should at any rate go forth and take her chance\nwith others? But how should such going forth be managed? And then,--were\nthere not dangers, terrible dangers,--dangers specially terrible to one\nso friendless as her child? Had not she herself been wrecked among the\nrocks, trusting herself to one who had been utterly unworthy,--loving\none who had been utterly unlovely? Men so often are as ravenous wolves,\nmerciless, rapacious, without hearts, full of greed, full of lust,\nlooking on female beauty as prey, regarding the love of woman and her\nvery life as a toy! Were she higher in the world there might be safety.\nWere she lower there might be safety. But how could she send her girl\nforth into the world without sending her certainly among the wolves? And\nyet that piteous question was always sounding in her ears. \"Mother, is\nit always to be like this?\"\n\nThen Lieutenant Neville had appeared upon the scene, dressed in a\nsailor's jacket and trowsers, with a sailor's cap upon his head, with\na loose handkerchief round his neck and his hair blowing to the wind.\nIn the eyes of Kate O'Hara he was an Apollo. In the eyes of any girl he\nmust have seemed to be as good-looking a fellow as ever tied a sailor's\nknot. He had made acquaintance with Father Marty at Liscannor, and the\npriest had dined with him at Ennis. There had been a return visit, and\nthe priest, perhaps innocently, had taken him up on the cliffs. There he\nhad met the two ladies, and our hero had been introduced to Kate O'Hara.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nI'LL GO BAIL SHE LIKES IT.\n\n\nIt might be that the young man was a ravenous wolf, but his manners were\nnot wolfish. Had Mrs. O'Hara been a princess, supreme in her own rights,\nyoung Neville could not have treated her or her daughter with more\nrespect. At first Kate had wondered at him, but had said but little. She\nhad listened to him, as he talked to her mother and the priest about the\ncliffs and the birds and the seals he had shot, and she had felt that\nit was this, something like this, that was needed to make life so sweet\nthat as yet there need be no longing, no thought, for eternity. It was\nnot that all at once she loved him, but she felt that he was a thing to\nlove. His very appearance on the cliff, and the power of thinking of him\nwhen he was gone, for a while banished all tedium from her life. \"Why\nshould you shoot the poor gulls?\" That was the first question she asked\nhim; and she asked it hardly in tenderness to the birds, but because\nwith the unconscious cunning of her sex she understood that tenderness\nin a woman is a charm in the eyes of a man.\n\n\"Only because it is so difficult to get at them,\" said Fred. \"I believe\nthere is no other reason,--except that one must shoot something.\"\n\n\"But why must you?\" asked Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\"To justify one's guns. A man takes to shooting as a matter of course.\nIt's a kind of institution. There ain't any tigers, and so we shoot\nbirds. And in this part of the world there ain't any pheasants, and so\nwe shoot sea-gulls.\"\n\n\"Excellently argued,\" said the priest.\n\n\"Or rather one don't, for it's impossible to get at them. But I'll tell\nyou what, Father Marty,\"--Neville had already assumed the fashion of\ncalling the priest by his familiar priestly name, as strangers do much\nmore readily than they who belong to the country,--\"I'll tell you what,\nFather Marty,--I've shot one of the finest seals I ever saw, and if\nMorony can get him at low water, I'll send the skin up to Mrs. O'Hara.\"\n\n\"And send the oil to me,\" said the priest. \"There's some use in shooting\na seal. But you can do nothing with those birds,--unless you get enough\nof their feathers to make a bed.\"\n\nThis was in October, and before the end of November Fred Neville was,\nafter a fashion, intimate at the cottage. He had never broken bread at\nMrs. O'Hara's table; nor, to tell the truth, had any outspoken, clearly\nintelligible word of love been uttered by him to the girl. But he had\nbeen seen with them often enough, and the story had become sufficiently\ncurrent at Liscannor to make Lady Mary Quin think that she was justified\nin sending her bad news to her friend Lady Scroope. This she did not do\ntill Fred had been induced, with some difficulty, to pass a night at\nCastle Quin. Lady Mary had not scrupled to ask a question about Miss\nO'Hara, and had thought the answer very unsatisfactory. \"I don't know\nwhat makes them live there, I'm sure. I should have thought you would\nhave known that,\" replied Neville, in answer to her question.\n\n\"They are perfect mysteries to us,\" said Lady Mary.\n\n\"I think that Miss O'Hara is the prettiest girl I ever saw in my life,\"\nsaid Fred boldly, \"and I should say the handsomest woman, if it were not\nthat there may be a question between her and her mother.\"\n\n\"You are enthusiastic,\" said Lady Mary Quin, and after that the letter\nto Scroope was written.\n\nIn the meantime the seal-skin was cured,--not perhaps in the very best\nfashion, and was sent up to Miss O'Hara, with Mr. Neville's compliments.\nThe skin of a seal that has been shot by the man and not purchased is a\npresent that any lady may receive from any gentleman. The most prudent\nmamma that ever watched over her dovecote with Argus eyes, permitting no\ntouch of gallantry to come near it, could hardly insist that a seal-skin\nin the rough should be sent back to the donor. Mrs. O'Hara was by no\nmeans that most prudent mamma, and made, not only the seal-skin, but the\ndonor also welcome. Must it not be that by some chance advent such as\nthis that the change must be effected in her girl's life, should any\nchange ever be made? And her girl was good. Why should she fear for her?\nThe man had been brought there by her only friend, the priest, and why\nshould she fear him? And yet she did fear; and though her face was\nnever clouded when her girl spoke of the new comer, though she always\nmentioned Captain Neville's name as though she herself liked the man,\nthough she even was gracious to him when he shewed himself near the\ncottage,--still there was a deep dread upon her when her eyes rested\nupon him, when her thoughts flew to him. Men are wolves to women, and\nutterly merciless when feeding high their lust. 'Twas thus her own\nthoughts shaped themselves, though she never uttered a syllable to her\ndaughter in disparagement of the man. This was the girl's chance. Was\nshe to rob her of it? And yet, of all her duties, was not the duty of\nprotecting her girl the highest and the dearest that she owned? If the\nman meant well by her girl, she would wash his feet with her hair, kiss\nthe hem of his garments, and love the spot on which she had first seen\nhim stand like a young sea-god. But if evil,--if he meant evil to her\ngirl, if he should do evil to her Kate,--then she knew that there was\nso much of the tiger within her bosom as would serve to rend him limb\nfrom limb. With such thoughts as these she had hardly ever left them\ntogether. Nor had such leaving together seemed to be desired by them.\nAs for Kate she certainly would have shunned it. She thought of Fred\nNeville during all her waking moments, and dreamed of him at night. His\ncoming had certainly been to her as the coming of a god. Though he did\nnot appear on the cliffs above once or twice a week, and had done so but\nfor a few weeks, his presence had altered the whole tenour of her life.\nShe never asked her mother now whether it was to be always like this.\nThere was a freshness about her life which her mother understood at\nonce. She was full of play, reading less than was her wont, but still\nwith no sense of tedium. Of the man in his absence she spoke but seldom,\nand when his name was on her lips she would jest with it,--as though the\ncoming of a young embryo lord to shoot gulls on their coast was quite a\njoke. The seal-skin which he had given her was very dear to her, and she\nwas at no pains to hide her liking; but of the man as a lover she had\nnever seemed to think.\n\nNor did she think of him as a lover. It is not by such thinking that\nlove grows. Nor did she ever tell herself that while he was there,\ncoming on one day and telling them that his boat would be again there on\nanother, life was blessed to her, and that, therefore, when he should\nhave left them, her life would be accursed to her. She knew nothing of\nall this. But yet she thought of him, and dreamed of him, and her young\nhead was full of little plans with every one of which he was connected.\n\nAnd it may almost be said that Fred Neville was as innocent in the\nmatter as was the girl. It is true, indeed, that men are merciless as\nwolves to women,--that they become so, taught by circumstances and\ntrained by years; but the young man who begins by meaning to be a wolf\nmust be bad indeed. Fred Neville had no such meaning. On his behalf it\nmust be acknowledged that he had no meaning whatever when he came again\nand again to Ardkill. Had he examined himself in the matter he would\nhave declared that he liked the mother quite as well as the daughter.\nWhen Lady Mary Quin had thrown at him her very blunt arrow he had\ndefended himself on that plea. Accident, and the spirit of adventure,\nhad thrust these ladies in his path, and no doubt he liked them the\nbetter because they did not live as other people lived. Their solitude,\nthe close vicinity of the ocean, the feeling that in meeting them none\nof the ordinary conventional usages of society were needed, the wildness\nand the strangeness of the scene, all had charms which he admitted to\nhimself. And he knew that the girl was very lovely. Of course he said\nso to himself and to others. To take delight in beauty is assumed to be\nthe nature of a young man, and this young man was not one to wish to\ndiffer from others in that respect. But when he went back to spend his\nChristmas at Scroope, he had never told even himself that he intended to\nbe her lover.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mrs. O'Hara,\" he said, a day or two before he left Ennis.\n\n\"So you're going?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I'm off. The orders from home are imperative. One has to cut\none's lump of Christmas beef and also one's lump of Christmas pudding.\nIt is our family religion, you know.\"\n\n\"What a happiness to have a family to visit!\"\n\n\"It's all very well, I suppose. I don't grumble. Only it's a bore going\naway, somehow.\"\n\n\"You are coming back to Ennis?\" asked Kate.\n\n\"Coming back;--I should think so. Barney Morony wouldn't be quite\nso quiet if I was not coming back. I'm to dine with Father Marty at\nLiscannor on the 15th of January, to meet another priest from Milltown\nMalbay,--the best fellow in the world he says.\"\n\n\"That's Father Creech;--not half such a good fellow, Mr. Neville, as\nFather Marty himself.\"\n\n\"He couldn't be better. However, I shall be here then, and if I have any\nluck you shall have another skin of the same size by that time.\" Then he\nshook hands with them both, and there was a feeling that the time would\nbe blank till he should be again there in his sailor's jacket.\n\nWhen the second week in January had come Mrs. O'Hara heard that the\ngallant young officer of the 20th was back in Ennis, and she well\nremembered that he had told her of his intention to dine with the\npriest. On the Sunday she saw Mr. Marty after mass, and managed to have\na few words with him on the road while Kate returned to the cottage\nalone. \"So your friend Mr. Neville has come back to Ennis,\" she said.\n\n\"I didn't know that he had come. He promised to dine with me on\nThursday,--only I think nothing of promises from these young fellows.\"\n\n\"He told me he was to be with you.\"\n\n\"More power to him. He'll be welcome. I'm getting to be a very ould man,\nMisthress O'Hara; but I'm not so ould but I like to have the young ones\nnear me.\"\n\n\"It is pleasant to see a bright face like his.\"\n\n\"That's thrue for you, Misthress O'Hara. I like to see 'em bright and\nganial. I don't know that I ever shot so much as a sparrow, meself, but\nI love to hear them talk of their shootings, and huntings, and the like\nof that. I've taken a fancy to that boy, and he might do pretty much as\nhe plazes wid me.\"\n\n\"And I too have taken a fancy to him, Father Marty.\"\n\n\"Shure and how could you help it?\"\n\n\"But he mustn't do as he pleases with me.\" Father Marty looked up into\nher face as though he did not understand her. \"If I were alone, as you\nare, I could afford, like you, to indulge in the pleasure of a bright\nface. Only in that case he would not care to let me see it.\"\n\n\"Bedad thin, Misthress O'Hara, I don't know a fairer face to look on in\nall Corcomroe than your own,--that is when you're not in your tantrums,\nMisthress O'Hara.\" The priest was a privileged person, and could say\nwhat he liked to his friend; and she understood that a priest might say\nwithout fault what would be very faulty if it came from any one else.\n\n\"I'm in earnest now, Father Marty. What shall we do if our darling Kate\nthinks of this young man more than is good for her?\" Father Marty raised\nhis hat and began to scratch his head. \"If you like to look at the fair\nface of a handsome lad--\"\n\n\"I do thin, Misthress O'Hara.\"\n\n\"Must not she like it also?\"\n\n\"I'll go bail she likes it,\" said the priest.\n\n\"And what will come next?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is, Misthress O'Hara. Would you want to keep her\nfrom even seeing a man at all?\"\n\n\"God forbid.\"\n\n\"It's not the way to make them happy, nor yet safe. If it's to be\nthat way wid her, she'd better be a nun all out; and I'd be far from\nproposing that to your Kate.\"\n\n\"She is hardly fit for so holy a life.\"\n\n\"And why should she? I niver like seeing too many of 'em going that way,\nand them that are prittiest are the last I'd send there. But if not\na nun, it stands to reason she must take chance with the rest of 'em.\nShe's been too much shut up already. Let her keep her heart till he asks\nher for it; but if he does ask her, why shouldn't she be his wife? How\nmany of them young officers take Irish wives home with 'em every year.\nOnly for them, our beauties wouldn't have a chance.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nFATHER MARTY'S HOSPITALITY.\n\n\nSuch was the philosophy, or, perhaps, it may be better said such was the\nhumanity of Father Marty! But in encouraging Mrs. O'Hara to receive this\ndangerous visitor he had by no means spoken without consideration. In\none respect we must abandon Father Marty to the judgment and censure\nof fathers and mothers. The whole matter looked at from Lady Scroope's\npoint of view was no doubt very injurious to the priest's character. He\nregarded a stranger among them, such as was Fred Neville, as fair spoil,\nas a Philistine to seize whom and capture him for life on behalf of any\nIrish girl would be a great triumph;--a spoiling of the Egyptian to\nthe accomplishment of which he would not hesitate to lend his priestly\nassistance, the end to be accomplished, of course, being marriage. For\nLord Scroope and his family and his blood and his religious fanaticism\nhe could entertain no compassion whatever. Father Marty was no great\npolitician, and desired no rebellion against England. Even in the days\nof O'Connell and repeal he had been but luke-warm. But justice for\nIreland in the guise of wealthy English husbands for pretty Irish\ngirls he desired with all his heart. He was true to his own faith, to\nthe backbone, but he entertained no prejudice against a good looking\nProtestant youth when a fortunate marriage was in question. So little\nhad been given to the Irish in these days, that they were bound to take\nwhat they could get. Lord Scroope and the Countess, had they known\nthe priest's views on this matter, would have regarded him as an\nunscrupulous intriguing ruffian, prepared to destroy the happiness of a\nnoble family by a wicked scheme. But his views of life, as judged from\nthe other side, admitted of some excuse. As for a girl breaking her\nheart, he did not, perhaps, much believe in such a catastrophe. Of a\nsore heart a girl must run the chance,--as also must a man. That young\nmen do go about promising marriage and not keeping their promise, he\nknew well. None could know that better than he did, for he was the\nrepository of half the love secrets in his parish. But all that was\npart of the evil coming from the fall of Adam, and must be endured\ntill,--till the Pope should have his own again, and be able to set all\nthings right. In the meantime young women must do the best they could\nto keep their lovers;--and should one lover break away, then must the\ndeserted one use her experience towards getting a second. But how was a\ngirl to have a lover at all, if she were never allowed to see a man? He\nhad been bred a priest from his youth upwards, and knew nothing of love;\nbut nevertheless it was a pain to him to see a young girl, good-looking,\nhealthy, fit to be the mother of children, pine away, unsought for,\nuncoupled,--as it would be a pain to see a fruit grow ripe upon the\ntree, and then fall and perish for the want of plucking. His philosophy\nwas perhaps at fault, and it may be that his humanity was unrefined. But\nhe was human to the core,--and, at any rate, unselfish. That there might\nbe another danger was a fact that he looked full in the face. But what\nvictory can be won without danger? And he thought that he knew this\ngirl, who three times a year would open her whole heart to him in\nconfession. He was sure that she was not only innocent, but good. And\nof the man, too, he was prone to believe good;--though who on such a\nquestion ever trusts a man's goodness? There might be danger and there\nmust be discretion; but surely it would not be wise, because evil\nwas possible, that such a one as Kate O'Hara should be kept from all\nthat intercourse without which a woman is only half a woman! He had\nconsidered it all, though the reader may perhaps think that as a\nminister of the gospel he had come to a strange conclusion. He himself,\nin his own defence, would have said that having served many years in the\nministry he had learned to know the nature of men and women.\n\nMrs. O'Hara said not a word to Kate of the doctrines which the priest\nhad preached, but she found herself encouraged to mention their new\nfriend's name to the girl. During Fred's absence hardly a word had\nbeen spoken concerning him in the cottage. Mrs. O'Hara had feared the\nsubject, and Kate had thought of him much too often to allow his name to\nbe on her tongue. But now as they sat after dinner over their peat fire\nthe mother began the subject. \"Mr. Neville is to dine with Father Marty\non Thursday.\"\n\n\"Is he, mother?\"\n\n\"Barney Morony was telling me that he was back at Ennis. Barney had to\ngo in and see him about the boat.\"\n\n\"He won't go boating such weather as this, mother?\"\n\n\"It seems that he means it. The winds are not so high now as they were\nin October, and the men understand well when the sea will be high.\"\n\n\"It is frightful to think of anybody being in one of those little boats\nnow.\" Kate ever since she had lived in these parts had seen the canoes\nfrom Liscannor and Lahinch about in the bay, summer and winter, and had\nnever found anything dreadful in it before.\n\n\"I suppose he'll come up here again,\" said the mother; but to this Kate\nmade no answer. \"He is to sleep at Father Marty's I fancy, and he can\nhardly do that without paying us a visit.\"\n\n\"The days are short and he'll want all his time for the boating,\" said\nKate with a little pout.\n\n\"He'll find half-an-hour, I don't doubt. Shall you be glad to see him,\nKate?\"\n\n\"I don't know, mother. One is glad almost to see any one up here. It's\nas good as a treat when old Corcoran comes up with the turf.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Neville is not like old Corcoran, Kate.\"\n\n\"Not in the least, mother. I do like Mr. Neville better than Corcoran,\nbecause you see with Corcoran the excitement is very soon over. And\nCorcoran hasn't very much to say for himself.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Neville has?\"\n\n\"He says a great deal more to you than he does to me, mother.\"\n\n\"I like him very much. I should like him very much indeed if there were\nno danger in his coming.\"\n\n\"What danger?\"\n\n\"That he should steal your heart away, my own, my darling, my child.\"\nThen Kate, instead of answering, got up and threw herself at her\nmother's knees, and buried her face in her mother's lap, and Mrs. O'Hara\nknew that that act of larceny had already been perpetrated.\n\nAnd how should it have been otherwise? But of such stealing it is always\nbetter that no mention should be made till the theft has been sanctified\nby free gift. Till the loss has been spoken of and acknowledged, it may\nin most cases be recovered. Had Neville never returned from Scroope, and\nhis name never been mentioned by the mother to her daughter, it may be\nthat Kate O'Hara would not have known that she had loved him. For a\nwhile she would have been sad. For a month or two, as she lay wakeful in\nher bed she would have thought of her dreams. But she would have thought\nof them as only dreams. She would have been sure that she could have\nloved him had any fair ending been possible for such love; but she would\nhave assured herself that she had been on her guard, and that she was\nsafe in spite of her dreams. But now the flame in her heart had been\nconfessed and in some degree sanctioned, and she would foster it rather\nthan quench it. Even should such a love be capable of no good fortune,\nwould it not be better to have a few weeks of happy dreaming than a\nwhole life that should be passionless? What could she do with her own\nheart there, living in solitude, with none but the sea gulls to look at\nher? Was it not infinitely better that she should give it away to such a\nyoung god as this than let it feed upon itself miserably? Yes, she would\ngive it away;--but might it not be that the young god would not take the\ngift?\n\nOn the third day after his arrival at Ennis, Neville was at Liscannor\nwith the priest. He little dreamed that the fact of his dining and\nsleeping at Father Marty's house would be known to the ladies at Castle\nQuin, and communicated from them to his aunt at Scroope Manor. Not that\nhe would have been deterred from accepting the priest's hospitality or\nfrightened into accepting that of the noble owner of the castle, had he\nknown precisely all that would be written about it. He would not have\naltered his conduct in a matter in which he considered himself entitled\nto regulate it, in obedience to any remonstrances from Scroope Manor.\nObjections to the society of a Roman Catholic priest because of his\nreligion he would have regarded as old-fashioned fanaticism. As for\nEarls and their daughters he would no doubt have enough of them in his\nfuture life, and this special Earl and his daughters had not fascinated\nhim. He had chosen to come to Ireland with his regiment for this year\ninstead of at once assuming the magnificence of his position in England,\nin order that he might indulge the spirit of adventure before he assumed\nthe duties of life. And it seemed to him that in dining and sleeping at\nan Irish priest's house on the shores of the Atlantic, with the prospect\nof seal shooting and seeing a very pretty girl on the following morning,\nhe was indulging that spirit properly. But Lady Mary Quin thought that\nhe was misbehaving himself and taking to very bad courses. When she\nheard that he was to sleep at the priest's house, she was quite sure\nthat he would visit Mrs. O'Hara on the next day.\n\nThe dinner at the priest's was very jovial. There was a bottle of sherry\nand there was a bottle of port, procured, chiefly for the sake of\nappearance, from a grocer's shop at Ennistimon;--but the whiskey had\ncome from Cork and had been in the priest's keeping for the last dozen\nyears. He good-humouredly acknowledged that the wine was nothing, but\nexpressed an opinion that Mr. Neville might find it difficult to beat\nthe \"sperrits.\" \"It's thrue for you, Father Marty,\" said the rival\npriest from Milltown Malbay, \"and it's you that should know good\nsperrits from bad if ony man in Ireland does.\"\n\n\"'Deed thin,\" replied the priest of Liscannor, \"barring the famine\nyears, I've mixed two tumblers of punch for meself every day these\nforty years, and if it was all together it'd be about enough to give\nMr. Neville a day's sale-shooting on in his canoe.\" Immediately after\ndinner Neville was invited to light his cigar, and everything was easy,\ncomfortable, and to a certain degree adventurous. There were the two\npriests, and a young Mr. Finucane from Ennistimon,--who however was\nnot quite so much to Fred's taste as the elder men. Mr. Finucane wore\nvarious rings, and talked rather largely about his father's demesne. But\nthe whole thing was new, and by no means dull. As Neville had not left\nEnnis till late in the day,--after what he called a hard day's work in\nthe warrior line,--they did not sit down till past eight o'clock; nor\ndid any one talk of moving till past midnight. Fred certainly made for\nhimself more than two glasses of punch, and he would have sworn that the\npriest had done so also. Father Marty, however, was said by those who\nknew him best to be very rigid in this matter, and to have the faculty\nof making his drink go a long way. Young Mr. Finucane took three or\nfour,--perhaps five or six,--and then volunteered to join Fred Neville\nin a day's shooting under the rocks. But Fred had not been four years\nin a cavalry regiment without knowing how to protect himself in such a\ndifficulty as this. \"The canoe will only hold myself and the man,\" said\nFred, with perfect simplicity. Mr. Finucane drew himself up haughtily\nand did not utter another word for the next five minutes. Nevertheless\nhe took a most affectionate leave of the young officer when half an hour\nafter midnight he was told by Father Marty that it was time for him to\ngo home. Father Creech also took his leave, and then Fred and the priest\nof Liscannor were left sitting together over the embers of the turf\nfire. \"You'll be going up to see our friends at Ardkill to-morrow,\" said\nthe priest.\n\n\"Likely enough, Father Marty.\"\n\n\"In course you will. Sorrow a doubt of that.\" Then the priest paused.\n\n\"And why shouldn't I?\" asked Neville.\n\n\"I'm not saying that you shouldn't, Mr. Neville. It wouldn't be civil\nnor yet nathural after knowing them as you have done. If you didn't go\nthey'd be thinking there was a rason for your staying away, and that'd\nbe worse than all. But, Mr. Neville--\"\n\n\"Out with it, Father Marty.\" Fred knew what was coming fairly well, and\nhe also had thought a good deal upon the matter.\n\n\"Them two ladies, Mr. Neville, live up there all alone, with sorrow a\nhuman being in the world to protect them,--barring myself.\"\n\n\"Why should they want protection?\"\n\n\"Just because they're lone women, and because one of them is very young\nand very beautiful.\"\n\n\"They are both beautiful,\" said Neville.\n\n\"'Deed and they are,--both of 'em. The mother can look afther herself,\nand after a fashion, too, she can look afther her daughter. I shouldn't\nlike to be the man to come in her way when he'd once decaived her child.\nYou're a young man, Mr. Neville.\"\n\n\"That's my misfortune.\"\n\n\"And one who stands very high in the world. They tell me you're to be a\ngreat lord some day.\"\n\n\"Either that or a little one,\" said Neville, laughing.\n\n\"Anyways you'll be a rich man with a handle to your name. To me, living\nhere in this out of the way parish, a lord doesn't matter that.\" And\nFather Marty gave a fillip with his fingers. \"The only lord that matters\nme is me bishop. But with them women yonder, the title and the money and\nall the grandeur goes a long way. It has been so since the world began.\nIn riding a race against you they carry weight from the very awe which\nthe name of an English Earl brings with it.\"\n\n\"Why should they ride a race against me?\"\n\n\"Why indeed,--unless you ride a race against them! You wouldn't wish to\ninjure that young thing as isn't yet out of her teens?\"\n\n\"God forbid that I should injure her.\"\n\n\"I don't think that you're the man to do it with your eyes open, Mr.\nNeville. If you can't spake her fair in the way of making her your wife,\ndon't spake her fair at all. That's the long and the short of it, Mr.\nNeville. You see what they are. They're ladies, if there is a lady\nliving in the Queen's dominions. That young thing is as beautiful\nas Habe, as innocent as a sleeping child, as soft as wax to take\nimpression. What armour has she got against such a one as you?\"\n\n\"She shall not need armour.\"\n\n\"If you're a gentleman, Mr. Neville,--as I know you are,--you will not\ngive her occasion to find out her own wakeness. Well, if it isn't past\none I'm a sinner. It's Friday morning and I mus'n't ate a morsel myself,\npoor papist that I am; but I'll get you a bit of cold mate and a drop\nof grog in a moment if you'll take it.\" Neville, however, refused the\nhospitable offer.\n\n\"Father Marty,\" he said, speaking with a zeal which perhaps owed\nsomething of its warmth to the punch, \"you shall find that I am a\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"I'm shure of it, my boy.\"\n\n\"If I can do no good to your friend, at any rate I will do no harm to\nher.\"\n\n\"That is spoken like a Christian, Mr. Neville,--which I take to be a\nhigher name even than gentleman.\"\n\n\"There's my hand upon it,\" said Fred, enthusiastically. After that he\nwent to bed.\n\nOn the following morning the priest was very jolly at breakfast, and\nin speaking of the ladies at Ardkill made no allusion whatever to the\nconversation of the previous evening. \"Ah no,\" he said, when Neville\nproposed that they should walk up together to the cottage before he\nwent down to his boat. \"What's the good of an ould man like me going\nbothering? And, signs on, I'm going into Ennistimon to see Pat O'Leary\nabout the milk he's sending to our Union. The thief of the world,--it's\nwathering it he is before he sends it. Nothing kills me, Mr. Neville,\nbut when I hear of all them English vices being brought over to this\npoor suffering innocent counthry.\"\n\nNeville had decided on the advice of Barney Morony, that he would on\nthis morning go down southward along the coast to Drumdeirg rock, in the\ndirection away from the Hag's Head and from Mrs. O'Hara's cottage; and\nhe therefore postponed his expedition till after his visit. When Father\nMarty started to Ennistimon to look after that sinner O'Leary, Fred\nNeville, all alone, turned the other way to Ardkill.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nI DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GO.\n\n\nMrs. O'Hara had known that he would come, and Kate had known it; and,\nthough it would be unfair to say that they were waiting for him, it is\nno more than true to say that they were ready for him. \"We are so glad\nto see you again,\" said Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\"Not more glad than I am to find myself here once more.\"\n\n\"So you dined and slept at Father Marty's last night. What will the\ngrand people say at the Castle?\"\n\n\"As I sha'n't hear what they say, it won't matter much! Life is not\nlong enough, Mrs. O'Hara, for putting up with disagreeable people.\"\n\n\"Was it pleasant last night?\"\n\n\"Very pleasant. I don't think Father Creech is half as good as Father\nMarty, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" exclaimed Kate.\n\n\"But he's a jolly sort of fellow, too. And there was a Mr. Finucane\nthere,--a very grand fellow.\"\n\n\"We know no one about here but the priests,\" said Mrs. O'Hara, laughing.\n\"Anybody might think that the cottage was a little convent.\"\n\n\"Then I oughtn't to come.\"\n\n\"Well, no, I suppose not. Only foreigners are admitted to see convents\nsometimes. You're going after the poor seals again?\"\n\n\"Barney says the tide is too high for the seals now. We're going to\nDrumdeirg.\"\n\n\"What,--to those little rocks?\" asked Kate.\n\n\"Yes,--to the rocks. I wish you'd both come with me.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't go in one of those canoes all out there for the world,\" said\nKate.\n\n\"What can be the use of it?\" asked Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\"I've got to get the feathers for Father Marty's bed, you know. I\nhaven't shot as many yet as would make a pillow for a cradle.\"\n\n\"The poor innocent gulls!\"\n\n\"The poor innocent chickens and ducks, if you come to that, Miss\nO'Hara.\"\n\n\"But they're of use.\"\n\n\"And so will Father Marty's feather bed be of use. Good-bye, Mrs.\nO'Hara. Good-bye, Miss O'Hara. I shall be down again next week, and\nwe'll have that other seal.\"\n\nThere was nothing in this. So far, at any rate, he had not broken his\nword to the priest. He had not spoken a word to Kate O'Hara that might\nnot and would not have been said had the priest been present. But how\nlovely she was; and what a thrill ran through his arm as he held her\nhand in his for a moment. Where should he find a girl like that in\nEngland with such colour, such eyes, such hair, such innocence,--and\nthen with so sweet a voice?\n\nAs he hurried down the hill to the beach at Coolroone, where Morony was\nto meet him with the boat, he could not keep himself from comparisons\nbetween Kate O'Hara and Sophie Mellerby. No doubt his comparisons were\nmade very incorrectly,--and unfairly; but they were all in favour of the\ngirl who lived out of the world in solitude on the cliffs of Moher. And\nwhy should he not be free to seek a wife where he pleased? In such an\naffair as that,--an affair of love in which the heart and the heart\nalone should be consulted, what right could any man have to dictate to\nhim? Certain ideas occurred to him which his friends in England would\nhave called wild, democratic, revolutionary and damnable, but which,\nowing perhaps to the Irish air and the Irish whiskey and the spirit of\nadventure fostered by the vicinity of rocks and ocean, appeared to him\nat the moment to be not only charming but reasonable also. No doubt he\nwas born to high state and great rank, but nothing that his rank and\nstate could give him was so sweet as his liberty. To be free to choose\nfor himself in all things, was the highest privilege of man. What\npleasure could he have in a love which should be selected for him by\nsuch a woman as his aunt? Then he gave the reins to some confused notion\nof an Irish bride, a wife who should be half a wife and half not,--whom\nhe would love and cherish tenderly but of whose existence no English\nfriend should be aware. How could he more charmingly indulge his spirit\nof adventure than by some such arrangement as this?\n\nHe knew that he had given a pledge to his uncle to contract no marriage\nthat would be derogatory to his position. He knew also that he had given\na pledge to the priest that he would do no harm to Kate O'Hara. He felt\nthat he was bound to keep each pledge. As for that sweet, darling girl,\nwould he not sooner lose his life than harm her? But he was aware that\nan adventurous life was always a life of difficulties, and that for such\nas live adventurous lives the duty of overcoming difficulties was of all\nduties the chief. Then he got into his canoe, and, having succeeded in\nkilling two gulls on the Drumdeirg rocks, thought that for that day he\nhad carried out his purpose as a man of adventure very well.\n\nDuring February and March he was often on the coast, and hardly one\nvisit did he make which was not followed by a letter from Castle Quin\nto Scroope Manor. No direct accusation of any special fault was made\nagainst him in consequence. No charge was brought of an improper\nhankering after any special female, because Lady Scroope found herself\nbound in conscience not to commit her correspondent; but very heavy\ninjunctions were laid upon him as to his general conduct, and he was\neagerly entreated to remember his great duty and to come home and settle\nhimself in England. In the mean time the ties which bound him to the\ncoast of Clare were becoming stronger and stronger every day. He had\nceased now to care much about seeing Father Marty, and would come, when\nthe tide was low, direct from Lahinch to the strand beneath the cliffs,\nfrom whence there was a path through the rocks up to Ardkill. And there\nhe would remain for hours,--having his gun with him, but caring little\nfor his gun. He told himself that he loved the rocks and the wildness of\nthe scenery, and the noise of the ocean, and the whirring of the birds\nabove and below him. It was certainly true that he loved Kate O'Hara.\n\n\"Neville, you must answer me a question,\" said the mother to him one\nmorning when they were out together, looking down upon the Atlantic when\nthe wind had lulled after a gale.\n\n\"Ask it then,\" said he.\n\n\"What is the meaning of all this? What is Kate to believe?\"\n\n\"Of course she believes that I love her better than all the world\nbesides,--that she is more to me than all the world can give or take. I\nhave told her at least, so often, that if she does not believe it she is\nlittle better than a Jew.\"\n\n\"You must not joke with me now. If you knew what it was to have one\nchild and only that you would not joke with me.\"\n\n\"I am quite in earnest. I am not joking.\"\n\n\"And what is to be the end of it?\"\n\n\"The end of it! How can I say? My uncle is an old man,--very old, very\ninfirm, very good, very prejudiced, and broken-hearted because his own\nson, who died, married against his will.\"\n\n\"You would not liken my Kate to such as that woman was?\"\n\n\"Your Kate! She is my Kate as much as yours. Such a thought as that\nwould be an injury to me as deep as to you. You know that to me my Kate,\nour Kate, is all excellence,--as pure and good as she is bright and\nbeautiful. As God is above us she shall be my wife,--but I cannot take\nher to Scroope Manor as my wife while my uncle lives.\"\n\n\"Why should any one be ashamed of her at Scroope Manor?\"\n\n\"Because they are fools. But I cannot cure them of their folly. My uncle\nthinks that I should marry one of my own class.\"\n\n\"Class;--what class? He is a gentleman, I presume, and she is a lady.\"\n\n\"That is very true;--so true that I myself shall act upon the truth. But\nI will not make his last years wretched. He is a Protestant, and you are\nCatholics.\"\n\n\"What is that? Are not ever so many of your lords Catholics? Were they\nnot all Catholics before Protestants were ever thought of?\"\n\n\"Mrs. O'Hara, I have told you that to me she is as high and good and\nnoble as though she were a Princess. And I have told you that she shall\nbe my wife. If that does not content you, I cannot help it. It contents\nher. I owe much to her.\"\n\n\"Indeed you do;--everything.\"\n\n\"But I owe much to him also. I do not think that you can gain anything\nby quarrelling with me.\"\n\nShe paused for a while before she answered him, looking into his face\nthe while with something of the ferocity of a tigress. So intent was her\ngaze that his eyes quailed beneath it. \"By the living God,\" she said,\n\"if you injure my child I will have the very blood from your heart.\"\n\nNevertheless she allowed him to return alone to the house, where she\nknew that he would find her girl. \"Kate,\" he said, going into the\nparlour in which she was sitting idle at the window,--\"dear Kate.\"\n\n\"Well, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm off.\"\n\n\"You are always--off, as you call it.\"\n\n\"Well,--yes. But I'm not on and off, as the saying is.\"\n\n\"Why should you go away now?\"\n\n\"Do you suppose a soldier has got nothing to do? You never calculate, I\nthink, that Ennis is about three-and-twenty miles from here. Come, Kate,\nbe nice with me before I go.\"\n\n\"How can I be nice when you are going? I always think when I see you go\nthat you will never come back to me again. I don't know why you should\ncome back to such a place as this?\"\n\n\"Because, as it happens, the place holds what I love best in all the\nworld.\" Then he lifted her from her chair, and put his arm round her\nwaist. \"Do you not know that I love you better than all that the world\nholds?\"\n\n\"How can I know it?\"\n\n\"Because I swear it to you.\"\n\n\"I think that you like me--a little. Oh Fred, if you were to go and\nnever to come back I should die. Do you remember Mariana? 'My life is\ndreary. He cometh not,' she said. She said, 'I am aweary, aweary; I\nwould that I were dead!' Do you remember that? What has mother been\nsaying to you?\"\n\n\"She has been bidding me to do you no harm. It was not necessary. I\nwould sooner pluck out my eye than hurt you. My uncle is an old man,--a\nvery old man. She cannot understand that it is better that we should\nwait, than that I should have to think hereafter that I had killed him\nby my unkindness.\"\n\n\"But he wants you to love some other girl.\"\n\n\"He cannot make me do that. All the world cannot change my heart, Kate.\nIf you can not trust me for that, then you do not love me as I love\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh, Fred, you know I love you. I do trust you. Of course I can wait, if\nI only know that you will come back to me. I only want to see you.\" He\nwas now leaning over her, and her cheek was pressed close to his. Though\nshe was talking of Mariana, and pretending to fear future misery, all\nthis was Elysium to her,--the very joy of Paradise. She could sit and\nthink of him now from morning to night, and never find the day an hour\ntoo long. She could remember the words in which he made his oaths to\nher, and cherish the sweet feeling of his arm round her body. To have\nher cheek close to his was godlike. And then when he would kiss her,\nthough she would rebuke him, it was as though all heaven were in the\nembrace.\n\n\"And now good-bye. One kiss, darling.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Not a kiss when I am going?\"\n\n\"I don't want you to go. Oh, Fred! Well;--there. Good-bye, my own, own,\nown beloved one. You'll be here on Monday?\"\n\n\"Yes,--on Monday.\"\n\n\"And be in the boat four hours, and here four minutes. Don't I know\nyou?\" But he went without answering this last accusation.\n\n\"What shall we do, Kate, if he deceives us?\" said the mother that\nevening.\n\n\"Die. But I am sure he will not deceive us.\"\n\nNeville, as he made his way down to Liscannor, where his gig was waiting\nfor him, did ask himself some serious questions about his adventure.\nWhat must be the end of it? And had he not been imprudent? It may be\ndeclared on his behalf that no idea of treachery to the girl ever\ncrossed his mind. He loved her too thoroughly for that. He did love\nher--not perhaps as she loved him. He had many things in the world to\noccupy his mind, and she had but one. He was almost a god to her. She to\nhim was simply the sweetest girl that he had ever as yet seen, and one\nwho had that peculiar merit that she was all his own. No other man had\never pressed her hand, or drank her sweet breath. Was not such a love a\nthousand times sweeter than that of some girl who had been hurried from\ndrawing-room to drawing-room, and perhaps from one vow of constancy to\nanother for half-a-dozen years? The adventure was very sweet. But how\nwas it to end? His uncle might live these ten years, and he had not the\nheart,--nor yet the courage,--to present her to his uncle as his bride.\n\nWhen he reached Ennis that evening there was a despatch marked\n\"Immediate,\" from his aunt Lady Scroope. \"Your uncle is very\nill;--dangerously ill, we fear. His great desire is to see you once\nagain. Pray come without losing an hour.\"\n\nEarly on the following morning he started for Dublin, but before he\nwent to bed that night he not only wrote to Kate O'Hara, but enclosed\nthe note from his aunt. He could understand that though the tidings of\nhis uncle's danger was a shock to him there would be something in the\ntidings which would cause joy to the two inmates of Ardkill Cottage.\nWhen he sent that letter with his own, he was of course determined that\nhe would marry Kate O'Hara as soon as he was a free man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nFRED NEVILLE RETURNS TO SCROOPE.\n\n\nThe suddenness of the demand made for the heir's presence at Scroope was\nperhaps not owing to the Earl's illness alone. The Earl, indeed, was\nill,--so ill that he thought himself that his end was very near; but his\nillness had been brought about chiefly by the misery to which he had\nbeen subjected by the last despatch from Castle Quin to the Countess. \"I\nam most unwilling,\" she said, \"to make mischief or to give unnecessary\npain to you or to Lord Scroope; but I think it my duty to let you know\nthat the general opinion about here is that Mr. Neville shall make Miss\nO'Hara his wife,--_if he has not done so already_. The most dangerous\nfeature in the whole matter is that it is all managed by the priest of\nthis parish, a most unscrupulous person, who would do anything,--he\nis so daring. We have known him many many years, and we know to what\nlengths he would go. The laws have been so altered in favour of the\nRoman Catholics, and against the Protestants, that a priest can do\nalmost just what he likes. I do not think that he would scruple for an\ninstant to marry them if he thought it likely that his prey would escape\nfrom him. My own opinion is that there has been no marriage as yet,\nthough I know that others think that there has been.\" The expression of\nthis opinion from \"others\" which had reached Lady Mary's ears consisted\nof an assurance from her own Protestant lady's maid that that wicked,\nguzzling old Father Marty would marry the young couple as soon as look\nat them, and very likely had done so already. \"I cannot say,\" continued\nLady Mary, \"that I actually know anything against the character of Miss\nO'Hara. Of the mother we have very strange stories here. They live in a\nlittle cottage with one maid-servant, almost upon the cliffs, and nobody\nknows anything about them except the priest. If he should be seduced\ninto a marriage, nothing could be more unfortunate.\" Lady Mary probably\nintended to insinuate that were young Neville prudently to get out of\nthe adventure, simply leaving the girl behind him blasted, ruined, and\ndestroyed, the matter no doubt would be bad; but in that case the great\nmisfortune would have been avoided. She could not quite say this in\nplain words; but she felt, no doubt, that Lady Scroope would understand\nher. Then Lady Mary went on to assure her friend that though she and her\nfather and sisters very greatly regretted that Mr. Neville had not again\ngiven them the pleasure of seeing him at Castle Quin, no feeling of\ninjury on that score had induced her to write so strongly as she had\ndone. She had been prompted to do so simply by her desire to prevent _a\nmost ruinous alliance_.\n\nLady Scroope acknowledged entirely the truth of these last words. Such\nan alliance would be most ruinous! But what could she do? Were she to\nwrite to Fred and tell him all that she heard,--throwing to the winds\nLady Mary's stupid injunctions respecting secrecy, as she would not have\nscrupled to do could she have thus obtained her object,--might it not be\nquite possible that she would precipitate the calamity which she desired\nso eagerly to avoid? Neither had she nor had her husband any power over\nthe young man, except such as arose from his own good feeling. The Earl\ncould not disinherit him;--could not put a single acre beyond his reach.\nLet him marry whom he might he must be Earl Scroope of Scroope, and the\nwoman so married must be the Countess of Scroope. There was already a\nLady Neville about the world whose existence was a torture to them; and\nif this young man chose also to marry a creature utterly beneath him and\nto degrade the family, no effort on their part could prevent him. But\nif, as seemed probable, he were yet free, and if he could be got to come\nagain among them, it might be that he still had left some feelings on\nwhich they might work. No doubt there was the Neville obstinacy about\nhim; but he had seemed to both of them to acknowledge the sanctity of\nhis family, and to appreciate in some degree the duty which he owed to\nit.\n\nThe emergency was so great that she feared to act alone. She told\neverything to her husband, shewing him Lady Mary's letter, and the\neffect upon him was so great that it made him ill. \"It will be better\nfor me,\" he said, \"to turn my face to the wall and die before I know\nit.\" He took to his bed, and they of his household did think that he\nwould die. He hardly spoke except to his wife, and when alone with\nher did not cease to moan over the destruction which had come upon\nthe house. \"If it could only have been the other brother,\" said Lady\nScroope.\n\n\"There can be no change,\" said the Earl. \"He must do as it lists him\nwith the fortune and the name and the honours of the family.\"\n\nThen on one morning there was a worse bulletin than heretofore given by\nthe doctor, and Lady Scroope at once sent off the letter which was to\nrecall the nephew to his uncle's bedside. The letter, as we have seen,\nwas successful, and Fred, who caused himself to be carried over from\nDorchester to Scroope as fast as post-horses could be made to gallop,\nalmost expected to be told on his arrival that his uncle had departed to\nhis rest. In the hall he encountered Mrs. Bunce the housekeeper. \"We\nthink my lord is a little better,\" said Mrs. Bunce almost in a whisper.\n\"My lord took a little broth in the middle of the day, and we believe\nhe has slept since.\" Then he passed on and found his aunt in the small\nsitting-room. His uncle had rallied a little, she told him. She was very\naffectionate in her manner, and thanked him warmly for his alacrity in\ncoming. When he was told that his uncle would postpone his visit till\nthe next morning he almost began to think that he had been fussy in\ntravelling so quickly.\n\nThat evening he dined alone with his aunt, and the conversation during\ndinner and as they sat for a few minutes after dinner had reference\nsolely to his uncle's health. But, though they were alone on this\nevening, he was surprised to find that Sophie Mellerby was again at\nScroope. Lady Sophia and Mr. Mellerby were up in London, but Sophie was\nnot to join them till May. As it happened, however, she was dining at\nthe parsonage this evening. She must have been in the house when Neville\narrived, but he had not seen her. \"Is she going to live here?\" he\nasked, almost irreverently, when he was first told that she was in the\nhouse. \"I wish she were,\" said Lady Scroope. \"I am childless, and she\nis as dear to me as a daughter.\" Then Fred apologized, and expressed\nhimself as quite willing that Sophie Mellerby should live and die at\nScroope.\n\nThe evening was dreadfully dull. It had seemed to him that the house was\ndarker, and gloomier, and more comfortless than ever. He had hurried\nover to see a dying man, and now there was nothing for him to do but to\nkick his heels. But before he went to bed his ennui was dissipated by\na full explanation of all his aunt's terrors. She crept down to him at\nabout nine, and having commenced her story by saying that she had a\nmatter of most vital importance on which to speak to him, she told him\nin fact all that she had heard from Lady Mary.\n\n\"She is a mischief-making gossiping old maid,\" said Neville angrily.\n\n\"Will you tell me that there is no truth in what she writes?\" asked Lady\nScroope. But this was a question which Fred Neville was not prepared to\nanswer, and he sat silent. \"Fred, tell me the truth. Are you married?\"\n\n\"No;--I am not married.\"\n\n\"I know that you will not condescend to an untruth.\"\n\n\"If so, my word must be sufficient.\"\n\nBut it was not sufficient. She longed to extract from him some repeated\nand prolonged assurance which might bring satisfaction to her own\nmind. \"I am glad, at any rate, to hear that there is no truth in that\nsuspicion.\" To this he would not condescend to reply, but sat glowering\nat her as though in wrath that any question should be asked him about\nhis private concerns. \"You must feel, Fred, for your uncle in such a\nmatter. You must know how important this is to him. You have heard what\nhe has already suffered; and you must know too that he has endeavoured\nto be very good to you.\"\n\n\"I do know that he has,--been very good to me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are angry with me for interfering.\" He would not deny that\nhe was angry. \"I should not do so were it not that your uncle is ill and\nsuffering.\"\n\n\"You have asked me a question and I have answered it. I do not know what\nmore you want of me.\"\n\n\"Will you say that there is no truth in all this that Lady Mary says?\"\n\n\"Lady Mary is an impertinent old maid.\"\n\n\"If you were in your uncle's place, and if you had an heir as to whose\ncharacter in the world you were anxious, you would not think anyone\nimpertinent who endeavoured for the sake of friendship to save your\nname and family from a disreputable connexion.\"\n\n\"I have made no disreputable connexion. I will not allow the word\ndisreputable to be used in regard to any of my friends.\"\n\n\"You do know people of the name of O'Hara?\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\n\"And there is a--young lady?\"\n\n\"I may know a dozen young ladies as to whom I shall not choose to\nconsult Lady Mary Quin.\"\n\n\"You understand what I mean, Fred. Of course I do not wish to ask you\nanything about your general acquaintances. No doubt you meet many girls\nwhom you admire, and I should be very foolish were I to make inquiries\nof you or of anybody else concerning them. I am the last person to be so\ninjudicious. If you will tell me that there is not and never shall be\nany question of marriage between you and Miss O'Hara, I will not say\nanother word.\"\n\n\"I will not pledge myself to anything for the future.\"\n\n\"You told your uncle you would never make a marriage that should be\ndisgraceful to the position which you will be called upon to fill.\"\n\n\"Nor will I.\"\n\n\"But would not this marriage be disgraceful, even were the young lady\never so estimable? How are the old families of the country to be kept\nup, and the old blood maintained if young men, such as you are, will not\nremember something of all that is due to the name which they bear.\"\n\n\"I do not know that I have forgotten anything.\"\n\nThen she paused before she could summon courage to ask him another\nquestion. \"You have made no promise of marriage to Miss O'Hara?\" He sat\ndumb, but still looking at her with that angry frown. \"Surely your uncle\nhas a right to expect that you will answer that question.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure that for his sake it will be much better that no such\nquestions shall be asked me.\"\n\nIn point of fact he had answered the question. When he would not deny\nthat such promise had been made, there could no longer be any doubt of\nthe truth of what Lady Mary had written. Of course the whole truth had\nnow been elicited. He was not married but he was engaged;--engaged to\na girl of whom he knew nothing, a Roman Catholic, Irish, fatherless,\nalmost nameless,--to one who had never been seen in good society, one of\nwhom no description could be given, of whom no record could be made in\nthe peerage that would not be altogether disgraceful, a girl of whom he\nwas ashamed to speak before those to whom he owed duty and submission!\n\nThat there might be a way to escape the evil even yet Lady Scroope\nacknowledged to herself fully. Many men promise marriage but do not\nkeep the promise they have made. This lady, who herself was really\ngood,--unselfish, affectionate, religious, actuated by a sense of\nduty in all that she did, whose life had been almost austerely moral,\nentertained an idea that young men, such as Fred Neville, very commonly\nmade such promises with very little thought of keeping them. She did not\nexpect young men to be governed by principles such as those to which\nyoung ladies are bound to submit themselves. She almost supposed that\nheaven had a different code of laws for men and women in her condition\nof life, and that salvation was offered on very different terms to the\ntwo sexes. The breach of any such promise as the heir of Scroope could\nhave made to such a girl as this Miss O'Hara would be a perjury at which\nJove might certainly be expected to laugh. But in her catalogue there\nwere sins for which no young men could hope to be forgiven; and the sin\nof such a marriage as this would certainly be beyond pardon.\n\nOf the injury which was to be done to Miss O'Hara, it may be said with\ncertainty that she thought not at all. In her eyes it would be no\ninjury, but simple justice,--no more than a proper punishment for\nintrigue and wicked ambition. Without having seen the enemy to the\nfamily of Scroope, or even having heard a word to her disparagement, she\ncould feel sure that the girl was bad,--that these O'Haras were vulgar\nand false impostors, persons against whom she could put out all her\nstrength without any prick of conscience. Women in such matters are\nalways hard against women, and especially hard against those whom they\nbelieve to belong to a class below their own. Certainly no feeling of\nmercy would induce her to hold her hand in this task of saving her\nhusband's nephew from an ill-assorted marriage. Mercy to Miss O'Hara!\nLady Scroope had the name of being a very charitable woman. She gave\naway money. She visited the poor. She had laboured hard to make the\ncottages on the estate clean and comfortable. She denied herself many\nthings that she might give to others. But she would have no more mercy\non such a one as Miss O'Hara, than a farmer's labourer would have on a\nrat!\n\nThere was nothing more now to be said to the heir;--nothing more for the\npresent that could serve the purpose which she had in hand. \"Your uncle\nis very ill,\" she murmured.\n\n\"I was so sorry to hear it.\"\n\n\"We hope now that he may recover. For the last two days the doctor has\ntold us that we may hope.\"\n\n\"I am so glad to find that it is so.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are. You will see him to-morrow after breakfast. He is\nmost anxious to see you. I think sometimes you hardly reflect how much\nyou are to him.\"\n\n\"I don't know why you should say so.\"\n\n\"You had better not speak to him to-morrow about this affair,--of the\nIrish young lady.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,--unless he speaks to me about it.\"\n\n\"He is hardly strong enough yet. But no doubt he will do so before you\nleave us. I hope it may be long before you do that.\"\n\n\"It can't be very long, Aunt Mary.\" To this she said nothing, but bade\nhim good-night and he was left alone. It was now past ten, and he\nsupposed that Miss Mellerby had come in and gone to her room. Why she\nshould avoid him in this way he could not understand. But as for Miss\nMellerby herself, she was so little to him that he cared not at all\nwhether he did or did not see her. All his brightest thoughts were away\nin County Clare, on the cliffs overlooking the Atlantic. They might say\nwhat they liked to him, but he would never be untrue to the girl whom\nhe had left there. His aunt had spoken of the \"affair of--the Irish\nyoung lady;\" and he had quite understood the sneer with which she had\nmentioned Kate's nationality. Why should not an Irish girl be as good as\nany English girl? Of one thing he was quite sure,--that there was much\nmore of real life to be found on the cliffs of Moher than in the gloomy\nchambers of Scroope Manor.\n\nHe got up from his seat feeling absolutely at a loss how to employ\nhimself. Of course he could go to bed, but how terribly dull must life\nbe in a place in which he was obliged to go to bed at ten o'clock\nbecause there was nothing to do. And since he had been there his only\noccupation had been that of listening to his aunt's sermons. He began\nto think that a man might pay too dearly even for being the heir to\nScroope. After sitting awhile in the dark gloom created by a pair of\ncandles, he got up and wandered into the large unused dining-room of the\nmansion. It was a chamber over forty feet long, with dark flock paper\nand dark curtains, with dark painted wainscoating below the paper, and\nhuge dark mahogany furniture. On the walls hung the portraits of the\nScroopes for many generations past, some in armour, some in their robes\nof state, ladies with stiff bodices and high head-dresses, not beauties\nby Lely or warriors and statesmen by Kneller, but wooden, stiff,\nungainly, hideous figures, by artists whose works had, unfortunately,\nbeen more enduring than their names. He was pacing up and down the room\nwith a candle in his hand, trying to realize to himself what life at\nScroope might be with a wife of his aunt's choosing, and his aunt to\nkeep the house for them, when a door was opened at the end of the room,\naway from that by which he had entered, and with a soft noiseless step\nMiss Mellerby entered. She did not see him at first, as the light of her\nown candle was in her eyes, and she was startled when he spoke to her.\nHis first idea was one of surprise that she should be wandering about\nthe house alone at night. \"Oh, Mr. Neville,\" she said, \"you quite took\nme by surprise. How do you do? I did not expect to meet you here.\"\n\n\"Nor I you!\"\n\n\"Since Lord Scroope has been so ill, Lady Scroope has been sleeping in\nthe little room next to his, downstairs, and I have just come from her.\"\n\n\"What do you think of my uncle's state?\"\n\n\"He is better; but he is very weak.\"\n\n\"You see him?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, daily. He is so anxious to see you, Mr. Neville, and so much\nobliged to you for coming. I was sure that you would come.\"\n\n\"Of course I came.\"\n\n\"He wanted to see you this afternoon; but the doctor had expressly\nordered that he should be kept quiet. Good-night. I am so very glad that\nyou are here. I am sure that you will be good to him.\"\n\nWhy should she be glad, and why should she be sure that he would be\ngood to his uncle? Could it be that she also had been told the story of\nKate O'Hara? Then, as no other occupation was possible to him, he took\nhimself to bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nFRED NEVILLE'S SCHEME.\n\n\nOn the next morning after breakfast Neville was taken into his uncle's\nchamber, but there was an understanding that there was to be no\nconversation on disagreeable subjects on this occasion. His aunt\nremained in the room while he was there, and the conversation was\nalmost confined to the expression of thanks on the part of the Earl to\nhis nephew for coming, and of hopes on the part of the nephew that his\nuncle might soon be well. One matter was mooted as to which no doubt\nmuch would be said before Neville could get away. \"I thought it better\nto make arrangements to stay a fortnight,\" said Fred,--as though a\nfortnight were a very long time indeed.\n\n\"A fortnight!\" said the Earl.\n\n\"We won't talk of his going yet,\" replied Lady Scroope.\n\n\"Supposing I had died, he could not have gone back in a fortnight,\" said\nthe Earl in a low moaning voice.\n\n\"My dear uncle, I hope that I may live to see you in your own place here\nat Scroope for many years to come.\" The Earl shook his head, but nothing\nmore was then said on that subject. Fred, however, had carried out his\npurpose. He had been determined to let them understand that he would not\nhold himself bound to remain long at Scroope Manor.\n\nThen he wrote a letter to his own Kate. It was the first time he had\naddressed her in this fashion, and though he was somewhat of a gallant\ngay Lothario, the writing of the letter was an excitement to him. If so,\nwhat must the receipt of it have been to Kate O'Hara! He had promised\nher that he would write to her, and from the moment that he was gone she\nwas anxious to send in to the post-office at Ennistimon for the treasure\nwhich the mail car might bring to her. When she did get it, it was\nindeed a treasure. To a girl who really loves, the first love letter is\na thing as holy as the recollection of the first kiss. \"May I see it,\nKate?\" said Mrs. O'Hara, as her daughter sat poring over the scrap of\npaper by the window.\n\n\"Yes, mamma,--if you please.\" Then she paused a moment. \"But I think\nthat I had rather you did not. Perhaps he did not mean me to shew it.\"\nThe mother did not urge her request, but contented herself with coming\nup behind her child and kissing her. The reader, however, shall have the\nprivilege which was denied to Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\n   DEAREST KATE,\n\n   I got here all alive yesterday at four. I came on as fast as ever\n   I could travel, and hardly got a mouthful to eat after I left\n   Limerick. I never saw such beastliness as they have at the stations.\n   My uncle is much better,--so much so that I shan't remain here very\n   long. I can't tell you any particular news,--except this, that\n   that old cat down at Castle Quin,--the one with the crisp-curled\n   wig,--must have the nose of a dog and the ears of a cat and the eyes\n   of a bird, and she sends word to Scroope of everything that she\n   smells and hears and sees. It makes not the slightest difference to\n   me,--nor to you I should think. Only I hate such interference. The\n   truth is old maids have nothing else to do. If I were you I wouldn't\n   be an old maid.\n\n   I can't quite say how long it will be before I am back at\n   Ardkill, but not a day longer than I can help. Address to Scroope,\n   Dorsetshire,--that will be enough;--to F. Neville, Esq. Give my\n   love to your mother.--As for yourself, dear Kate, if you care for\n   my love, you may weigh mine for your own dear self with your own\n   weights and measures. Indeed you have all my heart.\n\n   Your own F. N.\n\n   There is a young lady here whom it is intended that I shall marry.\n   She is the pink of propriety and really very pretty;--but you need\n   not be a bit jealous. The joke is that my brother is furiously in\n   love with her, and that I fancy she would be just as much in love\n   with him only that she's told not to.--A thousand kisses.\n\n\nIt was not much of a love letter, but there were a few words in it which\nsufficed altogether for Kate's happiness. She was told that she had\nall his heart,--and she believed it. She was told that she need not be\njealous of the proper young lady, and she believed that too. He sent\nher a thousand kisses; and she, thinking that he might have kissed the\npaper, pressed it to her lips. At any rate his hand had rested on it.\nShe would have been quite willing to shew to her mother all these\nexpressions of her lover's love; but she felt that it would not be fair\nto him to expose his allusions to the \"beastliness\" at the stations. He\nmight say what he liked to her; but she understood that she was not at\nliberty to shew to others words which had been addressed to her in the\nfreedom of perfect intimacy.\n\n\"Does he say anything of the old man?\" asked Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\"He says that his uncle is better.\"\n\n\"Threatened folks live long. Does Neville tell you when he will be\nback?\"\n\n\"Not exactly; but he says that he will not stay long. He does not like\nScroope at all. I knew that. He always says that,--that--\"\n\n\"Says what, dear?\"\n\n\"When we are married he will go away somewhere,--to Italy or Greece or\nsomewhere. Scroope he says is so gloomy.\"\n\n\"And where shall I go?\"\n\n\"Oh, mother;--you shall be with us, always.\"\n\n\"No, dear, you must not dream of that. When you have him you will not\nwant me.\"\n\n\"Dear mother. I shall want you always.\"\n\n\"He will not want me. We have no right to expect too much from him,\nKate. That he shall make you his wife we have a right to expect. If he\nwere false to you--\"\n\n\"He is not false. Why should you think him false?\"\n\n\"I do not think it; but if he were--! Never mind. If he be true to you,\nI will not burden him. If I can see you happy, Kate, I will bear all the\nrest.\" That which she would have to bear would be utter solitude for\nlife. She could look forward and see how black and tedious would be her\ndays; but all that would be nothing to her if her child were lifted up\non high.\n\nIt was now the beginning of April, which for sportsmen in England is\nof all seasons the most desperate. Hunting is over. There is literally\nnothing to shoot. And fishing,--even if there were fishing in England\nworth a man's time,--has not begun. A gentleman of enterprise driven\nvery hard in this respect used to declare that there was no remedy for\nApril but to go and fly hawks in Holland. Fred Neville could not fly\nhawks at Scroope, and found that there was nothing for him to do. Miss\nMellerby suggested--books. \"I like books better than anything,\" said\nFred. \"I always have a lot of novels down at our quarters. But a fellow\ncan't be reading all day, and there isn't a novel in the house except\nWalter Scott's and a lot of old rubbish. By-the-bye have you read 'All\nIsn't Gold That Glitters?'\" Miss Mellerby had not read the tale named.\n\"That's what I call a good novel.\"\n\nDay passed after day and it seemed as though he was expected to remain\nat Scroope without any definite purpose, and, worse still, without any\nfixed limit to his visit. At his aunt's instigation he rode about the\nproperty and asked questions as to the tenants. It was all to be his\nown, and in the course of nature must be his own very soon. There could\nnot but be an interest for him in every cottage and every field. But yet\nthere was present to him all the time a schoolboy feeling that he was\ndoing a task; and the occupation was not pleasant to him because it was\na task. The steward was with him as a kind of pedagogue, and continued\nto instruct him during the whole ride. This man only paid so much\na year, and the rent ought to be so much more; but there were\ncircumstances. And \"My Lord\" had been peculiarly good. This farm was\nsupposed to be the best on the estate, and that other the worst. Oh\nyes, there were plenty of foxes. \"My Lord\" had always insisted that the\nfoxes should be preserved. Some of the hunting gentry no doubt had made\ncomplaints, but it was a great shame. Foxes had been seen, two or three\nat a time, the very day after the coverts had been drawn blank. As for\ngame, a head of game could be got up very soon, as there was plenty of\ncorn and the woods were large; but \"My Lord\" had never cared for game.\nThe farmers all shot the rabbits on their own land. Rents were paid to\nthe day. There was never any mistake about that. Of course the land\nwould require to be re-valued, but \"My Lord\" wouldn't hear of such a\nthing being done in his time. The Manor wood wanted thinning very badly.\nThe wood had been a good deal neglected. \"My Lord\" had never liked to\nhear the axe going. That was Grumby Green and the boundary of the estate\nin that direction. The next farm was college property, and was rented\nfive shillings an acre dearer than \"My Lord's\" land. If Mr. Neville\nwished it the steward would show him the limit of the estate on the\nother side to-morrow. No doubt there was a plan of the estate. It was\nin \"My Lord's\" own room, and would shew every farm with its acreage and\nbounds. Fred thought that he would study this plan on the next day\ninstead of riding about with the steward.\n\nHe could not escape from the feeling that he was being taught his lesson\nlike a school-boy, and he did not like it. He longed for the freedom\nof his boat on the Irish coast, and longed for the devotedness of Kate\nO'Hara. He was sure that he loved her so thoroughly that life without\nher was not to be regarded as possible. But certain vague ideas very\ninjurious to the Kate he so dearly loved crossed his brain. Under the\nconstant teaching of his aunt he did recognize it as a fact that he\nowed a high duty to his family. For many days after that first night at\nScroope not a word was said to him about Kate O'Hara. He saw his uncle\ndaily,--probably twice a day; but the Earl never alluded to his Irish\nlove. Lady Scroope spoke constantly of the greatness of the position\nwhich the heir was called upon to fill and of all that was due to the\nhonour of the family. Fred, as he heard her, would shake his head\nimpatiently, but would acknowledge the truth of what she said. He was\ninduced even to repeat the promise which he had made to his uncle,\nand to assure his aunt that he would do nothing to mar or lessen the\ndignity of the name of Neville. He did become, within his own mind,\nindoctrinated with the idea that he would injure the position of the\nearldom which was to be his were he to marry Kate O'Hara. Arguments\nwhich had appeared to him to be absurd when treated with ridicule by\nFather Marty, and which in regard to his own conduct he had determined\nto treat as old women's tales, seemed to him at Scroope to be true\nand binding. The atmosphere of the place, the companionship of Miss\nMellerby, the reverence with which he himself was treated by the\ndomestics, the signs of high nobility which surrounded him on all sides,\nhad their effect upon him. Noblesse oblige. He felt that it was so. Then\nthere crossed his brain visions of a future life which were injurious to\nthe girl he loved.\n\nLet his brother Jack come and live at Scroope and marry Sophie Mellerby.\nAs long as he lived Jack could not be the Earl, but in regard to money\nhe would willingly make such arrangements as would enable his brother\nto maintain the dignity and state of the house. They would divide the\nincome. And then he would so arrange his matters with Kate O'Hara that\nhis brother's son should be heir to the Earldom. He had some glimmering\nof an idea that as Kate was a Roman Catholic a marriage ceremony might\nbe contrived of which this would become the necessary result. There\nshould be no deceit. Kate should know it all, and everything should be\ndone to make her happy. He would live abroad, and would not call himself\nby his title. They would be Mr. and Mrs. Neville. As to the property,\nthat must of course hereafter go with the title, but in giving up so\nmuch to his brother, he could of course arrange as to the provision\nnecessary for any children of his own. No doubt his Kate would like to\nbe the Countess Scroope,--would prefer that a future son of her own\nshould be the future Earl. But as he was ready to abandon so much,\nsurely she would be ready to abandon something. He must explain to\nher,--and to her mother,--that under no other circumstances could he\nmarry her. He must tell her of pledges made to his uncle before he knew\nher, of the duty which he owed to his family, and of his own great\ndislike to the kind of life which would await him as acting head of the\nfamily. No doubt there would be scenes,--and his heart quailed as he\nremembered certain glances which had flashed upon him from the eyes of\nMrs. O'Hara. But was he not offering to give up everything for his love?\nHis Kate should be his wife after some Roman Catholic fashion in some\nRoman Catholic country. Of course there would be difficulties,--the\nleast of which would not be those glances from the angry mother; but\nit would be his business to overcome difficulties. There were always\ndifficulties in the way of any man who chose to leave the common grooves\nof life and to make a separate way for himself. There were always\ndifficulties in the way of adventures. Dear Kate! He would never desert\nhis Kate. But his Kate must do as much as this for him. Did he not\nintend that, whatever good things the world might have in store for him,\nhis Kate should share them all?\n\nHis ideas were very hazy, and he knew himself that he was ignorant of\nthe laws respecting marriage. It occurred to him, therefore, that he had\nbetter consult his brother, and confide everything to him. That Jack was\nwiser than he, he was always willing to allow; and although he did in\nsome sort look down upon Jack as a plodding fellow, who shot no seals\nand cared nothing for adventure, still he felt it to be almost a pity\nthat Jack should not be the future Earl. So he told his aunt that he\nproposed to ask his brother to come to Scroope for a day or two before\nhe returned to Ireland. Had his aunt, or would his uncle have, any\nobjection? Lady Scroope did not dare to object. She by no means wished\nthat her younger nephew should again be brought within the influence\nof Miss Mellerby's charms; but it would not suit her purpose to give\noffence to the heir by refusing so reasonable request. He would have\nbeen off to join his brother at Woolwich immediately. So the invitation\nwas sent, and Jack Neville promised that he would come.\n\nFred knew nothing of the offer that had been made to Miss Mellerby,\nthough he had been sharp enough to discern his brother's feelings. \"My\nbrother is coming here to-morrow,\" he said one morning to Miss Mellerby\nwhen they were alone together.\n\n\"So Lady Scroope has told me. I don't wonder that you should wish to see\nhim.\"\n\n\"I hope everybody will be glad to see him. Jack is just about the very\nbest fellow in the world;--and he's one of the cleverest too.\"\n\n\"It is so nice to hear one brother speak in that way of another.\"\n\n\"I swear by Jack. He ought to have been the elder brother;--that's the\ntruth. Don't you like him?\"\n\n\"Who;--I. Oh, yes, indeed. What I saw of him I liked very much.\"\n\n\"Isn't it a pity that he shouldn't have been the elder?\"\n\n\"I can't say that, Mr. Neville.\"\n\n\"No. It wouldn't be just civil to me. But I can say it. When we were\nhere last winter I thought that my brother was--\"\n\n\"Was what, Mr Neville?\"\n\n\"Was getting to be very fond of you. Perhaps I ought not to say so.\"\n\n\"I don't think that much good is ever done by saying that kind of\nthing,\" said Miss Mellerby gravely.\n\n\"It cannot at any rate do any harm in this case. I wish with all my\nheart that he was fond of you and you of him.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense. Indeed it is.\"\n\n\"I am not saying it without an object. I don't see why you and I should\nnot understand one another. If I tell you a secret will you keep it?\"\n\n\"Do not tell me any secret that I must keep from Lady Scroope.\"\n\n\"But that is just what you must do.\"\n\n\"But then suppose I don't do it,\" said Miss Mellerby.\n\nBut Fred was determined to tell his secret. \"The truth is that both my\nuncle and my aunt want me to fall in love with you.\"\n\n\"How very kind of them,\" said she with a little forced laugh.\n\n\"I don't for a moment think that, had I tried it on ever so, I could\nhave succeeded. I am not at all the sort of man to be conceited in that\nway. Wishing to do the best they could for me, they picked you out. It\nisn't that I don't think as well of you as they do, but--\"\n\n\"Really, Mr. Neville, this is the oddest conversation.\"\n\n\"Quite true. It is odd. But the fact is you are here, and there is\nnobody else I can talk to. And I want you to know the exact truth. I'm\nengaged to--somebody else.\"\n\n\"I ought to break my heart;--oughtn't I?\"\n\n\"I don't in the least mind your laughing at me. I should have minded it\nvery much if I had asked you to marry me, and you had refused me.\"\n\n\"You haven't given me the chance, you see.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean. What was the good?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Mr. Neville, if you are engaged to some one else. I\nshouldn't like to be Number Two.\"\n\n\"I'm in a peck of troubles;--that's the truth. I would change places\nwith my brother to-morrow if I could. I daresay you don't believe that,\nbut I would. I will not vex my uncle if I can help it, but I certainly\nshall not throw over the girl who loves me. If it wasn't for the title,\nI'd give up Scroope to my brother to-morrow, and go and live in some\nplace where I could get lots of shooting, and where I should never have\nto put on a white choker.\"\n\n\"You'll think better of all that.\"\n\n\"Well!--I've just told you everything because I like to be on the\nsquare. I wish you knew Kate O'Hara. I'm sure you would not wonder that\na fellow should love her. I had rather you didn't tell my aunt what I\nhave told you; but if you choose to do so, I can't help it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTHE WISDOM OF JACK NEVILLE.\n\n\nNeville had been forced to get his leave of absence renewed on the score\nof his uncle's health, and had promised to prolong his absence till the\nend of April. When doing so he had declared his intention of returning\nto Ennis in the beginning of May; but no agreement to that had as yet\nbeen expressed by his uncle or aunt. Towards the end of the month his\nbrother came to Scroope, and up to that time not a word further had been\nsaid to him respecting Kate O'Hara.\n\nHe had received an answer from Kate to his letter, prepared in a fashion\nvery different from that of his own. He had seated himself at a table\nand in compliance with the pledge given by him, had scrawled off his\nepistle as fast as he could write it. She had taken a whole morning to\nthink of hers, and had re-copied it after composing it, and had then\nread it with the utmost care, confessing to herself, almost with tears,\nthat it was altogether unworthy of him to whom it was to be sent. It was\nthe first love letter she had ever written,--probably the first letter\nshe had ever written to a man, except those short notes which she would\noccasionally scrawl to Father Marty in compliance with her mother's\ndirections. The letter to Fred was as follows;--\n\n\n   ARDKILL COTTAGE,\n   10th April, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAREST FRED,\n\n   I received your dear letter three or four days ago, and it made me\n   so happy. We were sorry that you should have such an uncomfortable\n   journey; but all that would be over and soon forgotten when you\n   found yourself in your comfortable home and among your own friends.\n   I am very glad to hear that your uncle is better. The thought of\n   finding him so ill must have made your journey very sad. As he is\n   so much better, I suppose you will come back soon to your poor\n   little Kate.\n\n   There is no news at all to send you from Liscannor. Father Marty\n   was up here yesterday and says that your boat is all safe at\n   Lahinch. He says that Barney Morony is an idle fellow, but as he\n   has nothing to do he can't help being idle. You should come back\n   and not let him be idle any more. I think the sea gulls know that\n   you are away, because they are wheeling and screaming about louder\n   and bolder than ever.\n\n   Mother sends her best love. She is very well. We have had nothing\n   to eat since you went because it has been Lent. So, if you had\n   been here, you would not have been able to get a bit of luncheon.\n   I dare say you have been a great deal better off at Scroope.\n   Father Marty says that you Protestants will have to keep your\n   Lent hereafter,--eighty days at a time instead of forty; and that\n   we Catholics will be allowed to eat just what we like, while you\n   Protestants will have to look on at us. If so, I think I'll manage\n   to give you a little bit.\n\n   Do come back to your own Kate as soon as you can. I need not tell\n   you that I love you better than all the world because you know it\n   already. I am not a bit jealous of the proper young lady, and I\n   hope that she will fall in love with your brother. Then some day\n   we shall be sisters;--shan't we? I should like to have a proper\n   young lady for my sister so much. Only, perhaps she would despise\n   me. Do come back soon. Everything is so dull while you are away!\n   You would come back to your own Kate if you knew how great a joy\n   it is to her when she sees you coming along the cliff.\n\n   Dearest, dearest love, I am always your own, own\n\n   KATE O'HARA.\n\n\nNeville thought of showing Kate's letter to Miss Mellerby, but when\nhe read it a second time he made up his mind that he would keep it to\nhimself. The letter was all very well, and, as regarded the expressions\ntowards himself, just what it should be. But he felt that it was not\nsuch a letter as Miss Mellerby would have written herself, and he was\na little ashamed of all that was said about the priest. Neither was he\nproud of the pretty, finished, French hand-writing, over every letter of\nwhich his love had taken so much pains. In truth, Kate O'Hara was better\neducated than himself, and perhaps knew as much as Sophie Mellerby. She\ncould have written her letter quite as well in French as in English, and\nshe did understand something of the formation of her sentences. Fred\nNeville had been at an excellent school, but it may be doubted whether\nhe could have explained his own written language. Nevertheless he was\na little ashamed of his Kate, and thought that Miss Mellerby might\nperceive her ignorance if he shewed her letter.\n\nHe had sent for his brother in order that he might explain his scheme\nand get his brother's advice;--but he found it very difficult to explain\nhis scheme to Jack Neville. Jack, indeed, from the very first would\nnot allow that the scheme was in any way practicable. \"I don't quite\nunderstand, Fred, what you mean. You don't intend to deceive her by a\nfalse marriage?\"\n\n\"Most assuredly not. I do not intend to deceive her at all.\"\n\n\"You must make her your wife, or not make her your wife.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly she will be my wife. I am quite determined about that. She\nhas my word,--and over and above that, she is dearer to me than anything\nelse.\"\n\n\"If you marry her, her eldest son must of course be the heir to the\ntitle.\"\n\n\"I am not at all so sure of that. All manner of queer things may be\narranged by marriages with Roman Catholics.\"\n\n\"Put that out of your head,\" said Jack Neville. \"In the first place\nyou would certainly find yourself in a mess, and in the next place the\nattempt itself would be dishonest. I dare say men have crept out of\nmarriages because they have been illegal; but a man who arranges a\nmarriage with the intention of creeping out of it is a scoundrel.\"\n\n\"You needn't bully about it, Jack. You know very well that I don't mean\nto creep out of anything.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you don't. But as you ask me I must tell you what I think. You\nare in a sort of dilemma between this girl and Uncle Scroope.\"\n\n\"I'm not in any dilemma at all.\"\n\n\"You seem to think you have made some promise to him which will be\nbroken if you marry her;--and I suppose you certainly have made her a\npromise.\"\n\n\"Which I certainly mean to keep,\" said Fred.\n\n\"All right. Then you must break your promise to Uncle Scroope.\"\n\n\"It was a sort of half and half promise. I could not bear to see him\nmaking himself unhappy about it.\"\n\n\"Just so. I suppose Miss O'Hara can wait.\"\n\nFred Neville scratched his head. \"Oh yes;--she can wait. There's nothing\nto bind me to a day or a month. But my uncle may live for the next ten\nyears now.\"\n\n\"My advice to you is to let Miss O'Hara understand clearly that you will\nmake no other engagement, but that you cannot marry her as long as your\nuncle lives. Of course I say this on the supposition that the affair\ncannot be broken off.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Fred with a decision that was magnanimous.\n\n\"I cannot think the engagement a fortunate one for you in your position.\nLike should marry like. I'm quite sure of that. You would wish your\nwife to be easily intimate with the sort of people among whom she would\nnaturally be thrown as Lady Scroope,--among the wives and daughters of\nother Earls and such like.\"\n\n\"No; I shouldn't.\"\n\n\"I don't see how she would be comfortable in any other way.\"\n\n\"I should never live among other Earls, as you call them. I hate that\nkind of thing. I hate London. I should never live here.\"\n\n\"What would you do?\"\n\n\"I should have a yacht, and live chiefly in that. I should go about\na good deal, and get into all manner of queer places. I don't say\nbut what I might spend a winter now and then in Leicestershire or\nNorthamptonshire, for I am fond of hunting. But I should have no regular\nhome. According to my scheme you should have this place,--and sufficient\nof the income to maintain it of course.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't do, Fred,\" said Jack, shaking his head,--\"though I know\nhow generous you are.\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't it do?\"\n\n\"You are the heir, and you must take the duties with the privileges. You\ncan have your yacht if you like a yacht,--but you'll soon get tired of\nthat kind of life. I take it that a yacht is a bad place for a nursery,\nand inconvenient for one's old boots. When a man has a home fixed for\nhim by circumstances,--as you will have,--he gravitates towards it,\nlet his own supposed predilections be what they may. Circumstances are\nstronger than predilections.\"\n\n\"You're a philosopher.\"\n\n\"I was always more sober than you, Fred.\"\n\n\"I wish you had been the elder,--on the condition of the younger brother\nhaving a tidy slice out of the property to make himself comfortable.\"\n\n\"But I am not the elder, and you must take the position with all the\nencumbrances. I see nothing for it but to ask Miss O'Hara to wait. If my\nuncle lives long the probability is that one or the other of you will\nchange your minds, and that the affair will never come off.\"\n\nWhen the younger and wiser brother gave this advice he did not think\nit all likely that Miss O'Hara would change her mind. Penniless young\nladies don't often change their minds when they are engaged to the heirs\nof Earls. It was not at all probable that she should repent the bargain\nthat she had made. But Jack Neville did think it very probable that his\nbrother might do so;--and, indeed, felt sure that he would do so if\nyears were allowed to intervene. His residence in County Clare would not\nbe perpetual, and with him in his circumstances it might well be that\nthe young lady, being out of sight, should be out of mind. Jack could\nnot exactly declare his opinion on this head. His brother at present was\nfull of his promise, full of his love, full of his honour. Nor would\nJack have absolutely counselled him to break his word to the young\nlady. But he thought it probable that in the event of delay poor Miss\nO'Hara might go to the wall;--and he also thought that for the general\ninterests of the Scroope family it would be better that she should do\nso.\n\n\"And what are you going to do yourself?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"In respect of what?\"\n\n\"In respect of Miss Mellerby?\"\n\n\"In respect of Miss Mellerby I am not going to do anything,\" said Jack\nas he walked away.\n\nIn all that the younger brother said to the elder as to poor Kate O'Hara\nhe was no doubt wise and prudent; but in what he said about himself he\ndid not tell the truth. But then the question asked was one which a man\nis hardly bound to answer, even to a brother. Jack Neville was much less\nlikely to talk about his love affairs than Fred, but not on that account\nless likely to think about them. Sophie Mellerby had refused him once,\nbut young ladies have been known to marry gentlemen after refusing them\nmore than once. He at any rate was determined to persevere, having in\nhimself and in his affairs that silent faith of which the possessor is\nso often unconscious, but which so generally leads to success. He found\nMiss Mellerby to be very courteous to him if not gracious; and he had\nthe advantage of not being afraid of her. It did not strike him that\nbecause she was the granddaughter of a duke, and because he was a\nyounger son, that therefore he ought not to dare to look at her. He\nunderstood very well that she was brought there that Fred might marry\nher;--but Fred was intent on marrying some one else, and Sophie Mellerby\nwas not a girl to throw her heart away upon a man who did not want\nit. He had come to Scroope for only three days, but, in spite of some\nwatchfulness on the part of the Countess, he found his opportunity for\nspeaking before he left the house. \"Miss Mellerby,\" he said, \"I don't\nknow whether I ought to thank Fortune or to upbraid her for having again\nbrought me face to face with you.\"\n\n\"I hope the evil is not so oppressive as to make you very loud in your\nupbraidings.\"\n\n\"They shall not at any rate be heard. I don't know whether there was any\nspice of malice about my brother when he asked me to come here, and told\nme in the same letter that you were at Scroope.\"\n\n\"He must have meant it for malice, I should think,\" said the young lady,\nendeavouring, but not quite successfully, to imitate the manner of the\nman who loved her.\n\n\"Of course I came.\"\n\n\"Not on my behalf, I hope, Mr. Neville.\"\n\n\"Altogether on your behalf. Fred's need to see me was not very great,\nand, as my uncle had not asked me, and as my aunt, I fancy, does not\naltogether approve of me, I certainly should not have come,--were it not\nthat I might find it difficult to get any other opportunity of seeing\nyou.\"\n\n\"That is hardly fair to Lady Scroope, Mr. Neville.\"\n\n\"Quite fair, I think. I did not come clandestinely. I am not ashamed\nof what I am doing,--or of what I am going to do. I may be ashamed of\nthis,--that I should feel my chance of success to be so small. When I\nwas here before I asked you to--allow me to love you. I now ask you\nagain.\"\n\n\"Allow you!\" she said.\n\n\"Yes;--allow me. I should be too bold were I to ask you to return my\nlove at once. I only ask you to know that because I was repulsed once, I\nhave not given up the pursuit.\"\n\n\"Mr. Neville, I am sure that my father and mother would not permit it.\"\n\n\"May I ask your father, Miss Mellerby?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,--with my permission.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless you will not forget that I am suitor for your love?\"\n\n\"I will make no promise of anything, Mr. Neville.\" Then, fearing that\nshe had encouraged him, she spoke again. \"I think you ought to take my\nanswer as final.\"\n\n\"Miss Mellerby, I shall take no answer as final that is not favourable.\nShould I indeed hear that you were to be married to another man, that\nwould be final; but that I shall not hear from your own lips. You will\nsay good-bye to me,\" and he offered her his hand.\n\nShe gave him her hand;--and he raised it to his lips and kissed it, as\nmen were wont to do in the olden days.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nFRED NEVILLE MAKES A PROMISE.\n\n\nFred Neville felt that he had not received from his brother the\nassistance or sympathy which he had required. He had intended to make\na very generous offer,--not indeed quite understanding how his offer\ncould be carried out, but still of a nature that should, he thought,\nhave bound his brother to his service. But Jack had simply answered him\nby sermons;--by sermons and an assurance of the impracticability of\nhis scheme. Nevertheless he was by no means sure that his scheme was\nimpracticable. He was at least sure of this,--that no human power could\nforce him to adopt a mode of life that was distasteful to him. No one\ncould make him marry Sophie Mellerby, or any other Sophie, and maintain\na grand and gloomy house in Dorsetshire, spending his income, not in a\nmanner congenial to him, but in keeping a large retinue of servants\nand taking what he called the \"heavy line\" of an English nobleman.\nThe property must be his own,--or at any rate the life use of it. He\nswore to himself over and over again that nothing should induce him to\nimpoverish the family or to leave the general affairs of the house of\nScroope worse than he found them. Much less than half of that which he\nunderstood to be the income coming from the estates would suffice for\nhim. But let his uncle or aunt,--or his strait-laced methodical brother,\nsay what they would to him, nothing should induce him to make himself a\nslave to an earldom.\n\nBut yet his mind was much confused and his contentment by no means\ncomplete. He knew that there must be a disagreeable scene between\nhimself and his uncle before he returned to Ireland, and he knew also\nthat his uncle could, if he were so minded, stop his present very\nliberal allowance altogether. There had been a bargain, no doubt, that\nhe should remain with his regiment for a year, and of that year six\nmonths were still unexpired. His uncle could not quarrel with him for\ngoing back to Ireland; but what answer should he make when his uncle\nasked him whether he were engaged to marry Miss O'Hara,--as of course he\nwould ask; and what reply should he make when his uncle would demand of\nhim whether he thought such a marriage fit for a man in his position. He\nknew that it was not fit. He believed in the title, in the sanctity of\nthe name, in the mysterious grandeur of the family. He did not think\nthat an Earl of Scroope ought to marry a girl of whom nothing whatever\nwas known. The pride of the position stuck to him;--but it irked him to\nfeel that the sacrifices necessary to support that pride should fall on\nhis own shoulders.\n\nOne thing was impossible to him. He would not desert his Kate. But he\nwished to have his Kate, as a thing apart. If he could have given six\nmonths of each year to his Kate, living that yacht-life of which he had\nspoken, visiting those strange sunny places which his imagination had\npictured to him, unshackled by conventionalities, beyond the sound of\nchurch bells, unimpeded by any considerations of family,--and then have\nmigrated for the other six months to his earldom and his estates, to\nhis hunting and perhaps to Parliament, leaving his Kate behind him,\nthat would have been perfect. And why not? In the days which must come\nso soon, he would be his own master. Who could impede his motions or\ngainsay his will? Then he remembered his Kate's mother, and the glances\nwhich would come from the mother's eyes. There might be difficulty even\nthough Scroope were all his own.\n\nHe was not a villain;--simply a self-indulgent spoiled young man who had\nrealized to himself no idea of duty in life. He never once told himself\nthat Kate should be his mistress. In all the pictures which he drew for\nhimself of a future life everything was to be done for her happiness and\nfor her gratification. His yacht should be made a floating bower for\nher delight. During those six months of the year which, and which only,\nthe provoking circumstances of his position would enable him to devote\nto joy and love, her will should be his law. He did not think himself\nto be fickle. He would never want another Kate. He would leave her\nwith sorrow. He would return to her with ecstasy. Everybody around him\nshould treat her with the respect due to an empress. But it would be\nvery expedient that she should be called Mrs. Neville instead of Lady\nScroope. Could things not be so arranged for him;--so arranged that he\nmight make a promise to his uncle, and yet be true to his Kate without\nbreaking his promise? That was his scheme. Jack said that his scheme was\nimpracticable. But the difficulties in his way were not, he thought, so\nmuch those which Jack had propounded as the angry eyes of Kate O'Hara's\nmother.\n\nAt last the day was fixed for his departure. The Earl was already so\nmuch better as to be able to leave his bedroom. Twice or thrice a day\nFred saw his uncle, and there was much said about the affairs of the\nestate. The heir had taken some trouble, had visited some of the\ntenants, and had striven to seem interested in the affairs of the\nproperty. The Earl could talk for ever about the estate, every field,\nevery fence, almost every tree on which was familiar to him. That\nhis tenants should be easy in their circumstances, a protestant,\nchurch-going, rent-paying people, son following father, and daughters\nmarrying as their mothers had married, unchanging, never sinking an inch\nin the social scale, or rising,--this was the wish nearest to his heart.\nFred was well disposed to talk about the tenants as long as Kate O'Hara\nwas not mentioned. When the Earl would mournfully speak of his own\ncoming death, as an event which could not now be far distant, Fred with\nfullest sincerity would promise that his wishes should be observed. No\nrents should be raised. The axe should be but sparingly used. It seemed\nto him strange that a man going into eternity should care about this\ntree or that;--but as far as he was concerned the trees should stand\nwhile Nature supported them. No servant should be dismissed. The\ncarriage horses should be allowed to die on the place. The old charities\nshould be maintained. The parson of the parish should always be a\nwelcome guest at the Manor. No promise was difficult for him to make so\nlong as that one question were left untouched.\n\nBut when he spoke of the day of his departure as fixed,--as being \"the\nday after to-morrow,\"--then he knew that the question must be touched.\n\"I am sorry,--very sorry, that you must go,\" said the Earl.\n\n\"You see a man can't leave the service at a moment's notice.\"\n\n\"I think that we could have got over that, Fred.\"\n\n\"Perhaps as regards the service we might, but the regiment would think\nill of me. You see, so many things depend on a man's staying or going.\nThe youngsters mayn't have their money ready. I said I should remain\ntill October.\"\n\n\"I don't at all wish to act the tyrant to you.\"\n\n\"I know that, uncle.\"\n\nThen there was a pause. \"I haven't spoken to you yet, Fred, on a matter\nwhich has caused me a great deal of uneasiness. When you first came I\nwas not strong enough to allude to it, and I left it to your aunt.\"\nNeville knew well what was coming now, and was aware that he was moved\nin a manner that hardly became his manhood. \"Your aunt tells me that you\nhave got into some trouble with a young lady in the west of Ireland.\"\n\n\"No trouble, uncle, I hope.\"\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\nThen there was another pause, but he gave a direct answer to the\nquestion. \"She is a Miss O'Hara.\"\n\n\"A Roman Catholic?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"A girl of whose family you know nothing?\"\n\n\"I know that she lives with her mother.\"\n\n\"In absolute obscurity,--and poverty?\"\n\n\"They are not rich,\" said Fred.\n\n\"Do not suppose that I regard poverty as a fault. It is not necessary\nthat you should marry a girl with any fortune.\"\n\n\"I suppose not, Uncle Scroope.\"\n\n\"But I understand that this young lady is quite beneath yourself in\nlife. She lives with her mother in a little cottage, without\nservants,--\"\n\n\"There is a servant.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean, Fred. She does not live as ladies live. She is\nuneducated.\"\n\n\"You are wrong there, my lord. She has been at an excellent school in\nFrance.\"\n\n\"In France! Who was her father, and what?\"\n\n\"I do not know what her father was;--a Captain O'Hara, I believe.\"\n\n\"And you would marry such a girl as that;--a Roman Catholic; picked up\non the Irish coast,--one of whom nobody knows even her parentage or\nperhaps her real name? It would kill me, Fred.\"\n\n\"I have not said that I mean to marry her.\"\n\n\"But what do you mean? Would you ruin her;--seduce her by false promises\nand then leave her? Do you tell me that in cold blood you look forward\nto such a deed as that?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"I hope not, my boy; I hope not that. Do not tell me that a heartless\nscoundrel is to take my name when I am gone.\"\n\n\"I am not a heartless scoundrel,\" said Fred Neville, jumping up from his\nseat.\n\n\"Then what is it that you mean? You have thought, have you not, of the\nduties of the high position to which you are called? You do not suppose\nthat wealth is to be given to you, and a great name, and all the\nappanages and power of nobility, in order that you may eat more, and\ndrink more, and lie softer than others. It is because some think so, and\nact upon such base thoughts, that the only hereditary peerage left in\nthe world is in danger of encountering the ill will of the people. Are\nyou willing to be known only as one of those who have disgraced their\norder?\"\n\n\"I do not mean to disgrace it.\"\n\n\"But you will disgrace it if you marry such a girl as that. If she were\nfit to be your wife, would not the family of Lord Kilfenora have known\nher?\"\n\n\"I don't think much of their not knowing her, uncle.\"\n\n\"Who does know her? Who can say that she is even what she pretends to\nbe? Did you not promise me that you would make no such marriage?\"\n\nHe was not strong to defend his Kate. Such defence would have been in\nopposition to his own ideas, in antagonism with the scheme which he had\nmade for himself. He understood, almost as well as did his uncle, that\nKate O'Hara ought not to be made Countess of Scroope. He too thought\nthat were she to be presented to the world as the Countess of Scroope,\nshe would disgrace the title. And yet he would not be a villain! And yet\nhe would not give her up! He could only fall back upon his scheme. \"Miss\nO'Hara is as good as gold,\" he said; \"but I acknowledge that she is not\nfit to be mistress of this house.\"\n\n\"Fred,\" said the Earl, almost in a passion of affectionate solicitude,\n\"do not go back to Ireland. We will arrange about the regiment. No harm\nshall be done to any one. My health will be your excuse, and the lawyers\nshall arrange it all.\"\n\n\"I must go back,\" said Neville. Then the Earl fell back in his chair and\ncovered his face with his hands. \"I must go back; but I will give you my\nhonour as a gentleman to do nothing that shall distress you.\"\n\n\"You will not marry her?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And, oh, Fred, as you value your own soul, do not injure a poor girl\nso desolate as that. Tell her and tell her mother the honest truth. If\nthere be tears, will not that be better than sorrow, and disgrace, and\nruin?\" Among evils there must always be a choice; and the Earl thought\nthat a broken promise was the lightest of those evils to a choice among\nwhich his nephew had subjected himself.\n\nAnd so the interview was over, and there had been no quarrel. Fred\nNeville had given the Earl a positive promise that he would not marry\nKate O'Hara,--to whom he had sworn a thousand times that she should\nbe his wife. Such a promise, however,--so he told himself--is never\nintended to prevail beyond the lifetime of the person to whom it is\nmade. He had bound himself not to marry Kate O'Hara while his uncle\nlived, and that was all.\n\nOr might it not be better to take his uncle's advice altogether and tell\nthe truth,--not to Kate, for that he could not do,--but to Mrs. O'Hara\nor to Father Marty? As he thought of this he acknowledged to himself\nthat the task of telling such a truth to Mrs. O'Hara would be almost\nbeyond his strength. Could he not throw himself upon the priest's\ncharity, and leave it all to him? Then he thought of his own Kate, and\nsome feeling akin to genuine love told him that he could not part with\nthe girl in such fashion as that. He would break his heart were he to\nlose his Kate. When he looked at it in that light it seemed to him that\nKate was more to him than all the family of the Scroopes with all their\nglory. Dear, sweet, soft, innocent, beautiful Kate! His Kate who, as\nhe knew well, worshipped the very ground on which he trod! It was not\npossible that he should separate himself from Kate O'Hara.\n\nOn his return to Ireland he turned that scheme of his over and over\nagain in his head. Surely something might be done if the priest would\nstand his friend! What if he were to tell the whole truth to the\npriest, and ask for such assistance as a priest might give him? But the\none assurance to which he came during his journey was this;--that when\na man goes in for adventures, he requires a good deal of skill and some\ncourage too to carry him through them.\n\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME II.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nFROM BAD TO WORSE.\n\n\nAs he was returning to Ennis Neville was so far removed from immediate\ndistress as to be able to look forward without fear to his meeting with\nthe two ladies at Ardkill. He could as yet take his Kate in his arms\nwithout any hard load upon his heart, such as would be there if he knew\nthat it was incumbent upon him at once to explain his difficulties. His\nuncle was still living, but was old and still ill. He would naturally\nmake the most of the old man's age and infirmities. There was every\nreason why they should wait, and no reason why such waiting should bring\nreproaches upon his head. On the night of his arrival at his quarters he\ndespatched a note to his Kate.\n\n\n   Dearest love.\n\n   Here I am again in the land of freedom and potatoes. I need not\n   trouble you with writing about home news, as I shall see you the\n   day after to-morrow. All to-morrow and Wednesday morning I must\n   stick close to my guns here. After one on Wednesday I shall be\n   free. I will drive over to Lahinch, and come round in the boat.\n   I must come back here the same night, but I suppose it will be\n   the next morning before I get to bed. I sha'n't mind that if I\n   get something for my pains. My love to your mother. Your own,\n\n   F. N.\n\n\nIn accordance with this plan he did drive over to Lahinch. He might have\nsaved time by directing that his boat should come across the bay to meet\nhim at Liscannor, but he felt that he would prefer not to meet Father\nMarty at present. It might be that before long he would be driven to\ntell the priest a good deal, and to ask for the priest's assistance; but\nat present he was not anxious to see Father Marty. Barney Morony was\nwaiting for him at the stable where he put up his horse, and went down\nwith him to the beach. The ladies, according to Barney, were quite well\nand more winsome than ever. But,--and this information was not given\nwithout much delay and great beating about the bush,--there was a\nrumour about Liscannor that Captain O'Hara had \"turned up.\" Fred was\nso startled at this that he could not refrain from showing his anxiety\nby the questions which he asked. Barney did not seem to think that the\nCaptain had been at Ardkill or anywhere in the neighbourhood. At any\nrate he, Barney, had not seen him. He had just heard the rumour. \"Shure,\nCaptain, I wouldn't be telling yer honour a lie; and they do be saying\nthat the Captain one time was as fine a man as a woman ever sot eyes\non;--and why not, seeing what kind the young lady is, God bless her!\" If\nit were true that Kate's father had \"turned up,\" such an advent might\nvery naturally alter Neville's plans. It would so change the position of\nthings as to relieve him in some degree from the force of his past\npromises.\n\nNevertheless when he saw Kate coming along the cliffs to meet him, the\none thing more certain to him than all other things was that he would\nnever abandon her. She had been watching for him almost from the hour at\nwhich he had said that he would leave Ennis, and, creeping up among the\nrocks, had seen his boat as it came round the point from Liscannor. She\nhad first thought that she would climb down the path to meet him; but\nthe tide was high and there was now no strip of strand below the cliffs;\nand Barney Morony would have been there to see; and she resolved that it\nwould be nicer to wait for him on the summit. \"Oh Fred, you have come\nback,\" she said, throwing herself on his breast.\n\n\"Yes; I am back. Did you think I was going to desert you?\"\n\n\"No; no. I knew you would not desert me. Oh, my darling!\"\n\n\"Dear Kate;--dearest Kate.\"\n\n\"You have thought of me sometimes?\"\n\n\"I have thought of you always,--every hour.\" And so he swore to her that\nshe was as much to him as he could possibly be to her. She hung on his\narm as she went down to the cottage, and believed herself to be the\nhappiest and most fortunate girl in Ireland. As yet no touch of the\nsorrows of love had fallen upon her.\n\nHe could not all at once ask her as to that rumour which Morony had\nmentioned to him. But he thought of it as he walked with his arm round\nher waist. Some question must be asked, but it might, perhaps, be better\nthat he should ask it of the mother. Mrs. O'Hara was at the cottage and\nseemed almost as glad to see him as Kate had been. \"It is very pleasant\nto have you back again,\" she said. \"Kate has been counting first the\nhours, and then the minutes.\"\n\n\"And so have you, mother.\"\n\n\"Of course we want to hear all the news,\" said Mrs. O'Hara. Then\nNeville, with the girl who was to be his wife sitting close beside him\non the sofa,--almost within his embrace,--told them how things were\ngoing at Scroope. His uncle was very weak,--evidently failing; but still\nso much better as to justify the heir in coming away. He might perhaps\nlive for another twelve months, but the doctors thought it hardly\npossible that he should last longer than that. Then the nephew went\non to say that his uncle was the best and most generous man in the\nworld,--and the finest gentleman and the truest Christian. He told also\nof the tenants who were not to be harassed, and the servants who were\nnot to be dismissed, and the horses that were to be allowed to die in\ntheir beds, and the trees that were not to be cut down.\n\n\"I wish I knew him,\" said Kate. \"I wish I could have seen him once.\"\n\n\"That can never be,\" said Fred, sadly.\n\n\"No;--of course not.\"\n\nThen Mrs. O'Hara asked a question. \"Has he ever heard of us?\"\n\n\"Yes;--he has heard of you.\"\n\n\"From you?\"\n\n\"No;--not first from me. There are many reasons why I would not have\nmentioned your names could I have helped it. He has wished me to marry\nanother girl,--and especially a Protestant girl. That was impossible.\"\n\n\"That must be impossible now, Fred,\" said Kate, looking up into his\nface.\n\n\"Quite so, dearest; but why should I have vexed him, seeing that he is\nso good to me, and that he must be gone so soon?\"\n\n\"Who had told him of us?\" asked Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\"That woman down there at Castle Quin.\"\n\n\"Lady Mary?\"\n\n\"Foul-tongued old maid that she is,\" exclaimed Fred. \"She writes to my\naunt by every post, I believe.\"\n\n\"What evil can she say of us?\"\n\n\"She does say evil. Never mind what. Such a woman always says evil of\nthose of her sex who are good-looking.\"\n\n\"There, mother;--that's for you,\" said Kate, laughing. \"I don't care\nwhat she says.\"\n\n\"If she tells your aunt that we live in a small cottage, without\nservants, without society, with just the bare necessaries of life, she\ntells the truth of us.\"\n\n\"That's just what she does say;--and she goes on harping about\nreligion. Never mind her. You can understand that my uncle should be\nold-fashioned. He is very old, and we must wait.\"\n\n\"Waiting is so weary,\" said Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\"It is not weary for me at all,\" said Kate.\n\nThen he left them, without having said a word about the Captain. He\nfound the Captain to be a subject very uncomfortable to mention, and\nthought as he was sitting there that it might perhaps be better to make\nhis first enquiries of this priest. No one said a word to him about the\nCaptain beyond what he had heard from his boatman. For, as it happened,\nhe did not see the priest till May was nearly past, and during all that\ntime things were going from bad to worse. As regarded any services which\nhe rendered to the army at this period of his career, the excuses which\nhe had made to his uncle were certainly not valid. Some pretence at\npositively necessary routine duties it must be supposed that he made;\nbut he spent more of his time either on the sea, or among the cliffs\nwith Kate, or on the road going backwards and forwards, than he did at\nhis quarters. It was known that he was to leave the regiment and become\na great man at home in October, and his brother officers were kind to\nhim. And it was known also, of course, that there was a young lady down\non the sea coast beyond Ennistimon, and doubtless there were jokes on\nthe subject. But there was no one with him at Ennis having such weight\nof fears or authority as might have served to help to rescue him. During\nthis time Lady Mary Quin still made her reports, and his aunt's letters\nwere full of cautions and entreaties. \"I am told,\" said the Countess, in\none of her now detested epistles, \"that the young woman has a reprobate\nfather who has escaped from the galleys. Oh, Fred, do not break our\nhearts.\" He had almost forgotten the Captain when he received this\nfurther rumour which had circulated to him round by Castle Quin and\nScroope Manor.\n\nIt was all going from bad to worse. He was allowed by the mother to be\nat the cottage as much as he pleased, and the girl was allowed to wander\nwith him when she would among the cliffs. It was so, although Father\nMarty himself had more than once cautioned Mrs. O'Hara that she was\nimprudent. \"What can I do?\" she said. \"Have not you yourself taught me\nto believe that he is true?\"\n\n\"Just spake a word to Miss Kate herself.\"\n\n\"What can I say to her now? She regards him as her husband before God.\"\n\n\"But he is not her husband in any way that would prevent his taking\nanother wife an' he plases. And, believe me, Misthress O'Hara, them sort\nof young men like a girl a dale better when there's a little 'Stand off'\nabout her.\"\n\n\"It is too late to bid her to be indifferent to him now, Father Marty.\"\n\n\"I am not saying that Miss Kate is to lose her lover. I hope I'll have\nthe binding of 'em together myself, and I'll go bail I'll do it fast\nenough. In the meanwhile let her keep herself to herself a little more.\"\n\nThe advice was very good, but Mrs. O'Hara knew not how to make use of\nit. She could tell the young man that she would have his heart's blood\nif he deceived them, and she could look at him as though she meant to be\nas good as her word. She had courage enough for any great emergency. But\nnow that the lover had been made free of the cottage she knew not how to\ndebar him. She could not break her Kate's heart by expressing doubts to\nher. And were he to be told to stay away, would he not be lost to them\nfor ever? Of course he could desert them if he would, and then they must\ndie.\n\nIt was going from bad to worse certainly; and not the less so because\nhe was more than ever infatuated about the girl. When he had calculated\nwhether it might be possible to desert her he had been at Scroope. He\nwas in County Clare now, and he did not hesitate to tell himself that\nit was impossible. Whatever might happen, and to whomever he might be\nfalse,--he would be true to her. He would at any rate be so true to her\nthat he would not leave her. If he never made her his legal wife, his\nwife legal at all points, he would always treat her as wife. When his\nuncle the Earl should die, when the time came in which he would be\nabsolutely free as to his own motions, he would discover the way in\nwhich this might best be done. If it were true that his Kate's father\nwas a convict escaped from the galleys, that surely would be an\nadditional reason why she should not be made Countess of Scroope. Even\nMrs. O'Hara herself must understand that. With Kate, with his own Kate,\nhe thought that there would be no difficulty.\n\nFrom bad to worse! Alas, alas; there came a day in which the\npricelessness of the girl he loved sank to nothing, vanished away, and\nwas as a thing utterly lost, even in his eyes. The poor unfortunate\none,--to whom beauty had been given, and grace, and softness,--and\nbeyond all these and finer than these, innocence as unsullied as the\nwhiteness of the plumage on the breast of a dove; but to whom, alas,\nhad not been given a protector strong enough to protect her softness,\nor guardian wise enough to guard her innocence! To her he was godlike,\nnoble, excellent, all but holy. He was the man whom Fortune, more than\nkind, had sent to her to be the joy of her existence, the fountain of\nher life, the strong staff for her weakness. Not to believe in him would\nbe the foulest treason! To lose him would be to die! To deny him would\nbe to deny her God! She gave him all;--and her pricelessness in his eyes\nwas gone for ever.\n\nHe was sitting with her one day towards the end of May on the edge of\nthe cliff, looking down upon the ocean and listening to the waves, when\nit occurred to him that he might as well ask her about her father.\nIt was absurd he thought to stand upon any ceremony with her. He was\nvery good to her, and intended to be always good to her, but it was\nessentially necessary to him to know the truth. He was not aware,\nperhaps, that he was becoming rougher with her than had been his wont.\nShe certainly was not aware of it, though there was a touch of awe\nsometimes about her as she answered him. She was aware that she now\nshewed to him an absolute obedience in all things which had not been\ncustomary with her; but then it was so sweet to obey him; so happy a\nthing to have such a master! If he rebuked her, he did it with his arm\nround her waist, so that she could look into his face and smile as she\npromised that she would be good and follow his behests in all things. He\nhad been telling her now of some fault in her dress, and she had been\nexplaining that such faults would come when money was so scarce. Then he\nhad offered her gifts. A gift she would of course take. She had already\ntaken gifts which were the treasures of her heart. But he must not pay\nthings for her till,--till--. Then she again looked up into his face and\nsmiled. \"You are not angry with me?\" she said.\n\n\"Kate,--I want to ask you a particular question.\"\n\n\"What question?\"\n\n\"You must not suppose, let the answer be what it may, that it can make\nany difference between you and me.\"\n\n\"Oh,--I hope not,\" she replied trembling.\n\n\"It shall make none,\" he answered with all a master's assurance and\nauthority. \"Therefore you need not be afraid to answer me. Tidings have\nreached me on a matter as to which I ought to be informed.\"\n\n\"What matter? Oh Fred, you do so frighten me. I'll tell you anything I\nknow.\"\n\n\"I have been told that--that your father--is alive.\" He looked down\nupon her and could see that her face was red up to her very hair. \"Your\nmother once told me that she had never been certain of his death.\"\n\n\"I used to think he was dead.\"\n\n\"But now you think he is alive?\"\n\n\"I think he is;--but I do not know. I never saw my father so as to\nremember him; though I do remember that we used to be very unhappy when\nwe were in Spain.\"\n\n\"And what have you heard lately? Tell me the truth, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course I shall tell you the truth, Fred. I think mother got a\nletter, but she did not shew it me. She said just a word, but nothing\nmore. Father Marty will certainly know if she knows.\"\n\n\"And you know nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"I think I must ask Father Marty.\"\n\n\"But will it matter to you?\" Kate asked.\n\n\"At any rate it shall not matter to you,\" he said, kissing her. And\nthen again she was happy; though there had now crept across her heart\nthe shadow of some sad foreboding, a foretaste of sorrow that was not\naltogether bitter as sorrow is, but which taught her to cling closely\nto him when he was there and would fill her eyes with tears when she\nthought of him in his absence.\n\nOn this day he had not found Mrs. O'Hara at the cottage. She had gone\ndown to Liscannor, Kate told him. He had sent his boat back to the\nstrand near that village, round the point and into the bay, as it could\nnot well lie under the rocks at high tide, and he now asked Kate to\naccompany him as he walked down. They would probably meet her mother on\nthe road. Kate, as she tied on her hat, was only too happy to be his\ncompanion. \"I think,\" he said, \"that I shall try and see Father Marty as\nI go back. If your mother has really heard anything about your father,\nshe ought to have told me.\"\n\n\"Don't be angry with mother, Fred.\"\n\n\"I won't be angry with you, my darling,\" said the master with masterful\ntenderness.\n\nAlthough he had intimated his intention of calling on the priest that\nvery afternoon, it may be doubted whether he was altogether gratified\nwhen he met the very man with Mrs. O'Hara close to the old burying\nground. \"Ah, Mr. Neville,\" said the priest, \"and how's it all wid you\nthis many a day?\"\n\n\"The top of the morning to you thin, Father Marty,\" said Fred, trying\nto assume an Irish brogue. Nothing could be more friendly than the\ngreeting. The old priest took off his hat to Kate, and made a low bow,\nas though he should say,--to the future Countess of Scroope I owe a very\nespecial respect. Mrs. O'Hara held her future son-in-law's hand for a\nmoment, as though she might preserve him for her daughter by some show\nof affection on her own part. \"And now, Misthress O'Hara,\" said the\npriest, \"as I've got a companion to go back wid me, I'm thinking I'll\nnot go up the hill any further.\" Then they parted, and Kate looked as\nthough she were being robbed of her due because her lover could not give\nher one farewell kiss in the priest's presence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nIS SHE TO BE YOUR WIFE?\n\n\n\"It's quite a sthranger you are, these days,\" said the priest, as soon\nas they had turned their backs upon the ladies.\n\n\"Well; yes. We haven't managed to meet since I came back;--have we?\"\n\n\"I've been pretty constant at home, too. But you like them cliffs up\nthere, better than the village no doubt.\"\n\n\"Metal more attractive, Father Marty,\" said Fred laughing;--\"not meaning\nhowever any slight upon Liscannor or the Cork whisky.\"\n\n\"The Cork whisky is always to the fore, Mr. Neville. And how did you\nlave matters with your noble uncle?\"\n\nNeville at the present moment was anxious rather to speak of Kate's\nignoble father than of his own noble uncle. He had declared his\nintention of making inquiry of Father Marty, and he thought that he\nshould do so with something of a high hand. He still had that scheme\nin his head, and he might perhaps be better prepared to discuss it\nwith the priest if he could first make this friend of the O'Hara family\nunderstand how much he, Neville, was personally injured by this \"turning\nup\" of a disreputable father. But, should he allow the priest at once to\nrun away to Scroope and his noble uncle, the result of such conversation\nwould simply be renewed promises on his part in reference to his future\nconduct to Kate O'Hara.\n\n\"Lord Scroope wasn't very well when I left him. By the bye, Father\nMarty, I've been particularly anxious to see you.\"\n\n\"'Deed thin I was aisy found, Mr. Neville.\"\n\n\"What is this I hear about--Captain O'Hara?\"\n\n\"What is it that you have heard, Mr. Neville?\" Fred looked into the\npriest's face and found that he, at least, did not blush. It may be that\nall power of blushing had departed from Father Marty.\n\n\"In the first place I hear that there is such a man.\"\n\n\"Ony way there was once.\"\n\n\"You think he's dead then?\"\n\n\"I don't say that. It's a matter of,--faith, thin, it's a matter of nigh\ntwenty years since I saw the Captain. And when I did see him I didn't\nlike him. I can tell you that, Mr. Neville.\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"That lass up there was not born when I saw him. He was a handsome man\ntoo, and might have been a gentleman av' he would.\"\n\n\"But he wasn't.\"\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say what is a gentleman, Mr. Neville. I don't know\na much harder thing. Them folk at Castle Quin, now, wouldn't scruple\nto say that I'm no gentleman, just because I'm a Popish priest. I say\nthat Captain O'Hara was no gentleman because--he ill-treated a woman.\"\nFather Marty as he said this stopped a moment on the road, turning round\nand looking Neville full in the face. Fred bore the look fairly well.\nPerhaps at the moment he did not understand its application. It may be\nthat he still had a clear conscience in that matter, and thought that he\nwas resolved to treat Kate O'Hara after a fashion that would in no way\ndetract from his own character as a gentleman. \"As it was,\" continued\nthe priest, \"he was a low blag-guard.\"\n\n\"He hadn't any money, I suppose?\"\n\n\"'Deed and I don't think he was iver throubled much in respect of money.\nBut money doesn't matter, Mr. Neville.\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said Fred.\n\n\"Thim ladies up there are as poor as Job, but anybody that should say\nthat they weren't ladies would just be shewing that he didn't know the\ndifference. The Captain was well born, Mr. Neville, av' that makes ony\nodds.\"\n\n\"Birth does go for something, Father Marty.\"\n\n\"Thin let the Captain have the advantage. Them O'Haras of Kildare\nweren't proud of him I'm thinking, but he was a chip of that block; and\nsome one belonging to him had seen the errors of the family ways, in\nrespect of making him a Papist. 'Deed and I must say, Mr. Neville, when\nthey send us any offsets from a Prothestant family it isn't the best\nthat they give us.\"\n\n\"I suppose not, Father Marty.\"\n\n\"We can make something of a bit of wood that won't take ony shape at\nall, at all along wid them. But there wasn't much to boast of along of\nthe Captain.\"\n\n\"But is he alive, Father Marty;--or is he dead? I think I've a right to\nbe told.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear you ask it as a right, Mr. Neville. You have a right\nif that young lady up there is to be your wife.\" Fred made no answer\nhere, though the priest paused for a moment, hoping that he would do\nso. But the question could be asked again, and Father Marty went on to\ntell all that he knew, and all that he had heard of Captain O'Hara. He\nwas alive. Mrs. O'Hara had received a letter purporting to be from her\nhusband, giving an address in London, and asking for money. He, Father\nMarty, had seen the letter; and he thought that there might perhaps be a\ndoubt whether it was written by the man of whom they were speaking. Mrs.\nO'Hara had declared that if it were so written the handwriting was much\naltered. But then in twelve years the writing of a man who drank hard\nwill change. It was twelve years since she had last received a letter\nfrom him.\n\n\"And what do you believe?\"\n\n\"I think he lives, and that he wrote it, Mr. Neville. I'll tell you\nGod's truth about it as I believe it, because as I said before, I think\nyou are entitled to know the truth.\"\n\n\"And what was done?\"\n\n\"I sent off to London,--to a friend I have.\"\n\n\"And what did your friend say?\"\n\n\"He says there is a man calling himself Captain O'Hara.\"\n\n\"And is that all?\"\n\n\"She got a second letter. She got it the very last day you was down\nhere. Pat Cleary took it up to her when you was out wid Miss Kate.\"\n\n\"He wants money, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Just that, Mr. Neville.\"\n\n\"It makes a difference;--doesn't it?\"\n\n\"How does it make a difference?\"\n\n\"Well; it does. I wonder you don't see it. You must see it.\" From that\nmoment Father Marty said in his heart that Kate O'Hara had lost her\nhusband. Not that he admitted for a moment that Captain O'Hara's return,\nif he had returned, would justify the lover in deserting the girl; but\nthat he perceived that Neville had already allowed himself to entertain\nthe plea. The whole affair had in the priest's estimation been full of\nperil; but then the prize to be won was very great! From the first he\nhad liked the young man, and had not doubted,--did not now doubt,--but\nthat if once married he would do justice to his wife. Even though\nKate should fail and should come out of the contest with a scorched\nheart,--and that he had thought more than probable,--still the prize was\nvery high and the girl he thought was one who could survive such a blow.\nLatterly, in that respect he had changed his opinion. Kate had shewn\nherself to be capable of so deep a passion that he was now sure that\nshe would be more than scorched should the fire be one to injure and\nnot to cherish her. But the man's promises had been so firm, so often\nreiterated, were so clearly written, that the priest had almost dared to\nhope that the thing was assured. Now, alas, he perceived that the embryo\nEnglish lord was already looking for a means of escape, and already\nthought that he had found it in this unfortunate return of the father.\nThe whole extent of the sorrow even the priest did not know. But he was\ndetermined to fight the battle to the very last. The man should make the\ngirl his wife, or he, Father Marty, parish priest of Liscannor, would\nknow the reason why. He was a man who was wont to desire to know the\nreason why, as to matters which he had taken in hand. But when he heard\nthe words which Neville spoke and marked the tone in which they were\nuttered he felt that the young man was preparing for himself a way of\nescape.\n\n\"I don't see that it should make any difference,\" he said shortly.\n\n\"If the man be disreputable,--\"\n\n\"The daughter is not therefore disreputable. Her position is not\nchanged.\"\n\n\"I have to think of my friends.\"\n\n\"You should have thought of that before you declared yourself to her,\nMr. Neville.\" How true this was now, the young man knew better than\nthe priest, but that, as yet, was his own secret. \"You do not mean to\ntell me that because the father is not all that he should be, she is\ntherefore to be thrown over. That cannot be your idea of honour. Have\nyou not promised that you would make her your wife?\" The priest stopped\nfor an answer, but the young man made him none. \"Of course you have\npromised her.\"\n\n\"I suppose she has told you so.\"\n\n\"To whom should she tell her story? To whom should she go for advice?\nBut it was you who told me so, yourself.\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Did you not swear to me that you would not injure her? And why should\nthere have been any talk with you and me about her, but that I saw\nwhat was coming? When a young man like you chooses to spend his hours\nday after day and week after week with such a one as she is, with a\nbeautiful young girl, a sweet innocent young lady, so sweet as to make\neven an ould priest like me feel that the very atmosphere she breathes\nis perfumed and hallowed, must it not mean one of two things;--that he\ndesires to make her his wife or else,--or else something so vile that\nI will not name it in connection with Kate O'Hara? Then as her mother's\nfriend, and as hers,--as their only friend near them, I spoke out\nplainly to you, and you swore to me that you intended no harm to her.\"\n\n\"I would not harm her for the world.\"\n\n\"When you said that, you told me as plainly as you could spake that she\nshould be your wife. With her own mouth she never told me. Her mother\nhas told me. Daily Mrs. O'Hara has spoken to me of her hopes and fears.\nBy the Lord above me whom I worship, and by His Son in whom I rest all\nmy hopes, I would not stand in your shoes if you intend to tell that\nwoman that after all that has passed you mean to desert her child.\"\n\n\"Who has talked of deserting?\" asked Neville angrily.\n\n\"Say that you will be true to her, that you will make her your wife\nbefore God and man, and I will humbly ask your pardon.\"\n\n\"All that I say is that this Captain O'Hara's coming is a nuisance.\"\n\n\"If that be all, there is an end of it. It is a nuisance. Not that I\nsuppose he ever will come. If he persists she must send him a little\nmoney. There shall be no difficulty about that. She will never ask you\nto supply the means of keeping her husband.\"\n\n\"It isn't the money. I think you hardly understand my position, Father\nMarty.\" It seemed to Neville that if it was ever his intention to open\nout his scheme to the priest, now was his time for doing so. They had\ncome to the cross roads at which one way led down to the village and to\nFather Marty's house, and the other to the spot on the beach where the\nboat would be waiting. \"I can't very well go on to Liscannor,\" said\nNeville.\n\n\"Give me your word before we part that you will keep your promise to\nMiss O'Hara,\" said the priest.\n\n\"If you will step on a few yards with me I will tell you just how I am\nsituated.\" Then the priest assented, and they both went on towards the\nbeach, walking very slowly. \"If I alone were concerned, I would give\nup everything for Miss O'Hara. I am willing to give up everything as\nregards myself. I love her so dearly that she is more to me than all the\nhonours and wealth that are to come to me when my uncle dies.\"\n\n\"What is to hinder but that you should have the girl you love and your\nuncle's honours and wealth into the bargain?\"\n\n\"That is just it.\"\n\n\"By the life of me I don't see any difficulty. You're your own masther.\nThe ould Earl can't disinherit you if he would.\"\n\n\"But I am bound down.\"\n\n\"How bound? Who can bind you?\"\n\n\"I am bound not to make Miss O'Hara Countess of Scroope.\"\n\n\"What binds you? You are bound by a hundred promises to make her your\nwife.\"\n\n\"I have taken an oath that no Roman Catholic shall become Countess\nScroope as my wife.\"\n\n\"Then, Mr. Neville, let me tell you that you must break your oath.\"\n\n\"Would you have me perjure myself?\"\n\n\"Faith I would. Perjure yourself one way you certainly must, av' you've\ntaken such an oath as that, for you've sworn many oaths that you would\nmake this Catholic lady your wife. Not make a Roman Catholic Countess of\nScroope! It's the impudence of some of you Prothestants that kills me\nentirely. As though we couldn't count Countesses against you and beat\nyou by chalks! I ain't the man to call hard names, Mr. Neville; but if\none of us is upstarts, it's aisy seeing which. Your uncle's an ould man,\nand I'm told nigh to his latter end. I'm not saying but what you should\nrespect even his wakeness. But you'll not look me in the face and tell\nme that afther what's come and gone that young lady is to be cast on one\nside like a plucked rose, because an ould man has spoken a foolish word,\nor because a young man has made a wicked promise.\"\n\nThey were now standing again, and Fred raised his hat and rubbed his\nforehead as he endeavoured to arrange the words in which he could best\npropose his scheme to the priest. He had not yet escaped from the idea\nthat because Father Marty was a Roman Catholic priest, living in a\nvillage in the extreme west of Ireland, listening night and day to the\nroll of the Atlantic and drinking whisky punch, therefore he would be\nfound to be romantic, semi-barbarous, and perhaps more than semi-lawless\nin his views of life. Irish priests have been made by chroniclers of\nIrish story to do marvellous things; and Fred Neville thought that\nthis priest, if only the matter could be properly introduced, might\nbe persuaded to do for him something romantic, something marvellous,\nperhaps something almost lawless. In truth it might have been difficult\nto find a man more practical or more honest than Mr. Marty. And then\nthe difficulty of introducing the subject was very great. Neville stood\nwith his face a little averted, rubbing his forehead as he raised his\nsailor's hat. \"If you could only read my heart,\" he said, \"you'd know\nthat I am as true as steel.\"\n\n\"I'd be lothe to doubt it, Mr. Neville.\"\n\n\"I'd give up everything to call Kate my own.\"\n\n\"But you need give up nothing, and yet have her all your own.\"\n\n\"You say that because you don't completely understand. It may as well be\ntaken for granted at once that she can never be Countess of Scroope.\"\n\n\"Taken for granted!\" said the old man as the fire flashed out of his\neyes.\n\n\"Just listen to me for one moment. I will marry her to-morrow, or at any\ntime you may fix, if a marriage can be so arranged that she shall never\nbe more than Mrs. Neville.\"\n\n\"And what would you be?\"\n\n\"Mr. Neville.\"\n\n\"And what would her son be?\"\n\n\"Oh;--just the same,--when he grew up. Perhaps there wouldn't be a son.\"\n\n\"God forbid that there should on those terms. You intend that your\nchildren and her children shall be--bastards. That's about it, Mr.\nNeville.\" The romance seemed to vanish when the matter was submitted\nto him in this very prosaic manner. \"As to what you might choose to\ncall yourself, that would be nothing to me and not very much I should\nsay, to her. I believe a man needn't be a lord unless he likes to be a\nlord;--and needn't call his wife a countess. But, Mr. Neville, when you\nhave married Miss O'Hara, and when your uncle shall have died, there can\nbe no other Countess of Scroope, and her child must be the heir to your\nuncle's title.\"\n\n\"All that I could give her except that, she should have.\"\n\n\"But she must have that. She must be your wife before God and man, and\nher children must be the children of honour and not of disgrace.\"\nAh,--if the priest had known it all!\n\n\"I would live abroad with her, and her mother should live with us.\"\n\n\"You mean that you would take Kate O'Hara as your misthress! And you\nmake this as a proposal to me! Upon my word, Mr. Neville, I don't think\nthat I quite understand what it is that you're maning to say to me. Is\nshe to be your wife?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Neville, urged by the perturbation of his spirit to give a\nstronger assurance than he had intended.\n\n\"Then must her son if she have one be the future Earl of Scroope. He may\nbe Protesthant,--or what you will?\"\n\n\"You don't understand me, Father Marty.\"\n\n\"Faith, and that's thrue. But we are at the baich, Mr. Neville, and I've\ntwo miles along the coast to Liscannor.\"\n\n\"Shall I make Barney take you round in the canoe?\"\n\n\"I believe I may as well walk it. Good-bye, Mr. Neville. I'm glad at any\nrate to hear you say so distinctly that you are resolved at all hazards\nto make that dear girl your wife.\" This he said, almost in a whisper,\nstanding close to the boat, with his hand on Neville's shoulder. He\npaused a moment as though to give special strength to his words, and\nNeville did not dare or was not able to protest against the assertion.\nFather Marty himself was certainly not romantic in his manner of\nmanaging such an affair as this in which they were now both concerned.\n\nNeville went back to Ennis much depressed, turning the matter over in\nhis mind almost hopelessly. This was what had come from his adventures!\nNo doubt he might marry the girl,--postponing his marriage till after\nhis uncle's death. For aught he knew as yet that might still be\npossible. But were he to do so, he would disgrace his family, and\ndisgrace himself by breaking the solemn promise he had made. And in such\ncase he would be encumbered, and possibly be put beyond the pale of that\nsort of life which should be his as Earl of Scroope, by having Captain\nO'Hara as his father-in-law. He was aware now that he would be held by\nall his natural friends to have ruined himself by such a marriage.\n\nOn the other hand he could, no doubt, throw the girl over. They could\nnot make him marry her though they could probably make him pay very\ndearly for not doing so. If he could only harden his heart sufficiently\nhe could escape in that way. But he was not hard, and he did feel that\nso escaping, he would have a load on his breast which would make his\nlife unendurable. Already he was beginning to hate the coast of Ireland,\nand to think that the gloom of Scroope Manor was preferable to it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nFRED NEVILLE RECEIVES A VISITOR AT ENNIS.\n\n\nFor something over three weeks after his walk with the priest Neville\nsaw neither of the two ladies of Ardkill. Letters were frequent between\nthe cottage and the barracks at Ennis, but,--so said Fred himself,\nmilitary duties detained him with the troop. He explained that he had\nbeen absent a great deal, and that now Captain Johnstone was taking his\nshare of ease. He was all alone at the barracks, and could not get away.\nThere was some truth in this, created perhaps by the fact that as he\ndidn't stir, Johnstone could do so. Johnstone was backwards and forwards,\nfishing at Castle Connel, and Neville was very exact in explaining that\nfor the present he was obliged to give up all the delights of the coast.\nBut the days were days of trial to him.\n\nA short history of the life of Captain O'Hara was absolutely sent to\nhim by the Countess of Scroope. The family lawyer, at the instance of\nthe Earl,--as she said, though probably her own interference had been\nmore energetic than that of the Earl,--had caused enquiries to be made.\nCaptain O'Hara, the husband of the lady who was now living on the coast\nof County Clare, and who was undoubtedly the father of the Miss O'Hara\nwhom Fred knew, had passed at least ten of the latter years of his\nlife at the galleys in the south of France. He had been engaged in\nan extensive swindling transaction at Bordeaux, and had thence been\ntransferred to Toulon, had there been maintained by France,--and was now\nin London. The Countess in sending this interesting story to her nephew\nat Ennis, with ample documentary evidence, said that she was sure that\nhe would not degrade his family utterly by thinking of allying himself\nwith people who were so thoroughly disreputable; but that, after all\nthat was passed, his uncle expected from him a renewed assurance on the\nmatter. He answered this in anger. He did not understand why the history\nof Captain O'Hara should have been raked up. Captain O'Hara was nothing\nto him. He supposed it had come from Castle Quin, and anything from\nCastle Quin he disbelieved. He had given a promise once and he didn't\nunderstand why he should be asked for any further assurance. He\nthought it very hard that his life should be made a burden to him by\nfoul-mouthed rumours from Castle Quin. That was the tenour of his letter\nto his aunt; but even that letter sufficed to make it almost certain\nthat he could never marry the girl. He acknowledged that he had bound\nhimself not to do so. And then, in spite of all that he said about the\nmendacity of Castle Quin, he did believe the little history. And it\nwas quite out of the question that he should marry the daughter of a\nreturned galley-slave. He did not think that any jury in England would\nhold him to be bound by such a promise. Of course he would do whatever\nhe could for his dear Kate; but, even after all that had passed, he\ncould not pollute himself by marriage with the child of so vile a\nfather. Poor Kate! Her sufferings would have been occasioned not by him,\nbut by her father.\n\nIn the meantime Kate's letters to him became more and more frequent,\nmore and more sad,--filled ever with still increasing warmth of\nentreaty. At last they came by every post, though he knew how difficult\nit must be for her to find daily messengers into Ennistimon. Would he\nnot come and see her? He must come and see her. She was ill and would\ndie unless he came to her. He did not always answer these letters, but\nhe did write to her perhaps twice a week. He would come very soon,--as\nsoon as Johnstone had come back from his fishing. She was not to fret\nherself. Of course he could not always be at Ardkill. He too had things\nto trouble him. Then he told her he had received letters from home which\ncaused him very much trouble; and there was a something of sharpness\nin his words, which brought from her a string of lamentations in\nwhich, however, the tears and wailings did not as yet take the form\nof reproaches. Then there came a short note from Mrs. O'Hara herself.\n\"I must beg that you will come to Ardkill at once. It is absolutely\nnecessary for Kate's safety that you should do so.\"\n\nWhen he received this he thought that he would go on the morrow. When\nthe morrow came he determined to postpone the journey another day! The\ncalls of duty are so much less imperious than those of pleasure! On that\nfurther day he still meant to go, as he sat about noon unbraced, only\npartly dressed in his room at the barracks. His friend Johnstone was back\nin Ennis, and there was also a Cornet with the troop. He had no excuse\nwhatever on the score of military duty for remaining at home on that\nday. But he sat idling his time, thinking of things. All the charm of\nthe adventure was gone. He was sick of the canoe and of Barney Morony.\nHe did not care a straw for the seals or wild gulls. The moaning of the\nocean beneath the cliff was no longer pleasurable to him,--and as to the\nmoaning at their summit, to tell the truth, he was afraid of it. The\nlong drive thither and back was tedious to him. He thought now more of\nthe respectability of his family than of the beauty of Kate O'Hara.\n\nBut still he meant to go,--certainly would go on this very day. He had\ndesired that his gig should be ready, and had sent word to say that he\nmight start at any moment. But still he sat in his dressing-gown at\nnoon, unbraced, with a novel in his hand which he could not read, and a\npipe by his side which he could not smoke. Close to him on the table lay\nthat record of the life of Captain O'Hara, which his aunt had sent him,\nevery word of which he had now examined for the third or fourth time. Of\ncourse he could not marry the girl. Mrs. O'Hara had deceived him. She\ncould not but have known that her husband was a convict;--and had kept\nthe knowledge back from him in order that she might allure him to the\nmarriage. Anything that money could do, he would do. Or, if they would\nconsent, he would take the girl away with him to some sunny distant\nclime, in which adventures might still be sweet, and would then devote\nto her--some portion of his time. He had not yet ruined himself, but\nhe would indeed ruin himself were he, the heir to the earldom of\nScroope, to marry the daughter of a man who had been at the French\ngalleys! He had just made up his mind that he would be firm in this\nresolution,--when the door opened and Mrs. O'Hara entered his room.\n\"Mrs. O'Hara.\"\n\nShe closed the door carefully behind her before she spoke, excluding the\nmilitary servant who had wished to bar her entrance. \"Yes, sir; as you\nwould not come to us I have been forced to come to you. I know it all.\nWhen will you make my child your wife?\"\n\nYes. In the abjectness of her misery the poor girl had told her mother\nthe story of her disgrace; or, rather, in her weakness had suffered her\nsecret to fall from her lips. That terrible retribution was to come upon\nher which, when sin has been mutual, falls with so crushing a weight\nupon her who of the two sinners has ever been by far the less sinful.\nShe, when she knew her doom, simply found herself bound by still\nstronger ties of love to him who had so cruelly injured her. She was his\nbefore; but now she was more than ever his. To have him near her, to\ngive her orders that she might obey them, was the consolation that she\ncoveted,--the only consolation that could have availed anything to her.\nTo lean against him, and to whisper to him, with face averted, with\nhalf-formed syllables, some fervent words that might convey to him a\ntruth which might be almost a joy to her if he would make it so,--was\nthe one thing that could restore hope to her bosom. Let him come and be\nnear to her, so that she might hide her face upon his breast. But he\ncame not. He did not come, though, as best she knew how, she had thrown\nall her heart into her letters. Then her spirit sank within her, and she\nsickened, and as her mother knelt over her, she allowed her secret to\nfall from her.\n\nFred Neville's sitting-room at Ennis was not a chamber prepared for the\nreception of ladies. It was very rough, as are usually barrack rooms in\noutlying quarters in small towns in the west of Ireland,--and it was\nalso very untidy. The more prudent and orderly of mankind might hardly\nhave understood why a young man, with prospects and present wealth such\nas belonged to Neville, should choose to spend a twelvemonth in such a\nroom, contrary to the wishes of all his friends, when London was open\nto him, and the continent, and scores of the best appointed houses in\nEngland, and all the glories of ownership at Scroope. There were guns\nabout, and whips, hardly half a dozen books, and a few papers. There\nwere a couple of swords lying on a table that looked like a dresser. The\nroom was not above half covered with its carpet, and though there were\nthree large easy chairs, even they were torn and soiled. But all this\nhad been compatible with adventures,--and while the adventures were\nsimply romantic and not a bit troublesome, the barracks at Ennis had\nbeen to him by far preferable to the gloomy grandeur of Scroope.\n\nAnd now Mrs. O'Hara was there, telling him that she knew of all! Not for\na moment did he remain ignorant of the meaning of her communication. And\nnow the arguments to be used against him in reference to the marriage\nwould be stronger than ever. A silly, painful smile came across his\nhandsome face as he attempted to welcome her, and moved a chair for her\naccommodation. \"I am so sorry that you have had the trouble of coming\nover,\" he said.\n\n\"That is nothing. When will you make my child your wife?\" How was he to\nanswer this? In the midst of his difficulties he had brought himself to\none determination. He had resolved that under no pressure would he marry\nthe daughter of O'Hara, the galley-slave. As far as that, he had seen\nhis way. Should he now at once speak of the galley-slave, and, with\nexpressions of regret, decline the alliance on that reason? Having\ndishonoured this woman's daughter should he shelter himself behind the\ndishonour of her husband? That he meant to do so ultimately is true;\nbut at the present moment such a task would have required a harder\nheart than his. She rose from her chair and stood close over him as she\nrepeated her demand, \"When will you make my child your wife?\"\n\n\"You do not want me to answer you at this moment?\"\n\n\"Yes;--at this moment. Why not answer me at once? She has told me all.\nMr. Neville, you must think not only of her, but of your child also.\"\n\n\"I hope not that,\" he said.\n\n\"I tell you that it is so. Now answer me. When shall my Kate become your\nwife?\"\n\nHe still knew that any such consummation as that was quite out of the\nquestion. The mother herself as she was now present to him, seemed to\nbe a woman very different from the quiet, handsome, high-spirited, but\nlow-voiced widow whom he had known, or thought that he had known, at\nArdkill. Of her as she had there appeared to him he had not been ashamed\nto think as one who might at some future time be personally related to\nhimself. He had recognized her as a lady whose outward trappings, poor\nthough they might be, were suited to the seclusion in which she lived.\nBut now, although it was only to Ennis that she had come from her nest\namong the rocks, she seemed to be unfitted for even so much intercourse\nwith the world as that. And in the demand which she reiterated over him\nshe hardly spoke as a lady would speak. Would not all they who were\nconnected with him at home have a right to complain if he were to bring\nsuch a woman with him to England as the mother of his wife. \"I can't\nanswer such a question as that on the spur of the moment,\" he said.\n\n\"You will not dare to tell me that you mean to desert her?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I was coming over to Ardkill this very day. The trap is\nordered. I hope Kate is well?\"\n\n\"She is not well. How should she be well?\"\n\n\"Why not? I didn't know. If there is anything that she wants that I can\nget for her, you have only to speak.\"\n\nIn the utter contempt which Mrs. O'Hara now felt for the man she\nprobably forgot that his immediate situation was one in which it was\nnearly impossible that any man should conduct himself with dignity.\nHaving brought himself to his present pass by misconduct, he could\ndiscover no line of good conduct now open to him. Moralists might tell\nhim that let the girl's parentage be what it might, he ought to marry\nher; but he was stopped from that, not only by his oath, but by a\nconviction that his highest duty required him to preserve his family\nfrom degradation. And yet to a mother, with such a demand on her lips\nas that now made by Mrs. O'Hara,--whose demand was backed by such\ncircumstances,--how was it possible that he should tell the truth and\nplead the honour of his family? His condition was so cruel that it was\nno longer possible to him to be dignified or even true. The mother again\nmade her demand. \"There is one thing that you must do for her before\nother things can be thought of. When shall she become your wife?\"\n\nIt was for a moment on his tongue to tell her that it could not be so\nwhile his uncle lived;--but to this he at once felt that there were two\nobjections, directly opposed to each other, but each so strong as to\nmake any such reply very dangerous. It would imply a promise, which he\ncertainly did not intend to keep, of marrying the girl when his uncle\nshould be dead; and, although promising so much more than he intended\nto perform, would raise the ungovernable wrath of the woman before him.\nThat he should now hesitate,--now, in her Kate's present condition,--as\nto redeeming those vows of marriage which he had made to her in her\ninnocence, would raise a fury in the mother's bosom which he feared to\nencounter. He got up and walked about the room, while she stood with her\neyes fixed upon him, ever and anon reiterating her demand. \"No day must\nnow be lost. When will you make my child your wife?\"\n\nAt last he made a proposition to which she assented. The tidings\nwhich she had brought him had come upon him very suddenly. He was\ninexpressibly pained. Of course Kate, his dearest Kate, was everything\nto him. Let him have that afternoon to think about it. On the morrow he\nwould assuredly visit Ardkill. The mother, full of fears, resolving that\nshould he attempt to play her girl false and escape from her she would\nfollow him to the end of the world, but feeling that at the present\nmoment she could not constrain him, accepted his repeated promise as to\nthe following day; and at last left him to himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nNEVILLE'S SUCCESS.\n\n\nNeville sat in his room alone, without moving, for a couple of hours\nafter Mrs. O'Hara had left him. In what way should he escape from the\nmisery and ruin which seemed to surround him? An idea did cross his\nmind that it would be better for him to fly and write the truth from\nthe comparatively safe distance of his London club. But there would\nbe a meanness in such conduct which would make it impossible that he\nshould ever again hold up his head. The girl had trusted to him, and by\ntrusting to him had brought herself to this miserable pass. He could\nnot desert her. It would be better that he should go and endure all\nthe vials of their wrath than that. To her he would still be tenderly\nloving, if she would accept his love without the name which he could not\ngive her. His whole life he would sacrifice to her. Every luxury which\nmoney could purchase he would lavish on her. He must go and make his\noffer. The vials of wrath which would doubtless be poured out upon his\nhead would not come from her. In his heart of hearts he feared both\nthe priest and the mother. But there are moments in which a man feels\nhimself obliged to encounter all that he most fears;--and the man who\ndoes not do so in such moments is a coward.\n\nHe quite made up his mind to start early on the following morning; but\nthe intermediate hours were very sad and heavy, and his whole outlook\ninto life was troublesome to him. How infinitely better would it have\nbeen for him had he allowed himself to be taught a twelvemonth since\nthat his duty required him to give up the army at once! But he had made\nhis bed, and now he must lie upon it. There was no escape from this\njourney to Ardkill. Even though he should be stunned by their wrath he\nmust endure it.\n\nHe breakfasted early the next day, and got into his gig before nine.\nHe must face the enemy, and the earlier that he did it the better. His\ndifficulty now lay in arranging the proposition that he would make and\nthe words that he should speak. Every difficulty would be smoothed and\nevery danger dispelled if he would only say that he would marry the girl\nas quickly as the legal forms would allow. Father Marty, he knew, would\nsee to all that, and the marriage might be done effectually. He had\nquite come to understand that Father Marty was practical rather than\nromantic. But there would be cowardice in this as mean as that other\ncowardice. He believed himself to be bound by his duty to his family.\nWere he now to renew his promise of marriage, such renewal would be\ncaused by fear and not by duty, and would be mean. They should tear him\npiecemeal rather than get from him such a promise. Then he thought of\nthe Captain, and perceived that he must make all possible use of the\nCaptain's character. Would anybody conceive that he, the heir of the\nScroope family, was bound to marry the daughter of a convict returned\nfrom the galleys? And was it not true that such promise as he had made\nhad been obtained under false pretences? Why had he not been told of the\nCaptain's position when he first made himself intimate with the mother\nand daughter?\n\nInstead of going as was his custom to Lahinch, and then rowing across\nthe bay and round the point, he drove his gig to the village of\nLiscannor. He was sick of Barney Morony and the canoe, and never desired\nto see either of them again. He was sick indeed, of everything Irish,\nand thought that the whole island was a mistake. He drove however boldly\nthrough Liscannor and up to Father Marty's yard, and, not finding the\npriest at home, there left his horse and gig. He had determined that\nhe would first go to the priest and boldly declare that nothing should\ninduce him to marry the daughter of a convict. But Father Marty was not\nat home. The old woman who kept his house believed that he had gone into\nEnnistown. He was away with his horse, and would not be back till dinner\ntime. Then Neville, having seen his own nag taken from the gig, started\non his walk up to Ardkill.\n\nHow ugly the country was to his eyes as he now saw it. Here and there\nstood a mud cabin, and the small, half-cultivated fields, or rather\npatches of land, in which the thin oat crops were beginning to be\ngreen, were surrounded by low loose ramshackle walls, which were little\nmore than heaps of stone, so carelessly had they been built and so\nnegligently preserved. A few cocks and hens with here and there a\nmiserable, starved pig seemed to be the stock of the country. Not a\ntree, not a shrub, not a flower was there to be seen. The road was\nnarrow, rough, and unused. The burial ground which he passed was the\nliveliest sign of humanity about the place. Then the country became\nstill wilder, and there was no road. The oats also ceased, and the\nwalls. But he could hear the melancholy moan of the waves, which he had\nonce thought to be musical and had often sworn that he loved. Now the\nplace with all its attributes was hideous to him, distasteful, and\nabominable. At last the cottage was in view, and his heart sank very\nlow. Poor Kate! He loved her dearly through it all. He endeavoured to\ntake comfort by assuring himself that his heart was true to her. Not for\nworlds would he injure her;--that is, not for worlds, had any worlds\nbeen exclusively his own. On account of the Scroope world,--which was a\nworld general rather than particular,--no doubt he must injure her most\nhorribly. But still she was his dear Kate, his own Kate, his Kate whom\nhe would never desert.\n\nWhen he came up to the cottage the little gate was open, and he knew\nthat somebody was there besides the usual inmates. His heart at once\ntold him that it was the priest. His fate had brought him face to face\nwith his two enemies at once! His breath almost left him, but he knew\nthat he could not run away. However bitter might be the vials of wrath\nhe must encounter them. So he knocked at the outer door and, after his\ncustom, walked into the passage. Then he knocked again at the door of\nthe one sitting-room,--the door which hitherto he had always passed with\nthe conviction that he should bring delight,--and for a moment there was\nno answer. He heard no voice and he knocked again. The door was opened\nfor him, and as he entered he met Father Marty. But he at once saw that\nthere was another man in the room, seated in an arm chair near the\nwindow. Kate, his Kate, was not there, but Mrs. O'Hara was standing at\nthe head of the sofa, far away from the window and close to the door.\n\"It is Mr. Neville,\" said the priest. \"It is as well that he should come\nin.\"\n\n\"Mr. Neville,\" said the man rising from his chair, \"I am informed that\nyou are a suitor for the hand of my daughter. Your prospects in life are\nsufficient, sir, and I give my consent.\"\n\nThe man was a thing horrible to look at, tall, thin, cadaverous,\nill-clothed, with his wretched and all but ragged overcoat buttoned\nclose up to his chin, with long straggling thin grizzled hair,\nred-nosed, with a drunkard's eyes, and thin lips drawn down at the\ncorners of the mouth. This was Captain O'Hara; and if any man ever\nlooked like a convict returned from work in chains, such was the\nappearance of this man. This was the father of Fred's Kate;--the man\nwhom it was expected that he, Frederic Neville, the future Earl of\nScroope, should take as his father-in-law! \"This is Captain O'Hara,\"\nsaid the priest. But even Father Marty, bold as he was, could not assume\nthe voice with which he had rebuked Neville as he walked with him, now\nnearly a month ago, down to the beach.\n\nNeville did feel that the abomination of the man's appearance\nstrengthened his position. He stood looking from one to another, while\nMrs. O'Hara remained silent in the corner. \"Perhaps,\" said he, \"I had\nbetter not be here. I am intruding.\"\n\n\"It is right that you should know it all,\" said the priest. \"As regards\nthe young lady it cannot now alter your position. This gentleman must\nbe--arranged for.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said the Captain. \"I must be--arranged for, and that so\nsoon as possible.\" The man spoke with a slightly foreign accent and in\na tone, as Fred thought, which savoured altogether of the galleys. \"You\nhave done me the honour, I am informed, to make my daughter all your\nown. These estimable people assure me that you hasten to make her your\nwife on the instant. I consent. The O'Haras, who are of the very oldest\nblood in Europe, have always connected themselves highly. Your uncle\nis a most excellent nobleman whose hand I shall be proud to grasp.\" As\nhe thus spoke he stalked across the room to Fred, intending at once to\ncommence the work of grasping the Neville family.\n\n\"Get back,\" said Fred, retreating to the door.\n\n\"Is it that you fail to believe that I am your bride's father?\"\n\n\"I know not whose father you may be. Get back.\"\n\n\"He is what he says he is,\" said the priest. \"You should bear with him\nfor a while.\"\n\n\"Where is Kate?\" demanded Fred. It seemed as though, for the moment,\nhe were full of courage. He looked round at Mrs. O'Hara, but nobody\nanswered him. She was still standing with her eyes fixed upon the\nman, almost as though she thought that she could dart out upon him and\ndestroy him. \"Where is Kate?\" he asked again. \"Is she well?\"\n\n\"Well enough to hide herself from her old father,\" said the Captain,\nbrushing a tear from his eye with the back of his hand.\n\n\"You shall see her presently, Mr. Neville,\" said the priest.\n\nThen Neville whispered a word into the priest's ear. \"What is it that\nthe man wants?\"\n\n\"You need not regard that,\" said Father Marty.\n\n\"Mr. Marty,\" said the Captain, \"you concern yourself too closely in my\naffairs. I prefer to open my thoughts and desires to my son-in-law. He\nhas taken measures which give him a right to interfere in the family.\nHa, ha, ha.\"\n\n\"If you talk like that I'll stab you to the heart,\" said Mrs. O'Hara,\njumping forward. Then Fred Neville perceived that the woman had a dagger\nin her hand which she had hitherto concealed from him as she stood up\nagainst the wall behind the head of the sofa. He learnt afterwards that\nthe priest, having heard in Liscannor of the man's arrival, had hurried\nup to the cottage, reaching it almost at the same moment with the\nCaptain. Kate had luckily at the moment been in her room and had not\nseen her father. She was still in her bed and was ill;--but during the\nscene that occurred afterwards she roused herself. But Mrs. O'Hara,\neven in the priest's presence, had at once seized the weapon from the\ndrawer,--showing that she was prepared even for murder, had murder been\nfound necessary by her for her relief. The man had immediately asked as\nto the condition of his daughter, and the mother had learned that her\nchild's secret was known to all Liscannor. The priest now laid his hand\nupon her and stopped her, but he did it in all gentleness. \"You'll have\na fierce pig of a mother-in-law, Mr. Neville,\" said the Captain, \"but\nyour wife's father,--you'll find him always gentle and open to reason.\nYou were asking what I wanted.\"\n\n\"Had I not better give him money?\" suggested Neville.\n\n\"No,\" said the priest shaking his head.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Captain O'Hara.\n\n\"If you will leave this place at once,\" said Neville, \"and come to me\nto-morrow morning at the Ennis barracks, I will give you money.\"\n\n\"Give him none,\" said Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\"My beloved is unreasonable. You would not be rid of me even were he to\nbe so hard. I should not die. Have I not proved to you that I am one\nwhom it is hard to destroy by privation. The family has been under a\ncloud. A day of sunshine has come with this gallant young nobleman. Let\nme partake the warmth. I will visit you, Mr. Neville, certainly;--but\nwhat shall be the figure?\"\n\n\"That will be as I shall find you then.\"\n\n\"I will trust you. I will come. The journey hence to Ennis is long for\none old as I am, and would be lightened by so small a trifle as--shall\nI say a bank note of the meanest value.\" Upon this Neville handed him\ntwo bank notes for \u00c2\u00a31 each, and Captain O'Hara walked forth out of his\nwife's house.\n\n\"He will never leave you now,\" said the priest.\n\n\"He cannot hurt me. I will arrange with some man of business to pay him\na stipend as long as he never troubles our friend here. Though all the\nworld should know it, will it not be better so?\"\n\nGreat and terrible is the power of money. When this easy way out of\ntheir immediate difficulties had been made by the rich man, even\nMrs. O'Hara with all her spirit was subdued for the moment, and the\nreproaches of the priest were silenced for that hour. The young man\nhad seemed to behave well, had stood up as the friend of the suffering\nwomen, and had been at any rate ready with his money. \"And now,\" he\nsaid, \"where is Kate?\" Then Mrs. O'Hara took him by the hand and led\nhim into the bedroom in which the poor girl had buried herself from her\nfather's embrace. \"Is he gone?\" she asked before even she would throw\nherself into her lover's arms.\n\n\"Neville has paid him money,\" said the mother.\n\n\"Yes, he has gone,\" said Fred; \"and I think,--I think that he will\ntrouble you no more.\"\n\n\"Oh, Fred, oh, my darling, oh, my own one. At last, at last you have\ncome to me. Why have you stayed away? You will not stay away again? Oh,\nFred, you do love me? Say that you love me.\"\n\n\"Better than all the world,\" he said pressing her to his bosom.\n\nHe remained with her for a couple of hours, during which hardly a word\nwas said to him about his marriage. So great had been the effect upon\nthem all of the sudden presence of the Captain, and so excellent had\nbeen the service rendered them by the trust which the Captain had placed\nin the young man's wealth, that for this day both priest and mother were\nincapacitated from making their claim with the vigour and intensity of\npurpose which they would have shewn had Captain O'Hara not presented\nhimself at the cottage. The priest left them soon,--but not till it had\nbeen arranged that Neville should go back to Ennis to prepare for his\nreception of the Captain, and return to the cottage on the day after\nthat interview was over. He assumed on a sudden the practical views of\na man of business. He would take care to have an Ennis attorney with\nhim when speaking to the Captain, and would be quite prepared to go to\nthe extent of two hundred a year for the Captain's life, if the Captain\ncould be safely purchased for that money. \"A quarter of it would do,\"\nsaid Mrs. O'Hara. The priest thought \u00c2\u00a32 a week would be ample. \"I'll be\nas good as my word,\" said Fred. Kate sat looking into his face thinking\nthat he was still a god.\n\n\"And you will certainly be here by noon on Sunday?\" said Kate, clinging\nto him when he rose to go.\n\n\"Most certainly.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear Fred.\" And so he walked down the hill to the priest's house\nalmost triumphantly. He thought himself fortunate in not finding the\npriest who had ridden off from Ardkill to some distant part of the\nparish;--and then drove himself back to Ennis.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nFRED NEVILLE IS AGAIN CALLED HOME TO SCROOPE.\n\n\nNeville was intent upon business, and had not been back in Ennis from\nthe cottage half an hour before he obtained an introduction to an\nattorney. He procured it through the sergeant-major of the troop. The\nsergeant-major was intimate with the innkeeper, and the innkeeper was\nable to say that Mr. Thaddeus Crowe was an honest, intelligent, and\npeculiarly successful lawyer. Before he sat down to dinner Fred Neville\nwas closeted at the barracks with Mr. Crowe.\n\nHe began by explaining to Mr. Crowe who he was. This he did in order\nthat the attorney might know that he had the means of carrying out his\npurpose. Mr. Crowe bowed, and assured his client that on that score he\nhad no doubts whatever. Nevertheless Mr. Crowe's first resolve, when he\nheard of the earldom and of the golden prospects, was to be very careful\nnot to pay any money out of his own pocket on behalf of the young\nofficer, till he made himself quite sure that it would be returned to\nhim with interest. As the interview progressed, however, Mr. Crowe began\nto see his way, and to understand that the golden prospects were not\npleaded because the owner of them was himself short of cash. Mr. Crowe\nsoon understood the whole story. He had heard of Captain O'Hara, and\nbelieved the man to be as thorough a blackguard as ever lived. When\nNeville told the attorney of the two ladies, and of the anxiety which he\nfelt to screen them from the terrible annoyance of the Captain's visits,\nMr. Crowe smiled, but made no remark. \"It will be enough for you to know\nthat I am in earnest about it,\" said the future Earl, resenting even the\nsmile. Mr. Crowe bowed, and asked his client to finish the story. \"The\nman is to be with me to-morrow, here, at twelve, and I wish you to be\npresent. Mr. Crowe, my intention is to give him two hundred pounds a\nyear as long as he lives.\"\n\n\"Two hundred a year!\" said the Ennis attorney, to whom such an annuity\nseemed to be exorbitant as the purchase-money for a returned convict.\n\n\"Yes;--I have already mentioned that sum to his wife, though not to\nhim.\"\n\n\"I should reconsider it, Mr. Neville.\"\n\n\"Thank you;--but I have made up my mind. The payments will be made of\ncourse only on condition that he troubles neither of the ladies either\npersonally or by letter. It might be provided that it shall be paid to\nhim weekly in France, but will not be paid should he leave that country.\nYou will think of all this, and will make suggestions to-morrow. I shall\nbe glad to have the whole thing left in your hands, so that I need\nsimply remit the cheques to you. Perhaps I shall have the pleasure of\nseeing you to-morrow at twelve.\" Mr. Crowe promised to turn the matter\nover in his mind and to be present at the hour named. Neville carried\nhimself very well through the interview, assuming with perfect ease the\nmanners of the great and rich man who had only to give his orders with a\ncertainty that they would be obeyed. Mr. Crowe, when he went out from\nthe young man's presence, had no longer any doubt on his mind as to his\nclient's pecuniary capability.\n\nOn the following day at twelve o'clock, Captain O'Hara, punctual to the\nminute, was at the barracks; and there also sitting in Neville's room,\nwas the attorney. But Neville himself was not there, and the Captain\nimmediately felt that he had been grossly imposed upon and swindled.\n\"And who may I have the honour of addressing, when I speak to you, sir?\"\ndemanded the Captain.\n\n\"I am a lawyer.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Neville,--my own son-in-law,--has played me that trick!\"\n\nMr. Crowe explained that no trick had been played, but did so in\nlanguage which was no doubt less courteous than would have been used had\nMr. Neville been present. As, however, the cause of our hero's absence\nis more important to us than the Captain's prospects that must be first\nexplained.\n\nAs soon as the attorney left him Neville had sat down to dinner with his\ntwo brother officers, but was not by any means an agreeable companion.\nWhen they attempted to joke with him as to the young lady on the\ncliffs, he showed very plainly that he did not like it; and when Cornet\nSimpkinson after dinner raised his glass to drink a health to Miss\nO'Hara, Mr. Neville told him that he was an impertinent ass. It was then\nsomewhat past nine, and it did not seem probable that the evening would\ngo off pleasantly. Cornet Simpkinson lit his cigar, and tried to wink\nat the Captain. Neville stretched out his legs and pretended to go to\nsleep. At this moment it was a matter of intense regret to him that he\nhad ever seen the West of Ireland.\n\nAt a little before ten Captain Johnstone retired, and the Cornet attempted\nan apology. He had not meant to say anything that Neville would not\nlike. \"It doesn't signify, my dear boy; only as a rule, never mention\nwomen's names,\" said Neville, speaking as though he were fully fitted by\nhis experience to lay down the law on a matter so delicate. \"Perhaps one\nhadn't better,\" said the Cornet,--and then that little difficulty was\nover. Cornet Simpkinson however thought of it all afterwards, and felt\nthat that evening and that hour had been more important than any other\nevening or any other hour in his life.\n\nAt half-past ten, when Neville was beginning to think that he would take\nhimself to bed, and was still cursing the evil star which had brought\nhim to County Clare, there arose a clatter at the outside gate of the\nsmall barrack-yard. A man had posted all the way down from Limerick and\ndesired to see Mr. Neville at once. The man had indeed come direct from\nScroope,--by rail from Dublin to Limerick, and thence without delay on\nto Ennis. The Earl of Scroope was dead, and Frederic Neville was Earl of\nScroope. The man brought a letter from Miss Mellerby, telling him the\nsad news and conjuring him in his aunt's name to come at once to the\nManor. Of course he must start at once for the Manor. Of course he must\nattend as first mourner at his uncle's grave before he could assume his\nuncle's name and fortune.\n\nIn that first hour of his greatness the shock to him was not so great\nbut that he at once thought of the O'Haras. He would leave Ennis the\nfollowing morning at six, so as to catch the day mail train out of\nLimerick for Dublin. That was a necessity; but though so very short a\nspan of time was left to him, he must still make arrangements about the\nO'Haras. He had hardly heard the news half an hour before he himself\nwas knocking at the door of Mr. Crowe the attorney. He was admitted,\nand Mr. Crowe descended to him in a pair of slippers and a very\nold dressing-gown. Mr. Crowe, as he held his tallow candle up to\nhis client's face, looked as if he didn't like it. \"I know I must\napologize,\" said Neville, \"but I have this moment received news of my\nuncle's death.\"\n\n\"The Earl?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And I have now the honour of--speaking to the Earl of Scroope.\"\n\n\"Never mind that. I must start for England almost immediately. I haven't\nabove an hour or two. You must see that man, O'Hara, without me.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my lord.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't speak to me in that way yet,\" said Neville angrily. \"You\nwill be good enough to understand that the terms are fixed;--two hundred\na year as long, as he remains in France and never molests anyone either\nby his presence or by letter. Thank you. I shall be so much obliged\nto you! I shall be back here after the funeral, and will arrange about\npayments. Good-night.\"\n\nSo it happened that Captain O'Hara had no opportunity on that occasion\nof seeing his proposed son-in-law. Mr. Crowe, fully crediting the power\nconfided to him, did as he was bidden. He was very harsh to the poor\nCaptain; but in such a condition a man can hardly expect that people\nshould not be harsh to him. The Captain endeavoured to hold up his head,\nand to swagger, and to assume an air of pinchbeck respectability. But\nthe attorney would not permit it. He required that the man should own\nhimself to be penniless, a scoundrel, only anxious to be bought; and\nthe Captain at last admitted the facts. The figure was the one thing\nimportant to him,--the figure and the nature of the assurance. Mr. Crowe\nhad made his calculations, and put the matter very plainly. A certain\nnumber of francs,--a hundred francs,--would be paid to him weekly at any\ntown in France he might select,--which however would be forfeited by any\nletter written either to Mrs. O'Hara, to Miss O'Hara, or to the Earl.\n\n\"The Earl!\" ejaculated the Captain.\n\nMr. Crowe had been unable to refrain his tongue from the delicious\ntitle, but now corrected himself. \"Nor Mr. Neville, I mean. No one will\nbe bound to give you a farthing, and any letter asking for anything more\nwill forfeit the allowance altogether.\" The Captain vainly endeavoured\nto make better terms, and of course accepted those proposed to him. He\nwould live in Paris,--dear Paris. He took five pounds for his journey,\nand named an agent for the transmission of his money.\n\nAnd so Fred Neville was the Earl of Scroope. He had still one other task\nto perform before he could make his journey home. He had to send tidings\nin some shape to Ardkill of what had happened. As he returned to the\nbarracks from Mr. Crowe's residence he thought wholly of this. That\nother matter was now arranged. As one item of the cost of his adventure\nin County Clare he must pay two hundred a year to that reprobate, the\nCaptain, as long as the reprobate chose to live,--and must also pay Mr.\nCrowe's bill for his assistance. This was a small matter to him as his\nwealth was now great, and he was not a man by nature much prone to think\nof money. Nevertheless it was a bad beginning of his life. Though he had\ndeclared himself to be quite indifferent on that head, he did feel that\nthe arrangement was not altogether reputable,--that it was one which\nhe could not explain to his own man of business without annoyance, and\nwhich might perhaps give him future trouble. Now he must prepare his\nmessage for the ladies at Ardkill,--especially to the lady whom on his\nlast visit to the cottage he had found armed with a dagger for the\nreception of her husband. And as he returned back to the barracks\nit occurred to him that a messenger might be better than a letter.\n\"Simpkinson,\" he said, going at once into the young man's bed-room,\n\"have you heard what has happened to me?\" Simpkinson had heard all about\nit, and expressed himself as \"deucedly sorry\" for the old man's death,\nbut seemed to think that there might be consolation for that sorrow. \"I\nmust go to Scroope immediately,\" said Neville. \"I have explained it all\nto Johnstone, and shall start almost at once. I shall first lie down and\nget an hour's sleep. I want you to do something for me.\" Simpkinson was\ndevoted. Simpkinson would do anything. \"I cut up a little rough just now\nwhen you mentioned Miss O'Hara's name.\" Simpkinson declared that he did\nnot mind it in the least, and would never pronounce the name again as\nlong as he lived. \"But I want you to go and see her to-morrow,\" said\nNeville. Then Simpkinson sat bolt upright in bed.\n\nOf course the youthful warrior undertook the commission. What youthful\nwarrior would not go any distance to see a beautiful young lady on a\ncliff, and what youthful warrior would not undertake any journey to\noblige a brother officer who was an Earl? Full instructions were at once\ngiven to him. He had better ask to see Mrs. O'Hara,--in describing whom\nNeville made no allusion to the dagger. He was told how to knock at\nthe door, and send in word by the servant to say that he had called on\nbehalf of Mr. Neville. He was to drive as far as Liscannor, and then get\nsome boy to accompany him on foot as a guide. He would not perhaps mind\nwalking two or three miles. Simpkinson declared that were it ten he\nwould not mind it. He was then to tell Mrs. O'Hara--just the truth. He\nwas to say that a messenger had come from Scroope announcing the death\nof the Earl, and that Neville had been obliged to start at once for\nEngland.\n\n\"But you will be back?\" said Simpkinson.\n\nNeville paused a moment. \"Yes, I shall be back, but don't say anything\nof that to either of the ladies.\"\n\n\"Must I say I don't know? They'll be sure to ask, I should say.\"\n\n\"Of course they'll ask. Just tell them that the whole thing has been\narranged so quickly that nothing has been settled, but that they shall\nhear from me at once. You can say that you suppose I shall be back, but\nthat I promised that I would write. Indeed that will be the exact truth,\nas I don't at all know what I may do. Be as civil to them as possible.\"\n\n\"That's of course.\"\n\n\"They are ladies, you know.\"\n\n\"I supposed that.\"\n\n\"And I am most desirous to do all in my power to oblige them. You can\nsay that I have arranged that other matter satisfactorily.\"\n\n\"That other matter?\"\n\n\"They'll understand. The mother will at least, and you'd better say that\nto her. You'll go early.\"\n\n\"I'll start at seven if you like.\"\n\n\"Eight or nine will do. Thank you, Simpkinson. I'm so much obliged to\nyou. I hope I shall see you over in England some day when things are a\nlittle settled.\" With this Simpkinson was delighted,--as he was also\nwith the commission entrusted to him.\n\nAnd so Fred Neville was the Earl of Scroope. Not that he owned even to\nhimself that the title and all belonging to it were as yet in his own\npossession. Till the body of the old man should be placed in the family\nvault he would still be simply Fred Neville, a lieutenant in Her\nMajesty's 20th Hussars. As he travelled home to Scroope, to the old\ngloomy mansion which was now in truth not only his home, but his own\nhouse, to do just as he pleased with it, he had much to fill his mind.\nHe was himself astonished to find with how great a weight his new\ndignities sat upon his shoulders, now that they were his own. But a\nfew months since he had thought and even spoken of shifting them from\nhimself to another, so that he might lightly enjoy a portion of the\nwealth which would belong to him without burdening himself with the\nduties of his position. He would take his yacht, and the girl he loved,\nand live abroad, with no present record of the coronet which would have\ndescended to him, and with no assumption of the title. But already that\nfeeling had died away within him. A few words spoken to him by the\npriest and a few serious thoughts within his own bosom had sufficed to\nexplain to him that he must be the Earl of Scroope. The family honours\nhad come to him, and he must support them,--either well or ill as his\nstrength and principles might govern him. And he did understand that it\nwas much to be a peer, an hereditary legislator, one who by the chance\nof his birth had a right to look for deferential respect even from his\nelders. It was much to be the lord of wide acres, the ruler of a large\ndomain, the landlord of many tenants who would at any rate regard\nthemselves as dependent on his goodness. It was much to be so placed\nthat no consideration of money need be a bar to any wish,--that the\nconsiderations which should bar his pleasures need be only those of\ndignity, character, and propriety. His uncle had told him more than once\nhow much a peer of England owed to his country and to his order;--how\nsuch a one is bound by no ordinary bonds to a life of high resolves, and\ngood endeavours. \"Sans reproche\" was the motto of his house, and was\nemblazoned on the wall of the hall that was now his own. If it might be\npossible to him he would live up to it and neither degrade his order nor\nbetray his country.\n\nBut as he thought of all this, he thought also of Kate O'Hara. With what\ndifficulties had he surrounded the commencement of this life which he\npurposed to lead! How was he to escape from the mess of trouble which he\nhad prepared for himself by his adventures in Ireland. An idea floated\nacross his mind that very many men who stand in their natural manhood\nhigh in the world's esteem, have in their early youth formed ties such\nas that which now bound him to Kate O'Hara,--that they have been silly\nas he had been, and had then escaped from the effects of their folly\nwithout grievous damage. But yet he did not see his mode of escape. If\nmoney could do it for him he would make almost any sacrifice. If wealth\nand luxury could make his Kate happy, she should be happy as a Princess.\nBut he did not believe either of her or of her mother that any money\nwould be accepted as a sufficient atonement. And he hated himself for\nsuggesting to himself that it might be possible. The girl was good, and\nhad trusted him altogether. The mother was self-denying, devoted, and\nhigh-spirited. He knew that money would not suffice.\n\nHe need not return to Ireland unless he pleased. He could send over some\nagent to arrange his affairs, and allow the two women to break their\nhearts in their solitude upon the cliffs. Were he to do so he did not\nbelieve that they would follow him. They would write doubtless, but\npersonally he might, probably, be quit of them in this fashion. But\nin this there would be a cowardice and a meanness which would make it\nimpossible that he should ever again respect himself.\n\nAnd thus he again entered Scroope, the lord and owner of all that he saw\naround him,--with by no means a happy heart or a light bosom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTHE EARL OF SCROOPE IS IN TROUBLE.\n\n\nNot a word was said to the young lord on his return home respecting the\nO'Haras till he himself had broached the subject. He found his brother\nJack Neville at Scroope on his arrival, and Sophie Mellerby was still\nstaying with his aunt. A day had been fixed for the funeral, but no one\nhad ventured to make any other arrangement till the heir and owner\nshould be there. He was received with solemn respect by the old servants\nwho, as he observed, abstained from calling him by any name. They knew\nthat it did not become them to transfer the former lord's title to the\nheir till all that remained of the former lord should be hidden from the\nworld in the family vault; but they could not bring themselves to\naddress a real Earl as Mr. Neville. His aunt was broken down by sorrow,\nbut nevertheless, she treated him with a courtly deference. To her he\nwas now the reigning sovereign among the Nevilles, and all Scroope and\neverything there was at his disposal. When he held her by the hand and\nspoke of her future life she only shook her head. \"I am an old woman,\nthough not in years old as was my lord. But my life is done, and it\nmatters not where I go.\"\n\n\"Dear aunt, do not speak of going. Where can you be so well as here?\"\nBut she only shook her head again and wept afresh. Of course it would\nnot be fitting that she should remain in the house of the young Earl who\nwas only her nephew by marriage. Scroope Manor would now become a house\nof joy, would be filled with the young and light of heart; there would\nbe feasting there and dancing; horses neighing before the doors, throngs\nof carriages, new furniture, bright draperies, and perhaps, alas, loud\nrevellings. It would not be fit that such a one as she should be at\nScroope now that her lord had left her.\n\nThe funeral was an affair not of pomp but of great moment in those\nparts. Two or three Nevilles from other counties came to the house, as\ndid also sundry relatives bearing other names. Mr. Mellerby was there,\nand one or two of the late Earl's oldest friends; but the great\ngathering was made up of the Scroope tenants, not one of whom failed to\nsee his late landlord laid in his grave. \"My Lord,\" said an old man to\nFred, one who was himself a peer and was the young lord's cousin though\nthey two had never met before, \"My Lord,\" said the old man, as soon as\nthey had returned from the grave, \"you are called upon to succeed as\ngood a man as ever it has been my lot to know. I loved him as a brother.\nI hope you will not lightly turn away from his example.\" Fred made some\npromise which at the moment he certainly intended to perform.\n\nOn the next morning the will was read. There was nothing in it, nor\ncould there have been anything in it, which might materially affect the\ninterests of the heir. The late lord's widow was empowered to take away\nfrom Scroope anything that she desired. In regard to money she was\nprovided for so amply that money did not matter to her. A whole year's\nincome from the estates was left to the heir in advance, so that he\nmight not be driven to any momentary difficulty in assuming the\nresponsibilities of his station. A comparatively small sum was left to\nJack Neville, and a special gem to Sophie Mellerby. There were bequests\nto all the servants, a thousand pounds to the vicar of the\nparish,--which perhaps was the only legacy which astonished the\nlegatee,--and his affectionate love to every tenant on the estate. All\nthe world acknowledged that it was as good a will as the Earl could have\nmade. Then the last of the strangers left the house, and the Earl of\nScroope was left to begin his reign and do his duty as best he might.\n\nJack had promised to remain with him for a few days, and Sophie\nMellerby, who had altogether given up her London season, was to stay\nwith the widow till something should be settled as to a future\nresidence. \"If my aunt will only say that she will keep the house for a\ncouple of years, she shall have it,\" said Fred to the young\nlady,--perhaps wishing to postpone for so long a time the embarrassment\nof the large domain; but to this Lady Scroope would not consent. If\nallowed she would remain till the end of July. By that time she would\nfind herself a home.\n\n\"For the life of me, I don't know how to begin my life,\" said the new\npeer to his brother as they were walking about the park together.\n\n\"Do not think about beginning it at all. You won't be angry, and will\nknow what I mean, when I say that you should avoid thinking too much of\nyour own position.\"\n\n\"How am I to help thinking of it? It is so entirely changed from what it\nwas.\"\n\n\"No Fred,--not entirely; nor as I hope, is it changed at all in those\nmatters which are of most importance to you. A man's self, and his ideas\nof the manner in which he should rule himself, should be more to him\nthan any outward accidents. Had that cousin of ours never died--\"\n\n\"I almost wish he never had.\"\n\n\"It would then have been your ambition to live as an honourable\ngentleman. To be that now should be more to you than to be an Earl and a\nman of fortune.\"\n\n\"It's very easy to preach, Jack. You were always good at that. But here\nI am, and what am I to do? How am I to begin? Everybody says that I am\nto change nothing. The tenants will pay their rents, and Burnaby will\nlook after things outside, and Mrs. Bunce will look after the things\ninside, and I may sit down and read a novel. When the gloom of my\nuncle's death has passed away, I suppose I shall buy a few more horses\nand perhaps begin to make a row about the pheasants. I don't know what\nelse there is to do.\"\n\n\"You'll find that there are duties.\"\n\n\"I suppose I shall. Something is expected of me. I am to keep up the\nhonour of the family; but it really seems to me that the best way of\ndoing so would be to sit in my uncle's arm chair and go to sleep as he\ndid.\"\n\n\"As a first step in doing something you should get a wife for yourself.\nIf once you had a settled home, things would arrange themselves round\nyou very easily.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes;--a wife. You know, Jack, I told you about that girl in County\nClare.\"\n\n\"You must let nothing of that kind stand in your way.\"\n\n\"Those are your ideas of high moral grandeur! Just now my own personal\nconduct was to be all in all to me, and the rank nothing. Now I am to\ndesert a girl I love because I am an English peer.\"\n\n\"What has passed between you and the young lady, of course I do not\nknow.\"\n\n\"I may as well tell you the whole truth,\" said Fred. And he told it. He\ntold it honestly,--almost honestly. It is very hard for a man to tell a\nstory truly against himself, but he intended to tell the whole truth.\n\"Now what must I do? Would you have me marry her?\" Jack Neville paused\nfor a long time. \"At any rate you can say yes, or no.\"\n\n\"It is very hard to say yes, or no.\"\n\n\"I can marry no one else. I can see my way so far. You had better tell\nSophie Mellerby everything, and then a son of yours shall be the future\nEarl.\"\n\n\"We are both of us young as yet, Fred, and need not think of that. If\nyou do mean to marry Miss O'Hara you should lose not a day;--not a day.\"\n\n\"But what if I don't. You are always very ready with advice, but you\nhave given me none as yet.\"\n\n\"How can I advise you? I should have heard the very words in which you\nmade your promise before I could dare to say whether it should be kept\nor broken. As a rule a man should keep his word.\"\n\n\"Let the consequences be what they may?\"\n\n\"A man should keep his word certainly. And I know no promise so solemn\nas that made to a woman when followed by conduct such as yours has\nbeen.\"\n\n\"And what will people say then as to my conduct to the family? How will\nthey look on me when I bring home the daughter of that scoundrel?\"\n\n\"You should have thought of that before.\"\n\n\"But I was not told. Do you not see that I was deceived there. Mrs.\nO'Hara clearly said that the man was dead. And she told me nothing of\nthe galleys.\"\n\n\"How could she tell you that?\"\n\n\"But if she has deceived me, how can I be expected to keep my promise? I\nlove the girl dearly. If I could change places with you, I would do so\nthis very minute, and take her away with me, and she should certainly be\nmy wife. If it were only myself, I would give up all to her. I would, by\nheaven. But I cannot sacrifice the family. As to solemn promises, did I\nnot swear to my uncle that I would not disgrace the family by such a\nmarriage? Almost the last word that I spoke to him was that. Am I to be\nuntrue to him? There are times in which it seems impossible that a man\nshould do right.\"\n\n\"There are times in which a man may be too blind to see the right,\" said\nJack,--sparing his brother in that he did not remind him that those\ndilemmas always come from original wrong-doing.\n\n\"I think I am resolved not to marry her,\" said Fred.\n\n\"If I were in your place I think I should marry her,\" said Jack;--\"but I\nwill not speak with certainty even of myself.\"\n\n\"I shall not. But I will be true to her all the same. You may be sure\nthat I shall not marry at all.\" Then he recurred to his old scheme. \"If\nI can find any mode of marrying her in some foreign country, so that her\nson and mine shall not be the legitimate heir to the title and estates,\nI would go there at once with her, though it were to the further end of\nthe world. You can understand now what I mean when I say that I do not\nknow how to begin.\" Jack acknowledged that in that matter he did\nunderstand his brother. It is always hard for a man to commence any new\nduty when he knows that he has a millstone round his neck which will\nprobably make that duty impracticable at last.\n\nHe went on with his life at Scroope for a week after the funeral without\nresolving upon anything, or taking any steps towards solving the O'Hara\ndifficulty. He did ride about among the tenants, and gave some trifling\norders as to the house and stables. His brother was still with him, and\nMiss Mellerby remained at the Manor. But he knew that the thunder-cloud\nmust break over his head before long, and at last the storm was\ncommenced. The first drops fell upon him in the soft form of a letter\nfrom Kate O'Hara.\n\n\n   DEAREST FRED,\n\n   I am not quite sure that I ought to address you like that; but\n   I always shall unless you tell me not. We have been expecting a\n   letter from you every day since you went. Your friend from Ennis\n   came here, and brought us the news of your uncle's death. We\n   were very sorry; at least I was certainly. I liked to think of\n   you a great deal better as my own Fred, than as a great lord.\n   But you will still be my own Fred always; will you not?\n\n   Mother said at once that it was a matter of course that you\n   should go to England; but your friend, whose name we never heard,\n   said that you had sent him especially to promise that you would\n   write quite immediately, and that you would come back very soon.\n   I do not know what he will think of me, because I asked him\n   whether he was quite, quite sure that you would come back. If he\n   thinks that I love you better than my own soul, he only thinks\n   the truth.\n\n   Pray,--pray write at once. Mother is getting vexed because there\n   is no letter. I am never vexed with my own darling love, but I\n   do so long for a letter. If you knew how I felt, I do think you\n   would write almost every day,--if it were only just one short\n   word. If you would say, 'Dear Love,' that would be enough. And\n   pray come. Oh do, do, pray come! Cannot you think how I must\n   long to see you! The gentleman who came here said that you would\n   come, and I know you will. But pray come soon. Think, now, how\n   you are all the world to me. You are more than all the world to\n   me.\n\n   I am not ill as I was when you were here. But I never go outside\n   the door now. I never shall go outside the door again till you\n   come. I don't care now for going out upon the rocks. I don't care\n   even for the birds as you are not here to watch them with me. I\n   sit with the skin of the seal you gave me behind my head, and I\n   pretend to sleep. But though I am quite still for hours I am not\n   asleep, but thinking always of you.\n\n   We have neither seen or heard anything more of my father,\n   and Father Marty says that you have managed about that very\n   generously. You are always generous and good. I was so wretched\n   all that day, that I thought I should have died. You will not\n   think ill of your Kate, will you, because her father is bad?\n\n   Pray write when you get this, and above all things let us know\n   when you will come to us.\n\n   Always, always, and always,\n\n   Your own\n\n   KATE.\n\n\nTwo days after this, while the letter was still unanswered, there came\nanother from Mrs. O'Hara which was, if possible, more grievous to him\nthan that from her daughter.\n\n\"My Lord,\" the letter began. When he read this he turned from it with a\nsickening feeling of disgust. Of course the woman knew that he was now\nEarl of Scroope; but it would have been so desirable that there should\nhave been no intercourse between her and him except under the name by\nwhich she had hitherto known him. And then in the appellation as she\nused it there seemed to be a determination to reproach him which must,\nhe knew, lead to great misery.\n\n\n   MY LORD,\n\n   The messenger you sent to us brought us good news, and told us\n   that you were gone home to your own affairs. That I suppose was\n   right, but why have you not written to us before this? Why have\n   you not told my poor girl that you will come to her, and atone\n   to her for the injury you have done in the only manner now\n   possible? I cannot and do not believe that you intend to evade\n   the solemn promises that you have made her, and allow her to\n   remain here a ruined outcast, and the mother of your child. I\n   have thought you to be both a gentleman and a christian, and I\n   still think so. Most assuredly you would be neither were you\n   disposed to leave her desolate, while you are in prosperity.\n\n   I call upon you, my lord, in the most solemn manner, with all\n   the energy and anxiety of a mother,--of one who will be of all\n   women the most broken-hearted if you wrong her,--to write at\n   once and let me know when you will be here to keep your promise.\n   For the sake of your own offspring I implore you not to delay.\n\n   We feel under deep obligations to you for what you did in\n   respect of that unhappy man. We have never for a moment doubted\n   your generosity.\n\n   Yours, My Lord,\n\n   With warmest affection, if you will admit it,\n\n   C. O'HARA.\n\n   P.S. I ask you to come at once and keep your word. Were you to\n   think of breaking it, I would follow you through the world.\n\n\nThe young Earl, when he received this, was not at a loss for a moment to\nattribute the body of Mrs. O'Hara's letter to Father Marty's power of\ncomposition, and the postscript to the unaided effort of the lady\nherself. Take it as he might--as coming from Mrs. O'Hara or from the\npriest,--he found the letter to be a great burden to him. He had not as\nyet answered the one received from Kate, as to the genuineness of which\nhe had entertained no doubt. How should he answer such letters? Some\nanswer must of course be sent, and must be the forerunner of his future\nconduct. But how should he write his letter when he had not as yet\nresolved what his conduct should be?\n\nHe did attempt to write a letter, not to either of the ladies, but to\nthe priest, explaining that in the ordinary sense of the word he could\nnot and would not marry Miss O'Hara, but that in any way short of that\nlegitimate and usual mode of marriage, he would bind himself to her, and\nthat when so bound he would be true to her for life. He would make any\nsettlement that he, Father Marty, might think right either upon the\nmother or upon the daughter. But Countess of Scroope the daughter of\nthat Captain O'Hara should not become through his means. Then he\nendeavoured to explain the obligation laid upon him by his uncle, and\nthe excuse which he thought he could plead in not having been informed\nof Captain O'Hara's existence. But the letter when written seemed to him\nto be poor and mean, cringing and at the same time false. He told\nhimself that it would not suffice. It was manifest to him that he must\ngo back to County Clare, even though he should encounter Mrs. O'Hara,\ndagger in hand. What was any personal danger to himself in such an\naffair as this? And if he did not fear a woman's dagger, was he to fear\na woman's tongue,--or the tongue of a priest? So he tore the letter, and\nresolved that he would write and name a day on which he would appear at\nArdkill. At any rate such a letter as that might be easily written, and\nmight be made soft with words of love.\n\n\n   DEAREST KATE,\n\n   I will be with you on the 15th or on the 16th at latest. You\n   should remember that a man has a good deal to do and think of\n   when he gets pitchforked into such a new phase of life as mine.\n   Do not, however, think that I quarrel with you, my darling.\n   That I will never do. My love to your mother.\n\n   Ever your own,\n\n   FRED.\n\n   I hate signing the other name.\n\n\nThis letter was not only written but sent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nSANS REPROCHE.\n\n\nThree or four days after writing his letter to Kate O'Hara, the Earl\ntold his aunt that he must return to Ireland, and he named the day on\nwhich he would leave Scroope. \"I did not think that you would go back\nthere,\" she said. He could see by the look of her face and by the\nanxious glance of her eye that she had in her heart the fear of Kate\nO'Hara,--as he had also.\n\n\"I must return. I came away at a moment's notice.\"\n\n\"But you have written about leaving the regiment.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I have done that. In the peculiar circumstances I don't suppose\nthey will want me to serve again. Indeed I've had a letter, just a\nprivate note, from one of the fellows at the Horse Guards explaining all\nthat.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you should go at all;--indeed I do not.\"\n\n\"What am I to do about my things? I owe some money. I've got three or\nfour horses there. My very clothes are all about just as I left them\nwhen I came away.\"\n\n\"Any body can manage all that. Give the horses away.\"\n\n\"I had rather not give away my horses,\" he said laughing. \"The fact is I\nmust go.\" She could urge nothing more to him on that occasion. She did\nnot then mention the existence of Kate O'Hara. But he knew well that she\nwas thinking of the girl, and he knew also that the activity of Lady\nMary Quin had not slackened. But his aunt, he thought, was more afraid\nof him now that he was the Earl than she had been when he was only the\nheir; and it might be that this feeling would save him from the mention\nof Kate O'Hara's name.\n\nTo some extent the dowager was afraid of her nephew. She knew at least\nthat the young man was all-powerful and might act altogether as he\nlisted. In whatever she might say she could not now be supported by the\nauthority of the Lord of Scroope. He himself was lord of Scroope; and\nwere he to tell her simply to hold her tongue and mind her own business\nshe could only submit. But she was not the woman to allow any sense of\nfear, or any solicitude as to the respect due to herself, to stand in\nthe way of the performance of a duty. It may be declared on her behalf\nthat had it been in her nephew's power to order her head off in\npunishment for her interference, she would still have spoken had she\nconceived it to be right to speak.\n\nBut within her own bosom there had been dreadful conflicts as to that\nduty. Lady Mary Quin had by no means slackened her activity. Lady Mary\nQuin had learned the exact condition of Kate O'Hara, and had sent the\nnews to her friend with greedy rapidity. And in sending it Lady Mary\nQuin entertained no slightest doubt as to the duty of the present Earl\nof Scroope. According to her thinking it could not be the duty of an\nEarl of Scroope in any circumstances to marry a Kate O'Hara. There are\nwomen, who in regard to such troubles as now existed at Ardkill cottage,\nalways think that the woman should be punished as the sinner and that\nthe man should be assisted to escape. The hardness of heart of such\nwomen,--who in all other views of life are perhaps tender and\nsoft-natured,--is one of the marvels of our social system. It is as\nthough a certain line were drawn to include all women,--a line, but,\nalas, little more than a line,--by overstepping which, or rather by\nbeing known to have overstepped it, a woman ceases to be a woman in the\nestimation of her own sex. That the existence of this feeling has strong\neffect in saving women from passing the line, none of us can doubt. That\nits general tendency may be good rather than evil, is possible. But the\nhardness necessary to preserve the rule, a hardness which must be\nexclusively feminine but which is seldom wanting, is a marvellous\nfeature in the female character. Lady Mary Quin probably thought but\nlittle on the subject. The women in the cottage on the cliff, who were\nbefriended by Father Marty, were to her dangerous scheming Roman\nCatholic adventurers. The proper triumph of Protestant virtue required\nthat they should fail in their adventures. She had always known that\nthere would be something disreputable heard of them sooner or later.\nWhen the wretched Captain came into the neighbourhood,--and she soon\nheard of his coming,--she was gratified by feeling that her convictions\nhad been correct. When the sad tidings as to poor Kate reached her ears,\nshe had \"known that it would be so.\" That such a girl should be made\nCountess of Scroope in reward for her wickedness would be to her an\nevent horrible, almost contrary to Divine Providence,--a testimony that\nthe Evil One was being allowed peculiar power at the moment, and would\nno doubt have been used in her own circles to show the ruin that had\nbeen brought upon the country by Catholic emancipation. She did not for\na moment doubt that the present Earl should be encouraged to break any\npromises of marriage to the making of which he might have been allured.\n\nBut it was not so with Lady Scroope. She, indeed, came to the same\nconclusion as her friend, but she did so with much difficulty and after\nmany inward struggles. She understood and valued the customs of the\nmagic line. In her heart of hearts she approved of a different code of\nmorals for men and women. That which merited instant, and as regarded\nthis world, perpetual condemnation in a woman, might in a man be very\neasily forgiven. A sigh, a shake of the head, and some small innocent\nstratagem that might lead to a happy marriage and settlement in life\nwith increased income, would have been her treatment of such sin for the\nheirs of the great and wealthy. She knew that the world could not afford\nto ostracise the men,--though happily it might condemn the women.\nNevertheless, when she came to the single separated instance, though her\nheart melted with no ruth for the woman,--in such cases the woman must\nbe seen before the ruth is felt,--though pity for Kate O'Hara did not\ninfluence her, she did acknowledge the sanctity of a gentleman's word.\nIf, as Lady Mary told her, and as she could so well believe, the present\nEarl of Scroope had given to this girl a promise that he would marry\nher, if he had bound himself by his pledged word, as a nobleman and a\ngentleman, how could she bid him become a perjured knave? Sans reproche!\nWas he thus to begin to live and to deserve the motto of his house by\nthe conduct of his life?\n\nBut then the evil that would be done was so great! She did not for a\nmoment doubt all that Lady Mary told her about the girl. The worst of it\nhad indeed been admitted. She was a Roman Catholic, ill-born,\nill-connected, damaged utterly by a parent so low that nothing lower\ncould possibly be raked out of the world's gutters. And now the girl\nherself was--a castaway. Such a marriage as that of which Lady Mary\nspoke would not only injure the house of Scroope for the present\ngeneration, but would tend to its final downfall. Would it not be known\nthroughout all England that the next Earl of Scroope would be the\ngrandson of a convict? Might there not be questions as to the legitimacy\nof the assumed heir? She herself knew of noble families which had been\nscattered, confounded, and almost ruined by such imprudence. Hitherto\nthe family of Scroope had been continued from generation to generation\nwithout stain,--almost without stain. It had felt it to be a fortunate\nthing that the late heir had died because of the pollution of his\nwretched marriage. And now must evil as bad befall it, worse evil\nperhaps, through the folly of this young man? Must that proud motto be\ntaken down from its place in the hall from very shame? But the evil had\nnot been done yet, and it might be that her words could save the house\nfrom ruin and disgrace.\n\nShe was a woman of whom it may be said that whatever difficulty she\nmight have in deciding a question she could recognise the necessity of a\ndecision and could abide by it when she had made it. It was with great\ndifficulty that she could bring herself to think that an Earl of Scroope\nshould be false to a promise by which he had seduced a woman, but she\ndid succeed in bringing herself to such thought. Her very heart bled\nwithin her as she acknowledged the necessity. A lie to her was\nabominable. A lie, to be told by herself, would have been hideous to\nher. A lie to be told by him, was worse. As virtue, what she called\nvirtue, was the one thing indispensable to women, so was truth the one\nthing indispensable to men. And yet she must tell him to lie, and having\nresolved so to tell him, must use all her intellect to defend the\nlie,--and to insist upon it.\n\nHe was determined to return to Ireland, and there was nothing that she\ncould do to prevent his return. She could not bid him shun a danger\nsimply because it was a danger. He was his own master, and were she to\ndo so he would only laugh at her. Of authority with him she had none. If\nshe spoke, he must listen. Her position would secure so much to her from\ncourtesy,--and were she to speak of the duty which he owed to his name\nand to the family he could hardly laugh. She therefore sent to him a\nmessage. Would he kindly go to her in her own room? Of course he\nattended to her wishes and went. \"You mean to leave us to-morrow, Fred,\"\nshe said. We all know the peculiar solemnity of a widow's dress,--the\nlook of self-sacrifice on the part of the woman which the dress creates;\nand have perhaps recognised the fact that if the woman be deterred by no\nnecessities of oeconomy in her toilet,--as in such material\ncircumstances the splendour is more perfect if splendour be the\nobject,--so also is the self-sacrifice more abject. And with this widow\nan appearance of melancholy solemnity, almost of woe, was natural to\nher. She was one whose life had ever been serious, solemn, and sad.\nWealth and the outward pomp of circumstances had conferred upon her a\ncertain dignity; and with that doubtless there had reached her some\nfeeling of satisfaction. Religion too had given her comfort, and a\nroutine of small duties had saved her from the wretchedness of ennui.\nBut life with her had had no laughter, and had seldom smiled. Now in the\nfirst days of her widowhood she regarded her course as run, and looked\nupon herself as one who, in speaking, almost spoke from the tomb. All\nthis had its effect upon the young lord. She did inspire him with a\ncertain awe; and though her weeds gave her no authority, they did give\nher weight.\n\n\"Yes; I shall start to-morrow,\" he replied.\n\n\"And you still mean to go to Ireland?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I must go to Ireland. I shan't stay there, you know.\"\n\nThen she paused a moment before she proceeded. \"Shall you see--that\nyoung woman when you are there?\"\n\n\"I suppose I shall see her.\"\n\n\"Pray do not think that I desire to interfere with your private affairs.\nI know well that I have no right to assume over you any of that\naffectionate authority which a mother might have,--though in truth I\nlove you as a son.\"\n\n\"I would treat you just as I would my own mother.\"\n\n\"No, Fred; that cannot be so. A mother would throw her arms round you\nand cling to you if she saw you going into danger. A mother would follow\nyou, hoping that she might save you.\"\n\n\"But there is no danger.\"\n\n\"Ah, Fred, I fear there is.\"\n\n\"What danger?\"\n\n\"You are now the head of one of the oldest and the noblest families in\nthis which in my heart I believe to be the least sinful among the sinful\nnations of the wicked world.\"\n\n\"I don't quite know how that may be;--I mean about the world. Of course\nI understand about the family.\"\n\n\"But you love your country?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. I don't think there's any place like England,--to live in.\"\n\n\"And England is what it is because there are still some left among us\nwho are born to high rank and who know how to live up to the standard\nthat is required of them. If ever there was such a man, your uncle was\nsuch a one.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he was;--just what he ought to have been.\"\n\n\"Honourable, true, affectionate, self-denying, affable to all men, but\never conscious of his rank, giving much because much had been given to\nhim, asserting his nobility for the benefit of those around him, proud\nof his order for the sake of his country, bearing his sorrows with the\ndignity of silence, a nobleman all over, living on to the end sans\nreproche! He was a man whom you may dare to imitate, though to follow\nhim may be difficult.\" She spoke not loudly, but clearly, looking him\nfull in the face as she stood motionless before him.\n\n\"He was all that,\" said Fred, almost overpowered by the sincere\nsolemnity of his aunt's manner.\n\n\"Will you try to walk in his footsteps?\"\n\n\"Two men can never be like one another in that way. I shall never be\nwhat he was. But I'll endeavour to get along as well as I can.\"\n\n\"You will remember your order?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will. I do remember it. Mind you, aunt, I am not glad that I\nbelong to it. I think I do understand about it all, and will do my best.\nBut Jack would have made a better Earl than I shall do. That's the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"The Lord God has placed you,--and you must pray to Him that He will\nenable you to do your duty in that state of life to which it has pleased\nHim to call you. You are here and must bear his decree; and whether it\nbe a privilege to enjoy, you must enjoy it, or a burden to bear, you\nmust endure it.\"\n\n\"It is so of course.\"\n\n\"Knowing that, you must know also how incumbent it is upon you not to\ndefile the stock from which you are sprung.\"\n\n\"I suppose it has been defiled,\" said Fred, who had been looking into\nthe history of the family. \"The ninth Earl seems to have married nobody\nknows whom. And his son was my uncle's grandfather.\"\n\nThis was a blow to Lady Scroope, but she bore it with dignity and\ncourage. \"You would hardly wish it to be said that you had copied the\nonly one of your ancestors who did amiss. The world was rougher then\nthan it is now, and he of whom you speak was a soldier.\"\n\n\"I'm a soldier too,\" said the Earl.\n\n\"Oh, Fred, is it thus you answer me! He was a soldier in rough times,\nwhen there were wars. I think he married when he was with the army under\nMarlborough.\"\n\n\"I have not seen anything of that kind, certainly.\"\n\n\"Your country is at peace, and your place is here, among your tenantry,\nat Scroope. You will promise me, Fred, that you will not marry this girl\nin Ireland?\"\n\n\"If I do, the fault will be all with that old maid at Castle Quin.\"\n\n\"Do not say that, Fred. It is impossible. Let her conduct have been what\nit may, it cannot make that right in you which would have been wrong, or\nthat wrong which would have been right.\"\n\n\"She's a nasty meddlesome cat.\"\n\n\"I will not talk about her. What good would it do? You cannot at any\nrate be surprised at my extreme anxiety. You did promise your uncle most\nsolemnly that you would never marry this young lady.\"\n\n\"If I did, that ought to be enough.\" He was now waxing angry and his\nface was becoming red. He would bear a good deal from his uncle's widow,\nbut he felt his own power and was not prepared to bear much more.\n\n\"Of course I cannot bind you. I know well how impotent I am,--how\npowerless to exercise control. But I think, Fred, that for your uncle's\nsake you will not refuse to repeat your promise to me, if you intend to\nkeep it. Why is it that I am so anxious? It is for your sake, and for\nthe sake of a name which should be dearer to you than it is even to me.\"\n\n\"I have no intention of marrying at all.\"\n\n\"Do not say that.\"\n\n\"I do say it. I do not want to keep either you or Jack in the dark as to\nmy future life. This young lady,--of whom, by the by, neither you nor\nLady Mary Quin know anything, shall not become Countess of Scroope. To\nthat I have made up my mind.\"\n\n\"Thank God.\"\n\n\"But as long as she lives I will make no woman Countess of Scroope. Let\nJack marry this girl that he is in love with. They shall live here and\nhave the house to themselves if they like it. He will look after the\nproperty and shall have whatever income old Mellerby thinks proper. I\nwill keep the promise I made to my uncle,--but the keeping of it will\nmake it impossible for me to live here. I would prefer now that you\nshould say no more on the subject.\" Then he left her, quitting the room\nwith some stateliness in his step, as though conscious that at such a\nmoment as this it behoved him to assume his rank.\n\nThe dowager sat alone all that morning thinking of the thing she had\ndone. She did now believe that he was positively resolved not to marry\nKate O'Hara, and she believed also that she herself had fixed him in\nthat resolution. In doing so had she or had she not committed a deadly\nsin? She knew almost with accuracy what had occurred on the coast of\nClare. A young girl, innocent herself up to that moment, had been\nenticed to her ruin by words of love which had been hallowed in her ears\nby vows of marriage. Those vows which had possessed so deadly an\nefficacy, were now to be simply broken! The cruelty to her would be\ndamnable, devilish,--surely worthy of hell if any sin of man can be so\ncalled! And she, who could not divest herself of a certain pride taken\nin the austere morality of her own life, she who was now a widow anxious\nto devote her life solely to God, had persuaded the man to this sin, in\norder that her successor as Countess of Scroope might not be, in her\nopinion, unfitting for nobility! The young lord had promised her that he\nwould be guilty of this sin, so damnable, so devilish, telling her as he\ndid so, that as a consequence of his promise he must continue to live a\nlife of wickedness! In the agony of her spirit she threw herself upon\nher knees and implored the Lord to pardon her and to guide her. But even\nwhile kneeling before the throne of heaven she could not drive the pride\nof birth out of her heart. That the young Earl might be saved from the\ndamning sin and also from the polluting marriage;--that was the prayer\nshe prayed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nLOOSE ABOUT THE WORLD.\n\n\nThe Countess was seen no more on that day,--was no more seen at least by\neither of the two brothers. Miss Mellerby was with her now and again,\nbut on each occasion only for a few minutes, and reported that Lady\nScroope was ill and could not appear at dinner. She would, however, see\nher nephew before he started on the following morning.\n\nFred himself was much affected by the interview with his aunt. No doubt\nhe had made a former promise to his uncle, similar to that which had now\nbeen exacted from him. No doubt he had himself resolved, after what he\nhad thought to be mature consideration that he would not marry the girl,\njustifying to himself this decision by the deceit which he thought had\nbeen practised upon him in regard to Captain O'Hara. Nevertheless, he\nfelt that by what had now occurred he was bound more strongly against\nthe marriage than he had ever been bound before. His promise to his\nuncle might have been regarded as being obligatory only as long as his\nuncle lived. His own decision he would have been at liberty to change\nwhen he pleased to do so. But, though his aunt was almost nothing to\nhim,--was not in very truth his aunt, but only the widow of his uncle,\nthere had been a solemnity about the engagement as he had now made\nit with her, which he felt to be definitely binding. He must go to\nArdkill prepared to tell them absolutely the truth. He would make any\narrangement they pleased as to their future joint lives, so long as it\nwas an arrangement by which Kate should not become Countess of Scroope.\nHe did not attempt to conceal from himself the dreadful nature of the\ntask before him. He knew what would be the indignation of the priest. He\ncould picture to himself the ferocity of the mother, defending her young\nas a lioness would her whelp. He could imagine that that dagger might\nagain be brought from its hiding place. And, worse than all, he would\nsee the girl prostrate in her woe, and appealing to his love and to his\noaths, when the truth as to her future life should be revealed to her.\nBut yet he did not think of shunning the task before him. He could not\nendure to live a coward in his own esteem.\n\nHe was unlike himself and very melancholy. \"It has been so good of\nyou to remain here,\" he said to Sophie Mellerby. They had now become\nintimate and almost attached to each other as friends. If she had\nallowed a spark of hope to become bright within her heart in regard to\nthe young Earl that had long since been quenched. She had acknowledged\nto herself that had it been possible in other respects they would not\nhave suited each other,--and now they were friends.\n\n\"I love your aunt dearly and have been very glad to be with her.\"\n\n\"I wish you would learn to love somebody else dearly.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I shall, some day,--somebody else; though I don't at all know\nwho it may be.\"\n\n\"You know whom I mean.\"\n\n\"I suppose I do.\"\n\n\"And why not love him? Isn't he a good fellow?\"\n\n\"One can't love all the good fellows, Lord Scroope.\"\n\n\"You'll never find a better one than he is.\"\n\n\"Did he commission you to speak for him?\"\n\n\"You know he didn't. You know that he would be the last man in the world\nto do so?\"\n\n\"I was surprised.\"\n\n\"But I had a reason for speaking.\"\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose it will have any effect with you;--but it is something\nyou ought to know. If any man of my age can be supposed to have made up\nhis mind on such a matter, you may believe that I have made up my mind\nthat I will--never marry.\"\n\n\"What nonsense, Lord Scroope.\"\n\n\"Well;--yes; perhaps it is. But I am so convinced of it myself that I\nshall ask my brother to come and live here--permanently,--as master of\nthe place. As he would have to leave his regiment it would of course be\nnecessary that his position here should be settled,--and it shall be\nsettled.\"\n\n\"I most sincerely hope that you will always live here yourself.\"\n\n\"It won't suit me. Circumstances have made it impossible. If he will not\ndo so, nor my aunt, the house must be shut up. I am most anxious that\nthis should not be done. I shall implore him to remain here, and to be\nhere exactly as I should have been,--had things with me not have been so\nvery unfortunate. He will at any rate have a house to offer you, if--\"\n\n\"Lord Scroope!\"\n\n\"I know what you are going to say, Sophie.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I am as yet disposed to marry for the sake of a house\nto shelter me.\"\n\n\"Of course you would say that; but still I think that I have been right\nto tell you. I am sure you will believe my assurance that Jack knows\nnothing of all this.\"\n\nThat same evening he said nearly the same thing to his brother, though\nin doing so he made no special allusion to Sophie Mellerby. \"I know that\nthere is a great deal that a fellow should do, living in such a house as\nthis, but I am not the man to do it. It's a very good kind of life, if\nyou happen to be up to it. I am not, but you are.\"\n\n\"My dear Fred, you can't change the accidents of birth.\"\n\n\"In a great measure I can; or at least we can do so between us. You\ncan't be Lord Scroope, but you can be master of Scroope Manor.\"\n\n\"No I can't;--and, which is more, I won't. Don't think I am uncivil.\"\n\n\"You are uncivil, Jack.\"\n\n\"At any rate I am not ungrateful. I only want you to understand\nthoroughly that such an arrangement is out of the question. In no\ncondition of life would I care to be the locum tenens for another man.\nYou are now five or six and twenty. At thirty you may be a married man\nwith an absolute need for your own house.\"\n\n\"I would execute any deed.\"\n\n\"So that I might be enabled to keep the owner of the property out of the\nonly place that is fit for him! It is a power which I should not use,\nand do not wish to possess. Believe me, Fred, that a man is bound to\nsubmit himself to the circumstances by which he is surrounded, when it\nis clear that they are beneficial to the world at large. There must be\nan Earl of Scroope, and you at present are the man.\"\n\nThey were sitting together out upon the terrace after dinner, and for a\ntime there was silence. His brother's arguments were too strong for the\nyoung lord, and it was out of his power to deal with one so dogmatic.\nBut he did not forget the last words that had been spoken. It may be\nthat \"I shall not be the man very long,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Any of us may die to-day or to-morrow,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I have a kind of presentiment,--not that I shall die, but that I shall\nnever see Scroope again. It seems as though I were certainly leaving for\never a place that has always been distasteful to me.\"\n\n\"I never believe anything of presentiments.\"\n\n\"No; of course not. You're not that sort of fellow at all. But I am. I\ncan't think of myself as living here with a dozen old fogies about the\nplace all doing nothing, touching their hats, my-lording me at every\nturn, looking respectable, but as idle as pickpockets.\"\n\n\"You'll have to do it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I shall, but I don't think it.\" Then there was again silence\nfor a time. \"The less said about it the better, but I know that I've got\na very difficult job before me in Ireland.\"\n\n\"I don't envy you, Fred;--not that.\"\n\n\"It is no use talking about it. It has got to be done, and the sooner\ndone the better. What I shall do when it is done, I have not the most\nremote idea. Where I shall be living this day month I cannot guess. I\ncan only say one thing certainly, and that is that I shall not come back\nhere. There never was a fellow so loose about the world as I am.\"\n\nIt was terrible that a young man who had it in his power to do so much\ngood or so much evil should have had nothing to bind him to the better\ncourse! There was the motto of his house, and the promises which he had\nmade to his uncle persuading him to that which was respectable and as he\nthought dull; and opposed to those influences there was an unconquerable\nfeeling on his own part that he was altogether unfitted for the kind\nof life that was expected of him. Joined to this there was the fact of\nthat unfortunate connection in Ireland from which he knew that it would\nbe base to fly, and which, as it seemed to him, made any attempt at\nrespectability impossible to him.\n\nEarly on the following morning, as he was preparing to start, his aunt\nagain sent for him. She came out to him in the sitting-room adjoining\nher bedroom and there embraced him. Her eyes were red with weeping, and\nher face wan with care. \"Fred,\" she said; \"dear Fred.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, aunt. The last word I have to say is that I implore you not\nto leave Scroope as long as you are comfortable here.\"\n\n\"You will come back?\"\n\n\"I cannot say anything certain about that.\"\n\nShe still had hold of him with both hands and was looking into his face\nwith loving, frightened, wistful eyes. \"I know,\" she said, \"that you\nwill be thinking of what passed between us yesterday.\"\n\n\"Certainly I shall remember it.\"\n\n\"I have been praying for you, Fred; and now I tell you to look to your\nFather which is in Heaven for guidance, and not to take it from any poor\nfrail sinful human being. Ask Him to keep your feet steady in the path,\nand your heart pure, and your thoughts free from wickedness. Oh, Fred,\nkeep your mind and body clear before Him, and if you will kneel to Him\nfor protection, He will show you a way through all difficulties.\" It was\nthus that she intended to tell him that his promise to her, made on the\nprevious day, was to count for nought, and that he was to marry the girl\nif by no other way he could release himself from vice. But she could not\nbring herself to declare to him in plain terms that he had better marry\nKate O'Hara, and bring his new Countess to Scroope in order that she\nmight be fitly received by her predecessor. It might be that the Lord\nwould still show him a way out of the two evils.\n\nBut his brother was more clear of purpose with him, as they walked\ntogether out to the yard in which the young Earl was to get into his\ncarriage. \"Upon the whole, Fred, if I were you I should marry that\ngirl.\" This he said quite abruptly. The young lord shook his head. \"It\nmay be that I do not know all the circumstances. If they be as I have\nheard them from you, I should marry her. Good-bye. Let me hear from you,\nwhen you have settled as to going anywhere.\"\n\n\"I shall be sure to write,\" said Fred as he took the reins and seated\nhim in the phaeton.\n\nHis brother's advice he understood plainly, and that of his aunt he\nthought that he understood. But he shook his head again as he told\nhimself that he could not now be guided by either of them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nAT LISCANNOR.\n\n\nThe young lord slept one night at Ennis, and on the third morning after\nhis departure from Scroope, started in his gig for Liscannor and the\ncliffs of Moher. He took a servant with him and a change of clothes. And\nas he went his heart was very heavy. He could not live a coward in his\nown esteem. Were it not so how willingly would he have saved himself\nfrom the misery of this journey, and have sent to his Kate to bid her\ncome to him in England! He feared the priest, and he feared his Kate's\nmother;--not her dagger, but her eyes and scorching words. He altogether\ndoubted his own powers to perform satisfactorily the task before him. He\nknew men who could do it. His brother Jack would do it, were it possible\nthat his brother Jack should be in such a position. But for himself, he\nwas conscious of a softness of heart, a feminine tenderness, which,--to\ndo him justice,--he did not mistake for sincerity, that rendered him\nunfit for the task before him. The farther he journeyed from Scroope\nand the nearer that he found himself to the cliffs the stronger did\nthe feeling grow within him, till it had become almost tragical in its\ndominion over him. But still he went on. It was incumbent on him to pay\none more visit to the cliffs and he journeyed on.\n\nAt Limerick he did not even visit the barracks to see his late\ncompanions of the regiment. At Ennis he slept in his old room, and of\ncourse the two officers who were quartered there came to him. But they\nboth declared when they left him that the Earl of Scroope and Fred\nNeville were very different persons, attributing the difference solely\nto the rank and wealth of the new peer. Poor Simpkinson had expected\nlong whispered confidential conversations respecting the ladies of\nArdkill; but the Earl had barely thanked him for his journey; and the\nwhispered confidence, which would have been so delightful, was at once\nimpossible. \"By Heaven, there's nothing like rank to spoil a fellow. He\nwas a good fellow once.\" So spoke Captain Johnstone, as the two officers\nretreated together from the Earl's room.\n\nAnd the Earl also saw Mr. Crowe the attorney. Mr. Crowe recognized at\nits full weight the importance of a man whom he might now call \"My Lord\"\nas often as he pleased, and as to whose pecuniary position he had made\nsome gratifying inquiries. A very few words sufficed. Captain O'Hara\nhad taken his departure, and the money would be paid regularly. Mr.\nCrowe also noticed the stern silence of the man, but thought that it\nwas becoming in an Earl with so truly noble a property. Of the Castle\nQuin people who could hardly do more than pay their way like country\ngentlefolk, and who were mere Irish, Mr. Crowe did not think much.\n\nEvery hour that brought the lord nearer to Liscannor added a weight to\nhis bosom. As he drove his gig along the bleak road to Ennistimon his\nheart was very heavy indeed. At Maurice's mills, the only resting-place\non the road, it had been his custom to give his horse a mouthful of\nwater; but he would not do so now though the poor beast would fain\nhave stopped there. He drove the animal on ruthlessly, himself driven\nby a feeling of unrest which would not allow him to pause. He hated\nthe country now, and almost told himself that he hated all whom it\ncontained. How miserable was his lot, that he should have bound himself\nin the opening of his splendour, in the first days of a career that\nmight have been so splendid, to misfortune that was squalid and mean as\nthis. To him, to one placed by circumstances as he was placed, it was\nsqualid and mean. By a few soft words spoken to a poor girl whom he\nhad chanced to find among the rocks he had so bound himself with vile\nmanacles, had so crippled, hampered and fettered himself, that he\nwas forced to renounce all the glories of his station. Wealth almost\nunlimited was at his command,--and rank, and youth, and such personal\ngifts of appearance and disposition as best serve to win general love.\nHe had talked to his brother of his unfitness for his earldom; but he\ncould have blazoned it forth at Scroope and up in London, with the best\nof young lords, and have loved well to do so. But this adventure, as he\nhad been wont to call it, had fallen upon him, and had broken him as it\nwere in pieces. Thousands a year he would have paid to be rid of his\nadventure; but thousands a year, he knew well, were of no avail. He\nmight have sent over some English Mr. Crowe with offers almost royal;\nbut he had been able so to discern the persons concerned as to know that\nroyal offers, of which the royalty would be simply money royalty, could\nbe of no avail. How would that woman have looked at any messenger\nwho had come to her with offers of money,--and proposed to take her\nchild into some luxurious but disgraceful seclusion? And in what\nlanguage would Father Marty have expressed himself on such a proposed\narrangement? And so the Earl of Scroope drove on with his heart falling\never lower and lower within his bosom.\n\nIt had of course been necessary that he should form some plan. He\nproposed to get rooms for one night at the little inn at Ennistimon,\nto leave his gig there, and then to take one of the country cars on to\nLiscannor. It would, he thought, be best to see the priest first. Let\nhim look at his task which way he would, he found that every part of it\nwas bad. An interview with Father Marty would be very bad, for he must\ndeclare his intentions in such a way that no doubt respecting them must\nbe left on the priest's mind. He would speak only to three persons;--but\nto all those three he must now tell the certain truth. There were causes\nat work which made it impossible that Kate O'Hara should become Countess\nof Scroope. They might tear him to pieces, but from that decision he\nwould not budge. Subject to that decision they might do with him and\nwith all that belonged to him almost as they pleased. He would explain\nthis first to the priest if it should chance that he found the priest at\nhome.\n\nHe left his gig and servant at Ennistimon and proceeded as he had\nintended along the road to Liscannor on an outside car. In the\nmid-distance about two miles out of the town he met Father Marty riding\non the road. He had almost hoped,--nay, he had hoped,--that the priest\nmight not be at home. But here was the lion in his path. \"Ah, my Lord,\"\nsaid the priest in his sweetest tone of good humour,--and his tones when\nhe was so disposed were very sweet,--\"Ah, my Lord, this is a sight good\nfor sore eyes. They tould me you were to be here to-day or to-morrow,\nand I took it for granted therefore it 'd be the day afther. But you're\nas good as the best of your word.\" The Earl of Scroope got off the car,\nand holding the priest's hand, answered the kindly salutation. But he\ndid so with a constrained air and with a solemnity which the priest\nalso attributed to his newly-begotten rank. Fred Neville,--as he had\nbeen a week or two since,--was almost grovelling in the dust before\nthe priest's eyes; but the priest for the moment thought that he was\nwrapping himself up in the sables and ermine of his nobility. However,\nhe had come back,--which was more perhaps than Father Marty had\nexpected,--and the best must be made of him with reference to poor\nKate's future happiness. \"You're going on to Ardkill, I suppose, my\nLord,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes;--certainly; but I intended to take the Liscannor road on purpose\nto see you. I shall leave the car at Liscannor and walk up. You could\nnot return, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Well,--yes,--I might.\"\n\n\"If you could, Father Marty--\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly.\" The priest now saw that there was something more in the\nman's manner than lordly pride. As the Earl got again up on his car, the\npriest turned his horse, and the two travelled back through the village\nwithout further conversation. The priest's horse was given up to the boy\nin the yard, and he then led the way into the house. \"We are not much\naltered in our ways, are we, my Lord?\" he said as he moved a bottle of\nwhiskey that stood on the sideboard. \"Shall I offer you lunch?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Father Marty;--nothing, thank you.\" Then he made a gasp\nand began. The bad hour had arrived, and it must be endured. \"I have\ncome back, as you see, Father Marty. That was a matter of course.\"\n\n\"Well, yes, my Lord. As things have gone it was a matter of course.\"\n\n\"I am here. I came as soon as it was possible that I should come. Of\ncourse it was necessary that I should remain at home for some days after\nwhat has occurred at Scroope.\"\n\n\"No doubt;--no doubt. But you will not be angry with me for saying that\nafter what has occurred here, your presence has been most anxiously\nexpected. However here you are, and all may yet be well. As God's\nminister I ought perhaps to upbraid. But I am not given to much\nupbraiding, and I love that dear and innocent young face too well to\ndesire anything now but that the owner of it should receive at your\nhands that which is due to her before God and man.\"\n\nHe perceived that the priest knew it all. But how could he wonder at\nthis when that which ought to have been her secret and his had become\nknown even to Lady Mary Quin? And he understood well what the priest\nmeant when he spoke of that which was due to Kate O'Hara before God\nand man; and he could perceive, or thought that he perceived, that the\npriest did not doubt of the coming marriage, now that he, the victim,\nwas again back in the west of Ireland. And was he not the victim of a\nscheme? Had he not been allured on to make promises to the girl which\nhe would not have made had the truth been told him as to her father?\nHe would not even in his thoughts accuse Kate,--his Kate,--of being\na participator in these schemes. But Mrs. O'Hara and the priest had\ncertainly intrigued against him. He must remember that. In the terrible\ntask which he was now compelled to begin he must build his defence\nchiefly upon that. Yes; he must begin his work, now, upon the instant.\nWith all his golden prospects,--with all his golden honours already in\nhis possession,--he could wish himself dead rather than begin it. But he\ncould not die and have done it. \"Father. Marty,\" he said, \"I cannot make\nMiss O'Hara Countess of Scroope.\"\n\n\"Not make her Countess of Scroope! What will you make her then?\"\n\n\"As to that, I am here to discuss it with you.\"\n\n\"What is it you main, sir? Afther you have had your will of her, and\npolluted her sweet innocence, you will not make her your wife! You\ncannot look me in the face, Mr. Neville, and tell me that.\"\n\nThere the priest was right. The young Earl could not look him in the\nface as he stammered out his explanation and proposal. The burly, strong\nold man stood perfectly still and silent as he, with hesitating and\nill-arranged words, tried to gloze over and make endurable his past\nconduct and intentions as to the future. He still held some confused\nidea as to a form of marriage which should for all his life bind him\nto the woman, but which should give her no claim to the title, and her\nchild no claim either to the title or the property. \"You should have\ntold me of this Captain O'Hara,\" he said, as with many half-formed\nsentences he completed his suggestions.\n\n\"And it's on me you are throwing the blame?\"\n\n\"You should have told me, Father Marty.\"\n\n\"By the great God above me, I did not believe that a man could be such\na villain! As I look for glory I did not think it possible! I should\nhave tould you! Neither did I nor did Mistress O'Hara know or believe\nthat the man was alive. And what has the man to do with it? Is she vile\nbecause he has been guilty? Is she other than you knew her to be when\nyou first took her to your bosom, because of his sin?\"\n\n\"It does make a difference, Mr. Marty.\"\n\n\"Afther what you have done it can make no difference. When you swore to\nher that she should be your wife, and conquered her by so swearing, was\nthere any clause in your contract that you were not to be bound if you\nfound aught displaising to you in her parentage?\"\n\n\"I ought to have known it all.\"\n\n\"You knew all that she knew;--all that I knew. You knew all that her\nmother knew. No, Lord Scroope. It cannot be that you should be so\nunutterably a villain. You are your own masther. Unsay what you have\nsaid to me, and her ears shall never be wounded or her heart broken by\na hint of it.\"\n\n\"I cannot make her Countess of Scroope. You are a priest, and can use\nwhat words you please to me;--but I cannot make her Countess of\nScroope.\"\n\n\"Faith,--and there will be more than words used, my young lord. As to\nyour plot of a counterfeit marriage,--\"\n\n\"I said nothing of a counterfeit marriage.\"\n\n\"What was it you said, then? I say you did. You proposed to me,--to me a\npriest of God's altar,--a false counterfeit marriage, so that those two\npoor women, who you are afraid to face, might be cajoled and chaited and\nruined.\"\n\n\"I am going to face them instantly.\"\n\n\"Then must your heart be made of very stone. Shall I tell you the\nconsequences?\" Then the priest paused awhile, and the young man,\nbursting into tears, hid his face against the wall. \"I will tell you the\nconsequences, Lord Scroope. They will die. The shame and sorrow which\nyou have brought on them, will bring them to their graves,--and so there\nwill be an end of their throubles upon earth. But while I live there\nshall be no rest for the sole of your foot. I am ould, and may soon\nbe below the sod, but I will lave it as a legacy behind me that your\niniquity shall be proclaimed and made known in high places. While I live\nI will follow you, and when I am gone there shall be another to take\nthe work. My curse shall rest on you,--the curse of a man of God, and\nyou shall be accursed. Now, if it suits you, you can go up to them at\nArdkill and tell them your story. She is waiting to receive her lover.\nYou can go to her, and stab her to the heart at once. Go, sir! Unless\nyou can change all this and alter your heart even as you hear my words,\nyou are unfit to find shelter beneath my roof.\"\n\nHaving so spoken, waiting to see the effect of his indignation, the\npriest went out, and got upon his horse, and went away upon his journey.\nThe young lord knew that he had been insulted, was aware that words had\nbeen said to him so severe that one man, in his rank of life, rarely\nutters them to another; and he had stood the while with his face turned\nto the wall speechless and sobbing! The priest had gone, telling him\nto leave the house because his presence disgraced it; and he had made\nno answer. Yet he was the Earl of Scroope,--the thirteenth Earl of\nScroope,--a man in his own country full of honours. Why had he come\nthere to be called a villain? And why was the world so hard upon him\nthat on hearing himself so called he could only weep like a girl? Had he\ndone worse than other men? Was he not willing to make any retribution\nfor his fault,--except by doing that which he had been taught to think\nwould be a greater fault? As he left the house he tried to harden his\nheart against Kate O'Hara. The priest had lied to him about her father.\nThey must have known that the man was alive. They had caught him among\nthem, and the priest's anger was a part of the net with which they had\nintended to surround him. The stake for which they had played had been\nvery great. To be Countess of Scroope was indeed a chance worth some\nrisk. Then, as he breasted the hill up towards the burial ground, he\ntried to strengthen his courage by realizing the magnitude of his own\nposition. He bade himself remember that he was among people who were his\ninferiors in rank, education, wealth, manners, religion and nationality.\nHe had committed an error. Of course he had been in fault. Did he wish\nto escape the consequences of his own misdoing? Was not his presence\nthere so soon after the assumption of his family honours sufficient\nevidence of his generous admission of the claims to which he was\nsubject? Had he not offered to sacrifice himself as no other man would\nhave done? But they were still playing for the high stakes. They\nwere determined that the girl should be Countess of Scroope. He was\ndetermined that she should not be Countess of Scroope. He was still\nwilling to sacrifice himself, but his family honours he would not\npollute.\n\nAnd then as he made his way past the burial ground and on towards the\ncliff there crept over him a feeling as to the girl very different from\nthat reverential love which he had bestowed upon her when she was still\npure. He remembered the poorness of her raiment, the meekness of her\nlanguage, the small range of her ideas. The sweet soft coaxing loving\nsmile, which had once been so dear to him, was infantine and ignoble.\nShe was a plaything for an idle hour, not a woman to be taken out into\nthe world with the high name of Countess of Scroope.\n\nAll this was the antagonism in his own heart against the indignant words\nwhich the priest had spoken to him. For a moment he was so overcome\nthat he had burst into tears. But not on that account would he be beaten\naway from his decision. The priest had called him a villain and had\nthreatened and cursed him! As to the villainy he had already made up\nhis mind which way his duty lay. For the threats it did not become him\nto count them as anything. The curses were the result of the man's\nbarbarous religion. He remembered that he was the Earl of Scroope, and\nso remembering summoned up his courage as he walked on to the cottage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nAT ARDKILL.\n\n\nSharp eyes had watched for the young lord's approach. As he came near to\nthe cottage the door was opened and Kate O'Hara rushed out to meet him.\nThough his mind was turned against her,--was turned against her as hard\nand fast as all his false reasonings had been able to make it,--he could\nnot but accord to her the reception of a lover. She was in his arms and\nhe could not but press her close to his bosom. Her face was held up\nto his, and of course he covered it with kisses. She murmured to him\nsweet warm words of passionate love, and he could not but answer with\nendearing names. \"I am your own,--am I not?\" she said as she still clung\nto him. \"All my own,\" he whispered as he tightened his arm round her\nwaist.\n\nThen he asked after Mrs. O'Hara. \"Yes; mother is there. She will be\nalmost as glad to see you as I am. Nobody can be quite so glad. Oh\nFred,--my darling Fred,--am I still to call you Fred?\"\n\n\"What else, my pet?\"\n\n\"I was thinking whether I would call you--my Lord.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake do not.\"\n\n\"No. You shall be Fred,--my Fred; Fred to me, though all the world\nbesides may call you grand names.\" Then again she held up her face to\nhim and pressed the hand that was round her waist closer to her girdle.\nTo have him once more with her,--this was to taste all the joys of\nheaven while she was still on earth.\n\nThey entered the sitting-room together and met Mrs. O'Hara close to the\ndoor. \"My Lord,\" she said, \"you are very welcome back to us. Indeed we\nneed you much. I will not upbraid you as you come to make atonement for\nyour fault. If you will let me I will love you as a son.\" As she spoke\nshe held his right hand in both of hers, and then she lifted up her face\nand kissed his cheek.\n\nHe could not stay her words, nor could he refuse the kiss. And yet to\nhim the kiss was as the kiss of Judas, and the words were false words,\nplotted words, pre-arranged, so that after hearing them there should be\nno escape for him. But he would escape. He resolved again, even then,\nthat he would escape; but he could not answer her words at the moment.\nThough Mrs. O'Hara held him by the hand, Kate still hung to his other\narm. He could not thrust her away from him. She still clung to him when\nhe released his right hand, and almost lay upon his breast when he\nseated himself on the sofa. She looked into his eyes for tenderness, and\nhe could not refrain himself from bestowing upon her the happiness. \"Oh,\nmother,\" she said, \"he is so brown;--but he is handsomer than ever.\" But\nthough he smiled on her, giving back into her eyes her own soft look of\nlove, yet he must tell his tale.\n\nHe was still minded that she should have all but the one thing,--all\nif she would take it. She should not be Countess of Scroope; but in\nany other respect he would pay what penalty might be required for his\ntransgression. But in what words should he explain this to those two\nwomen? Mrs. O'Hara had called him by his title and had claimed him as\nher son. No doubt she had all the right to do so which promises made by\nhimself could give her. He had sworn that he would marry the girl, and\nin point of time had only limited his promise by the old Earl's life.\nThe old Earl was dead, and he stood pledged to the immediate performance\nof his vow,--doubly pledged if he were at all solicitous for the honour\nof his future bride. But in spite of all promises she should never be\nCountess of Scroope!\n\nSome tinkling false-tongued phrase as to lover's oaths had once passed\nacross his memory and had then sufficed to give him a grain of comfort.\nThere was no comfort to be found in it now. He began to tell himself,\nin spite of his manhood, that it might have been better for him and for\nthem that he should have broken this matter to them by a well-chosen\nmessenger. But it was too late for that now. He had faced the priest and\nhad escaped from him with the degradation of a few tears. Now he was in\nthe presence of the lioness and her young. The lioness had claimed him\nas a denizen of the forest; and, would he yield to her, she no doubt\nwould be very tender to him. But, as he was resolved not to yield, he\nbegan to find that he had been wrong to enter her den. As he looked at\nher, knowing that she was at this moment softened by false hopes, he\ncould nevertheless see in her eye the wrath of the wild animal. How was\nhe to begin to make his purpose known to them.\n\n\"And now you must tell us everything,\" said Kate, still encircled by his\narm.\n\n\"What must I tell you?\"\n\n\"You will give up the regiment at once?\"\n\n\"I have done so already.\"\n\n\"But you must not give up Ardkill;--must he, mother?\"\n\n\"He may give it up when he takes you from it, Kate.\"\n\n\"But he will take you too, mother?\"\n\nThe lioness at any rate wanted nothing for herself. \"No, love. I shall\nremain here among my rocks, and shall be happy if I hear that you are\nhappy.\"\n\n\"But you won't part us altogether,--will you, Fred?\"\n\n\"No, love.\"\n\n\"I knew he wouldn't. And mother may come to your grand house and creep\ninto some pretty little corner there, where I can go and visit her, and\ntell her that she shall always be my own, own, own darling mother.\"\n\nHe felt that he must put a stop to this in some way, though the doing\nof it would be very dreadful. Indeed in the doing of it the whole of\nhis task would consist. But still he shirked it, and used his wit in\ncontriving an answer which might still deceive without being false in\nwords. \"I think,\" said he, \"that I shall never live at any grand house,\nas you call it.\"\n\n\"Not live at Scroope?\" asked Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\"I think not. It will hardly suit me.\"\n\n\"I shall not regret it,\" said Kate. \"I care nothing for a grand house. I\nshould only be afraid of it. I know it is dark and sombre, for you have\nsaid so. Oh, Fred, any place will be Paradise to me, if I am there with\nyou.\"\n\nHe felt that every moment of existence so continued was a renewed lie.\nShe was lying in his arms, in her mother's presence, almost as his\nacknowledged wife. And she was speaking of her future home as being\ncertainly his also. But what could he do? How could he begin to tell the\ntruth? His home should be her home, if she would come to him,--not as\nhis wife. That idea of some half-valid morganatic marriage had again\nbeen dissipated by the rough reproaches of the priest, and could only be\nused as a prelude to his viler proposal. And, though he loved the girl\nafter his fashion, he desired to wound her by no such vile proposal. He\ndid not wish to live a life of sin, if such life might be avoided. If he\nmade his proposal, it would be but for her sake; or rather that he might\nshow her that he did not wish to cast her aside. It was by asserting to\nhimself that for her sake he would relinquish his own rank, were that\npossible, that he attempted to relieve his own conscience. But, in the\nmean time, she was in his arms talking about their joint future home!\n\"Where do you think of living?\" asked Mrs. O'Hara in a tone which shewed\nplainly the anxiety with which she asked the question.\n\n\"Probably abroad,\" he said.\n\n\"But mother may go with us?\" The girl felt that the tension of his arm\nwas relaxed, and she knew that all was not well with him. And if there\nwas ought amiss with him, how much more must it be amiss with her? \"What\nis it, Fred?\" she said. \"There is some secret. Will you not tell it\nto me?\" Then she whispered into his ear words intended for him alone,\nthough her mother heard them. \"If there be a secret you should tell it\nme now. Think how it is with me. Your words are life and death to me\nnow.\" He still held her with loosened arms but did not answer her. He\nsat, looking out into the middle of the room with fixed eyes, and he\nfelt that drops of perspiration were on his brow. And he knew that the\nother woman was glaring at him with the eyes of an injured lioness,\nthough he did not dare to turn his own to her face. \"Fred, tell me; tell\nme.\" And Kate rose up, with her knees upon the sofa, bending over him,\ngazing into his countenance and imploring him.\n\n\"There must be disappointment,\" he said; and he did not know the sound\nof his own voice.\n\n\"What disappointment? Speak to me. What disappointment?\"\n\n\"Disappointment!\" shrieked the mother. \"How disappointment? There shall\nbe no disappointment.\" Rising from her chair, she hurried across the\nroom, and took her girl from his arms. \"Lord Scroope, tell us what you\nmean. I say there shall be no disappointment. Sit away from him, Kate,\ntill he has told us what it is.\" Then they heard the sound of a horse's\nfoot passing close to the window, and they all knew that it was the\npriest. \"There is Father Marty,\" said Mrs. O'Hara. \"He shall make you\ntell it.\"\n\n\"I have already told him.\" Lord Scroope as he said this rose and moved\ntowards the door; but he himself was almost unconscious of the movement.\nSome idea probably crossed his mind that he would meet the priest, but\nMrs. O'Hara thought that he intended to escape from them.\n\nShe rushed between him and the door and held him with both her hands.\n\"No; no; you do not leave us in that way, though you were twice an\nEarl.\"\n\n\"I am not thinking of leaving you.\"\n\n\"Mother, you shall not hurt him; you shall not insult him,\" said the\ngirl. \"He does not mean to harm me. He is my own, and no one shall touch\nhim.\"\n\n\"Certainly I will not harm you. Here is Father Marty. Mrs. O'Hara you\nhad better be tranquil. You should remember that you have heard nothing\nyet of what I would say to you.\"\n\n\"Whose fault is that? Why do you not speak? Father Marty, what does he\nmean when he tells my girl that there must be disappointment for her?\nDoes he dare to tell me that he hesitates to make her his wife?\"\n\nThe priest took the mother by the hand and placed her on the chair in\nwhich she usually sat. Then, almost without a word, he led Kate from the\nroom to her own chamber, and bade her wait a minute till he should come\nback to her. Then he returned to the sitting-room and at once addressed\nhimself to Lord Scroope. \"Have you dared,\" he said, \"to tell them what\nyou hardly dared to tell to me?\"\n\n\"He has dared to tell us nothing,\" said Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\"I do not wonder at it. I do not think that any man could say to her\nthat which he told me that he would do.\"\n\n\"Mrs. O'Hara,\" said the young lord, with some return of courage now\nthat the girl had left them, \"that which I told Mr. Marty this morning,\nI will now tell to you. For your daughter I will do anything that you\nand she and he may wish,--but one thing. I cannot make her Countess of\nScroope.\"\n\n\"You must make her your wife,\" said the woman, shouting at him.\n\n\"I will do so to-morrow if a way can be found by which she shall not\nbecome Countess of Scroope.\"\n\n\"That is, he will marry her without making her his wife,\" said the\npriest. \"He will jump over a broomstick with her and will ask me to help\nhim,--so that your feelings and hers may be spared for a week or so.\nMrs. O'Hara, he is a villain,--a vile, heartless, cowardly reprobate, so\nlow in the scale of humanity that I degrade myself by spaking to him. He\ncalls himself an English peer! Peer to what? Certainly to no one worthy\nto be called a man!\" So speaking, the priest addressed himself to Mrs.\nO'Hara, but as he spoke his eyes were fixed full on the face of the\nyoung lord.\n\n\"I will have his heart out of his body,\" exclaimed Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\"Heart;--he has no heart. You may touch his pocket;--or his pride,\nwhat he calls his pride, a damnable devilish inhuman vanity; or his\nname,--that bugbear of a title by which he trusts to cover his baseness;\nor his skin, for he is a coward. Do you see his cheek now? But as for\nhis heart,--you cannot get at that.\"\n\n\"I will get at his life,\" said the woman.\n\n\"Mr. Marty, you allow yourself a liberty of speech which even your\npriesthood will not warrant.\"\n\n\"Lay a hand upon me if you can. There is not blood enough about you to\ndo it. Were it not that the poor child has been wake and too trusting, I\nwould bid her spit on you rather than take you for her husband.\" Then he\npaused, but only for a moment. \"Sir, you must marry her, and there must\nbe an end of it. In no other way can you be allowed to live.\"\n\n\"Would you murder me?\"\n\n\"I would crush you like an insect beneath my nail. Murder you! Have you\nthought what murder is;--that there are more ways of murder than one?\nHave you thought of the life of that young girl who now bears in her\nwomb the fruit of your body? Would you murder her,--because she loved\nyou, and trusted you, and gave you all simply because you asked her; and\nthen think of your own life? As the God of Heaven is above me, and sees\nme now, and the Saviour in whose blood I trust, I would lay down my life\nthis instant, if I could save her from your heartlessness.\" So saying he\ntoo turned away his face and wept like a child.\n\nAfter this the priest was gentler in his manner to the young man, and\nit almost seemed as though the Earl was driven from his decision. He\nceased, at any rate, to assert that Kate should never be Countess of\nScroope, and allowed both the mother and Father Marty to fall into a\nstate of doubt as to what his last resolve might be. It was decided that\nhe should go down to Ennistimon and sleep upon it. On the morrow he\nwould come up again, and in the meantime he would see Father Marty at\nthe inn. There were many prayers addressed to him both by the mother and\nthe priest, and such arguments used that he had been almost shaken. \"But\nyou will come to-morrow?\" said the mother, looking at the priest as she\nspoke.\n\n\"I will certainly come to-morrow.\"\n\n\"No doubt he will come to-morrow,\" said Father Marty,--who intended\nto imply that if Lord Scroope escaped out of Ennistimon without his\nknowledge, he would be very much surprised.\n\n\"Shall I not say a word to Kate?\" the Earl asked as he was going.\n\n\"Not till you are prepared to tell her that she shall be your wife,\"\nsaid the priest.\n\nBut this was a matter as to which Kate herself had a word to say. When\nthey were in the passage she came out from her room, and again rushed\ninto her lover's arms. \"Oh, Fred, let me told,--let me told. I will go\nwith you anywhere if you will take me.\"\n\n\"He is to come up to-morrow, Kate,\" said her mother.\n\n\"He will be here early to-morrow, and everything shall be settled then,\"\nsaid the priest, trying to assume a happy and contented tone.\n\n\"Dearest Kate, I will be here by noon,\" said Lord Scroope, returning the\ngirl's caresses.\n\n\"And you will not desert me?\"\n\n\"No, darling, no.\" And then he went, leaving the priest behind him at\nthe cottage.\n\nFather Marty was to be with him at the inn by eight, and then the whole\nmatter must be again discussed. He felt that he had been very weak, that\nhe had made no use,--almost no use at all,--of the damning fact of the\nCaptain's existence. He had allowed the priest to talk him down in every\nargument, and had been actually awed by the girl's mother, and yet he\nwas determined that he would not yield. He felt more strongly than ever,\nnow that he had again seen Kate O'Hara, that it would not be right that\nsuch a one as she should be made Countess of Scroope. Not only would she\ndisgrace the place, but she would be unhappy in it, and would shame him.\nAfter all the promises that he had made he could not, and he would not,\ntake her to Scroope as his wife. How could she hold up her head before\nsuch women as Sophie Mellerby and others like her? It would be known by\nall his friends that he had been taken in and swindled by low people\nin the County Clare, and he would be regarded by all around him as\none who had absolutely ruined himself. He had positively resolved that\nshe should not be Countess of Scroope, and to that resolution he would\nadhere. The foul-mouthed priest had called him a coward, but he would\nbe no coward. The mother had said that she would have his life. If\nthere were danger in that respect he must encounter it. As he returned\nto Ennistimon he again determined that Kate O'Hara should never become\nCountess of Scroope.\n\nFor three hours Father Marty remained with him that night, but did not\nshake him. He had now become accustomed to the priest's wrath and could\nendure it. And he thought also that he could now endure the mother. The\ntears of the girl and her reproaches he still did fear.\n\n\"I will do anything that you can dictate short of that,\" he said again\nto Father Marty.\n\n\"Anything but the one thing that you have sworn to do?\"\n\n\"Anything but the one thing that I have sworn not to do.\" For he had\ntold the priest of the promises he had made both to his uncle and to his\nuncle's widow.\n\n\"Then,\" said the priest, as he crammed his hat on his head, and shook\nthe dust off his feet, \"if I were you I would not go to Ardkill\nto-morrow if I valued my life.\" Nevertheless Father Marty slept at\nEnnistimon that night, and was prepared to bar the way if any attempt\nat escape were made.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nON THE CLIFFS.\n\n\nNo attempt at escape was made. The Earl breakfasted by himself at about\nnine, and then lighting a cigar, roamed about for a while round the Inn,\nthinking of the work that was now before him. He saw nothing of Father\nMarty though he knew that the priest was still in Ennistimon. And he\nfelt that he was watched. They might have saved themselves that trouble,\nfor he certainly had no intention of breaking his word to them. So he\ntold himself, thinking as he did so, that people such as these could\nnot understand that an Earl of Scroope would not be untrue to his word.\nAnd yet since he had been back in County Clare he had almost regretted\nthat he had not broken his faith to them and remained in England.\nAt half-past ten he started on a car, having promised to be at the\ncottage at noon, and he told his servant that he should certainly leave\nEnnistimon that day at three. The horse and gig were to be ready for him\nexactly at that hour.\n\nOn this occasion he did not go through Liscannor, but took the other\nroad to the burial ground. There he left his car and slowly walked\nalong the cliffs till he came to the path leading down from them to the\ncottage. In doing this he went somewhat out of his way, but he had time\non his hands and he did not desire to be at the cottage before the hour\nhe had named. It was a hot midsummer day, and there seemed to be hardly\na ripple on the waves. The tide was full in, and he sat for a while\nlooking down upon the blue waters. What an ass had he made himself,\ncoming thither in quest of adventures! He began to see now the meaning\nof such idleness of purpose as that to which he had looked for pleasure\nand excitement. Even the ocean itself and the very rocks had lost their\ncharm for him. It was all one blaze of blue light, the sky above and\nthe water below, in which there was neither beauty nor variety. How\npoor had been the life he had chosen! He had spent hour after hour in a\ncomfortless dirty boat, in company with a wretched ignorant creature, in\norder that he might shoot a few birds and possibly a seal. All the world\nhad been open to him, and yet how miserable had been his ambition! And\nnow he could see no way out of the ruin he had brought upon himself.\n\nWhen the time had come he rose from his seat and took the path down to\nthe cottage. At the corner of the little patch of garden ground attached\nto it he met Mrs. O'Hara. Her hat was on her head, and a light shawl\nwas on her shoulders as though she had prepared herself for walking.\nHe immediately asked after Kate. She told him that Kate was within and\nshould see him presently. Would it not be better that they two should go\nup on the cliffs together, and then say what might be necessary for the\nmutual understanding of their purposes? \"There should be no talking of\nall this before Kate,\" said Mrs. O'Hara.\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"You can imagine what she must feel if she is told to doubt. Lord\nScroope, will you not say at once that there shall be no doubt? You must\nnot ruin my child in return for her love!\"\n\n\"If there must be ruin I would sooner bear it myself,\" said he. And then\nthey walked on without further speech till they had reached a point\nsomewhat to the right, and higher than that on which he had sat before.\nIt had ever been a favourite spot with her, and he had often sat there\nbetween the mother and daughter. It was almost the summit of the cliff,\nbut there was yet a higher pitch which screened it from the north, so\nthat the force of the wind was broken. The fall from it was almost\nprecipitous to the ocean, so that the face of the rocks immediately\nbelow was not in view; but there was a curve here in the line of the\nshore, and a little bay in the coast, which exposed to view the whole\nside of the opposite cliff, so that the varying colours of the rocks\nmight be seen. The two ladies had made a seat upon the turf, by moving\nthe loose stones and levelling the earth around, so that they could sit\nsecurely on the very edge. Many many hours had Mrs. O'Hara passed upon\nthe spot, both summer and winter, watching the sunset in the west, and\nlistening to the screams of the birds. \"There are no gulls now,\" she\nsaid as she seated herself,--as though for a moment she had forgotten\nthe great subject which filled her mind.\n\n\"No;--they never show themselves in weather like this. They only come\nwhen the wind blows. I wonder where they go when the sun shines.\"\n\n\"They are just the opposite to men and women who only come around you\nin fine weather. How hot it is!\" and she threw her shawl back from her\nshoulders.\n\n\"Yes, indeed. I walked up from the burial ground and I found that it was\nvery hot. Have you seen Father Marty this morning?\"\n\n\"No. Have you?\" she asked the question turning upon him very shortly.\n\n\"Not to-day. He was with me till late last night.\"\n\n\"Well.\" He did not answer her. He had nothing to say to her. In fact\neverything had been said yesterday. If she had questions to ask he would\nanswer them. \"What did you settle last night? When he went from me an\nhour after you were gone, he said that it was impossible that you should\nmean to destroy her.\"\n\n\"God forbid that I should destroy her.\"\n\n\"He said that,--that you were afraid of her father.\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"And of me.\"\n\n\"No;--not of you, Mrs. O'Hara.\"\n\n\"Listen to me. He said that such a one as you cannot endure the presence\nof an uneducated and ill-mannered mother-in-law. Do not interrupt me,\nLord Scroope. If you will marry her, my girl shall never see my face\nagain; and I will cling to that man and will not leave him for a moment,\nso that he shall never put his foot near your door. Our name shall never\nbe spoken in your hearing. She shall never even write to me if you think\nit better that we shall be so separated.\"\n\n\"It is not that,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. O'Hara, you do not understand. You,--you I could love dearly.\"\n\n\"I would have you keep all your love for her.\"\n\n\"I do love her. She is good enough for me. She is too good; and so are\nyou. It is for the family, and not for myself.\"\n\n\"How will she harm the family?\"\n\n\"I swore to my uncle that I would not make her Countess of Scroope.\"\n\n\"And have you not sworn to her again and again that she should be your\nwife? Do you think that she would have done for you what she has done,\nhad you not so sworn? Lord Scroope, I cannot think that you really mean\nit.\" She put both her hands softly upon his arm and looked up to him\nimploring his mercy.\n\nHe got up from his seat and roamed along the cliff, and she followed\nhim, still imploring. Her tones were soft, and her words were the\nwords of a suppliant. Would he not relent and save her child from\nwretchedness, from ruin and from death. \"I will keep her with me till\nI die,\" he said.\n\n\"But not as your wife?\"\n\n\"She shall have all attention from me,--everything that a woman's heart\ncan desire. You two shall be never separated.\"\n\n\"But not as your wife?\"\n\n\"I will live where she and you may please. She shall want nothing that\nmy wife would possess.\"\n\n\"But not as your wife?\"\n\n\"Not as Countess of Scroope.\"\n\n\"You would have her as your mistress, then?\" As she asked this question\nthe tone of her voice was altogether altered, and the threatening\nlion-look had returned to her eyes. They were now near the seat,\nconfronted to each other; and the fury of her bosom, which for a while\nhad been dominated by the tenderness of the love for her daughter, was\nagain raging within her. Was it possible that he should be able to treat\nthem thus,--that he should break his word and go from them scathless,\nhappy, joyous, with all the delights of the world before him, leaving\nthem crushed into dust beneath his feet. She had been called upon from\nher youth upwards to bear injustice,--but of all injustice surely this\nwould be the worst. \"As your mistress,\" she repeated,--\"and I her\nmother, am to stand by and see it, and know that my girl is dishonoured!\nWould your mother have borne that for your sister? How would it be if\nyour sister were as that girl is now?\"\n\n\"I have no sister.\"\n\n\"And therefore you are thus hard-hearted. She shall never be your\nharlot;--never. I would myself sooner take from her the life I gave her.\nYou have destroyed her, but she shall never be a thing so low as that.\"\n\n\"I will marry her,--in a foreign land.\"\n\n\"And why not here? She is as good as you. Why should she not bear the\nname you are so proud of dinning into our ears? Why should she not be a\nCountess? Has she ever disgraced herself? If she is disgraced in your\neyes you must be a Devil.\"\n\n\"It is not that,\" he said hoarsely.\n\n\"What is it? What has she done that she should be thus punished? Tell\nme, man, that she shall be your lawful wife.\" As she said this she\ncaught him roughly by the collar of his coat and shook him with her arm.\n\n\"It cannot be so,\" said the Earl Of Scroope.\n\n\"It cannot be so! But I say it shall,--or,--or--! What are you, that\nshe should be in your hands like this? Say that she shall be your wife,\nor you shall never live to speak to another woman.\" The peril of his\nposition on the top of the cliff had not occurred to him;--nor did it\noccur to him now. He had been there so often that the place gave him no\nsense of danger. Nor had that peril,--as it was thought afterwards by\nthose who most closely made inquiry on the matter,--ever occurred to\nher. She had not brought him there that she might frighten him with\nthat danger, or that she might avenge herself by the power which it gave\nher. But now the idea flashed across her maddened mind. \"Miscreant,\" she\nsaid. And she bore him back to the very edge of the precipice.\n\n\"You'll have me over the cliff,\" he exclaimed hardly even yet putting\nout his strength against her.\n\n\"And so I will, by the help of God. Now think of her! Now think of her!\"\nAnd as she spoke she pressed him backwards towards his fall. He had\npower enough to bend his knee, and to crouch beneath her grasp on to the\nloose crumbling soil of the margin of the rocks. He still held her by\nher cuff and it seemed for a moment as though she must go with him. But,\non a sudden, she spurned him with her foot on the breast, the rag of\ncloth parted in his hand, and the poor wretch tumbled forth alone into\neternity.\n\nThat was the end of Frederic Neville, Earl of Scroope, and the end, too,\nof all that poor girl's hopes in this world. When you stretch yourself\non the edge of those cliffs and look down over the abyss on the sea\nbelow it seems as though the rocks were so absolutely perpendicular,\nthat a stone dropped with an extended hand would fall amidst the waves.\nBut in such measurement the eye deceives itself, for the rocks in truth\nslant down; and the young man, as he fell, struck them again and again;\nand at last it was a broken mangled corpse that reached the blue waters\nbelow.\n\nHer Kate was at last avenged. The woman stood there in her solitude for\nsome minutes thinking of the thing she had done. The man had injured\nher,--sorely,--and she had punished him. He had richly deserved the\ndeath which he had received from her hands. In these minutes, as\nregarded him, there was no remorse. But how should she tell the news\nto her child? The blow which had thrust him over would, too probably,\ndestroy other life than his. Would it not be better that her girl should\nso die? What could prolonged life give her that would be worth her\nhaving? As for herself,--in these first moments of her awe she took no\nthought of her own danger. It did not occur to her that she might tell\nhow the man had ventured too near the edge and had fallen by mischance.\nAs regarded herself she was proud of the thing she had accomplished; but\nhow should she tell her child that it was done?\n\nShe slowly took the path, not to the cottage, but down towards the\nburial ground and Liscannor, passing the car which was waiting in vain\nfor the young lord. On she walked with rapid step, indifferent to the\nheat, still proud of what she had done,--raging with a maddened pride.\nHow little had they two asked of the world! And then this man had come\nto them and robbed them of all that little, had spoiled them ruthlessly,\ncheating them with lies, and then excusing himself by the grandeur of\nhis blood! During that walk it was that she first repeated to herself\nthe words that were ever afterwards on her tongue; An Eye for an Eye.\nWas not that justice? And, had she not taken the eye herself, would any\nCourt in the world have given it to her? Yes;--an eye for an eye! Death\nin return for ruin! One destruction for another! The punishment had been\njust. An eye for an eye! Let the Courts of the world now say what they\npleased, they could not return to his earldom the man who had plundered\nand spoiled her child. He had sworn that he would not make her Kate\nCountess of Scroope! Nor should he make any other woman a Countess!\n\nRapidly she went down by the burying ground, and into the priest's\nhouse. Father Marty was there, and she stalked at once into his\npresence. \"Ha;--Mrs. O'Hara! And where is Lord Scroope?\"\n\n\"There,\" she said, pointing out towards the ocean. \"Under the rocks!\"\n\n\"He has fallen!\"\n\n\"I thrust him down with my hands and with my feet.\" As she said this,\nshe used her hand and her foot as though she were now using her strength\nto push the man over the edge. \"Yes, I thrust him down, and he fell\nsplashing into the waves. I heard it as his body struck the water. He\nwill shoot no more of the sea-gulls now.\"\n\n\"You do not mean that you have murdered him?\"\n\n\"You may call it murder if you please, Father Marty. An eye for an eye,\nFather Marty! It is justice, and I have done it. An Eye for an Eye!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n\nThe story of the poor mad woman who still proclaims in her seclusion the\njustice of the deed which she did, has now been told. It may perhaps be\nwell to collect the scattered ends of the threads of the tale for the\nbenefit of readers who desire to know the whole of a history.\n\nMrs. O'Hara never returned to the cottage on the cliffs after the\nperpetration of the deed. On the unhappy priest devolved the duty of\ndoing whatever must be done. The police at the neighbouring barracks\nwere told that the young lord had perished by a fall from the cliffs,\nand by them search was made for the body. No real attempt was set on\nfoot to screen the woman who had done the deed by any concealment of the\nfacts. She herself was not alive to the necessity of making any such\nattempt. \"An eye for an eye!\" she said to the head-constable when the\nman interrogated her. It soon became known to all Liscannor, to\nEnnistimon, to the ladies at Castle Quin, and to all the barony of\nCorcomroe that Mrs. O'Hara had thrust the Earl of Scroope over the\ncliffs of Moher, and that she was now detained at the house of Father\nMarty in the custody of a policeman. Before the day was over it was\ndeclared also that she was mad,--and that her daughter was dying.\n\nThe deed which the woman had done and the death of the young lord were\nboth terrible to Father Marty; but there was a duty thrown upon him more\nawful to his mind even than these. Kate O'Hara, when her mother\nappeared at the priest's house, had been alone at the cottage. By\ndegrees Father Marty learned from the wretched woman something of the\ncircumstances of that morning's work. Kate had not seen her lover that\nday, but had been left in the cottage while her mother went out to meet\nthe man, and if possible to persuade him to do her child justice. The\npriest understood that she would be waiting for them,--or more probably\nsearching for them on the cliffs. He got upon his horse and rode up the\nhill with a heavy heart. What should he tell her; and how should he tell\nit?\n\nBefore he reached the cottage she came running down the hillside to him.\n\"Father Marty, where is mother? Where is Mr. Neville? You know. I see\nthat you know. Where are they?\" He got off his horse and put his arm\nround her body and seated her beside himself on the rising bank by the\nwayside. \"Why don't you speak?\" she said.\n\n\"I cannot speak,\" he murmured. \"I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"Is he--dead?\" He only buried his face in his hands. \"She has killed\nhim! Mother--mother!\" Then, with one loud long wailing shriek, she fell\nupon the ground.\n\nNot for a month after that did she know anything of what happened around\nher. But yet it seemed that during that time her mind had not been\naltogether vacant, for when she awoke to self-consciousness, she knew at\nleast that her lover was dead. She had been taken into Ennistimon and\nthere, under the priest's care, had been tended with infinite\nsolicitude; but almost with a hope on his part that nature might give\nway and that she might die. Overwhelmed as she was with sorrows past and\nto come would it not be better for her that she should go hence and be\nno more seen? But as Death cannot be barred from the door when he knocks\nat it, so neither can he be made to come as a guest when summoned. She\nstill lived, though life had so little to offer to her.\n\nBut Mrs. O'Hara never saw her child again. With passionate entreaties\nshe begged of the police that her girl might be brought to her, that she\nmight be allowed if it were only to see her face or to touch her hand.\nHer entreaties to the priest, who was constant in his attendance upon\nher in the prison to which she was removed from his house, were\npiteous,--almost heartbreaking. But the poor girl, though she was meek,\nsilent, and almost apathetic in her tranquillity, could not even bear\nthe mention of her mother's name. Her mother had destroyed the father of\nthe child that was to be born to her, her lover, her hero, her god; and\nin her remembrance of the man who had betrayed her, she learned to\nexecrate the mother who had sacrificed everything,--her very reason,--in\navenging the wrongs of her child!\n\nMrs. O'Hara was taken away from the priest's house to the County Gaol,\nbut was then in a condition of acknowledged insanity. That she had\ncommitted the murder no one who heard the story doubted, but of her\nguilt there was no evidence whatever beyond the random confession of a\nmaniac. No detailed confession was ever made by her. \"An eye for an\neye,\" she would say when interrogated,--\"Is not that justice? A tooth\nfor a tooth!\" Though she was for a while detained in prison it was\nimpossible to prosecute her,--even with a view to an acquittal on the\nground of insanity; and while the question was under discussion among\nthe lawyers, provision for her care and maintenance came from another\nsource.\n\nAs also it did for the poor girl. For a while everything was done for\nher under the care of Father Marty;--but there was another Earl of\nScroope in the world, and as soon as the story was known to him and the\ncircumstances had been made clear, he came forward to offer on behalf of\nthe family whatever assistance might now avail them anything. As months\nrolled on the time of Kate O'Hara's further probation came, but Fate\nspared her the burden and despair of a living infant. It was at last\nthought better that she should go to her father and live in France with\nhim, reprobate though the man was. The priest offered to find a home for\nher in his own house at Liscannor; but, as he said himself, he was an\nold man, and one who when he went would leave no home behind him. And\nthen it was felt that the close vicinity of the spot on which her lover\nhad perished would produce a continued melancholy that might crush her\nspirits utterly. Captain O'Hara therefore was desired to come and fetch\nhis child,--and he did so, with many protestations of virtue for the\nfuture. If actual pecuniary comfort can conduce to virtue in such a man,\na chance was given him. The Earl of Scroope was only too liberal in the\nsettlement he made. But the settlement was on the daughter and not on\nthe father; and it is possible therefore that some gentle restraint may\nhave served to keep him out of the deep abysses of wickedness.\n\nThe effects of the tragedy on the coast of Clare spread beyond Ireland,\nand drove another woman to the verge of insanity. When the Countess of\nScroope heard the story, she shut herself up at Scroope and would see no\none but her own servants. When the succeeding Earl came to the house\nwhich was now his own, she refused to admit him into her presence, and\ndeclined even a renewed visit from Miss Mellerby who at that time had\nreturned to her father's roof. At last the clergyman of Scroope\nprevailed, and to him she unburdened her soul,--acknowledging, with an\nenergy that went perhaps beyond the truth, the sin of her own conduct in\nproducing the catastrophe which had occurred. \"I knew that he had\nwronged her, and yet I bade him not to make her his wife.\" That was the\ngist of her confession and she declared that the young man's blood would\nbe on her hands till she died. A small cottage was prepared for her on\nthe estate, and there she lived in absolute seclusion till death\nrelieved her from her sorrows.\n\nAnd she lived not only in seclusion, but in solitude almost to her\ndeath. It was not till four years after the occurrences which have been\nhere related that John fourteenth Earl of Scroope brought a bride home\nto Scroope Manor. The reader need hardly be told that that bride was\nSophie Mellerby. When the young Countess came to live at the Manor the\nold Countess admitted her visits and at last found some consolation in\nher friend's company. But it lasted not long, and then she was taken\naway and buried beside her lord in the chancel of the parish church.\n\nWhen it was at last decided that the law should not interfere at all as\nto the personal custody of the poor maniac who had sacrificed everything\nto avenge her daughter, the Earl of Scroope selected for her comfort the\nasylum in which she still continues to justify from morning to night,\nand, alas, often all the night long, the terrible deed of which she is\never thinking. \"An eye for an eye,\" she says to the woman who watches\nher.\n\n\"Oh, yes, ma'am; certainly.\"\n\n\"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/about\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":415,"split":"train"}
