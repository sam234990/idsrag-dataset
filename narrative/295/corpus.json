Seeking a place in society, Miss Mackenzie moves to a town called Littlebath, (modeled after Bath, Somerset), and joins a group of Evangelicals centered around the popular local pastor Mr. Stumfold and his wife. At Littlebath she meets three men who are interested in marrying her. One is Samuel Rubb, the business partner of her surviving brother, Tom Mackenzie; another is Mr. Maguire, Mr. Stumfold's curate; and the third is her cousin, Mr. John Ball.\nShe is soon asked by Mr. Rubb to loan him and her brother 2,500 pounds for business purposes, a deal that turns out badly. Mr. Rubb admits that he has cheated Miss Mackenzie, but his honesty in telling her the truth about his actions allows him to remain a friend and prospective husband. She is invited for a short stay with the Ball family, and while there refuses a marriage proposal from Mr. John Ball. Mr. Maguire asks Miss Mackenzie to marry him when she returns to Littlebath, but she is forced to put him off after finding out that her brother Tom is dying and that she must go to him in London. While in London she refuses Mr. Maguire by letter.\nAfter Tom's death, Miss Mackenzie finds out that there is a problem with her brother Walter's will, and that Mr. John Ball may be the rightful inheritor of the money. He asks her to marry him again while the legal issues are being dealt with by their respective lawyers, and she accepts him. Mr. Maguire interferes with Mr. John Ball, libeling him in an Evangelical newspaper, and visiting London to try to get Miss Mackenzie to marry him instead. The courts eventually decide in favor of Mr. John Ball, who soon becomes Sir John Ball after his father's death. Over objections from his mother, Lady Ball, Sir John and Miss Mackenzie are married and Mr. Maguire is forced to give up his own attempts. Mr. Rubb marries a lodger in Tom Mackenzie's old house, Miss Corza, and Mr. Maguire finds a wife and a new position.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Miss Mackenzie, by Anthony Trollope\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Conclusion\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nThe Mackenzie Family\n\n\nI fear I must trouble my reader with some few details as to the early\nlife of Miss Mackenzie,--details which will be dull in the telling,\nbut which shall be as short as I can make them. Her father, who had\nin early life come from Scotland to London, had spent all his days in\nthe service of his country. He became a clerk in Somerset House at\nthe age of sixteen, and was a clerk in Somerset House when he died at\nthe age of sixty. Of him no more shall be said than that his wife had\ndied before him, and that he, at dying, left behind him two sons and\na daughter.\n\nThomas Mackenzie, the eldest of those two sons, had engaged himself\nin commercial pursuits--as his wife was accustomed to say when she\nspoke of her husband's labours; or went into trade, and kept a shop,\nas was more generally asserted by those of the Mackenzie circle who\nwere wont to speak their minds freely. The actual and unvarnished\ntruth in the matter shall now be made known. He, with his partner,\nmade and sold oilcloth, and was possessed of premises in the New\nRoad, over which the names of \"Rubb and Mackenzie\" were posted in\nlarge letters. As you, my reader, might enter therein, and purchase\na yard and a half of oilcloth, if you were so minded, I think that\nthe free-spoken friends of the family were not far wrong. Mrs Thomas\nMackenzie, however, declared that she was calumniated, and her\nhusband cruelly injured; and she based her assertions on the fact\nthat \"Rubb and Mackenzie\" had wholesale dealings, and that they sold\ntheir article to the trade, who re-sold it. Whether or no she was\nill-treated in the matter, I will leave my readers to decide, having\ntold them all that it is necessary for them to know, in order that a\njudgement may be formed.\n\nWalter Mackenzie, the second son, had been placed in his father's\noffice, and he also had died before the time at which our story is\nsupposed to commence. He had been a poor sickly creature, always\nailing, gifted with an affectionate nature, and a great respect for\nthe blood of the Mackenzies, but not gifted with much else that was\nintrinsically his own. The blood of the Mackenzies was, according to\nhis way of thinking, very pure blood indeed; and he had felt strongly\nthat his brother had disgraced the family by connecting himself with\nthat man Rubb, in the New Road. He had felt this the more strongly,\nseeing that \"Rubb and Mackenzie\" had not done great things in their\ntrade. They had kept their joint commercial head above water, but\nhad sometimes barely succeeded in doing that. They had never been\nbankrupt, and that, perhaps, for some years was all that could be\nsaid. If a Mackenzie did go into trade, he should, at any rate, have\ndone better than this. He certainly should have done better than\nthis, seeing that he started in life with a considerable sum of\nmoney.\n\nOld Mackenzie,--he who had come from Scotland,--had been the\nfirst-cousin of Sir Walter Mackenzie, baronet, of Incharrow, and\nhe had married the sister of Sir John Ball, baronet, of the Cedars,\nTwickenham. The young Mackenzies, therefore, had reason to be proud\nof their blood. It is true that Sir John Ball was the first baronet,\nand that he had simply been a political Lord Mayor in strong\npolitical days,--a political Lord Mayor in the leather business; but,\nthen, his business had been undoubtedly wholesale; and a man who gets\nhimself to be made a baronet cleanses himself from the stains of\ntrade, even though he have traded in leather. And then, the present\nMackenzie baronet was the ninth of the name; so that on the higher\nand nobler side of the family, our Mackenzies may be said to have\nbeen very strong indeed. This strength the two clerks in Somerset\nHouse felt and enjoyed very keenly; and it may therefore be\nunderstood that the oilcloth manufactory was much out of favour with\nthem.\n\nWhen Tom Mackenzie was twenty-five--\"Rubb and Mackenzie\" as he\nafterwards became--and Walter, at the age of twenty-one, had been\nfor a year or two placed at a desk in Somerset House, there died one\nJonathan Ball, a brother of the baronet Ball, leaving all he had in\nthe world to the two brother Mackenzies. This all was by no means a\ntrifle, for each brother received about twelve thousand pounds when\nthe opposing lawsuits instituted by the Ball family were finished.\nThese opposing lawsuits were carried on with great vigour, but with\nno success on the Ball side, for three years. By that time, Sir John\nBall, of the Cedars, was half ruined, and the Mackenzies got their\nmoney. It is needless to say much to the reader of the manner in\nwhich Tom Mackenzie found his way into trade--how, in the first\nplace, he endeavoured to resume his Uncle Jonathan's share in the\nleather business, instigated thereto by a desire to oppose his Uncle\nJohn,--Sir John, who was opposing him in the matter of the will,--how\nhe lost money in this attempt, and ultimately embarked, after\nsome other fruitless speculations, the residue of his fortune in\npartnership with Mr Rubb. All that happened long ago. He was now a\nman of nearly fifty, living with his wife and family,--a family of\nsix or seven children,--in a house in Gower Street, and things had\nnot gone with him very well.\n\nNor is it necessary to say very much of Walter Mackenzie, who had\nbeen four years younger than his brother. He had stuck to the office\nin spite of his wealth; and as he had never married, he had been\na rich man. During his father's lifetime, and when he was quite\nyoung, he had for a while shone in the world of fashion, having been\npatronised by the Mackenzie baronet, and by others who thought that a\nclerk from Somerset House with twelve thousand pounds must be a very\nestimable fellow. He had not, however, shone in a very brilliant way.\nHe had gone to parties for a year or two, and during those years had\nessayed the life of a young man about town, frequenting theatres and\nbilliard-rooms, and doing a few things which he should have left\nundone, and leaving undone a few things which should not have been\nso left. But, as I have said, he was weak in body as well as weak\nin mind. Early in life he became an invalid; and though he kept his\nplace in Somerset House till he died, the period of his shining in\nthe fashionable world came to a speedy end.\n\nNow, at length, we will come to Margaret Mackenzie, the sister, our\nheroine, who was eight years younger than her brother Walter, and\ntwelve years younger than Mr Rubb's partner. She had been little more\nthan a child when her father died; or I might more correctly say,\nthat though she had then reached an age which makes some girls young\nwomen, it had not as yet had that effect upon her. She was then\nnineteen; but her life in her father's house had been dull and\nmonotonous; she had gone very little into company, and knew very\nlittle of the ways of the world. The Mackenzie baronet people had not\nnoticed her. They had failed to make much of Walter with his twelve\nthousand pounds, and did not trouble themselves with Margaret, who\nhad no fortune of her own. The Ball baronet people were at extreme\nvariance with all her family, and, as a matter of course, she\nreceived no countenance from them. In those early days she did not\nreceive much countenance from any one; and perhaps I may say that she\nhad not shown much claim for such countenance as is often given to\nyoung ladies by their richer relatives. She was neither beautiful\nnor clever, nor was she in any special manner made charming by any\nof those softnesses and graces of youth which to some girls seem to\natone for a want of beauty and cleverness. At the age of nineteen,\nI may almost say that Margaret Mackenzie was ungainly. Her brown\nhair was rough, and did not form itself into equal lengths. Her\ncheek-bones were somewhat high, after the manner of the Mackenzies.\nShe was thin and straggling in her figure, with bones larger than\nthey should have been for purposes of youthful grace. There was\nnot wanting a certain brightness to her grey eyes, but it was a\nbrightness as to the use of which she had no early knowledge. At\nthis time her father lived at Camberwell, and I doubt whether the\neducation which Margaret received at Miss Green's establishment for\nyoung ladies in that suburb was of a kind to make up by art for that\nwhich nature had not given her. This school, too, she left at an\nearly age--at a very early age, as her age went. When she was nearly\nsixteen, her father, who was then almost an old man, became ill, and\nthe next three years she spent in nursing him. When he died, she was\ntransferred to her younger brother's house,--to a house which he had\ntaken in one of the quiet streets leading down from the Strand to\nthe river, in order that he might be near his office. And here for\nfifteen years she had lived, eating his bread and nursing him, till\nhe also died, and so she was alone in the world.\n\nDuring those fifteen years her life had been very weary. A moated\ngrange in the country is bad enough for the life of any Mariana, but\na moated grange in town is much worse. Her life in London had been\naltogether of the moated grange kind, and long before her brother's\ndeath it had been very wearisome to her. I will not say that she\nwas always waiting for some one that came not, or that she declared\nherself to be aweary, or that she wished that she were dead. But the\nmode of her life was as near that as prose may be near to poetry, or\ntruth to romance. For the coming of one, who, as things fell out in\nthat matter, soon ceased to come at all to her, she had for a while\nbeen anxious. There was a young clerk then in Somerset House, one\nHarry Handcock by name, who had visited her brother in the early days\nof that long sickness. And Harry Handcock had seen beauty in those\ngrey eyes, and the straggling, uneven locks had by that time settled\nthemselves into some form of tidiness, and the big joints, having\nbeen covered, had taken upon themselves softer womanly motions,\nand the sister's tenderness to the brother had been appreciated.\nHarry Handcock had spoken a word or two, Margaret being then\nfive-and-twenty, and Harry ten years her senior. Harry had spoken,\nand Margaret had listened only too willingly. But the sick brother\nupstairs had become cross and peevish. Such a thing should never\ntake place with his consent, and Harry Handcock had ceased to speak\ntenderly.\n\nHe had ceased to speak tenderly, though he didn't cease to visit the\nquiet house in Arundel Street. As far as Margaret was concerned he\nmight as well have ceased to come; and in her heart she sang that\nsong of Mariana's, complaining bitterly of her weariness; though the\nman was seen then in her brother's sickroom regularly once a week.\nFor years this went on. The brother would crawl out to his office in\nsummer, but would never leave his bedroom in the winter months. In\nthose days these things were allowed in public offices; and it was\nnot till very near the end of his life that certain stern official\nreformers hinted at the necessity of his retiring on a pension.\nPerhaps it was that hint that killed him. At any rate, he died\nin harness--if it can in truth be said of him that he ever wore\nharness. Then, when he was dead, the days were gone in which Margaret\nMackenzie cared for Harry Handcock. Harry Handcock was still\na bachelor, and when the nature of his late friend's will was\nascertained, he said a word or two to show that he thought he was not\nyet too old for matrimony. But Margaret's weariness could not now be\ncured in that way. She would have taken him while she had nothing, or\nwould have taken him in those early days had fortune filled her lap\nwith gold. But she had seen Harry Handcock at least weekly for the\nlast ten years, and having seen him without any speech of love, she\nwas not now prepared for the renewal of such speaking.\n\nWhen Walter Mackenzie died there was a doubt through all the\nMackenzie circle as to what was the destiny of his money. It was well\nknown that he had been a prudent man, and that he was possessed of a\nfreehold estate which gave him at least six hundred a year. It was\nknown also that he had money saved beyond this. It was known, too,\nthat Margaret had nothing, or next to nothing, of her own. The old\nMackenzie had had no fortune left to him, and had felt it to be a\ngrievance that his sons had not joined their richer lots to his\npoorer lot. This, of course, had been no fault of Margaret's, but it\nhad made him feel justified in leaving his daughter as a burden upon\nhis younger son. For the last fifteen years she had eaten bread to\nwhich she had no positive claim; but if ever woman earned the morsel\nwhich she required, Margaret Mackenzie had earned her morsel during\nher untiring attendance upon her brother. Now she was left to her\nown resources, and as she went silently about the house during those\nsad hours which intervened between the death of her brother and\nhis burial, she was altogether in ignorance whether any means of\nsubsistence had been left to her. It was known that Walter Mackenzie\nhad more than once altered his will--that he had, indeed, made many\nwills--according as he was at such moments on terms of more or less\nfriendship with his brother; but he had never told to any one what\nwas the nature of any bequest that he had made. Thomas Mackenzie had\nthought of both his brother and sister as poor creatures, and had\nbeen thought of by them as being but a poor creature himself. He had\nbecome a shopkeeper, so they declared, and it must be admitted that\nMargaret had shared the feeling which regarded her brother Tom's\ntrade as being disgraceful. They, of Arundel Street, had been idle,\nreckless, useless beings--so Tom had often declared to his wife--and\nonly by fits and starts had there existed any friendship between\nhim and either of them. But the firm of Rubb and Mackenzie was not\ngrowing richer in those days, and both Thomas and his wife had felt\nthemselves forced into a certain amount of conciliatory demeanour by\nthe claims of their seven surviving children. Walter, however, said\nno word to any one of his money; and when he was followed to his\ngrave by his brother and nephews, and by Harry Handcock, no one knew\nof what nature would be the provision made for his sister.\n\n\"He was a great sufferer,\" Harry Handcock had said, at the only\ninterview which took place between him and Margaret after the death\nof her brother and before the reading of the will.\n\n\"Yes indeed, poor fellow,\" said Margaret, sitting in the darkened\ndining-room, in all the gloom of her new mourning.\n\n\"And you yourself, Margaret, have had but a sorry time of it.\" He\nstill called her Margaret from old acquaintance, and had always done\nso.\n\n\"I have had the blessing of good health,\" she said, \"and have been\nvery thankful. It has been a dull life, though, for the last ten\nyears.\"\n\n\"Women generally lead dull lives, I think.\" Then he had paused for\na while, as though something were on his mind which he wished to\nconsider before he spoke again. Mr Handcock, at this time, was bald\nand very stout. He was a strong healthy man, but had about him, to\nthe outward eye, none of the aptitudes of a lover. He was fond of\neating and drinking, as no one knew better than Margaret Mackenzie;\nand had altogether dropped the poetries of life, if at any time any\nof such poetries had belonged to him. He was, in fact, ten years\nolder than Margaret Mackenzie; but he now looked to be almost twenty\nyears her senior. She was a woman who at thirty-five had more of the\ngraces of womanhood than had belonged to her at twenty. He was a man\nwho at forty-five had lost all that youth does for a man. But still I\nthink that she would have fallen back upon her former love, and found\nthat to be sufficient, had he asked her to do so even now. She would\nhave felt herself bound by her faith to do so, had he said that such\nwas his wish, before the reading of her brother's will. But he did no\nsuch thing. \"I hope he will have made you comfortable,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope he will have left me above want,\" Margaret had replied--and\nthat had then been all. She had, perhaps, half-expected something\nmore from him, remembering that the obstacle which had separated them\nwas now removed. But nothing more came, and it would hardly be true\nto say that she was disappointed. She had no strong desire to marry\nHarry Handcock whom no one now called Harry any longer; but yet, for\nthe sake of human nature, she bestowed a sigh upon his coldness, when\nhe carried his tenderness no further than a wish that she might be\ncomfortable.\n\nThere had of necessity been much of secrecy in the life of Margaret\nMackenzie. She had possessed no friend to whom she could express her\nthoughts and feelings with confidence. I doubt whether any living\nbeing knew that there now existed, up in that small back bedroom in\nArundel Street, quires of manuscript in which Margaret had written\nher thoughts and feelings,--hundreds of rhymes which had never met\nany eye but her own; and outspoken words of love contained in letters\nwhich had never been sent, or been intended to be sent, to any\ndestination. Indeed these letters had been commenced with no name,\nand finished with no signature. It would be hardly true to say that\nthey had been intended for Harry Handcock, even at the warmest period\nof her love. They had rather been trials of her strength,--proofs\nof what she might do if fortune should ever be so kind to her as to\nallow of her loving. No one had ever guessed all this, or had dreamed\nof accusing Margaret of romance. No one capable of testing her\ncharacter had known her. In latter days she had now and again dined\nin Gower Street, but her sister-in-law, Mrs Tom, had declared her\nto be a silent, stupid old maid. As a silent, stupid old maid, the\nMackenzies of Rubb and Mackenzie were disposed to regard her. But how\nshould they treat this stupid old maid of an aunt, if it should now\nturn out that all the wealth of the family belonged to her?\n\nWhen Walter's will was read such was found to be the case. There\nwas no doubt, or room for doubt, in the matter. The will was dated\nbut two months before his death, and left everything to Margaret,\nexpressing a conviction on the part of the testator that it was his\nduty to do so, because of his sister's unremitting attention to\nhimself. Harry Handcock was requested to act as executor, and was\nrequested also to accept a gold watch and a present of two hundred\npounds. Not a word was there in the whole will of his brother's\nfamily; and Tom, when he went home with a sad heart, told his wife\nthat all this had come of certain words which she had spoken when\nlast she had visited the sick man. \"I knew it would be so,\" said Tom\nto his wife. \"It can't be helped now, of course. I knew you could not\nkeep your temper quiet, and always told you not to go near him.\" How\nthe wife answered, the course of our story at the present moment does\nnot require me to tell. That she did answer with sufficient spirit,\nno one, I should say, need doubt; and it may be surmised that things\nin Gower Street were not comfortable that evening.\n\nTom Mackenzie had communicated the contents of the will to his\nsister, who had declined to be in the room when it was opened. \"He\nhas left you everything,--just everything,\" Tom had said. If Margaret\nmade any word of reply, Tom did not hear it. \"There will be over\neight hundred a year, and he has left you all the furniture,\" Tom\ncontinued. \"He has been very good,\" said Margaret, hardly knowing how\nto express herself on such an occasion. \"Very good to you,\" said Tom,\nwith some little sarcasm in his voice. \"I mean good to me,\" said\nMargaret. Then he told her that Harry Handcock had been named as\nexecutor. \"There is no more about him in the will, is there?\" said\nMargaret. At the moment, not knowing much about executors, she had\nfancied that her brother had, in making such appointment, expressed\nsome further wish about Mr Handcock. Her brother explained to her\nthat the executor was to have two hundred pounds and a gold watch,\nand then she was satisfied.\n\n\"Of course, it's a very sad look-out for us,\" Tom said; \"but I do not\non that account blame you.\"\n\n\"If you did you would wrong me,\" Margaret answered, \"for I never once\nduring all the years that we lived together spoke to Walter one word\nabout his money.\"\n\n\"I do not blame you,\" the brother rejoined; and then no more had been\nsaid between them.\n\nHe had asked her even before the funeral to go up to Gower Street and\nstay with them, but she had declined. Mrs Tom Mackenzie had not asked\nher. Mrs Tom Mackenzie had hoped, then--had hoped and had inwardly\nresolved--that half, at least, of the dying brother's money would\nhave come to her husband; and she had thought that if she once\nencumbered herself with the old maid, the old maid might remain\nlonger than was desirable. \"We should never get rid of her,\" she had\nsaid to her eldest daughter, Mary Jane. \"Never, mamma,\" Mary Jane had\nreplied. The mother and daughter had thought that they would be on\nthe whole safer in not pressing any such invitation. They had not\npressed it, and the old maid had remained in Arundel Street.\n\nBefore Tom left the house, after the reading of the will, he again\ninvited his sister to his own home. An hour or two had intervened\nsince he had told her of her position in the world, and he was\nastonished at finding how composed and self-assured she was in the\ntone and manner of her answer. \"No, Tom, I think I had better not,\"\nshe said. \"Sarah will be somewhat disappointed.\"\n\n\"You need not mind that,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I think I had better not. I shall be very glad to see her if she\nwill come to me; and I hope you will come, Tom; but I think I will\nremain here till I have made up my mind what to do.\" She remained in\nArundel Street for the next three months, and her brother saw her\nfrequently; but Mrs Tom Mackenzie never went to her, and she never\nwent to Mrs Tom Mackenzie. \"Let it be even so,\" said Mrs Tom; \"they\nshall not say that I ran after her and her money. I hate such airs.\"\n\"So do I, mamma,\" said Mary Jane, tossing her head. \"I always said\nthat she was a nasty old maid.\"\n\nOn that same day,--the day on which the will was read,--Mr Handcock\nhad also come to her. \"I need not tell you,\" he had said, as he\npressed her hand, \"how rejoiced I am--for your sake, Margaret.\"\nThen she had returned the pressure, and had thanked him for his\nfriendship. \"You know that I have been made executor to the will,\" he\ncontinued. \"He did this simply to save you from trouble. I need only\npromise that I will do anything and everything that you can wish.\"\nThen he left her, saying nothing of his suit on that occasion.\n\nTwo months after this,--and during those two months he had\nnecessarily seen her frequently,--Mr Handcock wrote to her from his\noffice in Somerset House, renewing his old proposals of marriage. His\nletter was short and sensible, pleading his cause as well, perhaps,\nas any words were capable of pleading it at this time; but it was not\nsuccessful. As to her money he told her that no doubt he regarded it\nnow as a great addition to their chance of happiness, should they\nput their lots together; and as to his love for her, he referred her\nto the days in which he had desired to make her his wife without a\nshilling of fortune. He had never changed, he said; and if her heart\nwas as constant as his, he would make good now the proposal which she\nhad once been willing to accept. His income was not equal to hers,\nbut it was not inconsiderable, and therefore as regards means they\nwould be very comfortable. Such were his arguments, and Margaret,\nlittle as she knew of the world, was able to perceive that he\nexpected that they would succeed with her.\n\nLittle, however, as she might know of the world, she was not prepared\nto sacrifice herself and her new freedom, and her new power and her\nnew wealth, to Mr Harry Handcock. One word said to her when first\nshe was free and before she was rich, would have carried her. But an\nargumentative, well-worded letter, written to her two months after\nthe fact of her freedom and the fact of her wealth had sunk into\nhis mind, was powerless on her. She had looked at her glass and\nhad perceived that years had improved her, whereas years had not\nimproved Harry Handcock. She had gone back over her old aspirations,\naspirations of which no whisper had ever been uttered, but which had\nnot the less been strong within her, and had told herself that she\ncould not gratify them by a union with Mr Handcock. She thought, or\nrather hoped, that society might still open to her its portals,--not\nsimply the society of the Handcocks from Somerset House, but that\nsociety of which she had read in novels during the day, and of which\nshe had dreamed at night. Might it not yet be given to her to know\nclever people, nice people, bright people, people who were not heavy\nand fat like Mr Handcock, or sick and wearisome like her poor brother\nWalter, or vulgar and quarrelsome like her relatives in Gower Street?\nShe reminded herself that she was the niece of one baronet, and the\nfirst-cousin once removed of another, that she had eight hundred\na year, and liberty to do with it whatsoever she pleased; and she\nreminded herself, also, that she had higher tastes in the world than\nMr Handcock. Therefore she wrote to him an answer, much longer than\nhis letter, in which she explained to him that the more than ten\nyears' interval which had elapsed since words of love had passed\nbetween them had--had--had--changed the nature of her regard. After\nmuch hesitation, that was the phrase which she used.\n\nAnd she was right in her decision. Whether or no she was doomed to be\ndisappointed in her aspirations, or to be partially disappointed and\npartially gratified, these pages are written to tell. But I think\nwe may conclude that she would hardly have made herself happy by\nmarrying Mr Handcock while such aspirations were strong upon her.\nThere was nothing on her side in favour of such a marriage but a\nfaint remembrance of auld lang syne.\n\nShe remained three months in Arundel Street, and before that period\nwas over she made a proposition to her brother Tom, showing to what\nextent she was willing to burden herself on behalf of his family.\nWould he allow her, she asked, to undertake the education and charge\nof his second daughter, Susanna? She would not offer to adopt her\nniece, she said, because it was on the cards that she herself might\nmarry; but she would promise to take upon herself the full expense\nof the girl's education, and all charge of her till such education\nshould be completed. If then any future guardianship on her part\nshould have become incompatible with her own circumstances, she\nshould give Susanna five hundred pounds. There was an air of business\nabout this which quite startled Tom Mackenzie, who, as has before\nbeen said, had taught himself in old days to regard his sister as a\npoor creature. There was specially an air of business about her\nallusion to her own future state. Tom was not at all surprised that\nhis sister should think of marrying, but he was much surprised that\nshe should dare to declare her thoughts. \"Of course she will marry\nthe first fool that asks her,\" said Mrs Tom. The father of the large\nfamily, however, pronounced the offer to be too good to be refused.\n\"If she does, she will keep her word about the five hundred pounds,\"\nhe said. Mrs Tom, though she demurred, of course gave way; and when\nMargaret Mackenzie left London for Littlebath, where lodgings had\nbeen taken for her, she took her niece Susanna with her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nMiss Mackenzie Goes to Littlebath\n\n\nI fear that Miss Mackenzie, when she betook herself to Littlebath,\nhad before her mind's eye no sufficiently settled plan of life. She\nwished to live pleasantly, and perhaps fashionably; but she also\ndesired to live respectably, and with a due regard to religion. How\nshe was to set about doing this at Littlebath, I am afraid she did\nnot quite know. She told herself over and over again that wealth\nentailed duties as well as privileges; but she had no clear idea what\nwere the duties so entailed, or what were the privileges. How could\nshe have obtained any clear idea on the subject in that prison which\nshe had inhabited for so many years by her brother's bedside?\n\nShe had indeed been induced to migrate from London to Littlebath by\nan accident which should not have been allowed to actuate her. She\nhad been ill, and the doctor, with that solicitude which doctors\nsometimes feel for ladies who are well to do in the world, had\nrecommended change of air. Littlebath, among the Tantivy hills, would\nbe the very place for her. There were waters at Littlebath which she\nmight drink for a month or two with great advantage to her system. It\nwas then the end of July, and everybody that was anybody was going\nout of town. Suppose she were to go to Littlebath in August, and stay\nthere for a month, or perhaps two months, as she might feel inclined.\nThe London doctor knew a Littlebath doctor, and would be so happy to\ngive her a letter. Then she spoke to the clergyman of the church she\nhad lately attended in London who also had become more energetic in\nhis assistance since her brother's death than he had been before,\nand he also could give her a letter to a gentleman of his cloth at\nLittlebath. She knew very little in private life of the doctor or of\nthe clergyman in London, but not the less, on that account, might\ntheir introductions be of service to her in forming a circle of\nacquaintance at Littlebath. In this way she first came to think of\nLittlebath, and from this beginning she had gradually reached her\ndecision.\n\nAnother little accident, or two other little accidents, had nearly\ninduced her to remain in London--not in Arundel Street, which was to\nher an odious locality, but in some small genteel house in or about\nBrompton. She had written to the two baronets to announce to them\nher brother's death, Tom Mackenzie, the surviving brother, having\npositively refused to hold any communication with either of them.\nTo both these letters, after some interval, she received courteous\nreplies. Sir Walter Mackenzie was a very old man, over eighty, who\nnow never stirred away from Incharrow, in Ross-shire. Lady Mackenzie\nwas not living. Sir Walter did not write himself, but a letter came\nfrom Mrs Mackenzie, his eldest son's wife, in which she said that\nshe and her husband would be up in London in the course of the next\nspring, and hoped that they might then have the pleasure of making\ntheir cousin's acquaintance. This letter, it was true, did not come\ntill the beginning of August, when the Littlebath plan was nearly\nformed; and Margaret knew that her cousin, who was in Parliament, had\nhimself been in London almost up to the time at which it was written,\nso that he might have called had he chosen. But she was prepared to\nforgive much. There had been cause for offence; and if her great\nrelatives were now prepared to take her by the hand, there could be\nno reason why she should not consent to be so taken. Sir John Ball,\nthe other baronet, had absolutely come to her, and had seen her.\nThere had been a regular scene of reconciliation, and she had gone\ndown for a day and night to the Cedars. Sir John also was an old man,\nbeing over seventy, and Lady Ball was nearly as old. Mr Ball, the\nfuture baronet, had also been there. He was a widower, with a large\nfamily and small means. He had been, and of course still was, a\nbarrister; but as a barrister he had never succeeded, and was now\nwaiting sadly till he should inherit the very moderate fortune which\nwould come to him at his father's death. The Balls, indeed, had not\ndone well with their baronetcy, and their cousin found them living\nwith a degree of strictness, as to small expenses, which she herself\nhad never been called upon to exercise. Lady Ball indeed had a\ncarriage--for what would a baronet's wife do without one?--but it did\nnot very often go out. And the Cedars was an old place, with grounds\nand paddocks appertaining; but the ancient solitary gardener could\nnot make much of the grounds, and the grass of the paddocks was\nalways sold. Margaret, when she was first asked to go to the Cedars,\nfelt that it would be better for her to give up her migration to\nLittlebath. It would be much, she thought, to have her relations near\nto her. But she had found Sir John and Lady Ball to be very dull, and\nher cousin, the father of the large family, had spoken to her about\nlittle except money. She was not much in love with the Balls when she\nreturned to London, and the Littlebath plan was allowed to go on.\n\nShe made a preliminary journey to that place, and took furnished\nlodgings in the Paragon. Now it is known to all the world that the\nParagon is the nucleus of all that is pleasant and fashionable at\nLittlebath. It is a long row of houses with two short rows abutting\nfrom the ends of the long row, and every house in it looks out upon\nthe Montpelier Gardens. If not built of stone, these houses are built\nof such stucco that the Margaret Mackenzies of the world do not know\nthe difference. Six steps, which are of undoubted stone, lead up to\neach door. The areas are grand with high railings. The flagged way\nbefore the houses is very broad, and at each corner there is an\nextensive sweep, so that the carriages of the Paragonites may be\nmade to turn easily. Miss Mackenzie's heart sank a little within her\nat the sight of all this grandeur, when she was first taken to the\nParagon by her new friend the doctor. But she bade her heart be of\ngood courage, and looked at the first floor--divided into dining-room\nand drawing-room--at the large bedroom upstairs for herself, and two\nsmall rooms for her niece and her maid-servant--at the kitchen in\nwhich she was to have a partial property, and did not faint at the\nsplendour. And yet how different it was from those dingy rooms in\nArundel Street! So different that she could hardly bring herself to\nthink that this bright abode could become her own.\n\n\"And what is the price, Mrs Richards?\" Her voice almost did fail her\nas she asked this question. She was determined to be liberal; but\nmoney of her own had hitherto been so scarce with her that she still\ndreaded the idea of expense.\n\n\"The price, mem, is well beknown to all as knows Littlebath. We never\nalters. Ask Dr Pottinger else.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie did not at all wish to ask Dr Pottinger, who was at\nthis moment standing in the front room, while she and her embryo\nlandlady were settling affairs in the back room.\n\n\"But what is the price, Mrs Richards?\"\n\n\"The price, mem, is two pound ten a week, or nine guineas if taken by\nthe month--to include the kitchen fire.\"\n\nMargaret breathed again. She had made her little calculations over\nand over again, and was prepared to bid as high as the sum now named\nfor such a combination of comfort and splendour as Mrs Richards was\nable to offer to her. One little question she asked, putting her lips\nclose to Mrs Richards' ear so that her friend the doctor should not\nhear her through the doorway, and then jumped back a yard and a half,\nawe-struck by the energy of her landlady's reply.\n\n\"B---- in the Paragon!\" Mrs Richards declared that Miss Mackenzie did\nnot as yet know Littlebath. She bethought herself that she did know\nArundel Street, and again thanked Fortune for all the good things\nthat had been given to her.\n\nMiss Mackenzie feared to ask any further questions after this, and\ntook the rooms out of hand by the month.\n\n\"And very comfortable you'll find yourself,\" said Dr Pottinger, as\nhe walked back with his new friend to the inn. He had perhaps been\na little disappointed when he saw that Miss Mackenzie showed every\nsign of good health; but he bore it like a man and a Christian,\nremembering, no doubt, that let a lady's health be ever so good, she\nlikes to see a doctor sometimes, especially if she be alone in the\nworld. He offered her, therefore, every assistance in his power.\n\n\"The assembly rooms were quite close to the Paragon,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Miss Mackenzie, not quite knowing the purport of\nassembly rooms.\n\n\"And there are two or three churches within five minutes' walk.\" Here\nMiss Mackenzie was more at home, and mentioned the name of the Rev.\nMr Stumfold, for whom she had a letter of introduction, and whose\nchurch she would like to attend.\n\nNow Mr Stumfold was a shining light at Littlebath, the man of men, if\nhe was not something more than mere man, in the eyes of the devout\ninhabitants of that town. Miss Mackenzie had never heard of Mr\nStumfold till her clergyman in London had mentioned his name, and\neven now had no idea that he was remarkable for any special views in\nChurch matters. Such special views of her own she had none. But Mr\nStumfold at Littlebath had very special views, and was very specially\nknown for them. His friends said that he was evangelical, and his\nenemies said that he was Low Church. He himself was wont to laugh at\nthese names--for he was a man who could laugh--and to declare that\nhis only ambition was to fight the devil under whatever name he might\nbe allowed to carry on that battle. And he was always fighting the\ndevil by opposing those pursuits which are the life and mainstay of\nsuch places as Littlebath. His chief enemies were card-playing and\ndancing as regarded the weaker sex, and hunting and horse-racing--to\nwhich, indeed, might be added everything under the name of sport--as\nregarded the stronger. Sunday comforts were also enemies which he\nhated with a vigorous hatred, unless three full services a day, with\nsundry intermediate religious readings and exercitations of the\nspirit, may be called Sunday comforts. But not on this account should\nit be supposed that Mr Stumfold was a dreary, dark, sardonic man.\nSuch was by no means the case. He could laugh loud. He could be very\njovial at dinner parties. He could make his little jokes about little\npet wickednesses. A glass of wine, in season, he never refused.\nPicnics he allowed, and the flirtation accompanying them. He himself\nwas driven about behind a pair of horses, and his daughters were\nhorsewomen. His sons, if the world spoke truth, were Nimrods; but\nthat was in another county, away from the Tantivy hills, and Mr\nStumfold knew nothing of it. In Littlebath Mr Stumfold reigned over\nhis own set as a tyrant, but to those who obeyed him he was never\naustere in his tyranny.\n\nWhen Miss Mackenzie mentioned Mr Stumfold's name to the doctor, the\ndoctor felt that he had been wrong in his allusion to the assembly\nrooms. Mr Stumfold's people never went to assembly rooms. He, a\ndoctor of medicine, of course went among saints and sinners alike,\nbut in such a place as Littlebath he had found it expedient to have\none tone for the saints and another for the sinners. Now the Paragon\nwas generally inhabited by sinners, and therefore he had made his\nhint about the assembly rooms. He at once pointed out Mr Stumfold's\nchurch, the spire of which was to be seen as they walked towards the\ninn, and said a word in praise of that good man. Not a syllable would\nhe again have uttered as to the wickednesses of the place, had not\nMiss Mackenzie asked some questions as to those assembly rooms.\n\n\"How did people get to belong to them? Were they pleasant? What did\nthey do there? Oh--she could put her name down, could she? If it was\nanything in the way of amusement she would certainly like to put her\nname down.\" Dr Pottinger, when on that afternoon he instructed his\nwife to call on Miss Mackenzie as soon as that young lady should be\nsettled, explained that the stranger was very much in the dark as to\nthe ways and manners of Littlebath.\n\n\"What! go to the assembly rooms, and sit under Mr Stumfold!\" said Mrs\nPottinger. \"She never can do both, you know.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie went back to London, and returned at the end of a week\nwith her niece, her new maid, and her boxes. All the old furniture\nhad been sold, and her personal belongings were very scanty. The\ntime had now come in which personal belongings would accrue to her,\nbut when she reached the Paragon one big trunk and one small trunk\ncontained all that she possessed. The luggage of her niece Susanna\nwas almost as copious as her own. Her maid had been newly hired, and\nshe was almost ashamed of the scantiness of her own possessions in\nthe eyes of her servant.\n\nThe way in which Susanna had been given up to her had been\noppressive, and at one moment almost distressing. That objection\nwhich each lady had to visit the other,--Miss Mackenzie, that is, and\nSusanna's mamma,--had never been overcome, and neither side had given\nway. No visit of affection or of friendship had been made. But as it\nwas needful that the transfer of the young lady should be effected\nwith some solemnity, Mrs Mackenzie had condescended to bring her to\nher future guardian's lodgings on the day before that fixed for the\njourney to Littlebath. To so much degradation--for in her eyes it was\ndegradation--Mrs Mackenzie had consented to subject herself; and Mr\nMackenzie was to come on the following morning, and take his sister\nand daughter to the train.\n\nThe mother, as soon as she found herself seated and almost before she\nhad recovered the breath lost in mounting the lodging-house stairs,\nbegan the speech which she had prepared for delivery on the occasion.\nMiss Mackenzie, who had taken Susanna's hand, remained with it in her\nown during the greater part of the speech. Before the speech was done\nthe poor girl's hand had been dropped, but in dropping it the aunt\nwas not guilty of any unkindness. \"Margaret,\" said Mrs Mackenzie,\n\"this is a trial, a very great trial to a mother, and I hope that you\nfeel it as I do.\"\n\n\"Sarah,\" said Miss Mackenzie, \"I will do my duty by your child.\"\n\n\"Well; yes; I hope so. If I thought you would not do your duty by\nher, no consideration of mere money would induce me to let her go\nto you. But I do hope, Margaret, you will think of the greatness of\nthe sacrifice we are making. There never was a better child than\nSusanna.\"\n\n\"I am very glad of that, Sarah.\"\n\n\"Indeed, there never was a better child than any of 'em; I will\nsay that for them before the child herself; and if you do your duty\nby her, I'm quite sure she'll do hers by you. Tom thinks it best\nthat she should go; and, of course, as all the money which should\nhave gone to him has come to you\"--it was here, at this point that\nSusanna's hand was dropped--\"and as you haven't got a chick nor a\nchild, nor yet anybody else of your own, no doubt it is natural that\nyou should wish to have one of them.\"\n\n\"I wish to do a kindness to my brother,\" said Miss Mackenzie--\"and to\nmy niece.\"\n\n\"Yes; of course; I understand. When you would not come up to see us,\nMargaret, and you all alone, and we with a comfortable home to offer\nyou, of course I knew what your feelings were towards me. I don't\nwant anybody to tell me that! Oh dear, no! 'Tom,' said I when he\nasked me to go down to Arundel Street, 'not if I know it.' Those were\nthe very words I uttered: 'Not if I know it, Tom!' And your papa\nnever asked me to go again--did he, Susanna? Nor I couldn't have\nbrought myself to. As you are so frank, Margaret, perhaps candour is\nthe best on both sides. Now I am going to leave my darling child in\nyour hands, and if you have got a mother's heart within your bosom, I\nhope you will do a mother's duty by her.\"\n\nMore than once during this oration Miss Mackenzie had felt inclined\nto speak her mind out, and to fight her own battle; but she was\nrepressed by the presence of the girl. What chance could there be of\ngood feeling, of aught of affection between her and her ward, if on\nsuch an occasion as this the girl were made the witness of a quarrel\nbetween her mother and her aunt? Miss Mackenzie's face had become\nred, and she had felt herself to be angry; but she bore it all with\ngood courage.\n\n\"I will do my best,\" said she. \"Susanna, come here and kiss me. Shall\nwe be great friends?\" Susanna went and kissed her; but if the poor\ngirl attempted any answer it was not audible. Then the mother threw\nherself on the daughter's neck, and the two embraced each other with\nmany tears.\n\n\"You'll find all her things very tidy, and plenty of 'em,\" said Mrs\nMackenzie through her tears. \"I'm sure we've worked hard enough at\n'em for the last three weeks.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt we shall find it all very nice,\" said the aunt.\n\n\"We wouldn't send her away to disgrace us, were it ever so; though of\ncourse in the way of money it would make no difference to you if she\nhad come without a thing to her back. But I've that spirit I couldn't\ndo it, and so I told Tom.\" After this Mrs Mackenzie once more\nembraced her daughter, and then took her departure.\n\nMiss Mackenzie, as soon as her sister-in-law was gone, again took the\ngirl's hand in her own. Poor Susanna was in tears, and indeed there\nwas enough in her circumstances at the present moment to justify her\nin weeping. She had been given over to her new destiny in no joyous\nmanner.\n\n\"Susanna,\" said Aunt Margaret, with her softest voice, \"I'm so glad\nyou have come to me. I will love you very dearly if you will let me.\"\n\nThe girl came and clustered close against her as she sat on the sofa,\nand so contrived as to creep in under her arm. No one had ever crept\nin under her arm, or clung close to her before. Such outward signs of\naffection as that had never been hers, either to give or to receive.\n\n\"My darling,\" she said, \"I will love you so dearly.\"\n\nSusanna said nothing, not knowing what words would be fitting for\nsuch an occasion, but on hearing her aunt's assurance of affection,\nshe clung still closer to her, and in this way they became happy\nbefore the evening was over.\n\nThis adopted niece was no child when she was thus placed under\nher aunt's charge. She was already fifteen, and though she was\nyoung-looking for her age,--having none of that precocious air of\nwomanhood which some girls have assumed by that time,--she was a\nstrong healthy well-grown lass, standing stoutly on her legs, with\nher head well balanced, with a straight back, and well-formed though\nnot slender waist. She was sharp about the shoulders and elbows, as\ngirls are--or should be--at that age; and her face was not formed\ninto any definite shape of beauty, or its reverse. But her eyes were\nbright--as were those of all the Mackenzies--and her mouth was not\nthe mouth of a fool. If her cheek-bones were a little high, and the\nlower part of her face somewhat angular, those peculiarities were\nprobably not distasteful to the eyes of her aunt.\n\n\"You're a Mackenzie all over,\" said the aunt, speaking with some\nlittle touch of the northern burr in her voice, though she herself\nhad never known anything of the north.\n\n\"That's what mamma's brothers and sisters always tell me. They say I\nam Scotchy.\"\n\nThen Miss Mackenzie kissed the girl again. If Susanna had been sent\nto her because she had in her gait and appearance more of the land of\ncakes than any of her brothers and sisters, that at any rate should\ndo her no harm in the estimation of her aunt. Thus in this way they\nbecame friends.\n\nOn the following morning Mr Mackenzie came and took them down to the\ntrain.\n\n\"I suppose we shall see you sometimes up in London?\" he said, as he\nstood by the door of the carriage.\n\n\"I don't know that there will be much to bring me up,\" she answered.\n\n\"And there won't be much to keep you down in the country,\" said he.\n\"You don't know anybody at Littlebath, I believe?\"\n\n\"The truth is, Tom, that I don't know anybody anywhere. I'm likely to\nknow as many people at Littlebath as I should in London. But situated\nas I am, I must live pretty much to myself wherever I am.\"\n\nThen the guard came bustling along the platform, the father kissed\nhis daughter for the last time, and kissed his sister also, and our\nheroine with her young charge had taken her departure, and commenced\nher career in the world.\n\nFor many a mile not a word was spoken between Miss Mackenzie and her\nniece. The mind of the elder of the two travellers was very full of\nthought,--of thought and of feeling too, so that she could not bring\nherself to speak joyously to the young girl. She had her doubts as to\nthe wisdom of what she was doing. Her whole life, hitherto, had been\nsad, sombre, and, we may almost say, silent. Things had so gone with\nher that she had had no power of action on her own behalf. Neither\nwith her father, nor with her brother, though both had been invalids,\nhad anything of the management of affairs fallen into her hands. Not\neven in the hiring or discharging of a cookmaid had she possessed\nany influence. No power of the purse had been with her--none of\nthat power which belongs legitimately to a wife because a wife is a\npartner in the business. The two sick men whom she had nursed had\nliked to retain in their own hands the little privileges which their\nposition had given them. Margaret, therefore, had been a nurse in\ntheir houses, and nothing more than a nurse. Had this gone on for\nanother ten years she would have lived down the ambition of any more\nexciting career, and would have been satisfied, had she then come\ninto the possession of the money which was now hers, to have ended\nher days nursing herself--or more probably, as she was by nature\nunselfish, she would have lived down her pride as well as her\nambition, and would have gone to the house of her brother and have\nexpended herself in nursing her nephews and nieces. But luckily for\nher--or unluckily, as it may be--this money had come to her before\nher time for withering had arrived. In heart, and energy, and desire,\nthere was still much of strength left to her. Indeed it may be said\nof her, that she had come so late in life to whatever of ripeness was\nto be vouchsafed to her, that perhaps the period of her thraldom had\nnot terminated itself a day too soon for her advantage. Many of her\nyouthful verses she had destroyed in the packing up of those two\nmodest trunks; but there were effusions of the spirit which had\nflown into rhyme within the last twelve months, and which she still\npreserved. Since her brother's death she had confined herself to\nsimple prose, and for this purpose she kept an ample journal. All\nthis is mentioned to show that at the age of thirty-six Margaret\nMackenzie was still a young woman.\n\nShe had resolved that she would not content herself with a lifeless\nlife, such as those few who knew anything of her evidently expected\nfrom her. Harry Handcock had thought to make her his head nurse; and\nthe Tom Mackenzies had also indulged some such idea when they gave\nher that first invitation to come and live in Gower Street. A word\nor two had been said at the Cedars which led her to suppose that\nthe baronet's family there would have admitted her, with her eight\nhundred a year, had she chosen to be so admitted. But she had\ndeclared to herself that she would make a struggle to do better with\nherself and with her money than that. She would go into the world,\nand see if she could find any of those pleasantnesses of which she\nhad read in books. As for dancing, she was too old, and never yet\nin her life had she stood up as a worshipper of Terpsichore. Of\ncards she knew nothing; she had never even seen them used. To the\nperformance of plays she had been once or twice in her early days,\nand now regarded a theatre not as a sink of wickedness after the\nmanner of the Stumfoldians, but as a place of danger because of\ndifficulty of ingress and egress, because the ways of a theatre were\nfar beyond her ken. The very mode in which it would behove her to\ndress herself to go out to an ordinary dinner party, was almost\nunknown to her. And yet, in spite of all this, she was resolved to\ntry.\n\nWould it not have been easier for her--easier and more\ncomfortable--to have abandoned all ideas of the world, and have put\nherself at once under the tutelage and protection of some clergyman\nwho would have told her how to give away her money, and prepare\nherself in the right way for a comfortable death-bed? There was much\nin this view of life to recommend it. It would be very easy, and\nshe had the necessary faith. Such a clergyman, too, would be a\ncomfortable friend, and, if a married man, might be a very dear\nfriend. And there might, probably, be a clergyman's wife, who would\ngo about with her, and assist in that giving away of her money.\nWould not this be the best life after all? But in order to reconcile\nherself altogether to such a life as that, it was necessary that she\nshould be convinced that the other life was abominable, wicked, and\ndamnable. She had seen enough of things--had looked far enough into\nthe ways of the world--to perceive this. She knew that she must go\nabout such work with strong convictions, and as yet she could not\nbring herself to think that \"dancing and delights\" were damnable.\nNo doubt she would come to have such belief if told so often enough\nby some persuasive divine; but she was not sure that she wished to\nbelieve it.\n\nAfter doubting much, she had determined to give the world a trial,\nand, feeling that London was too big for her, had resolved upon\nLittlebath. But now, having started herself upon her journey, she\nfelt as some mariner might who had put himself out alone to sea in\na small boat, with courage enough for the attempt, but without that\nsort of courage which would make the attempt itself delightful.\n\nAnd then this girl that was with her! She had told herself that it\nwould not be well to live for herself alone, that it was her duty to\nshare her good things with some one, and therefore she had resolved\nto share them with her niece. But in this guardianship there was\ndanger, which frightened her as she thought of it.\n\n\"Are you tired yet, my dear?\" said Miss Mackenzie, as they got to\nSwindon.\n\n\"Oh dear, no; I'm not at all tired.\"\n\n\"There are cakes in there, I see. I wonder whether we should have\ntime to buy one.\"\n\nAfter considering the matter for five minutes in doubt, Aunt Margaret\ndid rush out, and did buy the cakes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nMiss Mackenzie's First Acquaintances\n\n\nIn the first fortnight of Miss Mackenzie's sojourn at Littlebath,\nfour persons called upon her; but though this was a success as far\nas it went, those fourteen days were very dull. During her former\nshort visit to the place she had arranged to send her niece to a\nday school which had been recommended to her as being very genteel,\nand conducted under moral and religious auspices of most exalted\ncharacter. Hither Susanna went every morning after breakfast, and\nreturned home in these summer days at eight o'clock in the evening.\nOn Sundays also, she went to morning church with the other girls; so\nthat Miss Mackenzie was left very much to herself.\n\nMrs Pottinger was the first to call, and the doctor's wife contented\nherself with simple offers of general assistance. She named a baker\nto Miss Mackenzie, and a dressmaker; and she told her what was the\nproper price to be paid by the hour for a private brougham or for a\npublic fly. All this was useful, as Miss Mackenzie was in a state\nof densest ignorance; but it did not seem that much in the way of\namusement would come from the acquaintance of Mrs Pottinger. That\nlady said nothing about the assembly rooms, nor did she speak of the\nStumfoldian manner of life. Her husband had no doubt explained to\nher that the stranger was not as yet a declared disciple in either\nschool. Miss Mackenzie had wished to ask a question about the\nassemblies, but had been deterred by fear. Then came Mr Stumfold in\nperson, and, of course, nothing about the assembly rooms was said\nby him. He made himself very pleasant, and Miss Mackenzie almost\nresolved to put herself into his hands. He did not look sour at her,\nnor did he browbeat her with severe words, nor did he exact from her\nthe performance of any hard duties. He promised to find her a seat in\nhis church, and told her what were the hours of service. He had three\n\"Sabbath services,\" but he thought that regular attendance twice\nevery Sunday was enough for people in general. He would be delighted\nto be of use, and Mrs Stumfold should come and call. Having promised\nthis, he went his way. Then came Mrs Stumfold, according to promise,\nbringing with her one Miss Baker, a maiden lady. From Mrs Stumfold\nour friend got very little assistance. Mrs Stumfold was hard,\nsevere, and perhaps a little grand. She let fall a word or two which\nintimated her conviction that Miss Mackenzie was to become at all\npoints a Stumfoldian, since she had herself invoked the countenance\nand assistance of the great man on her first arrival; but beyond\nthis, Mrs Stumfold afforded no comfort. Our friend could not have\nexplained to herself why it was so, but after having encountered Mrs\nStumfold, she was less inclined to become a disciple than she had\nbeen when she had seen only the great master himself. It was not\nonly that Mrs Stumfold, as judged by externals, was felt to be more\nsevere than her husband evangelically, but she was more severe also\necclesiastically. Miss Mackenzie thought that she could probably obey\nthe ecclesiastical man, but that she would certainly rebel against\nthe ecclesiastical woman.\n\nThere had been, as I have said, a Miss Baker with the female\nminister, and Miss Mackenzie had at once perceived that had Miss\nBaker called alone, the whole thing would have been much more\npleasant. Miss Baker had a soft voice, was given to a good deal of\ngentle talking, was kind in her manner, and prone to quick intimacies\nwith other ladies of her own nature. All this Miss Mackenzie felt\nrather than saw, and would have been delighted to have had Miss Baker\nwithout Mrs Stumfold. She could, she knew, have found out all about\neverything in five minutes, had she and Miss Baker been able to sit\nclose together and to let their tongues loose. But Miss Baker, poor\nsoul, was in these days thoroughly subject to the female Stumfold\ninfluence, and went about the world of Littlebath in a repressed\nmanner that was truly pitiable to those who had known her before the\ndays of her slavery.\n\nBut, as she rose to leave the room at her tyrant's bidding, she spoke\na word of comfort. \"A friend of mine, Miss Mackenzie, lives next door\nto you, and she has begged me to say that she will do herself the\npleasure of calling on you, if you will allow her.\"\n\nThe poor woman hesitated as she made her little speech, and once cast\nher eye round in fear upon her companion.\n\n\"I'm sure I shall be delighted,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"That's Miss Todd, is it?\" said Mrs Stumfold; and it was made\nmanifest by Mrs Stumfold's voice that Mrs Stumfold did not think much\nof Miss Todd.\n\n\"Yes; Miss Todd. You see she is so close a neighbour,\" said Miss\nBaker, apologetically.\n\nMrs Stumfold shook her head, and then went away without further\nspeech.\n\nMiss Mackenzie became at once impatient for Miss Todd's arrival,\nand was induced to keep an eye restlessly at watch on the two\nneighbouring doors in the Paragon, in order that she might see Miss\nTodd at the moment of some entrance or exit. Twice she did see a\nlady come out from the house next her own on the right, a stout\njolly-looking dame, with a red face and a capacious bonnet, who\nclosed the door behind her with a slam, and looked as though she\nwould care little for either male Stumfold or female. Miss Mackenzie,\nhowever, made up her mind that this was not Miss Todd. This lady, she\nthought, was a married lady; on one occasion there had been children\nwith her, and she was, in Miss Mackenzie's judgment, too stout, too\ndecided, and perhaps too loud to be a spinster. A full week passed\nby before this question was decided by the promised visit,--a week\nduring which the new comer never left her house at any hour at which\ncallers could be expected to call, so anxious was she to become\nacquainted with her neighbour; and she had almost given the matter\nup in despair, thinking that Mrs Stumfold had interfered with her\ntyranny, when, one day immediately after lunch--in these days Miss\nMackenzie always lunched, but seldom dined--when one day immediately\nafter lunch, Miss Todd was announced.\n\nMiss Mackenzie immediately saw that she had been wrong. Miss Todd was\nthe stout, red-faced lady with the children. Two of the children,\ngirls of eleven and thirteen, were with her now. As Miss Todd walked\nacross the room to shake hands with her new acquaintance, Miss\nMackenzie at once recognised the manner in which the street door had\nbeen slammed, and knew that it was the same firm step which she had\nheard on the pavement half down the Paragon.\n\n\"My friend, Miss Baker, told me you had come to live next door to\nme,\" began Miss Todd, \"and therefore I told her to tell you that\nI should come and see you. Single ladies, when they come here,\ngenerally like some one to come to them. I'm single myself, and these\nare my nieces. You've got a niece, I believe, too. When the Popes\nhave nephews, people say all manner of ill-natured things. I hope\nthey ain't so uncivil to us.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie smirked and smiled, and assured Miss Todd that she\nwas very glad to see her. The allusion to the Popes she did not\nunderstand.\n\n\"Miss Baker came with Mrs Stumfold, didn't she?\" continued Miss Todd.\n\"She doesn't go much anywhere now without Mrs Stumfold, unless when\nshe creeps down to me. She and I are very old friends. Have you known\nMr Stumfold long? Perhaps you have come here to be near him; a great\nmany ladies do.\"\n\nIn answer to this, Miss Mackenzie explained that she was not a\nfollower of Mr Stumfold in that sense. It was true that she had\nbrought a letter to him, and intended to go to his church. In\nconsequence of that letter, Mrs Stumfold had been good enough to call\nupon her.\n\n\"Oh yes: she'll come to you quick enough. Did she come with her\ncarriage and horses?\"\n\n\"I think she was on foot,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"Then I should tell her of it. Coming to you, in the best house in\nthe Paragon, on your first arrival, she ought to have come with her\ncarriage and horses.\"\n\n\"Tell her of it!\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"A great many ladies would, and would go over to the enemy before the\nmonth was over, unless she brought the carriage in the meantime. I\ndon't advise you to do so. You haven't got standing enough in the\nplace yet, and perhaps she could put you down.\"\n\n\"But it makes no difference to me how she comes.\"\n\n\"None in the least, my dear, or to me either. I should be glad to see\nher even in a wheelbarrow for my part. But you mustn't suppose that\nshe ever comes to me. Lord bless you! no. She found me out to be past\nall grace ever so many years ago.\"\n\n\"Mrs Stumfold thinks that Aunt Sally is the old gentleman himself,\"\nsaid the elder of the girls.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha,\" laughed the aunt. \"You see, Miss Mackenzie, we run very\nmuch into parties here, as they do in most places of this kind, and\nif you mean to go thoroughly in with the Stumfold party you must tell\nme so, candidly, and there won't be any bones broken between us. I\nshan't like you the less for saying so: only in that case it won't be\nany use our trying to see much of each other.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie was somewhat frightened, and hardly knew what answer\nto make. She was very anxious to have it understood that she was not,\nas yet, in bond under Mrs Stumfold--that it was still a matter of\nchoice to herself whether she would be a saint or a sinner; and she\nwould have been so glad to hint to her neighbour that she would like\nto try the sinner's line, if it were only for a month or two; only\nMiss Todd frightened her! And when the girl told her that Miss Todd\nwas regarded, ex parte Stumfold, as being the old gentleman himself,\nMiss Mackenzie again thought for an instant that there would be\nsafety in giving way to the evangelico-ecclesiastical influence, and\nthat perhaps life might be pleasant enough to her if she could be\nallowed to go about in couples with that soft Miss Baker.\n\n\"As you have been so good as to call,\" said Miss Mackenzie, \"I hope\nyou will allow me to return your visit.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes--shall be quite delighted to see you. You can't hurt\nme, you know. The question is, whether I shan't ruin you. Not that I\nand Mr Stumfold ain't great cronies. He and I meet about on neutral\nground, and are the best friends in the world. He knows I'm a lost\nsheep--a gone 'coon, as the Americans say--so he pokes his fun at me,\nand we're as jolly as sandboys. But St Stumfolda is made of sterner\nmetal, and will not put up with any such female levity. If she pokes\nher fun at any sinners, it is at gentlemen sinners; and grim work it\nmust be for them, I should think. Poor Mary Baker! the best creature\nin the world. I'm afraid she has a bad time of it. But then, you\nknow, perhaps that is the sort of thing you like.\"\n\n\"You see I know so very little of Mrs Stumfold,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"That's a misfortune will soon be cured if you let her have her own\nway. You ask Mary Baker else. But I don't mean to be saying anything\nbad behind anybody's back; I don't indeed. I have no doubt these\npeople are very good in their way; only their ways are not my ways;\nand one doesn't like to be told so often that one's own way is broad,\nand that it leads--you know where. Come, Patty, let us be going.\nWhen you've made up your mind, Miss Mackenzie, just you tell me.\nIf you say, 'Miss Todd, I think you're too wicked for me,' I shall\nunderstand it. I shan't be in the least offended. But if my way\nisn't--isn't too broad, you know, I shall be very happy to see you.\"\n\nHereupon Miss Mackenzie plucked up courage and asked a question.\n\n\"Do you ever go to the assembly rooms, Miss Todd?\"\n\nMiss Todd almost whistled before she gave her answer. \"Why, Miss\nMackenzie, that's where they dance and play cards, and where the\ngirls flirt and the young men make fools of themselves. I don't go\nthere very often myself, because I don't care about flirting, and I'm\ntoo old for dancing. As for cards, I get plenty of them at home. I\nthink I did put down my name and paid something when I first came\nhere, but that's ever so many years ago. I don't go to the assembly\nrooms now.\"\n\nAs soon as Miss Todd was gone, Miss Mackenzie went to work to reflect\nseriously upon all she had just heard. Of course, there could be no\nlonger any question of her going to the assembly rooms. Even Miss\nTodd, wicked as she was, did not go there. But should she, or should\nshe not, return Miss Todd's visit? If she did she would be thereby\ncommitting herself to what Miss Todd had profanely called the broad\nway. In such case any advance in the Stumfold direction would be\nforbidden to her. But if she did not call on Miss Todd, then she\nwould have plainly declared that she intended to be such another\ndisciple as Miss Baker, and from that decision there would be no\nrecall. On this subject she must make up her mind, and in doing so\nshe laboured with all her power. As to any charge of incivility which\nmight attach to her for not returning the visit of a lady who had\nbeen so civil to her, of that she thought nothing. Miss Todd had\nherself declared that she would not be in the least offended. But\nshe liked this new acquaintance. In owning all the truth about Miss\nMackenzie, I must confess that her mind hankered after the things of\nthis world. She thought that if she could only establish herself as\nMiss Todd was established, she would care nothing for the Stumfolds,\nmale or female.\n\nBut how was she to do this? An establishment in the Stumfold\ndirection might be easier.\n\nIn the course of the next week two affairs of moment occurred to\nMiss Mackenzie. On the Wednesday morning she received from London a\nletter of business which caused her considerable anxiety, and on the\nThursday afternoon a note was brought to her from Mrs Stumfold,--or\nrather an envelope containing a card on which was printed an\ninvitation to drink tea with that lady on that day week. This\ninvitation she accepted without much doubt. She would go and see\nMrs Stumfold in her house, and would then be better able to decide\nwhether the mode of life practised by the Stumfold party would be\nto her taste. So she wrote a reply, and sent it by her maid-servant,\ngreatly doubting whether she was not wrong in writing her answer on\ncommon note-paper, and whether she also should not have supplied\nherself with some form or card for the occasion.\n\nThe letter of business was from her brother Tom, and contained an\napplication for the loan of some money,--for the loan, indeed, of a\ngood deal of money. But the loan was to be made not to him but to\nthe firm of Rubb and Mackenzie, and was not to be a simple lending\nof money on the faith of that firm, for purposes of speculation or\nordinary business. It was to be expended in the purchase of the\npremises in the New Road, and Miss Mackenzie was to have a mortgage\non them, and was to receive five per cent for the money which she\nshould advance. The letter was long, and though it was manifest\neven to Miss Mackenzie that he had written the first page with much\nhesitation, he had waxed strong as he had gone on, and had really\nmade out a good case. \"You are to understand,\" he said, \"that this\nis, of course, to be done through your own lawyer, who will not allow\nyou to make the loan unless he is satisfied with the security. Our\nlandlords are compelled to sell the premises, and unless we purchase\nthem ourselves, we shall in all probability be turned out, as we have\nonly a year or two more under our present lease. You could purchase\nthe whole thing yourself, but in that case you would not be sure of\nthe same interest for your money.\" He then went on to say that Samuel\nRubb, junior, the son of old Rubb, should run down to Littlebath\nin the course of next week, in order that the whole thing might be\nmade clear to her. Samuel Rubb was not the partner whose name was\nincluded in the designation of the firm, but was a young man,--\"a\ncomparatively young man,\"--as her brother explained, who had lately\nbeen admitted to a share in the business.\n\nThis letter put Miss Mackenzie into a twitter. Like all other single\nladies, she was very nervous about her money. She was quite alive to\nthe beauty of a high rate of interest, but did not quite understand\nthat high interest and impaired security should go hand in hand\ntogether. She wished to oblige her brother, and was aware that she\nhad money as to which her lawyers were looking out for an investment.\nEven this had made her unhappy, as she was not quite sure whether\nher lawyers would not spend the money. She knew that lone women were\nterribly robbed sometimes, and had almost resolved upon insisting\nthat the money should be put into the Three per Cents. But she had\ngone to work with figures, and having ascertained that by doing so\ntwenty-five pounds a year would be docked off from her computed\nincome, she had given no such order. She now again went to work with\nher figures, and found that if the loan were accomplished it would\nadd twenty-five pounds a year to her computed income. Mortgages, she\nknew, were good things, strong and firm, based upon landed security,\nand very respectable. So she wrote to her lawyers, saying that she\nwould be glad to oblige her brother if there were nothing amiss. Her\nlawyers wrote back, advising her to refer Mr Rubb, junior, to them.\nOn the day named in her brother's letter, Mr Samuel Rubb, junior,\narrived at Littlebath, and called upon Miss Mackenzie in the Paragon.\n\nMiss Mackenzie had been brought up with contempt and almost with\nhatred for the Rubb family. It had, in the first instance, been the\nwork of old Samuel Rubb to tempt her brother Tom into trade; and he\nhad tempted Tom into a trade that had not been fat and prosperous,\nand therefore pardonable, but into a trade that had been troublesome\nand poor. Walter Mackenzie had always spoken of these Rubbs\nwith thorough disgust, and had persistently refused to hold any\nintercourse with them. When, therefore, Mr Samuel Rubb was announced,\nour heroine was somewhat inclined to seat herself upon a high horse.\n\nMr Samuel Rubb, junior, came upstairs, and was by no means the sort\nof person in appearance that Miss Mackenzie had expected to see. In\nthe first place, he was, as well as she could guess, about forty\nyears of age; whereas she had expected to see a young man. A man who\nwent about the world especially designated as junior, ought, she\nthought, to be very young. And then Mr Rubb carried with him an\nair of dignity, and had about his external presence a something of\nauthority which made her at once seat herself a peg lower than she\nhad intended. He was a good-looking man, nearly six feet high, with\ngreat hands and feet, but with a great forehead also, which atoned\nfor his hands and feet. He was dressed throughout in black, as\ntradesmen always are in these days; but, as Miss Mackenzie said\nto herself, there was certainly no knowing that he belonged to\nthe oilcloth business from the cut of his coat or the set of his\ntrousers. He began his task with great care, and seemed to have none\nof the hesitation which had afflicted her brother in writing his\nletter. The investment, he said, would, no doubt, be a good one. Two\nthousand four hundred pounds was the sum wanted, and he understood\nthat she had that amount lying idle. Their lawyer had already seen\nher lawyer, and there could be no doubt as to the soundness of the\nmortgage. An assurance company with whom the firm had dealings was\nquite ready to advance the money on the proposed security, and at\nthe proposed rate of interest, but in such a matter as that, Rubb\nand Mackenzie did not wish to deal with an assurance company. They\ndesired that all control over the premises should either be in their\nown hands, or in the hands of someone connected with them.\n\nBy the time that Mr Samuel Rubb had done, Miss Mackenzie found\nherself to have dismounted altogether from her horse, and to be\npervaded by some slight fear that her lawyers might allow so\nfavourable an opportunity for investing her money to slip through\ntheir hands.\n\nThen, on a sudden, Mr Rubb dropped the subject of the loan, and Miss\nMackenzie, as he did so, felt herself to be almost disappointed. And\nwhen she found him talking easily to her about matters of external\nlife, although she answered him readily, and talked to him also\neasily, she entertained some feeling that she ought to be offended.\nMr Rubb, junior, was a tradesman who had come to her on business, and\nhaving done his business, why did he not go away? Nevertheless, Miss\nMackenzie answered him when he asked questions, and allowed herself\nto be seduced into a conversation.\n\n\"Yes, upon my honour,\" he said, looking out of the window into the\nMontpelier Gardens, \"a very nice situation indeed. How much better\nthey do these things in such a place as this than we do up in London!\nWhat dingy houses we live in, and how bright they make the places\nhere!\"\n\n\"They are not crowded so much, I suppose,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"It isn't only that. The truth is, that in London nobody cares what\nhis house looks like. The whole thing is so ugly that anything not\nugly would be out of place. Now, in Paris--you have been in Paris,\nMiss Mackenzie?\"\n\nIn answer to this, Miss Mackenzie was compelled to own that she had\nnever been in Paris.\n\n\"Ah, you should go to Paris, Miss Mackenzie; you should, indeed. Now,\nyou're a lady that have nothing to prevent your going anywhere. If I\nwere you, I'd go almost everywhere; but above all, I'd go to Paris.\nThere's no place like Paris.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\nBy this time Mr Rubb had returned from the window, and had seated\nhimself in the easy chair in the middle of the room. In doing so he\nthrust out both his legs, folded his hands one over the other, and\nlooked very comfortable.\n\n\"Now I'm a slave to business,\" he said. \"That horrid place in the New\nRoad, which we want to buy with your money, has made a prisoner of me\nfor the last twenty years. I went into it as the boy who was to do\nthe copying, when your brother first became a partner. Oh dear, how I\ndid hate it!\"\n\n\"Did you now?\"\n\n\"I should rather think I did. I had been brought up at the Merchant\nTaylors' and they intended to send me to Oxford. That was five years\nbefore they began the business in the New Road. Then came the crash\nwhich our house had at Manchester; and when we had picked up the\npieces, we found that we had to give up university ideas. However,\nI'll make a business of it before I'm done; you see if I don't, Miss\nMackenzie. Your brother has been with us so many years that I have\nquite a pleasure in talking to you about it.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie was not quite sure that she reciprocated the pleasure;\nfor, after all, though he did look so much better than she had\nexpected, he was only Rubb, junior, from Rubb and Mackenzie's; and\nany permanent acquaintance with Mr Rubb would not suit the line of\nlife in which she was desirous of moving. But she did not in the\nleast know how to stop him, or how to show him that she had intended\nto receive him simply as a man of business. And then it was so seldom\nthat anyone came to talk to her, that she was tempted to fall away\nfrom her high resolves. \"I have not known much of my brother's\nconcerns,\" she said, attempting to be cautious.\n\nThen he sat for another hour, making himself very agreeable, and at\nthe end of that time she offered him a glass of wine and a biscuit,\nwhich he accepted. He was going to remain two or three days in the\nneighbourhood, he said, and might he call again before he left?\nMiss Mackenzie told him that he might. How was it possible that\nshe should answer such a question in any other way? Then he got up,\nand shook hands with her, told her that he was so glad he had come\nto Littlebath, and was quite cordial and friendly. Miss Mackenzie\nactually found herself laughing with him as they stood on the floor\ntogether, and though she knew that it was improper, she liked it.\nWhen he was gone she could not remember what it was that had made her\nlaugh, but she remembered that she had laughed. For a long time past\nvery little laughter had come to her share.\n\nWhen he was gone she prepared herself to think about him at length.\nWhy had he talked to her in that way? Why was he going to call again?\nWhy was Rubb, junior, from Rubb and Mackenzie's, such a pleasant\nfellow? After all, he retailed oilcloth at so much a yard; and little\nas she knew of the world, she knew that she, with ever so much good\nblood in her veins, and with ever so many hundreds a year of her own,\nwas entitled to look for acquaintances of a higher order than that.\nShe, if she were entitled to make any boast about herself--and she\nwas by no means inclined to such boastings--might at any rate boast\nthat she was a lady. Now, Mr Rubb was not a gentleman. He was not a\ngentleman by position. She knew that well enough, and she thought\nthat she had also discovered that he was not quite a gentleman in his\nmanners and mode of speech. Nevertheless she had liked him, and had\nlaughed with him, and the remembrance of this made her sad.\n\nThat same evening she wrote a letter to her lawyer, telling him that\nshe was very anxious to oblige her brother, if the security was\ngood. And then she went into the matter at length, repeating much of\nwhat Mr Rubb had said to her, as to the excellence of mortgages in\ngeneral, and of this mortgage in particular. After that she dressed\nherself with great care, and went out to tea at Mrs Stumfold's. This\nwas the first occasion in her life in which she had gone to a party,\nthe invitation to which had come to her on a card, and of course she\nfelt herself to be a little nervous.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nMiss Mackenzie Commences Her Career\n\n\nMiss Mackenzie had been three weeks at Littlebath when the day\narrived on which she was to go to Mrs Stumfold's party, and up to\nthat time she had not enjoyed much of the society of that very social\nplace. Indeed, in these pages have been described with accuracy all\nthe advancement which she had made in that direction. She had indeed\nreturned Miss Todd's call, but had not found that lady at home.\nIn doing this she had almost felt herself to be guilty of treason\nagainst the new allegiance which she seemed to have taken upon\nherself in accepting Mrs Stumfold's invitation; and she had done it\nat last not from any firm resolve of which she might have been proud,\nbut had been driven to it by ennui, and by the easy temptation of\nMiss Todd's neighbouring door. She had, therefore, slipped out, and\nfinding her wicked friend to be not at home, had hurried back again.\nShe had, however, committed herself to a card, and she knew that Mrs\nStumfold would hear of it through Miss Baker. Miss Baker's visit\nshe had not returned, being in doubt where Miss Baker lived, being\nterribly in doubt also whether the Median rules of fashion demanded\nof her that she should return the call of a lady who had simply come\nto her with another caller. Her hesitation on this subject had been\nmuch, and her vacillations many, but she had thought it safer to\nabstain. For the last day or two she had been expecting the return of\nMr Rubb, junior--keeping herself a prisoner, I fear, during the best\nhours of the day, so that she might be there to receive him when he\ndid come; but though she had so acted, she had quite resolved to\nbe very cold with him, and very cautious, and had been desirous\nof seeing him solely with a view to the mercantile necessities of\nher position. It behoved her certainly to attend to business when\nbusiness came in her way, and therefore she would take care to be at\nhome when Mr Rubb should call.\n\nShe had been to church twice a day on each of the Sundays that she\nhad passed in Littlebath, having in this matter strictly obeyed the\nhints which Mr Stumfold had given for her guidance. No doubt she had\nreceived benefit from the discourses which she had heard from that\ngentleman each morning; and, let us hope, benefit also from the much\nlonger discourses which she had heard from Mr Stumfold's curate on\neach evening. The Rev. Mr Maguire was very powerful, but he was also\nvery long; and Miss Mackenzie, who was hardly as yet entitled to rank\nherself among the thoroughly converted, was inclined to think that\nhe was too long. She was, however, patient by nature, and willing to\nbear much, if only some little might come to her in return. What of\nsocial comfort she had expected to obtain from her churchgoings I\ncannot quite define; but I think that she had unconsciously expected\nsomething from them in that direction, and that she had been\ndisappointed.\n\nBut now, at nine o'clock on this appointed evening, she was of\na certainty and in very truth going into society. The card said\nhalf-past eight; but the Sun had not yoked his horses so far away\nfrom her Tyre, remote as that Tyre had been, as to have left her in\nignorance that half-past eight meant nine. When her watch showed her\nthat half-past eight had really come, she was fidgety, and rang the\nbell to inquire whether the man might have probably forgotten to send\nthe fly; and yet she had been very careful to tell the man that she\ndid not wish to be at Mrs Stumfold's before nine.\n\n\"He understands, Miss,\" said the servant; \"don't you be afeard; he's\na-doing of it every night.\"\n\nThen she became painfully conscious that even the maid-servant knew\nmore of the social ways of the place than did she.\n\nWhen she reached the top of Mrs Stumfold's stairs, her heart was in\nher mouth, for she perceived immediately that she had kept people\nwaiting. After all, she had trusted to false intelligence in that\nmatter of the hour. Half-past eight had meant half-past eight,\nand she ought to have known that this would be so in a house so\nupright as that of Mrs Stumfold. That lady met her at the door, and\nsmiling--blandly, but, perhaps I might be permitted to say, not so\nblandly as she might have smiled--conducted the stranger to a seat.\n\n\"We generally open with a little prayer, and for that purpose our\ndear friends are kind enough to come to us punctually.\"\n\nThen Mr Stumfold got up, and pressed her hand very kindly.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Miss Mackenzie had uttered.\n\n\"Not in the least,\" he replied. \"I knew you couldn't know, and\ntherefore we ventured to wait a few minutes. The time hasn't been\nlost, as Mr Maguire has treated us to a theological argument of great\nweight.\"\n\nThen all the company laughed, and Miss Mackenzie perceived that Mr\nStumfold could joke in his way. She was introduced to Mr Maguire, who\nalso pressed her hand; and then Miss Baker came and sat by her side.\nThere was, however, at that moment no time for conversation. The\nprayer was begun immediately, Mr Stumfold taking this duty himself.\nThen Mr Maguire read half a chapter in the Bible, and after that Mr\nStumfold explained it. Two ladies asked Mr Stumfold questions with\ngreat pertinacity, and these questions Mr Stumfold answered very\nfreely, walking about the room the while, and laughing often as he\nsubmitted himself to their interrogations. And Miss Mackenzie was\nmuch astonished at the special freedom of his manner,--how he spoke\nof St Paul as Paul, declaring the saint to have been a good fellow;\nhow he said he liked Luke better than Matthew, and how he named\neven a holier name than these with infinite ease and an accustomed\nfamiliarity which seemed to delight the other ladies; but which at\nfirst shocked her in her ignorance.\n\n\"But I'm not going to have anything more to say to Peter and Paul at\npresent,\" he declared at last. \"You'd keep me here all night, and the\ntea will be spoilt.\"\n\nThen they all laughed again at the absurd idea of this great and good\nman preferring his food,--his food of this world,--to that other food\nwhich it was his special business to dispense. There is nothing which\nthe Stumfoldian ladies of Littlebath liked so much as these little\njokes which bordered on the profanity of the outer world, which made\nthem feel themselves to be almost as funny as the sinners, and gave\nthem a slight taste, as it were, of the pleasures of iniquity.\n\n\"Wine maketh glad the heart of woman, Mrs Jones,\" Mr Stumfold would\nsay as he filled for the second time the glass of some old lady of\nhis set; and the old lady would chirrup and wink, and feel that\nthings were going almost as jollily with her as they did with that\nwicked Mrs Smith, who spent every night of her life playing cards, or\nas they had done with that horrid Mrs Brown, of whom such terrible\nthings were occasionally whispered when two or three ladies found\nthemselves sufficiently private to whisper them; that things were\ngoing almost as pleasant here in this world, although accompanied by\nso much safety as to the future in her own case, and so much danger\nin those other cases! I think it was this aptitude for feminine\nrakishness which, more than any of his great virtues, more even than\nhis indomitable industry, made Mr Stumfold the most popular man in\nLittlebath. A dozen ladies on the present occasion skipped away to\nthe tea-table in the back drawing-room with a delighted alacrity,\nwhich was all owing to the unceremonious treatment which St Peter and\nSt Paul had received from their pastor.\n\nMiss Mackenzie had just found time to cast an eye round the room and\nexamine the scene of Mr Stumfold's pleasantries while Mr Maguire was\nreading. She saw that there were only three gentlemen there besides\nthe two clergymen. There was a very old man who sat close wedged\nin between Mrs Stumfold and another lady, by whose joint dresses\nhe was almost obliterated. This was Mr Peters, a retired attorney.\nHe was Mrs Stumfold's father, and from his coffers had come the\nsuperfluities of comfort which Miss Mackenzie saw around her. Rumour,\neven among the saintly people of Littlebath, said that Mr Peters\nhad been a sharp practitioner in his early days;--that he had been\nsuccessful in his labours was admitted by all.\n\n\"No doubt he has repented,\" Miss Baker said one day to Miss Todd.\n\n\"And if he has not, he has forgotten all about it, which generally\nmeans the same thing,\" Miss Todd had answered.\n\nMr Peters was now very old, and I am disposed to think he had\nforgotten all about it.\n\nThe other two gentlemen were both young, and they stood very high\nin the graces of all the company there assembled. They were high\nin the graces of Mr Stumfold, but higher still in the graces of Mrs\nStumfold, and were almost worshipped by one or two other ladies whose\npowers of external adoration were not diminished by the possession\nof husbands. They were, both of them, young men who had settled\nthemselves for a time at Littlebath that they might be near Mr\nStumfold, and had sufficient of worldly wealth to enable them to pass\ntheir time in semi-clerical pursuits.\n\nMr Frigidy, the elder, intended at some time to go into the Church,\nbut had not as yet made sufficient progress in his studies to justify\nhim in hoping that he could pass a bishop's examination. His friends\ntold him of Islington and St Bees, of Durham, Birkenhead, and other\nplaces where the thing could be done for him; but he hesitated,\nfearing whether he might be able to pass even the initiatory gates\nof Islington. He was a good young man, at peace with all the\nworld--except Mr Startup. With Mr Startup the veracious chronicler\ndoes not dare to assert that Mr Frigidy was at peace. Now Mr Startup\nwas the other young man whom Miss Mackenzie saw in that room.\n\nMr Startup was also a very good young man, but he was of a fiery\ncalibre, whereas Frigidy was naturally mild. Startup was already an\nopen-air preacher, whereas Frigidy lacked nerve to speak a word above\nhis breath. Startup was not a clergyman because certain scruples\nimpeded and prevented him, while in the bosom of Frigidy there\nexisted no desire so strong as that of having the word reverend\nattached to his name. Startup, though he was younger than Frigidy,\ncould talk to seven ladies at once with ease, but Frigidy could not\ntalk to one without much assistance from that lady herself. The\nconsequence of this was that Mr Frigidy could not bring himself to\nlove Mr Startup,--could not enable himself to justify a veracious\nchronicler in saying that he was at peace with all the world, Startup\nincluded.\n\nThe ladies were too many for Miss Mackenzie to notice them specially\nas she sat listening to Mr Maguire's impressive voice. Mr Maguire she\ndid notice, and found him to be the possessor of a good figure, of\na fine head of jet black hair, of a perfect set of white teeth, of\nwhiskers which were also black and very fine, but streaked here and\nthere with a grey hair,--and of the most terrible squint in his right\neye which ever disfigured a face that in all other respects was\nfitted for an Apollo. So egregious was the squint that Miss Mackenzie\ncould not keep herself from regarding it, even while Mr Stumfold\nwas expounding. Had she looked Mr Maguire full in the face at the\nbeginning, I do not think it would so much have mattered to her; but\nshe had seen first the back of his head, and then his profile, and\nhad unfortunately formed a strong opinion as to his almost perfect\nbeauty. When, therefore, the defective eye was disclosed to her, her\nfeelings were moved in a more than ordinary manner. How was it that a\nman graced with such a head, with such a mouth and chin and forehead,\nnay, with such a left eye, could be cursed with such a right eye! She\nwas still thinking of this when the frisky movement into the tea-room\ntook place around her.\n\nWhen at this moment Mr Stumfold offered her his arm to conduct her\nthrough the folding doors, this condescension on his part almost\nconfounded her. The other ladies knew that he always did so to a\nnewcomer, and therefore thought less of it. No other gentleman took\nany other lady, but she was led up to a special seat,--a seat of\nhonour as it were, at the left hand side of a huge silver kettle.\nImmediately before the kettle sat Mrs Stumfold. Immediately before\nanother kettle, at another table, sat Miss Peters, a sister of Mrs\nStumfold's. The back drawing-room in which they were congregated\nwas larger than the other, and opened behind into a pretty garden.\nMr Stumfold's lines in falling thus among the Peters, had fallen\nto him in pleasant places. On the other side of Miss Mackenzie sat\nMiss Baker, and on the other side of Mrs Stumfold stood Mr Startup,\ntalking aloud and administering the full tea-cups with a conscious\ngrace. Mr Stumfold and Mr Frigidy were at the other table, and Mr\nMaguire was occupied in passing promiscuously from one to the other.\nMiss Mackenzie wished with all her heart that he would seat himself\nsomewhere with his face turned away from her, for she found it\nimpossible to avert her eyes from his eye. But he was always\nthere, before her sight, and she began to feel that he was an evil\nspirit,--her evil spirit, and that he would be too many for her.\n\nBefore anybody else was allowed to begin, Mrs Stumfold rose from her\nchair with a large and completely filled bowl of tea, with a plate\nalso laden with buttered toast, and with her own hands and on her own\nlegs carried these delicacies round to her papa. On such an occasion\nas this no servant, no friend, no Mr Startup, was allowed to\ninterfere with her filial piety.\n\n\"She does it always,\" said an admiring lady in an audible whisper\nfrom the other side of Miss Baker. \"She does it always.\"\n\nThe admiring lady was the wife of a retired coachbuilder, who was\npainfully anxious to make her way into good evangelical society at\nLittlebath.\n\n\"Perhaps you will put in the sugar for yourself,\" said Mrs Stumfold\nto Miss Mackenzie as soon as she returned. On this occasion Miss\nMackenzie received her cup the first after the father of the house,\nbut the words spoken to her were stern to the ear.\n\n\"Perhaps you will put in the sugar yourself. It lightens the labour.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie expressed her willingness to do so and regretted that\nMrs Stumfold should have to work so hard. Could she be of assistance?\n\n\"I'm quite used to it, thank you,\" said Mrs Stumfold.\n\nThe words were not uncivil, but the tone was dreadfully severe, and\nMiss Mackenzie felt painfully sure that her hostess was already aware\nof the card that had been left at Miss Todd's door.\n\nMr Startup was now actively at work.\n\n\"Lady Griggs's and Miss Fleebody's--I know. A great deal of\nsugar for her ladyship, and Miss Fleebody eats muffin. Mrs Blow\nalways takes pound-cake, and I'll see that there's one near her.\nMortimer,\"--Mortimer was the footman,--\"is getting more bread and\nbutter. Maguire, you have two dishes of sweet biscuits over there;\ngive us one here. Never mind me, Mrs Stumfold; I'll have my innings\npresently.\"\n\nAll this Mr Frigidy heard with envious ears as he sat with his own\ntea-cup before him at the other table. He would have given the world\nto have been walking about the room like Startup, making himself\nuseful and conspicuous; but he couldn't do it--he knew that he\ncouldn't do it. Later in the evening, when he had been sitting by\nMiss Trotter for two hours--and he had very often sat by Miss Trotter\nbefore--he ventured upon a remark.\n\n\"Don't you think that Mr Startup makes himself a little forward?\"\n\n\"Oh dear yes, very,\" said Miss Trotter. \"I believe he's an excellent\nyoung man, but I always did think him forward, now you mention it.\nAnd sometimes I've wondered how dear Mrs Stumfold could like so much\nof it. But do you know, Mr Frigidy, I am not quite sure that somebody\nelse does like it. You know who I mean.\"\n\nMiss Trotter said much more than this, and Mr Frigidy was comforted,\nand believed that he had been talking.\n\nWhen Mrs Stumfold commenced her conversation with Mr Startup, Miss\nBaker addressed herself to Miss Mackenzie; but there was at first\nsomething of stiffness in her manner,--as became a lady whose call\nhad not been returned.\n\n\"I hope you like Littlebath,\" said Miss Baker.\n\nMiss Mackenzie, who began to be conscious that she had done wrong,\nhesitated as she replied that she liked it pretty well.\n\n\"I think you'll find it pleasant,\" said Miss Baker; and then there\nwas a pause. There could not be two women more fitted for friendship\nthan were these, and it was much to be hoped, for the sake of our\npoor, solitary heroine especially, that this outside crust of manner\nmight be broken up and dispersed.\n\n\"I dare say I shall find it pleasant, after a time,\" said Miss\nMackenzie. Then they applied themselves each to her own bread and\nbutter.\n\n\"You have not seen Miss Todd, I suppose, since I saw you?\" Miss Baker\nasked this question when she perceived that Mrs Stumfold was deep\nin some secret conference with Mr Startup. It must, however, be\ntold to Miss Baker's credit, that she had persistently maintained\nher friendship with Miss Todd, in spite of all the Stumfoldian\ninfluences. Miss Mackenzie, at the moment less brave, looked round\naghast, but seeing that her hostess was in deep conference with her\nprime minister, she took heart of grace. \"I called, and I did not see\nher.\"\n\n\"She promised me she would call,\" said Miss Baker.\n\n\"And I returned her visit, but she wasn't at home,\" said Miss\nMackenzie.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Miss Baker; and then there was silence between them\nagain.\n\nBut, after a pause, Miss Mackenzie again took heart of grace. I\ndo not think that there was, of nature, much of the coward about\nher. Indeed, the very fact that she was there alone at Littlebath,\nfighting her own battle with the world, instead of having allowed\nherself to be swallowed up by the Harry Handcocks, and Tom\nMackenzies, proved her to be anything but a coward. \"Perhaps, Miss\nBaker, I ought to have returned your visit,\" said she.\n\n\"That was just as you like,\" said Miss Baker with her sweetest smile.\n\n\"Of course, I should have liked it, as I thought it so good of you to\ncome. But as you came with Mrs Stumfold, I was not quite sure whether\nit might be intended; and then I didn't know,--did not exactly\nknow,--where you lived.\"\n\nAfter this the two ladies got on very comfortably, so long as they\nwere left sitting side by side. Miss Baker imparted to Miss Mackenzie\nher full address, and Miss Mackenzie, with that brightness in her\neyes which they always assumed when she was eager, begged her new\nfriend to come to her again.\n\n\"Indeed, I will,\" said Miss Baker. After that they were parted by a\ngeneral return to the front room.\n\nAnd now Miss Mackenzie found herself seated next to Mr Maguire. She\nhad been carried away in the crowd to a further corner, in which\nthere were two chairs, and before she had been able to consider the\nmerits or demerits of the position, Mr Maguire was seated close\nbeside her. He was seated close beside her in such a way as to make\nthe two specially separated from all the world beyond, for in front\nof them stood a wall of crinoline,--a wall of crinoline divided\nbetween four or five owners, among whom was shared the eloquence of\nMr Startup, who was carrying on an evangelical flirtation with the\nwhole of them in a manner that was greatly pleasing to them, and\nenthusiastically delightful to him. Miss Mackenzie, when she found\nherself thus entrapped, looked into Mr Maguire's eye with dismay.\nHad that look been sure to bring down upon her the hatred of that\nreverend gentleman, she could not have helped it. The eye fascinated\nher, as much as it frightened her. But Mr Maguire was used to have\nhis eye inspected, and did not hate her. He fixed it apparently on\nthe corners of the wall, but in truth upon her, and then he began:\n\n\"I am so glad that you have come among us, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"I'm sure that I'm very much obliged.\"\n\n\"Well; you ought to be. You must not be surprised at my saying\nso, though it sounds uncivil. You ought to feel obliged, and the\nobligation should be mutual. I am not sure, that when all things are\nconsidered, you could find yourself in any better place in England,\nthan in the drawing-room of my friend Stumfold; and, if you will\nallow me to say so, my friend Stumfold could hardly use his\ndrawing-room better, than by entertaining you.\"\n\n\"Mr Stumfold is very good, and so is she.\"\n\n\"Mr Stumfold is very good; and as for Mrs Stumfold, I look upon her\nas a very wonderful woman,--quite a wonderful woman. For grasp of\nintellect, for depth of thought, for tenderness of sentiment--perhaps\nyou mightn't have expected that, but there it is--for tenderness of\nsentiment, for strength of faith, for purity of life, for genial\nhospitality, and all the domestic duties, Mrs Stumfold has no equal\nin Littlebath, and perhaps few superiors elsewhere.\"\n\nHere Mr Maguire paused, and Miss Mackenzie, finding herself obliged\nto speak, said that she did not at all doubt it.\n\n\"You need not doubt it, Miss Mackenzie. She is all that, I tell you;\nand more, too. Her manners may seem a little harsh to you at first. I\nknow it is so sometimes with ladies before they know her well; but it\nis only skin-deep, Miss Mackenzie,--only skin-deep. She is so much in\nearnest about her work, that she cannot bring herself to be light and\nplayful as he is. Now, he is as full of play as a young lamb.\"\n\n\"He seems to be very pleasant.\"\n\n\"And he is always just the same. There are people, you know, who say\nthat religion is austere and melancholy. They never could say that\nif they knew my friend Stumfold. His life is devoted to his clerical\nduties. I know no man who works harder in the vineyard than Stumfold.\nBut he always works with a smile on his face. And why not, Miss\nMackenzie? when you think of it, why not?\"\n\n\"I dare say it's best not to be unhappy,\" said Miss Mackenzie. She\ndid not speak till she perceived that he had paused for her answer.\n\n\"Of course we know that this world can make no one happy. What are we\nthat we should dare to be happy here?\"\n\nAgain he paused, but Miss Mackenzie feeling that she had been\nill-treated and trapped into a difficulty at her last reply,\nresolutely remained silent.\n\n\"I defy any man or woman to be happy here,\" said Mr Maguire, looking\nat her with one eye and at the corner of the wall with the other in\na manner that was very terrible to her. \"But we may be cheerful,--we\nmay go about our work singing psalms of praise instead of songs of\nsorrow. Don't you agree with me, Miss Mackenzie, that psalms of\npraise are better than songs of sorrow?\"\n\n\"I don't sing at all, myself,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"You sing in your heart, my friend; I am sure you sing in your heart.\nDon't you sing in your heart?\" Here again he paused.\n\n\"Well; perhaps in my heart, yes.\"\n\n\"I know you do, loud psalms of praise upon a ten-stringed lute. But\nStumfold is always singing aloud, and his lute has twenty strings.\"\nHere the voice of the twenty-stringed singer was heard across the\nlarge room asking the company a riddle.\n\n\"Why was Peter in prison like a little boy with his shoes off?\"\n\n\"That's so like him,\" said Mr Maguire.\n\nAll the ladies in the room were in a fever of expectation, and Mr\nStumfold asked the riddle again.\n\n\"He won't tell them till we meet again; but there isn't one here\nwho won't study the life of St Peter during the next week. And what\nthey'll learn in that way they'll never forget.\"\n\n\"But why was he like a little boy with his shoes off?\" asked Miss\nMackenzie.\n\n\"Ah! that's Stumfold's riddle. You must ask Mr Stumfold, and he won't\ntell you till next week. But some of the ladies will be sure to find\nit out before then. Have you come to settle yourself altogether at\nLittlebath, Miss Mackenzie?\"\n\nThis question he asked very abruptly, but he had a way of looking at\nher when he asked a question, which made it impossible for her to\navoid an answer.\n\n\"I suppose I shall stay here for some considerable time.\"\n\n\"Do, do,\" said he with energy. \"Do; come and live among us, and be\none of us; come and partake with us at the feast which we are making\nready; come and eat of our crusts, and dip with us in the same dish;\ncome and be of our flock, and go with us into the pleasant pastures,\namong the lanes and green hedges which appertain to the farm of\nthe Lord. Come and walk with us through the Sabbath cornfields,\nand pluck the ears when you are a-hungered, disregarding the broad\nphylacteries. Come and sing with us songs of a joyful heart, and let\nus be glad together. What better can you do, Miss Mackenzie? I don't\nbelieve there is a more healthy place in the world than Littlebath,\nand, considering that the place is fashionable, things are really\nvery reasonable.\"\n\nHe was rapid in his utterance, and so full of energy, that Miss\nMackenzie did not quite follow him in his quick transitions. She\nhardly understood whether he was advising her to take up an abode in\na terrestrial Eden or a celestial Paradise; but she presumed that he\nmeant to be civil, so she thanked him and said she thought she would.\nIt was a thousand pities that he should squint so frightfully, as in\nall other respects he was a good-looking man. Just at this moment\nthere seemed to be a sudden breaking up of the party.\n\n\"We are all going away,\" said Mr Maguire. \"We always do when Mrs\nStumfold gets up from her seat. She does it when she sees that her\nfather is nodding his head. You must let me out, because I've got to\nsay a prayer. By-the-bye, you'll allow me to walk home with you, I\nhope. I shall be so happy to be useful.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie told him that the fly was coming for her, and then he\nscrambled away into the middle of the room.\n\n\"We always walk home from these parties,\" said Miss Baker, who\nhad, however, on this occasion, consented to be taken away by Miss\nMackenzie in the fly. \"It makes it come so much cheaper, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course it does; and it's quite as nice if everybody does it. But\nyou don't walk going there?\"\n\n\"Not generally,\" said Miss Baker; \"but there are some of them who\ndo that. Miss Trotter always walks both ways, if it's ever so wet.\"\nThen there were a few words said about Miss Trotter which were not\naltogether good-natured.\n\nMiss Mackenzie, as soon as she was at home, got down her Bible and\npuzzled herself for an hour over that riddle of Mr Stumfold's; but\nwith all her trouble she could not find why St Peter in prison was\nlike a little boy with his shoes off.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nShowing How Mr Rubb, Junior, Progressed at Littlebath\n\n\nA full week had passed by after Mrs Stumfold's tea-party before Mr\nRubb called again at the Paragon; and in the meantime Miss Mackenzie\nhad been informed by her lawyer that there did not appear to be any\nobjection to the mortgage, if she liked the investment for her money.\n\n\"You couldn't do better with your money,--you couldn't indeed,\" said\nMr Rubb, when Miss Mackenzie, meaning to be cautious, started the\nconversation at once upon matters of business.\n\nMr Rubb had not been in any great hurry to repeat his call, and Miss\nMackenzie had resolved that if he did come again she would treat him\nsimply as a member of the firm with whom she had to transact certain\nmonetary arrangements. Beyond that she would not go; and as she so\nresolved, she repented herself of the sherry and biscuit.\n\nThe people whom she had met at Mr Stumfold's had been all ladies and\ngentlemen; she, at least, had supposed them to be so, not having\nas yet received any special information respecting the wife of the\nretired coachbuilder. Mr Rubb was not a gentleman; and though she was\nby no means inclined to give herself airs,--though, as she assured\nherself, she believed Mr Rubb to be quite as good as herself,--yet\nthere was, and must always be, a difference among people. She had no\ninclination to be proud; but if Providence had been pleased to place\nher in one position, it did not behove her to degrade herself by\nassuming a position that was lower. Therefore, on this account, and\nby no means moved by any personal contempt towards Mr Rubb, or the\nRubbs of the world in general, she was resolved that she would not\nask him to take any more sherry and biscuits.\n\nPoor Miss Mackenzie! I fear that they who read this chronicle of her\nlife will already have allowed themselves to think worse of her than\nshe deserved. Many of them, I know, will think far worse of her than\nthey should think. Of what faults, even if we analyse her faults, has\nshe been guilty? Where she has been weak, who among us is not, in\nthat, weak also? Of what vanity has she been guilty with which the\nleast vain among us might not justly tax himself? Having been left\nalone in the world, she has looked to make friends for herself; and\nin seeking for new friends she has wished to find the best that might\ncome in her way.\n\nMr Rubb was very good-looking; Mr Maguire was afflicted by a terrible\nsquint. Mr Rubb's mode of speaking was pleasant to her; whereas she\nwas by no means sure that she liked Mr Maguire's speech. But Mr\nMaguire was by profession a gentleman. As the discreet young man,\nwho is desirous of rising in the world, will eschew skittles, and in\npreference go out to tea at his aunt's house--much more delectable as\nskittles are to his own heart--so did Miss Mackenzie resolve that it\nwould become her to select Messrs Stumfold and Maguire as her male\nfriends, and to treat Mr Rubb simply as a man of business. She was\ndenying herself skittles and beer, and putting up with tea and an old\naunt, because she preferred the proprieties of life to its pleasures.\nIs it right that she should be blamed for such self-denial? But now\nthe skittles and beer had come after her, as those delights will\nsometimes pursue the prudent youth who would fain avoid them. Mr\nRubb was there, in her drawing-room, looking extremely well, shaking\nhands with her very comfortably, and soon abandoning his conversation\non that matter of business to which she had determined to confine\nherself. She was angry with him, thinking him to be very free and\neasy; but, nevertheless, she could not keep herself from talking to\nhim.\n\n\"You can't do better than five per cent,\" he had said to her, \"not\nwith first-class security, such as this is.\"\n\nAll that had been well enough. Five per cent and first-class security\nwere, she knew, matters of business; and though Mr Rubb had winked\nhis eye at her as he spoke of them, leaning forward in his chair\nand looking at her not at all as a man of business, but quite in a\nfriendly way, yet she had felt that she was so far safe. She nodded\nher head also, merely intending him to understand thereby that she\nherself understood something about business. But when he suddenly\nchanged the subject, and asked her how she liked Mr Stumfold's set,\nshe drew herself up suddenly and placed herself at once upon her\nguard.\n\n\"I have heard a great deal about Mr Stumfold,\" continued Mr Rubb, not\nappearing to observe the lady's altered manner, \"not only here and\nwhere I have been for the last few days, but up in London also. He is\nquite a public character, you know.\"\n\n\"Clergymen in towns, who have large congregations, always must so be,\nI suppose.\"\n\n\"Well, yes; more or less. But Mr Stumfold is decidedly more, and not\nless. People say he is going in for a bishopric.\"\n\n\"I had not heard it,\" said Miss Mackenzie, who did not quite\nunderstand what was meant by going in for a bishopric.\n\n\"Oh, yes, and a very likely man he would have been a year or two ago.\nBut they say the prime minister has changed his tap lately.\"\n\n\"Changed his tap!\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"He used to draw his bishops very bitter, but now he draws them mild\nand creamy. I dare say Stumfold did his best, but he didn't quite get\nhis hay in while the sun shone.\"\n\n\"He seems to me to be very comfortable where he is,\" said Miss\nMackenzie.\n\n\"I dare say. It must be rather a bore for him having to live in the\nhouse with old Peters. How Peters scraped his money together, nobody\never knew yet; and you are aware, Miss Mackenzie, that old as he is,\nhe keeps it all in his own hands. That house, and everything that is\nin it, belongs to him; you know that, I dare say.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie, who could not keep herself from being a little\ninterested in these matters, said that she had not known it.\n\n\"Oh dear, yes! and the carriage too. I've no doubt Stumfold will be\nall right when the old fellow dies. Such men as Stumfold don't often\nmake mistakes about their money. But as long as old Peters lasts I\nshouldn't think it can be quite serene. They say that she is always\ncutting up rough with the old man.\"\n\n\"She seemed to me to behave very well to him,\" said Miss Mackenzie,\nremembering the carriage of the tea-cup.\n\n\"I dare say it is so before company, and of course that's all right;\nit's much better that the dirty linen should be washed in private.\nStumfold is a clever man, there's no doubt about that. If you've been\nmuch to his house, you've probably met his curate, Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"I've only been there once, but I did meet Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"A man that squints fearfully. They say he's looking out for a wife\ntoo, only she must not have a father living, as Mrs Stumfold has.\nIt's astonishing how these parsons pick up all the good things that\nare going in the way of money.\" Miss Mackenzie, as she heard this,\ncould not but remember that she might be regarded as a good thing\ngoing in the way of money, and became painfully aware that her face\nbetrayed her consciousness.\n\n\"You'll have to keep a sharp look out,\" continued Mr Rubb, giving her\na kind caution, as though he were an old familiar friend.\n\n\"I don't think there's any fear of that kind,\" said Miss Mackenzie,\nblushing.\n\n\"I don't know about fear, but I should say that there is great\nprobability; of course I am only joking about Mr Maguire. Like the\nrest of them, of course, he wishes to feather his own nest; and why\nshouldn't he? But you may be sure of this, Miss Mackenzie, a lady\nwith your fortune, and, if I may be allowed to say so, with your\npersonal attractions, will not want for admirers.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie was very strongly of opinion that Mr Rubb might not\nbe allowed to say so. She thought that he was behaving with an\nunwarrantable degree of freedom in saying anything of the kind;\nbut she did not know how to tell him either by words or looks that\nsuch was the case. And, perhaps, though the impertinence was almost\nunendurable, the idea conveyed was not altogether so grievous; it\nhad certainly never hitherto occurred to her that she might become\na second Mrs Stumfold; but, after all, why not? What she wanted\nwas simply this, that something of interest should be added to her\nlife. Why should not she also work in the vineyard, in the open\nquasiclerical vineyard of the Lord's people, and also in the private\nvineyard of some one of the people's pastors? Mr Rubb was very\nimpertinent, but it might, perhaps, be worth her while to think of\nwhat he said. As regarded Mr Maguire, the gentleman whose name had\nbeen specially mentioned, it was quite true that he did squint\nawfully.\n\n\"Mr Rubb,\" said she, \"if you please, I'd rather not talk about such\nthings as that.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, what I say is true, Miss Mackenzie; I hope you don't\ntake it amiss that I venture to feel an interest about you.\"\n\n\"Oh! no,\" said she; \"not that I suppose you do feel any special\ninterest about me.\"\n\n\"But indeed I do, and isn't it natural? If you will remember that\nyour only brother is the oldest friend that I have in the world, how\ncan it be otherwise? Of course he is much older than me, and very\nmuch older than you, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"Just twelve years,\" said she, very stiffly.\n\n\"I thought it had been more, but in that case you and I are nearly of\nan age. As that is so, how can I fail to feel an interest about you?\nI have neither mother, nor sister, nor wife of my own; a sister,\nindeed, I have, but she's married at Singapore, and I have not seen\nher for seventeen years.\"\n\n\"Indeed.\"\n\n\"No, not for seventeen years; and the heart does crave for some\nfemale friend, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"You ought to get a wife, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"That's what your brother always says. 'Samuel,' he said to me just\nbefore I left town, 'you're settled with us now; your father has as\ngood as given up to you his share of the business, and you ought to\nget married.' Now, Miss Mackenzie, I wouldn't take that sort of thing\nfrom any man but your brother; it's very odd that you should say\nexactly the same thing too.\"\n\n\"I hope I have not offended you.\"\n\n\"Offended me! no, indeed, I'm not such a fool as that. I'd sooner\nknow that you took an interest in me than any woman living. I would,\nindeed. I dare say you don't think much of it, but when I remember\nthat the names of Rubb and Mackenzie have been joined together for\nmore than twenty years, it seems natural to me that you and I should\nbe friends.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie, in the few moments which were allowed to her for\nreflection before she was obliged to answer, again admitted to\nherself that he spoke the truth. If there was any fault in the matter\nthe fault was with her brother Tom, who had joined the name of\nMackenzie with the name of Rubb in the first instance. Where was this\nyoung man to look for a female friend if not to his partner's family,\nseeing that he had neither wife nor mother of his own, nor indeed a\nsister, except one out at Singapore, who was hardly available for any\nof the purposes of family affection? And yet it was hard upon her. It\nwas through no negligence on her part that poor Mr Rubb was so ill\nprovided. \"Perhaps it might have been so if I had continued to live\nin London,\" said Miss Mackenzie; \"but as I live at Littlebath--\" Then\nshe paused, not knowing how to finish her sentence.\n\n\"What difference does that make? The distance is nothing if you come\nto think of it. Your hall door is just two hours and a quarter from\nour place of business in the New Road; and it's one pound five and\nnine if you go by first-class and cabs, or sixteen and ten if you put\nup with second-class and omnibuses. There's no other way of counting.\nMiles mean nothing now-a-days.\"\n\n\"They don't mean much, certainly.\"\n\n\"They mean nothing. Why, Miss Mackenzie, I should think it no trouble\nat all to run down and consult you about anything that occurred,\nabout any matter of business that weighed at all heavily, if nothing\nprevented me except distance. Thirty shillings more than does it all,\nwith a return ticket, including a bit of lunch at the station.\"\n\n\"Oh! and as for that--\"\n\n\"I know what you mean, Miss Mackenzie, and I shall never forget how\nkind you were to offer me refreshment when I was here before.\"\n\n\"But, Mr Rubb, I hope you won't think of doing such a thing. What\ngood could I do you? I know nothing about business; and really, to\ntell the truth, I should be most unwilling to interfere--that is, you\nknow, to say anything about anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"I only meant to point out that the distance is nothing. And as to\nwhat you were advising me about getting married--\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to advise you, Mr Rubb!\"\n\n\"I thought you said so.\"\n\n\"But, of course, I did not intend to discuss such a matter\nseriously.\"\n\n\"It's a most serious subject to me, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"No doubt; but it's one I can't know anything about. Men in business\ngenerally do find, I think, that they get on better when they are\nmarried.\"\n\n\"Yes, they do.\"\n\n\"That's all I meant to say, Mr Rubb.\"\n\nAfter this he sat silent for a few minutes, and I am inclined to\nthink that he was weighing in his mind the expediency of asking\nher to become Mrs Rubb, on the spur of the moment. But if so, his\nmind finally gave judgment against the attempt, and in giving such\njudgment his mind was right. He would certainly have so startled\nher by the precipitancy of such a proposition, as to have greatly\nendangered the probability of any further intimacy with her. As it\nwas, he changed the conversation, and began to ask questions as to\nthe welfare of his partner's daughter. At this period of the day\nSusanna was at school, and he was informed that she would not be home\ntill the evening. Then he plucked up courage and begged to be allowed\nto come again,--just to look in at eight o'clock, so that he might\nsee Susanna. He could not go back to London comfortably, unless he\ncould give some tidings of Susanna to the family in Gower Street.\nWhat was she to do? Of course she was obliged to ask him to drink tea\nwith them. \"That would be so pleasant,\" he said; and Miss Mackenzie\nowned to herself that the gratification expressed in his face as he\nspoke was very becoming.\n\nWhen Susanna came home she did not seem to know much of Mr Rubb,\njunior, or to care much about him. Old Mr Rubb lived, she knew, near\nthe place of business in the New Road, and sometimes he came to Gower\nStreet, but nobody liked him. She didn't remember that she had ever\nseen Mr Rubb, junior, at her mother's house but once, when he came to\ndinner. When she was told that Mr Rubb was very anxious to see her,\nshe chucked up her head and said that the man was a goose.\n\nHe came, and in a very few minutes he had talked over Susanna. He\nbrought her a little present,--a work-box,--which he had bought for\nher at Littlebath; and though the work-box itself did not altogether\navail, it paved the way for civil words, which were more efficacious.\nOn this occasion he talked more to his partner's daughter than to\nhis partner's sister, and promised to tell her mamma how well she\nwas looking, and that the air of Littlebath had brought roses to her\ncheeks.\n\n\"I think it is a healthy place,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"I'm quite sure it is,\" said Mr Rubb. \"And you like Mrs Crammer's\nschool, Susanna?\"\n\nShe would have preferred to have been called Miss Mackenzie, but was\nnot disposed to quarrel with him on the point.\n\n\"Yes, I like it very well,\" she said. \"The other girls are very nice;\nand if one must go to school, I suppose it's as good as any other\nschool.\"\n\n\"Susanna thinks that going to school at all is rather a nuisance,\"\nsaid Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"You'd think so too, aunt, if you had to practise every day for an\nhour in the same room with four other pianos. It's my belief that I\nshall hate the sound of a piano the longest day that I shall live.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's the same with all young ladies,\" said Mr Rubb.\n\n\"It's the same with them all at Mrs Crammer's. There isn't one there\nthat does not hate it.\"\n\n\"But you wouldn't like not to be able to play,\" said her aunt.\n\n\"Mamma doesn't play, and you don't play; and I don't see what's the\nuse of it. It won't make anybody like music to hear four pianos all\ngoing at the same time, and all of them out of tune.\"\n\n\"You must not tell them in Gower Street, Mr Rubb, that Susanna talks\nlike that,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"Yes, you may, Mr Rubb. But you must tell them at the same time that\nI am quite happy, and that Aunt Margaret is the dearest woman in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"I'll be sure to tell them that,\" said Mr Rubb. Then he went away,\npressing Miss Mackenzie's hand warmly as he took his leave; and as\nsoon as he was gone, his character was of course discussed.\n\n\"He's quite a different man, aunt, from what I thought; and he's not\nat all like old Mr Rubb. Old Mr Rubb, when he comes to drink tea\nin Gower Street, puts his handkerchief over his knees to catch the\ncrumbs.\"\n\n\"There's no great harm in that, Susanna.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose there's any harm in it. It's not wicked. It's not\nwicked to eat gravy with your knife.\"\n\n\"And does old Mr Rubb do that?\"\n\n\"Always. We used to laugh at him, because he is so clever at it. He\nnever spills any; and his knife seems to be quite as good as a spoon.\nBut this Mr Rubb doesn't do things of that sort.\"\n\n\"He's younger, my dear.\"\n\n\"But being younger doesn't make people more ladylike of itself.\"\n\n\"I did not know that Mr Rubb was exactly ladylike.\"\n\n\"That's taking me up unfairly; isn't it, aunt? You know what I meant;\nand only fancy that the man should go out and buy me a work-box.\nThat's more than old Mr Rubb ever did for any of us, since the first\nday he knew us. And, then, didn't you think that young Mr Rubb is a\nhandsome man, aunt?\"\n\n\"He's all very well, my dear.\"\n\n\"Oh; I think he is downright handsome; I do, indeed. Miss\nDumpus,--that's Mrs Crammer's sister,--told us the other day, that\nI was wrong to talk about a man being handsome; but that must be\nnonsense, aunt?\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all, my dear. If she told you so, you ought to\nbelieve that it is not nonsense.\"\n\n\"Come, aunt; you don't mean to tell me that you would believe all\nthat Miss Dumpus says. Miss Dumpus says that girls should never laugh\nabove their breath when they are more than fourteen years old. How\ncan you make a change in your laughing just when you come to be\nfourteen? And why shouldn't you say a man's handsome, if he is\nhandsome?\"\n\n\"You'd better go to bed, Susanna.\"\n\n\"That won't make Mr Rubb ugly. I wish you had asked him to come and\ndine here on Sunday, so that we might have seen whether he eats his\ngravy with his knife. I looked very hard to see whether he'd catch\nhis crumbs in his handkerchief.\"\n\nThen Susanna went to her bed, and Miss Mackenzie was left alone to\nthink over the perfections and imperfections of Mr Samuel Rubb,\njunior.\n\nFrom that time up to Christmas she saw no more of Mr Rubb; but she\nheard from him twice. His letters, however, had reference solely\nto business, and were not of a nature to produce either anger or\nadmiration. She had also heard more than once from her lawyer; and a\nquestion had arisen as to which she was called upon to trust to her\nown judgment for a decision. Messrs Rubb and Mackenzie had wanted the\nmoney at once, whereas the papers for the mortgage were not ready.\nWould Miss Mackenzie allow Messrs Rubb and Mackenzie to have the\nmoney under these circumstances? To this inquiry from her lawyer\nshe made a rejoinder asking for advice. Her lawyer told her that he\ncould not recommend her, in the ordinary way of business, to make any\nadvance of money without positive security; but, as this was a matter\nbetween friends and near relatives, she might perhaps be willing to\ndo it; and he added that, as far as his own opinion went, he did not\nthink that there would be any great risk. But then it all depended\non this:--did she want to oblige her friends and near relatives? In\nanswer to this question she told herself that she certainly did wish\nto do so; and she declared,--also to herself,--that she was willing\nto advance the money to her brother, even though there might be some\nrisk. The upshot of all this was that Messrs Rubb and Mackenzie\ngot the money some time in October, but that the mortgage was not\ncompleted when Christmas came. It was on this matter that Mr Rubb,\njunior, had written to Miss Mackenzie, and his letter had been of a\nnature to give her a feeling of perfect security in the transaction.\nWith her brother she had had no further correspondence; but this did\nnot surprise her, as her brother was a man much less facile in his\nmodes of expression than his younger partner.\n\nAs the autumn had progressed at Littlebath, she had become more and\nmore intimate with Miss Baker, till she had almost taught herself\nto regard that lady as a dear friend. She had fallen into the habit\nof going to Mrs Stumfold's tea-parties every fortnight, and was\nnow regarded as a regular Stumfoldian by all those who interested\nthemselves in such matters. She had begun a system of district\nvisiting and Bible reading with Miss Baker, which had at first been\nvery agreeable to her. But Mrs Stumfold had on one occasion called\nupon her and taken her to task,--as Miss Mackenzie had thought,\nrather abruptly,--with reference to some lack of energy or indiscreet\nomission of which she had been judged to be guilty by that\nhighly-gifted lady. Against this Miss Mackenzie had rebelled mildly,\nand since that things had not gone quite so pleasantly with her. She\nhad still been honoured with Mrs Stumfold's card of invitation, and\nhad still gone to the tea-parties on Miss Baker's strenuously-urged\nadvice; but Mrs Stumfold had frowned, and Miss Mackenzie had felt the\nfrown; Mrs Stumfold had frowned, and the retired coachbuilder's wife\nhad at once snubbed the culprit, and Mr Maguire had openly expressed\nhimself to be uneasy.\n\n\"Dearest Miss Mackenzie,\" he had said, with charitable zeal, \"if\nthere has been anything wrong, just beg her pardon, and you will find\nthat everything has been forgotten at once; a more forgiving woman\nthan Mrs Stumfold never lived.\"\n\n\"But suppose I have done nothing to be forgiven,\" urged Miss\nMackenzie.\n\nMr Maguire looked at her, and shook his head, the exact meaning of\nthe look she could not understand, as the peculiarity of his eyes\ncreated confusion; but when he repeated twice to her the same words,\n\"The heart of man is exceeding treacherous,\" she understood that he\nmeant to condemn her.\n\n\"So it is, Mr Maguire, but that is no reason why Mrs Stumfold should\nscold me.\"\n\nThen he got up and left her, and did not speak to her again that\nevening, but he called on her the next day, and was very affectionate\nin his manner. In Mr Stumfold's mode of treating her she had found no\ndifference.\n\nWith Miss Todd, whom she met constantly in the street, and who always\nnodded to her very kindly, she had had one very remarkable interview.\n\n\"I think we had better give it up, my dear,\" Miss Todd had said to\nher. This had been in Miss Baker's drawing-room.\n\n\"Give what up?\" Miss Mackenzie had asked.\n\n\"Any idea of our knowing each other. I'm sure it never can come to\nanything, though for my part I should have been so glad. You see you\ncan't serve God and Mammon, and it is settled beyond all doubt that\nI'm Mammon. Isn't it, Mary?\"\n\nMiss Baker, to whom this appeal was made, answered it only by a sigh.\n\n\"You see,\" continued Miss Todd, \"that Miss Baker is allowed to know\nme, though I am Mammon, for the sake of auld lang syne. There have\nbeen so many things between us that it wouldn't do for us to drop\neach other. We have had the same lovers; and you know, Mary, that\nyou've been very near coming over to Mammon yourself. There's a sort\nof understanding that Miss Baker is not to be required to cut me.\nBut they would not allow that sort of liberty to a new comer; they\nwouldn't, indeed.\"\n\n\"I don't know that anybody would be likely to interfere with me,\"\nsaid Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"Yes, they would, my dear. You didn't quite know yourself which way\nit was to be when you first came here, and if it had been my way,\nI should have been most happy to have made myself civil. You have\nchosen now, and I don't doubt but what you have chosen right. I\nalways tell Mary Baker that it does very well for her, and I dare say\nit will do very well for you too. There's a great deal in it, and\nonly that some of them do tell such lies I think I should have tried\nit myself. But, my dear Miss Mackenzie, you can't do both.\"\n\nAfter this Miss Mackenzie used to nod to Miss Todd in the street, but\nbeyond that there was no friendly intercourse between those ladies.\n\nAt the beginning of December there came an invitation to Miss\nMackenzie to spend the Christmas holidays away from Littlebath, and\nas she accepted this invitation, and as we must follow her to the\nhouse of her friends, we will postpone further mention of the matter\ntill the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nMiss Mackenzie Goes to the Cedars\n\n\nAbout the middle of December Mrs Mackenzie, of Gower Street, received\na letter from her sister-in-law at Littlebath, in which it was\nproposed that Susanna should pass the Christmas holidays with her\nfather and mother. \"I myself,\" said the letter, \"am going for three\nweeks to the Cedars. Lady Ball has written to me, and as she seems\nto wish it, I shall go. It is always well, I think, to drop family\ndissensions.\" The letter said a great deal more, for Margaret\nMackenzie, not having much business on hand, was fond of writing\nlong letters; but the upshot of it was, that she would leave Susanna\nin Gower Street, on her way to the Cedars, and call for her on her\nreturn home.\n\n\"What on earth is she going there for?\" said Mrs Tom Mackenzie.\n\n\"Because they have asked her,\" replied the husband.\n\n\"Of course they have asked her; but that's no reason she should go.\nThe Balls have behaved very badly to us, and I should think much\nbetter of her if she stayed away.\"\n\nTo this Mr Mackenzie made no answer, but simply remarked that he\nwould be rejoiced in having Susanna at home on Christmas Day.\n\n\"That's all very well, my dear,\" said Mrs Tom, \"and of course so\nshall I. But as she has taken the charge of the child I don't think\nshe ought to drop her down and pick her up just whenever she pleases.\nSuppose she was to take it into her head to stop at the Cedars\naltogether, what are we to do then?--just have the girl returned upon\nour hands, with all her ideas of life confused and deranged. I hate\nsuch ways.\"\n\n\"She has promised to provide for Susanna, whenever she may not\ncontinue to give her a home.\"\n\n\"What would such a promise be worth if John Ball got hold of her\nmoney? That's what they're after, as sure as my name is Martha; and\nwhat she's after too, very likely. She was there once before she went\nto Littlebath at all. They want to get their uncle's money back, and\nshe wants to be a baronet's wife.\"\n\nThe same view of the matter was perhaps taken by Mr Rubb, junior,\nwhen he was told that Miss Mackenzie was to pass through London on\nher way to the Cedars, though he did not express his fears openly, as\nMrs Mackenzie had done.\n\n\"Why don't you ask your sister to stay in Gower Street?\" he said to\nhis partner.\n\n\"She wouldn't come.\"\n\n\"You might at any rate ask her.\"\n\n\"What good would it do?\"\n\n\"Well; I don't know that it would do any good; but it wouldn't do any\nharm. Of course it's natural that she should wish to have friends\nabout her; and it will only be natural too that she should marry some\none.\"\n\n\"She may marry whom she pleases for me.\"\n\n\"She will marry whom she pleases; but I suppose you don't want to see\nher money go to the Balls.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't care a straw where her money went,\" said Thomas\nMackenzie, \"if I could only know that this sum which we have had from\nher was properly arranged. To tell you the truth, Rubb, I'm ashamed\nto look my sister in the face.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense. Her money is as right as the bank; and if in such\nmatters as that brothers and sisters can't take liberties with each\nother, who the deuce can?\"\n\n\"In matters of money nobody should ever take a liberty with anybody,\"\nsaid Mr Mackenzie.\n\nHe knew, however, that a great liberty had been taken with his\nsister's money, and that his firm had no longer the power of\nproviding her with the security which had been promised to her.\n\nMr Mackenzie would take no steps, at his partner's instance, towards\narresting his sister in London; but Mr Rubb was more successful\nwith Mrs Mackenzie, with whom, during the last month or two, he had\ncontrived to establish a greater intimacy than had ever previously\nexisted between the two families. He had been of late a good deal in\nGower Street, and Mrs Mackenzie had found him to be a much pleasanter\nand better educated man than she had expected. Such was the language\nin which she expressed her praise of him, though I am disposed to\ndoubt whether she herself was at all qualified to judge of the\neducation of any man. He had now talked over the affairs of Margaret\nMackenzie with her sister-in-law, and the result of that talking\nwas that Mrs Mackenzie wrote a letter to Littlebath, pressing Miss\nMackenzie to stay a few days in Gower Street, on her way through\nLondon. She did this as well as she knew how to do it; but still\nthere was that in the letter which plainly told an apt reader that\nthere was no reality in the professions of affection made in it. Miss\nMackenzie became well aware of the fact as she read her sister's\nwords. Available hypocrisy is a quality very difficult of attainment\nand of all hypocrisies, epistolatory hypocrisy is perhaps the\nmost difficult. A man or woman must have studied the matter very\nthoroughly, or be possessed of great natural advantages in that\ndirection, who can so fill a letter with false expressions of\naffection, as to make any reader believe them to be true. Mrs\nMackenzie was possessed of no such skill.\n\n\"Believe her to be my affectionate sister-in-law! I won't believe\nher to be anything of the kind,\" Margaret so spoke of the writer to\nherself, when she had finished the letter; but, nevertheless, she\nanswered it with kind language, saying that she could not stay in\ntown as she passed through to the Cedars, but that she would pass\none night in Gower Street when she called to pick up Susanna on her\nreturn home.\n\nIt is hard to say what pleasure she promised herself in going to\nthe Cedars, or why she accepted that invitation. She had, in truth,\nliked neither the people nor the house, and had felt herself to\nbe uncomfortable while she was there. I think she felt it to be a\nduty to force herself to go out among people who, though they were\npersonally disagreeable to her, might be socially advantageous. If\nSir John Ball had not been a baronet, the call to the Cedars would\nnot have been so imperative on her. And yet she was not a tufthunter,\nnor a toady. She was doing what we all do,--endeavouring to choose\nher friends from the best of those who made overtures to her\nof friendship. If other things be equal, it is probable that a\nbaronet will be more of a gentleman and a pleasanter fellow than a\nmanufacturer of oilcloth. Who is there that doesn't feel that? It\nis true that she had tried the baronet, and had not found him very\npleasant, but that might probably have been her own fault. She had\nbeen shy and stiff, and perhaps ill-mannered, or had at least accused\nherself of these faults; and therefore she resolved to go again.\n\nShe called with Susanna as she passed through London, and just saw\nher sister-in-law.\n\n\"I wish you could have stayed,\" said Mrs Mackenzie.\n\n\"I will for one night, as I return, on the 10th of January,\" said\nMiss Mackenzie.\n\nMrs Mackenzie could not understand what Mr Rubb had meant by saying\nthat that old maid was soft and pleasant, nor could she understand\nSusanna's love for her aunt. \"I suppose men will put up with anything\nfor the sake of money,\" she said to herself; \"and as for children,\nthe truth is, they'll love anybody who indulges them.\"\n\n\"Aunt is so kind,\" Susanna said. \"She's always kind. If you wake her\nup in the middle of the night, she's kind in a moment. And if there's\nanything good to eat, it will make her eyes quite shine if she sees\nthat anybody else likes it. I have known her sit for half an hour\never so uncomfortable, because she would not disturb the cat.\"\n\n\"Then she must be a fool, my dear,\" said Mrs Mackenzie.\n\n\"She isn't a fool, mamma; I'm quite sure of that,\" said Susanna.\n\nMiss Mackenzie went on to the Cedars, and her mind almost misgave her\nin going there, as she was driven up through the dull brick lodges,\nwhich looked as though no paint had touched them for the last thirty\nyears, up to the front door of the dull brick house, which bore\nalmost as dreary a look of neglect as the lodges. It was a large\nbrick house of three stories, with the door in the middle, and three\nwindows on each side of the door, and a railed area with a kitchen\nbelow the ground. Such houses were built very commonly in the\nneighbourhood of London some hundred and fifty years ago, and they\nmay still be pleasant enough to the eye if there be ivy over them,\nand if they be clean with new paint, and spruce with the outer care\nof gardeners and the inner care of housemaids; but old houses are\noften like old ladies, who require more care in their dressing than\nthey who are younger. Very little care was given to the Cedars, and\nthe place therefore always looked ill-dressed. On the right hand as\nyou entered was the dining-room, and the three windows to the left\nwere all devoted to the hall. Behind the dining-room was Sir John's\nstudy, as he called it, and behind or beyond the hall was the\ndrawing-room, from which four windows looked out into the garden.\nThis might have been a pretty room had any care been taken to make\nanything pretty at the Cedars. But the furniture was old, and the\nsofas were hard, and the tables were rickety, and the curtains which\nhad once been red had become brown with the sun. The dinginess of\nthe house had not struck Miss Mackenzie so forcibly when she first\nvisited it, as it did now. Then she had come almost direct from\nArundel Street, and the house in Arundel Street had itself been very\ndingy. Mrs Stumfold's drawing-rooms were not dingy, nor were her own\nrooms in the Paragon. Her eye had become accustomed to better things,\nand she now saw at once how old were the curtains, and how lamentably\nthe papers wanted to be renewed on the walls. She had, however, been\ndrawn from the neighbouring station to the house in the private\ncarriage belonging to the establishment, and if there was any sense\nof justice in her, it must be presumed that she balanced the good\nthings with the bad.\n\nBut her mind misgave her, not because the house was outwardly dreary,\nbut in fear of the inward dreariness of the people--or in fear\nrather of their dreariness and pride combined. Old Lady Ball, though\nnaturally ill-natured, was not ill-mannered, nor did she give herself\nany special airs; but she knew that she was a baronet's wife, that\nshe kept her carriage, and that it was an obligation upon her to\nmake up for the poverty of her house by some little haughtiness of\ndemeanour. There are women, high in rank, but poor in pocket, so\ngifted with the peculiar grace of aristocracy, that they show by\nevery word spoken, by every turn of the head, by every step taken,\nthat they are among the high ones of the earth, and that money has\nnothing to do with it. Old Lady Ball was not so gifted, nor had she\njust claim to such gifts. But some idea on the subject pervaded her\nmind, and she made efforts to be aristocratic in her poverty. Sir\nJohn was a discontented, cross old man, who had succeeded greatly\nin early life, having been for nearly twenty years in Parliament,\nbut had fallen into adversity in his older days. The loss of that\nvery money of which his niece, Miss Mackenzie was possessed, was,\nin truth, the one great misfortune which he deplored; but that\nmisfortune had had ramifications and extensions with which the reader\nneed not trouble himself; but which, altogether, connected as they\nwere with certain liberal aspirations which he had entertained\nin early life, and certain political struggles made during his\nparliamentary career, induced him to regard himself as a sort of\nPrometheus. He had done much for the world, and the world in return\nhad made him a baronet without any money! He was a very tall, thin,\ngray-haired, old man, stooping much, and worn with age, but still\nendowed with some strength of will, and great capability of making\nhimself unpleasant. His son was a bald-headed, stout man, somewhat\npast forty, who was by no means without cleverness, having done\ngreat things as a young man at Oxford; but in life he had failed.\nHe was a director of certain companies in London, at which he used\nto attend, receiving his guinea for doing so, and he had some small\ncapital,--some remnant of his father's trade wealth, which he nursed\nwith extreme care, buying shares here and there and changing his\nmoney about as his keen outlook into City affairs directed him. I do\nnot suppose that he had much talent for the business, or he would\nhave grown rich; but a certain careful zeal carried him on without\ndirect loss, and gave him perhaps five per cent for his capital,\nwhereas he would have received no more than four and a half had he\nleft it alone and taken his dividends without troubling himself. As\nthe difference did not certainly amount to a hundred a-year, it can\nhardly be said that he made good use of his time. His zeal deserved a\nbetter success. He was always thinking of his money, excusing himself\nto himself and to others by the fact of his nine children. For myself\nI think that his children were no justification to him; as they would\nhave been held to be none, had he murdered and robbed his neighbours\nfor their sake.\n\nThere had been a crowd of girls in the house when Miss Mackenzie had\npaid her former visit to the Cedars,--so many that she had carried\naway no remembrance of them as individuals. But at that time the\neldest son, a youth now just of age, was not at home. This hope of\nthe Balls, who was endeavouring to do at Oxford as his father had\ndone, was now with his family, and came forward to meet his cousin\nas the old carriage was driven up to the door. Old Sir John stood\nwithin, in the hall, mindful of the window air, and Lady Ball, a\nlittle mindful of her dignity, remained at the drawing-room door.\nEven though Miss Mackenzie had eight hundred a-year, and was\nnearly related to the Incharrow family, a further advance than the\ndrawing-room door would be inexpedient; for the lady, with all her\nvirtues, was still sister to the man who dealt in retail oilcloth in\nthe New Road!\n\nMiss Mackenzie thought nothing of this, but was well contented to be\nreceived by her hostess in the drawing-room.\n\n\"It's a dull house to come to, my dear,\" said Lady Ball; \"but blood\nis thicker than water, they say, and we thought that perhaps you\nmight like to be with your cousins at Christmas.\"\n\n\"I shall like it very much,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"I suppose you must find it rather sad, living alone at Littlebath,\naway from all your people?\"\n\n\"I have my niece with me, you know.\"\n\n\"A niece, have you? That's one of the girls from Gower Street, I\nsuppose? It's very kind of you, and I dare say, very proper.\"\n\n\"But Littlebath is a very gay place, I thought,\" said John Ball, the\nthird and youngest of the name. \"We always hear of it at Oxford as\nbeing the most stunning place for parties anywhere near.\"\n\n\"I suppose you play cards every night of your life,\" said the\nbaronet.\n\n\"No; I don't play cards,\" said Miss Mackenzie. \"Many ladies do, but\nI'm not in that set.\"\n\n\"What set are you in?\" said Sir John.\n\n\"I don't think I am in any set. I know Mr Stumfold, the clergyman\nthere, and I go to his house sometimes.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah; I see,\" said Sir John. \"I beg your pardon for mentioning\ncards. I shouldn't have done it, if I had known that you were one of\nMr Stumfold's people.\"\n\n\"I am not one of Mr Stumfold's people especially,\" she said, and then\nshe went upstairs.\n\nThe other John Ball came back from London just in time for\ndinner--the middle one of the three, whom we will call Mr Ball. He\ngreeted his cousin very kindly, and then said a word or two to his\nmother about shares. She answered him, assuming a look of interest in\nhis tidings.\n\n\"I don't understand it; upon my word, I don't,\" said he. \"Some of\nthem will burn their fingers before they've done. I don't dare do it;\nI know that.\"\n\nIn the evening, when John Ball,--or Jack, as he was called in the\nfamily,--had left the drawing-room, and the old man was alone with\nhis son, they discussed the position of Margaret Mackenzie.\n\n\"You'll find she has taken up with the religious people there,\" said\nthe father.\n\n\"It's just what she would do,\" said the son.\n\n\"They're the greatest thieves going. When once they have got their\neyes upon money, they never take them off again.\"\n\n\"She's not been there long enough yet to give any one a hold upon\nher.\"\n\n\"I don't know that, John; but, if you'll take my advice, you'll find\nout the truth at once. She has no children, and if you've made up\nyour mind about it, you'll do no good by delay.\"\n\n\"She's a very nice woman, in her way.\"\n\n\"Yes, she's nice enough. She's not a beauty; eh, John? and she won't\nset the Thames on fire.\"\n\n\"I don't wish her to do so; but I think she'd look after the girls,\nand do her duty.\"\n\n\"I dare say; unless she has taken to run after prayer-meetings every\nhour of her life.\"\n\n\"They don't often do that after they're married, sir.\"\n\n\"Well; I know nothing against her. I never thought much of her\nbrothers, and I never cared to know them. One's dead now, and as for\nthe other, I don't suppose he need trouble you much. If you've made\nup your mind about it, I think you might as well ask her at once.\"\nFrom all which it may be seen that Miss Mackenzie had been invited to\nthe Cedars with a direct object on the part of Mr Ball.\n\nBut though the old gentleman thus strongly advised instant action,\nnothing was done during Christmas week, nor had any hint been given\nup to the end of the year. John Ball, however, had not altogether\nlost his time, and had played the part of middle-aged lover better\nthan might have been expected from one the whole tenor of whose life\nwas so thoroughly unromantic. He did manage to make himself pleasant\nto Miss Mackenzie, and so far ingratiated himself with her that he\nwon much of her confidence in regard to money matters.\n\n\"But that's a very large sum of money?\" he said to her one day as\nthey were sitting together in his father's study. He was alluding to\nthe amount which she had lent to Messrs Rubb and Mackenzie, and had\nbecome aware of the fact that as yet Miss Mackenzie held no security\nfor the loan. \"Two thousand five hundred pounds is a very large sum\nof money.\"\n\n\"But I'm to get five per cent, John.\" They were first cousins, but it\nwas not without some ceremonial difficulty that they had arrived at\neach other's Christian names.\n\n\"My dear Margaret, their word for five per cent is no security. Five\nper cent is nothing magnificent. A lady situated as you are should\nnever part with her money without security--never: but if she does,\nshe should have more than five per cent.\"\n\n\"You'll find it's all right, I don't doubt,\" said Miss Mackenzie,\nwho, however, was beginning to have little inward tremblings of her\nown.\n\n\"I hope so; but I must say, I think Mr Slow has been much to blame.\nI do, indeed.\" Mr Slow was the attorney who had for years acted\nfor Walter Mackenzie and his father, and was now acting for Miss\nMackenzie. \"Will you allow me to go to him and see about it?\"\n\n\"It has not been his fault. He wrote and asked me whether I would let\nthem have it, before the papers were ready, and I said I would.\"\n\n\"But may I ask about it?\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie paused before she answered:\n\n\"I think you had better not, John. Remember that Tom is my own\nbrother, and I should not like to seem to doubt him. Indeed, I do not\ndoubt him in the least--nor yet Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"I can assure you that it is a very bad way of doing business,\" said\nthe anxious lover.\n\nBy degrees she began to like her cousin John Ball. I do not at all\nwish the reader to suppose that she had fallen in love with that\nbald-headed, middle-aged gentleman, or that she even thought of him\nin the light of a possible husband; but she found herself to be\ncomfortable in his company, and was able to make a friend of him.\nIt is true that he talked to her more of money than anything else;\nbut then it was her money of which he talked, and he did it with an\ninterest that could not but flatter her. He was solicitous about her\nwelfare, gave her bits of advice, did one or two commissions for her\nin town, called her Margaret, and was kind and cousinly. The Cedars,\nshe thought, was altogether more pleasant than she had found the\nplace before. Then she told herself that on the occasion of her\nformer visit she had not been there long enough to learn to like the\nplace or the people. Now she knew them, and though she still dreaded\nher uncle and his cross sayings, and though that driving out with her\naunt in the old carriage was tedious, she would have been glad to\nprolong her stay there, had she not bound herself to take Susanna\nback to school at Littlebath on a certain day. When that day came\nnear--and it did come very near before Mr Ball spoke out--they\npressed her to prolong her stay. This was done by both Lady Ball and\nby her son.\n\n\"You might as well remain with us another fortnight,\" said Lady\nBall during one of these drives. It was the last drive which Miss\nMackenzie had through Twickenham lanes during that visit to the\nCedars.\n\n\"I can't do it, aunt, because of Susanna.\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all. You're not to make yourself a slave to\nSusanna.\"\n\n\"But I'm to make myself a mother to her as well as I can.\"\n\n\"I must say you have been rather hasty, my dear. Suppose you were to\nchange your mode of life, what would you do?\"\n\nThen Miss Mackenzie, blushing slightly in the obscure corner of the\ncarriage as she spoke, explained to Lady Ball that clause in her\nagreement with her brother respecting the five hundred pounds.\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said Lady Ball.\n\nThe information thus given had been manifestly distasteful, and the\nconversation was for a while interrupted; but Lady Ball returned to\nher request before they were again at home.\n\n\"I really do think you might stop, Margaret. Now that we have all got\nto know each other, it will be a great pity that it all should be\nbroken up.\"\n\n\"But I hope it won't be broken up, aunt.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean, my dear. When people live so far off they\ncan't see each other constantly; and now you are here, I think you\nmight stay a little longer. I know there is not much attraction--\"\n\n\"Oh, aunt, don't say that! I like being here very much.\"\n\n\"Then, why can't you stay? Write and tell Mrs Tom that she must keep\nSusanna at home for another week or so. It can't matter.\"\n\nTo this Miss Mackenzie made no immediate answer.\n\n\"It is not only for myself I speak, but John likes having you here\nwith his girls; and Jack is so fond of you; and John himself is quite\ndifferent while you are here. Do stay!\"\n\nSaying which Lady Ball put out her hand caressingly on Miss\nMackenzie's arm.\n\n\"I'm afraid I mustn't,\" said Miss Mackenzie, very slowly. \"Much as I\nshould like it, I'm afraid I mustn't do it. I've pledged myself to go\nback with Susanna, and I like to be as good as my word.\"\n\nLady Ball drew herself up.\n\n\"I never went so much out of my way to ask any one to stay in my\nhouse before,\" she said.\n\n\"Dear aunt! don't be angry with me.\"\n\n\"Oh no! I'm not angry. Here we are. Will you get out first?\"\n\nWhereupon Lady Ball descended from the carriage, and walked into the\nhouse with a good deal of dignity.\n\n\"What a wicked old woman she was!\" virtuous readers will say; \"what a\nwicked old woman to endeavour to catch that poor old maid's fortune\nfor her son!\"\n\nBut I deny that she was in any degree a wicked old woman on that\nscore. Why should not the two cousins marry, and do very well\ntogether with their joint means? Lady Ball intended to make a\nbaronet's wife of her. If much was to be taken, was not much also to\nbe given?\n\n\"You are going to stay, are you not?\" Jack said to her that evening,\nas he wished her good-night. She was very fond of Jack, who was a\nnice-looking, smooth-faced young fellow, idolised by his sisters over\nwhom he tyrannised, and bullied by his grandfather, before whom he\nquaked.\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Jack; but you shall come and see me at Littlebath,\nif you will.\"\n\n\"I should like it, of all things; but I do wish you'd stay: the house\nis so much nicer when you are in it!\"\n\nBut of course she could not stay at the request of the young lad,\nwhen she had refused the request of the lad's grandmother.\n\nAfter this she had one day to remain at the Cedars. It was a\nThursday, and on the Friday she was to go to her brother's house on\nher way to Littlebath. On the Thursday morning Mr Ball waylaid her on\nthe staircase, as she came down to breakfast, and took her with him\ninto the drawing-room. There he made his request, standing with her\nin the middle of the room.\n\n\"Margaret,\" he said, \"must you go away and leave us?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I must, John,\" she said.\n\n\"I wish we could make you think better of it.\"\n\n\"Of course I should like to stay, but--\"\n\n\"Yes, there's always a but. I should have thought that, of all people\nin the world, you were the one most able to do just what you please\nwith your time.\"\n\n\"We have all got duties to do, John.\"\n\n\"Of course we have; but why shouldn't it be your duty to make your\nrelations happy? If you could only know how much I like your being\nhere?\"\n\nHad it not been that she did not dare to do that for the son which\nshe had refused to the mother, I think that she would have given way.\nAs it was, she did not know how to yield, after having persevered so\nlong.\n\n\"You are all so kind,\" she said, giving him her hand, \"that it goes\nto my heart to refuse you; but I'm afraid I can't. I do not wish to\ngive my brother's wife cause to complain of me.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Mr Ball, speaking very slowly, \"I must ask this favour\nof you, that you will let me see you alone for half an hour after\ndinner this evening.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"Thank you, Margaret. After tea I will go into the study, and perhaps\nyou will follow me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMiss Mackenzie Leaves the Cedars\n\n\nThere was something so serious in her cousin's request to her, and so\nmuch of gravity in his mode of making it, that Miss Mackenzie could\nnot but think of it throughout the day. On what subject did he wish\nto speak to her in so solemn and special a manner? An idea of the\npossibility of an offer no doubt crossed her mind and fluttered her,\nbut it did not do more than this; it did not remain fixed with her,\nor induce her to resolve what answer she would give if such offer\nwere made. She was afraid to allow herself to think that such a thing\ncould happen, and put the matter away from her,--uneasily, indeed,\nbut still with so much resolution as to leave her with a conviction\nthat she need not give any consideration to such an hypothesis.\n\nAnd she was not at a loss to suggest to herself another subject. Her\ncousin had learned something about her money which he felt himself\nbound to tell her, but which he would not have told her now had she\nconsented to remain at the Cedars. There was something wrong about\nthe loan. This made her seriously unhappy, for she dreaded the\nnecessity of discussing her brother's conduct with her cousin.\n\nDuring the whole of the day Lady Ball was very courteous, but rather\ndistant. Lady Ball had said to herself that Margaret would have\nstayed had she been in a disposition favourable to John Ball's hopes.\nIf she should decline the alliance with which the Balls proposed to\nhonour her, then Lady Ball was prepared to be very cool. There would\nbe an ingratitude in such a proceeding after the open-armed affection\nwhich had been shown to her which Lady Ball could not readily bring\nherself to forgive. Sir John, once or twice during the day, took up\nhis little sarcasms against her supposed religious tendencies at\nLittlebath.\n\n\"You'll be glad to get back to Mr Stumfold,\" he said.\n\n\"I shall be glad to see him, of course,\" she answered, \"as he is a\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Mr Stumfold has a great many lady friends at Littlebath,\" he\ncontinued.\n\n\"Yes, a great many,\" said Miss Mackenzie, understanding well that she\nwas being bullied.\n\n\"What a pity that there can be only one Mrs Stumfold,\" snarled the\nbaronet; \"it's often a wonder to me how women can be so foolish.\"\n\n\"And it's often a wonder to me,\" said Miss Mackenzie, \"how gentlemen\ncan be so ill-natured.\"\n\nShe had plucked up her spirits of late, and had resented Sir John's\nill-humour.\n\nAt the usual hour Mr Ball came home to dinner, and Miss Mackenzie, as\nsoon as she saw him, again became fluttered. She perceived that he\nwas not at his ease, and that made her worse. When he spoke to the\ngirls he seemed hardly to mind what he was saying, and he greeted his\nmother without any whispered tidings as to the share-market of the\nday.\n\nMargaret asked herself if it could be possible that anything was very\nwrong about her own money. If the worst came to the worst she could\nbut have lost that two thousand five hundred pounds and she would be\nable to live well enough without it. If her brother had asked her for\nit, she would have given it to him. She would teach herself to regard\nit as a gift, and then the subject would not make her unhappy.\n\nThey all came down to dinner, and they all went in to tea, and the\ntea-things were taken away, and then John Ball arose. During tea-time\nneither he nor Miss Mackenzie had spoken a word, and when she got up\nto follow him, there was a solemnity about the matter which ought to\nhave been ludicrous to any of those remaining, who might chance to\nknow what was about to happen. It must be supposed that Lady Ball\nat any rate did know, and when she saw her middle-aged niece walk\nslowly out of the room after her middle-aged son, in order that a\nlove proposal might be made from one to the other with advantage,\nshe must, I should think, have perceived the comic nature of the\narrangement. She went on, however, very gravely with her knitting,\nand did not even make an attempt to catch her husband's eye.\n\n\"Margaret,\" said John Ball, as soon as he had shut the study door;\n\"but, perhaps, you had better sit down.\"\n\nThen she sat down, and he came and seated himself opposite to her;\nopposite her, but not so close as to give him any of the advantages\nof a lover.\n\n\"Margaret, I don't know whether you have guessed the subject on which\nI wish to speak to you; but I wish you had.\"\n\n\"Is it about the money?\" she asked.\n\n\"The money! What money? The money you have lent to your brother? Oh,\nno.\"\n\nThen, at that moment, Margaret did, I think, guess.\n\n\"It's not at all about the money,\" he said, and then he sighed.\n\nHe had at one time thought of asking his mother to make the\nproposition for him, and now he wished that he had done so.\n\n\"No, Margaret, it's something else that I want to say. I believe you\nknow my condition in life pretty accurately.\"\n\n\"In what way, John?\"\n\n\"I am a poor man; considering my large family, a very poor man. I\nhave between eight and nine hundred a year, and when my father and\nmother are both gone I shall have nearly as much more; but I have\nnine children, and as I must keep up something of a position, I have\na hard time of it sometimes, I can tell you.\"\n\nHere he paused, as though he expected her to say something; but she\nhad nothing to say and he went on.\n\n\"Jack is at Oxford, as you know, and I wish to give him any chance\nthat a good education may afford. It did not do much for me, but he\nmay be more lucky. When my father is dead, I think I shall sell this\nplace; but I have not quite made up my mind about that;--it must\ndepend on circumstances. As for the girls, you see that I do what I\ncan to educate them.\"\n\n\"They seem to me to be brought up very nicely; nothing could be\nbetter.\"\n\n\"They are good girls, very good girls, and so is Jack a very good\nfellow.\"\n\n\"I love Jack dearly,\" said Miss Mackenzie, who had already come to\na half-formed resolution that Jack Ball should be heir to half her\nfortune, her niece Susanna being heiress to the other half.\n\n\"Do you? I'm so glad of that.\" And there was actually a tear in the\nfather's eye.\n\n\"And so I do the girls,\" said Margaret. \"It's something so nice to\nfeel that one has people really belonging to one that one may love.\nI hope they'll know Susanna some day, for she's a very nice girl,--a\nvery dear girl.\"\n\n\"I hope they will,\" said Mr Ball; but there was not much enthusiasm\nin the expression of this hope.\n\nThen he got up from his chair, and took a turn across the room. \"The\ntruth is, Margaret, that there's no use in my beating about the bush.\nI shan't say what I've got to say a bit the better for delaying it.\nI want you to be my wife, and to be mother to those children. I\nlike you better than any woman I've seen since I lost Rachel, but\nI shouldn't dare to make you such an offer if you had not money of\nyour own. I could not marry unless my wife had money, and I would not\nmarry any woman unless I felt I could love her--not if she had ever\nso much. There! now you know it all. I suppose I have not said it as\nI ought to do, but if you're the woman I take you for that won't make\nmuch difference.\"\n\nFor my part I think that he said what he had to say very well. I do\nnot know that he could have done it much better. I do not know that\nany other form of words would have been more persuasive to the woman\nhe was addressing. Had he said much of his love, or nothing of his\npoverty; or had he omitted altogether any mention of her wealth, her\nheart would have gone against him at once. As it was he had produced\nin her mind such a state of doubt, that she was unable to answer him\non the moment.\n\n\"I know,\" he went on to say, \"that I haven't much to offer you.\" He\nhad now seated himself again, and as he spoke he looked upon the\nground.\n\n\"It isn't that, John,\" she answered; \"you have much more to give than\nI have a right to expect.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"What I offer you is a life of endless trouble and\ncare. I know all about it myself. It's all very well to talk of a\ncompetence and a big house, and if you were to take me, perhaps we\nmight keep the old place on and furnish it again, and my mother\nthinks a great deal about the title. For my part I think it's only\na nuisance when a man has not got a fortune with it, and I don't\nsuppose it will be any pleasure to you to be called Lady Ball. You'd\nhave a life of fret and worry, and would not have half so much money\nto spend as you have now. I know all that, and have thought a deal\nabout it before I could bring myself to speak to you. But, Margaret,\nyou would have duties which would, I think, in themselves, have a\npleasure for you. You would know what to do with your life, and would\nbe of inestimable value to many people who would love you dearly.\nAs for me, I never saw any other woman whom I could bring myself to\noffer as a mother to my children.\" All this he said looking down at\nthe floor, in a low, dull, droning voice, as though every sentence\nspoken were to have been the last. Then he paused, looked into her\nface for a moment, and after that, allowed his eyes again to fall on\nthe ground.\n\nMargaret was, of course, aware that she must make him some answer,\nand she was by no means prepared to give him one that would be\nfavourable. Indeed, she thought she knew that she could not marry\nhim, because she felt that she did not love him with affection of the\nsort which would be due to a husband. She told herself that she must\nrefuse his offer. But yet she wanted time, and above all things, she\nwished to find words which would not be painful to him. His dull\ndroning voice, and the honest recital of his troubles, and of her\ntroubles if she were to share his lot, had touched her more nearly\nthan any vows of love would have done. When he told her of the heavy\nduties which might fall to her lot as his wife, he almost made her\nthink that it might be well for her to marry him, even though she did\nnot love him. \"I hardly know how to answer you, you have taken me so\nmuch by surprise,\" she said.\n\n\"You need not give me an answer at once,\" he replied; \"you can think\nof it.\" As she did not immediately say anything, he presumed that she\nassented to this proposition. \"You won't wonder now,\" he said, \"that\nI wished you to stay here, or that my mother wished it.\"\n\n\"Does Lady Ball know?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, my mother does know.\"\n\n\"What am I to say to her?\"\n\n\"Shall I tell you, Margaret, what to say? Put your arms round her\nneck, and tell her that you will be her daughter.\"\n\n\"No, John; I cannot do that; and perhaps I ought to say now that I\ndon't think it will ever be possible. It has all so surprised me,\nthat I haven't known how to speak; and I am afraid I shall be letting\nyou go from me with a false idea. Perhaps I ought to say at once that\nit cannot be.\"\n\n\"No, Margaret, no. It is much better that you should think of it. No\nharm can come of that.\"\n\n\"There will be harm if you are disappointed.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall be disappointed if you decide against me; but not\nmore violently so, if you do it next week than if you do it now. But\nI do hope that you will not decide against me.\"\n\n\"And what am I to do?\"\n\n\"You can write to me from Littlebath.\"\n\n\"And how soon must I write?\"\n\n\"As soon as you can make up your mind. But, Margaret, do not decide\nagainst me too quickly. I do not know that I shall do myself any good\nby promising you that I will love you tenderly.\" So saying he put out\nhis hand, and she took it; and they stood there looking into each\nother's eyes, as young lovers might have done,--as his son might have\nlooked into those of her daughter, had she been married young and had\nchildren of her own. In the teeth of all those tedious money dealings\nin the City there was some spice of romance left within his bosom\nyet!\n\nBut how was she to get herself out of the room? It would not do for\nsuch a Juliet to stay all the night looking into the eyes of her\nancient Romeo. And how was she to behave herself to Lady Ball, when\nshe should again find herself in the drawing-room, conscious as she\nwas that Lady Ball knew all about it? And how was she to conduct\nherself before all those young people whom she had left there? And\nher proposed father-in-law, whom she feared so much, and in truth\ndisliked so greatly--would he know all about it, and thrust his\nill-natured jokes at her? Her lover should have opened the door for\nher to pass through; but instead of doing so, as soon as she had\nwithdrawn her hand from his, he placed himself on the rug, and leaned\nback in silence against the chimney-piece.\n\n\"I suppose it wouldn't do,\" she said, \"for me to go off to bed\nwithout seeing them.\"\n\n\"I think you had better see my mother,\" he replied, \"else you will\nfeel awkward in the morning.\"\n\nThen she opened the door for herself, and with frightened feet crept\nback to the drawing-room. She could hardly bring herself to open\nthe second door; but when she had done so, her heart was greatly\nreleased, as, looking in, she saw that her aunt was the only person\nthere.\n\n\"Well, Margaret,\" said the old lady, walking up to her; \"well?\"\n\n\"Dear aunt, I don't know what I am to say to you. I don't know what\nyou want.\"\n\n\"I want you to tell me you have consented to become John's wife.\"\n\n\"But I have not consented. Think how sudden it has been, aunt!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I can understand that. You could not tell him at once that\nyou would take him; but you won't mind telling me.\"\n\n\"I would have told him so in an instant, if I had made up my mind. Do\nyou think I would wish to keep him in suspense on such a matter? If\nI could have felt that I could love him as his wife, I would have\ntold him so instantly,--instantly.\"\n\n\"And why not love him as his wife--why not?\" Lady Ball, as she asked\nthe question, was almost imperious in her eagerness.\n\n\"Why not, aunt? It is not easy to answer such a question as that. A\nwoman, I suppose, can't say why she doesn't love a man, nor yet why\nshe does. You see, it's so sudden. I hadn't thought of him in that\nway.\"\n\n\"You've known him now for nearly a year, and you've been in the house\nwith him for the last three weeks. If you haven't seen that he has\nbeen attached to you, you are the only person in the house that has\nbeen so blind.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen it at all, aunt.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are afraid of the responsibility,\" said Lady Ball.\n\n\"I should fear it certainly; but that alone would not deter me. I\nwould endeavour to do my best.\"\n\n\"And you don't like living in the same house with me and Sir John.\"\n\n\"Indeed, yes; you are always good to me; and as to my uncle, I know\nhe does not mean to be unkind. I should not fear that.\"\n\n\"The truth is, I suppose, Margaret, that you do not like to part with\nyour money.\"\n\n\"That's unjust, aunt. I don't think I care more for my money than\nanother woman.\"\n\n\"Then what is it? He can give you a position in the world higher than\nany you could have had a hope to possess. As Lady Ball you will be\nequal in all respects to your own far-away cousin, Lady Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it, aunt.\"\n\n\"Then what is it?\" asked Lady Ball again. \"I suppose you have no\nabsolute objection to be a baronet's wife.\"\n\n\"Suppose, aunt, that I do not love him?\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said the old woman.\n\n\"But it isn't pshaw,\" said Miss Mackenzie. \"No woman ought to marry a\nman unless she feels that she loves him.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Lady Ball again.\n\nThey had both been standing; and as everybody else was gone Miss\nMackenzie had determined that she would go off to bed without\nsettling herself in the room. So she prepared herself for her\ndeparture.\n\n\"I'll say good-night now, aunt. I have still some of my packing to\ndo, and I must be up early.\"\n\n\"Don't be in a hurry, Margaret. I want to speak to you before you\nleave us, and I shall have no other opportunity. Sit down, won't\nyou?\"\n\nThen Miss Mackenzie seated herself, most unwillingly.\n\n\"I don't know that there is anyone nearer to you than I am, my dear;\nat any rate, no woman; and therefore I can say more than any other\nperson. When you talk of not loving John, does that mean--does it\nmean that you are engaged to anyone else?\"\n\n\"No, it does not.\"\n\n\"And it does not mean that there is anyone else whom you are thinking\nof marrying?\"\n\n\"I am not thinking of marrying anyone.\"\n\n\"Or that you love any other man?\"\n\n\"You are cross-questioning me, aunt, more than is fair.\"\n\n\"Then there is some one?\"\n\n\"No, there is nobody. What I say about John I don't say through any\nfeeling for anybody else.\"\n\n\"Then, my dear, I think that a little talk between you and me may\nmake this matter all right. I'm sure you don't doubt John when he\nsays that he loves you very dearly. As for your loving him, of course\nthat would come. It is not as if you two were two young people, and\nthat you wanted to be billing and cooing. Of course you ought to be\nfond of each other, and like each other's company; and I have no\ndoubt that you will. You and I would, of course, be thrown very much\ntogether, and I'm sure I'm very fond of you. Indeed, Margaret, I have\nendeavoured to show that I am.\"\n\n\"You've been very kind, aunt.\"\n\n\"Therefore as to your loving him, I really don't think there need\nbe any doubt about that. Then, my dear, as to the other part of\nthe arrangement,--the money and all that. If you were to have any\nchildren, your own fortune would be settled on them; at least, that\ncould be arranged, if you required it; though, as your fortune all\ncame from the Balls, and is the very money with which the title was\nintended to be maintained, you probably would not be very exacting\nabout that. Stop a moment, my dear, and let me finish before you\nspeak. I want you particularly to think of what I say, and to\nremember that all your money did come from the Balls. It has been\nvery hard upon John,--you must feel that. Look at him with his heavy\nfamily, and how he works for them!\"\n\n\"But my uncle Jonathan died and left his money to my brothers before\nJohn was married. It is twenty-five years ago.\"\n\n\"Well I remember it, my dear! John was just engaged to Rachel, and\nthe marriage was put off because of the great cruelty of Jonathan's\nwill. Of course I am not blaming you.\"\n\n\"I was only ten years old, and uncle Jonathan did not leave me a\npenny. My money came to me from my brother; and, as far as I can\nunderstand, it is nearly double as much as he got from Sir John's\nbrother.\"\n\n\"That may be; but John would have doubled it quite as readily as\nWalter Mackenzie. What I mean to say is this, that as you have the\nmoney which in the course of nature would have come to John, and\nwhich would have been his now if a great injustice had not been\ndone--\"\n\n\"It was done by a Ball, and not by a Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"That does not alter the case in the least. Your feelings should be\njust the same in spite of that. Of course the money is yours and you\ncan do what you like with it. You can give it to young Mr Samuel\nRubb, if you please.\" Stupid old woman! \"But I think you must feel\nthat you should repair the injury which was done, as it is in your\npower to do so. A fine position is offered you. When poor Sir John\ngoes, you will become Lady Ball, and be the mistress of this house,\nand have your own carriage.\" Terribly stupid old woman! \"And you\nwould have friends and relatives always round you, instead of being\nall alone at such a place as Littlebath, which must, I should say,\nbe very sad. Of course there would be duties to perform to the dear\nchildren; but I don't think so ill of you, Margaret, as to suppose\nfor an instant that you would shrink from that. Stop one moment,\nmy dear, and I shall have done. I think I have said all now; but\nI can well understand that when John spoke to you, you could not\nimmediately give him a favourable answer. It was much better to leave\nit till to-morrow. But you can't have any objection to speaking out\nto me, and I really think you might make me happy by saying that it\nshall be as I wish.\"\n\nIt is astonishing the harm that an old woman may do when she goes\nwell to work, and when she believes she can prevail by means of her\nown peculiar eloquence. Lady Ball had so trusted to her own prestige,\nto her own ladyship, to her own carriage and horses, and to the\nrest of it, and had also so misjudged Margaret's ordinary mild\nmanner, that she had thought to force her niece into an immediate\nacquiescence by her mere words. The result, however, was exactly\nthe contrary to this. Had Miss Mackenzie been left to herself after\nthe interview with Mr Ball: had she gone upstairs to sleep upon his\nproposal, without any disturbance to those visions of sacrificial\nduty which his plain statement had produced: had she been allowed\nto leave the house and think over it all without any other argument\nto her than those which he had used, I think that she would have\naccepted him. But now she was up in arms against the whole thing.\nHer mind, clear as it was, was hardly lucid enough to allow of her\nseparating the mother and son at this moment. She was claimed as a\nwife into the family because they thought that they had a right to\nher fortune; and the temptations offered, by which they hoped to\ndraw her into her duty, were a beggarly title and an old coach! No!\nThe visions of sacrificial duty were all dispelled. There was doubt\nbefore, but now there was no doubt.\n\n\"I think I will go to bed, aunt,\" she said very calmly, \"and I will\nwrite to John from Littlebath.\"\n\n\"And cannot you put me out of my suspense?\"\n\n\"If you wish it, yes. I know that I must refuse him. I wish that I\nhad told him so at once, as then there would have been an end of it.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that you have made up your mind?\"\n\n\"Yes, aunt, I do. I should be wrong to marry a man that I do not\nlove; and as for the money, aunt, I must say that I think you are\nmistaken.\"\n\n\"How mistaken?\"\n\n\"You think that I am called upon to put right some wrong that you\nthink was done you by Sir John's brother. I don't think that I am\nunder any such obligation. Uncle Jonathan left his money to his\nsister's children instead of to his brother's children. If his money\nhad come to John, you would not have admitted that we had any claim,\nbecause we were nephews and nieces.\"\n\n\"The whole thing would have been different.\"\n\n\"Well, aunt, I am very tired, and if you'll let me, I'll go to bed.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly.\"\n\nThen, with anything but warm affection, the aunt and niece parted,\nand Miss Mackenzie went to her bed with a firm resolution that she\nwould not become Lady Ball.\n\nIt had been arranged for some time back that Mr Ball was to accompany\nhis cousin up to London by the train; and though under the present\ncircumstances that arrangement was not without a certain amount of\ninconvenience, there was no excuse at hand for changing it. Not a\nword was said at breakfast as to the scenes of last night. Indeed, no\nword could very well have been said, as all the family was present,\nincluding Jack and the girls. Lady Ball was very quiet, and very\ndignified; but Miss Mackenzie perceived that she was always called\n\"Margaret,\" and not \"my dear,\" as had been her aunt's custom. Very\nlittle was said by any one, and not a great deal was eaten.\n\n\"Well; when are we to see you back again?\" said Sir John, as Margaret\narose from her chair on being told that the carriage was there.\n\n\"Perhaps you and my aunt will come down some day and see me at\nLittlebath?\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"No; I don't think that's very likely,\" said Sir John.\n\nThen she kissed all the children, till she came to Jack.\n\n\"I am going to kiss you, too,\" she said to him.\n\n\"No objection in life,\" said Jack. \"I sha'n't complain about that.\"\n\n\"You'll come and see me at Littlebath?\" said she.\n\n\"That I will if you'll ask me.\"\n\nThen she put her face to her aunt, and Lady Ball permitted her cheek\nto be touched. Lady Ball was still not without hope, but she thought\nthat the surest way was to assume a high dignity of demeanour, and\nto exhibit a certain amount of displeasure. She still believed that\nMargaret might be frightened into the match. It was but a mile and a\nhalf to the station, and for that distance Mr Ball and Margaret sat\ntogether in the carriage. He said nothing to her as to his proposal\ntill the station was in view, and then only a word.\n\n\"Think well of it, Margaret, if you can.\"\n\n\"I fear I cannot think well of it,\" she answered. But she spoke so\nlow, that I doubt whether he completely heard her words. The train\nup to London was nearly full, and there he had no opportunity of\nspeaking to her. But he desired no such opportunity. He had said all\nthat he had to say, and was almost well pleased to know that a final\nanswer was to be given to him, not personally, but by letter. His\nmother had spoken to him that morning, and had made him understand\nthat she was not well pleased with Margaret; but she had said nothing\nto quench her son's hopes.\n\n\"Of course she will accept you,\" Lady Ball had said, \"but women like\nher never like to do anything without making a fuss about it.\"\n\n\"To me, yesterday, I thought she behaved admirably,\" said her son.\n\nAt the station at London he put her into the cab that was to take her\nto Gower Street, and as he shook hands with her through the window,\nhe once more said the same words:\n\n\"Think well of it, Margaret, if you can.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMrs Tom Mackenzie's Dinner Party\n\n\nMrs Tom was ever so gracious on the arrival of her sister-in-law, but\neven in her graciousness there was something which seemed to Margaret\nto tell of her dislike. Near relatives, when they are on good terms\nwith each other, are not gracious. Now, Mrs Tom, though she was ever\nso gracious, was by no means cordial. Susanna, however, was delighted\nto see her aunt, and Margaret, when she felt the girl's arms round\nher neck, declared to herself that that should suffice for her,--that\nshould be her love, and it should be enough. If indeed, in after\nyears, she could make Jack love her too, that would be better still.\nThen her mind went to work upon a little marriage scheme that would\nin due time make a baronet's wife of Susanna. It would not suit her\nto become Lady Ball, but it might suit Susanna.\n\n\"We are going to have a little dinner party to-day,\" said Mrs Tom.\n\n\"A dinner party!\" said Margaret. \"I didn't look for that, Sarah.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I ought not to call it a party, for there are only one or\ntwo coming. There's Dr Slumpy and his wife; I don't know whether you\never met Dr Slumpy. He has attended us for ever so long; and there\nis Miss Colza, a great friend of mine. Mademoiselle Colza I ought to\ncall her, because her father was a Portuguese. Only as she never saw\nhim, we call her Miss. And there's Mr Rubb,--Samuel Rubb, junior. I\nthink you met him at Littlebath.\"\n\n\"Yes; I know Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"That's all; and I might as well say how it will be now. Mr Rubb will\ntake you down to dinner. Tom will take Mrs Slumpy, and the doctor\nwill take me. Young Tom,\"--Young Tom was her son, who was now\nbeginning his career at Rubb and Mackenzie's,--\"Young Tom will take\nMiss Colza, and Mary Jane and Susanna will come down by themselves.\nWe might have managed twelve, and Tom did think of asking Mr Handcock\nand one of the other clerks, but he did not know whether you would\nhave liked it.\"\n\n\"I should not have minded it. That is, I should have been very glad\nto meet Mr Handcock, but I don't care about it.\"\n\n\"That's just what we thought, and therefore we did not ask him.\nYou'll remember, won't you, that Mr Rubb takes you down?\" After that\nMiss Mackenzie took her nieces to the Zoological Gardens, leaving\nMary Jane at home to assist her mother in the cares for the coming\nfestival, and thus the day wore itself away till it was time for them\nto prepare themselves for the party.\n\nMiss Colza was the first to come. She was a young lady somewhat older\nthan Miss Mackenzie; but the circumstances of her life had induced\nher to retain many of the propensities of her girlhood. She was as\nyoung looking as curls and pink bows could make her, and was by no\nmeans a useless guest at a small dinner party, as she could chatter\nlike a magpie. Her claims to be called \"Mademoiselle\" were not very\nstrong, as she had lived in Finsbury Square all her life. Her father\nwas connected in trade with the Rubb and Mackenzie firm, and dealt,\nI think, in oil. She was introduced with great ceremony, and having\nheard that Miss Mackenzie lived at Littlebath, went off at score\nabout the pleasures of that delicious place.\n\n\"I do so hate London, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"I lived here all my life, and I can't say I liked it.\"\n\n\"It is such a crowd, isn't it? and yet so dull. Give me Brighton! We\nwere down for a week in November, and it was nice.\"\n\n\"I never saw Brighton.\"\n\n\"Oh, do go to Brighton. Everybody goes there now; you really do see\nthe world at Brighton. Now, in London one sees nothing.\"\n\nThen came in Mr Rubb, and Miss Colza at once turned her attention to\nhim. But Mr Rubb shook Miss Colza off almost unceremoniously, and\nseated himself by Miss Mackenzie. Immediately afterwards arrived\nthe doctor and his wife. The doctor was a very silent man, and as\nTom Mackenzie himself was not given to much talking, it was well\nthat Miss Colza should be there. Mrs Slumpy could take her share in\nconversation with an effort, when duly assisted; but she could not\nlead the van, and required more sprightly aid than her host was\nqualified to give her. Then there was a whisper between Tom and Mrs\nTom and the bell was rung, and the dinner was ordered. Seven had been\nthe time named, and a quarter past seven saw the guests assembled\nin the drawing-room. A very dignified person in white cotton gloves\nhad announced the names, and the same dignified person had taken the\norder for dinner. The dignified person had then retreated downstairs\nslowly, and what was taking place for the next half-hour poor Mrs\nMackenzie, in the agony of her mind, could not surmise. She longed\nto go and see, but did not dare. Even for Dr Slumpy, or even for his\nwife, had they been alone with her she would not have cared much.\nMiss Colza she could have treated with perfect indifference--could\neven have taken her down into the kitchen with her. Rubb, her own\njunior partner, was nothing, and Miss Mackenzie was simply her\nsister-in-law. But together they made a party. Moreover she had on\nher best and stiffest silk gown, and so armed she could not have been\neffective in the kitchen. And so came a silence for some minutes, in\nspite of the efforts of Miss Colza. At last the hostess plucked up\nher courage to make a little effort.\n\n\"Tom,\" she said, \"I really think you had better ring again.\"\n\n\"It will be all right, soon,\" said Tom, considering that upon the\nwhole it would be better not to disturb the gentleman downstairs just\nyet.\n\n\"Upon my word, I never felt it so cold in my life as I did to-day,\"\nhe said, turning on Dr Slumpy for the third time with that remark.\n\n\"Very cold,\" said Dr Slumpy, pulling out his watch and looking at it.\n\n\"I really think you'd better ring the bell,\" said Mrs Tom.\n\nTom, however, did not stir, and after another period of five minutes\ndinner was announced. It may be as well, perhaps, to explain, that\nthe soup had been on the table for the last quarter of an hour or\nmore, but that after placing the tureen on the table, the dignified\ngentleman downstairs had come to words with the cook, and had refused\nto go on further with the business of the night until that ill-used\nwoman acceded to certain terms of his own in reference to the manner\nin which the foods should be served. He had seen the world, and had\nlofty ideas, and had been taught to be a tyrant by the weakness of\nthose among whom his life had been spent. The cook had alleged that\nthe dinner, as regarded the eating of it, would certainly be spoilt.\nAs to that, he had expressed a mighty indifference. If he was to have\nany hand in them, things were to be done according to certain rules,\nwhich, as he said, prevailed in the world of fashion. The cook,\nwho had a temper and who regarded her mistress, stood out long and\nboldly, but when the housemaid, who was to assist Mr Grandairs\nupstairs, absolutely deserted her, and sitting down began to cry,\nsaying: \"Sairey, why don't you do as he tells you? What signifies its\nbeing greasy if it hain't never to go hup?\" then Sarah's courage gave\nway, and Mr Grandairs, with all the conqueror in his bosom, announced\nthat dinner was served.\n\nIt was a great relief. Even Miss Colza's tongue had been silent,\nand Mr Rubb had found himself unable to carry on any further small\ntalk with Miss Mackenzie. The minds of men and women become so\ntuned to certain positions, that they go astray and won't act when\nthose positions are confused. Almost every man can talk for fifteen\nminutes, standing in a drawing-room, before dinner; but where is the\nman who can do it for an hour? It is not his appetite that impedes\nhim, for he could well have borne to dine at eight instead of seven;\nnor is it that matter lacks him, for at other times his eloquence\ndoes not cease to flow so soon. But at that special point of the day\nhe is supposed to talk for fifteen minutes, and if any prolonged call\nis then made upon him, his talking apparatus falls out of order and\nwill not work. You can sit still on a Sunday morning, in the cold,\non a very narrow bench, with no comfort appertaining, and listen for\nhalf an hour to a rapid outflow of words, which, for any purpose\nof instruction or edification, are absolutely useless to you. The\nreading to you of the \"Qu\u00c3\u00a6 genus,\" or \"As in pr\u00c3\u00a6senti,\" could not be\nmore uninteresting. Try to undergo the same thing in your own house\non a Wednesday afternoon, and see where you will be. To those ladies\nand gentlemen who had been assembled in Mrs Mackenzie's drawing-room\nthis prolonged waiting had been as though the length of the sermon\nhad been doubled, or as if it had fallen on them at some unexpected\nand unauthorised time.\n\nBut now they descended, each gentleman taking his allotted lady, and\nColza's voice was again heard. At the bottom of the stairs, just\nbehind the dining-room door, stood the tyrant, looking very great,\nrepressing with his left hand the housemaid who was behind him. She\nhaving observed Sarah at the top of the kitchen stairs telegraphing\nfor assistance, had endeavoured to make her way to her friend while\nTom Mackenzie and Mrs Slumpy were still upon the stairs; but the\ntyrant, though he had seen the cook's distress, had refused and\nsternly kept the girl a prisoner behind him. Ruat dinner, fiat\ngenteel deportment.\n\nThe order of the construction of the dinner was no doubt \u00c3\u00a0 la Russe;\nand why should it not have been so, as Tom Mackenzie either had or\nwas supposed to have as much as eight hundred a year? But I think\nit must be confessed that the architecture was in some degree\ncomposite. It was \u00c3\u00a0 la Russe, because in the centre there was a green\narrangement of little boughs with artificial flowers fixed on them,\nand because there were figs and raisins, and little dishes with dabs\nof preserve on them, all around the green arrangement; but the soups\nand fish were on the table, as was also the wine, though it was\nunderstood that no one was to be allowed to help himself or his\nneighbour to the contents of the bottle. When Dr Slumpy once made\nan attempt at the sherry, Grandairs was down upon him instantly,\nalthough laden at the time with both potatoes and sea-kale; after\nthat he went round and frowned at Dr Slumpy, and Dr Slumpy understood\nthe frown.\n\nThat the soup should be cold, everybody no doubt expected. It was\nclear soup, made chiefly of Marsala, and purchased from the pastry\ncook's in Store Street. Grandairs, no doubt, knew all about it, as he\nwas connected with the same establishment. The fish--Mrs Mackenzie\nhad feared greatly about her fish, having necessarily trusted its\nfate solely to her own cook--was very ragged in its appearance, and\ncould not be very warm; the melted butter too was thick and clotted,\nand was brought round with the other condiments too late to be of\nmuch service; but still the fish was eatable, and Mrs Mackenzie's\nheart, which had sunk very low as the unconsumed soup was carried\naway, rose again in her bosom. Poor woman! she had done her best, and\nit was hard that she should suffer. One little effort she made at the\nmoment to induce Elizabeth to carry round the sauce, but Grandairs\nhad at once crushed it; he had rushed at the girl and taken the\nbutter-boat from her hand. Mrs Mackenzie had seen it all; but what\ncould she do, poor soul?\n\nThe thing was badly managed in every way. The whole hope of\nconversation round the table depended on Miss Colza, and she was\ndeeply offended by having been torn away from Mr Rubb. How could\nshe talk seated between the two Tom Mackenzies? From Dr Slumpy Mrs\nMackenzie could not get a word. Indeed, with so great a weight on\nher mind, how could she be expected to make any great effort in\nthat direction? But Mr Mackenzie might have done something, and she\nresolved that she would tell him so before he slept that night. She\nhad slaved all day in order that he might appear respectable before\nhis own relatives, at the bottom of his own table--and now he would\ndo nothing! \"I believe he is thinking of his own dinner!\" she said to\nherself. If her accusation was just his thoughts must have been very\nsad.\n\nIn a quiet way Mr Rubb did talk to his neighbour. Upstairs he had\nspoken a word or two about Littlebath, saying how glad he was that\nhe had been there. He should always remember Littlebath as one of\nthe pleasantest places he had ever seen. He wished that he lived\nat Littlebath; but then what was the good of his wishing anything,\nknowing as he did that he was bound for life to Rubb and Mackenzie's\ncounting house!\n\n\"And you will earn your livelihood there,\" Miss Mackenzie had\nreplied.\n\n\"Yes; and something more than that I hope. I don't mind telling\nyou,--a friend like you,--that I will either spoil a horn or make a\nspoon. I won't go on in the old groove, which hardly gives any of us\nsalt to our porridge. If I understand anything of English commerce, I\nthink I can see my way to better things than that.\" Then the period\nof painful waiting had commenced, and he was unable to say anything\nmore.\n\nThat had been upstairs. Now below, amidst all the troubles of Mrs\nMackenzie and the tyranny of Grandairs, he began again:\n\n\"Do you like London dinner parties?\"\n\n\"I never was at one before.\"\n\n\"Never at one before! I thought you had lived in London all your\nlife.\"\n\n\"So I have; but we never used to dine out. My brother was an\ninvalid.\"\n\n\"And do they do the thing well at Littlebath?\"\n\n\"I never dined out there. You think it very odd, I dare say, but I\nnever was at a dinner party in my life--not before this.\"\n\n\"Don't the Balls see much company?\"\n\n\"No, very little; none of that kind.\"\n\n\"Dear me. It comes so often to us here that we get tired of it. I do,\nat least. I'm not always up to this kind of thing. Champagne--if you\nplease. Miss Mackenzie, you will take some champagne?\"\n\nNow had come the crisis of the evening, the moment that was all\nimportant, and Grandairs was making his round in all the pride of his\nvocation. But Mrs Mackenzie was by no means so proud at the present\nconjuncture of affairs. There was but one bottle of champagne. \"So\nlittle wine is drank now, that, what is the good of getting more? Of\ncourse the children won't have it.\" So she had spoken to her husband.\nAnd who shall blame her or say where economy ends, or where meanness\nbegins? She had wanted no champagne herself, but had wished to treat\nher friends well. She had seized a moment after Grandairs had come,\nand Mrs Slumpy was not yet there, to give instructions to the great\nfunctionary.\n\n\"Don't mind me with the champagne, nor yet Mr Tom, nor the young\nladies.\"\n\nThus she had reduced the number to six, and had calculated that\nthe bottle would certainly be good for that number, with probably\na second glass for the doctor and Mr Rubb. But Grandairs had not\ncondescended to be put out of his way by such orders as these. The\nbottle had first come to Miss Colza, and then Tom's glass had been\nfilled, and Susanna's--through no fault of theirs, innocent bairns,\n\"but on purpose!\" as Mrs Mackenzie afterwards declared to her husband\nwhen speaking of the man's iniquity. And I think it had been done on\npurpose. The same thing occurred with Mary Jane--till Mrs Mackenzie,\nlooking on, could have cried. The girl's glass was filled full, and\nshe did give a little shriek at last. But what availed shrieking?\nWhen the bottle came round behind Mrs Mackenzie back to Dr Slumpy, it\nwas dry, and the wicked wretch held the useless nozzle triumphantly\nover the doctor's glass.\n\n\"Give me some sherry, then,\" said the doctor.\n\nThe little dishes which had been brought round after the fish, three\nin number,--and they in the proper order of things should have been\nspoken of before the champagne,--had been in their way successful.\nThey had been so fabricated, that all they who attempted to eat\nof their contents became at once aware that they had got hold of\nsomething very nasty, something that could hardly have been intended\nby Christian cooks as food for men; but, nevertheless, there had\nbeen something of glory attending them. Little dishes require no\nconcomitant vegetables, and therefore there had been no scrambling.\nGrandairs brought one round after the other with much majesty, while\nElizabeth stood behind looking on in wonder. After the second little\ndish Grandairs changed the plates, so that it was possible to partake\nof two, a feat which was performed by Tom Mackenzie the younger. At\nthis period Mrs Mackenzie, striving hard for equanimity, attempted\na word or two with the doctor. But immediately upon that came the\naffair of the champagne, and she was crushed, never to rise again.\n\nMr Rubb at this time had settled down into so pleasant a little\nseries of whispers with his neighbour, that Miss Colza resolved once\nmore to exert herself, not with the praiseworthy desire of assisting\nher friend Mrs Mackenzie, but with malice prepense in reference to\nMiss Mackenzie.\n\nMiss Mackenzie seemed to be having \"a good time\" with her neighbour\nSamuel Rubb, junior, and Miss Colza, who was a woman of courage,\ncould not see that and not make an effort. It cannot be told here\nwhat passages there had been between Mr Rubb and Miss Colza. That\nthere had absolutely been passages I beg the reader to understand.\n\"Mr Rubb,\" she said, stretching across the table, \"do you remember\nwhen, in this very room, we met Mr and Mrs Talbot Green?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, very well,\" said Mr Rubb, and then turning to Miss\nMackenzie, he went on with his little whispers.\n\n\"Mr Rubb,\" continued Miss Colza, \"does anybody put you in mind of Mrs\nTalbot Green?\"\n\n\"Nobody in particular. She was a thin, tall, plain woman, with red\nhair, wasn't she? Who ought she to put me in mind of?\"\n\n\"Oh dear! how can you forget so? That wasn't her looks at all. We\nall agreed that she was quite interesting-looking. Her hair was just\nfair, and that was all. But I shan't say anything more about it.\"\n\n\"But who do you say is like her?\"\n\n\"Miss Colza means Aunt Margaret,\" said Mary Jane.\n\n\"Of course I do,\" said Miss Colza. \"But Mrs Talbot Green was not at\nall the person that Mr Rubb has described; we all thought her very\nnice-looking. Mr Rubb, do you remember how you would go on talking to\nher, till Mr Talbot Green did not like it at all?\"\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you did; and you always do.\"\n\nThen Miss Colza ceased, having finished that effort. But she made\nothers from time to time as long as they remained in the dining-room,\nand by no means gave up the battle. There are women who can fight\nsuch battles when they have not an inch of ground on which to stand.\n\nAfter the little dishes there came, of course, a saddle of mutton,\nand, equally of course, a pair of boiled fowls. There was also a\ntongue; but the \u00c3\u00a0 la Russe construction of the dinner was maintained\nby keeping the tongue on the sideboard, while the mutton and chickens\nwere put down to be carved in the ordinary way. The ladies all\npartook of the chickens, and the gentlemen all of the mutton. The\narrangement was very tedious, as Dr Slumpy was not as clever with\nthe wings of the fowls as he perhaps would have been had he not been\ndefrauded in the matter of the champagne; and then every separate\nplate was carried away to the sideboard with reference to the tongue.\nCurrant jelly had been duly provided, and, if Elizabeth had been\nallowed to dispense it, might have been useful. But Grandairs was too\nmuch for the jelly, as he had been for the fish-sauce, and Dr Slumpy\nin vain looked up, and sighed, and waited. A man in such a condition\nmeasures the amount of cold which his meat may possibly endure\nagainst the future coming of the potatoes, till he falls utterly\nto the ground between two stools. So was it now with Dr Slumpy. He\ngave one last sigh as he saw the gravy congeal upon his plate, but,\nnevertheless, he had finished the unpalatable food before Grandairs\nhad arrived to his assistance.\n\nWhy tell of the ruin of the maccaroni, of the fine-coloured\npyramids of shaking sweet things which nobody would eat, and by the\nnon-consumption of which nothing was gained, as they all went back to\nthe pastrycook's,--or of the ice-puddings flavoured with onions? It\nwas all misery, wretchedness, and degradation. Grandairs was king,\nand Mrs Mackenzie was the lowest of his slaves. And why? Why had she\ndone this thing? Why had she, who, to give her her due, generally\nheld her own in her own house pretty firmly,--why had she lowered her\nneck and made a wretched thing of herself? She knew that it would be\nso when she first suggested to herself the attempt. She did it for\nfashion's sake, you will say. But there was no one there who did\nnot as accurately know as she did herself, how absolutely beyond\nfashion's way lay her way. She was making no fight to enter some\nspecial portal of the world, as a lady may do who takes a house\nsuddenly in Mayfair, having come from God knows where. Her place in\nthe world was fixed, and she made no contest as to the fixing. She\nhoped for no great change in the direction of society. Why on earth\ndid she perplex her mind and bruise her spirit, by giving a dinner \u00c3\u00a0\nla anything? Why did she not have the roast mutton alone, so that all\nher guests might have eaten and have been merry?\n\nShe could not have answered this question herself, and I doubt\nwhether I can do so for her. But this I feel, that unless the\nquestion can get itself answered, ordinary Englishmen must cease to\ngo and eat dinners at each other's houses. The ordinary Englishman,\nof whom we are now speaking, has eight hundred a year; he lives in\nLondon; and he has a wife and three or four children. Had he not\nbetter give it up and go back to his little bit of fish and his leg\nof mutton? Let him do that boldly, and he will find that we, his\nfriends, will come to him fast enough; yes, and will make a gala day\nof it. By Heavens, we have no gala time of it when we go to dine with\nMrs Mackenzie \u00c3\u00a0 la Russe! Lady Mackenzie, whose husband has ever\nso many thousands a year, no doubt does it very well. Money, which\ncannot do everything,--which, if well weighed, cannot in its excess\nperhaps do much,--can do some things. It will buy diamonds and give\ngrand banquets. But paste diamonds, and banquets which are only\nwould-be grand, are among the poorest imitations to which the world\nhas descended.\n\n\"So you really go to Littlebath to-morrow,\" Mr Rubb said to Miss\nMackenzie, when they were again together in the drawing-room.\n\n\"Yes, to-morrow morning. Susanna must be at school the next day.\"\n\n\"Happy Susanna! I wish I were going to school at Littlebath. Then I\nshan't see you again before you go.\"\n\n\"No; I suppose not.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry, because I particularly wished to speak to you,--most\nparticularly. I suppose I could not see you in the morning? But, no;\nit would not do. I could not get you alone without making such a fuss\nof the thing.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you say it now?\" asked Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"I will, if you'll let me; only I suppose it isn't quite the thing to\ntalk about business at an evening party; and your sister-in-law, if\nshe knew it, would never forgive me.\"\n\n\"Then she shan't know it, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"Since you are so good, I think I will make bold. Carpe diem, as\nwe used to say at school, which means that one day is as good as\nanother, and, if so why not any time in the day? Look here, Miss\nMackenzie--about that money, you know.\"\n\nAnd Mr Rubb got nearer to her on the sofa as he whispered the word\nmoney into her ear. It immediately struck her that her own brother\nTom had said not a word to her about the money, although they had\nbeen together for the best part of an hour before they had gone up to\ndress.\n\n\"I suppose Mr Slow will settle all that,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"Of course;--that is to say, he has nothing further to settle just\nas yet. He has our bond for the money, and you may be sure it's all\nright. The property is purchased, and is ours,--our own at this\nmoment, thanks to you. But landed property is so hard to convey.\nPerhaps you don't understand much about that! and I'm sure I don't.\nThe fact is, the title deeds at present are in other hands, a mere\nmatter of form; and I want you to understand that the mortgage is not\ncompleted for that reason.\"\n\n\"I suppose it will be done soon?\"\n\n\"It may, or it may not; but that won't affect your interest, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of the security.\"\n\n\"Well, the security is not as perfect as it should be. I tell you\nthat honestly; and if we were dealing with strangers we should expect\nto be called on to refund. And we should refund instantly, but at a\ngreat sacrifice, a ruinous sacrifice. Now, I want you to put so much\ntrust in us,--in me, if I may be allowed to ask you to do so,--as to\nbelieve that your money is substantially safe. I cannot explain it\nall now; but the benefit which you have done us is immense.\"\n\n\"I suppose it will all come right, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"It will all come right, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\nThen there was extracted from her something which he was able to take\nas a promise that she would not stir in the matter for a while, but\nwould take her interest without asking for any security as to her\nprincipal.\n\nThe conversation was interrupted by Miss Colza, who came and stood\nopposite to them.\n\n\"Well, I'm sure,\" she said; \"you two are very confidential.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't we be confidential, Miss Colza?\" asked Mr Rubb.\n\n\"Oh, dear! no reason in life, if you both like it.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie was not sure that she did like it. But again she was\nnot sure that she did not, when Mr Rubb pressed her hand at parting,\nand told her that her great kindness had been of the most material\nservice to the firm. \"He felt it,\" he said, \"if nobody else did.\"\nThat also might be a sacrificial duty and therefore gratifying.\n\nThe next morning she and Susanna left Gower Street at eight, spent\nan interesting period of nearly an hour at the railway station, and\nreached Littlebath in safety at one.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nMiss Mackenzie's Philosophy\n\n\nMiss Mackenzie remained quiet in her room for two days after her\nreturn before she went out to see anybody. These last Christmas weeks\nhad certainly been the most eventful period of her life, and there\nwas very much of which it was necessary that she should think. She\nhad, she thought, made up her mind to refuse her cousin's offer; but\nthe deed was not yet done. She had to think of the mode in which she\nmust do it; and she could not but remember, also, that she might\nstill change her mind in that matter if she pleased. The anger\nproduced in her by Lady Ball's claim, as it were, to her fortune,\nhad almost evaporated; but the memory of her cousin's story of his\ntroubles was still fresh. \"I have a hard time of it sometimes, I can\ntell you.\" Those words and others of the same kind were the arguments\nwhich had moved her, and made her try to think that she could love\nhim. Then she remembered his bald head and the weary, careworn look\nabout his eyes, and his little intermittent talk, addressed chiefly\nto his mother, about the money-market,--little speeches made as he\nwould sit with the newspaper in his hand:\n\n\"The Confederate loan isn't so bad, after all. I wish I'd taken a\nfew.\"\n\n\"You know you'd never have slept if you had,\" Lady Ball would answer.\n\nAll this Miss Mackenzie now turned in her mind, and asked herself\nwhether she could be happy in hearing such speeches for the remainder\nof her life.\n\n\"It is not as if you two were young people, and wanted to be billing\nand cooing,\" Lady Ball had said to her the same evening.\n\nMiss Mackenzie, as she thought of this, was not so sure that Lady\nBall was right. Why should she not want billing and cooing as well as\nanother? It was natural that a woman should want some of it in her\nlife, and she had had none of it yet. She had had a lover, certainly,\nbut there had been no billing and cooing with him. Nothing of that\nkind had been possible in her brother Walter's house.\n\nAnd then the question naturally arose to her whether her aunt had\ntreated her justly in bracketing her with John Ball in that matter of\nage. John Ball was ten years her senior; and ten years, she knew, was\na very proper difference between a man and his wife. She was by no\nmeans inclined to plead, even to herself, that she was too young\nto marry her cousin; there was nothing in their ages to interfere,\nif the match was in other respects suitable. But still, was not he\nold for his age, and was not she young for hers? And if she should\nultimately resolve to devote herself and what she had left of\nyouth to his children and his welfare, should not the sacrifice be\nrecognised? Had Lady Ball done well to speak of her as she certainly\nmight well speak of him? Was she beyond all aptitude for billing and\ncooing, if billing and cooing might chance to come in her way?\n\nThinking of this during the long afternoon, when Susanna was at\nschool, she got up and looked at herself in the mirror. She moved up\nher hair from off her ears, knowing where she would find a few that\nwere grey, and shaking her head, as though owning to herself that\nshe was old; but as her fingers ran almost involuntarily across her\nlocks, her touch told her that they were soft and silken; and she\nlooked into her own eyes, and saw that they were bright; and her hand\ntouched the outline of her cheek, and she knew that something of the\nfresh bloom of youth was still there; and her lips parted, and there\nwere her white teeth; and there came a smile and a dimple, and a\nslight purpose of laughter in her eye, and then a tear. She pulled\nher scarf tighter across her bosom, feeling her own form, and then\nshe leaned forward and kissed herself in the glass.\n\nHe was very careworn, soiled as it were with the world, tired out\nwith the dusty, weary life's walk which he had been compelled to\ntake. Of romance in him there was nothing left, while in her the\naptitude for romance had only just been born. It was not only that\nhis head was bald, but that his eye was dull, and his step slow. The\njuices of life had been pressed out of him; his thoughts were all\nof his cares, and never of his hopes. It would be very sad to be\nthe wife of such a man; it would be very sad, if there were no\ncompensation; but might not the sacrificial duties give her that\natonement which she would require? She would fain do something with\nher life and her money,--some good, some great good to some other\nperson. If that good to another person and billing and cooing might\ngo together, it would be very pleasant. But she knew there was danger\nin such an idea. The billing and cooing might lead altogether to\nevil. But there could be no doubt that she would do good service if\nshe married her cousin; her money would go to good purposes, and her\ncare to those children would be invaluable. They were her cousins,\nand would it not be sweet to make of herself a sacrifice?\n\nAnd then--Reader! remember that she was no saint, and that hitherto\nvery little opportunity had been given to her of learning to\ndiscriminate true metal from dross. Then--she thought of Mr Samuel\nRubb, junior. Mr Samuel Rubb, junior, was a handsome man, about\nher own age; and she felt almost sure that Mr Samuel Rubb, junior,\nadmired her. He was not worn out with life; he was not broken with\ncare; he would look forward into the world, and hope for things to\ncome. One thing she knew to be true--he was not a gentleman. But\nthen, why should she care for that? The being a gentleman was not\neverything. As for herself, might there not be strong reason to doubt\nwhether those who were best qualified to judge would call her a lady?\nHer surviving brother kept an oilcloth shop, and the brother with\nwhom she had always lived had been so retired from the world that\nneither he nor she knew anything of its ways. If love could be\ngained, and anything of romance; if some active living mode of life\ncould thereby be opened to her, would it not be well for her to give\nup that idea of being a lady? Hitherto her rank had simply enabled\nher to become a Stumfoldian; and then she remembered that Mr\nMaguire's squint was very terrible! How she should live, what she\nshould do with herself, were matters to her of painful thought; but\nshe looked in the glass again, and resolved that she would decline\nthe honour of becoming Mrs Ball.\n\nOn the following morning she wrote her letter, and it was written\nthus:\n\n\n   7 Paragon, Littlebath, January, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR JOHN,\n\n   I have been thinking a great deal about what you said to\n   me, and I have made up my mind that I ought not to become\n   your wife. I know that the honour you have proposed to me\n   is very great, and that I may seem to be ungrateful in\n   declining it; but I cannot bring myself to feel that sort\n   of love for you which a wife should have for her husband.\n   I hope this will not make you displeased with me. It ought\n   not to do so, as my feelings towards you and to your\n   children are most affectionate.\n\n   I know my aunt will be angry with me. Pray tell her from\n   me, with my best love, that I have thought very much of\n   all she said to me, and that I feel sure that I am doing\n   right. It is not that I should be afraid of the duties\n   which would fall upon me as your wife; but that the woman\n   who undertakes those duties should feel for you a wife's\n   love. I think it is best to speak openly, and I hope that\n   you will not be offended.\n\n   Give my best love to my uncle and aunt, and to the girls,\n   and to Jack, who will, I hope, keep his promise of coming\n   and seeing me.\n\n   Your very affectionate cousin,\n\n   MARGARET MACKENZIE.\n\n\n\"There,\" said John Ball to his mother, when he had read the letter,\n\"I knew it would be so; and she is right. Why should she give up her\nmoney and her comfort and her ease, to look after my children?\"\n\nLady Ball took the letter and read it, and pronounced it to be all\nnonsense.\n\n\"It may be all nonsense,\" said her son; \"but such as it is, it is her\nanswer.\"\n\n\"I suppose you'll have to go down to Littlebath after her,\" said Lady\nBall.\n\n\"I certainly shall not do that. It would do no good; and I'm not\ngoing to persecute her.\"\n\n\"Persecute her! What nonsense you men do talk! As if any woman in her\ncondition could be persecuted by being asked to become a baronet's\nwife. I suppose I must go down.\"\n\n\"I beg that you will not, mother.\"\n\n\"She is just one of those women who are sure to stand off, not\nknowing their own minds. The best creature in the world, and really\nvery clever, but weak in that respect! She has not had lovers when\nshe was young, and she thinks that a man should come dallying about\nher as though she were eighteen. It only wants a little perseverance,\nJohn, and if you'll take my advice, you'll go down to Littlebath\nafter her.\"\n\nBut John, in this matter, would not follow his mother's advice, and\ndeclared that he would take no further steps. \"He was inclined,\" he\nsaid, \"to think that Margaret was right. Why should any woman burden\nherself with nine children?\"\n\nThen Lady Ball said a great deal more about the Ball money, giving it\nas her decided opinion that Margaret owed herself and her money to\nthe Balls. As she could not induce her son to do anything, she wrote\na rejoinder to her niece.\n\n\"My dearest Margaret,\" she said, \"Your letter has made both me and\nJohn very unhappy. He has set his heart upon making you his wife,\nand I don't think will ever hold up his head again if you will\nnot consent. I write now instead of John, because he is so much\noppressed. I wish you had remained here, because then we could have\ntalked it over quietly. Would it not be better for you to be here\nthan living alone at Littlebath? for I cannot call that little girl\nwho is at school anything of a companion. Could you not leave her as\na boarder, and come to us for a month? You would not be forced to\npledge yourself to anything further; but we could talk it over.\"\n\nIt need hardly be said that Miss Mackenzie, as she read this,\ndeclared to herself that she had no desire to talk over her own\nposition with Lady Ball any further.\n\n\"John is afraid,\" the letter went on to say, \"that he offended you\nby the manner of his proposition; and that he said too much about\nthe children, and not enough about his own affection. Of course\nhe loves you dearly. If you knew him as I do, which of course you\ncan't as yet, though I hope you will, you would be aware that no\nconsideration, either of money or about the children, would induce\nhim to propose to any woman unless he loved her. You may take my word\nfor that.\"\n\nThere was a great deal more in the letter of the same kind, in which\nLady Ball pressed her own peculiar arguments; but I need hardly say\nthat they did not prevail with Miss Mackenzie. If the son could not\ninduce his cousin to marry him, the mother certainly never would do\nso. It did not take her long to answer her aunt's letter. She said\nthat she must, with many thanks, decline for the present to return\nto the Cedars, as the charge which she had taken of her niece made\nher presence at Littlebath necessary. As to the answer which she had\ngiven to John, she was afraid she could only say that it must stand.\nShe had felt a little angry with Lady Ball; and though she tried not\nto show this in the tone of her letter, she did show it.\n\n\"If I were you I would never see her or speak to her again,\" said\nLady Ball to her son.\n\n\"Very likely I never shall,\" he replied.\n\n\"Has your love-making with that old maid gone wrong, John?\" the\nfather asked.\n\nBut John Ball was used to his father's ill nature, and never answered\nit.\n\nNothing special to our story occurred at Littlebath during the next\ntwo or three months, except that Miss Mackenzie became more and\nmore intimate with Miss Baker, and more and more anxious to form an\nacquaintance with Miss Todd. With all the Stumfoldians she was on\nterms of mitigated friendship, and always went to Mrs Stumfold's\nfortnightly tea-drinkings. But with no lady there,--always excepting\nMiss Baker,--did she find that she grew into familiarity. With Mrs\nStumfold no one was familiar. She was afflicted by the weight of her\nown position, as we suppose the Queen to be, when we say that her\nMajesty's altitude is too high to admit of friendships. Mrs Stumfold\nnever condescended--except to the bishop's wife who, in return, had\nsnubbed Mrs Stumfold. But living, as she did, in an atmosphere of\nflattery and toadying, it was wonderful how well she preserved her\nequanimity, and how she would talk and perhaps think of herself, as a\npoor, erring human being. When, however, she insisted much upon this\nfact of her humanity, the coachmaker's wife would shake her head, and\nat last stamp her foot in anger, swearing that though everybody was\nof course dust, and grass, and worms; and though, of course, Mrs\nStumfold must, by nature, be included in that everybody; yet dust,\nand grass, and worms nowhere exhibited themselves with so few of\nthe stains of humanity on them as they did within the bosom of Mrs\nStumfold. So that, though the absolute fact of Mrs Stumfold being\ndust, and grass, and worms, could not, in regard to the consistency\nof things, be denied, yet in her dustiness, grassiness, and worminess\nshe was so little dusty, grassy, and wormy, that it was hardly fair,\neven in herself, to mention the fact at all.\n\n\"I know the deceit of my own heart,\" Mrs Stumfold would say.\n\n\"Of course you do, Mrs Stumfold,\" the coachmaker's wife replied. \"It\nis dreadful deceitful, no doubt. Where's the heart that ain't? But\nthere's a difference in hearts. Your deceit isn't hard like most of\n'em. You know it, Mrs Stumfold, and wrestle with it, and get your\nfoot on the neck of it, so that, as one may say, it's always being\nkilled and got the better of.\"\n\nDuring these months Miss Mackenzie learned to value at a very low\nrate the rank of the Stumfoldian circle into which she had been\nadmitted. She argued the matter with herself, saying that the\ncoachbuilder's wife and others were not ladies. In a general way she\nwas, no doubt, bound to assume them to be ladies; but she taught\nherself to think that such ladyhood was not of itself worth a great\ndeal. It would not be worth the while of any woman to abstain from\nhaving some Mr Rubb or the like, and from being the lawful mother\nof children in the Rubb and Mackenzie line of life, for the sake of\nsuch exceptional rank as was to be maintained by associating with\nthe Stumfoldians. And, as she became used to the things and persons\naround her, she indulged herself in a considerable amount of social\nphilosophy, turning over ideas in her mind for which they, who saw\nmerely the lines of her outer life, would hardly have given her\ncredit. After all, what was the good of being a lady? Or was there\nany good in it at all? Could there possibly be any good in making a\nstruggle to be a lady? Was it not rather one of those things which\nare settled for one externally, as are the colour of one's hair and\nthe size of one's bones, and which should be taken or left alone,\nas Providence may have directed? \"One cannot add a cubit to one's\nheight, nor yet make oneself a lady;\" that was the nature of Miss\nMackenzie's argument with herself.\n\nAnd, indeed, she carried the argument further than that. It was well\nto be a lady. She recognised perfectly the delicacy and worth of the\narticle. Miss Baker was a lady; as to that there was no doubt. But,\nthen, might it not also be very well not to be a lady; and might\nnot the advantages of the one position be compensated with equal\nadvantages in the other? It is a grand thing to be a queen; but a\nqueen has no friends. It is fine to be a princess; but a princess has\na very limited choice of husbands. There was something about Miss\nBaker that was very nice; but even Miss Baker was very melancholy,\nand Miss Mackenzie could see that that melancholy had come from\nwasted niceness. Had she not been so much the lady, she might have\nbeen more the woman. And there could be no disgrace in not being a\nlady, if such ladyhood depended on external circumstances arranged\nfor one by Providence. No one blames one's washerwoman for not being\na lady. No one wishes one's housekeeper to be a lady; and people are\ndismayed, rather than pleased, when they find that their tailors'\nwives want to be ladies. What does a woman get by being a lady? If\nfortune have made her so, fortune has done much for her. But the good\nthings come as the natural concomitants of her fortunate position.\nIt is not because she is a lady that she is liked by her peers and\npeeresses. But those choice gifts which have made her a lady have\nmade her also to be liked. It comes from the outside, and for it\nno struggle can usefully be made. Such was the result of Miss\nMackenzie's philosophy.\n\nOne may see that all these self-inquiries tended Rubb-wards. I do not\nmean that they were made with any direct intention on her part to\nreconcile herself to a marriage with Mr Samuel Rubb, or that she even\nthought of such an event as probable. He had said nothing to her to\njustify such thought, and as yet she knew but very little of him.\nBut they all went to reconcile her to that sphere of life which her\nbrother Tom had chosen, and which her brother Walter had despised.\nThey taught her to believe that a firm footing below was better than\nwhat might, after a life's struggle, be found to be but a false\nfooting above. And they were brightened undoubtedly by an idea that\nsome marriage in which she could love and be loved was possible to\nher below, though it would hardly be possible to her above.\n\nHer only disputant on the subject was Miss Baker, and she startled\nthat lady much by the things which she said. Now, with Miss Baker,\nnot to be a lady was to be nothing. It was her weakness, and I may\nalso say her strength. Her ladyhood was of that nature that it took\nno soil from outer contact. It depended, even within her own bosom,\non her own conduct solely, and in no degree on the conduct of those\namong whom she might chance to find herself. She thought it well\nto pass her evenings with Mr Stumfold's people, and he at any rate\nhad the manners of a gentleman. So thinking, she felt in no wise\ndisgraced because the coachbuilder's wife was a vulgar, illiterate\nwoman. But there were things, not bad in themselves, which she\nherself would never have done, because she was a lady. She would have\nbroken her heart rather than marry a man who was not a gentleman. It\nwas not unlady-like to eat cold mutton, and she ate it. But she would\nhave shuddered had she been called on to eat any mutton with a steel\nfork. She had little generous ways with her, because they were the\nways of ladies, and she paid for them from off her own back and out\nof her own dish. She would not go out to tea in a street cab, because\nshe was a lady and alone; but she had no objection to walk, with her\nservant with her if it was dark. No wonder that such a woman was\ndismayed by the philosophy of Miss Mackenzie.\n\nAnd yet they had been brought together by much that was alike in\ntheir dispositions. Miss Mackenzie had now been more than six months\nan inhabitant of Littlebath, and six months at such places is enough\nfor close intimacies. They were both quiet, conscientious, kindly\nwomen, each not without some ambition of activity, but each a little\nastray as to the way in which that activity should be shown. They\nwere both alone in the world, and Miss Baker during the last year or\ntwo had become painfully so from the fact of her estrangement from\nher old friend Miss Todd. They both wished to be religious, having\nstrong faith in the need of the comfort of religion; but neither of\nthem were quite satisfied with the Stumfoldian creed. They had both,\nfrom conscience, eschewed the vanities of the world; but with neither\nwas her conscience quite satisfied that such eschewal was necessary,\nand each regretted to be losing pleasures which might after all be\ninnocent.\n\n\"If I'm to go to the bad place,\" Miss Todd had said to Miss Baker,\n\"because I like to do something that won't hurt my old eyes of an\nevening, I don't see the justice of it. As for calling it gambling,\nit's a falsehood, and your Mr Stumfold knows that as well as I\ndo. I haven't won or lost ten pounds in ten years, and I've no\nmore idea of making money by cards than I have by sweeping the\nchimney. Tell me why are cards wicked? Drinking, and stealing, and\nlying, and backbiting, and naughty love-making,--but especially\nbackbiting--backbiting--backbiting,--those are the things that the\nBible says are wicked. I shall go on playing cards, my dear, till Mr\nStumfold can send me chapter and verse forbidding it.\"\n\nThen Miss Baker, who was no doubt weak, had been unable to answer\nher, and had herself hankered after the flesh-pots of Egypt and the\ndelights of the unregenerated.\n\nAll these things Miss Baker and Miss Mackenzie discussed, and Miss\nBaker learned to love her younger friend in spite of her heterodox\nphilosophy. Miss Mackenzie was going to give a tea-party,--nothing as\nyet having been quite settled, as there were difficulties in the way;\nbut she propounded to Miss Baker the possibility of asking Miss Todd\nand some few of the less conspicuous Toddites. She had her ambition,\nand she wished to see whether even she might not do something to\nlessen the gulf which separated those who loved the pleasures of the\nworld in Littlebath from the bosom of Mr Stumfold.\n\n\"You don't know what you are going to do,\" Miss Baker said.\n\n\"I'm not going to do any harm.\"\n\n\"That's more than you can say, my dear.\" Miss Baker had learnt from\nMiss Todd to call her friends \"my dear.\"\n\n\"You are always so afraid of everything,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"Of course I am;--one has to be afraid. A single lady can't go about\nand do just as she likes, as a man can do, or a married woman.\"\n\n\"I don't know about a man; but I think a single woman ought to be\nable to do more what she likes than a married woman. Suppose Mrs\nStumfold found that I had got old Lady Ruff to meet her, what could\nshe do to me?\"\n\nOld Lady Ruff was supposed to be the wickedest old card-player in all\nLittlebath, and there were strange stories afloat of the things she\nhad done. There were Stumfoldians who declared that she had been\nseen through the blinds teaching her own maid piquet on a Sunday\nafternoon; but any horror will get itself believed nowadays. How\ncould they have known that it was not beggar-my-neighbour? But piquet\nwas named because it is supposed in the Stumfoldian world to be the\nwickedest of all games.\n\n\"I don't suppose she'd do much,\" said Miss Baker; \"no doubt she would\nbe very much offended.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I try to convert Lady Ruff?\"\n\n\"She's over eighty, my dear.\"\n\n\"But I suppose she's not past all hope. The older one is the more one\nought to try. But, of course, I'm only joking about her. Would Miss\nTodd come if you were to ask her?\"\n\n\"Perhaps she would, but I don't think she'd be comfortable; or if she\nwere, she'd make the others uncomfortable. She always does exactly\nwhat she pleases.\"\n\n\"That's just why I think I should like her. I wish I dared to do what\nI pleased! We all of us are such cowards. Only that I don't dare, I'd\ngo off to Australia and marry a sheep farmer.\"\n\n\"You would not like him when you'd got him;--you'd find him very\nrough.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't mind a bit about his being rough. I'd marry a shoe-black\nto-morrow if I thought I could make him happy, and he could make me\nhappy.\"\n\n\"But it wouldn't make you happy.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's just what we don't know. I shan't marry a shoe-black,\nbecause I don't dare. So you think I'd better not ask Miss Todd.\nPerhaps she wouldn't get on well with Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"I had them both together once, my dear, and she made herself quite\nunbearable. You've no idea what kind of things she can say.\"\n\n\"I should have thought Mr Maguire would have given her as good as she\nbrought,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"So he did; and then Miss Todd got up and left him, saying out loud,\nbefore all the company, that it was not fair for him to come and\npreach sermons in such a place as that. I don't think they have ever\nmet since.\"\n\nAll this made Miss Mackenzie very thoughtful. She had thrown herself\ninto the society of the saints, and now there seemed to be no escape\nfor her; she could not be wicked even if she wished it. Having got\ninto her convent, and, as it were, taken the vows of her order, she\ncould not escape from it.\n\n\"That Mr Rubb that I told you of is coming down here,\" she said,\nstill speaking to Miss Baker of her party.\n\n\"Oh, dear! will he be here when you have your friends here?\"\n\n\"That's what I intended; but I don't think I shall ask anybody at\nall. It is so stupid always seeing the same people.\"\n\n\"Mr Rubb is--is--is--?\"\n\n\"Yes; Mr Rubb is a partner in my brother's house, and sells oilcloth,\nand things of that sort, and is not by any means aristocratic. I know\nwhat you mean.\"\n\n\"Don't be angry with me, my dear.\"\n\n\"Angry! I am not a bit angry. Why should I be angry? A man who keeps\na shop is not, I suppose, a gentleman. But then, you know, I don't\ncare about gentlemen,--about any gentleman, or any gentlemen.\"\n\nMiss Baker sighed, and then the conversation dropped. She had always\ncared about gentlemen,--and once in her life, or perhaps twice, had\ncared about a gentleman.\n\nYes; Mr Rubb was coming down again. He had written to say that it was\nnecessary that he should again see Miss Mackenzie about the money.\nThe next morning after the conversation which has just been recorded,\nMiss Mackenzie got another letter about the same money, of which it\nwill be necessary to say more in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nPlenary Absolutions\n\n\nThe letter which Miss Mackenzie received was from old Mr Slow, her\nlawyer; and it was a very unpleasant letter. It was so unpleasant\nthat it made her ears tingle when she read it and remembered that the\nperson to whom special allusion was made was one whom she had taught\nherself to regard as her friend. Mr Slow's letter was as follows:\n\n\n   7 Little St Dunstan Court,\n   April, 186--.\n\n   DEAR MADAM,\n\n   I think it proper to write to you specially, about the\n   loan made by you to Messrs Rubb and Mackenzie, as the sum\n   lent is serious, and as there has been conduct on the part\n   of some one which I regard as dishonest. I find that what\n   we have done in the matter has been regulated rather by\n   the fact that you and Mr Mackenzie are brother and sister,\n   than by the ordinary course of such business; and I\n   perceive that we had special warrant given to us for this\n   by you in your letter of the 23rd November last; but,\n   nevertheless, it is my duty to explain to you that Messrs\n   Rubb and Mackenzie, or,--as I believe to be the case, Mr\n   Samuel Rubb, junior, of that firm,--have not dealt with\n   you fairly. The money was borrowed for the purpose of\n   buying certain premises, and, I believe, was laid out in\n   that way. But it was borrowed on the special understanding\n   that you, as the lender, were to have the title-deeds of\n   that property, and the first mortgage upon them. It was\n   alleged, when the purchase was being made, that the money\n   was wanted before the mortgage could be effected, and you\n   desired us to advance it. This we did, aware of the close\n   family connection between yourself and one of the firm.\n   Of course, on your instruction, we should have done this\n   had there been no such relationship, but in that case we\n   should have made further inquiry, and, probably, have\n   ventured to advise you. But though the money was so\n   advanced without the completion of the mortgage, it was\n   advanced on the distinct understanding that the security\n   proffered in the first instance was to be forthcoming\n   without delay. We now learn that the property is mortgaged\n   to other parties to its full value, and that no security\n   for your money is to be had.\n\n   I have seen both Mr Mackenzie and Mr Rubb, junior. As\n   regards your brother, I believe him to have been innocent\n   of any intention of the deceit, for deceit there certainly\n   has been. Indeed, he does not deny it. He offers to\n   give you any security on the business, such as the\n   stock-in-trade or the like, which I may advise you to\n   take. But such would in truth be of no avail to you as\n   security. He, your brother, seemed to be much distressed\n   by what has been done, and I was grieved on his behalf. Mr\n   Rubb,--the younger Mr Rubb,--expressed himself in a very\n   different way. He at first declined to discuss the matter\n   with me; and when I told him that if that was his way I\n   would certainly expose him, he altered his tone a little,\n   expressing regret that there should be delay as to the\n   security, and wishing me to understand that you were\n   yourself aware of all the facts.\n\n   There can be no doubt that deceit has been used towards\n   you in getting your money, and that Mr Rubb has laid\n   himself open to proceedings which, if taken against him,\n   would be absolutely ruinous to him. But I fear they would\n   be also ruinous to your brother. It is my painful duty\n   to tell you that your money so advanced is on a most\n   precarious footing. The firm, in addition to their present\n   liabilities, are not worth half the money; or, I fear I\n   may say, any part of it. I presume there is a working\n   profit, as two families live upon the business. Whether,\n   if you were to come upon them as a creditor, you could get\n   your money out of their assets, I cannot say; but you,\n   perhaps, will not feel yourself disposed to resort to such\n   a measure. I have considered it my duty to tell you all\n   the facts, and though your distinct authority to us to\n   advance the money absolves us from responsibility, I must\n   regret that we did not make further inquiries before we\n   allowed so large a sum of money to pass out of our hands.\n\n   I am, dear Madam,\n   Your faithful servant,\n\n   JONATHAN SLOW.\n\n\nMr Rubb's promised visit was to take place in eight or ten days from\nthe date on which this letter was received. Miss Mackenzie's ears, as\nI have said, tingled as she read it. In the first place, it gave her\na terrible picture of the precarious state of her brother's business.\nWhat would he do,--he with his wife, and all his children, if things\nwere in such a state as Mr Slow described them? And yet a month or\ntwo ago he was giving champagne and iced puddings for dinner! And\nthen what words that discreet old gentleman, Mr Slow, had spoken\nabout Mr Rubb, and what things he had hinted over and above what he\nhad spoken! Was it not manifest that he conceived Mr Rubb to have\nbeen guilty of direct fraud?\n\nMiss Mackenzie at once made up her mind that her money was gone! But,\nin truth, this did not much annoy her. She had declared to herself\nonce before that if anything was wrong about the money she would\nregard it as a present made to her brother; and when so thinking of\nit, she had, undoubtedly, felt that it was, not improbably, lost to\nher. It was something over a hundred a year to be deducted from her\ncomputed income, but she would still be able to live at the Paragon\nquite as well as she had intended, and be able also to educate\nSusanna. Indeed, she could do this easily and still save money, and,\ntherefore, as regarded the probable loss, why need she be unhappy?\n\nBefore the morning was over she had succeeded in white-washing Mr\nRubb in her own mind. It is, I think, certainly the fact that women\nare less pervious to ideas of honesty than men are. They are less\nshocked by dishonesty when they find it, and are less clear in their\nintellect as to that which constitutes honesty. Where is the woman\nwho thinks it wrong to smuggle? What lady's conscience ever pricked\nher in that she omitted the armorial bearings on her silver forks\nfrom her tax papers? What wife ever ceased to respect her husband\nbecause he dealt dishonestly in business? Whereas, let him not go\nto church, let him drink too much wine, let him go astray in his\nconversation, and her wrath arises against these faults. But this\nlack of feminine accuracy in the matter of honesty tends rather to\ncharity in their judgment of others, than to deeds of fraud on the\npart of women themselves.\n\nMiss Mackenzie, who desired nothing that was not her own, who\nscrupulously kept her own hands from all picking and stealing, gave\nherself no peace, after reading the lawyer's letter, till she was\nable to tell herself that Mr Rubb was to be forgiven for what he had\ndone. After all, he had, no doubt, intended that she should have the\npromised security. And had not he himself come to her in London and\ntold her the whole truth,--or, if not the whole truth, as much of\nit as was reasonable to expect that he should be able to tell her\nat an evening party after dinner? Of course Mr Slow was hard upon\nhim. Lawyers always were hard. If she chose to give Messrs Rubb and\nMackenzie two thousand five hundred pounds out of her pocket, what\nwas that to him? So she went on, till at last she was angry with Mr\nSlow for the language he had used.\n\nIt was, however, before all things necessary that she should put Mr\nSlow right as to the facts of the case. She had, no doubt, condoned\nwhatever Mr Rubb had done. Mr Rubb undoubtedly had her sanction for\nkeeping her money without security. Therefore, by return of post, she\nwrote the following short letter, which rather astonished Mr Slow\nwhen he received it--\n\n\n   Littlebath, April, 186--.\n\n   DEAR SIR,\n\n   I am much obliged by your letter about the money; but the\n   truth is that I have known for some time that there was\n   to be no mortgage. When I was in town I saw Mr Rubb at my\n   brother's house, and it was understood between us then\n   that the matter was to remain as it is. My brother and his\n   partner are very welcome to the money.\n\n   Believe me to be,\n   Yours sincerely,\n\n   MARGARET MACKENZIE.\n\n\nThe letter was a false letter; but I suppose Miss Mackenzie did not\nknow that she was writing falsely. The letter was certainly false,\nbecause when she spoke of the understanding \"between us,\" having just\nmentioned her brother and Mr Rubb, she intended the lawyer to believe\nthat the understanding was between them three; whereas, not a word\nhad been said about the money in her brother's hearing, nor was he\naware that his partner had spoken of the money.\n\nMr Slow was surprised and annoyed. As regarded his comfort as a\nlawyer, his client's letter was of course satisfactory. It absolved\nhim not only from all absolute responsibility, but also from the\nfeeling which no doubt had existed within his own breast, that he had\nin some sort neglected the lady's interest. But, nevertheless, he was\nannoyed. He did not believe the statement that Rubb and Mackenzie had\nhad permission to hold the money without mortgage, and thought that\nneither of the partners had themselves so conceived when he had seen\nthem. They had, however, been too many for him--and too many also for\nthe poor female who had allowed herself to be duped out of her money.\nSuch were Mr Slow's feelings on the matter, and then he dismissed the\nsubject from his mind.\n\nThe next day, about noon, Miss Mackenzie was startled almost out of\nher propriety by the sudden announcement at the drawing-room door\nof Mr Rubb. Before she could bethink herself how she would behave\nherself, or whether it would become her to say anything of Mr Slow's\nletter to her, he was in the room.\n\n\"Miss Mackenzie,\" he said, hurriedly--and yet he had paused for a\nmoment in his hurry till the servant had shut the door--\"may I shake\nhands with you?\"\n\nThere could, Miss Mackenzie thought, be no objection to so ordinary\na ceremony; and, therefore, she said, \"Certainly,\" and gave him her\nhand.\n\n\"Then I am myself again,\" said Mr Rubb; and having so said, he sat\ndown.\n\nMiss Mackenzie hoped that there was nothing the matter with him, and\nthen she also sat down at a considerable distance.\n\n\"There is nothing the matter with me,\" said he, \"as you are still so\nkind to me. But tell me, have you not received a letter from your\nlawyer?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have.\"\n\n\"And he has done all in his power to blacken me? I know it. Tell me,\nMiss Mackenzie, has he not blackened me? Has he not laid things to\nmy charge of which I am incapable? Has he not accused me of getting\nmoney from you under false pretences,--than do which, I'd sooner have\nseen my own brains blown out? I would, indeed.\"\n\n\"He has written to me about the money, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"Yes; he came to me, and behaved shamefully to me; and he saw\nyour brother, too, and has been making all manner of ignominious\ninquiries. Those lawyers can never understand that there can be\nanything of friendly feeling about money. They can't put friendly\nfeelings into their unconscionable bills. I believe the world would\ngo on better if there was no such thing as an attorney in it. I\nwonder who invented them, and why?\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie could give him no information on this point, and\ntherefore he went on:\n\n\"But you must tell me what he has said, and what it is he wants us to\ndo. For your sake, if you ask us, Miss Mackenzie, we'll do anything.\nWe'll sell the coats off our backs, if you wish it. You shall never\nlose one shilling by Rubb and Mackenzie as long as I have anything to\ndo with the firm. But I'm sure you will excuse me if I say that we\ncan do nothing at the bidding of that old cormorant.\"\n\n\"I don't know that there's anything to be done, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"Is not there? Well, it's very generous in you to say so; and you\nalways are generous. I've always told your brother, since I had the\nhonour of knowing you, that he had a sister to be proud of. And, Miss\nMackenzie, I'll say more than that; I've flattered myself that I've\nhad a friend to be proud of. But now I must tell you why I've come\ndown to-day; you know I was to have been here next week. Well, when\nMr Slow came to me and I found what was up, I said to myself at once\nthat it was right you should know exactly--exactly--how the matter\nstands. I was going to explain it next week, but I wouldn't leave you\nin suspense when I knew that that lawyer was going to trouble you.\"\n\n\"It hasn't troubled me, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"Hasn't it though, really? That's so good of you again! Now the\ntruth is--but it's pretty nearly just what I told you that day after\ndinner, when you agreed, you know, to what we had done.\"\n\nHere he paused, as though expecting an answer.\n\n\"Yes, I did agree.\"\n\n\"Just at present, while certain other parties have a right to hold\nthe title-deeds, and I can't quite say how long that may be, we\ncannot execute a mortgage in your favour. The title-deeds represent\nthe property. Perhaps you don't know that.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I know as much as that.\"\n\n\"Well then, as we haven't the title-deeds, we can't execute the\nmortgage. Perhaps you'll say you ought to have the title-deeds.\"\n\n\"No, Mr Rubb, I don't want to say anything of the kind. If my money\ncan be of any assistance to my brother--to my brother and you--you\nare welcome to the use of it, without any mortgage. I will show you a\ncopy of the letter I sent to Mr Slow.\"\n\n\"Thanks; a thousand thanks! and may I see the letter which Mr Slow\nwrote?\"\n\n\"No, I think not. I don't know whether it would be right to show it\nto you.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't think of doing anything about it; that is, resenting it,\nyou know. Only then we should all be on the square together.\"\n\n\"I think I'd better not. Mr Slow, when he wrote it, probably did not\nmean that I should show it to you.\"\n\n\"You're right; you're always right. But you'll let me see your\nanswer.\"\n\nThen Miss Mackenzie went to her desk, and brought him a copy of the\nnote she had written to the lawyer. He read it very carefully, twice\nover; and then she could see, when he refolded the paper, that his\neyes were glittering with satisfaction.\n\n\"Miss Mackenzie, Miss Mackenzie,\" he said, \"I think that you are an\nangel!\"\n\nAnd he did think so. In so much at that moment he was at any rate\nsincere. She saw that he was pleased, and she was pleased herself.\n\n\"There need be no further trouble about it,\" she said; and as she\nspoke she rose from her seat.\n\nAnd he rose, too, and came close to her. He came close to her,\nhesitated for a moment, and then, putting one hand behind her waist,\nthough barely touching her, he took her hand with his other hand. She\nthought that he was going to kiss her lips, and for a moment or two\nhe thought so too; but either his courage failed him or else his\ndiscretion prevailed. Whether it was the one or the other, must\ndepend on the way in which she would have taken it. As it was, he\nmerely raised her hand and kissed that. When she could look into his\nface his eyes were full of tears.\n\n\"The truth is,\" said he, \"that you have saved us from ruin;--that's\nthe real truth. Damn all lying!\"\n\nShe started at the oath, but in an instant she had forgiven him\nthat too. There was a sound of reality about it, which reconciled\nher to the indignity; though, had she been true to her faith as a\nStumfoldian, she ought at least to have fainted at the sound.\n\n\"I hardly know what I am saying, Miss Mackenzie, and I beg your\npardon; but the fact is you could sell us up if you pleased. I didn't\nmean it when I first got your brother to agree as to asking you for\nthe loan; I didn't indeed; but things were going wrong with us, and\njust at that moment they went more wrong than ever; and then came the\ntemptation, and we were able to make everything right by giving up\nthe title-deeds of the premises. That's how it was, and it was I that\ndid it. It wasn't your brother; and though you may forgive me, he\nwon't.\"\n\nThis was all true, but how far the truth should be taken towards\npalliating the deed done, I must leave the reader to decide; and the\nreader will doubtless perceive that the truth did not appear until\nMr Rubb had ascertained that its appearance would not injure him. I\nthink, however, that it came from his heart, and that it should count\nfor something in his favour. The tear which he rubbed from his eye\nwith his hand counted very much in his favour with Miss Mackenzie;\nshe had not only forgiven him now, but she almost loved him for\nhaving given her something to forgive. With many women I doubt\nwhether there be any more effectual way of touching their hearts\nthan ill-using them and then confessing it. If you wish to get the\nsweetest fragrance from the herb at your feet, tread on it and bruise\nit.\n\nShe had forgiven him, and taken him absolutely into favour, and he\nhad kissed her hand, having all but embraced her as he did so; but\non the present occasion he did not get beyond that. He lacked the\naudacity to proceed at once from the acknowledgment of his fault to\na declaration of his love; but I hardly think that he would have\ninjured himself had he done so. He should have struck while the iron\nwas hot, and it was heated now nearly to melting; but he was abashed\nby his own position, and having something real in his heart, having\nsome remnant of generous feeling left about him, he could not make\nsuch progress as he might have done had he been cool enough to\ncalculate all his advantages.\n\n\"Don't let it trouble you any more,\" Miss Mackenzie said, when he had\ndropped her hand.\n\n\"But it does trouble me, and it will trouble me.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, with energy, \"it shall not; let there be an end of\nit. I will write to Tom, and tell him that he is welcome to the\nmoney. Isn't he my brother? You are both welcome to it. If it has\nbeen of service to you, I am very happy that it should be so. And\nnow, Mr Rubb, if you please, we won't have another word about it.\"\n\n\"What am I to say?\"\n\n\"Not another word.\"\n\nIt seemed as though he couldn't speak another word, for he went to\nthe window and stood there silently, looking into the street. As he\ndid so, there came another visitor to Miss Mackenzie, whose ringing\nat the doorbell had not been noticed by them, and Miss Baker was\nannounced while Mr Rubb was still getting the better of his feelings.\nOf course he turned round when he heard the lady's name, and of\ncourse he was introduced by his hostess. Miss Mackenzie was obliged\nto make some apology for the gentleman's presence.\n\n\"Mr Rubb was expected next week, but business brought him down to-day\nunexpectedly.\"\n\n\"Quite unexpectedly,\" said Mr Rubb, making a violent endeavour to\nrecover his equanimity.\n\nMiss Baker looked at Mr Rubb, and disliked him at once. It should be\nremembered that she was twenty years older than Miss Mackenzie, and\nthat she regarded the stranger, therefore, with a saner and more\nphilosophical judgment than her friend could use,--with a judgment on\nwhich the outward comeliness of the man had no undue influence; and\nit should be remembered also that Miss Baker, from early age, and by\nall the association of her youth, had been taught to know a gentleman\nwhen she saw him. Miss Mackenzie, who was by nature the cleverer\nwoman of the two, watched her friend's face, and saw by a glance that\nshe did not like Mr Rubb, and then, within her own bosom, she called\nher friend an old maid.\n\n\"We're having uncommonly fine weather for the time of year,\" said Mr\nRubb.\n\n\"Very fine weather,\" said Miss Baker. \"I've called, my dear, to know\nwhether you'll go in with me next door and drink tea this evening?\"\n\n\"What, with Miss Todd?\" asked Miss Mackenzie, who was surprised at\nthe invitation.\n\n\"Yes, with Miss Todd. It is not one of her regular nights, you know,\nand her set won't be there. She has some old friends with her,--a Mr\nWilkinson, a clergyman, and his wife. It seems that her old enemy and\nyour devoted slave, Mr Maguire, knows Mr Wilkinson, and he's going to\nbe there.\"\n\n\"Mr Maguire is no slave of mine, Miss Baker.\"\n\n\"I thought he was; at any rate his presence will be a guarantee that\nMiss Todd will be on her best behaviour, and that you needn't be\nafraid.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of anything of that sort.\"\n\n\"But will you go?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, if you are going.\"\n\n\"That's right; and I'll call for you as I pass by. I must see her\nnow, and tell her. Good-morning, Sir;\" whereupon Miss Baker bowed\nvery stiffly to Mr Rubb.\n\n\"Good-morning, Ma'am,\" said Mr Rubb, bowing very stiffly to Miss\nBaker.\n\nWhen the lady was gone, Mr Rubb sat himself again down on the sofa,\nand there he remained for the next half-hour. He talked about the\nbusiness of the firm, saying how it would now certainly be improved;\nand he talked about Tom Mackenzie's family, saying what a grand thing\nit was for Susanna to be thus taken in hand by her aunt; and he asked\na question or two about Miss Baker, and then a question or two about\nMr Maguire, during which questions he learned that Mr Maguire was not\nas yet a married man; and from Mr Maguire he got on to the Stumfolds,\nand learned somewhat of the rites and ceremonies of the Stumfoldian\nfaith. In this way he prolonged his visit till Miss Mackenzie began\nto feel that he ought to take his leave.\n\nMiss Baker had gone at once to Miss Todd, and had told that lady that\nMiss Mackenzie would join her tea-party. She had also told how Mr\nRubb, of the firm of Rubb and Mackenzie, was at this moment in Miss\nMackenzie's drawing-room.\n\n\"I'll ask him to come, too,\" said Miss Todd. Then Miss Baker had\nhesitated, and had looked grave.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said Miss Todd.\n\n\"I'm not quite sure you'll like him,\" said Miss Baker.\n\n\"Probably not,\" said Miss Todd; \"I don't like half the people I meet,\nbut that's no reason I shouldn't ask him.\"\n\n\"But he is--that is, he is not exactly--\"\n\n\"What is he, and what is he not, exactly?\" asked Miss Todd.\n\n\"Why, he is a tradesman, you know,\" said Miss Baker.\n\n\"There's no harm that I know of in that,\" said Miss Todd. \"My uncle\nthat left me my money was a tradesman.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Miss Baker, energetically; \"he was a merchant in\nLiverpool.\"\n\n\"You'll find it very hard to define the difference, my dear,\" said\nMiss Todd. \"At any rate I'll ask the man to come;--that is, if it\nwon't offend you.\"\n\n\"It won't in the least offend me,\" said Miss Baker.\n\nSo a note was at once written and sent in to Miss Mackenzie, in which\nshe was asked to bring Mr Rubb with her on that evening. When the\nnote reached Miss Mackenzie, Mr Rubb was still with her.\n\nOf course she communicated to him the invitation. She wished that it\nhad not been sent; she wished that he would not accept it,--though\non that head she had no doubt; but she had not sufficient presence\nof mind to keep the matter to herself and say nothing about it.\nOf course he was only too glad to drink tea with Miss Todd. Miss\nMackenzie attempted some slight manoeuvre to induce Mr Rubb to go\ndirect to Miss Todd's house; but he was not such an ass as that; he\nknew his advantage, and kept it, insisting on his privilege of coming\nthere, to Miss Mackenzie's room, and escorting her. He would have\nto escort Miss Baker also; and things, as he thought, were looking\nwell with him. At last he rose to go, but he made good use of the\nprivilege of parting. He held Miss Mackenzie's hand, and pressed it.\n\n\"You mustn't be angry,\" he said, \"if I tell you that you are the best\nfriend I have in the world.\"\n\n\"You have better friends than me,\" she said, \"and older friends.\"\n\n\"Yes; older friends; but none,--not one, who has done for me so much\nas you have; and certainly none for whom I have so great a regard.\nMay God bless you, Miss Mackenzie!\"\n\n\"May God bless you, too, Mr Rubb!\"\n\nWhat else could she say? When his civility took so decorous a shape,\nshe could not bear to be less civil than he had been, or less\ndecorous. And yet it seemed to her that in bidding God bless him with\nthat warm pressure of the hand, she had allowed to escape from her an\nappearance of affection which she had not intended to exhibit.\n\n\"Thank you; thank you,\" said he; and then at last he went.\n\nShe seated herself slowly in her own chair near the window,--the\nchair in which she was accustomed to sit for many solitary hours, and\nasked herself what it all meant. Was she allowing herself to fall in\nlove with Mr Rubb, and if so, was it well that it should be so? This\nwould be bringing to the sternest proof of reality her philosophical\ntheory on social life. It was all very well for her to hold a bold\nopinion in discussions with Miss Baker as to a \"man being a man\nfor a' that,\" even though he might not be a gentleman; but was she\nprepared to go the length of preferring such a man to all the world?\nWas she ready to go down among the Rubbs, for now and ever, and give\nup the society of such women as Miss Baker? She knew that it was\nnecessary that she should come to some resolve on the matter, as\nMr Rubb's purpose was becoming too clear to her. When an unmarried\ngentleman of forty tells an unmarried lady of thirty-six that she is\nthe dearest friend he has in the world, he must surely intend that\nthey shall, neither of them, remain unmarried any longer. Then\nshe thought also of her cousin, John Ball; and some vague shadow\nof thought passed across her mind also in respect of the Rev. Mr\nMaguire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nMiss Todd Entertains Some Friends at Tea\n\n\nI believe that a desire to get married is the natural state of a\nwoman at the age of--say from twenty-five to thirty-five, and I think\nalso that it is good for the world in general that it should be so. I\nam now speaking, not of the female population at large, but of women\nwhose position in the world does not subject them to the necessity of\nearning their bread by the labour of their hands. There is, I know,\na feeling abroad among women that this desire is one of which it\nis expedient that they should become ashamed; that it will be well\nfor them to alter their natures in this respect, and learn to take\ndelight in the single state. Many of the most worthy women of the day\nare now teaching this doctrine, and are intent on showing by precept\nand practice that an unmarried woman may have as sure a hold on the\nworld, and a position within it as ascertained, as may an unmarried\nman. But I confess to an opinion that human nature will be found to\nbe too strong for them. Their school of philosophy may be graced\nby a few zealous students,--by students who will be subject to the\npersonal influence of their great masters,--but it will not be\nsuccessful in the outer world. The truth in the matter is too clear.\nA woman's life is not perfect or whole till she has added herself to\na husband.\n\nNor is a man's life perfect or whole till he has added to himself a\nwife; but the deficiency with the man, though perhaps more injurious\nto him than its counterpart is to the woman, does not, to the outer\neye, so manifestly unfit him for his business in the world. Nor\ndoes the deficiency make itself known to him so early in life, and\ntherefore it occasions less of regret,--less of regret, though\nprobably more of misery. It is infinitely for his advantage that he\nshould be tempted to take to himself a wife; and, therefore, for\nhis sake if not for her own, the philosophic preacher of single\nblessedness should break up her class-rooms, and bid her pupils go\nand do as their mothers did before them.\n\nThey may as well give up their ineffectual efforts, and know that\nnature is too strong for them. The desire is there; and any desire\nwhich has to be repressed with an effort, will not have itself\nrepressed unless it be in itself wrong. But this desire, though by no\nmeans wrong, is generally accompanied by something of a feeling of\nshame. It is not often acknowledged by the woman to herself, and very\nrarely acknowledged in simple plainness to another. Miss Mackenzie\ncould not by any means bring herself to own it, and yet it was there\nstrong within her bosom. A man situated in outer matters as she was\nsituated, possessed of good means, hampered by no outer demands,\nwould have declared to himself clearly that it would be well for him\nto marry. But he would probably be content to wait a while and would,\nunless in love, feel the delay to be a luxury. But Miss Mackenzie\ncould not confess as much, even to herself,--could not let herself\nknow that she thought as much; but yet she desired to be married, and\ndreaded delay. She desired to be married, although she was troubled\nby some half-formed idea that it would be wicked. Who was she,\nthat she should be allowed to be in love? Was she not an old\nmaid by prescription, and, as it were, by the force of ordained\ncircumstances? Had it not been made very clear to her when she\nwas young that she had no right to fall in love, even with Harry\nHandcock? And although in certain moments of ecstasy, as when she\nkissed herself in the glass, she almost taught herself to think that\nfeminine charms and feminine privileges had not been all denied to\nher, such was not her permanent opinion of herself. She despised\nherself. Why, she knew not; and probably did not know that she did\nso. But, in truth, she despised herself, thinking herself to be too\nmean for a man's love.\n\nShe had been asked to marry him by her cousin Mr Ball, and she had\nalmost yielded. But had she married him it would not have been\nbecause she thought herself good enough to be loved by him, but\nbecause she held herself to be so insignificant that she had no right\nto ask for love. She would have taken him because she could have been\nof use, and because she would have felt that she had no right to\ndemand any other purpose in the world. She would have done this, had\nshe not been deterred by the rude offer of other advantages which had\nwith so much ill judgment been made to her by her aunt.\n\nNow, here was a lover who was not old and careworn, who was\npersonally agreeable to her, with whom something of the customary\nromance of the world might be possible. Should she take him? She knew\nwell that there were drawbacks. Her perceptions had not missed to\nnotice the man's imperfections, his vulgarities, his false promises,\nhis little pushing ways. But why was she to expect him to be perfect,\nseeing, as she so plainly did, her own imperfections? As for her\nmoney, of course he wanted her money. So had Mr Ball wanted her\nmoney. What man on earth could have wished to marry her unless she\nhad had money? It was thus that she thought of herself. And he had\nrobbed her! But that she had forgiven; and, having forgiven it, was\ntoo generous to count it for anything. But, nevertheless, she was\nambitious. Might there not be a better, even than Mr Rubb?\n\nMr Maguire squinted horribly; so horribly that the form and face of\nthe man hardly left any memory of themselves except the memory of\nthe squint. His dark hair, his one perfect eye, his good figure,\nhis expressive mouth, were all lost in that dreadful perversion of\nvision. It was a misfortune so great as to justify him in demanding\nthat he should be judged by different laws than those which are used\nas to the conduct of the world at large. In getting a wife he might\nsurely use his tongue with more freedom than another man, seeing that\nhis eye was so much against him. If he were somewhat romantic in his\ntalk, or even more than romantic, who could find fault with him?\nAnd if he used his clerical vocation to cover the terrors of that\ndistorted pupil, can any woman say that he should be therefore\ncondemned? Miss Mackenzie could not forget his eye, but she thought\nthat she had almost brought herself to forgive it. And, moreover,\nhe was a gentleman, not only by Act of Parliament, but in outward\nmanners. Were she to become Mrs Maguire, Miss Baker would certainly\ncome to her house, and it might be given to her to rival Mrs\nStumfold--in running which race she would be weighted by no Mr\nPeters.\n\nIt is true that Mr Maguire had never asked her to marry him, but she\nbelieved that he would ask her if she gave him any encouragement. Now\nit was to come to pass, by a wonderful arrangement of circumstances,\nthat she was to meet these two gentlemen together. It might well be,\nthat on this very occasion, she must choose whether it should be\neither or neither.\n\nMr Rubb came, and she looked anxiously at his dress. He had on bright\nyellow kid gloves, primrose he would have called them, but, if there\nbe such things as yellow gloves, they were yellow; and she wished\nthat she had the courage to ask him to take them off. This was beyond\nher, and there he sat, with his gloves almost as conspicuous as Mr\nMaguire's eye. Should she, however, ever become Mrs Rubb, she would\nnot find the gloves to be there permanently; whereas the eye would\nremain. But then the gloves were the fault of the one man, whereas\nthe eye was simply the misfortune of the other. And Mr Rubb's hair\nwas very full of perfumed grease, and sat on each side of his head\nin a conscious arrangement of waviness that was detestable. As she\nlooked at Mr Rubb in all the brightness of his evening costume, she\nbegan to think that she had better not. At last Miss Baker came, and\nthey started off together. Miss Mackenzie saw that Miss Baker eyed\nthe man, and she blushed. When they got down upon the doorstep,\nSamuel Rubb, junior, absolutely offered an arm simultaneously to each\nlady! At that moment Miss Mackenzie hated him in spite of her special\ntheory.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Miss Baker, declining the arm; \"it is only a step.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie declined it also.\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" said Mr Rubb. \"If it's only next door it does not\nsignify.\"\n\nMiss Todd welcomed them cordially, gloves and all. \"My dear,\" she\nsaid to Miss Baker, \"I haven't seen you for twenty years. Miss\nMackenzie, this is very kind of you. I hope we sha'n't do you any\nharm, as we are not going to be wicked to-night.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie did not dare to say that she would have preferred to\nbe wicked, but that is what she would have said if she had dared.\n\n\"Mr Rubb, I'm very happy to see you,\" continued Miss Todd, accepting\nher guest's hand, glove and all. \"I hope they haven't made you\nbelieve that you are going to have any dancing, for, if so, they\nhave hoaxed you shamefully.\" Then she introduced them to Mr and Mrs\nWilkinson.\n\nMr Wilkinson was a plain-looking clergyman, with a very pretty wife.\n\"Adela,\" Miss Todd said to Mrs Wilkinson, \"you used to dance, but\nthat's all done with now, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I never danced much,\" said the clergyman's wife, \"but have certainly\ngiven it up now, partly because I have no one to dance with.\"\n\n\"Here's Mr Rubb quite ready. He'll dance with you, I'll be bound, if\nthat's all.\"\n\nMr Rubb became very red, and Miss Mackenzie, when she next took\ncourage to look at him, saw that the gloves had disappeared.\n\nThere came also a Mr and Mrs Fuzzybell, and immediately afterwards Mr\nMaguire, whereupon Miss Todd declared her party to be complete.\n\n\"Mrs Fuzzybell, my dear, no cards!\" said Miss Todd, quite out loud,\nwith a tragic-comic expression in her face that was irresistible. \"Mr\nFuzzybell, no cards!\" Mrs Fuzzybell said that she was delighted to\nhear it. Mr Fuzzybell said that it did not signify. Miss Baker stole\na glance at Mr Maguire, and shook in her shoes. Mr Maguire tried to\nlook as though he had not heard it.\n\n\"Do you play cards much here?\" asked Mr Rubb.\n\n\"A great deal too much, Sir,\" said Miss Todd, shaking her head.\n\n\"Have you many Dissenters in your parish, Mr Wilkinson?\" asked Mr\nMaguire.\n\n\"A good many,\" said Mr Wilkinson.\n\n\"But no Papists?\" suggested Mr Maguire.\n\n\"No, we have no Roman Catholics.\"\n\n\"That is such a blessing!\" said Mr Maguire, turning his eyes up to\nHeaven in a very frightful manner. But he had succeeded for the\npresent in putting down Miss Todd and her cards.\n\nThey were now summoned round the tea-table,--a genuine tea-table at\nwhich it was expected that they should eat and drink. Miss Mackenzie\nwas seated next to Mr Maguire on one side of the table, while Mr Rubb\nsat on the other between Miss Todd and Miss Baker. While they were\nyet taking their seats, and before the operations of the banquet had\ncommenced, Susanna entered the room. She also had been specially\ninvited, but she had not returned from school in time to accompany\nher aunt. The young lady had to walk round the room to shake hands\nwith everybody, and when she came to Mr Rubb, was received with much\naffectionate urgency. He turned round in his chair and was loud in\nhis praises. \"Miss Mackenzie,\" said he, speaking across the table,\n\"I shall have to report in Gower Street that Miss Susanna has become\nquite the lady.\" From that moment Mr Rubb had an enemy close to the\nobject of his affections, who was always fighting a battle against\nhim.\n\nSusanna had hardly gained her seat, before Mr Maguire seized an\nopportunity which he saw might soon be gone, and sprang to his legs.\n\"Miss Todd,\" said he, \"may I be permitted to ask a blessing?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said Miss Todd; \"but I thought one only did that at\ndinner.\"\n\nMr Maguire, however, was not the man to sit down without improving\nthe occasion.\n\n\"And why not for tea also?\" said he. \"Are they not gifts alike?\"\n\n\"Very much alike,\" said Miss Todd, \"and so is a cake at a\npastry-cook's. But we don't say grace over our buns.\"\n\n\"We do, in silence,\" said Mr Maguire, still standing; \"and therefore\nwe ought to have it out loud here.\"\n\n\"I don't see the argument; but you're very welcome.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mr Maguire; and then he said his grace. He said it\nwith much poetic emphasis, and Miss Mackenzie, who liked any little\nadditional excitement, thought that Miss Todd had been wrong.\n\n\"You've a deal of society here, no doubt,\" said Mr Rubb to Miss\nBaker, while Miss Todd was dispensing her tea.\n\n\"I suppose it's much the same as other places,\" said Miss Baker.\n\"Those who know many people can go out constantly if they like it.\"\n\n\"And it's so easy to get to know people,\" said Mr Rubb. \"That's what\nmakes me like these sort of places so much. There's no stiffness\nand formality, and all that kind of thing. Now in London, you don't\nknow your next neighbour, though you and he have lived there for ten\nyears.\"\n\n\"Nor here either, unless chance brings you together.\"\n\n\"Ah; but there is none of that horrid decorum here,\" said Mr Rubb.\n\"There's nothing I hate like decorum. It prevents people knowing each\nother, and being jolly and happy together. Now, the French know more\nabout society than any people, and I'm told they have none of it.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I can't say,\" said Miss Baker.\n\n\"It's given up to them that they've got rid of it altogether,\" said\nMr Rubb.\n\n\"Who have got rid of what?\" asked Miss Todd, who saw that her friend\nwas rather dismayed by the tenor of Mr Rubb's conversation.\n\n\"The French have got rid of decorum,\" said Mr Rubb.\n\n\"Altogether, I believe,\" said Miss Todd.\n\n\"Of course they have. It's given up to them that they have. They're\nthe people that know how to live!\"\n\n\"You'd better go and live among them, if that's your way of\nthinking,\" said Miss Todd.\n\n\"I would at once, only for the business,\" said Mr Rubb. \"If there's\nanything I hate, it's decorum. How pleasant it was for me to be asked\nin to take tea here in this social way!\"\n\n\"But I hope decorum would not have forbidden that,\" said Miss Todd.\n\n\"I rather think it would though, in London.\"\n\n\"Where you're known, you mean?\" asked Miss Todd.\n\n\"I don't know that that makes any difference; but people don't do\nthat sort of thing. Do they, Miss Mackenzie? You've lived in London\nmost of your life, and you ought to know.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie did not answer the appeal that was made to her. She\nwas watching Mr Rubb narrowly, and knew that he was making a fool of\nhimself. She could perceive also that Miss Todd would not spare him.\nShe could forgive Mr Rubb for being a fool. She could forgive him\nfor not knowing the meaning of words, for being vulgar and assuming;\nbut she could hardly bring herself to forgive him in that he did so\nas her friend, and as the guest whom she had brought thither. She\ndid not declare to herself that she would have nothing more to do\nwith him, because he was an ass; but she almost did come to this\nconclusion, lest he should make her appear to be an ass also.\n\n\"What is the gentleman's name?\" asked Mr Maguire, who, under the\nprotection of the urn, was able to whisper into Miss Mackenzie's ear.\n\n\"Rubb,\" said she.\n\n\"Oh, Rubb; and he comes from London?\"\n\n\"He is my brother's partner in business,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"Oh, indeed. A very worthy man, no doubt. Is he staying with--with\nyou, Miss Mackenzie?\"\n\nThen Miss Mackenzie had to explain that Mr Rubb was not staying with\nher,--that he had come down about business, and that he was staying\nat some inn.\n\n\"An excellent man of business; I'm sure,\" said Mr Maguire.\n\"By-the-bye, Miss Mackenzie, if it be not improper to ask, have you\nany share in the business?\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie explained that she had no share in the business; and\nthen blundered on, saying how Mr Rubb had come down to Littlebath\nabout money transactions between her and her brother.\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said Mr Maguire; and before he had done, he knew very\nwell that Mr Rubb had borrowed money of Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"Now, Mrs Fuzzybell, what are we to do?\" said Miss Todd, as soon as\nthe tea-things were gone.\n\n\"We shall do very well,\" said Mrs Fuzzybell; \"we'll have a little\nconversation.\"\n\n\"If we could all banish decorum, like Mr Rubb, and amuse ourselves,\nwouldn't it be nice? I quite agree with you, Mr Rubb; decorum is a\ngreat bore; it prevents our playing cards to-night.\"\n\n\"As for cards, I never play cards myself,\" said Mr Rubb.\n\n\"Then, when I throw decorum overboard, it sha'n't be in company with\nyou, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"We were always taught to think that cards were objectionable.\"\n\n\"You were told they were the devil's books, I suppose,\" said Miss\nTodd.\n\n\"Mother always objected to have them in the house,\" said Mr Rubb.\n\n\"Your mother was quite right,\" said Mr Maguire; \"and I hope that you\nwill never forget or neglect your parent's precepts. I'm not meaning\nto judge you, Miss Todd--\"\n\n\"But that's just what you are meaning to do, Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"Not at all; very far from it. We've all got our wickednesses and\nimperfections.\"\n\n\"No, no, not you, Mr Maguire. Mrs Fuzzybell, you don't think that Mr\nMaguire has any wickednesses and imperfections?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" said Mrs Fuzzybell, tossing her head.\n\n\"Miss Todd,\" said Mr Maguire, \"when I look into my own heart, I see\nwell how black it is. It is full of iniquity; it is a grievous sore\nthat is ever running, and will not be purified.\"\n\n\"Gracious me, how unpleasant!\" said Miss Todd.\n\n\"I trust that there is no one here who has not a sense of her own\nwickedness.\"\n\n\"Or of his,\" said Miss Todd.\n\n\"Or of his,\" and Mr Maguire looked very hard at Mr Fuzzybell. Mr\nFuzzybell was a quiet, tame old gentleman, who followed his wife's\nheels about wherever she went; but even he, when attacked in this\nway, became very fierce, and looked back at Mr Maguire quite as\nseverely as Mr Maguire looked at him.\n\n\"Or of his,\" continued Mr Maguire; \"and therefore far be it from me\nto think hardly of the amusements of other people. But when this\ngentleman tells me that his excellent parent warned him against the\nfascination of cards, I cannot but ask him to remember those precepts\nto his dying bed.\"\n\n\"I won't say what I may do later in life,\" said Mr Rubb.\n\n\"When he becomes like you and me, Mrs Fuzzybell,\" said Miss Todd.\n\n\"When one does get older,\" said Mr Rubb.\n\n\"And has succeeded in throwing off all decorum,\" said Miss Todd.\n\n\"How can you say such things?\" asked Miss Baker, who was shocked by\nthe tenor of the conversation.\n\n\"It isn't I, my dear; it's Mr Rubb and Mr Maguire, between them. One\nsays he has thrown off all decorum and the other declares himself to\nbe a mass of iniquity. What are two poor old ladies like you and I to\ndo in such company?\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie, when she heard Mr Maguire declare himself to be a\nrunning sore, was even more angry with him than with Mr Rubb. He, at\nany rate, should have known better. After all, was not Mr Ball better\nthan either of them, though his head was bald and his face worn with\nthat solemn, sad look of care which always pervaded him?\n\nIn the course of the evening she found herself seated apart from the\ngeneral company, with Mr Maguire beside her. The eye that did not\nsquint was towards her, and he made an effort to be agreeable to her\nthat was not altogether ineffectual.\n\n\"Does not society sometimes make you very sad?\" he said.\n\nSociety had made her sad to-night, and she answered him in the\naffirmative.\n\n\"It seems that people are so little desirous to make other people\nhappy,\" she replied.\n\n\"It was just that idea that was passing through my own mind. Men and\nwomen are anxious to give you the best they have, but it is in order\nthat you may admire their wealth or their taste; and they strive to\nbe witty, amusing, and sarcastic! but that, again, is for the \u00c3\u00a9clat\nthey are to gain. How few really struggle to make those around them\ncomfortable!\"\n\n\"It comes, I suppose, from people having such different tastes,\" said\nMiss Mackenzie, who, on looking round the room, thought that the\npeople assembled there were peculiarly ill-assorted.\n\n\"As for happiness,\" continued Mr Maguire, \"that is not to be looked\nfor from society. They who expect their social hours to be happy\nhours will be grievously disappointed.\"\n\n\"Are you not happy at Mrs Stumfold's?\"\n\n\"At Mrs Stumfold's? Yes;--sometimes, that is; but even there I always\nseem to want something. Miss Mackenzie, has it never occurred to you\nthat the one thing necessary in this life, the one thing--beyond a\nhope for the next, you know, the one thing is--ah, Miss Mackenzie,\nwhat is it?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you mean a competence,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"I mean some one to love,\" said Mr Maguire.\n\nAs he spoke he looked with all the poetic vigour of his better eye\nfull into Miss Mackenzie's face, and Miss Mackenzie, who then could\nsee nothing of the other eye, felt the effect of the glance somewhat\nas he intended that she should feel it. When a lady who is thinking\nabout getting married is asked by a gentleman who is frequently\nin her thoughts whether she does not want some one to love, it is\nnatural that she should presume that he means to be particular; and\nit is natural also that she should be in some sort gratified by that\nparticularity. Miss Mackenzie was, I think, gratified, but she did\nnot express any such feeling.\n\n\"Is not that your idea also?\" said he,--\"some one to love; is not\nthat the great desideratum here below!\" And the tone in which he\nrepeated the last words was by no means ineffective.\n\n\"I hope everybody has that,\" said she.\n\n\"I fear not; not anyone to love with a perfect love. Who does Miss\nTodd love?\"\n\n\"Miss Baker.\"\n\n\"Does she? And yet they live apart, and rarely see each other. They\nthink differently on all subjects. That is not the love of which I am\nspeaking. And you, Miss Mackenzie, are you sure that you love anyone\nwith that perfect all-trusting, love?\"\n\n\"I love my niece Susanna best,\" said she.\n\n\"Your niece, Susanna! She is a sweet child, a sweet girl; she has\neverything to make those love her who know her; but--\"\n\n\"You don't think anything amiss of Susanna, Mr Maguire?\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing; Heaven forbid, dear child! And I think so highly\nof you for your generosity in adopting her.\"\n\n\"I could not do less than take one of them, Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"But I meant a different kind of love from that. Do you feel that\nyour regard for your niece is sufficient to fill your heart?\"\n\n\"It makes me very comfortable.\"\n\n\"Does it? Ah! me; I wish I could make myself comfortable.\"\n\n\"I should have thought, seeing you so much in Mrs Stumfold's house--\"\n\n\"I have the greatest veneration for that woman, Miss Mackenzie! I\nhave sometimes thought that of all the human beings I have ever met,\nshe is the most perfect; she is human, and therefore a sinner, but\nher sins never meet my eyes.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie, who did not herself regard Mrs Stumfold as being so\nmuch better than her neighbours, could not receive this with much\nrapture.\n\n\"But,\" continued Mr Maguire, \"she is as cold--as cold--as cold as\nice.\"\n\nAs the lady in question was another man's wife, this did not seem\nto Miss Mackenzie to be of much consequence to Mr Maguire, but she\nallowed him to go on.\n\n\"Stumfold I don't think minds it; he is of that joyous disposition\nthat all things work to good for him. Even when she's most obdurate\nin her sternness to him--\"\n\n\"Law! Mr Maguire, I did not think she was ever stern to him.\"\n\n\"But she is, very hard. Even then I don't think he minds it much.\nBut, Miss Mackenzie, that kind of companion would not do for me at\nall. I think a woman should be soft and soothing, like a dove.\"\n\nShe did not stop to think whether doves are soothing, but she felt\nthat the language was pretty.\n\nJust at this moment she was summoned by Miss Baker, and looking up\nshe perceived that Mr and Mrs Fuzzybell were already leaving the\nroom.\n\n\"I don't know why you need disturb Miss Mackenzie,\" said Miss Todd,\n\"she has only got to go next door, and she seems very happy just\nnow.\"\n\n\"I would sooner go with Miss Baker,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"Mr Maguire would see you home,\" suggested Miss Todd.\n\nBut Miss Mackenzie of course went with Miss Baker, and Mr Rubb\naccompanied them.\n\n\"Good-night, Mr Rubb,\" said Miss Todd; \"and don't make very bad\nreports of us in London.\"\n\n\"Oh! no; indeed I won't.\"\n\n\"For though we do play cards, we still stick to decorum, as you must\nhave observed to-night.\"\n\nAt Miss Mackenzie's door there was an almost overpowering amount of\naffectionate farewells. Mr Maguire was there as well as Mr Rubb, and\nboth gentlemen warmly pressed the hand of the lady they were leaving.\nMr Rubb was not quite satisfied with his evening's work, because he\nhad not been able to get near to Miss Mackenzie; but, nevertheless,\nhe was greatly gratified by the general manner in which he had been\nreceived, and was much pleased with Littlebath and its inhabitants.\nMr Maguire, as he walked home by himself, assured himself that he\nmight as well now put the question; he had been thinking about it for\nthe last two months, and had made up his mind that matrimony would be\ngood for him.\n\nMiss Mackenzie, as she went to bed, told herself that she might have\na husband if she pleased; but then, which should it be? Mr Rubb's\nmanners were very much against him; but of Mr Maguire's eye she had\ncaught a gleam as he turned from her on the doorsteps, which made her\nthink of that alliance with dismay.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nMrs Stumfold Interferes\n\n\nOn the morning following Miss Todd's tea-party, Mr Rubb called on\nMiss Mackenzie and bade her adieu. He was, he said, going up to\nLondon at once, having received a letter which made his presence\nthere imperative. Miss Mackenzie could, of course, do no more than\nsimply say good-bye to him. But when she had said so he did not even\nthen go at once. He was standing with his hat in hand, and had bade\nher farewell; but still he did not go. He had something to say, and\nshe stood there trembling, half fearing what the nature of that\nsomething might be.\n\n\"I hope I may see you again before long,\" he said at last.\n\n\"I hope you may,\" she replied.\n\n\"Of course I shall. After all that's come and gone, I shall think\nnothing of running down, if it were only to make a morning call.\"\n\n\"Pray don't do that, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"I shall, as a matter of course. But in spite of that, Miss\nMackenzie, I can't go away without saying another word about the\nmoney. I can't indeed.\"\n\n\"There needn't be any more about that, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"But there must be, Miss Mackenzie; there must, indeed; at least, so\nmuch as this. I know I've done wrong about that money.\"\n\n\"Don't talk about it. If I choose to lend it to my brother and you\nwithout security, there's nothing very uncommon in that.\"\n\n\"No; there ain't; at least perhaps there ain't. Though as far as I\ncan see, brothers and sisters out in the world are mostly as hard to\neach other where money is concerned as other people. But the thing\nis, you didn't mean to lend it without security.\"\n\n\"I'm quite contented as it is.\"\n\n\"And I did wrong about it all through; I feel it so that I can't tell\nyou. I do, indeed. But I'll never rest till that money is paid back\nagain. I never will.\"\n\nThen, having said that, he went away. When early on the preceding\nevening he had put on bright yellow gloves, making himself smart\nbefore the eyes of the lady of his love, it must be presumed that\nhe did so with some hope of success. In that hope he was altogether\nbetrayed. When he came and confessed his fraud about the money,\nit must be supposed that in doing so he felt that he was lowering\nhimself in the estimation of her whom he desired to win for his wife.\nBut, had he only known it, he thereby took the most efficacious step\ntowards winning her esteem. The gloves had been nearly fatal to him;\nbut those words,--\"I feel it so that I can't tell you,\" redeemed the\nevil that the gloves had done. He went away, however, saying nothing\nmore then, and failing to strike while the iron was hot.\n\nSome six weeks after this Mrs Stumfold called on Miss Mackenzie,\nmaking a most important visit. But it should be first explained,\nbefore the nature of that visit is described, that Miss Mackenzie had\ntwice been to Mrs Stumfold's house since the evening of Miss Todd's\nparty, drinking tea there on both occasions, and had twice met Mr\nMaguire. On the former occasion they two had had some conversation,\nbut it had been of no great moment. He had spoken nothing then of\nthe pleasures of love, nor had he made any allusion to the dove-like\nsoftness of women. On the second meeting he had seemed to keep aloof\nfrom her altogether, and she had begun to tell herself that that\ndream was over, and to scold herself for having dreamed at all--when\nhe came close up behind and whispered a word in her ear.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"how much I would wish to be with you, but I\ncan't now.\"\n\nShe had been startled, and had turned round, and had found herself\nclose to his dreadful eye. She had never been so close to it before,\nand it frightened her. Then again he came to her just before she\nleft, and spoke to her in the same mysterious way:\n\n\"I will see you in a day or two,\" he said, \"but never mind now;\" and\nthen he walked away. She had not spoken a word to him, nor did she\nspeak a word to him that evening.\n\nMiss Mackenzie had never before seen Mrs Stumfold since her first\nvisit of ceremony, except in that lady's drawing-room, and was\nsurprised when she heard the name announced. It was an understood\nthing that Mrs Stumfold did not call on the Stumfoldians unless she\nhad some great and special reason for doing so,--unless some erring\nsister required admonishing, or the course of events in the life of\nsome Stumfoldian might demand special advice. I do not know that any\nedict of this kind had actually been pronounced, but Miss Mackenzie,\nthough she had not yet been twelve months in Littlebath, knew that\nthis arrangement was generally understood to exist. It was plain\nto be seen by the lady's face, as she entered the room, that some\nspecial cause had brought her now. It wore none of those pretty\nsmiles with which morning callers greet their friends before they\nbegin their first gentle attempts at miscellaneous conversation.\nIt was true that she gave her hand to Miss Mackenzie, but she did\neven this with austerity; and when she seated herself,--not on\nthe sofa as she was invited to do, but on one of the square, hard,\nstraight-backed chairs,--Miss Mackenzie knew well that pleasantness\nwas not to be the order of the morning.\n\n\"My dear Miss Mackenzie,\" said Mrs Stumfold, \"I hope you will pardon\nme if I express much tender solicitude for your welfare.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie was so astonished at this mode of address, and at the\ntone in which it was uttered, that she made no reply to it. The words\nthemselves had in them an intention of kindness, but the voice and\nlook of the lady were, if kind, at any rate not tender.\n\n\"You came among us,\" continued Mrs Stumfold, \"and became one of us,\nand we have been glad to welcome you.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I've been much obliged.\"\n\n\"We are always glad to welcome those who come among us in a proper\nspirit. Society with me, Miss Mackenzie, is never looked upon as an\nend in itself. It is only a means to an end. No woman regards society\nmore favourably than I do. I think it offers to us one of the most\nefficacious means of spreading true gospel teaching. With these views\nI have always thought it right to open my house in a spirit, as I\nhope, of humble hospitality;--and Mr Stumfold is of the same opinion.\nHolding these views, we have been delighted to see you among us, and,\nas I have said already, to welcome you as one of us.\"\n\nThere was something in this so awful that Miss Mackenzie hardly knew\nhow to speak, or let it pass without speaking. Having a spirit of\nher own she did not like being told that she had been, as it were,\nsat upon and judged, and then admitted into Mrs Stumfold's society\nas a child may be admitted into a school after an examination. And\nyet on the spur of the moment she could not think what words might\nbe appropriate for her answer. She sat silent, therefore, and Mrs\nStumfold again went on.\n\n\"I trust that you will acknowledge that we have shown our good will\ntowards you, our desire to cultivate a Christian friendship with you,\nand that you will therefore excuse me if I ask you a question which\nmight otherwise have the appearance of interference. Miss Mackenzie,\nis there anything between you and my husband's curate, Mr Maguire?\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie's face became suddenly as red as fire, but for a\nmoment or two she made no answer. I do not know whether I may as\nyet have succeeded in making the reader understand the strength as\nwell as the weakness of my heroine's character; but Mrs Stumfold\nhad certainly not succeeded in perceiving it. She was accustomed,\nprobably, to weak, obedient women,--to women who had taught\nthemselves to believe that submission to Stumfoldian authority\nwas a sign of advanced Christianity; and in the mild-looking,\nquiet-mannered lady who had lately come among them, she certainly did\nnot expect to encounter a rebel. But on such matters as that to which\nthe female hierarch of Littlebath was now alluding, Miss Mackenzie\nwas not by nature adapted to be submissive.\n\n\"Is there anything between you and Mr Maguire?\" said Mrs Stumfold\nagain. \"I particularly wish to have a plain answer to that question.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie, as I have said, became very red in the face. When it\nwas repeated, she found herself obliged to speak. \"Mrs Stumfold, I do\nnot know that you have any right to ask me such a question as that.\"\n\n\"No right! No right to ask a lady who sits under Mr Stumfold whether\nor not she is engaged to Mr Stumfold's own curate! Think again of\nwhat you are saying, Miss Mackenzie!\" And there was in Mrs Stumfold's\nvoice as she spoke an expression of offended majesty, and in her\ncountenance a look of awful authority, sufficient no doubt to bring\nmost Stumfoldian ladies to their bearings.\n\n\"You said nothing about being engaged to him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Mackenzie!\"\n\n\"You said nothing about being engaged to him, but if you had I should\nhave made the same answer. You asked me if there was anything between\nme and him; and I think it was a very offensive question.\"\n\n\"Offensive! I am afraid, Miss Mackenzie, you have not your spirit\nsubject to a proper control. I have come here in all kindness to warn\nyou against danger, and you tell me that I am offensive! What am I to\nthink of you?\"\n\n\"You have no right to connect my name with any gentleman's. You can't\nhave any right merely because I go to Mr Stumfold's church. It's\nquite preposterous. If I went to Mr Paul's church\"--Mr Paul was a\nvery High Church young clergyman who had wished to have candles in\nhis church, and of whom it was asserted that he did keep a pair of\ncandles on an inverted box in a closet inside his bedroom--\"if I went\nto Mr Paul's church, might his wife, if he had one, come and ask me\nall manner of questions like that?\"\n\nNow Mr Paul's name stank in the nostrils of Mrs Stumfold. He was\nto her the thing accursed. Had Miss Mackenzie quoted the Pope, or\nCardinal Wiseman or even Dr Newman, it would not have been so bad.\nMrs Stumfold had once met Mr Paul, and called him to his face the\nmost abject of all the slaves of the scarlet woman. To this courtesy\nMr Paul, being a good-humoured and somewhat sportive young man,\nhad replied that she was another. Mrs Stumfold had interpreted the\ngentleman's meaning wrongly, and had ever since gnashed with her\nteeth and fired great guns with her eyes whenever Mr Paul was named\nwithin her hearing. \"Ribald ruffian,\" she had once said of him; \"but\nthat he thinks his priestly rags protect him, he would not have dared\nto insult me.\" It was said that she had complained to Stumfold; but\nMr Stumfold's sacerdotal clothing, whether ragged or whole, prevented\nhim also from interfering, and nothing further of a personal nature\nhad occurred between the opponents.\n\nBut Miss Mackenzie, who certainly was a Stumfoldian by her own\nchoice, should not have used the name. She probably did not know\nthe whole truth as to that passage of arms between Mr Paul and Mrs\nStumfold, but she did know that no name in Littlebath was so odious\nto the lady as that of the rival clergyman.\n\n\"Very well, Miss Mackenzie,\" said she, speaking loudly in her wrath;\n\"then let me tell you that you will come by your ruin,--yes, by your\nruin. You poor unfortunate woman, you are unfit to guide your own\nsteps, and will not take counsel from those who are able to put you\nin the right way!\"\n\n\"How shall I be ruined?\" said Miss Mackenzie, jumping up from her\nseat.\n\n\"How? Yes. Now you want to know. After having insulted me in return\nfor my kindness in coming to you, you ask me questions. If I tell you\nhow, no doubt you will insult me again.\"\n\n\"I haven't insulted you, Mrs Stumfold. And if you don't like to tell\nme, you needn't. I'm sure I did not want you to come to me and talk\nin this way.\"\n\n\"Want me! Who ever does want to be reproved for their own folly? I\nsuppose what you want is to go on and marry that man, who may have\ntwo or three other wives for what you know, and put yourself and your\nmoney into the hands of a person whom you never saw in your life\nabove a few months ago, and of whose former life you literally know\nnothing. Tell the truth, Miss Mackenzie, isn't that what you desire\nto do?\"\n\n\"I find him acting as Mr Stumfold's curate.\"\n\n\"Yes; and when I come to warn you, you insult me. He is Mr Stumfold's\ncurate, and in many respects he is well fitted for his office.\"\n\n\"But has he two or three wives already, Mrs Stumfold?\"\n\n\"I never said that he had.\"\n\n\"I thought you hinted it.\"\n\n\"I never hinted it, Miss Mackenzie. If you would only be a little\nmore careful in the things which you allow yourself to say, it would\nbe better for yourself; and better for me too, while I am with you.\"\n\n\"I declare you said something about two or three wives; and if there\nis anything of that kind true of a gentleman and a clergyman, I don't\nthink he ought to be allowed to go about as a single gentleman. I\nmean as a curate. Mr Maguire is nothing to me,--nothing whatever; and\nI don't see why I should have been mixed up with him; but if there is\nanything of that sort--\"\n\n\"But there isn't.\"\n\n\"Then, Mrs Stumfold, I don't think you ought to have mentioned two\nor three wives. I don't, indeed. It is such a horrid idea,--quite\nhorrid! And I suppose, after all, the poor man has not got one?\"\n\n\"If you had allowed me, I should have told you all, Miss Mackenzie.\nMr Maguire is not married, and never has been married, as far as I\nknow.\"\n\n\"Then I do think what you said of him was very cruel.\"\n\n\"I said nothing; as you would have known, only you are so hot. Miss\nMackenzie, you quite astonish me; you do, indeed. I had expected to\nfind you temperate and calm; instead of that, you are so impetuous,\nthat you will not listen to a word. When it first came to my ears\nthat there might be something between you and Mr Maguire--\"\n\n\"I will not be told about something. What does something mean, Mrs\nStumfold?\"\n\n\"When I was told of this,\" continued Mrs Stumfold, determined that\nshe would not be stopped any longer by Miss Mackenzie's energy; \"when\nI was told of this, and, indeed, I may say saw it--\"\n\n\"You never saw anything, Mrs Stumfold.\"\n\n\"I immediately perceived that it was my duty to come to you; to come\nto you and tell you that another lady has a prior claim upon Mr\nMaguire's hand and heart.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed.\"\n\n\"Another young lady,\"--with an emphasis on the word young,--\"whom he\nfirst met at my house, who was introduced to him by me,--a young lady\nnot above thirty years of age, and quite suitable in every way to be\nMr Maguire's wife. She may not have quite so much money as you; but\nshe has a fair provision, and money is not everything; a lady in\nevery way suitable--\"\n\n\"But is this suitable young lady, who is only thirty years of age,\nengaged to him?\"\n\n\"I presume, Miss Mackenzie, that in speaking to you, I am speaking to\na lady who would not wish to interfere with another lady who has been\nbefore her. I do hope that you cannot be indifferent to the ordinary\nfeelings of a female Christian on that subject. What would you think\nif you were interfered with, though, perhaps, as you had not your\nfortune in early life, you may never have known what that was.\"\n\nThis was too much even for Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"Mrs Stumfold,\" she said, again rising from her seat, \"I won't talk\nabout this any more with you. Mr Maguire is nothing to me; and, as\nfar as I can see, if he was, that would be nothing to you.\"\n\n\"But it would,--a great deal.\"\n\n\"No, it wouldn't. You may say what you like to him, though, for the\nmatter of that, I think it a very indelicate thing for a lady to go\nabout raising such questions at all. But perhaps you have known him a\nlong time, and I have nothing to do with what you and he choose to\ntalk about. If he is behaving bad to any friend of yours, go and tell\nhim so. As for me, I won't hear anything more about it.\"\n\nAs Miss Mackenzie continued to stand, Mrs Stumfold was forced to\nstand also, and soon afterwards found herself compelled to go away.\nShe had, indeed, said all that she had come to say, and though she\nwould willingly have repeated it again had Miss Mackenzie been\nsubmissive, she did not find herself encouraged to do so by the\nrebellious nature of the lady she was visiting.\n\n\"I have meant well, Miss Mackenzie,\" she said as she took her\nleave, \"and I hope that I shall see you just the same as ever on my\nThursdays.\"\n\nTo this Miss Mackenzie made answer only by a curtsey, and then Mrs\nStumfold went her way.\n\nMiss Mackenzie, as soon as she was left to herself, began to cry.\nIf Mrs Stumfold could have seen her, how it would have soothed and\nrejoiced that lady's ruffled spirit! Miss Mackenzie would sooner have\ndied than have wept in Mrs Stumfold's presence, but no sooner was the\nfront door closed than she began. To have been attacked at all in\nthat way would have been too much for her, but to have been called\nold and unsuitable--for that was, in truth, the case; to hear herself\naccused of being courted solely for her money, and that when in truth\nshe had not been courted at all; to have been informed that a lover\nfor her must have been impossible in those days when she had no\nmoney! was not all this enough to make her cry? And then, was it the\ntruth that Mr Maguire ought to marry some one else? If so, she was\nthe last woman in Littlebath to interfere between him and that other\none. But how was she to know that this was not some villainy on the\npart of Mrs Stumfold? She felt sure, after what she had now seen and\nheard, that nothing in that way would be too bad for Mrs Stumfold to\nsay or do. She never would go to Mrs Stumfold's house again; that\nwas a matter of course; but what should she do about Mr Maguire? Mr\nMaguire might never speak to her in the way of affection,--probably\nnever would do so; that she could bear; but how was she to bear the\nfact that every Stumfoldian in Littlebath would know all about it?\nOn one thing she finally resolved, that if ever Mr Maguire spoke to\nher on the subject, she would tell him everything that had occurred.\nAfter that she cried herself to sleep.\n\nOn that afternoon she felt herself to be very desolate and much in\nwant of a friend. When Susanna came back from school in the evening\nshe was almost more desolate than before. She could say nothing of\nher troubles to one so young, nor yet could she shake off the thought\nof them. She had been bold enough while Mrs Stumfold had been with\nher, but now that she was alone, or almost worse than alone, having\nSusanna with her,--now that the reaction had come, she began to tell\nherself that a continuation of this solitary life would be impossible\nto her. How was she to live if she was to be trampled upon in this\nway? Was it not almost necessary that she should leave Littlebath?\nAnd yet if she were to leave Littlebath, whither should she go, and\nhow should she muster courage to begin everything over again? If only\nit had been given her to have one friend,--one female friend to whom\nshe could have told everything! She thought of Miss Baker, but Miss\nBaker was a staunch Stumfoldian; and what did she know of Miss Baker\nthat gave her any right to trouble Miss Baker on such a subject? She\nwould almost rather have gone to Miss Todd, if she had dared.\n\nShe laid awake crying half the night. Nothing of the kind had\never occurred to her before. No one had ever accused her of any\nimpropriety; no one had ever thrown it in her teeth that she was\nlonging after fruit that ought to be forbidden to her. In her former\nobscurity and dependence she had been safe. Now that she had begun\nto look about her and hope for joy in the world, she had fallen into\nthis terrible misfortune! Would it not have been better for her to\nhave married her cousin John Ball, and thus have had a clear course\nof duty marked out for her? Would it not have been better for her\neven to have married Harry Handcock than to have come to this misery?\nWhat good would her money do her, if the world was to treat her in\nthis way?\n\nAnd then, was it true? Was it the fact that Mr Maguire was\nill-treating some other woman in order that he might get her money?\nIn all her misery she remembered that Mrs Stumfold would not commit\nherself to any such direct assertion, and she remembered also\nthat Mrs Stumfold had especially insisted on her own part of the\ngrievance,--on the fact that the suitable young lady had been met by\nMr Maguire in her drawing-room. As to Mr Maguire himself, she could\nreconcile herself to the loss of him. Indeed she had never yet\nreconciled herself to the idea of taking him. But she could not\nendure to think that Mrs Stumfold's interference should prevail, or,\nworse still, that other people should have supposed it to prevail.\n\nThe next day was Thursday,--one of Mrs Stumfold's Thursdays,--and in\nthe course of the morning Miss Baker came to her, supposing that, as\na matter of course, she would go to the meeting.\n\n\"Not to-night, Miss Baker,\" said she.\n\n\"Not going! and why not?\"\n\n\"I'd rather not go out to-night.\"\n\n\"Dear me, how odd. I thought you always went to Mrs Stumfold's.\nThere's nothing wrong, I hope?\"\n\nThen Miss Mackenzie could not restrain herself, and told Miss Baker\neverything. And she told her story, not with whines and lamentations,\nas she had thought of it herself while lying awake during the past\nnight, but with spirited indignation. \"What right had she to come to\nme and accuse me?\"\n\n\"I suppose she meant it for the best,\" said Miss Baker.\n\n\"No, Miss Baker, she meant it for the worst. I am sorry to speak\nso of your friend, but I must speak as I find her. She intended to\ninsult me. Why did she tell me of my age and my money? Have I made\nmyself out to be young? or misbehaved myself with the means which\nProvidence has given me? And as to the gentleman, have I ever\nconducted myself so as to merit reproach? I don't know that I was\never ten minutes in his company that you were not there also.\"\n\n\"It was the last accusation I should have brought against you,\"\nwhimpered Miss Baker.\n\n\"Then why has she treated me in this way? What right have I given her\nto be my advisor, because I go to her husband's church? Mr Maguire\nis my friend, and it might have come to that, that he should be my\nhusband. Is there any sin in that, that I should be rebuked?\"\n\n\"It was for the other lady's sake, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Then let her go to the other lady, or to him. She has forgotten\nherself in coming to me, and she shall know that I think so.\"\n\nMiss Baker, when she left the Paragon, felt for Miss Mackenzie more\nof respect and more of esteem also than she had ever felt before. But\nMiss Mackenzie, when she was left alone, went upstairs, threw herself\non her bed, and was again dissolved in tears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nMr Maguire's Courtship\n\n\nAfter the scene between Miss Mackenzie and Miss Baker more than\na week passed by before Miss Mackenzie saw any of her Littlebath\nfriends; or, as she called them with much sadness when speaking of\nthem to herself, her Littlebath acquaintances. Friends, or friend,\nshe had none. It was a slow, heavy week with her, and it is hardly\ntoo much to say that every hour in it was spent in thinking of the\nattack which Mrs Stumfold had made upon her. When the first Sunday\ncame, she went to church, and saw there Miss Baker, and Mrs Stumfold,\nand Mr Stumfold and Mr Maguire. She saw, indeed, many Stumfoldians,\nbut it seemed that their eyes looked at her harshly, and she was\nquite sure that the coachmaker's wife treated her with marked\nincivility as they left the porch together. Miss Baker had frequently\nwaited for her on Sunday mornings, and walked the length of two\nstreets with her; but she encountered no Miss Baker near the church\ngate on this morning, and she was sure that Mrs Stumfold had\nprevailed against her. If it was to be thus with her, had she not\nbetter leave Littlebath as soon as possible? In the same solitude she\nlived the whole of the next week; with the same feelings did she go\nto church on the next Sunday; and then again was she maltreated by\nthe upturned nose and half-averted eyes of the coachmaker's wife.\n\nLife such as this would be impossible to her. Let any of my readers\nthink of it, and then tell themselves whether it could be possible.\nMariana's solitude in the moated grange was as nothing to hers. In\ngranges, and such like rural retreats, people expect solitude; but\nMiss Mackenzie had gone to Littlebath to find companionship. Had she\nbeen utterly disappointed, and found none, that would have been bad;\nbut she had found it and then lost it. Mariana, in her desolateness,\nwas still waiting for the coming of some one; and so was Miss\nMackenzie waiting, though she hardly knew for whom. For me, if I am\nto live in a moated grange, let it be in the country. Moated granges\nin the midst of populous towns are very terrible.\n\nBut on the Monday morning,--the morning of the second Monday after\nthe Stumfoldian attack,--Mr Maguire came, and Mariana's weariness\nwas, for the time, at an end. Susanna had hardly gone, and the\nbreakfast things were still on the table, when the maid brought her\nup word that Mr Maguire was below, and would see her if she would\nallow him to come up. She had heard no ring at the bell, and having\nsettled herself with a novel in the arm-chair, had almost ceased\nfor the moment to think of Mr Maguire or of Mrs Stumfold. There was\nsomething so sudden in the request now made to her, that it took away\nher breath.\n\n\"Mr Maguire, Miss, the clergyman from Mr Stumfold's church,\" said the\ngirl again.\n\nIt was necessary that she should give an answer, though she was ever\nso breathless.\n\n\"Ask Mr Maguire to walk up,\" she said; and then she began to bethink\nherself how she would behave to him.\n\nHe was there, however, before her thoughts were of much service to\nher, and she began by apologising for the breakfast things.\n\n\"It is I that ought to beg your pardon for coming so early,\" said he;\n\"but my time at present is so occupied that I hardly know how to find\nhalf an hour for myself; and I thought you would excuse me.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said she; and then sitting down she waited for him\nto begin.\n\nIt would have been clear to any observer, had there been one present,\nthat Mr Maguire had practised his lesson. He could not rid himself\nof those unmistakable signs of preparation which every speaker shows\nwhen he has been guilty of them. But this probably did not matter\nwith Miss Mackenzie, who was too intent on the part she herself had\nto play to notice his imperfections.\n\n\"I saw that you observed, Miss Mackenzie,\" he said, \"that I kept\naloof from you on the two last evenings on which I met you at Mrs\nStumfold's.\"\n\n\"That's a long time ago, Mr Maguire,\" she answered. \"It's nearly a\nmonth since I went to Mrs Stumfold's house.\"\n\n\"I know that you were not there on the last Thursday. I noticed it.\nI could not fail to notice it. Thinking so much of you as I do, of\ncourse I did notice it. Might I ask you why you did not go?\"\n\n\"I'd rather not say anything about it,\" she replied, after a pause.\n\n\"Then there has been some reason? Dear Miss Mackenzie, I can assure\nyou I do not ask you without a cause.\"\n\n\"If you please, I will not speak upon that subject. I had much rather\nnot, indeed, Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"And shall I not have the pleasure of seeing you there on next\nThursday?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Then you have quarrelled with her, Miss Mackenzie?\"\n\nHe said nothing now of the perfections of that excellent woman, of\nwhom not long since he had spoken in terms almost too strong for any\nsimple human virtues.\n\n\"I'd rather not speak of it. It can't do any good. I don't know why\nyou should ask me whether I intend to go there any more, but as you\nhave, I have answered you.\"\n\nThen Mr Maguire got up from his chair, and walked about the room,\nand Miss Mackenzie, watching him closely, could see that he was\nmuch moved. But, nevertheless, I think he had made up his mind to\nwalk about the room beforehand. After a while he paused, and, still\nstanding, spoke to her again across the table.\n\n\"May I ask you this question? Has Mrs Stumfold said anything to you\nabout me?\"\n\n\"I'd rather not talk about Mrs Stumfold.\"\n\n\"But, surely, I may ask that. I don't think you are the woman to\nallow anything said behind a person's back to be received to his\ndetriment.\"\n\n\"Whatever one does hear about people one always hears behind their\nbacks.\"\n\n\"Then she has told you something, and you have believed it?\"\n\nShe felt herself to be so driven by him that she did not know how\nto protect herself. It seemed to her that these clerical people of\nLittlebath had very little regard for the feelings of others in their\nmodes of following their own pursuits.\n\n\"She has told you something of me, and you have believed her?\"\nrepeated Mr Maguire. \"Have I not a right to ask you what she has\nsaid?\"\n\n\"You have no right to ask me anything.\"\n\n\"Have I not, Miss Mackenzie? Surely that is hard. Is it not hard that\nI should be stabbed in the dark, and have no means of redressing\nmyself? I did not expect such an answer from you;--indeed I did not.\"\n\n\"And is not it hard that I should be troubled in this way? You talk\nof stabbing. Who has stabbed you? Is it not your own particular\nfriend, whom you described to me as the best person in all the world?\nIf you and she fall out why should I be brought into it? Once for\nall, Mr Maguire, I won't be brought into it.\"\n\nNow he sat down and again paused before he went on with his talk.\n\n\"Miss Mackenzie,\" he said, when he did speak. \"I had not intended to\nbe so abrupt as I fear you will think me in that which I am about to\nsay; but I believe you will like plain measures best.\"\n\n\"Certainly I shall, Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"They are the best, always. If, then, I am plain with you, will you\nbe plain with me also? I think you must guess what it is I have to\nsay to you.\"\n\n\"I hate guessing anything, Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"Very well; then I will be plain. We have now known each other for\nnearly a year, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"A year, is it? No, not a year. This is the beginning of June, and\nI did not come here till the end of last August. It's about nine\nmonths, Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"Very well; nine months. Nine months may be as nothing in an\nacquaintance, or it may lead to the closest friendship.\"\n\n\"I don't know that we have met so very often. You have the parish to\nattend to, Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"Of course I have--or rather I had, for I have left Mr Stumfold.\"\n\n\"Left Mr Stumfold! Why, I heard you preach yesterday.\"\n\n\"I did preach yesterday, and shall till he has got another assistant.\nBut he and I are parted as regards all friendly connection.\"\n\n\"But isn't that a pity?\"\n\n\"Miss Mackenzie, I don't mind telling you that I have found it\nimpossible to put up with the impertinence of that woman\"--and\nnow, as he spoke, there came a distorted fire out of his imperfect\neye--\"impossible! If you knew what I have gone through in attempting\nit! But that's over. I have the greatest respect for him in the\nworld; a very thorough esteem. He is a hard-working man, and though\nI do not always approve the style of his wit,--of which, by-the-bye,\nhe thinks too much himself,--still I acknowledge him to be a good\nspiritual pastor. But he has been unfortunate in his marriage. No\ndoubt he has got money, but money is not everything.\"\n\n\"Indeed, it is not, Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"How he can live in the same house with that Mr Peters, I can\nnever understand. The quarrels between him and his daughter are so\nincessant that poor Mr Stumfold is unable to conceal them from the\npublic.\"\n\n\"But you have spoken so highly of her.\"\n\n\"I have endeavoured, Miss Mackenzie--I have endeavoured to think well\nof her. I have striven to believe that it was all gold that I saw.\nBut let that pass. I was forced to tell you that I am going to leave\nMr Stumfold's church, or I should not now have spoken about her or\nhim. And now comes the question, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"What is the question, Mr Maguire?\"\n\n\"Miss Mackenzie--Margaret, will you share your lot with mine? It is\ntrue that you have money. It is true that I have none,--not even a\ncuracy now. But I don't think that any such consideration as that\nwould weigh with you for a moment, if you can find it in your heart\nto love me.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie sat thinking for some minutes before she gave her\nanswer--or striving to think; but she was so completely under the\nterrible fire of his eye, that any thought was very difficult.\n\n\"I am not quite sure about that,\" she said after a while. \"I think,\nMr Maguire, that there should be a little money on both sides. You\nwould hardly wish to live altogether on your wife's fortune.\"\n\n\"I have my profession,\" he replied, quickly.\n\n\"Yes, certainly; and a noble profession it is,--the most noble,\" said\nshe.\n\n\"Yes, indeed; the most noble.\"\n\n\"But somehow--\"\n\n\"You mean the clergymen are not paid as they should be. No, they are\nnot, Miss Mackenzie. And is it not a shame for a Christian country\nlike this that it should be so? But still, as a profession, it has\nits value. Look at Mrs Stumfold; where would she be if she were not a\nclergyman's wife? The position has its value. A clergyman's wife is\nreceived everywhere, you know.\"\n\n\"A man before he talks of marriage ought to have something of his\nown, Mr Maguire, besides--\"\n\n\"Besides what?\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you. As you have done me this honour, I think that\nI am now bound to tell you what Mrs Stumfold said to me. She had\nno right to connect my name with yours or with that of any other\ngentleman, and my quarrel with her is about that. As to what she said\nabout you, that is your affair and not mine.\"\n\nThen she told him the whole of that conversation which was given in\nthe last chapter, not indeed repeating the hint about the three or\nfour wives, but recapitulating as clearly as she could all that had\nbeen said about the suitable young lady.\n\n\"I knew it,\" said he; \"I knew it. I knew it as well as though I had\nheard it. Now what am I to think of that woman, Miss Mackenzie?\"\n\n\"Of which woman?\"\n\n\"Of Mrs Stumfold, of course. It's all jealousy: every bit of it\njealousy.\"\n\n\"Jealousy! Do you mean that she--that she--\"\n\n\"Not jealousy of that kind, Miss Mackenzie. Oh dear, no. She's as\npure as the undriven snow, I should say, as far as that goes. But she\ncan't bear to think that I should rise in the world.\"\n\n\"I thought she wanted to marry you to a suitable lady, and young,\nwith a fair provision.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! The lady has about seventy pounds a-year! But that would\nsignify nothing if I loved her, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"There has been something, then?\"\n\n\"Yes; there has been something. That is, nothing of my\ndoing,--nothing on earth. Miss Mackenzie, I am as innocent as the\nbabe unborn.\"\n\nAs he said this she could not help looking into the horrors of his\neyes, and thinking that innocent was not the word for him.\n\n\"I'm as innocent as the babe unborn. Why should I be expected to\nmarry a lady merely because Mrs Stumfold tells me that there she is?\nAnd it's my belief that old Peters has got their money somewhere, and\nwon't give it up, and that that's the reason of it.\"\n\n\"But did you ever say you would marry her?\"\n\n\"What! Miss Floss, never! I'll tell you the whole story, Miss\nMackenzie; and if you want to ask any one else, you can ask Mrs\nPerch.\" Mrs Perch was the coachbuilder's wife. \"You've seen Miss\nFloss at Mrs Stumfold's, and must know yourself whether I ever\nnoticed her any more than to be decently civil.\"\n\n\"Is she the lady that's so thin and tall?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"With the red hair?\"\n\n\"Well, it's sandy, certainly. I shouldn't call it just red myself.\"\n\n\"Some people like red hair, you know,\" said Miss Mackenzie, thinking\nof the suitable lady. Miss Mackenzie was willing at that moment to\nforfeit all her fortune if Miss Floss was not older than she was!\n\"And that is Miss Floss, is it?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I don't blame Mrs Stumfold for wishing to get a husband for\nher friend, but it is hard upon me.\"\n\n\"Really, Mr Maguire, I think that perhaps you couldn't do better.\"\n\n\"Better than what?\"\n\n\"Better than take Miss Floss. As you say, some people like red hair.\nAnd she is very suitable, certainly. And, Mr Maguire, I really\nshouldn't like to interfere;--I shouldn't indeed.\"\n\n\"Miss Mackenzie, you're joking, I know.\"\n\n\"Not in the least, Mr Maguire. You see there has been something about\nit.\"\n\n\"There has been nothing.\"\n\n\"There's never smoke without fire; and I don't think a lady like Mrs\nStumfold would come here and tell me all that she did, if it hadn't\ngone some way. And you owned just now that you admired her.\"\n\n\"I never owned anything of the kind. I don't admire her a bit. Admire\nher! Oh, Miss Mackenzie, what do you think of me?\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie said that she really didn't know what to think.\n\nThen, having as he thought altogether disposed of Miss Floss, he\nbegan again to press his suit. And she was weak; for though she gave\nhim no positive encouragement, neither did she give him any positive\ndenial. Her mind was by no means made up, and she did not know\nwhether she wished to take him or to leave him. Now that the thing\nhad come so near, what guarantee had she that he would be good to\nher if she gave him everything that she possessed? As to her cousin\nJohn Ball, she would have had many guarantees. Of him she could say\nthat she knew what sort of a man he was; but what did she know of\nMr Maguire? At that moment, as he sat there pleading his own cause\nwith all the eloquence at his command, she remembered that she did\nnot even know his Christian name. He had always in her presence been\ncalled Mr Maguire. How could she say that she loved a man whose very\nname she had not as yet heard?\n\nBut still, if she left all her chances to run from her, what other\nfate would she have but that of being friendless all her life? Of\ncourse she must risk much if she was ever minded to change her mode\nof life. She had said something to him as to the expediency of there\nbeing money on both sides, but as she said it she knew that she would\nwillingly have given up her money could she only have been sure of\nher man. Was not her income enough for both? What she wanted was\ncompanionship, and love if it might be possible; but if not love,\nthen friendship. This, had she known where she could purchase it with\ncertainty, she would willingly have purchased with all her wealth.\n\n\"If I have surprised you, will you say that you will take time to\nthink of it?\" pleaded Mr Maguire.\n\nMiss Mackenzie, speaking in the lowest possible voice, said that she\nwould take time to think of it.\n\nWhen a lady says that she will take time to think of such a\nproposition, the gentleman is generally justified in supposing that\nhe has carried his cause. When a lady rejects a suitor, she should\nreject him peremptorily. Anything short of such peremptory reaction\nis taken for acquiescence. Mr Maguire consequently was elated, called\nher Margaret, and swore that he loved her as he had never loved woman\nyet.\n\n\"And when may I come again?\" he asked.\n\nMiss Mackenzie begged that she might be allowed a fortnight to think\nof it.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the happy man.\n\n\"And you must not be surprised,\" said Miss Mackenzie, \"if I make some\ninquiry about Miss Floss.\"\n\n\"Any inquiry you please,\" said Mr Maguire. \"It is all in that woman's\nbrain; it is indeed. Miss Floss, perhaps, has thought of it; but I\ncan't help that, can I? I can't help what has been said to her. But\nif you mean anything as to a promise from me, Margaret, on my word\nas a Christian minister of the Gospel, there has been nothing of the\nkind.\"\n\nShe did not much mind his calling her Margaret; it was in itself such\na trifle; but when he made a fuss about kissing her hand it annoyed\nher.\n\n\"Only your hand,\" he said, beseeching the privilege.\n\n\"Pshaw,\" she said, \"what's the good?\"\n\nShe had sense enough to feel that with such lovemaking as that\nbetween her and her lover there should be no kissing till after\nmarriage; or at any rate, no kissing of hands, as is done between\nhandsome young men of twenty-three and beautiful young ladies of\neighteen, when they sit in balconies on moonlight nights. A good\nhonest kiss, mouth to mouth, might not be amiss when matters were\naltogether settled; but when she thought of this, she thought also of\nhis eye and shuddered. His eye was not his fault, and a man should\nnot be left all his days without a wife because he squints; but\nstill, was it possible? could she bring herself to endure it?\n\nHe did kiss her hand, however, and then went. As he stood at the door\nhe looked back fondly and exclaimed--\n\n\"On Monday fortnight, Margaret; on Monday fortnight.\"\n\n\"Goodness gracious, Mr Maguire,\" she answered, \"do shut the door;\"\nand then he vanished.\n\nAs soon as he was gone she remembered that his name was Jeremiah. She\ndid not know how she had learned it, but she knew that such was the\nfact. If it did come to pass how was she to call him? She tried the\nentire word Jeremiah, but it did not seem to answer. She tried Jerry\nalso, but that was worse. Jerry might have been very well had they\ncome together fifteen years earlier in life, but she did not think\nthat she could call him Jerry now. She supposed it must be Mr\nMaguire; but if so, half the romance of the thing would be gone at\nonce!\n\nShe felt herself to be very much at sea, and almost wished that she\nmight be like Mariana again, waiting and aweary, so grievous was\nthe necessity of having to make up her mind on such a subject. To\nwhom should she go for advice? She had told him that she would make\nfurther inquiries about Miss Floss, but of whom was she to make them?\nThe only person to whom she could apply was Miss Baker, and she\nwas almost sure that Miss Baker would despise her for thinking of\nmarrying Mr Maguire.\n\nBut after a day or two she did tell Miss Baker, and she saw at\nonce that Miss Baker did despise her. But Miss Baker, though she\nmanifestly did despise her, promised her some little aid. Miss Todd\nknew everything and everybody. Might Miss Baker tell Miss Todd?\nIf there was anything wrong, Miss Todd would ferret it out to a\ncertainty. Miss Mackenzie, hanging down her head, said that Miss\nBaker might tell Miss Todd. Miss Baker, when she left Miss Mackenzie,\nturned at once into Miss Todd's house, and found her friend at home.\n\n\"It surprises me that any woman should be so foolish,\" said Miss\nBaker.\n\n\"Come, come, my dear, don't you be hard upon her. We have all been\nfoolish in our days. Do you remember, when Sir Lionel used to be\nhere, how foolish you and I were?\"\n\n\"It's not the same thing at all,\" said Miss Baker. \"Did you ever see\na man with such an eye as he has got?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't mind his eye, my dear; only I'm afraid he's got no\nmoney.\"\n\nMiss Todd, however, promised to make inquiries, and declared her\nintention of communicating what intelligence she might obtain direct\nto Miss Mackenzie. Miss Baker resisted this for a little while,\nbut ultimately submitted, as she was wont to do, to the stronger\ncharacter of her friend.\n\nMiss Mackenzie had declared that she must have a fortnight to\nthink about it, and Miss Todd therefore knew that she had nearly a\nfortnight for her inquiries. The reader may be sure that she did not\nallow the grass to grow under her feet. With Miss Mackenzie the time\npassed slowly enough, for she could only sit on her sofa and doubt,\nresolving first one way and then another; but Miss Todd went about\nLittlebath, here and there, among friends and enemies, filling up all\nher time; and before the end of the fortnight she certainly knew more\nabout Mr Maguire than did anybody else in Littlebath.\n\nShe did not see Miss Mackenzie till the Saturday, the last Saturday\nbefore the all-important Monday; but on that day she went to her.\n\n\"I suppose you know what I'm come about, my dear,\" she said.\n\nMiss Mackenzie blushed, and muttered something about Miss Baker.\n\n\"Yes, my dear; Miss Baker was speaking to me about Mr Maguire. You\nneedn't mind speaking out to me, Miss Mackenzie. I can understand all\nabout it; and if I can be of any assistance, I shall be very happy.\nNo doubt you feel a little shy, but you needn't mind with me.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you're very good.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, but I hope I'm not very bad. The long and\nthe short of it is, I suppose, that you think you might as\nwell--might as well take Mr Maguire.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie felt thoroughly ashamed of herself. She could not\nexplain to Miss Todd all her best motives; and then, those motives\nwhich were not the best were made to seem so very weak and mean by\nthe way in which Miss Todd approached them. When she thought of the\nmatter alone, it seemed to her that she was perfectly reasonable in\nwishing to be married, in order that she might escape the monotony of\na lonely life; and she thought that if she could talk to Miss Todd\nabout the subject gently, for a quarter of an hour at a time every\nday for two or three months, it was possible that she might explain\nher views with credit to herself; but how could she do this to anyone\nso very abruptly? She could only confess that she did want to marry\nthe man, as the child confesses her longing for a tart.\n\n\"I have thought about it, certainly,\" she said.\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Miss Todd; \"quite right if you like him. Now for\nme, I'm so fond of my own money and my own independence, that I've\nnever had a fancy that way,--not since I was a girl.\"\n\n\"But you're so different, Miss Todd; you've got such a position of\nyour own.\"\n\nAnd Miss Mackenzie, who was at present desirous of marrying a very\nstrict evangelical clergyman, thought with envy of the social\nadvantages and pleasant iniquities of her wicked neighbour.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. I've a few friends, but that comes of being here\nso long. And then, you see, I ain't particular as you are. I always\nsee that when a lady goes in to be evangelical, she soon finds a\nhusband to take care of her; that is, if she has got any money. It\nall goes on very well, and I've no doubt they're right. There's my\nfriend Mary Baker, she's single still; but then she began very late\nin life. Now about Mr Maguire.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Todd.\"\n\n\"In the first place, I really don't think he has got much that he can\ncall his own.\"\n\n\"He hasn't got anything, Miss Todd; he told me so himself.\"\n\n\"Did he, indeed?\" said Miss Todd; \"then let me tell you he is a deal\nhonester than they are in general.\"\n\n\"Oh, he told me that. I know he's got no income in the world besides\nhis curacy, and that he has thrown up.\"\n\n\"And therefore you are going to give him yours.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, Miss Todd; but it wasn't about money that\nI was doubting. What I've got is enough for both of us, if his wants\nare not greater than mine. What is the use of money if people cannot\nbe happy together with it? I don't care a bit for money, Miss Todd;\nthat is, not for itself. I shouldn't like to be dependent on a\nstranger; I don't know that I would like to be dependent again even\non a brother; but I should take no shame to be dependent on a husband\nif he was good to me.\"\n\n\"That's just it; isn't it?\"\n\n\"There's quite enough for him and me.\"\n\n\"I must say you look at the matter in the most disinterested way. I\ncouldn't bring myself to take it up like that.\"\n\n\"You haven't lived the life that I have, Miss Todd, and I don't\nsuppose you ever feel solitary as I do.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know. We single women have to be solitary\nsometimes--and sometimes sad.\"\n\n\"But you're never sad, Miss Todd.\"\n\n\"Have you never heard there are some animals, that, when they're\nsick, crawl into holes, and don't ever show themselves among the\nother animals? Though it is only the animals that do it, there's a\npride in that which I like. What's the good of complaining if one's\ndown in the mouth? When one gets old and heavy and stupid, one can't\ngo about as one did when one was young; and other people won't care\nto come to you as they did then.\"\n\n\"But I had none of that when I was young, Miss Todd.\"\n\n\"Hadn't you? Then I won't say but what you may be right to try and\nbegin now. But, law! what am I talking of? I am old enough to be your\nmother.\"\n\n\"I think it so kind of you to talk to me at all.\"\n\n\"Well, now about Mr Maguire. I don't think he's possessed of much of\nthe fat of the land; but that you say you know already?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I know all that.\"\n\n\"And it seems he has lost his curacy?\"\n\n\"He threw that up himself.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be surprised--but mind I don't say this for certain--but\nI shouldn't be surprised if he owed a little money.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie's face became rather long.\n\n\"What do you call a little, Miss Todd?\"\n\n\"Two or three hundred pounds. I don't call that a great deal.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no!\" and Miss Mackenzie's face again became cheerful. \"That\ncould be settled without any trouble.\"\n\n\"Upon my word you are the most generous woman I ever saw.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not that.\"\n\n\"Or else you must be very much in love?\"\n\n\"I don't think I am that either, Miss Todd; only I don't care much\nabout money if other things are suitable. What I chiefly wanted to\nknow was--\"\n\n\"About that Miss Floss?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Todd.\"\n\n\"My belief is there never was a greater calumny, or what I should\ncall a stronger attempt at a do. Mind I don't think much of your St\nStumfolda, and never did. I believe the poor man has never said a\nword to the woman. Mrs Stumfold has put it into her head that she\ncould have Mr Maguire if she chose to set her cap at him, and, I dare\nsay, Miss Floss has been dutiful to her saint. But, Miss Mackenzie,\nif nothing else hinders you, don't let that hinder you.\" Then Miss\nTodd, having done her business and made her report, took her leave.\n\nThis was on Saturday. The next day would be Sunday, and then on the\nfollowing morning she must make her answer. All that she had heard\nabout Mr Maguire was, to her thinking, in his favour. As to his\npoverty, that he had declared himself, and that she did not mind. As\nto a few hundred pounds of debt, how was a poor man to have helped\nsuch a misfortune? In that matter of Miss Floss he had been basely\nmaligned,--so much maligned, that Miss Mackenzie owed him all her\nsympathy. What excuse could she now have for refusing him?\n\nWhen she went to bed on the Sunday night such were her thoughts and\nher feelings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTom Mackenzie's Bed-Side\n\n\nThere was a Stumfoldian edict, ultra-Median-and-Persian in its\nstrictness, ordaining that no Stumfoldian in Littlebath should be\nallowed to receive a letter on Sundays. And there also existed a\ncoordinate rule on the part of the Postmaster-General,--or, rather,\na privilege granted by that functionary,--in accordance with which\nStumfoldians, and other such sects of Sabbatarians, were empowered\nto prohibit the letter-carriers from contaminating their special\nknockers on Sunday mornings. Miss Mackenzie had given way to this\neasily, seeing nothing amiss in the edict, and not caring much for\nher Sunday letters. In consequence, she received on the Monday\nmornings those letters which were due to her on Sundays, and on this\nspecial Monday morning she received a letter, as to which the delay\nwas of much consequence. It was to tell her that her brother Tom was\ndying, and to pray that she would be up in London as early on the\nMonday as was practicable. Mr Samuel Rubb, junior, who had written\nthe letter in Gower Street, had known nothing of the Sabbatical\nedicts of the Stumfoldians.\n\n\"It is an inward tumour,\" said Mr Rubb, \"and has troubled him long,\nthough he has said nothing about it. It is now breaking, and the\ndoctor says he can't live. He begs that you will come to him, as he\nhas very much to say to you. Mrs Tom would have written, but she is\nso much taken up, and is so much beside herself, that she begs me to\nsay that she is not able; but I hope it won't be less welcome coming\nfrom me. The second pair back will be ready for you, just as if it\nwere your own. I would be waiting at the station on Monday, if I knew\nwhat train you would come by.\"\n\nThis she received while at breakfast on the Monday morning, having\nsat down a little earlier than usual, in order that the tea-things\nmight be taken away so as to make room for Mr Maguire.\n\nOf course she must go up to town instantly, by the first practicable\ntrain. She perceived at once that she would have to send a message by\ntelegraph, as they would have expected to hear from her that morning.\nShe got the railway guide, and saw that the early express train had\nalready gone. There was, however, a mid-day train which would reach\nPaddington in the afternoon. She immediately got her bonnet and went\noff to the telegraph office, leaving word with the servant, that\nif any one called \"he\" was to be told that she had received sudden\ntidings which took her up to London. On her return she found that\n\"he\" had not been there yet, and now she could only hope that he\nwould not come till after she had started. It would, of course, be\nimpossible, at such a moment as this, to make any answer to such a\nproposition as Mr Maguire's.\n\nHe came, and when the servant gave him the message at the door, he\nsent up craving permission to see her but for a moment. She could not\nrefuse him, and went down to him in the drawing-room, with her shawl\nand bonnet.\n\n\"Dearest Margaret,\" said he, \"what is this?\" and he took both her\nhands.\n\n\"I have received word that my brother, in London, is very ill,--that\nhe is dying, and I must go to him.\"\n\nHe still held her hands, standing close to her, as though he had some\nspecial right to comfort her.\n\n\"Cannot I go with you?\" he said. \"Let me; do let me.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Mr Maguire; it is impossible. What could you do? I am going\nto my brother's house.\"\n\n\"But have I not a right to be of help to you at such a time?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"No, Mr Maguire; no right; certainly none as yet.\"\n\n\"Oh! Margaret.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you will see that I cannot talk of anything of that sort\nnow.\"\n\n\"But you will not be back for ever so long.\"\n\n\"I cannot tell.\"\n\n\"Oh! Margaret; you will not leave me in suspense? After bidding me\nwait a fortnight, you will not go away without telling me that you\nwill be mine when you come back? One word will do it.\"\n\n\"Mr Maguire, you really must excuse me now.\"\n\n\"One word, Margaret; only one word,\" and he still held her.\n\n\"Mr Maguire,\" she said, tearing her hand from him, \"I am astonished\nat you. I tell you that my brother is dying and you hold me here, and\nexpect me to give you an answer about nonsense. I thought you were\nmore manly.\"\n\nHe saw that there was a flash in her eye as he stepped back; so he\nbegged her pardon, and muttering something about hoping to hear from\nher soon, took his leave. Poor man! I do not see why she should not\nhave accepted him, as she had made up her mind to do so. And to him,\nwith his creditors, and in his present position, any certainty in\nthis matter would have made so much difference!\n\nAt the Paddington station Miss Mackenzie was met by her other lover,\nMr Rubb. Mr Rubb, however, had never yet declared himself as holding\nthis position, and did not do so on the present occasion. Their\nconversation in the cab was wholly concerning her brother's state, or\nnearly so. It seemed that there was no hope. Mr Rubb said that very\nclearly. As to time the doctor would say nothing certain; but he had\ndeclared that it might occur any day. The patient could never leave\nhis bed again; but as his constitution was strong, he might remain in\nhis present condition some weeks. He did not suffer much pain, or, at\nany rate, did not complain of much; but was very sad. Then Mr Rubb\nsaid one other word.\n\n\"I am afraid he is thinking of his wife and children.\"\n\n\"Would there be nothing for them out of the business?\" asked Miss\nMackenzie.\n\nThe junior partner at first shook his head, saying nothing. After a\nfew minutes he did speak in a low voice. \"If there be anything, it\nwill be very little,--very little.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie was rejoiced that she had given no definite promise to\nMr Maguire. There seemed to be now a job for her to do in the world\nwhich would render it quite unnecessary that she should look about\nfor a husband. If her brother's widow were left penniless, with seven\nchildren, there would be no longer much question as to what she would\ndo with her money. Perhaps the only person in the world that she\ncordially disliked was her sister-in-law. She certainly knew no other\nwoman whose society would be so unpalatable to her. But if things\nwere so as Mr Rubb now described them, there could be no doubt about\nher duty. It was very well indeed that her answer to Mr Maguire had\nbeen postponed to that Monday.\n\nShe found her sister-in-law in the dining-room, and Mrs Mackenzie, of\ncourse, received her with a shower of tears. \"I did think you would\nhave come, Margaret, by the first train.\"\n\nThen Margaret was forced to explain all about the letter and the\nSunday arrangements at Littlebath; and Mrs Tom was stupid and\nwouldn't understand, but persisted in her grievance, declaring that\nTom was killing himself with disappointment.\n\n\"And there's Dr Slumpy just this moment gone without a word to\ncomfort one,--not even to say about when it will be. I suppose you'll\nwant your dinner before you go up to see him. As for us we've had no\ndinners, or anything regular; but, of course, you must be waited on.\"\nMiss Mackenzie simply took off her bonnet and shawl, and declared\nherself ready to go upstairs as soon as her brother would be ready to\nsee her.\n\n\"It's fret about money has done it all, Margaret,\" said the wife.\n\"Since the day that Walter's shocking will was read, he's never been\nhimself for an hour. Of course he wouldn't show it to you; but he\nnever has.\"\n\nMargaret turned short round upon her sister-in-law on the stairs.\n\n\"Sarah,\" said she, and then she stopped herself. \"Never mind; it is\nnatural, no doubt, you should feel it; but there are times and places\nwhen one's feelings should be kept under control.\"\n\n\"That's mighty fine,\" said Mrs Mackenzie; \"but, however, if you'll\nwait here, I'll go up to him.\"\n\nIn a few minutes more Miss Mackenzie was standing by her brother's\nbedside, holding his hand in hers.\n\n\"I knew you would come, Margaret,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course I should come; who doubted it? But never mind that, for\nhere I am.\"\n\n\"I only told her that we expected her by the earlier train,\" said Mrs\nTom.\n\n\"Never mind the train as long as she's here,\" said Tom. \"You've heard\nhow it is with me, Margaret?\"\n\nThen Margaret buried her face in the bed-clothes and wept, and Mrs\nTom, weeping also, hid herself behind the curtains.\n\nThere was nothing said then about money or the troubles of the\nbusiness, and after a while the two women went down to tea. In the\ndining-room they found Mr Rubb, who seemed to be quite at home in the\nhouse. Cold meat was brought up for Margaret's dinner, and they all\nsat down to one of those sad sick-house meals which he or she who has\nnot known must have been lucky indeed. To Margaret it was nothing\nnew. All the life that she remembered, except the last year, had been\nspent in nursing her other brother; and now to be employed about the\nbed-side of a sufferer was as natural to her as the air she breathed.\n\n\"I will sit with him to-night, Sarah, if you will let me,\" she said;\nand Sarah assented.\n\nIt was still daylight when she found herself at her post. Mrs\nMackenzie had just left the room to go down among the children,\nsaying that she would return again before she left him for the night.\nTo this the invalid remonstrated, begging his wife to go to bed.\n\n\"She has not had her clothes off for the last week,\" said the\nhusband.\n\n\"It don't matter about my clothes,\" said Mrs Tom, still weeping. She\nwas always crying when in the sick room, and always scolding when\nout of it; thus complying with the two different requisitions of her\nnature. The matter, however, was settled by an assurance on her part\nthat she would go to bed, so that she might be stirring early.\n\nThere are women who seem to have an absolute pleasure in fixing\nthemselves for business by the bedside of a sick man. They generally\ncommence their operations by laying aside all fictitious feminine\ncharms, and by arraying themselves with a rigid, unconventional,\nunenticing propriety. Though they are still gentle,--perhaps more\ngentle than ever in their movements,--there is a decision in all they\ndo very unlike their usual mode of action. The sick man, who is not\nso sick but what he can ponder on the matter, feels himself to be\nlike a baby, whom he has seen the nurse to take from its cradle, pat\non the back, feed, and then return to its little couch, all without\nundue violence or tyranny, but still with a certain consciousness of\nomnipotence as far as that child was concerned. The vitality of the\nman is gone from him, and he, in his prostrate condition, debarred\nby all the features of his condition from spontaneous exertion,\nfeels himself to be more a woman than the woman herself. She, if\nshe be such a one as our Miss Mackenzie, arranges her bottles with\nprecision; knows exactly how to place her chair, her lamp, and her\nteapot; settles her cap usefully on her head, and prepares for the\nnight's work certainly with satisfaction. And such are the best women\nof the world,--among which number I think that Miss Mackenzie has a\nright to be counted.\n\nA few words of affection were spoken between the brother and\nsister, for at such moments brotherly affection returns, and the\nestrangements of life are all forgotten in the old memories. He\nseemed comforted to feel her hand upon the bed, and was glad to\npronounce her name, and spoke to her as though she had been the\nfavourite of the family for years, instead of the one member of\nit who had been snubbed and disregarded. Poor man, who shall say\nthat there was anything hypocritical or false in this? And yet,\nundoubtedly, it was the fact that Margaret was now the only wealthy\none among them, which had made him send to her, and think of her, as\nhe lay there in his sickness.\n\nWhen these words of love had been spoken, he turned himself on his\npillow, and lay silent for a long while,--for hours, till the morning\nsun had risen, and the daylight was again seen through the window\ncurtain. It was not much after midsummer, and the daylight came to\nthem early. From time to time she had looked at him, and each hour\nin the night she had crept round to him, and given him that which he\nneeded. She did it all with a certain system, noiselessly, but with\nan absolute assurance on her own part that she carried with her an\nauthority sufficient to ensure obedience. On that ground, in that\nplace, I think that even Miss Todd would have succumbed to her.\n\nBut when the morning sun had driven the appearance of night from the\nroom, making the paraphernalia of sickness more ghastly than they had\nbeen under the light of the lamp, the brother turned himself back\nagain, and began to talk of those things which were weighing on his\nmind.\n\n\"Margaret,\" he said, \"it's very good of you to come, but as to\nmyself, no one's coming can be of any use to me.\"\n\n\"It is all in the hands of God, Tom.\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt,\" said he, sadly, not daring to argue such a\npoint with her, and yet feeling but little consolation from her\nassurance. \"So is the bullock in God's hands when the butcher is\ngoing to knock him on the head, but yet we know that the beast\nwill die. Men live and die from natural causes, and not by God's\ninterposition.\"\n\n\"But there is hope; that is what I mean. If God pleases--\"\n\n\"Ah, well. But, Margaret, I fear that he will not please; and what am\nI to do about Sarah and the children?\"\n\nThis was a question that could be answered by no general\nplatitude,--by no weak words of hopeless consolation. Coming from\nhim to her, it demanded either a very substantial answer, or else\nno answer at all. What was he to do about Sarah and the children?\nPerhaps there came a thought across her mind that Sarah and the\nchildren had done very little for her,--had considered her very\nlittle, in those old, weary days, in Arundel Street. And those days\nwere not, as yet, so very old. It was now not much more than twelve\nmonths since she had sat by the deathbed of her other brother,--since\nshe had expressed to herself, and to Harry Handcock, a humble wish\nthat she might find herself to be above absolute want.\n\n\"I do not think you need fret about that, Tom,\" she said, after\nturning these things over in her mind for a minute or two.\n\n\"How, not fret about them? But I suppose you know nothing of the\nstate of the business. Has Rubb spoken to you?\"\n\n\"He did say some word as we came along in the cab.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"He said--\"\n\n\"Well, tell me what he said. He said, that if I died--what then? You\nmust not be afraid of speaking of it openly. Why, Margaret, they have\nall told me that it must be in a month or two. What did Rubb say?\"\n\n\"He said that there would be very little coming out of the\nbusiness--that is, for Sarah and the children--if anything were to\nhappen to you.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose they'd get anything. How it has been managed I don't\nknow. I have worked like a galley slave at it, but I haven't kept the\nbooks, and I don't know how things have gone so badly. They have gone\nbadly,--very badly.\"\n\n\"Has it been Mr Rubb's fault?\"\n\n\"I won't say that; and, indeed, if it has been any man's fault it has\nbeen the old man's. I don't want to say a word against the one that\nyou know. Oh, Margaret!\"\n\n\"Don't fret yourself now, Tom.\"\n\n\"If you had seven children, would not you fret yourself? And I hardly\nknow how to speak to you about it. I know that we have already had\never so much of your money, over two thousand pounds; and I fear you\nwill never see it again.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Tom; it is yours, with all my heart. Only, Tom, as it is\nso badly wanted, I would rather it was yours than Mr Rubb's. Could I\nnot do something that would make that share of the building yours?\"\n\nHe shifted himself uneasily in his bed, and made her understand that\nshe had distressed him.\n\n\"But perhaps it will be better to say nothing more about that,\" said\nshe.\n\n\"It will be better that you should understand it all. The property\nbelongs nominally to us, but it is mortgaged to the full of its\nvalue. Rubb can explain it all, if he will. Your money went to buy\nit, but other creditors would not be satisfied without security. Ah,\ndear! it is so dreadful to have to speak of all this in this way.\"\n\n\"Then don't speak of it, Tom.\"\n\n\"But what am I to do?\"\n\n\"Are there no proceeds from the business?\"\n\n\"Yes, for those who work in it; and I think there will be something\ncoming out of it for Sarah,--something, but it will be very small.\nAnd if so, she must depend for it solely on Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"On the young one?\"\n\n\"Yes; on the one that you know.\"\n\nThere was a great deal more said, and of course everyone will know\nhow such a conversation was ended, and will understand with what\nample assurance as to her own intentions Margaret promised that the\nseven children should not want. As she did so, she made certain rapid\ncalculations in her head. She must give up Mr Maguire. There was no\ndoubt about that. She must give up all idea of marrying any one, and,\nas she thought of this, she told herself that she was perhaps well\nrid of a trouble. She had already given away to the firm of Rubb and\nMackenzie above a hundred a-year out of her income. If she divided\nthe remainder with Mrs Tom, keeping about three hundred and fifty\npounds a-year for herself and Susanna, she would, she thought, keep\nher promise well, and yet retain enough for her own comfort and\nSusanna's education. It would be bad for the prospects of young John\nBall, the third of the name, whom she had taught herself to regard as\nher heir; but young John Ball would know nothing of the good things\nhe had lost. As to living with her sister-in-law Sarah, and sharing\nher house and income with the whole family, that she declared to\nherself nothing should induce her to do. She would give up half of\nall that she had, and that half would be quite enough to save her\nbrother's children from want. In making the promise to her brother\nshe said nothing about proportions, and nothing as to her own future\nlife. \"What I have,\" she said, \"I will share with them and you may\nrest assured that they shall not want.\" Of course he thanked her as\ndying men do thank those who take upon themselves such charges; but\nshe perceived as he did so, or thought that she perceived, that he\nstill had something more upon his mind.\n\nMrs Tom came and relieved her in the morning, and Miss Mackenzie was\nobliged to put off for a time that panoply of sick-room armour which\nmade her so indomitable in her brother's bedroom. Downstairs she met\nMr Rubb, who talked to her much about her brother's affairs, and much\nabout the oilcloth business, speaking as though he were desirous\nthat the most absolute confidence should exist between him and her.\nBut she said no word of her promise to her brother, except that she\ndeclared that the money lent was now to be regarded as a present made\nby her to him personally.\n\n\"I am afraid that that will avail nothing,\" said Mr Rubb, junior,\n\"for the amount now stands as a debt due by the firm to you, and the\nfirm, which would pay you the money if it could, cannot pay it to\nyour brother's estate any more than it can to yours.\"\n\n\"But the interest,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"Oh, yes! the interest can be paid,\" said Mr Rubb, junior, but the\ntone of his voice did not give much promise that this interest would\nbe forthcoming with punctuality.\n\nShe watched again that night; and on the next day, in the afternoon,\nshe was told that a gentleman wished to see her in the drawing-room.\nHer thoughts at once pointed to Mr Maguire, and she went downstairs\nprepared to be very angry with that gentleman. But on entering the\nroom she found her cousin, John Ball. She was, in truth, glad to see\nhim; for, after all, she thought that she liked him the best of all\nthe men or women that she knew. He was always in trouble, but then\nshe fancied that with him she at any rate knew the worst. There was\nnothing concealed with him,--nothing to be afraid of. She hoped that\nthey might continue to know each other intimately as cousins. Under\nexisting circumstances they could not, of course, be anything more to\neach other than that.\n\n\"This is very kind of you, John,\" she said, taking his hand. \"How did\nyou know I was here?\"\n\n\"Mr Slow told me. I was with Mr Slow about business of yours. I'm\nafraid from what I hear that you find your brother very ill.\"\n\n\"Very ill, indeed, John,--ill to death.\"\n\nShe then asked after her uncle and aunt, and the children, at the\nCedars.\n\nThey were much as usual, he said; and he added that his mother would\nbe very glad to see her at the Cedars; only he supposed there was no\nhope of that.\n\n\"Not just at present, John. You see I am wholly occupied here.\"\n\n\"And will he really die, do you think?\"\n\n\"The doctors say so.\"\n\n\"And his wife and children--will they be provided for?\"\n\nMargaret simply shook her head, and John Ball, as he watched her,\nfelt assured that his uncle Jonathan's money would never come in\nhis way, or in the way of his children. But he was a man used to\ndisappointment, and he bore this with mild sufferance.\n\nThen he explained to her the business about which he had specially\ncome to her. She had entrusted him with certain arrangements as to\na portion of her property, and he came to tell her that a certain\nrailway company wanted some houses which belonged to her, and that by\nAct of Parliament she was obliged to sell them.\n\n\"But the Act of Parliament will make the railway company pay for\nthem, won't it, John?\"\n\nThen he went on to explain to her that she was in luck's way, \"as\nusual,\" said the poor fellow, thinking of his own misfortunes, and\nthat she would greatly increase her income by the sale. Indeed, it\nseemed to her that she would regain pretty nearly all she had lost by\nthe loan to Rubb and Mackenzie. \"How very singular,\" thought she to\nherself. Under these circumstances, it might, after all, be possible\nthat she should marry Mr Maguire, if she wished it.\n\nWhen Mr Ball had told his business he did not stay much longer. He\nsaid no word of his own hopes, if hopes they could be called any\nlonger. As he left her, he just referred to what had passed between\nthem. \"This is no time, Margaret,\" said he, \"to ask you whether you\nhave changed your mind?\"\n\n\"No, John; there are other things to think of now; are there not?\nAnd, besides, they will want here all that I can do for them.\"\n\nShe spoke to him with an express conviction that what was wanted of\nher by him, as well as by others, was her money, and it did not occur\nto him to contradict her.\n\n\"He might have asked to see me, I do think,\" said Mrs Tom, when John\nBall was gone. \"But there always was an upsetting pride about those\npeople at the Cedars which I never could endure. And they are as poor\nas church mice. When poverty and pride go together I do detest them.\nI suppose he came to find out all about us, but I hope you told him\nnothing.\"\n\nTo all this Miss Mackenzie made no answer at all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nThe Tearing of the Verses\n\n\nThings went on in Gower Street for three or four weeks in the\nsame way, and then Susanna was fetched home from Littlebath. Miss\nMackenzie would have gone down herself but that she was averse to see\nMr Maguire. She therefore kept on her Littlebath lodgings, though Mrs\nTom said much to her of the wasteful extravagance in doing so. It was\nat last settled that Mr Rubb should go down to Littlebath and bring\nSusanna back with him; and this he did, not at all to that young\nlady's satisfaction. It was understood that Susanna did not leave the\nschool, at which she had lately been received as a boarder; but the\nholidays had come, and it was thought well that she should see her\nfather. During this time Miss Mackenzie received two letters from\nMr Maguire. In the first he pleaded hard for an answer to his offer.\nHe had, he said, now relinquished his curacy, having found the\ninterference of that terrible woman to be unendurable. He had left\nhis curacy, and was at present without employment. Under such\ncircumstances, \"his Margaret\" would understand how imperative it\nwas that he should receive an answer. A curacy, or, rather, a small\nincumbency, had offered itself among the mines in Cornwall; but he\ncould not think of accepting this till he should know what \"his\nMargaret\" might say to it.\n\nTo this Margaret answered most demurely, and perhaps a little slily.\nShe said that her brother's health and affairs were at present in\nsuch a condition as to allow her to think of nothing else; that\nshe completely understood Mr Maguire's position, and that it was\nessential that he should not be kept in suspense. Under these\ncombined circumstances she had no alternative but to release him from\nthe offer he had made. This she did with the less unwillingness as\nit was probable that her pecuniary position would be considerably\naltered by the change in her brother's family which they were now\nexpecting almost daily. Then she bade him farewell, with many\nexpressions of her esteem, and said that she hoped he might be happy\namong the mines in Cornwall.\n\nSuch was her letter; but it did not satisfy Mr Maguire, and he wrote\na second letter. He had declined, he said, the incumbency among the\nmines, having heard of something which he thought would suit him\nbetter in Manchester. As to that, there was no immediate hurry, and\nhe proposed remaining at Littlebath for the next two months, having\nbeen asked to undertake temporary duty in a neighbouring church for\nthat time. By the end of the two months he hoped that \"his Margaret\"\nwould be able to give him an answer in a different tone. As to her\npecuniary position, he would leave that, he said, \"all to herself.\"\n\nTo this second letter Miss Mackenzie did not find it necessary to\nsend any reply. The domestics in the Mackenzie family were not\nat this time numerous, and the poor mother had enough to do with\nher family downstairs. No nurse had been hired for the sick man,\nfor nurses cannot be hired without money, and money with the Tom\nMackenzies was scarce. Our Miss Mackenzie would have hired a nurse,\nbut she thought it better to take the work entirely into her own\nhands. She did so, and I think we may say that her brother did not\nsuffer by it. As she sat by his bedside, night after night, she\nseemed to feel that she had fallen again into her proper place, and\nshe looked back upon the year she had spent at Littlebath almost with\ndismay. Since her brother's death, three men had offered to marry\nher, and there was a fourth from whom she had expected such an offer.\nShe looked upon all this with dismay, and told herself that she was\nnot fit to sail, under her own guidance, out in the broad sea, amidst\nsuch rocks as those. Was not some humbly feminine employment, such as\nthat in which she was now engaged, better for her in all ways? Sad\nas was the present occasion, did she not feel a satisfaction in what\nshe was doing, and an assurance that she was fit for her position?\nHad she not always been ill at ease, and out of her element, while\nstriving at Littlebath to live the life of a lady of fortune? She\ntold herself that it was so, and that it would be better for her to\nbe a hard-working, dependent woman, doing some tedious duty day by\nday, than to live a life of ease which prompted her to longings for\nthings unfitted to her.\n\nShe had brought a little writing-desk with her that she had carried\nfrom Arundel Street to Littlebath, and this she had with her in the\nsick man's bedroom. Sitting there through the long hours of night,\nshe would open this and read over and over again those remnants of\nthe rhymes written in her early days which she had kept when she made\nher great bonfire. There had been quires of such verses, but she had\ndestroyed all but a few leaves before she started for Littlebath.\nWhat were left, and were now read, were very sweet to her, and yet\nshe knew that they were wrong and meaningless. What business had such\na one as she to talk of the sphere's tune and the silvery moon, of\nbright stars shining and hearts repining? She would not for worlds\nhave allowed any one to know what a fool she had been--either Mrs\nTom, or John Ball, or Mr Maguire, or Miss Todd. She would have been\ncovered with confusion if her rhymes had fallen into the hands of any\none of them.\n\nAnd yet she loved them well, as a mother loves her only idiot child.\nThey were her expressions of the romance and poetry that had been\nin her; and though the expressions doubtless were poor, the romance\nand poetry of her heart had been high and noble. How wrong the world\nis in connecting so closely as it does the capacity for feeling and\nthe capacity for expression,--in thinking that capacity for the one\nimplies capacity for the other, or incapacity for the one incapacity\nalso for the other; in confusing the technical art of the man who\nsings with the unselfish tenderness of the man who feels! But the\nworld does so connect them; and, consequently, those who express\nthemselves badly are ashamed of their feelings.\n\nShe read her poor lines again and again, throwing herself back into\nthe days and thoughts of former periods, and telling herself that\nit was all over. She had thought of encouraging love, and love had\ncome to her in the shape of Mr Maguire, a very strict evangelical\nclergyman, without a cure or an income, somewhat in debt, and with,\noh! such an eye! She tore the papers, very gently, into the smallest\nfragments. She tore them again and again, swearing to herself as she\ndid so that there should be an end of all that; and, as there was\nno fire at hand, she replaced the pieces in her desk. During this\nceremony of the tearing she devoted herself to the duties of a single\nlife, to the drudgeries of ordinary utility, to such works as those\nshe was now doing. As to any society, wicked or religious,--wicked\nafter the manner of Miss Todd, or religious after the manner of St\nStumfolda,--it should come or not, as circumstances might direct. She\nwould go no more in search of it. Such were the resolves of a certain\nnight, during which the ceremony of the tearing took place.\n\nIt came to pass at this time that Mr Rubb, junior, visited his dying\npartner almost daily, and was always left alone with him for some\ntime. When these visits were made Miss Mackenzie would descend to the\nroom in which her sister-in-law was sitting, and there would be some\nconversation between them about Mr Rubb and his affairs. Much as\nthese two women disliked each other, there had necessarily arisen\nbetween them a certain amount of confidence. Two persons who are much\nthrown together, to the exclusion of other society, will tell each\nother their thoughts, even though there be no love between them.\n\n\"What is he saying to him all these times when he is with him?\"\nsaid Mrs Tom one morning, when Miss Mackenzie had come down on the\nappearance of Mr Rubb in the sick room.\n\n\"He is talking about the business, I suppose.\"\n\n\"What good can that do? Tom can't say anything about that, as to how\nit should be done. He thinks a great deal about Sam Rubb; but it's\nmore than I do.\"\n\n\"They must necessarily be in each other's confidence, I should say.\"\n\n\"He's not in my confidence. My belief is he's been a deal too clever\nfor Tom; and that he'll turn out to be too clever--for me, and--my\npoor orphans.\" Upon which Mrs Tom put her handkerchief up to her\neyes. \"There; he's coming down,\" continued the wife. \"Do you go up\nnow, and make Tom tell you what it is that Sam Rubb has been saying\nto him.\"\n\nMargaret Mackenzie did go up as she heard Mr Rubb close the\nfront door; but she had no such purpose as that with which her\nsister-in-law had striven to inspire her. She had no wish to make\nthe sick man tell her anything that he did not wish to tell. In\nconsidering the matter within her own breast, she owned to herself\nthat she did not expect much from the Rubbs in aid of the wants of\nher nephews and nieces; but what would be the use of troubling a\ndying man about that? She had agreed with herself to believe that\nthe oilcloth business was a bad affair, and that it would be well to\nhope for nothing from it. That her brother to the last should harass\nhimself about the business was only natural; but there could be\nno reason why she should harass him on the same subject. She had\nrecognised the fact that his widow and children must be supported by\nher; and had she now been told that the oilcloth factory had been\nabsolutely abandoned as being worth nothing, it would not have caused\nher much disappointment. She thought a great deal more of the railway\ncompany that was going to buy her property under such favourable\ncircumstances.\n\nShe was, therefore, much surprised when her brother began about the\nbusiness as soon as she had seated herself. I do not know that the\nreader need be delayed with any of the details that he gave her, or\nwith the contents of the papers which he showed her. She, however,\nfound herself compelled to go into the matter, and compelled also\nto make an endeavour to understand it. It seemed that everything\nhung upon Samuel Rubb, junior, except the fact that Samuel Rubb's\nfather, who now never went near the place, got more than half the net\nprofits; and the further fact, that the whole thing would come to an\nend if this payment to old Rubb were stopped.\n\n\"Tom,\" said she, in the middle of it all, when her head was aching\nwith figures, \"if it will comfort you, and enable you to put all\nthese things away, you may know that I will divide everything I have\nwith Sarah.\"\n\nHe assured her that her kindness did comfort him; but he hoped better\nthan that; he still thought that something better might be arranged\nif she would only go on with her task. So she went on painfully\ntoiling through figures.\n\n\"Sam drew them up on purpose for you, yesterday afternoon,\" said he.\n\n\"Who did it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Samuel Rubb.\"\n\nHe then went on to declare that she might accept all Samuel Rubb's\nfigures as correct.\n\nShe was quite willing to accept them, and she strove hard to\nunderstand them. It certainly did seem to her that when her money was\nborrowed somebody must have known that the promised security would\nnot be forthcoming; but perhaps that somebody was old Rubb, whom, as\nshe did not know him, she was quite ready to regard as the villain in\nthe play that was being acted. Her own money, too, was a thing of the\npast. That fault, if fault there had been, was condoned; and she was\nangry with herself in that she now thought of it again.\n\n\"And now,\" said her brother, as soon as she had put the papers back,\nand declared that she understood them. \"Now I have something to say\nto you which I hope you will hear without being angry.\" He raised\nhimself on his bed as he said this, doing so with difficulty and\npain, and turning his face upon her so that he could look into her\neyes. \"If I didn't know that I was dying I don't think that I could\nsay it to you.\"\n\n\"Say what, Tom?\"\n\nShe thought of what most terrible thing it might be possible that\nhe should have to communicate. Could it be that he had got hold, or\nthat Rubb and Mackenzie had got hold, of all her fortune, and turned\nit into unprofitable oilcloth? Could they in any way have made her\nresponsible for their engagements? She wished to trust them; she\ntried to avoid suspicion; but she feared that things were amiss.\n\n\"Samuel Rubb and I have been talking of it, and he thinks it had\nbetter come from me,\" said her brother.\n\n\"What had better come?\" she asked.\n\n\"It is his proposition, Margaret.\" Then she knew all about it, and\nfelt great relief. Then she knew all about it, and let him go on till\nhe had spoken his speech.\n\n\"God knows how far he may be indulging a false hope, or deceiving\nhimself altogether; but he thinks it possible that you might--might\nbecome fond of him. There, Margaret, that's the long and the short\nof it. And when I told him that he had better say that himself, he\ndeclared that you would not bring yourself to listen to him while I\nam lying here dying.\"\n\n\"Of course I would not.\"\n\n\"But, look here, Margaret; I know you would do much to comfort me in\nmy last moments.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I would, Tom.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't ask you to marry a man you didn't like,--not even if it\nwere to do the children a service; but if that can be got over, the\nother feeling should not restrain you when it would be the greatest\npossible comfort to me.\"\n\n\"But how could it serve you, Tom?\"\n\n\"If that could be arranged, Rubb would give up to Sarah during his\nfather's life all the proceeds of the business, after paying the\nold man. And when he dies, and he is very old now, the five hundred\na-year would be continued to her. Think what that would be,\nMargaret.\"\n\n\"But, Tom, she shall have what will make her comfortable without\nwaiting for any old man's death. It shall be quite half of my income.\nIf that is not enough it shall be more. Will not that do for her?\"\n\nThen her brother strove to explain as best he could that the mere\nmoney was not all he wanted. If his sister did not like this man, if\nshe had no wish to become a married woman, of course, he said, the\nplan must fall to the ground. But if there was anything in Mr Rubb's\nbelief that she was not altogether indifferent to him, if such an\narrangement could be made palatable to her, then he would be able to\nthink that he, by the work of his life, had left something behind him\nto his wife and family.\n\n\"And Sarah would be more comfortable,\" he pleaded. \"Of course, she\nis grateful to you, as I am, and as we all are. But given bread is\nbitter bread, and if she could think it came to her, of her own\nright--\"\n\nHe said ever so much more, but that ever so much more was quite\nunnecessary. His sister understood the whole matter. It was desirable\nthat she, by her fortune, should enable the widow and orphans of\nher brother to live in comfort; but it was not desirable that this\ndependence on her should be plainly recognised. She did not, however,\nfeel herself to be angry or hurt. It would, no doubt, be better\nfor the family that they should draw their income in an apparently\nindependent way from their late father's business than that they\nshould owe their support to the charity of an aunt. But then, how\nabout herself? A month or two ago, before the Maguire feature in\nher career had displayed itself so strongly, an overture from Mr\nRubb might probably not have been received with disfavour. But now,\nwhile she was as it were half engaged to another man, she could not\nentertain such a proposition. Her womanly feeling revolted from it.\nNo doubt she intended to refuse Mr Maguire. No doubt she had made up\nher mind to that absolutely, during the ceremony of tearing up her\nverses. And she had never had much love for Mr Maguire, and had felt\nsome--almost some, for Mr Rubb. In either case she was sure that, had\nshe married the man,--the one man or the other,--she would instantly\nhave become devoted to him. And I, who chronicle her deeds and\nendeavour to chronicle her thoughts, feel equally sure that it would\nhave been so. There was something harsh in it, that Mr Maguire's\noffer to her should, though never accepted, debar her from the\npossibility of marrying Mr Rubb, and thus settling all the affairs of\nher family in a way that would have been satisfactory to them and not\naltogether unsatisfactory to her; but she was aware that it did so.\nShe felt that it was so, and then threw herself back for consolation\nupon the security which would still be hers, and the want of security\nwhich must attach itself to a marriage with Mr Rubb. He might make\nducks, and drakes, and oilcloth of it all; and then there would be\nnothing left for her, for her sister-in-law, or for the children.\n\n\"May I tell him to speak to yourself?\" her brother asked, while she\nwas thinking of all this.\n\n\"No, Tom; it would do no good.\"\n\n\"You do not fancy him, then.\"\n\n\"I do not know about fancying; but I think it will be better for me\nto remain as I am. I would do anything for you and Sarah, almost\nanything; but I cannot do that.\"\n\n\"Then I will say nothing further.\"\n\n\"Don't ask me to do that.\"\n\nAnd he did not ask her again, but turned his face from her and\nthought of the bitterness of his death-bed.\n\nThat evening, when she went down to tea, she met Samuel Rubb standing\nat the drawing-room door.\n\n\"There is no one here,\" he said; \"will you mind coming in? Has your\nbrother spoken to you?\"\n\nShe had followed him into the room, and he had closed the door as he\nasked the question.\n\n\"Yes, he has spoken to me.\"\n\nShe could see that the man was trembling with anxiety and eagerness,\nand she almost loved him that he was anxious and eager. Mr Maguire,\nwhen he had come a wooing, had not done it badly altogether, but\nthere had not been so much reality as there was about Sam Rubb while\nhe stood there shaking, and fearing, and hoping.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"may I hope--may I think it will be so? may I ask\nyou to be mine?\"\n\nHe was handsome in her eyes, though perhaps, delicate reader, he\nwould not have been handsome in yours. She knew that he was not a\ngentleman; but what did that matter? Neither was her sister-in-law\nSarah a lady. There was not much in that house in Gower Street that\nwas after the manner of gentlemen and ladies. She was ready to throw\nall that to the dogs, and would have done so but for Mr Maguire. She\nfelt that she would like to have allowed herself to love him in spite\nof the tearing of the verses. She felt this, and was very angry with\nMr Maguire. But the facts were stern, and there was no hope for her.\n\n\"Mr Rubb,\" she said, \"there can be nothing of that kind.\"\n\n\"Can't there really, now?\" said he.\n\nShe assured him in her strongest language, that there could be\nnothing of that kind, and then went down to the dining-room.\n\nHe did not venture to follow her, but made his way out of the house\nwithout seeing anyone else.\n\nAnother fortnight went by, and then, towards the close of September,\ncame the end of all things in this world for poor Tom Mackenzie. He\ndied in the middle of the night in his wife's arms, while his sister\nstood by holding both their hands. Since the day on which he had\nendeavoured to arrange a match between his partner and his sister he\nhad spoken no word of business, at any rate to the latter, and things\nnow stood on that footing which she had then attempted to give them.\nWe all know how silent on such matters are the voices of all in the\nbereft household, from the hour of death till that other hour in\nwhich the body is consigned to its kindred dust. Women make mourning,\nand men creep about listlessly, but during those few sad days\nthere may be no talk about money. So it was in Gower Street. The\nwidow, no doubt, thought much of her bitter state of dependence,\nthought something, perhaps, of the chance there might be that her\nhusband's sister would be less good than her word, now that he was\ngone--meditated with what amount of submission she must accept the\ngenerosity of the woman she had always hated; but she was still\nmistress of that house till the undertakers had done their work; and\ntill that work had been done, she said little of her future plans.\n\n\"I'd earn my bread, if I knew how,\" she began, putting her\nhandkerchief up to her eyes, on the afternoon of the very day on\nwhich he was buried.\n\n\"There will be no occasion for that, Sarah,\" said Miss Mackenzie,\n\"there will be enough for us all.\"\n\n\"But I would if I knew how. I wouldn't mind what I did; I'd scour\nfloors rather than be dependent, I've that spirit in me; and I've\nworked, and moiled, and toiled with those children; so I have.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie then told her that she had solemnly promised her\nbrother to divide her income with his widow, and informed her that\nshe intended to see Mr Slow, the lawyer, on the following day, with\nreference to the doing of this.\n\n\"If there is anything from the factory, that can be divided too,\"\nsaid Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"But there won't. The Rubbs will take all that; of course they will.\nAnd Tom put into it near upon ten thousand pounds!\"\n\nThen she began to cry again, but soon interrupted her tears to ask\nwhat was to become of Susanna. Susanna, who was by, looked anxiously\nup into her aunt's eyes.\n\n\"Susanna and I,\" said the aunt, \"have thrown in our lot together, and\nwe mean to remain so; don't we, dear?\"\n\n\"If mamma will let me.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it's very good of you to take one off my hands,\" said the\nmother, \"for even one will be felt.\"\n\nThen came a note to Miss Mackenzie from Lady Ball, asking\nher to spend a few days at the Cedars before she returned to\nLittlebath,--that is, if she did return,--and she consented to\ndo this. While she was there Mr Slow could prepare the necessary\narrangements for the division of the property, and she could then\nmake up her mind as to the manner and whereabouts of her future life.\nShe was all at sea again, and knew not how to choose. If she were a\nRomanist, she would go into a convent; but Protestant convents she\nthought were bad, and peculiarly unfitted for the followers of Mr\nStumfold. She had nothing to bind her to any spot, and something to\ndrive her from every spot of which she knew anything.\n\nBefore she went to the Cedars Mr Rubb came to Gower Street and bade\nher farewell.\n\n\"I had allowed myself to hope, Miss Mackenzie,\" said he, \"I had,\nindeed; I suppose I was very foolish.\"\n\n\"I don't know as to being foolish, Mr Rubb, unless it was in caring\nabout such a person as me.\"\n\n\"I do care for you, very much; but I suppose I was wrong to think you\nwould put up with such as I am. Only I did think that perhaps, seeing\nthat we had been partners with your brother so long-- All the same, I\nknow that the Mackenzies are different from the Rubbs.\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it; nothing in the least.\"\n\n\"Hasn't it now? Then, perhaps, Miss Mackenzie, at some future time--\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie was obliged to tell him that there could not possibly\nbe any other answer given to him at any future time than that which\nshe gave him now. He suggested that perhaps he might be allowed to\ntry again when the first month or two of her grief for her brother\nshould be over; but she assured him that it would be useless. At the\nmoment of her conference with him, she did this with all her energy;\nand then, as soon as she was alone, she asked herself why she had\nbeen so energetical. After all, marriage was an excellent state in\nwhich to live. The romance was doubtless foolish and wrong, and the\ntearing of the papers had been discreet, yet there could be no good\nreason why she should turn her back upon sober wedlock. Nevertheless,\nin all her speech to Mr Rubb she did do so. There was something in\nher position as connected with Mr Maguire which made her feel that it\nwould be indelicate to entertain another suitor before that gentleman\nhad received a final answer.\n\nAs she went away from Gower Street to the Cedars she thought of this\nvery sadly, and told herself that she had been like the ass who\nstarved between two bundles of hay, or as the boy who had fallen\nbetween two stools.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nLady Ball's Grievance\n\n\nMiss Mackenzie, before she left Gower Street, was forced to make\nsome arrangements as to her affairs at Littlebath, and these were\nultimately settled in a manner that was not altogether palatable to\nher. Mr Rubb was again sent down, having Susanna in his charge, and\nhe was empowered to settle with Miss Mackenzie's landlady and give\nup the lodgings. There was much that was disagreeable in this. Miss\nMackenzie having just rejected Mr Rubb's suit, did not feel quite\ncomfortable in giving him a commission to see all her stockings and\npetticoats packed up and brought away from the lodgings. Indeed, she\ncould give him no commission of the kind, but intimated her intention\nof writing to the lodging-house keeper. He, however, was profuse\nin his assurances that nothing should be left behind, and if Miss\nMackenzie would tell him anything of the way in which the things\nought to be packed, he would be so happy to attend to her! To him\nMiss Mackenzie would give no such instructions, but, doubtless, she\ngave many to Susanna.\n\nAs to Susanna, it was settled that she should remain as a boarder at\nthe Littlebath school, at any rate for the next half-year. After that\nthere might be great doubt whether her aunt could bear the expense of\nmaintaining her in such a position.\n\nMiss Mackenzie had reconciled herself to going to the Cedars because\nshe would thus have an opportunity of seeing her lawyer and arranging\nabout her property, whereas had she been down at Littlebath there\nwould have been a difficulty. And she wanted some one whom she could\ntrust to act for her, some one besides the lawyer, and she thought\nthat she could trust her cousin, John Ball. As to getting away from\nall her suitors that was impossible. Had she gone to Littlebath there\nwas one there; had she remained with her sister-in-law, she would\nhave been always near another; and, on going to the Cedars, she would\nmeet the third. But she could not on that account absolutely isolate\nherself from everybody that she knew in the world. And, perhaps, she\nwas getting somewhat used to her suitors, and less liable than she\nhad been to any fear that they could force her into action against\nher own consent. So she went to the Cedars, and, on arriving there,\nreceived from her uncle and aunt but a moderate amount of condolence\nas to the death of her brother.\n\nHer first and second days in her aunt's house were very quiet.\nNothing was said of John's former desires, and nothing about her own\nmoney or her brother's family. On the morning of the third day she\ntold her cousin that she would, on the next morning, accompany him\nto town if he would allow her. \"I am going to Mr Slow's,\" said she,\n\"and perhaps you could go with me.\" To this he assented willingly,\nand then, after a pause, surmised that her visit must probably have\nreference to the sale of her houses to the railway company. \"Partly\nto that,\" she said, \"but it chiefly concerns arrangements for my\nbrother's family.\"\n\nTo this John Ball said nothing, nor did Lady Ball, who was present,\nthen speak. But Miss Mackenzie could see that her aunt looked at her\ncousin, opening her eyes, and expressing concern. John Ball himself\nallowed no change to come upon his face, but went on deliberately\nwith his bread and butter. \"I shall be very happy to go with you,\" he\nsaid, \"and will either come and call for you when you have done, or\nstay with you while you are there, just as you like.\"\n\n\"I particularly want you to stay with me,\" said she, \"and as we go up\nto town I will tell you all about it.\"\n\nShe observed that before her cousin left the house on that day, his\nmother got hold of him and was alone with him for nearly half an\nhour. After that, Lady Ball was alone with Sir John, in his own room,\nfor another half hour. The old baronet had become older, of course,\nand much weaker, since his niece had last been at the Cedars, and was\nnow seldom seen about the house till the afternoon.\n\nOf all the institutions at the Cedars that of the carriage was the\nmost important. Miss Mackenzie found that the carriage arrangement\nhad been fixed upon a new and more settled basis since her last\nvisit. Then it used to go out perhaps as often as three times a week.\nBut there did not appear to be any fixed rule. Like other carriages,\nit did, to a certain degree, come when it was wanted. But now there\nwas, as I have said, a settled basis. The carriage came to the door\non Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, exactly at two o'clock, and\nSir John with Lady Ball were driven about till four.\n\nOn the first Tuesday of her visit Miss Mackenzie had gone with her\nuncle and aunt, and even she had found the pace to be very slow, and\nthe whole affair to be very dull. Her uncle had once enlivened the\nthing by asking her whether she had found any lovers since she went\nto Littlebath, and this question had perplexed her very much. She\ncould not say that she had found none, and as she was not prepared\nto acknowledge that she had found any, she could only sit still and\nblush.\n\n\"Women have plenty of lovers when they have plenty of money,\" said\nthe baronet.\n\n\"I don't believe that Margaret thinks of anything of the kind,\" said\nLady Ball.\n\nAfter that Margaret determined to have as little to do with the\ncarriage as possible, and on that evening she learned from her cousin\nthat the horses had been sold to the man who farmed the land, and\nwere hired every other day for two hours' work.\n\nIt was on the Thursday morning that Miss Mackenzie had spoken of\ngoing into town on the morrow, and on that day when her aunt asked\nher about the driving, she declined.\n\n\"I hope that nothing your uncle said on Tuesday annoyed you?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no; but if you don't mind it, I'd rather stay at home.\"\n\n\"Of course you shall if you like it,\" said her aunt; \"and by-the-by,\nas I want to speak to you, and as we might not find time after coming\nhome, if you don't mind it I'll do it now.\"\n\nOf course Margaret said that she did not mind it, though in truth she\ndid mind it, and was afraid of her aunt.\n\n\"Well then, Margaret, look here. I want to know something about your\nbrother's affairs. From what I have heard, I fear they were not very\ngood.\"\n\n\"They were very bad, aunt,--very bad indeed.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear; you don't say so. Sir John always feared that it would\nbe so when Thomas Mackenzie mixed himself up with those Rubbs. And\nthere has gone half of Jonathan Ball's money,--money which Sir John\nmade! Well, well!\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie had nothing to say to this; and as she had nothing to\nsay to it she sat silent, making no attempt at any words.\n\n\"It does seem hard; don't it, my dear?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't make any difference to anybody now--to my uncle, I mean,\nor to John, if the money was not gone.\"\n\n\"That's quite true; quite true; only it does seem to be a pity.\nHowever, that half of Jonathan's money which you have got, is not\nlost, and there's some comfort in that.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie was not called upon to make any answer to this; for\nalthough she had lost a large sum of money by lending it to her\nbrother, nevertheless she was still possessed of a larger sum of\nmoney than that which her brother Walter had received from Jonathan\nBall.\n\n\"And what are they going to do, my dear--the children, I mean, and\nthe widow? I suppose there'll be something for them out of the\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"I don't think there'll be anything, aunt. As far as I can understand\nthere will be nothing certain. They may probably get a hundred and\ntwenty-five pounds a-year.\" This she named, as being the interest of\nthe money she had lent--or given.\n\n\"A hundred and twenty-five pounds a-year. That isn't much, but it\nwill keep them from absolute want.\"\n\n\"Would it, aunt?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; at least, I suppose so. I hope she's a good manager. She\nought to be, for she's a very disagreeable woman. You told me that\nyourself, you know.\"\n\nThen Miss Mackenzie, having considered for one moment, resolved to\nmake a clean breast of it all, and this she did with the fewest\npossible words.\n\n\"I'm going to divide what I've got with them, and I hope it will make\nthem comfortable.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed her aunt.\n\n\"I'm going to give Sarah half what I've got, for her and her\nchildren. I shall have enough to live on left.\"\n\n\"Margaret, you don't mean it?\"\n\n\"Not mean it? why not, aunt? You would not have me let them starve.\nBesides, I promised my brother when he was dying.\"\n\n\"Then I must say he was very wrong, very wicked, I may say, to exact\nany such promise from you; and no such promise is binding. If you\nask Sir John, or your lawyer, they will tell you so. What! exact\na promise from you to the amount of half your income. It was very\nwrong.\"\n\n\"But, aunt, I should do the same if I had made no promise.\"\n\n\"No, you wouldn't, my dear. Your friends wouldn't let you. And indeed\nyour friends must prevent it now. They will not hear of such a\nsacrifice being made.\"\n\n\"But, aunt--\"\n\n\"Well, my dear.\"\n\n\"It's my own, you know.\" And Margaret, as she said this, plucked up\nher courage, and looked her aunt full in the face.\n\n\"Yes, it is your own, by law; but I don't suppose, my dear, that you\nare of that disposition or that character that you'd wish to set all\nthe world at defiance, and make everybody belonging to you feel that\nyou had disgraced yourself.\"\n\n\"Disgraced myself by relieving my brother's family!\"\n\n\"Disgraced yourself by giving to that woman money that has come\nto you as your fortune has come. Think of it, where it came from!\"\n\n\"It came to me from my brother Walter.\"\n\n\"And where did he get it? And who made it? And don't you know that\nyour brother Tom had his share of it, and wasted it all? Did it\nnot all come from the Balls? And yet you think so little of that,\nthat you are going to let that woman rob you of it--rob you and my\ngrandchildren; for that, I tell you, is the way in which the world\nwill look at it. Perhaps you don't know it, but all that property\nwas as good as given to John at one time. Who was it first took\nyou by the hand when you were left all alone in Arundel Street? Oh,\nMargaret, don't go and be such an ungrateful, foolish creature!\"\n\nMargaret waited for a moment, and then she answered--\n\n\"There's nobody so near to me as my own brother's children.\"\n\n\"As to that, Margaret, there isn't much difference in nearness\nbetween your uncle and your nephews and nieces. But there's a right\nand a wrong in these things, and when money is concerned, people\nare not justified in indulging their fancies. Everything here has\nbeen told to you. You know how John is situated with his children.\nAnd after what there has been between you and him, and after what\nthere still might be if you would have it so, I own that I am\nastonished--fairly astonished. Indeed, my dear, I can only look on it\nas simple weakness on your part. It was but the other day that you\ntold me you had done all that you thought necessary by your brother\nin taking Susanna.\"\n\n\"But that was when he was alive, and I thought he was doing well.\"\n\n\"The fact is, you have been there and they've talked you over. It\ncan't be that you love children that you never saw till the other\nday; and as for the woman, you always hated her.\"\n\n\"Whether I love her or hate her has nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"Margaret, will you promise me this, that you will see Mr Slow and\ntalk to him about it before you do anything?\"\n\n\"I must see Mr Slow before I can do anything; but whatever he says, I\nshall do it all the same.\"\n\n\"Will you speak to your uncle?\"\n\n\"I had rather not.\"\n\n\"You are afraid to tell him of this; but of course he must be told.\nWill you speak to John?\"\n\n\"Certainly; I meant to do so going to town to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And if he tells you you are wrong--\"\n\n\"Aunt, I know I am not wrong. It is nonsense to say that I am wrong\nin--\"\n\n\"That's disrespectful, Margaret!\"\n\n\"I don't want to be disrespectful, aunt; but in such a case as this\nI know that I have a right to do what I like with my own money. If\nI was going to give it away to any other friend, if I was going to\nmarry, or anything like that,\"--she blushed at the remembrance of\nthe iniquities she had half intended as she said this--\"then there\nmight be some reason for you to scold me; but with a brother and\na brother's family it can't be wrong. If you had a brother, and\nhad been with him when he was dying, and he had left his wife and\nchildren looking to you, you would have done the same.\"\n\nUpon this Lady Ball got up from her chair and walked to the door.\nMargaret had been more impetuous and had answered her with much more\nconfidence than she had expected. She was determined now to say one\nmore word, but so to say it that it should not be answered--to strike\none more blow, but so to strike it that it should not be returned.\n\n\"Margaret,\" she said, as she stood with the door open in her hands,\n\"if you will reflect where the money came from, your conscience will\ntell you without much difficulty where it should go to. And when you\nthink of your brother's children, whom this time last year you had\nhardly seen, think also of John Ball's children, who have welcomed\nyou into this house as their dearest relative. In one sense,\ncertainly, the money is yours, Margaret; but in another sense, and\nthat the highest sense, it is not yours to do what you please with\nit.\"\n\nThen Lady Ball shut the door rather loudly, and sailed away along the\nhall. When the passages were clear, Miss Mackenzie made her way up\ninto her own room, and saw none of the family till she came down just\nbefore dinner.\n\nShe sat for a long time in the chair by her bed-side thinking of her\nposition. Was it true after all that she was bound by a sense of\njustice to give any of her money to the Balls? It was true that in\none sense it had been taken from them, but she had had nothing to do\nwith the taking. If her brother Walter had married and had children,\nthen the Balls would have not expected the money back again. It was\never so many years,--five-and-twenty years, and more since the legacy\nhad been made by Jonathan Ball to her brother, and it seemed to her\nthat her aunt had no common sense on her side in the argument. Was it\npossible that she should allow her own nephews and nieces to starve\nwhile she was rich? She had, moreover, made a promise,--a promise to\none who was now dead, and there was a solemnity in that which carried\neverything else before it. Even though the thing might be unjust,\nstill she must do it.\n\nBut she was to give only half her fortune to her brother's family;\nthere would still be the half left for herself, for herself or\nfor these Balls if they wanted it so sorely. She was beginning to\nhate her money. It had brought to her nothing but tribulation and\ndisappointment. Had Walter left her a hundred a year, she would,\nnot having then dreamed of higher things, have been amply content.\nWould it not be better that she should take for herself some modest\ncompetence, something on which she might live without trouble to her\nrelatives, without trouble to her friends she had first said,--but\nas she did so she told herself with scorn that friends she had\nnone,--and then let the Balls have what was left her after she had\nkept her promise to her brother? Anything would be better than such\npersecution as that to which her aunt had subjected her.\n\nAt last she made up her mind to speak of it all openly to her cousin.\nShe had an idea that in such matters men were more trustworthy than\nwomen, and perhaps less greedy. Her cousin would, she thought, be\nmore just to her than her aunt had been. That her aunt had been very\nunjust,--cruel and unjust,--she felt assured.\n\nShe came down to dinner, and she could see by the manner of them all\nthat the matter had been discussed since John Ball's return from\nLondon. Jack, the eldest son, was not at home, and the three girls\nwho came next to Jack dined with their father and grandfather. To\nthem Margaret endeavoured to talk easily, but she failed. They had\nnever been favourites with her as Jack was, and, on this occasion,\nshe could get very little from them that was satisfactory to her.\nJohn Ball was courteous to her, but he was very silent throughout the\nwhole evening. Her aunt showed her displeasure by not speaking to\nher, or speaking barely with a word. Her uncle, of whose voice she\nwas always in fear, seemed to be more cross, and when he did speak,\nmore sarcastic than ever. He asked her whether she intended to go\nback to Littlebath.\n\n\"I think not,\" said she.\n\n\"Then that has been a failure, I suppose,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Everything is a failure, I think,\" said she, with tears in her eyes.\n\nThis was in the drawing-room, and immediately her cousin John came\nand sat by her. He came and sat there, as though he had intended\nto speak to her; but he went away again in a minute or two without\nhaving uttered a word. Things went on in the same way till they\nmoved off to bed, and then the formal adieus for the night were made\nwith a coldness that amounted, on the part of Lady Ball, almost to\ninhospitality.\n\n\"Good-night, Margaret,\" she said, as she just put out the tip of her\nfinger.\n\n\"Good-night, my dear,\" said Sir John. \"I don't know what's the matter\nwith you, but you look as though you'd been doing something that you\nwere ashamed of.\"\n\nLady Ball was altogether injudicious in her treatment of her niece.\nAs to Sir John, it made probably very little difference. Miss\nMackenzie had perceived, when she first came to the Cedars, that he\nwas a cross old man, and that he had to be endured as such by any one\nwho chose to go into that house. But she had depended on Lady Ball\nfor kindness of manner, and had been tempted to repeat her visits to\nthe house because her aunt had, after her fashion, been gracious to\nher. But now there was rising in her breast a feeling that she had\nbetter leave the Cedars as soon as she could shake the dust off her\nfeet, and see nothing more of the Balls. Even the Rubb connection\nseemed to her to be better than the Ball connection, and less\nexaggerated in its greediness. Were it not for her cousin John, she\nwould have resolved to go on the morrow. She would have faced the\nindignation of her aunt, and the cutting taunts of her uncle, and\nhave taken herself off at once to some lodging in London. But John\nBall had meant to be kind to her when he came and sat close to her on\nthe sofa, and her soft heart relented towards him.\n\nLady Ball had in truth mistaken her niece's character. She had found\nher to be unobtrusive, gentle, and unselfish; and had conceived that\nshe must therefore be weak and compliant. As to many things she was\ncompliant, and as to some things she was weak; but there was in her\ncomposition a power of resistance and self-sustenance on which Lady\nBall had not counted. When conscious of absolute ill-usage, she could\nfight well, and would not bow her neck to any Mrs Stumfold or to any\nLady Ball.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nMr Slow's Chambers\n\n\nShe came down late to breakfast on the following morning, not being\npresent at prayers, and when she came down she wore a bonnet.\n\n\"I got myself ready, John, for fear I should keep you waiting.\"\n\nHer aunt spoke to her somewhat more graciously than on the preceding\nevening, and accepted her apology for being late.\n\nJust as she was about to start Lady Ball took her apart and spoke one\nword to her.\n\n\"No one can tell you better what you ought to do than your cousin\nJohn; but pray remember that he is far too generous to say a word for\nhimself.\"\n\nMargaret made no answer, and then she and her cousin started on foot\nacross the grounds to the station. The distance was nearly a mile,\nand during the walk no word was said between them about the money.\nThey got into the train that was to take them up to London, and sat\nopposite to each other. It happened that there was no passenger in\neither of the seats next to him or her, so that there was ample\nopportunity for them to hold a private conversation; but Mr Ball said\nnothing to her, and she, not knowing how to begin, said nothing to\nhim. In this way they reached the London station at Waterloo Bridge,\nand then he asked her what she proposed to do next.\n\n\"Shall we go to Mr Slow's at once?\" she asked.\n\nTo this he assented, and at her proposition they agreed to walk to\nthe lawyer's chambers. These were on the north side of Lincoln's Inn\nFields, near the Turnstile, and Mr Ball remarked that the distance\nwas again not much above a mile. So they crossed the Strand together,\nand made their way by narrow streets into Drury Lane, and then under\na certain archway into Lincoln's Inn Fields. To Miss Mackenzie, who\nfelt that something ought to be said, the distance and time occupied\nseemed to be very short.\n\n\"Why, this is Lincoln's Inn Fields!\" she exclaimed, as she came out\nupon the west side.\n\n\"Yes; this is Lincoln's Inn Fields, and Mr Slow's chambers are over\nthere.\"\n\nShe knew very well where Mr Slow's chambers were situated, but she\npaused on the pavement, not wishing to go thither quite at once.\n\n\"John,\" she said, \"I thought that perhaps we might have talked over\nall this before we saw Mr Slow.\"\n\n\"Talked over all what?\"\n\n\"About the money that I want to give to my brother's family. Did not\nmy aunt tell you of it?\"\n\n\"Yes; she told me that you and she had differed.\"\n\n\"And she told you what about?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, slowly; \"she told me what about.\"\n\n\"And what ought I to do, John?\"\n\nAs she asked the question she caught hold of the lappet of his coat,\nand looked up into his face as though supplicating him to give her\nthe advantage of all his discretion and all his honesty.\n\nThey were still standing on the pavement, where the street comes out\nfrom under the archway. She was gazing into his face, and he was\nlooking away from her, over towards the inner railings of the square,\nwith heavy brow and dull eye and motionless face. She was very eager,\nand he seemed to be simply patient, but nevertheless he was working\nhard with his thoughts, striving to determine how best he might\nanswer her. His mother had told him that he might model this woman to\nhis will, and had repeated to him that story which he had heard so\noften of the wrong that had been done to him by his uncle Jonathan.\nIt may be said that there was no need for such repetition, as John\nBall had himself always thought quite enough of that injury. He had\nthought of it for the last twenty years, almost hourly, till it was\ngraven upon his very soul. He had been a ruined, wretched, moody man,\nbecause of his uncle Jonathan's will. There was no need, one would\nhave said, to have stirred him on that subject. But his mother, on\nthis morning, in the ten minutes before prayer-time, had told him\nof it all again, and had told him also that the last vestige of his\nuncle's money would now disappear from him unless he interfered to\nsave it.\n\n\"On this very day it must be saved; and she will do anything you tell\nher,\" said his mother. \"She regards you more than anyone else. If you\nwere to ask her again now, I believe she would accept you this very\nday. At any rate, do not let those people have the money.\"\n\nAnd yet he had not spoken to Margaret on the subject during the\njourney, and would now have taken her to the lawyer's chambers\nwithout a word, had she not interrupted him and stopped him.\n\nNevertheless he had been thinking of his uncle, and his uncle's will,\nand his uncle's money, throughout the morning. He was thinking of it\nat that moment when she stopped him--thinking how hard it all was,\nhow cruel that those people in the New Road should have had and spent\nhalf his uncle's fortune, and that now the remainder, which at one\ntime had seemed to be near the reach of his own children, should also\ngo to atone for the negligence and fraud of those wretched Rubbs.\n\nWe all know with how strong a bias we regard our own side of any\nquestion, and he regarded his side in this question with a very\nstrong bias. Nevertheless he had refrained from a word, and would\nhave refrained, had she not stopped him.\n\nWhen she took hold of him by the coat, he looked for a moment into\nher face, and thought that in its trouble it was very sweet. She\nleaned somewhat against him as she spoke, and he wished that she\nwould lean against him altogether. There was about her a quiet\npower of endurance, and at the same time a comeliness and a womanly\nsoftness which seemed to fit her altogether for his wants and\nwishes. As he looked with his dull face across into the square, no\nphysiognomist would have declared of him that at that moment he was\nsuffering from love, or thinking of a woman that was dear to him. But\nit was so with him, and the physiognomist, had one been there, would\nhave been wrong. She had now asked him a question, which he was bound\nto answer in some way:--\"What ought I to do, John?\"\n\nHe turned slowly round and walked with her, away from their\ndestination, round by the south side of the square, and then up along\nthe blank wall on the east side, nearly to the passage into Holborn,\nand back again all round the enclosed space. She, while she was\nspeaking to him and listening to him, hardly remembered where she was\nor whither she was going.\n\n\"I thought,\" said he, in answer to her question, \"that you intended\nto ask Mr Slow's advice?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to do more than tell him what should be done. He is\nnot a friend, you know, John.\"\n\n\"It's customary to ask lawyers their advice on such subjects.\"\n\n\"I'd rather have yours, John. But, in truth, what I want you to say\nis, that I am right in doing this,--right in keeping my promise to my\nbrother, and providing for his children.\"\n\n\"Like most people, Margaret, you want to be advised to follow your\nown counsel.\"\n\n\"God knows that I want to do right, John. I want to do nothing else,\nJohn, but what's right. As to this money, I care but little for it\nfor myself.\"\n\n\"It is your own, and you have a right to enjoy it.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about enjoyment. As to enjoyment, it seems to me\nto be pretty much the same whether a person is rich or poor. I always\nused to hear that money brought care, and I'm sure I've found it so\nsince I had any.\"\n\n\"You've got no children, Margaret.\"\n\n\"No; but there are all those orphans. Am I not bound to look upon\nthem as mine, now that he has gone? If they don't depend on me, whom\nare they to depend on?\"\n\n\"If your mind is made up, Margaret, I have nothing to say against it.\nYou know what my wishes are. They are just the same now as when you\nwere last with us. It isn't only for the money I say this, though,\nof course, that must go a long way with a man circumstanced as I am;\nbut, Margaret, I love you dearly, and if you can make up your mind to\nbe my wife, I would do my best to make you happy.\"\n\n\"I hadn't meant you to talk in that way, John,\" said Margaret.\n\nBut she was not much flurried. She was now so used to these overtures\nthat they did not come to her as much out of the common way. And she\ngave herself none of that personal credit which women are apt to take\nto themselves when they find they are often sought in marriage. She\nlooked upon her lovers as so many men to whom her income would be\nconvenient, and felt herself to be almost under an obligation to\nthem for their willingness to put up with the incumbrance which was\nattached to it.\n\n\"But it's the only way I can talk when you ask me about this,\" said\nhe. Then he paused for a moment before he added, \"How much is it you\nwish to give to your brother's widow?\"\n\n\"Half what I've got left.\"\n\n\"Got left! You haven't lost any of your money have you, Margaret?\"\n\nThen she explained to him the facts as to the loan, and took care\nto explain to him also, very fully, the compensatory fact of the\npurchase by the railway company. \"And my promise to him was made\nafter I had lent it, you know,\" she urged.\n\n\"I do think it ought to be deducted; I do indeed,\" he said. \"I am\nnot speaking on my own behalf now, as for the sake of my children,\nbut simply as a man of business. As for myself, though I do think I\nhave been hardly used in the matter of my uncle's money, I'll try to\nforget it. I'll try at any rate to do without it. When I first knew\nyou, and found--found that I liked you so much, I own that I did have\nhopes. But if it must be, there shall be an end of that. The children\ndon't starve, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh, John!\"\n\n\"As for me, I won't hanker after your money. But, for your own sake,\nMargaret--\"\n\n\"There will be more than enough for me, you know; and, John--\"\n\nShe was going to make him some promise; to tell him something of her\nintention towards his son, and to make some tender of assistance to\nhimself; being now in that mind to live on the smallest possible\npittance, of which I have before spoken, when he ceased speaking or\nlistening, and hurried her on to the attorney's chambers.\n\n\"Do what you like with it. It is your own,\" said he. \"And we shall do\nno good by talking about it any longer out here.\"\n\nSo at last they made their way up to Mr Slow's rooms, on the first\nfloor in the old house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and were informed\nthat that gentleman was at home. Would they be pleased to sit down in\nthe waiting-room?\n\nThere is, I think, no sadder place in the world than the waiting-room\nattached to an attorney's chambers in London. In this instance it was\na three-cornered room, which had got itself wedged in between the\nhouse which fronted to Lincoln's Inn Fields, and some buildings in a\nnarrow lane that ran at the back of the row. There was no carpet in\nit, and hardly any need of one, as the greater part of the floor was\nstrewed with bundles of dusty papers. There was a window in it, which\nlooked out from the point of the further angle against the wall of\nthe opposite building. The dreariness of this aspect had been thought\nto be too much for the minds of those who waited, and therefore the\nbottom panes had been clouded, so that there was in fact no power of\nlooking out at all. Over the fireplace there was a table of descents\nand relationship, showing how heirship went; and the table was very\ncomplicated, describing not only the heirship of ordinary real and\npersonal property, but also explaining the wonderful difficulties of\ngavelkind, and other mysteriously traditional laws. But the table was\nas dirty as it was complicated, and the ordinary waiting reader could\nmake nothing of it. There was a small table in the room, near the\nwindow, which was always covered with loose papers; but these loose\npapers were on this occasion again covered with sheets of parchment,\nand a pale-faced man, of about thirty, whose beard had never yet\nattained power to do more than sprout, was sitting at the table, and\nporing over the parchments. Round the room, on shelves, there was a\nvariety of iron boxes, on which were written the names of Mr Slow's\nclients,--of those clients whose property justified them in having\nspecial boxes of their own. But these boxes were there, it must be\nsupposed, for temporary purposes,--purposes which might be described\nas almost permanently temporary,--for those boxes which were allowed\nto exist in absolute permanence of retirement, were kept in an iron\nroom downstairs, the trap-door into which had yawned upon Miss\nMackenzie as she was shown into the waiting-room. There was, however,\none such box open, on the middle of the floor, and sundry of the\nparchments which had been taken from it were lying around it.\n\nThere were but two chairs in the room besides the one occupied by the\nman at the table, and these were taken by John Ball and his cousin.\nShe sat herself down, armed with patience, indifferent to the delay\nand indifferent to the dusty ugliness of everything around her, as\nwomen are on such occasions. He, thinking much of his time, and\nsomewhat annoyed at being called upon to wait, sat with his chin\nresting on his umbrella between his legs, and as he did so he allowed\nhis eyes to roam around among the names upon the boxes. There was\nnothing on any one of those up on the shelves that attracted him.\nThere was the Marquis of B----, and Sir C. D----, and the Dowager\nCountess of E----. Seeing this, he speculated mildly whether Mr Slow\nput forward the boxes of his aristocratic customers to show how well\nhe was doing in the world. But presently his eye fell from the shelf\nand settled upon the box on the floor. There, on that box, he saw the\nname of Walter Mackenzie.\n\nThis did not astonish him, as he immediately said to himself that\nthese papers were being searched with reference to the business on\nwhich his cousin was there that day; but suddenly it occurred to him\nthat Margaret had given him to understand that Mr Slow did not expect\nher. He stepped over to her, therefore, one step over the papers, and\nasked her the question, whispering it into her ear.\n\n\"No,\" said she, \"I had no appointment. I don't think he expects me.\"\n\nHe returned to his seat, and again sitting down with his chin on\nthe top of his umbrella, surveyed the parchments that lay upon the\nground. Upon one of them, that was not far from his feet, he read the\nouter endorsements written as such endorsements always are, in almost\nillegible old English letters--\n\n\"Jonathan Ball, to John Ball, junior--Deed of Gift.\"\n\nBut, after all, there was nothing more than a coincidence in this.\nOf course Mr Slow would have in his possession all the papers\nappertaining to the transfer of Jonathan Ball's property to the\nMackenzies; or, at any rate, such as referred to Walter's share of\nit. Indeed, Mr Slow, at the time of Jonathan Ball's death, acted for\nthe two brothers, and it was probable that all the papers would be\nwith him. John Ball had known that there had been some intention\non his uncle's part, before the quarrel between his father and his\nuncle, to make over to him, on his coming of age, a certain property\nin London, and he had been told that the money which the Mackenzies\nhad inherited had ultimately come from this very property. His uncle\nhad been an eccentric, quarrelsome man, prone to change his mind\noften, and not regardful of money as far as he himself was concerned.\nJohn Ball remembered to have heard that his uncle had intended him to\nbecome possessed of certain property in his own right the day that\nhe became of age, and that this had all been changed because of the\nquarrel which had taken place between his uncle and his father. His\nfather now never spoke of this, and for many years past had seldom\nmentioned it. But from his mother he had often heard of the special\ninjury which he had undergone.\n\n\"His uncle,\" she had said, \"had given it, and had taken it back\nagain,--had taken it back that he might waste it on those\nMackenzies.\"\n\nAll this he had heard very often, but he had never known anything of\na deed of gift. Was it not singular, he thought, that the draft of\nsuch a deed should be lying at his foot at this moment.\n\nHe showed nothing of this in his face, and still sat there with his\nchin resting on his umbrella. But certainly stronger ideas than usual\nof the great wrongs which he had suffered did come into his head as\nhe looked upon the paper at his feet. He began to wonder whether he\nwould be justified in taking it up and inspecting it. But as he was\nthinking of this the pale-faced man rose from his chair, and after\nmoving among the papers on the ground for an instant, selected this\nvery document, and carried it with him to his table. Mr Ball, as\nhis eyes followed the parchment, watched the young man dust it and\nopen it, and then having flattened it with his hand, glance over it\ntill he came to a certain spot. The pale-faced clerk, accustomed\nto such documents, glanced over the ambages, the \"whereases,\" the\n\"aforesaids,\" the rich exuberance of \"admors.,\" \"exors.,\" and\n\"assigns,\" till he deftly came to the pith of the matter, and then\nhe began to make extracts, a date here and a date there. John Ball\nwatched him all the time, till the door was opened, and old Mr Slow\nhimself appeared in the room.\n\nHe stepped across the papers to shake hands with his client, and then\nshook hands also with Mr Ball, whom he knew. His eye glanced at once\ndown to the box, and after that over towards the pale-faced clerk.\nMr Ball perceived that the attorney had joined in his own mind the\noperation that was going on with these special documents, and the\npresence of these two special visitors; and that he, in some measure,\nregretted the coincidence. There was something wrong, and John Ball\nbegan to consider whether the old lawyer could be an old scoundrel.\nSome lawyers, he knew, were desperate scoundrels. He said nothing,\nhowever; but, obeying Mr Slow's invitation, followed him and his\ncousin into the sanctum sanctorum of the chambers.\n\n\"They didn't tell me you were here at first,\" said the lawyer, in a\ntone of vexation, \"or I wouldn't have had you shown in there.\"\n\nJohn Ball thought that this was, doubtless, true, and that very\nprobably they might not have been put in among those papers had Mr\nSlow known what was being done.\n\n\"The truth is,\" continued the lawyer, \"the Duke of F----'s man of\nbusiness was with me, and they did not like to interrupt me.\"\n\nMr Slow was a grey-haired old man, nearer eighty than seventy,\nwho, with the exception of a fortnight's holiday every year which\nhe always spent at Margate, had attended those same chambers in\nLincoln's Inn Fields daily for the last sixty years. He was a stout,\nthickset man, very leisurely in all his motions, who walked slowly,\ntalked slowly, read slowly, wrote slowly, and thought slowly; but\nwho, nevertheless, had the reputation of doing a great deal of\nbusiness, and doing it very well. He had a partner in the business,\nalmost as old as himself, named Bideawhile; and they who knew them\nboth used to speculate which of the two was the most leisurely. It\nwas, however, generally felt that, though Mr Slow was the slowest in\nhis speech, Mr Bideawhile was the longest in getting anything said.\nMr Slow would often beguile his time with unnecessary remarks; but Mr\nBideawhile was so constant in beguiling his time, that men wondered\nhow, in truth, he ever did anything at all. Of both of them it may be\nsaid that no men stood higher in their profession, and that Mr Ball's\nsuspicions, had they been known in the neighbourhood of Lincoln's\nInn, would have been scouted as utterly baseless. And, for the\ncomfort of my readers, let me assure them that they were utterly\nbaseless. There might, perhaps, have been a little vanity about Mr\nSlow as to the names of his aristocratic clients; but he was an\nhonest, painstaking man, who had ever done his duty well by those who\nhad employed him.\n\nIs it not remarkable that the common repute which we all give to\nattorneys in the general is exactly opposite to that which every man\ngives to his own attorney in particular? Whom does anybody trust so\nimplicitly as he trusts his own attorney? And yet is it not the case\nthat the body of attorneys is supposed to be the most roguish body in\nexistence?\n\nThe old man seemed now to be a little fretful, and said something\nmore about his sorrow at their having been sent into that room.\n\n\"We are so crowded,\" he said, \"that we hardly know how to stir\nourselves.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie said it did not signify in the least. Mr Ball said\nnothing, but seated himself with his chin again resting on his\numbrella.\n\n\"I was so sorry to see in the papers an account of your brother's\ndeath,\" said Mr Slow.\n\n\"Yes, Mr Slow; he has gone, and left a wife and very large family.\"\n\n\"I hope they are provided for, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"No, indeed; they are not provided for at all. My brother had not\nbeen fortunate in business.\"\n\n\"And yet he went into it with a large capital,--with a large capital\nin such a business as that.\"\n\nJohn Ball, with his chin on the umbrella, said nothing. He said\nnothing, but he winced as he thought whence the capital had come. And\nhe thought, too, of those much-meaning words: \"Jonathan Ball to John\nBall, junior--Deed of gift.\"\n\n\"He had been unfortunate,\" said Miss Mackenzie, in an apologetic\ntone.\n\n\"And what will you do about your loan?\" said Mr Slow, looking over\nto John Ball when he asked the question, as though inquiring whether\nall Miss Mackenzie's affairs were to be talked over openly in the\npresence of that gentleman.\n\n\"That was a gift,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"A deed of gift,\" thought John Ball to himself. \"A deed of gift!\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! Then there's an end of that, I suppose,\" said Mr Slow.\n\n\"Exactly so. I have been explaining to my cousin all about it. I hope\nthe firm will be able to pay my sister-in-law the interest on it, but\nthat does not seem sure.\"\n\n\"I am afraid I cannot help you there, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"Of course not. I was not thinking of it. But what I've come about is\nthis.\" Then she told Mr Slow the whole of her project with reference\nto her fortune; how, on his death-bed, she had promised to give half\nof all that she had to her brother's wife and family, and how she had\ncome there to him, with her cousin, in order that he might put her in\nthe way of keeping her promise.\n\nMr Slow sat in silence and patiently heard her to the end. She,\nfinding herself thus encouraged to speak, expatiated on the solemnity\nof her promise, and declared that she could not be comfortable till\nshe had done all that she had undertaken to perform. \"And I shall\nhave quite enough for myself afterwards, Mr Slow, quite enough.\"\n\nMr Slow did not say a word till she had done, and even then he\nseemed to delay his speech. John Ball never raised his face from his\numbrella, but sat looking at the lawyer, whom he still suspected of\nroguery. And if the lawyer were a rogue, what then about his cousin?\nIt must not be supposed that he suspected her; but what would come of\nher, if the fortune she held were, in truth, not her own?\n\n\"I have told my cousin all about it,\" continued Margaret, \"and I\nbelieve that he thinks I am doing right. At any rate, I would do\nnothing without his knowing it.\"\n\n\"I think she is giving her sister-in-law too much,\" said John Ball.\n\n\"I am only doing what I promised,\" urged Margaret.\n\n\"I think that the money which she lent to the firm should, at any\nrate, be deducted,\" said John Ball, speaking this with a kind of\nproviso to himself, that the words so spoken were intended to be\ntaken as having any meaning only on the presumption that that\ndocument which he had seen in the other room should turn out to be\nwholly inoperative and inefficient at the present moment. In answer\nto these side-questions or corollary points as to the deduction or\nnon-deduction of the loan, Mr Slow answered not a word; but when\nthere was silence between them, he did make answer as to the original\nproposition.\n\n\"Miss Mackenzie,\" he said, \"I think you had better postpone doing\nanything in this matter for the present.\"\n\n\"Why postpone it?\" said she.\n\n\"Your brother's death is very recent. It happened not above a\nfortnight since, I think.\"\n\n\"And I want to have this settled at once, so that there shall be no\ndistress. What's the good of waiting?\"\n\n\"Such things want thinking of, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"But I have thought of it. All I want now is to have it done.\"\n\nA slight smile came across the puckered grey face of the lawyer as he\nfelt the imperative nature of the instruction given to him. The lady\nhad come there not to be advised, but to have her work done for her\nout of hand. But the smile was very melancholy, and soon passed away.\n\n\"Is the widow in immediate distress?\" asked Mr Slow.\n\nNow the fact was that Miss Mackenzie herself had been in good funds,\nhaving had ready money in her hands from the time of her brother\nWalter's death; and for the last year she had by no means spent her\nfull income. She had, therefore, given her sister-in-law money, and\nhad paid the small debts which had come in, as such small debts will\ncome in, directly the dead man's body was under ground. Nay, some had\ncome in and had been paid while the man was yet dying. She exclaimed,\ntherefore, that her sister-in-law was not absolutely in immediate\nwant.\n\n\"And does she keep the house?\" asked the lawyer.\n\nThen Miss Mackenzie explained that Mrs Tom intended, if possible, to\nkeep the house, and to take some lady in to lodge with her.\n\n\"Then there cannot be any immediate hurry,\" urged the lawyer; \"and\nas the sum of money in question is large, I really think the matter\nshould be considered.\"\n\nBut Miss Mackenzie still pressed it. She was very anxious to make him\nunderstand--and of course he did understand at once--that she had\nno wish to hurry him in his work. All that she required of him was\nan assurance that he accepted her instructions, and that the thing\nshould be done with not more than the ordinary amount of legal delay.\n\n\"You can pay her what you like out of your own income,\" said the\nlawyer.\n\n\"But that is not what I promised,\" said Margaret Mackenzie.\n\nThen there was silence among them all. Mr Ball had said very little\nsince he had been sitting in that room, and now it was not he who\nbroke the silence. He was still thinking of that deed of gift, and\nwondering whether it had anything to do with Mr Slow's unwillingness\nto undertake the commission which Margaret wished to give him. At\nlast Mr Slow got up from his chair, and spoke as follows:\n\n\"Mr Ball, I hope you will excuse me; but I have a word or two to say\nto Miss Mackenzie, which I had rather say to her alone.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Mr Ball, rising and preparing to go.\n\n\"You will wait for me, John,\" said Miss Mackenzie, asking this favour\nof him as though she were very anxious that he should grant it.\n\nMr Slow said that he might be closeted with Miss Mackenzie for some\nlittle time, perhaps for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. John\nBall looked at his watch, and then at his cousin's face, and then\npromised that he would wait. Mr Slow himself took him into the outer\noffice, and then handed him a chair; but he observed that he was not\nallowed to go back into the waiting-room.\n\nThere he waited for three-quarters of an hour, constantly looking at\nhis watch, and thinking more and more about that deed of gift. Surely\nit must be the case that the document which he had seen had some\nreference to this great delay. At last he heard a door open, and a\nstep along a passage, and then another door was opened, and Mr Slow\nreappeared with Margaret Mackenzie behind him. John Ball's eyes\nimmediately fell on his cousin's face, and he could see that it was\nvery pale. The lawyer's wore that smile which men put on when they\nwish to cover the disagreeable seriousness of the moment.\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Mackenzie,\" said he, pressing his client's hand.\n\n\"Good morning, sir,\" said she.\n\nThe lawyer and Mr Ball then touched each other's hands, and the\nformer followed his cousin down the steps out into the square.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTribulation\n\n\nWhen they were once more out in the square, side by side, Miss\nMackenzie took hold of her cousin's arm and walked on for a few steps\nin silence, in the direction of Great Queen Street--that is to say,\naway from the city, towards which she knew her cousin would go in\npursuit of his own business. And indeed the hour was now close at\nhand in which he should be sitting as a director at the Shadrach\nFire Assurance Office. If not at the Shadrach by two, or, with all\npossible allowance for the shortcoming of a generally punctual\ndirector, by a quarter past two, he would be too late for his guinea;\nand now, as he looked at his watch, it wanted only ten minutes to\ntwo. He was very particular about these guineas, and the chambers of\nthe Shadrach were away in Old Broad Street. Nevertheless he walked on\nwith her.\n\n\"John,\" she said, when they had walked half the length of that side\nof the square, \"I have heard dreadful news.\"\n\nThen that deed of gift was, after all, a fact; and Mr Slow, instead\nof being a rogue, must be the honestest old lawyer in London! He must\nhave been at work in discovering the wrong that had been done, and\nwas now about to reveal it to the world. Some such idea as this had\nglimmered across Mr Ball's mind as he had sat in Mr Slow's outer\noffice, with his chin still resting on his umbrella.\n\nBut though some such idea as this did cross his mind, his thought on\nthe instant was of his cousin.\n\n\"What dreadful news, Margaret?\"\n\n\"It is about my money.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment, Margaret. Are you sure that you ought to tell it to\nme?\"\n\n\"If I don't, to whom shall I tell it? And how can I bear it without\ntelling it to some one?\"\n\n\"Did Mr Slow bid you speak of it to me?\"\n\n\"No; he bade me think much of it before I did so, as you are\nconcerned. And he said that you might perhaps be disappointed.\"\n\nThen they walked on again in silence. John Ball found his position\nto be very difficult, and hardly knew how to speak to her, or how to\ncarry himself. If it was to be that this money was to come back to\nhim; if it was his now in spite of all that had come and gone; if the\nwrong done was to be righted, and the property wrested from him was\nto be restored,--restored to him who wanted it so sorely,--how could\nhe not triumph in such an act of tardy restitution? He remembered all\nthe particulars at this moment. Twelve thousand pounds of his uncle\nJonathan's money had gone to Walter Mackenzie. The sum once intended\nfor him had been much more than that,--more he believed than double\nthat; but if twelve thousand pounds was now restored to him, how\ndifferent would it make the whole tenor of his life; Mr Slow said\nthat he might be disappointed; but then Mr Slow was not his lawyer.\nDid he not owe it to his family immediately to go to his own\nattorney? Now he thought no more of his guinea at the Shadrach, but\nwalked on by his cousin's side with his mind intently fixed on his\nuncle's money. She was still leaning on his arm.\n\n\"Tell me, John, what shall I do?\" said she, looking up into his face.\n\nWould it not be better for them, better for the interests of them\nboth, that they should be separated? Was it probable, or possible,\nthat with interests so adverse, they should give each other good\nadvice? Did it not behove him to explain to her that till this should\nbe settled between them, they must necessarily regard each other as\nenemies? For a moment or two he wished himself away from her, and was\ncalculating how he might escape. But then, when he looked down at\nher, and saw the softness of her eye, and felt the confidence implied\nin the weight of her hand upon his arm, his hard heart was softened,\nand he relented.\n\n\"It is difficult to tell you what you should do,\" he said. \"At\npresent nothing seems to be known. He has said nothing for certain.\"\n\n\"But I could understand him,\" she said, in reply; \"I could see by\nhis face, and I knew by the tone of his voice, that he was almost\ncertain. I know that he is sure of it. John, I shall be a beggar, an\nabsolute beggar! I shall have nothing; and those poor children will\nbe beggars, and their mother. I feel as though I did not know where I\nam, or what I am doing.\"\n\nThen an idea came into his head. If this money was not hers, it was\nhis. If it was not his, then it was hers. Would it not be well that\nthey should solve all the difficulty by agreeing then and there to be\nman and wife? It was true that since his Rachel's death he had seen\nno woman whom he so much coveted to have in his home as this one who\nnow leaned on his arm. But, as he thought of it, there seemed to be\na romance about such a step which would not befit him. What would\nhis mother and father say to him if, after all his troubles, he was\nat last to marry a woman without a farthing? And then, too, would\nshe consent to give up all further consideration for her brother's\nfamily? Would she agree to abandon her idea of assisting them, if\nultimately it should turn out that the property was hers? No; there\nwas certainly a looseness about such a plan which did not befit him;\nand, moreover, were he to attempt it, he would probably not succeed.\n\nBut something must be done, now at this moment. The guinea at the\nShadrach was gone for ever, and therefore he could devote himself for\nthe day to his cousin.\n\n\"Are you to hear again from Mr Slow?\" he said.\n\n\"I am to go to him this day week.\"\n\n\"And then it will be decided?\"\n\n\"John, it is decided now; I am sure of it. I feel that it is all\ngone. A careful man like that would never have spoken as he did,\nunless he was sure. It will be all yours, John.\"\n\n\"So would have been that which your brother had,\" said he.\n\n\"I suppose so. It is dreadful to think of; very dreadful. I can only\npromise that I will spend nothing till it is decided. John, I wish\nyou would take from me what I have, lest it should go.\" And she\nabsolutely had her hand upon her purse in her pocket.\n\n\"No,\" said he slowly, \"no; you need think of nothing of that sort.\"\n\n\"But what am I to do? Where am I to go while this week passes by?\"\n\n\"You will stay where you are, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh John! if you could understand! How am I to look my aunt in the\nface. Don't you know that she would not wish to have me there at all\nif I was a poor creature without anything?\" The poor creature did not\nknow herself how terribly heavy was the accusation she was bringing\nagainst her aunt. \"And what will she say when she knows that the\nmoney I have spent has never really been my own?\"\n\nThen he counselled her to say nothing about it to her aunt till after\nher next visit to Mr Slow's and made her understand that he, himself,\nwould not mention the subject at the Cedars till the week was passed.\nHe should go, he said, to his own lawyer, and tell him the whole\nstory as far as he knew it. It was not that he in the least doubted\nMr Slow's honesty or judgment, but it would be better that the two\nshould act together. Then when the week was over, he and Margaret\nwould once more go to Lincoln's Inn Fields.\n\n\"What a week I shall have!\" said she.\n\n\"It will be a nervous time for us both,\" he answered.\n\n\"And what must I do after that?\" This question she asked, not in the\nleast as desirous of obtaining from him any assurance of assistance,\nbut in the agony of her spirit, and in sheer dismay as to her\nprospects.\n\n\"We must hope for the best,\" he said. \"God tempers the wind to the\nshorn lamb.\" He had often thought of the way in which he had been\nshorn, but he did not, at this moment, remember that the shearing had\nnever been so tempered as to be acceptable to his own feelings.\n\n\"And in God only can I trust,\" she answered. As she said this, her\nmind went away to Littlebath, and the Stumfoldians, and Mr Maguire.\nWas there not great mercy in the fact, that this ruin had not found\nher married to that unfortunate clergyman? And what would they all\nsay at Littlebath when they heard the story? How would Mrs Stumfold\nexult over the downfall of the woman who had rebelled against her!\nhow would the nose of the coachmaker's wife rise in the air! and how\nwould Mr Maguire rejoice that this great calamity had not fallen upon\nhim! Margaret Mackenzie's heart and spirit had been sullied by no\nmean feeling with reference to her own wealth. It had never puffed\nher up with exultation. But she calculated on the meanness of others,\nas though it was a matter of course, not, indeed, knowing that it was\nmeanness, or blaming them in any way for that which she attributed to\nthem. Four gentlemen had wished to marry her during the past year. It\nnever occurred to her now, that any one of these four would on that\naccount hold out a hand to help her. In losing her money she would\nhave lost all that was desirable in their eyes, and this seemed to\nher to be natural.\n\nThey were still walking round Lincoln's Inn Fields. \"John,\" she\nexclaimed suddenly, \"I must go to them in Gower Street.\"\n\n\"What, now, to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes, now, immediately. You need not mind me; I can get back to\nTwickenham by myself. I know the trains.\"\n\n\"If I were you, Margaret, I would not go till all this is decided.\"\n\n\"It is decided, John; I know it is. And how can I leave them in such\na condition, spending money which they will never get? They must know\nit some time, and the sooner the better. Mr Rubb must know it too. He\nmust understand that he is more than ever bound to provide them with\nan income out of the business.\"\n\n\"I would not do it to-day if I were you.\"\n\n\"But I must, John; this very day. If I am not home by dinner, tell\nthem that I had to go to Gower Street. I shall at any rate be there\nin the evening. Do not you mind coming back with me.\"\n\nThey were then at the gate leading into the New Square, and she\nturned abruptly round, and hurried away from him up into Holborn,\npassing very near to Mr Slow's chambers. John Ball did not attempt\nto follow her, but stood there awhile looking after her. He felt,\nin his heart, and knew by his judgment, that she was a good woman,\ntrue, unselfish, full of love, clever too in her way, quick in\napprehension, and endowed with an admirable courage. He had heard her\nspoken of at the Cedars as a poor creature who had money. Nay, he\nhimself had taken a part in so speaking of her. Now she had no money,\nbut he knew well that she was a creature the very reverse of poor.\nWhat should he do for her? In what way should he himself behave\ntowards her? In the early days of his youth, before the cares of the\nworld had made him hard, he had married his Rachel without a penny,\nand his father had laughed at him, and his mother had grieved over\nhim. Tough and hard, and careworn as he was now, defiled by the price\nof stocks, and saturated with the poison of the money market, then\nthere had been in him a touch of romance and a dash of poetry, and\nhe had been happy with his Rachel. Should he try it again now? The\nwoman would surely love him when she found that he came to her in her\npoverty as he had before come to her in her wealth. He watched her\ntill she passed out of his sight along the wall leading to Holborn,\nand then he made his way to the City through Lincoln's Inn and\nChancery Lane.\n\nMargaret walked straight into Holborn, and over it towards Red Lion\nSquare. She crossed the line of the omnibuses, feeling that now she\nmust spend no penny which she could save. She was tired, for she had\nalready walked much that morning, and the day was close and hot;\nbut nevertheless she went on quickly, through Bloomsbury Square and\nRussell Square, to Gower Street. As she got near to the door her\nheart almost failed her; but she went up to it and knocked boldly.\nThe thing should be done, let the pain of doing it be what it might.\n\n\"Laws, Miss Margaret! is that you?\" said the maid. \"Yes, missus is\nat home. She'll see you, of course, but she's hard at work on the\nfurniture.\"\n\nThen she went directly up into the drawing-room and there she found\nher sister-in-law, with her dress tucked up to her elbows, with a\ncloth in her hand, rubbing the chairs.\n\n\"What, Margaret! Whoever expected to see you? If we are to let the\nrooms, it's as well to have the things tidy, isn't it? Besides, a\nperson bears it all the better when there's anything to do.\"\n\nThen Mary Jane, the eldest daughter, came in from the bedroom behind\nthe drawing-room, similarly armed for work.\n\nMargaret sat down wearily upon the sofa, having muttered some word\nin answer to Mrs Tom's apology for having been found at work so soon\nafter her husband's death.\n\n\"Sarah,\" she said, \"I have come to you to-day because I had something\nto say to you about business.\"\n\n\"Oh, to be sure! I never thought for a moment you had come for\npleasure, or out of civility, as it might be. Of course I didn't\nexpect that when I saw you.\"\n\n\"Sarah, will you come upstairs with me into your own room?\"\n\n\"Upstairs, Margaret? Oh yes, if you please. We shall be down\ndirectly, my dear, and I dare say Margaret will stay to tea. We tea\nearly, because, since you went, we have dined at one.\"\n\nThen Mrs Tom led the way up to the room in which Margaret had watched\nby her dying brother's bed-side.\n\n\"I'm come in here,\" said Mrs Tom, again apologising, \"because the\nchildren had to come out of the room behind the drawing-room. Miss\nColza is staying with us, and she and Mary Jane have your room.\"\n\nMargaret did not care much for all this; but the solemnity of the\nchamber in which, when she last saw it, her brother's body was lying,\nadded something to her sadness at the moment.\n\n\"Sarah,\" she said, endeavouring to warn her sister-in-law by the tone\nof her voice that her news was bad news, \"I have just come from Mr\nSlow.\"\n\n\"He's the lawyer, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, he's the lawyer. You know what I promised my brother. I went to\nhim to make arrangements for doing it, and when there I heard--oh,\nSarah, such dreadful news!\"\n\n\"He says you're not to do it, I suppose!\" And in the woman's voice\nand eyes there were signs of anger, not against Mr Slow alone, but\nalso against Miss Mackenzie. \"I knew how it would be. But, Margaret,\nMr Slow has got nothing to do with it. A promise is a promise; and a\npromise made to a dying man! Oh, Margaret!\"\n\n\"If I had it to give I would give it as surely as I am standing here.\nWhen I told my brother it should be so, he believed me at once.\"\n\n\"Of course he believed you.\"\n\n\"But Sarah, they tell me now that I have nothing to give.\"\n\n\"Who tells you so?\"\n\n\"The lawyer. I cannot explain it all to you; indeed, I do not as\nyet understand it myself; but I have learned this morning that the\nproperty which Walter left me was not his to leave. It had been given\naway before Mr Jonathan Ball died.\"\n\n\"It's a lie!\" said the injured woman,--the woman who was the least\ninjured, but who, with her children, had perhaps the best excuse for\nbeing ill able to bear the injury. \"It must be a lie. It's more than\ntwenty years ago. I don't believe and won't believe that it can be\nso. John Ball must have something to do with this.\"\n\n\"The property will go to him, but he has had nothing to do with it.\nMr Slow found it out.\"\n\n\"It can't be so, not after twenty years. Whatever they may have done\nfrom Walter, they can't take it away from you; not if you've spirit\nenough to stand up for your rights. If you let them take it in that\nway, I can't tell you what I shall think of you.\"\n\n\"It is my own lawyer that says so.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr Slow; the biggest rogue of them all. I always knew that of\nhim, always. Oh, Margaret, think of the children! What are we to do?\nWhat are we to do?\" And sitting down on the bedside, she put her\ndirty apron up to her eyes.\n\n\"I have been thinking of them ever since I heard it,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"But what good will thinking do? You must do something. Oh! Margaret,\nafter all that you said to him when he lay there dying!\" and the\nwoman, with some approach to true pathos, put her hand on the spot\nwhere her husband's head had rested. \"Don't let his children come\nto beggary because men like that choose to rob the widow and the\norphan.\"\n\n\"Every one has a right to what is his own,\" said Margaret. \"Even\nthough widows should be beggars, and orphans should want.\"\n\n\"That's very well of you, Margaret. It's very well for you to say\nthat, who have friends like the Balls to stand by you. And, perhaps,\nif you will let him have it all without saying anything, he will\nstand by you firmer than ever. But who is there to stand by me and\nmy children? It can't be that after twenty years your fortune should\nbelong to anyone else. Why should it have gone on for more than\ntwenty years, and nobody have found it out? I don't believe it can\ncome so, Margaret, unless you choose to let them do it. I don't\nbelieve a word of it.\"\n\nThere was nothing more to be said upon that subject at present. Mrs\nTom did indeed say a great deal more about it, sometimes threatening\nMargaret, and sometimes imploring her; but Miss Mackenzie herself\nwould not allow herself to speak of the thing otherwise than as an\nascertained fact. Had the other woman been more reasonable or less\npassionate in her lamentations Miss Mackenzie might have trusted\nherself to tell her that there was yet a doubt. But she herself felt\nthat the doubt was so small, and that, in Mrs Tom's mind, it would\nbe so magnified into nearly a certainty on the other side, that\nshe thought it most discreet not to refer to the exact amount of\ninformation which Mr Slow had given to her.\n\n\"It will be best for us to think, Sarah,\" she said, trying to turn\nthe other's mind away from the coveted income which she would never\npossess--\"to think what you and the children had better do.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!\"\n\n\"It is very bad; but there is always something to be done. We must\nlose no time in letting Mr Rubb know the truth. When he hears how it\nis, he will understand that something must be done for you out of the\nfirm.\"\n\n\"He won't do anything. He's downstairs now, flirting with that girl\nin the drawing-room, instead of being at his business.\"\n\n\"If he's downstairs, I will see him.\"\n\nAs Mrs Mackenzie made no objection to this, Margaret went downstairs,\nand when she came near the passage at the bottom, she heard the\nvoices of people talking merrily in the parlour. As her hand was\non the lock of the door, words from Miss Colza became very audible.\n\"Now, Mr Rubb, be quiet.\" So she knocked at the door, and having been\ninvited by Mr Rubb to come in, she opened it.\n\nIt may be presumed that the flirting had not gone to any perilous\nextent, as there were three or four children present. Nevertheless\nMiss Colza and Mr Rubb were somewhat disconcerted, and expressed\ntheir surprise at seeing Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"We all thought you were staying with the baronet's lady,\" said Miss\nColza.\n\nMiss Mackenzie explained that she was staying at Twickenham, but that\nshe had come up to pay a visit to her sister-in-law. \"And I've a word\nor two I want to say to you, Mr Rubb, if you'll allow me.\"\n\n\"I suppose, then, I'd better make myself scarce,\" said Miss Colza.\n\nAs she was not asked to stay, she did make herself scarce, taking the\nchildren with her up among the tables and chairs in the drawing-room.\nThere she found Mary Jane, but she did not find Mrs Mackenzie, who\nhad thrown herself on the bed in her agony upstairs.\n\nThen Miss Mackenzie told her wretched story to Mr Rubb,--telling it\nfor the third time. He was awe-struck as he listened, but did not\nonce attempt to deny the facts, as had been done by Mrs Mackenzie.\n\n\"And is it sure?\" he asked, when her story was over.\n\n\"I don't suppose it is quite sure yet. Indeed, Mr Slow said it was\nnot quite sure. But I have not allowed myself to doubt it, and I do\nnot doubt it.\"\n\n\"If he himself had not felt himself sure, he would not have told\nyou.\"\n\n\"Just so, Mr Rubb. That is what I think; and therefore I have given\nmy sister-in-law no hint that there is a chance left. I think you had\nbetter not do so either.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" said he. He spoke in a low voice, almost whispering,\nas though he were half scared by the tidings he had heard.\n\n\"It is very dreadful,\" she said; \"very dreadful for Sarah and the\nchildren.\"\n\n\"And for you too, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"But about them, Mr Rubb. What can you do for them out of the\nbusiness?\"\n\nHe looked very blank, and made no immediate answer.\n\n\"I know you will feel for their position,\" she said. \"You do; do you\nnot?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"And you will do what you can. You can at any rate ensure them the\ninterest of the money--of the money you know that came from me.\"\n\nStill Mr Rubb sat in silence, and she thought that he must be\nstonyhearted. Surely he might undertake to do that, knowing, as he so\nwell knew, the way in which the money had been obtained, and knowing\nalso that he had already said that so much should be forthcoming out\nof the firm to make up a general income for the family of his late\npartner.\n\n\"Surely there will be no doubt about that, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"The Balls will claim the debt,\" said he hoarsely; and then, in\nanswer to her inquiries, he explained that the sum she had lent\nhad not, in truth, been hers to lend. It had formed part of the\nmoney that John Ball could claim, and Mr Slow held in his hands an\nacknowledgement of the debt from Rubb and Mackenzie. Of course, Mr\nBall would claim that the interest should be paid to him; and he\nwould claim the principal too, if, on inquiry, he should find that\nthe firm would be able to raise it. \"I don't know that he wouldn't be\nable to come upon the firm for the money your brother put into the\nbusiness,\" said he gloomily. \"But I don't think he'll be such a fool\nas that. He'd get nothing by it.\"\n\n\"Then may God help them!\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"And what will you do?\" he asked.\n\nShe shook her head, but made him no answer. As for herself she had\nnot begun to form a plan. Her own condition did not seem to her to be\nnearly so dreadful as that of all these young children.\n\n\"I wish I knew how to help you,\" said Samuel Rubb.\n\n\"There are some positions, Mr Rubb, in which no one but God can\nhelp one. But, perhaps--perhaps you may still do something for the\nchildren.\"\n\n\"I will try, Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\n\"Thank you, and may God bless you; and He will bless you if you try.\n'Who giveth a drop of water to one of them in my name, giveth it also\nto me.' You will think of that, will you not?\"\n\n\"I will think of you, and do the best that I can.\"\n\n\"I had hoped to have made them so comfortable! But God's will be\ndone; God's will be done. I think I had better go now, Mr Rubb. There\nwill be no use in my going to her upstairs again. Tell her from me,\nwith my love, that she shall hear from me when I have seen the\nlawyer. I will try to come to her, but perhaps I may not be able.\nGood-bye, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Miss Mackenzie. I hope we shall see each other sometimes.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so. Do what you can to support her. She will want all that\nher friends can do for her.\" So saying she went out of the room, and\nlet herself out of the front door into the street, and began her walk\nback to the Waterloo Station.\n\nShe had not broken bread in her sister-in-law's house, and it was now\nnearly six o'clock. She had taken nothing since she had breakfasted\nat Twickenham, and the affairs of the day had been such as to give\nher but little time to think of such wants. But now as she made her\nweary way through the streets she became sick with hunger, and went\ninto a baker's shop for a bun. As she ate it she felt that it was\nalmost wrong in her to buy even that. At the present moment nothing\nthat she possessed seemed to her to be, by right, her own. Every\nshilling in her purse was the property of John Ball, if Mr Slow's\nstatement were true. Then, when the bun was finished, as she went\ndown by Bloomsbury church and the region of St Giles's back to the\nStrand, she did begin to think of her own position. What should she\ndo, and how should she commence to do it? She had declared to herself\nbut lately that the work for which she was fittest was that of\nnursing the sick. Was it not possible that she might earn her bread\nin this way? Could she not find such employment in some quarter where\nher labour would be worth the food she must eat and the raiment she\nwould require? There was a hospital somewhere in London with which\nshe thought she had heard that John Ball was connected. Might not he\nobtain for her a situation such as that?\n\nIt was past eight when she reached the Cedars, and then she was very\ntired,--very tired and nearly sick also with want. She went first\nof all up to her room, and then crept down into the drawing-room,\nknowing that she should find them at tea. When she entered there was\na large party round the table, consisting of the girls and children\nand Lady Ball. John Ball, who never took tea, was sitting in his\naccustomed place near the lamp, and the old baronet was half asleep\nin his arm-chair.\n\n\"If you were going to dine in Gower Street, Margaret, why didn't you\nsay so?\" said Lady Ball.\n\nIn answer to this, Margaret burst out into tears. It was not the\nunkindness of her aunt's voice that upset her so much as her own\nweakness, and the terrible struggle of the long day.\n\n\"What on earth is the matter?\" said Sir John.\n\nOne of the girls brought her a cup of tea, but she felt herself to be\ntoo weak to take it in her hand, and made a sign that it should be\nput on the table. She was not aware that she had ever fainted, but a\nfear came upon her that she might do so now. She rallied herself and\nstruggled, striving to collect her strength.\n\n\"Do you know what is the matter with her, John?\" said Lady Ball.\n\nThen John Ball asked her if she had had dinner, and when she did not\nanswer him he saw how it was.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, \"she has had no food all day; I will get it for\nher.\"\n\n\"If she wants anything, the servants can bring it to her, John,\" said\nthe mother.\n\nBut he would not trust the servants in this matter, but went out\nhimself and fetched her meat and wine, and pressed her to take it,\nand sat himself beside her, and spoke kind words into her ear, and at\nlast, in some sort, she was comforted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nShowing How Two of Miss Mackenzie's Lovers Behaved\n\n\nMr Ball, on his return home to the Cedars, had given no definite\nanswer to his mother's inquiries as to the day's work in London, and\nhad found it difficult to make any reply to her that would for the\nmoment suffice. She was not a woman easily satisfied with evasive\nanswers; but, nevertheless, he told her nothing of what had occurred,\nand left her simply in a bad humour. This conversation had taken\nplace before dinner, but after dinner she asked him another question.\n\n\"John, you might as well tell me this; are you engaged to Margaret\nMackenzie?\"\n\n\"No, I am not,\" said her son, angrily.\n\nAfter that his mother's humour had become worse than before, and in\nthat state her niece had found her when she returned home in the\nevening, and had suffered in consequence.\n\nOn the next morning Miss Mackenzie sent down word to say she was\nnot well, and would not come down to breakfast. It so happened that\nJohn Ball was going into town on this day also, the Abednego Life\nOffice holding its board day immediately after that of the Shadrach\nFire Office, and therefore he was not able to see her before she\nencountered his mother. Lady Ball went up to her in her bedroom\nimmediately after breakfast, and there remained with her for some\ntime. Her aunt at first was tender with her, giving her tea and only\nasking her gentle little questions at intervals; but as the old\nlady became impatient at learning nothing, she began a system of\ncross-questions, and at last grew to be angry and disagreeable. Her\nson had distinctly told her that he was not engaged to his cousin,\nand had in fact told her nothing else distinctly; but she, when\nshe had seen how careful he had been in supplying Margaret's wants\nhimself, with what anxious solicitude he had pressed wine on her;\nhow he had sat by her saying soft words to her--Lady Ball, when she\nremembered this, could not but think that her son had deceived her.\nAnd if so, why had he wished to deceive her? Could it be that he had\nallowed her to give away half her money, and had promised to marry\nher with the other half? There were moments in which her dear son\nJohn could be very foolish, in spite of that life-long devotion\nto the price of stocks, for which he was conspicuous. She still\nremembered, as though it were but the other day, how he had persisted\nin marrying Rachel, though Rachel brought nothing with her but a\nsweet face, a light figure, a happy temper, and the clothes on her\nback. To all mothers their sons are ever young, and to old Lady Ball\nJohn Ball was still young, and still, possibly, capable of some such\nfolly as that of which she was thinking. If it were not so, if there\nwere not something of that kind in the wind why should he--why should\nshe--be so hard and uncommunicative in all their answers? There lay\nher niece, however, sick with the headache, and therefore weak, and\nvery much in Lady Ball's power. The evil to be done was great, and\nthe necessity for preventing it might be immediate. And Lady Ball\nwas a lady who did not like to be kept in the dark in reference to\nanything concerning her family. Having gone downstairs, therefore,\nfor an hour or so to look after her servants, or, as she had said,\nto allow Margaret to have a little sleep, she returned again to the\ncharge, and sitting close to Margaret's pillow, did her best to find\nout the truth.\n\nIf she could only have known the whole truth; how her son's thoughts\nwere running throughout the day, even as he sat at the Abednego\nboard, not on Margaret with half her fortune, but on Margaret with\nnone! how he was recalling the sweetness of her face as she looked up\nto him in the square, and took him by his coat, and her tears as she\nspoke of the orphan children, and the grace of her figure as she had\nwalked away from him, and the persistency of her courage in doing\nwhat she thought to be right! how he was struggling within himself\nwith an endeavour, a vain endeavour, at a resolution that such a\nmarriage as that must be out of the question! Had Lady Ball known all\nthat, I think she would have flown to the offices of the Abednego\nafter her son, and never have left him till she had conquered his\nheart and trampled his folly under her feet.\n\nBut she did not conquer Margaret Mackenzie. The poor creature lying\nthere, racked, in truth, with pain and sorrow, altogether incapable\nof any escape from her aunt's gripe, would not say a word that might\ntend to ease Lady Ball's mind. If she had told all that she knew, all\nthat she surmised, how would her aunt have rejoiced? That the money\nshould come without the wife would indeed have been a triumph! And\nMargaret in telling all would have had nothing to tell of those\nterribly foolish thoughts which were then at work in the City. To her\nsuch a state of things as that which I have hinted would have seemed\nquite as improbable, quite as unaccountable, as it would have done\nto her aunt. But she did not tell all, nor in truth did she tell\nanything.\n\n\"And John was with you at the lawyer's,\" said Lady Ball, attempting\nher cross-examination for the third time. \"Yes; he was with me\nthere.\"\n\n\"And what did he say when you asked Mr Slow to make such a settlement\nas that?\"\n\n\"He didn't say anything, aunt. The whole thing was put off.\"\n\n\"I know it was put off; of course it was put off. I didn't suppose\nany respectable lawyer in London would have dreamed of doing such a\nthing. But what I want to know is, how it was put off. What did Mr\nSlow say?\"\n\n\"I am to see him again next week.\"\n\n\"But not to get him to do anything of that kind?\"\n\n\"I can't tell, aunt, what he is to do then.\"\n\n\"But what did he say when you made such a proposition as that? Did he\nnot tell you that it was quite out of the question?\"\n\n\"I don't think he said that, aunt.\"\n\n\"Then what did he say? Margaret, I never saw such a person as you\nare. Why should you be so mysterious? There can't be anything you\ndon't want me to know, seeing how very much I am concerned; and I do\nthink you ought to tell me all that occurred, knowing, as you do,\nthat I have done my very best to be kind to you.\"\n\n\"Indeed there isn't anything I can tell--not yet.\"\n\nThen Lady Ball remained silent at the bed-head for the space,\nperhaps, of ten minutes, meditating over it all. If her son was, in\ntruth, engaged to this woman, at any rate she would find that out. If\nshe asked a point-blank question on that subject, Margaret would not\nbe able to leave it unanswered, and would hardly be able to give a\ndirectly false answer.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said, \"I think you will not refuse to tell me plainly\nwhether there is anything between you and John. As his mother, I have\na right to know?\"\n\n\"How anything between us?\" said Margaret, raising herself on her\nelbow.\n\n\"Are you engaged to marry him?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! no.\"\n\n\"And there is nothing of that sort going on?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"You are determined still to refuse him?\"\n\n\"It is quite out of the question, aunt. He does not wish it at all.\nYou may be sure that he has quite changed his mind about it.\"\n\n\"But he won't have changed his mind if you have given up your plan\nabout your sister-in-law.\"\n\n\"He has changed it altogether, aunt. You needn't think anything more\nabout that. He thinks no more about it.\"\n\nNevertheless he was thinking about it this very moment, as he voted\nfor accepting a doubtful life at the Abednego, which was urged on the\nboard by a director, who, I hope, had no intimate personal relations\nwith the owner of the doubtful life in question.\n\nLady Ball did not know what to make of it. For many years past she\nhad not seen her son carry himself so much like a lover as he had\ndone when he sat himself beside his cousin pressing her to drink\nher glass of sherry. Why was he so anxious for her comfort? And why,\nbefore that, had he been so studiously reticent as to her affairs?\n\n\"I can't make anything out of you,\" said Lady Ball, getting up from\nher chair with angry alacrity; \"and I must say that I think it very\nungrateful of you, seeing all that I have done for you.\"\n\nSo saying, she left the room.\n\nWhat, oh, what would she think when she should come to know the\ntruth? Margaret told herself as she lay there, holding her head\nbetween her hands, that she was even now occupying that room and\nenjoying the questionable comfort of that bed under false pretences.\nWhen it was known that she was absolutely a pauper, would she then\nbe made welcome to her uncle's house? She was now remaining there\nwithout divulging her circumstances, under the advice and by the\nauthority of her cousin; and she had resolved to be guided by him in\nall things as long as he would be at the trouble to guide her. On\nwhom else could she depend? But, nevertheless, her position was very\ngrievous to her, and the more so now that her aunt had twitted her\nwith ingratitude. When the servant came to her, she felt that she\nhad no right to the girl's services; and when a message was brought\nto her from Lady Ball, asking whether she would be taken out in the\ncarriage, she acknowledged to herself that such courtesy to her was\naltogether out of place.\n\nOn that evening her cousin said nothing to her, and on the next day\nhe went again up to town.\n\n\"What, four days running, John!\" said Lady Ball, at breakfast.\n\n\"I have particular business to-day, mother,\" said he.\n\nOn that evening, when he came back, he found a moment to take\nMargaret by the hand and tell her that his own lawyer also was to\nmeet them at Mr Slow's chambers on the day named. He took her thus,\nand held her hand closely in his while he was speaking, but he said\nnothing to her more tender than the nature of such a communication\nrequired.\n\n\"You and John are terribly mysterious,\" said Lady Ball to her, a\nminute or two afterwards. \"If there is anything I do hate it's\nmystery in families. We never had any with us till you came.\"\n\nOn the next day a letter reached her which had been redirected from\nGower Street. It was from Mr Maguire; and she took it up into her own\nroom to read it and answer it. The letter and reply were as follows:\n\n\n   Littlebath, Oct., 186--.\n\n   DEAREST MARGARET,\n\n   I hope the circumstances of the case will, in your\n   opinion, justify me in writing to you again, though I am\n   sorry to intrude upon you at a time when your heart must\n   yet be sore with grief for the loss of your lamented\n   brother. Were we now all in all to each other, as I\n   hope we may still be before long, it would be my sweet\n   privilege to wipe your eyes, and comfort you in your\n   sorrow, and bid you remember that it is the Lord who\n   giveth and the Lord who taketh away. Blessed be the name\n   of the Lord. I do not doubt that you have spoken to\n   yourself daily in those words, nay, almost hourly, since\n   your brother was taken from you. I had not the privilege\n   of knowing him, but if he was in any way like his sister,\n   he would have been a friend whom I should have delighted\n   to press to my breast and carry in my heart of hearts.\n\n   But now, dearest Margaret, will you allow me to intrude\n   upon you with another theme? Of course you well know the\n   subject upon which, at present, I am thinking more than on\n   any other. May I be permitted to hope that that subject\n   sometimes presents itself to you in a light that is not\n   altogether disagreeable. When you left Littlebath so\n   suddenly, carried away on a mission of love and kindness,\n   you left me, as you will doubtlessly remember, in a state\n   of some suspense. You had kindly consented to acknowledge\n   that I was not altogether indifferent to you.\n\n\n\"That's not true,\" said Margaret to herself, almost out loud; \"I\nnever told him anything of the kind.\"\n\n\n   And it was arranged that on that very day we were to have\n   had a meeting, to which--shall I confess it?--I looked\n   forward as the happiest moment of my life. I can hardly\n   tell you what my feelings were when I found that you were\n   going, and that I could only just say to you, farewell. If\n   I could only have been with you when that letter came I\n   think I could have softened your sorrow, and perhaps then,\n   in your gentleness, you might have said a word which would\n   have left me nothing to wish for in this world. But it has\n   been otherwise ordered, and, Margaret, I do not complain.\n\n   But what makes me write now is the great necessity that\n   I should know exactly how I stand. You said something in\n   your last dear letter which gave me to understand that you\n   wished to do something for your brother's family. Promises\n   made by the bed-sides of the dying are always dangerous,\n   and in the cases of Roman Catholics have been found to be\n   replete with ruin.\n\n\nMr Maguire, no doubt, forgot that in such cases the promises are made\nby, and not to, the dying person.\n\n\n   Nevertheless, I am far from saying that they should not\n   be kept in a modified form, and you need not for a moment\n   think that I, if I may be allowed to have an interest in\n   the matter, would wish to hinder you from doing whatever\n   may be becoming. I think I may promise you that you will\n   find no mercenary spirit in me, although, of course, I am\n   bound, looking forward to the tender tie which will, I\n   hope, connect us, to regard your interests above all other\n   worldly affairs. If I may then say a word of advice, it is\n   to recommend that nothing permanent be done till we can\n   act together in this matter. Do not, however, suppose that\n   anything you can do or have done, can alter the nature of\n   my regard.\n\n   But now, dearest Margaret, will you not allow me to press\n   for an immediate answer to my appeal? I will tell you\n   exactly how I am circumstanced, and then you will see\n   how strong is my reason that there should be no delay.\n   Very many people here, I may say all the elite of the\n   evangelical circles, including Mrs Perch--[Mrs Perch was\n   the coachmaker's wife, who had always been so true to Mrs\n   Stumfold]--desired that I should establish a church here,\n   on my own bottom, quite independent of Mr Stumfold. The\n   Stumfolds would then soon have to leave Littlebath, there\n   is no doubt of that, and she has already made herself\n   so unendurable, and her father and she together are so\n   distressing, that the best of their society has fallen\n   away from them. Her treatment to you was such that I\n   could never endure her afterwards. Now the opening for a\n   clergyman with pure Gospel doctrines would be the best\n   thing that has turned up for a long time. The church would\n   be worth over six hundred a year, besides the interest of\n   the money which would have to be laid out. I could have\n   all this commenced at once, and secure the incumbency,\n   if I could myself head the subscription list with two\n   thousand pounds. It should not be less than that. You will\n   understand that the money would not be given, though, no\n   doubt, a great many persons would, in this way, be induced\n   to give theirs. But the pew rents would go in the first\n   instance to provide interest for the money not given, but\n   lent; as would of course be the case with your money, if\n   you would advance it.\n\n   I should not think of such a plan as this if I did not\n   feel that it was the best thing for your interests; that\n   is, if, as I fondly hope, I am ever to call you mine.\n   Of course, in that case, it is only common prudence on\n   my part to do all I can to insure for myself such a\n   professional income, for your sake. For, dearest Margaret,\n   my brightest earthly hope is to see you with everything\n   comfortable around you. If that could be arranged, it\n   would be quite within our means to keep some sort of\n   carriage.\n\n\nHere would be a fine opportunity for rivalling Mrs Stumfold! That was\nthe temptation with which he hoped to allure her.\n\n\n   But the thing must be done quite immediately; therefore\n   let me pray you not to postpone my hopes with unnecessary\n   delay. I know it seems unromantic to urge a lady with\n   any pecuniary considerations, but I think that under the\n   circumstances, as I have explained them, you will forgive\n   me.\n\n   Believe me to be, dearest Margaret,\n   Yours, with truest,\n   Most devoted affection,\n\n   JEREH. MAGUIRE.\n\n\nOne man had wanted her money to buy a house on a mortgage, and\nanother now asked for it to build a church, giving her, or promising\nto give her, the security of the pew rents. Which of the two was\nthe worst? They were both her lovers, and she thought that he was\nthe worst who first made his love and then tried to get her money.\nThese were the ideas which at once occurred to her upon her reading\nMr Maguire's letter. She had quite wit enough to see through the\nwhole project; how outsiders were to be induced to give their\nmoney, thinking that all was to be given; whereas those inside the\ntemple,--those who knew all about it,--were simply to make for\nthemselves a good speculation. Her cousin John's constant solicitude\nfor money was bad; but, after all, it was not so bad as this. She\ntold herself at once that the letter was one which would of itself\nhave ended everything between her and Mr Maguire, even had nothing\noccurred to put an absolute and imperative stop to the affair. Mr\nMaguire pressed for an early answer, and before she left the room she\nsat down and wrote it.\n\n\n   The Cedars, Twickenham, October, 186--.\n\n   DEAR SIR\n\n\nBefore she wrote the words, \"Dear Sir,\" she had to think much of\nthem, not having had as yet much experience in writing letters to\ngentlemen; but she concluded at last that if she simply wrote \"Sir,\"\nhe would take it as an insult, and that if she wrote \"My dear Mr\nMaguire,\" it would, under the circumstances, be too affectionate.\n\n\n   DEAR SIR,\n\n   I have got your letter to-day, and I hasten to answer it\n   at once. All that to which you allude between us must be\n   considered as being altogether over, and I am very sorry\n   that you should have had so much trouble. My circumstances\n   are altogether changed. I cannot explain how, as it would\n   make my letter very long; but you may be assured that such\n   is the case, and to so great an extent that the engagement\n   you speak of would not at all suit you at present. Pray\n   take this as being quite true, and believe me to be\n\n   Your very humble servant,\n\n   MARGARET MACKENZIE.\n\n\nI feel that the letter was somewhat curt and dry as an answer to\nan effusion so full of affection as that which the gentleman had\nwritten; and the fair reader, when she remembers that Miss Mackenzie\nhad given the gentleman considerable encouragement, will probably\nthink that she should have expressed something like regret at so\nsudden a termination to so tender a friendship. But she, in truth,\nregarded the offer as having been made to her money solely, and as\nin fact no longer existing as an offer, now that her money itself was\nno longer in existence. She was angry with Mr Maguire for the words\nhe had written about her brother's affairs; for his wish to limit\nher kindness to her nephews and nieces, and also for his greediness\nin being desirous of getting her money at once; but as to the main\nquestion, she thought herself bound to answer him plainly, as she\nwould have answered a man who came to buy from her a house, which\nhouse was no longer in her possession.\n\nMr Maguire when he received her letter, did not believe a word of it.\nHe did not in the least believe that she had actually lost everything\nthat had once belonged to her, or that he, if he married her now,\nwould obtain less than he would have done had he married her before\nher brother's death. But he thought that her brother's family and\nfriends had got hold of her in London; that Mr Rubb might very\nprobably have done it; and that they were striving to obtain command\nof her money, and were influencing her to desert him. He thinking so,\nand being a man of good courage, took a resolution to follow his\ngame, and to see whether even yet he might not obtain the good things\nwhich had made his eyes glisten and his mouth water. He knew that\nthere was very much against him in the race that he was desirous of\nrunning, and that an heiress with--he did not know how much a year,\nbut it had been rumoured among the Stumfoldians that it was over\na thousand--might not again fall in his way. There were very many\nthings against him, of which he was quite conscious. He had not a\nshilling of his own, and was in receipt of no professional income. He\nwas not altogether a young man. There was in his personal appearance\na defect which many ladies might find it difficult to overcome; and\nthen that little story about his debts, which Miss Todd had picked\nup, was not only true, but was some degrees under the truth. No\ndoubt, he had a great wish that his wife should be comfortable; but\nhe also, for himself, had long been pining after those eligible\ncomforts, which when they appertain to clergymen, the world, with so\nmuch malice, persists in calling the flesh-pots of Egypt. Thinking\nof all this, of the position he had already gained in spite of his\npersonal disadvantages, and of the great chance there was that his\nMargaret might yet be rescued from the Philistines, he resolved upon\na journey to London.\n\nIn the meantime Miss Mackenzie's other lover had not been idle, and\nhe also was resolved by no means to give up the battle.\n\nIt cannot be said that Mr Rubb was not mercenary in his views, but\nwith his desire for the lady's money was mingled much that was\ncourageous, and something also that was generous. The whole truth\nhad been told to him as plainly as it had been told to Mr Ball, and\nnevertheless he determined to persevere. He went to work diligently\non that very afternoon, deserting the smiles of Miss Colza, and made\nsuch inquiries into the law of the matter as were possible to him;\nand they resulted, as far as Miss Mackenzie was concerned, in his\nappearing late one afternoon at the front door of Sir John Ball's\nhouse. On the day following this Miss Mackenzie was to keep her\nappointment with Mr Slow, and her cousin was now up in London among\nthe lawyers.\n\nMiss Mackenzie was sitting with her aunt when Mr Rubb called.\nThey were both in the drawing-room; and Lady Ball, who had as yet\nsucceeded in learning nothing, and who was more than ever convinced\nthat there was much to learn, was not making herself pleasant to her\ncompanion. Throughout the whole week she had been very unpleasant.\nShe did not quite understand why Margaret's sojourn at the Cedars\nhad been and was to be so much prolonged. Margaret, feeling herself\ncompelled to say something on the subject, had with some hesitation\ntold her aunt that she was staying till she had seen her lawyer\nagain, because her cousin wished her to stay.\n\nIn answer to this, Lady Ball had of course told her that she was\nwelcome. Her ladyship had then cross-questioned her son on that\nsubject also, but he had simply said that as there was law business\nto be done, Margaret might as well stay at Twickenham till it was\ncompleted.\n\n\"But, my dear,\" Lady Ball had said, \"her law business might go on for\never, for what you know.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said the son, sternly, \"I wish her to stay here at present,\nand I suppose you will not refuse to permit her to do so.\"\n\nAfter this, Lady Ball could go no further.\n\nOn the day on which Mr Rubb was announced in the drawing-room,\nthe aunt and niece were sitting together. \"Mr Rubb--to see Miss\nMackenzie,\" said the old servant, as he opened the door.\n\nMiss Mackenzie got up, blushing to her forehead, and Lady Ball rose\nfrom her chair with an angry look, as though asking the oilcloth\nmanufacturer how he dared to make his way in there. The name of the\nRubbs had been specially odious to all the family at the Cedars since\nTom Mackenzie had carried his share of Jonathan Ball's money into the\nfirm in the New Road. And Mr Rubb's appearance was not calculated to\nmitigate this anger. Again he had got on those horrid yellow gloves,\nand again had dressed himself up to his idea of the garb of a man of\nfashion. To Margaret's eyes, in the midst of her own misfortunes, he\nwas a thing horrible to behold, as he came into that drawing-room.\nWhen she had seen him in his natural condition, at her brother's\nhouse, he had been at any rate unobjectionable to her; and when,\non various occasions, he had talked to her about his own business,\npleading his own cause and excusing his own fault, she had really\nliked him. There had been a moment or two, the moments of his\nbitterest confessions, in which she had in truth liked him much. But\nnow! What would she not have given that the old servant should have\ntaken upon himself to declare that she was not at home.\n\nBut there he was in her aunt's drawing-room, and she had nothing to\ndo but to ask him to sit down.\n\n\"This is my aunt, Lady Ball,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"I hope I have the honour of seeing her ladyship quite well,\" said Mr\nRubb, bowing low before he ventured to seat himself.\n\nLady Ball would not condescend to say a word, but stared at him in a\nmanner that would have driven him out of the room had he understood\nthe nature of such looks on ladies' faces.\n\n\"I hope my sister-in-law and the children are well,\" said Margaret,\nwith a violent attempt to make conversation.\n\n\"Pretty much as you left them, Miss Mackenzie; she takes on a good\ndeal; but that's only human nature; eh, my lady?\"\n\nBut her ladyship still would not condescend to speak a word.\n\nMargaret did not know what further to say. All subjects on which it\nmight have been possible for her to speak to Mr Rubb were stopped\nfrom her in the presence of her aunt. Mr Rubb knew of that great\ncalamity of which, as yet, Lady Ball knew nothing,--of that great\ncalamity to the niece, but great blessing, as it would be thought by\nthe aunt. And she was in much fear lest Mr Rubb should say something\nwhich might tend to divulge the secret.\n\n\"Did you come by the train?\" she said, at last, reduced in her agony\nto utter the first unmeaning question of which she could think.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Mackenzie, I came by the train, and I am going back by the\n5.45, if I can just be allowed to say a few words to you first.\"\n\n\"Does the gentleman mean in private?\" asked Lady Ball.\n\n\"If you please, my lady,\" said Mr Rubb, who was beginning to think\nthat he did not like Lady Ball.\n\n\"If Miss Mackenzie wishes it, of course she can do so.\"\n\n\"It may be about my brother's affairs,\" said Margaret, getting up.\n\n\"It is nothing to me, my dear, whether they are your brother's or\nyour own,\" said Lady Ball; \"you had better not interrupt your uncle\nin the study; but I daresay you'll find the dining-room disengaged.\"\n\nSo Miss Mackenzie led the way into the dining-room, and Mr Rubb\nfollowed. There they found some of the girls, who stared very hard at\nMr Rubb, as they left the room at their cousin's request. As soon as\nthey were left alone Mr Rubb began his work manfully.\n\n\"Margaret,\" said he, \"I hope you will let me call you so now that you\nare in trouble?\"\n\nTo this she made no answer.\n\n\"But perhaps your trouble is over? Perhaps you have found out that it\nisn't as you told us the other day?\"\n\n\"No, Mr Rubb; I have found nothing of that kind; I believe it is as I\ntold you.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you what I propose. You haven't given up the fight,\nhave you? You have not done anything?\"\n\n\"I have done nothing as yet.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you my plan. Fight it out.\"\n\n\"I do not want to fight for anything that is not my own.\"\n\n\"But it is your own. It is your own of rights, even though it should\nnot be so by some quibble of the lawyers. I don't believe twelve\nEnglishmen would be found in London to give it to anybody else; I\ndon't indeed.\"\n\n\"But my own lawyer tells me it isn't mine, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"Never mind him; don't you give up anything. Don't you let them make\nyou soft. When it comes to money nobody should give up anything. Now\nI'll tell you what I propose.\"\n\nShe now sat down and listened to him, while he stood over her. It was\nmanifest that he was very eager, and in his eagerness he became loud,\nso that she feared his words might be heard out of the room.\n\n\"You know what my sentiments are,\" he said. At that moment she did\nnot remember what his sentiments were, nor did she know what he\nmeant. \"They're the same now as ever. Whether you have got your\nfortune, or whether you've got nothing, they're the same. I've\nseen you tried alongside of your brother, when he was a-dying, and,\nMargaret, I like you now better than ever I did.\"\n\n\"Mr Rubb, at present, all that cannot mean anything.\"\n\n\"But doesn't it mean anything? By Jove! it does though. It means just\nthis, that I'll make you Mrs Rubb to-morrow, or as soon as Doctors'\nCommons, and all that, will let us do it; and I'll chance the money\nafterwards. Do you let it just go easy, and say nothing, and I'll\nfight them. If the worst comes to the worst, they'll be willing\nenough to cry halves with us. But, Margaret, if the worst does come\nto be worse than that you won't find me hard to you on that account.\nI shall always remember who helped me when I wanted help.\"\n\n\"I am sure, Mr Rubb, I am much obliged to you.\"\n\n\"Don't talk about being obliged, but get up and give me your hand,\nand say it shall be a bargain.\" Then he tried to take her by the hand\nand raise her from the chair up towards him.\n\n\"No, no, no!\" said she.\n\n\"But I say yes. Why should it be no? If there never should come a\npenny out of this property I will put a roof over your head, and will\nfind you victuals and clothes respectably. Who will do better for you\nthan that? And as for the fight, by Jove! I shall like it. You'll\nfind they'll get nothing out of my hands till they have torn away my\nnails.\"\n\nHere was a new phase in her life. Here was a man willing to marry her\neven though she had no assured fortune.\n\n\"Margaret,\" said he, pleading his cause again, \"I have that love\nfor you that I would take you though it was all gone, to the last\nfarthing.\"\n\n\"It is all gone.\"\n\n\"Let that be as it may, we'll try it. But though it should be all\ngone, every shilling of it, still, will you be my wife?\"\n\nIt was altogether a new phase, and one that was inexplicable to her.\nAnd this came from a man to whom she had once thought that she might\nbring herself to give her hand and her heart, and her money also. She\ndid not doubt that if she took him at his word he would be good to\nher, and provide her with shelter, and food and raiment, as he had\npromised her. Her heart was softened towards him, and she forgot his\ngloves and his shining boots. But she could not bring herself to say\nthat she would love him, and be his wife. It seemed to her now that\nshe was under the guidance of her cousin, and that she was pledged to\ndo nothing of which he would disapprove. He would not approve of her\naccepting the hand of a man who would be resolved to litigate this\nmatter with him.\n\n\"It cannot be,\" she said. \"I feel how generous you are, but it cannot\nbe.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't it be?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr Rubb, there are things one cannot explain.\"\n\n\"Margaret, think of it. How are you to do better?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not; probably not. In many ways I am sure I could not do\nbetter. But it cannot be.\"\n\nNot then, nor for the next twenty minutes, but at last he took his\nanswer and went. He did this when he found that he had no more\nminutes to spare if he intended to return by the 5.45 train. Then,\nwith an angry gesture of his head, he left her, and hurried across to\nthe front door. Then, as he went out, Mr John Ball came in.\n\n\"Good evening, sir,\" said Mr Rubb. \"I am Mr Samuel Rubb. I have just\nbeen seeing Miss Mackenzie, on business. Good evening, sir.\"\n\nJohn Ball said never a word, and Samuel Rubb hurried across the\ngrounds to the railway station.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nShowing How the Third Lover Behaved\n\n\n\"What has that man been here for?\" Those were the first words which\nMr Ball spoke to his cousin after shutting the hall-door behind\nMr Rubb's back. When the door was closed he turned round and saw\nMargaret as she was coming out of the dining-room, and in a voice\nthat sounded to her as though he were angry, asked her the above\nquestion.\n\n\"He came to see me, John,\" said Miss Mackenzie, going back into the\ndining-room. \"He was my brother's partner.\"\n\n\"He said he came upon business; what business could he have?\"\n\nIt was not very easy for her to tell him what had been Mr Rubb's\nbusiness. She had no wish to keep anything secret from her cousin,\nbut she did not know how to describe the scene which had just taken\nplace, or how to acknowledge that the man had come there to ask her\nto marry him.\n\n\"Does he know anything of this matter of your money?\" continued Mr\nBall.\n\n\"Oh yes; he knows it all. He was in Gower Street when I told my\nsister-in-law.\"\n\n\"And he came to advise you about it?\"\n\n\"Yes; he did advise me about it. But his advice I shall not take.\"\n\n\"And what did he advise?\"\n\nThen Margaret told him that Mr Rubb had counselled her to fight it\nout to the last, in order that a compromise might at any rate be\nobtained.\n\n\"If it has no selfish object in view I am far from saying that he is\nwrong,\" said John Ball. \"It is what I should advise a friend to do\nunder similar circumstances.\"\n\n\"It is not what I shall do, John.\"\n\n\"No; you are like a lamb that gives itself up to the slaughterer. I\nhave been with one lawyer or the other all day, and the end of it\nis that there is no use on earth in your going to London to-morrow,\nnor, as far as I can see, for another week to come. The two lawyers\ntogether have referred the case to counsel for opinion,--for an\namicable opinion as they call it. From what they all say, Margaret,\nit seems to me clear that the matter will go against you.\"\n\n\"I have expected nothing else since Mr Slow spoke to me.\"\n\n\"But no doubt you can make a fight, as your friend says.\"\n\n\"I don't want to fight, John; you know that.\"\n\n\"Mr Slow won't let you give it up without a contest. He suggested\na compromise,--that you and I should divide it. But I hate\ncompromises.\" She looked up into his face but said nothing. \"The\ntruth is, I have been so wronged in the matter, the whole thing has\nbeen so cruel, it has, all of it together, so completely ruined me\nand my prospects in life, that were it any one but you, I would\nsooner have a lawsuit than give up one penny of what is left.\" Again\nshe looked at him, but he went on speaking of it without observing\nher. \"Think what it has been, Margaret! The whole of this property\nwas once mine! Not the half of it only that has been called yours,\nbut the whole of it! The income was actually paid for one half-year\nto a separate banking account on my behalf, before I was of age. Yes,\npaid to me, and I had it! My uncle Jonathan had no more legal right\nto take it away from me than you have to take the coat off my back.\nThink of that, and of what four-and-twenty thousand pounds would have\ndone for me and my family from that time to this. There have been\nnearly thirty years of this robbery!\"\n\n\"It was not my fault, John.\"\n\n\"No; it was not your fault. But if your brothers could pay me back\nall that they really owe me, all that the money would now be worth,\nit would come to nearly a hundred thousand pounds. After that, what\nis a man to say when he is asked to compromise? As far as I can see,\nthere is not a shadow of doubt about it. Mr Slow does not pretend\nthat there is a doubt. How they can fail to see the justice of it is\nwhat passes my understanding!\"\n\n\"Mr Slow will give up at once, I suppose, if I ask him?\"\n\n\"I don't want you to ask him. I would rather that you didn't say a\nword to him about it. There is a debt too from that man Rubb which\nthey advise me to abandon.\"\n\nIn answer to this, Margaret could say nothing, for she knew well that\nher trust in the interest of that money was the only hope she had of\nany maintenance for her sister-in-law.\n\nAfter a few minutes' silence he again spoke to her. \"He desires to\nknow whether you want money for immediate use.\"\n\n\"Who wants to know?\"\n\n\"Mr Slow.\"\n\n\"Oh no, John. I have money at the bankers', but I will not touch it.\"\n\n\"How much is there at the bankers?\"\n\n\"There is more than three hundred pounds; but very little more;\nperhaps three hundred and ten.\"\n\n\"You may have that.\"\n\n\"John, I don't want anything that is not my own; not though I had to\nwalk out to earn my bread in the streets to-morrow.\"\n\n\"That is your own, I tell you. The tenants have been ordered not to\npay any further rents, till they receive notice. You can make them\npay, nevertheless, if you wish it; at least, you might do so, till\nsome legal steps were taken.\"\n\n\"Of course, I shall do nothing of the kind. It was Mr Slow's people\nwho used to get the money. And am I not to go up to London\nto-morrow?\"\n\n\"You can go if you choose, but you will learn nothing. I told Mr Slow\nthat I would bid you wait till I heard from him again. It is time now\nfor us to get ready for dinner.\"\n\nThen, as he was going to leave the room, she took him by the coat and\nheld him again,--held him as fast as she had done on the pavement in\nLincoln's Inn Fields. There was a soft, womanly, trusting weakness in\nthe manner of her motion as she did this, which touched him now as it\nhad touched him then.\n\n\"John,\" she said, \"if there is to be so much delay, I must not stay\nhere.\"\n\n\"Why not, Margaret?\"\n\n\"My aunt does not like my staying; I can see that; and I don't think\nit is fair to do so while she does not know all about it. It is\nsomething like cheating her out of the use of the house.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell her.\"\n\n\"What, all? Had I not better go first?\"\n\n\"No; you cannot go. Where are you to go to? I will tell her\neverything to-night. I had almost made up my mind to do so already.\nIt will be better that they should both know it,--my father and my\nmother. My father probably will be required to say all that he knows\nabout the matter.\"\n\n\"I shall be ready to go at once if she wishes it,\" said Margaret.\n\nTo this he made no answer, but went upstairs to his bedroom, and\nthere, as he dressed, thought again, and again, and again of his\ncousin Margaret. What should he do for her, and in what way should he\ntreat her? The very name of the Mackenzies he had hated of old, and\ntheir names were now more hateful to him than ever. He had correctly\ndescribed his own feelings towards them when he said, either truly or\nuntruly, that they had deprived him of that which would have made his\nwhole life prosperous instead of the reverse. And it seemed as though\nhe had really thought that they had been in fault in this,--that they\nhad defrauded him. It did not, apparently, occur to him that the only\npersons he could blame were his uncle Jonathan and his own lawyers,\nwho, at his uncle's death, had failed to discover on his behalf what\nreally were his rights. Walter Mackenzie had been a poor creature\nwho could do nothing. Tom Mackenzie had been a mean creature who had\nallowed himself to be cozened in a petty trade out of the money which\nhe had wrongfully acquired. They were odious to him, and he hated\ntheir memories. He would fain have hated all that belonged to them,\nhad he been able. But he was not able to hate this woman who clung to\nhim, and trusted him, and felt no harsh feelings towards him, though\nhe was going to take from her everything that had been hers. She\ntrusted him for advice even though he was her adversary! Would he\nhave trusted her or any other human being under such circumstances?\nNo, by heavens! But not the less on that account did he acknowledge\nto himself that this confidence in her was very gracious.\n\nThat evening passed by very quietly as far as Miss Mackenzie was\nconcerned. She had some time since, immediately on her last arrival\nat the Cedars, offered to relieve her aunt from the trouble of making\ntea, and the duty had then been given up to her. But since Lady\nBall's affair in obtaining possession of her niece's secret, the post\nof honour had been taken away.\n\n\"You don't make it as your uncle likes it,\" Lady Ball had said.\n\nShe made her little offer again on this evening, but it was rejected.\n\n\"Thank you, no; I believe I had better do it myself,\" had been the\nanswer.\n\n\"Why can't you let Margaret make tea? I'm sure she does it very\nwell,\" said John.\n\n\"I don't see that you can be a judge, seeing that you take none,\" his\nmother replied; \"and if you please, I'd rather make the tea in my own\nhouse as long as I can.\"\n\nThis little allusion to her own house was, no doubt, a blow at her\nson, to punish him in that he had dictated to her in that matter of\nthe continued entertainment of her guest; but Margaret also felt it\nto be a blow at her, and resolved that she would escape from the\nhouse with as little further delay as might be possible. Beyond this,\nthe evening was very quiet, till Margaret, a little after tea, took\nher candle and went off wearily to her room.\n\nBut then the business of the day as regarded the Cedars began; for\nJohn Ball, before he went to bed, told both his father and his\nmother the whole story,--the story, that is, as far as the money\nwas concerned, and also as far as Margaret's conduct to him was\nconcerned; but of his own feelings towards her he said nothing.\n\n\"She has behaved admirably, mother,\" he said; \"you must acknowledge\nthat, and I think that she is entitled to all the kindness we can\nshow her.\"\n\n\"I have been kind to her,\" Lady Ball answered.\n\nThis had taken place in Lady Ball's own room, after they had left Sir\nJohn. The tidings had taken the old man so much by surprise, that he\nhad said little or nothing. Even his caustic ill-nature had deserted\nhim, except on one occasion, when he remarked that it was like his\nbrother Jonathan to do as much harm with his money as was within his\nreach.\n\n\"My memory in such a matter is worth nothing,--absolutely nothing,\"\nthe old man had said. \"I always supposed something was wrong. I\nremember that. But I left it all to the lawyers.\"\n\nIn Lady Ball's room the conversation was prolonged to a late hour of\nthe night, and took various twists and turns, as such conversations\nwill do.\n\n\"What are we to do about the young woman?\" That was Lady Ball's main\nquestion, arising, no doubt, from the reflection that the world would\nlean very heavily on them if they absolutely turned her out to starve\nin the streets.\n\nJohn Ball made no proposition in answer to this, having not as yet\nmade up his mind as to what his own wishes were with reference to the\nyoung woman. Then his mother made her proposition.\n\n\"Of course that money due by the Rubbs must be paid. Let her take\nthat.\" But her son made no reply to this other than that he feared\nthe Rubbs were not in a condition to pay the money.\n\n\"They would pay her the interest at any rate,\" said Lady Ball, \"till\nshe had got into some other way of life. She would do admirably for a\ncompanion to an old lady, because her manners are good, and she does\nnot want much waiting upon herself.\"\n\nOn the next morning Miss Mackenzie trembled in her shoes as she came\ndown to breakfast. Her uncle, whom she feared the most, would not be\nthere; but the meeting with her aunt, when her aunt would know that\nshe was a pauper and that she had for the last week been an impostor,\nwas terrible to her by anticipation. But she had not calculated that\nher aunt's triumph in this newly-acquired wealth for the Ball family\nwould, for the present, cover any other feeling that might exist. Her\naunt met her with a gracious smile, was very urbane in selecting a\nchair for her at prayers close to her own, and pressed upon her a\npiece of buttered toast out of a little dish that was always prepared\nfor her ladyship's own consumption. After breakfast John Ball again\nwent to town. He went daily to town during the present crisis; and,\non this occasion, his mother made no remark as to the urgency of his\nbusiness. When he was gone Lady Ball began to potter about the house,\nafter her daily custom, and was longer in her pottering than was\nusual with her. Miss Mackenzie helped the younger children in their\nlessons, as she often did; and when time for luncheon came, she\nhad almost begun to think that she was to be allowed to escape any\nconversation with her aunt touching the great money question. But\nit was not so. At one she was told that luncheon and the children's\ndinner was postponed till two, and she was asked by the servant to go\nup to Lady Ball in her own room.\n\n\"Come and sit down, my dear,\" said Lady Ball, in her sweetest voice.\n\"It has got to be very cold, and you had better come near the fire.\"\nMargaret did as she was bidden, and sat herself down in the chair\nimmediately opposite to her aunt.\n\n\"This is a wonderful story that John has told me,\" continued her\naunt--\"very wonderful.\"\n\n\"It is sad enough for me,\" said Margaret, who did not feel inclined\nto be so self-forgetful in talking to her aunt as she had been with\nher cousin.\n\n\"It is sad for you, Margaret, no doubt. But I am sure you have within\nyou that conscientious rectitude of purpose that you would not wish\nto keep anything for yourself that in truth belongs to another.\"\n\nTo this Margaret answered nothing, and her aunt went on.\n\n\"It is a great change to you, no doubt; and, of course, that is the\npoint on which I wish to speak to you most especially. I have told\nJohn that something must be done for you.\"\n\nThis jarred terribly on poor Margaret's feelings. Her cousin had said\nnothing, not a word as to doing anything for her. The man who had\ntold her of his love, and asked her to be his wife, not twelve months\nsince,--who had pressed her to be of all women the dearest to him\nand the nearest,--had talked to her of her ruin without offering her\naid, although this ruin to her would enrich him very greatly. She\nhad expected nothing from him, had wanted nothing from him; but by\ndegrees, when absent from him, the feeling had grown upon her that he\nhad been hard to her in abstaining from expressions of commiseration.\nShe had yielded to him in the whole affair, assuring him that nothing\nshould be done by her to cause him trouble; and she would have been\ngrateful to him if in return he had said something to her of her\nfuture mode of life. She had intended to speak to him about the\nhospital; but she had thought that she might abstain from doing so\ntill he himself should ask some question as to her plans. He had\nasked no such question, and she was now almost determined to go\naway without troubling him on the subject. But if he, who had once\nprofessed to love her, would make no suggestion as to her future\nlife, she could ill bear that any offer of the kind should come from\nher aunt, who, as she knew, had only regarded her for her money.\n\n\"I would rather,\" she replied, \"that nothing should be said to him on\nthe subject.\"\n\n\"And why not, Margaret?\"\n\n\"I desire that I may be no burden to him or anybody. I will go away\nand earn my bread; and even if I cannot do that, my relations shall\nnot be troubled by hearing from me.\"\n\nShe said this without sobbing, but not without that almost hysterical\nemotion which indicates that tears are being suppressed with pain.\n\n\"That is false pride, my dear.\"\n\n\"Very well, aunt. I daresay it is false; but it is my pride. I may be\nallowed to keep my pride, though I can keep nothing else.\"\n\n\"What you say about earning your bread is very proper; and I and John\nand your uncle also have been thinking of that. But I should be glad\nif some additional assistance should be provided for you, in the\nevent of old age, you know, or illness. Now, as to earning your\nbread, I remarked to John that you were peculiarly qualified for\nbeing a lady's companion.\"\n\n\"For being what, aunt?\"\n\n\"For being companion to some lady in the decline of life, who would\nwant to have some nice mannered person always with her. You have the\nadvantage of being ladylike and gentle, and I think that you are\npatient by disposition.\"\n\n\"Aunt,\" said Miss Mackenzie, and her voice as she spoke was hardly\ngentle, nor was it indicative of much patience. Her hysterics also\nseemed for the time to have given way to her strong passionate\nfeeling. \"Aunt,\" she said, \"I would sooner take a broom in my hand,\nand sweep a crossing in London, than lead such a life as that. What!\nmake myself the slave of some old woman, who would think that she had\nbought the power of tyrannising over me by allowing me to sit in the\nsame room with her? No, indeed! It may very likely be the case that I\nmay have to serve such a one in the kitchen, but it shall be in the\nkitchen, and not in the drawing-room. I have not had much experience\nin life, but I have had enough to learn that lesson!\"\n\nLady Ball, who during the first part of the conversation had been\nunrolling and winding a great ball of worsted, now sat perfectly\nstill, holding the ball in her lap, and staring at her niece. She was\na quick-witted woman, and it no doubt occurred to her that the great\nobjection to living with an old lady, which her niece had expressed\nso passionately, must have come from the trial of that sort of\nlife which she had had at the Cedars. And there was enough in Miss\nMackenzie's manner to justify Lady Ball in thinking that some such\nexpression of feeling as this had been intended by her. She had\nnever before heard Margaret speak out so freely, even in the days\nof her undoubted heiress-ship; and now, though she greatly disliked\nher niece, she could not avoid mingling something of respect and\nsomething almost amounting to fear with her dislike. She did not\ndare to go on unwinding her worsted, and giving the advantage of her\ncondescension to a young woman who spoke out at her in that way.\n\n\"I thought I was advising you for the best,\" she said, \"and I hoped\nthat you would have been thankful.\"\n\n\"I don't know what may be for the best,\" said Margaret, again\nbordering upon the hysterical in the tremulousness of her voice, \"but\nthat I'm sure would be for the worst. However, I've made up my mind\nto nothing as yet.\"\n\n\"No, my dear; of course not; but we all must think of it, you know.\"\n\nHer cousin John had not thought of it, and she did not want any one\nelse to do so. She especially did not want her aunt to think of it.\nBut it was no doubt necessary that her aunt should consider how long\nshe would be required to provide a home for her impoverished niece,\nand Margaret's mind at once applied itself to that view of the\nsubject. \"I have made up my mind that I will go to London next week,\nand then I must settle upon something.\"\n\n\"You mean when you go to Mr Slow's?\"\n\n\"I mean that I shall go for good. I have a little money by me, which\nJohn says I may use, and I shall take a lodging till--till--till--\"\nThen she could not go on any further.\n\n\"You can stay here, Margaret, if you please;--that is till something\nmore is settled about all this affair.\"\n\n\"I will go on Monday, aunt. I have made up my mind to that.\" It was\nnow Saturday. \"I will go on Monday. It will be better for all parties\nthat I should be away.\" Then she got up, and waiting no further\nspeech from her aunt, took herself off to her own room.\n\nShe did not see her aunt again till dinner-time, and then neither of\nthem spoke to each other. Lady Ball thought that she had reason to\nbe offended, and Margaret would not be the first to speak. In the\nevening, before the whole family, she told her cousin that she had\nmade up her mind to go up to London on Monday. He begged her to\nreconsider her resolution, but when she persisted that she would do\nso, he did not then argue the question any further. But on the Sunday\nhe implored her not to go as yet, and did obtain her consent to\npostpone her departure till Tuesday. He wished, he said, to be at\nany rate one day more in London before she went. On the Sunday she\nwas closeted with her uncle who also sent for her, and to him she\nsuggested her plan of becoming nurse at a hospital. He remarked that\nhe hoped that would not be necessary.\n\n\"Something will be necessary,\" she said, \"as I don't mean to eat\nanybody's bread but my own.\"\n\nIn answer to this he said that he would speak to John, and then that\ninterview was over. On the Monday morning John Ball said something\nrespecting Margaret to his mother which acerbated that lady more than\never against her niece. He had not proposed that anything special\nshould be done; but he had hinted, when his mother complained of\nMargaret, that Margaret's conduct was everything that it ought to be.\n\n\"I believe you would take anybody's part against me,\" Lady Ball had\nsaid, and then as a matter of course she had been very cross. The\nwhole of that day was terrible to Miss Mackenzie, and she resolved\nthat nothing said by her cousin should induce her to postpone her\ndeparture for another day.\n\nIn order to insure this by a few minutes' private conversation with\nhim, and also with the view of escaping for some short time from the\nhouse, she walked down to the station in the evening to meet her\ncousin. The train by which he arrived reached Twickenham at five\no'clock, and the walk occupied about twenty minutes. She met him just\nas he was coming out of the station gate, and at once told him that\nshe had come there for the sake of walking back with him and talking\nto him. He thanked her, and said that he was very glad to meet her.\nHe also wanted to speak to her very particularly. Would she take his\narm?\n\nShe took his arm, and then began with a quick tremulous voice to tell\nhim of her sufferings at the house. She threw no blame on her aunt\nthat she could avoid, but declared it to be natural that under such\ncircumstances as those now existing her prolonged sojourn at her\naunt's house should be unpleasant to both of them. In answer to all\nthis, John Ball said nothing, but once or twice lifted up his left\nhand so as to establish Margaret's arm more firmly on his own. She\nhardly noticed the motion, but yet she was aware that it was intended\nfor kindness, and then she broke forth with a rapid voice as to her\nplan about the hospital. \"I think we can manage better than that, at\nany rate,\" said he, stopping her in the path when this proposal met\nhis ear. But she went on to declare that she would like it, that she\nwas strong and qualified for such work, that it would satisfy her\naspirations, and be fit for her. And then, after that, she declared\nthat nothing should induce her to undertake the kind of life that had\nbeen suggested by her aunt. \"I quite agree with you there,\" said he;\n\"quite. I hate tabbies as much as you do.\"\n\nThey had now come to a little gate, of which John Ball kept a key,\nand which led into the grounds belonging to the Cedars. The grounds\nwere rather large, and the path through them extended for half a\nmile, but the land was let off to a grazier. When inside the wall,\nhowever, they were private; and Mr Ball, as soon as he had locked\nthe gate behind him, stopped her in the dark path, and took both her\nhands in his. The gloom of the evening had now come round them, and\nthe thick trees which formed the belt of the place, joined to the\nhigh wall, excluded from them nearly all what light remained.\n\n\"And now,\" said he, \"I will tell you my plan.\"\n\n\"What plan?\" said she; but her voice was very low.\n\n\"I proposed it once before, but you would not have it then.\"\n\nWhen she heard this, she at once drew both her hands from him, and\nstood before him in an agony of doubt. Even in the gloom, the trees\nwere going round her, and everything, even her thoughts, were obscure\nand misty.\n\n\"Margaret,\" said he, \"you shall be my wife, and the mother of my\nchildren, and I will love you as I loved Rachel before. I loved you\nwhen I asked you at Christmas, but I did not love you then as I love\nyou now.\"\n\nShe still stood before him, but answered him not a word. How often\nsince the tidings of her loss had reached her had the idea of such\na meeting as this come before her! how often had she seemed to\nlisten to such words as those he now spoke to her! Not that she had\nexpected it, or hoped for it, or even thought of it as being in truth\npossible; but her imagination had been at work, during the long hours\nof the night, and the romance of the thing had filled her mind, and\nthe poetry of it had been beautiful to her. She had known--she had\ntold herself that she knew--that no man would so sacrifice himself;\ncertainly no such man as John Ball, with all his children and his\nweary love of money! But now the poetry had come to be fact, and the\nromance had turned itself into reality, and the picture formed by her\nimagination had become a living truth. The very words of which she\nhad dreamed had been spoken to her.\n\n\"Shall it be so, my dear?\" he said, again taking one of her hands.\n\"You want to be a nurse; will you be my nurse? Nay; I will not ask,\nbut it shall be so. They say that the lovers who demand are ever the\nmost successful. I make my demand. Tell me, Margaret, will you obey\nme?\"\n\nHe had walked on now, but in order that his time might be sufficient,\nhe led her away from the house. She was following him, hardly knowing\nwhither she was going.\n\n\"Susanna,\" said he, \"shall come and live with the others; one more\nwill make no difference.\"\n\n\"And my aunt?\" said Margaret.\n\nIt was the first word she had spoken since the gate had been locked\nbehind her, and this word was spoken in a whisper.\n\n\"I hope my mother may feel that such a marriage will best conduce\nto my happiness; but, Margaret, nothing that my mother can say will\nchange me. You and I have known something of each other now. Of you,\nfrom the way in which things have gone, I have learned much. Few men,\nI take it, see so much of their future wives as I have seen of you.\nIf you can love me as your husband, say so at once honestly, and then\nleave the rest to me.\"\n\n\"I will,\" she said, again whispering; and then she clung to his hand,\nand for a minute or two he had his arm round her waist. Then he took\nher, and kissed her lips, and told her that he would take care of\nher, and watch for her, and keep her, if possible, from trouble.\n\nAh, me, how many years had rolled by since last she had been kissed\nin that way! Once, and once only, had Harry Handcock so far presumed,\nand so far succeeded. And now, after a dozen years or more, that game\nhad begun again with her! She had boxed Harry Handcock's ears when he\nhad kissed her; but now, from her lover of to-day, she submitted to\nthe ceremony very tamely.\n\n\"Oh, John,\" she said, \"how am I to thank you?\" But the thanks were\ntendered for the promise of his care, and not for the kiss.\n\nI think there was but little more said between them before they\nreached the door-step. When there, Mr Ball, speaking already with\nsomething of marital authority, gave her his instructions.\n\n\"I shall tell my mother this evening,\" he said, \"as I hate mysteries;\nand I shall tell my father also. Of course there may be something\ndisagreeable said before we all shake down happily in our places, but\nI shall look to you, Margaret, to be firm.\"\n\n\"I shall be firm,\" she said, \"if you are.\"\n\n\"I shall be firm,\" was the reply; and then they went into the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nMr Maguire Goes to London on Business\n\n\nMr Maguire made up his mind to go to London, to look after his\nlady-love, but when he found himself there he did not quite know what\nto do. It is often the case with us that we make up our minds for\ngreat action,--that in some special crisis of our lives we resolve\nthat something must be done, and that we make an energetic start; but\nwe find very soon that we do not know how to go on doing anything. It\nwas so with Mr Maguire. When he had secured a bed at a small public\nhouse near the Great Western railway station,--thinking, no doubt\nthat he would go to the great hotel on his next coming to town,\nshould he then have obtained the lady's fortune,--he scarcely knew\nwhat step he would next take. Margaret's last letter had been written\nto him from the Cedars, but he thought it probable that she might\nonly have gone there for a day or two. He knew the address of the\nhouse in Gower Street, and at last resolved that he would go boldly\nin among the enemy there; for he was assured that the family of the\nlady's late brother were his special enemies in this case. It was\nconsiderably past noon when he reached London, and it was about three\nwhen, with a hesitating hand, but a loud knock, he presented himself\nat Mrs Mackenzie's door.\n\nHe first asked for Miss Mackenzie, and was told that she was not\nstaying there. Was he thereupon to leave his card and go away? He had\ntold himself that in this pursuit of the heiress he would probably be\ncalled upon to dare much, and if he did not begin to show some daring\nat once, how could he respect himself, or trust to himself for future\ndaring? So he boldly asked for Mrs Mackenzie, and was at once shown\ninto the parlour. There sat the widow, in her full lugubrious weeds,\nthere sat Miss Colza, and there sat Mary Jane, and they were all busy\nhemming, darning, and clipping; turning old sheets into new ones; for\nnow it was more than ever necessary that Mrs Mackenzie should make\nmoney at once by taking in lodgers. When Mr Maguire was shown into\nthe room each lady rose from her chair, with her sheet in her hands\nand in her lap, and then, as he stood before them, at the other side\nof the table, each lady again sat down.\n\n\"A gentleman as is asking for Miss Margaret,\" the servant had said;\nthat same cook to whom Mr Grandairs had been so severe on the\noccasion of Mrs Mackenzie's dinner party. The other girl had been\nunnecessary to them in their poverty, and had left them.\n\n\"My name is Maguire, the Rev. Mr Maguire, from Littlebath, where I\nhad the pleasure of knowing Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\nThen the widow asked him to take a chair, and he took a chair.\n\n\"My sister-in-law is not with us at present,\" said Mrs Mackenzie.\n\n\"She is staying for a visit with her aunt, Lady Ball, at the Cedars,\nTwickenham,\" said Mary Jane, who had contrived to drop her sheet, and\nhustle it under the table with her feet, as soon as she learned that\nthe visitor was a clergyman.\n\n\"Lady Ball is the lady of Sir John Ball, Baronet,\" said Miss Colza,\nwhose good nature made her desirous of standing up for the honour of\nthe family with which she was, for the time, domesticated.\n\n\"I knew she had been at Lady Ball's,\" said the clergyman, \"as I heard\nfrom her from thence; but I thought she had probably returned.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no,\" said the widow, \"she ain't returned here, nor don't\nmean. We haven't the room for her, and that's the truth. Have we,\nMary Jane?\"\n\n\"That we have not, mamma; and I don't think aunt Margaret would think\nof such a thing.\"\n\nThen, thought Mr Maguire, the Balls must have got hold of the\nheiress, and not the Mackenzies, and my battle must be fought at the\nCedars, and not here. Still, as he was there, he thought possibly he\nmight obtain some further information; and this would be the easier,\nif, as appeared to be the case, there was enmity between the Gower\nStreet family and their relative.\n\n\"Has Miss Mackenzie gone to live permanently at the Cedars?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" said the widow.\n\n\"It isn't at all unlikely, mamma, that it may be so, when you\nconsider everything. It's just the sort of way in which they'll most\nlikely get over her.\"\n\n\"Mary Jane, hold your tongue,\" said her mother; \"you shouldn't say\nthings of that sort before strangers.\"\n\n\"Though I may not have the pleasure of knowing you and your amiable\nfamily,\" said Mr Maguire, smiling his sweetest, \"I am by no means a\nstranger to Miss Mackenzie.\"\n\nThen the ladies all looked at him, and thought they had never seen\nanything so terrible as that squint.\n\n\"Miss Mackenzie is making a long visit at the Cedars,\" said Miss\nColza, \"that is all we know at present. I am told the Balls are\nvery nice people, but perhaps a little worldly-minded; that's to be\nexpected, however, from people who live out of the west-end from\nLondon. I live in Finsbury Square, or at least, I did before I came\nhere, and I ain't a bit ashamed to own it. But of course the west-end\nis the nicest.\"\n\nThen Mr Maguire got up, saying that he should probably do himself the\npleasure of calling on Miss Mackenzie at the Cedars, and went his\nway.\n\n\"I wonder what he's after,\" said Mrs Mackenzie, as soon as the door\nwas shut.\n\n\"Perhaps he came to tell her to bear it all with Christian\nresignation,\" said Miss Colza; \"they always do come when anything's\nin the wind like that; they like to know everything before anybody\nelse.\"\n\n\"It's my belief he's after her money,\" said Mrs Mackenzie.\n\n\"With such a squint as that!\" said Mary Jane; \"I wouldn't have him\nthough he was made of money, and I hadn't a farthing.\"\n\n\"Beauty is but skin deep,\" said Miss Colza.\n\n\"And it's manners to wait till you are asked,\" said Mrs Mackenzie.\n\nMary Jane chucked up her head with disdain, thereby indicating that\nthough she had not been asked, and though beauty is but skin deep,\nstill she held the same opinion.\n\nMr Maguire, as he went away to a clerical advertising office in the\nneighbourhood of Exeter Hall, thought over the matter profoundly.\nIt was clear enough to him that the Mackenzies of Gower Street were\nnot interfering with him; very probably they might have hoped and\nattempted to keep the heiress among them; that assertion that there\nwas no room for her in the house--as though they were and ever had\nbeen averse to having her with them--seemed to imply that such was\nthe case. It was the natural language of a disappointed woman. But\nif so, that hope was now over with them. And then the young lady had\nplainly exposed the suspicions which they all entertained as to the\nBalls. These grand people at the Cedars, this baronet's family at\nTwickenham, must have got her to come among them with the intention\nof keeping her there. It did not occur to him that the baronet or the\nbaronet's son would actually want Miss Mackenzie's money. He presumed\nbaronets to be rich people; but still they might very probably be as\ndogs in the manger, and desirous of preventing their relative from\ndoing with her money that active service to humanity in general which\nwould be done were she to marry a deserving clergyman who had nothing\nof his own.\n\nHe made his visit to the advertising office, and learned that\nclergymen without cures were at present drugs in the market. He\ncouldn't understand how this should be the case, seeing that the\nnewspapers were constantly declaring that the supply of university\nclergymen were becoming less and less every day. He had come from\nTrinity, Dublin and after the success of his career at Littlebath,\nwas astonished that he should not be snapped at by the retailers of\ncuracies.\n\nOn the next day he visited Twickenham. Now, on the morning of that\nvery day Margaret Mackenzie first woke to the consciousness that\nshe was the promised wife of her cousin John Ball. There was great\ncomfort in the thought.\n\nIt was not only, nor even chiefly, that she who, on the preceding\nmorning, had awakened to the remembrance of her utter destitution,\nnow felt that all those terrible troubles were over. It was not\nsimply that her great care had been vanquished for her. It was this,\nthat the man who had a second time come to her asking for her love,\nhad now given her all-sufficient evidence that he did so for the sake\nof her love. He, who was so anxious for money, had shown her that he\ncould care for her more even than he cared for gold. As she thought\nof this, and made herself happy in the thought, she would not rise\nat once from her bed, but curled herself in the clothes and hugged\nherself in her joy.\n\n\"I should have taken him before, at once, instantly, if I could have\nthought that it was so,\" she said to herself; \"but this is a thousand\ntimes better.\"\n\nThen she found that the pillow beneath her cheek was wet with her\ntears.\n\nOn the preceding evening she had been very silent and demure, and her\nbetrothed had also been silent. There had been no words about the\ntea-making, and Lady Ball had been silent also. As far as she knew,\nMargaret was to go on the following day, but she would say nothing on\nthe subject. Margaret, indeed, had commenced her packing, and did not\nknow when she went to bed whether she was to go or not. She rather\nhoped that she might be allowed to go, as her aunt would doubtless\nbe disagreeable; but in that, and in all matters now, she would of\ncourse be guided implicitly by Mr Ball. He had told her to be firm,\nand of her own firmness she had no doubt whatever. Lady Ball, with\nall her anger, or with all her eloquence, should not talk her out of\nher husband. She could be firm, and she had no doubt that John Ball\ncould be firm also.\n\nNevertheless, when she was dressing, she did not fail to tell herself\nthat she might have a bad time of it that morning,--and a bad time of\nit for some days to come, if it was John's intention that she should\nremain at the Cedars. She was convinced that Lady Ball would not\nwelcome her as a daughter-in-law now as she would have done when the\nproperty was thought to belong to her. What right had she to expect\nsuch welcome? No doubt some hard things would be said to her; but\nshe knew her own courage, and was sure that she could bear any hard\nthings with such a hope within her breast as that which she now\npossessed. She left her room a little earlier than usual, thinking\nthat she might thus meet her cousin and receive his orders. And in\nthis she was not disappointed; he was in the hall as she came down,\nand she was able to smile on him, and press his hand, and make her\nmorning greetings to him with some tenderness in her voice. He looked\nheavy about the face, and almost more careworn than usual, but he\ntook her hand and led her into the breakfast-room.\n\n\"Did you tell your mother, John?\" she said, standing very close to\nhim, almost leaning upon his shoulder.\n\nHe, however, did not probably want such signs of love as this, and\nmoved a step away from her.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I told both my father and my mother. What she says\nto you, you must hear, and bear it quietly for my sake.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"I think that she is unreasonable, but still she is my mother.\"\n\n\"I shall always remember that, John.\"\n\n\"And she is old, and things have not always gone well with her. She\nsays, too, that you have been impertinent to her.\"\n\nMargaret's face became very red at this charge, but she made no\nimmediate reply.\n\n\"I don't think you could mean to be impertinent.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, John; but, of course, I shall feel myself much more\nbound to her now than I was before.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course; but I wish that nothing had occurred to make her so\nangry with you.\"\n\n\"I don't think that I was impertinent, John, though perhaps it might\nseem so. When she was talking about my being a companion to a lady,\nI perhaps answered her sharply. I was so determined that I wouldn't\nlead that sort of life, that, perhaps I said more than I should have\ndone. You know, John, that it hasn't been quite pleasant between us\nfor the last few days.\"\n\nJohn did know this, and he knew also that there was not much\nprobability of pleasantness for some days to come. His mother's last\nwords to him on the preceding evening, as he was leaving her after\nhaving told his story, did not give much promise of pleasantness for\nMargaret. \"John,\" she had said, \"nothing on earth shall induce me to\nlive in the same house with Margaret Mackenzie as your wife. If you\nchoose to break up everything for her sake, you can do it. I cannot\ncontrol you. But remember, it will be your doing.\"\n\nMargaret then asked him what she was to do, and where she was to\nlive. She would fain have asked him when they were to be married, but\nshe did not dare to make inquiry on that point. He told her that, for\nthe present, she must remain at the Cedars. If she went away it would\nbe regarded as an open quarrel, and moreover, he did not wish that\nshe should live by herself in London lodgings. \"We shall be able to\nsee how things go for a day or two,\" he said. To this she submitted\nwithout a murmur, and then Lady Ball came into the room.\n\nThey were both very nervous in watching her first behaviour, but were\nnot at all prepared for the line of conduct which she adopted. John\nBall and Margaret had separated when they heard the rustle of her\ndress. He had made a step towards the window, and she had retreated\nto the other side of the fire-place. Lady Ball, on entering the room,\nhad been nearest to Margaret, but she walked round the table away\nfrom her usual place for prayers, and accosted her son.\n\n\"Good-morning, John,\" she said, giving him her hand.\n\nMargaret waited a second or two, and then addressed her aunt.\n\n\"Good-morning, aunt,\" she said, stepping half across the rug.\n\nBut her aunt, turning her back to her, moved into the embrasure of\nthe window. It had been decided that there was to be an absolute cut\nbetween them! As long as she remained in that house Lady Ball would\nnot speak to her. John said nothing, but a black frown came upon his\nbrow. Poor Margaret retired, rebuked, to her corner by the chimney.\nJust at that moment the girls and children rushed in from the study,\nwith the daily governess who came every morning, and Sir John rang\nfor the servants to come to prayers.\n\nI wonder whether that old lady's heart was at all softened as she\nprayed? whether it ever occurred to her to think that there was any\nmeaning in that form of words she used, when she asked her God to\nforgive her as she might forgive others? Not that Margaret had in\ntruth trespassed against her at all; but, doubtless, she regarded\nher niece as a black trespasser, and as being quite qualified for\nforgiveness, could she have brought herself to forgive. But I fear\nthat the form of words on that occasion meant nothing, and that she\nhad been delivered from no evil during those moments she had been on\nher knees. Margaret sat down in her accustomed place, but no notice\nwas taken of her by her aunt. When the tea had been poured out, John\ngot up from his seat and asked his mother which was Margaret's cup.\n\n\"My dear,\" said she, \"if you will sit down, Miss Mackenzie shall have\nher tea.\"\n\n\"I will take it to her,\" said he.\n\n\"John,\" said his mother, drawing her chair somewhat away from the\ntable, \"if you flurry me in this way, you will drive me out of the\nroom.\"\n\nThen he had sat down, and Margaret received her cup in the usual way.\nThe girls and children stared at each other, and the governess, who\nalways breakfasted at the house, did not dare to lift her eyes from\noff her plate.\n\nMargaret longed for an opportunity of starting with John Ball, and\nwalking with him to the station, but no such opportunity came in her\nway. It was his custom always to go up to his father before he left\nhome, and on this occasion Margaret did not see him after he quitted\nthe breakfast table. When the clatter of the knives and cups was\nover, and the eating and drinking was at an end, Lady Ball left the\nroom and Margaret began to think what she would do. She could not\nremain about the house in her aunt's way, without being spoken to,\nor speaking. So she went to her room, resolving that she would not\nleave it till the carriage had taken off Sir John and her aunt. Then\nshe would go out for a walk, and would again meet her cousin at the\nstation.\n\nFrom her bedroom window she could see the sweep before the front of\nthe house, and at two o'clock she saw and heard the lumbering of the\ncarriage as it came to the door, and then she put on her hat to be\nready for her walk; but her uncle and aunt did not, as it seemed,\ncome out, and the carriage remained there as a fixture. This had been\nthe case for some twenty minutes, when there came a knock at her own\ndoor, and the maid-servant told her that her aunt wished to see her\nin the drawing-room.\n\n\"To see me?\" said Margaret, thoroughly surprised, and not a little\ndismayed.\n\n\"Yes, Miss; and there's a gentleman there who asked for you when he\nfirst come.\"\n\nNow, indeed, she was dismayed. Who could be the gentleman? Was it Mr\nSlow, or a myrmidon from Mr Slow's legal abode? Or was it Mr Rubb\nwith his yellow gloves again? Whoever it was there must be something\nvery special in his mission, as her aunt had, in consequence,\ndeferred her drive, and was also apparently about to drop her purpose\nof cutting her niece's acquaintance in her own house.\n\nBut we will go back to Mr Maguire. He had passed the evening and the\nmorning in thinking over the method of his attack, and had at last\nresolved that he would be very bold. He would go down to the Cedars,\nand claim Margaret as his affianced bride. He went, therefore, down\nto the Cedars, and in accordance with his plan as arranged, he gave\nhis card to the servant, and asked if he could see Sir John Ball\nalone. Now, Sir John Ball never saw any one on business, or, indeed,\nnot on business; and, after a while, word was brought out to Mr\nMaguire that he could see Lady Ball, but that Sir John was not well\nenough to receive any visitors. Lady Ball, Mr Maguire thought, would\nsuit him better than Sir John. He signified his will accordingly, and\non being shown into the drawing-room, found her ladyship there alone.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that he was a brave man, and that he was\ndoing a bold thing. He knew that he should find himself among\nenemies, and that his claim would be ignored and ridiculed by the\npersons whom he was about to attack; he knew that everybody, on first\nseeing him, was affrighted and somewhat horrified; he knew too,--at\nleast, we must presume that he knew,--that the lady herself had given\nhim no promise. But he thought it possible, nay, almost probable,\nthat she would turn to him if she saw him again; that she might own\nhim as her own; that her feelings might be strong enough in his\nfavour to induce her to throw off the thraldom of her relatives, and\nthat he might make good his ground in her breast, even if he could\nnot bear her away in triumph out of the hands of his enemies.\n\nWhen he entered the room Lady Ball looked at him and shuddered.\nPeople always did shudder when they saw him for the first time.\n\n\"Lady Ball,\" said he, \"I am the Rev. Mr Maguire, of Littlebath.\"\n\nShe was holding his card in her hand, and having notified to him that\nshe was aware of the fact he had mentioned, asked him to sit down.\n\n\"I have called,\" said he, taking his seat, \"hoping to be allowed to\nspeak to you on a subject of extreme delicacy.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Lady Ball, thinking to catch his eye, and failing in\nthe effort.\n\n\"I may say of very extreme delicacy. I believe your niece, Miss\nMargaret Mackenzie, is staying here?\" In answer to this, Lady Ball\nacknowledged that Miss Mackenzie was now at the Cedars.\n\n\"Have you any objection, Lady Ball, to allowing me to see her in your\npresence?\"\n\nLady Ball was a quick-thinking, intelligent, and, at the same time,\nprudent old lady, and she gave no answer to this before she had\nconsidered the import of the question. Why should this clergyman want\nto see Margaret? And would his seeing her conduce most to her own\nsuccess, or to Margaret's? Then there was the fact that Margaret was\nof an age which entitled her to the right of seeing any visitor who\nmight call on her. Thinking over all this as best she could in the\nfew moments at her command, and thinking also of this clergyman's\nstipulation that she was to be present at the interview, she\nsaid that she had no objection whatever. She would send for Miss\nMackenzie.\n\nShe rose to ring the bell, but Mr Maguire, also rising from his\nchair, stopped her hand.\n\n\"Pardon me for a moment,\" said he. \"Before you call Margaret to come\ndown I would wish to explain to you for what purpose I have come\nhere.\"\n\nLady Ball, when she heard the man call her niece by her Christian\nname, listened with all her ears. Under no circumstances but one\ncould such a man call such a woman by her Christian name in such\ncompany.\n\n\"Lady Ball,\" he said, \"I do not know whether you may be aware of it\nor no, but I am engaged to marry your niece.\"\n\nLady Ball, who had not yet resumed her seat, now did so.\n\n\"I had not heard of it,\" she said.\n\n\"It may be so,\" said Mr Maguire.\n\n\"It is so,\" said Lady Ball.\n\n\"Very probably. There are many reasons which operate upon young\nladies in such a condition to keep their secret even from their\nnearest relatives. For myself, being a clergyman of the Church of\nEngland, professing evangelical doctrines, and therefore, as I had\nneed not say, averse to everything that may have about it even a\nseeming of impropriety, I think it best to declare the fact to you,\neven though in doing so I may perhaps give some offence to dear\nMargaret.\"\n\nIt must, I think, be acknowledged that Mr Maguire was true to\nhimself, and that he was conducting his case at any rate with\ncourage.\n\nLady Ball was doubtful what she would do. It was on her tongue to\ntell the man that her niece's fortune was gone. But she remembered\nthat she might probably advance her own interests by securing an\ninterview between the two lovers of Littlebath in her own presence.\nShe never for a moment doubted that Mr Maguire's statement was true.\nIt never occurred to her that there had been no such engagement.\nShe felt confident from the moment in which Mr Maguire's important\ntidings had reached her ears that she had now in her hands the means\nof rescuing her son. That Mr Maguire would cease to make his demand\nfor his bride when he should hear the truth, was of course to be\nexpected; but her son would not be such an idiot, such a soft fool,\nas to go on with his purpose when he should learn that such a secret\nas this had been kept back from him. She had refused him, and taken\nup with this horrid, greasy, evil-eyed parson when she was rich; and\nthen, when she was poor,--even before she had got rid of her other\nengagement, she had come back upon him, and, playing upon his pity,\nhad secured him in her toils. Lady Ball felt well inclined to thank\nthe clergyman for coming to her relief at such a moment.\n\n\"It will be best that I should ask my niece to come down to you,\"\nsaid she, getting up and walking out of the room.\n\nBut she did not go up to her niece. She first went to Sir John and\nquieted his impatience with reference to the driving, and then, after\na few minutes' further delay for consideration, she sent the servant\nup to her niece. Having done this she returned to the drawing-room,\nand found Mr Maguire looking at the photographs on the table.\n\n\"It is very like dear Margaret, very like her, indeed,\" said he,\nlooking at one of Miss Mackenzie. \"The sweetest face that ever my\neyes rested on! May I ask you if you have just seen your niece, Lady\nBall?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I have not seen her; but I have sent for her.\"\n\nThere was still some little delay before Margaret came down. She\nwas much fluttered, and wanted time to think, if only time could be\nallowed to her. Perhaps there had come a man to say that her money\nwas not gone. If so, with what delight would she give it all to her\ncousin John! That was her first thought. But if so, how then about\nthe promise made to her dying brother? She almost wished that the\nmoney might not be hers. Looking to herself only, and to her own\nhappiness, it would certainly be better for her that it should not be\nhers. And if it should be Mr Rubb with the yellow gloves! But before\nshe could consider that alternative she had opened the door, and\nthere was Mr Maguire standing ready to receive her.\n\n\"Dearest Margaret!\" he exclaimed. \"My own love!\" And there he stood,\nwith his arms open, as though he expected Miss Mackenzie to rush into\nthem. He was certainly a man of very great courage.\n\n\"Mr Maguire!\" said she, and she stood still near the door. Then she\nlooked at her aunt, and saw that Lady Ball's eyes were keenly fixed\nupon her. Something like the truth, some approximation to the facts\nas they were, flashed upon her in a moment, and she knew that she had\nto bear herself in this difficulty with all her discretion and all\nher fortitude.\n\n\"Margaret,\" exclaimed Mr Maguire, \"will you not come to me?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Mr Maguire?\" said she, still standing aloof from\nhim, and retreating somewhat nearer to the door.\n\n\"The gentleman says that you are engaged to marry him,\" said Lady\nBall.\n\nMargaret, looking again into her aunt's face, saw the smile of\ntriumph that sat there, and resolved at once to make good her ground.\n\n\"If he has said that, he has told an untruth,--an untruth both\nunmanly and unmannerly. You hear, sir, what Lady Ball has stated. Is\nit true that you have made such an assertion?\"\n\n\"And will you contradict it, Margaret? Oh, Margaret! Margaret! you\ncannot contradict it.\"\n\nThe reader must remember that this clergyman no doubt thought and\nfelt that he had a good deal of truth on his side. Gentlemen when\nthey make offers to ladies, and are told by ladies that they may\ncome again, and that time is required for consideration, are always\ndisposed to think that the difficulties of the siege are over. And\nin nine cases out of ten it is so. Mr Maguire, no doubt, since\nthe interview in question, had received letters from the lady\nwhich should at any rate have prevented him from uttering any such\nassertion as that which he had now made; but he looked upon those\nletters as the work of the enemy, and chose to go back for his\nauthority to the last words which Margaret had spoken to him. He knew\nthat he was playing an intricate game,--that all was not quite on the\nsquare; but he thought that the enemy was playing him false, and that\nfalsehood in return was therefore fair. This that was going on was a\nrobbery of the Church, a spoiling of Israel, a touching with profane\nhands of things that had already been made sacred.\n\n\"But I do contradict it,\" said Margaret, stepping forward into the\nroom, and almost exciting admiration in Lady Ball's breast by her\ndemeanour. \"Aunt,\" said she, \"as this gentleman has chosen to come\nhere with such a story as this, I must tell you all the facts.\"\n\n\"Has he ever been engaged to you?\" asked Lady Ball.\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Oh, Margaret!\" again exclaimed Mr Maguire.\n\n\"Sir, I will ask you to let me tell my aunt the truth. When I was at\nLittlebath, before I knew that my fortune was not my own,\"--as she\nsaid this she looked hard into Mr Maguire's face--\"before I had\nbecome penniless, as I am now,\"--then she paused again, and still\nlooking at him, saw with inward pleasure the elongation of her\nsuitor's face, \"this gentleman asked me to marry him.\"\n\n\"He did ask you?\" said Lady Ball.\n\n\"Of course I asked her,\" urged Mr Maguire. \"There can be no denying\nthat on either side.\"\n\nHe did not now quite know what to do. He certainly did not wish to\nimpoverish the Church by marrying Miss Mackenzie without any fortune.\nBut might it not all be a trick? That she had been rich he knew, and\nhow could she have become poor so quickly?\n\n\"He did ask me, and I told him that I must take a fortnight to\nconsider of it.\"\n\n\"You did not refuse him, then?\" said Lady Ball.\n\n\"Not then, but I have done so since by letter. Twice I have written\nto him, telling him that I had nothing of my own, and that there\ncould be nothing between us.\"\n\n\"I got her letters,\" said Mr Maguire, turning round to Lady Ball. \"I\ncertainly got her letters. But such letters as those, if they are\nwritten under dictation--\"\n\nHe was rather anxious that Lady Bell should quarrel with him. In the\nprogramme which he had made for himself when he came to the house, a\nquarrel to the knife with the Ball family was a part of his tactics.\nHis programme, no doubt, was disturbed by the course which events had\ntaken, but still a quarrel with Lady Ball might be the best for him.\nIf she were to quarrel with him, it would give him some evidence that\nthis story about the loss of the money was untrue. But Lady Ball\nwould not quarrel with him. She sat still and said nothing. \"Nobody\ndictated them,\" said Margaret. \"But now you are here, I will tell you\nthe facts. The money which I thought was mine, in truth belongs to my\ncousin, Mr John Ball, and I--\"\n\nSo far she spoke loudly, With her face raised, and her eyes fixed\nupon him. Then as she concluded, she dropped her voice and eyes\ntogether. \"And I am now engaged to him as his wife.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Mr Maguire.\n\n\"That statement must be taken for what it is worth,\" said Lady Ball,\nrising from her seat. \"Of what Miss Mackenzie says now, I know\nnothing. I sincerely hope that she may find that she is mistaken.\"\n\n\"And now, Margaret,\" said Mr Maguire, \"may I ask to see you for one\nminute alone?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said she. \"If you have anything more to say I will\nhear it in my aunt's presence.\" She waited a few moments, but as he\ndid not speak, she took herself back to the door and made her escape\nto her own room.\n\nHow Mr Maguire took himself out of the house we need not stop to\ninquire. There must, I should think, have been some difficulty in the\nmanoeuvre. It was considerably past three when Sir John was taken\nout for his drive, and while he was in the carriage his wife told him\nwhat had occurred.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nStill at the Cedars\n\n\nMargaret, when she had reached her own room, and seated herself\nso that she could consider all that had occurred in quietness,\nimmediately knew her own difficulty. Of course Lady Ball would give\nher account of what had occurred to her son, and of course John would\nbe angry when he learned that there had been any purpose of marriage\nbetween her and Mr Maguire. She herself took a different view of the\nmatter now than that which had hitherto presented itself. She had not\nthought much of Mr Maguire or his proposal. It had been made under a\nstate of things differing much from that now existing, and the change\nthat had come upon her affairs had seemed to her to annul the offer.\nShe had learned to regard it almost as though it had never been.\nThere had been no engagement; there had hardly been a purpose in\nher own mind; and the moment had never come in which she could have\nspoken of it to her cousin with propriety.\n\nThat last, in truth, was her valid excuse for not having told him the\nwhole story. She had hardly been with him long enough to do more than\naccept the offer he had himself made. Of course she would have told\nhim of Mr Maguire,--of Mr Maguire and of Mr Rubb also, when first an\nopportunity might come for her to do so. She had no desire to keep\nfrom his knowledge any tittle of what had occurred. There had been\nnothing of which she was ashamed. But not the less did she feel that\nit would have been well for her that she should have told her own\nstory before that horrid man had come to the Cedars. The story would\nnow first be told to him by her aunt, and she knew well the tone in\nwhich it would be told.\n\nIt occurred to her that she might even yet go and meet him at the\nstation. But if so, she must tell him at once, and he would know that\nshe had done so because she was afraid of her aunt, and she disliked\nthe idea of excusing herself before she was accused. If he really\nloved her, he would listen to her, and believe her. If he did\nnot--why then let Lady Ball have her own way. She had promised to be\nfirm, and she would keep her promise; but she would not intrigue with\nthe hope of making him firm. If he was infirm of purpose, let him\ngo. So she sat in her room, even when she heard the door close after\nhis entrance, and did not go down till it was time for her to show\nherself in the drawing-room before dinner. When she entered the room\nwas full. He nodded at her with a pleasant smile, and she made up her\nmind that he had heard nothing as yet. Her uncle had excused himself\nfrom coming to table, and her aunt and John were talking together in\napparent eagerness about him. For one moment her cousin spoke to her\nbefore dinner.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" he said, \"that my father is sinking fast.\"\n\nThen she felt quite sure that he had as yet heard nothing about Mr\nMaguire.\n\nBut it was late in the evening, when other people had gone to bed,\nthat Lady Ball was in the habit of discussing family affairs with\nher son, and doubtless she would do so to-night. Margaret, before\nshe went up to her room, strove hard to get from him a few words of\nkindness, but it seemed as though he was not thinking of her.\n\n\"He is full of his father,\" she said to herself.\n\nWhen her bed-candle was in her hand she did make an opportunity to\nspeak to him.\n\n\"Has Mr Slow settled anything more as yet?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well, yes. Not that he has settled anything, but he has made a\nproposition to which I am willing to agree. I don't go up to town\nto-morrow, and we will talk it over. If you will agree to it, all the\nmoney difficulties will be settled.\"\n\n\"I will agree to anything that you tell me is right.\"\n\n\"I will explain it all to you to-morrow; and, Margaret, I have told\nMr Slow what are my intentions,--our intentions, I ought to say.\" She\nsmiled at him with that sweet smile of hers, as though she thanked\nhim for speaking of himself and her together, and then she took\nherself away. Surely, after speaking to her in that way, he would not\nallow any words from his mother to dissuade him from his purpose?\n\nShe could not go to bed. She knew that her fate was being discussed,\nand she knew that her aunt at that very time was using every argument\nin her power to ruin her. She felt, moreover, that the story might\nbe told in such a way as to be terribly prejudicial to her. And now,\nwhen his father was so ill, might it not be very natural that he\nshould do almost anything to lessen his mother's troubles? But to her\nit would be absolute ruin; such ruin that nothing which she had yet\nendured would be in any way like it. The story of the loss of her\nmoney had stunned her, but it had not broken her spirit. Her misery\nfrom that had arisen chiefly from the wants of her brother's family.\nBut if he were now to tell her that all must be over between them,\nher very heart would be broken.\n\nShe could not go to bed while this was going on, so she sat\nlistening, till she should hear the noise of feet about the house.\nSilently she loosened the lock of her own door, so that the sound\nmight more certainly come to her, and she sat thinking what she might\nbest do. It had not been quite eleven when she came upstairs, and at\ntwelve she did not hear anything. And yet she was almost sure that\nthey must be still together in that small room downstairs, talking of\nher and of her conduct. It was past one before she heard the door of\nthe room open. She heard it so plainly, that she wondered at herself\nfor having supposed for a moment that they could have gone without\nher noticing them. Then she heard her cousin's heavy step coming\nupstairs. In passing to his room he would not go actually by her\ndoor, but would be very near it. She looked through the chink, having\ncarefully put away her own candle, and could see his face as he came\nupon the top stair. It wore a look of trouble and of pain, but not,\nas she thought, of anger. Her aunt, she knew, would go to her room by\nthe back stairs, and would go through the kitchen and over the whole\nof the lower house, before she would come out on the landing to which\nMargaret's room opened. Then, seeing her cousin, the idea occurred\nto her that she would have it all over on that very night. If he\nhad heard that which changed his purpose, why should she be left in\nsuspense? He should tell her at once, and at once she would prepare\nherself for her future life.\n\nSo she opened the door a little way, and called to him.\n\n\"John,\" she said, \"is that you?\"\n\nShe spoke almost in a whisper, but, nevertheless, he heard her very\nclearly, and at once turned towards her room.\n\n\"Come in, John,\" she said, opening the door wider. \"I wish to speak\nto you. I have been waiting till you should come up.\"\n\nShe had taken off her dress, and had put on in place of it a white\ndressing-gown; but of this she had not thought till he was already\nwithin the room. \"I hope you won't mind finding me like this, but I\ndid so want to speak to you to-night.\"\n\nHe, as he looked at her, felt that he had no objection to make to her\nappearance. If that had been his only trouble concerning her he would\nhave been well satisfied. When he was within the room, she closed the\nlock of the door very softly, and then began to question him.\n\n\"Tell me,\" she said, \"what my aunt has been saying to you about that\nman that came here to-day.\"\n\nHe did not answer her at once, but stood leaning against the bed.\n\n\"I know she has been telling you,\" continued Margaret. \"I know she\nwould not let you go to bed without accusing me. Tell me, John, what\nshe has told you.\"\n\nHe was very slow to speak. As he had sat listening to his mother's\nenergetic accusation against the woman he had promised to marry,\nhearing her bring up argument after argument to prove that Margaret\nhad, in fact, been engaged to that clergyman,--that she had intended\nto marry that man while she had money, and had not, up to that day,\nmade him fully understand that she would not do so,--he had himself\nsaid little or nothing, claiming to himself the use of that night\nfor consideration. The circumstances against Margaret he owned to\nbe very strong. He felt angry with her for having had any lover at\nLittlebath. It was but the other day, during her winter visit to\nthe Cedars, that he had himself proposed to her, and that she had\nrejected him. He had now renewed his proposal, and he did not like to\nthink that there had been any one else between his overtures. And he\ncould not deny the strength of his mother's argument when she averred\nthat Mr Maguire would not have come down there unless he had had, as\nshe said, every encouragement. Indeed, throughout the whole affair,\nLady Ball believed Mr Maguire, and disbelieved her niece; and\nsomething of her belief, and something also of her disbelief,\ncommunicated itself to her son. But, still, he reserved to himself\nthe right of postponing his own opinion till the morrow; and as he\nwas coming upstairs, when Margaret saw him through the chink of the\ndoor, he was thinking of her smiles, of her graciousness, and her\ngoodness. He was remembering the touch of her hand when they were\ntogether in the square, and the feminine sweetness with which she had\nyielded to him every point regarding her fortune. When he did not\nspeak to her at once, she questioned him again.\n\n\"I know she has told you that Mr Maguire has been here, and that she\nhas accused me of deceiving you.\"\n\n\"Yes, Margaret, she has.\"\n\n\"And what have you said in return; or rather, what have you thought?\"\n\nHe had been leaning, or half sitting, on the bed, and she had placed\nherself beside him. How was it that she had again taken him by the\ncoat, and again looked up into his face with those soft, trusting\neyes? Was it a trick with her? Had she ever taken that other man by\nthe coat in the same way, and smitten him also with the battery of\nher eyes? The loose sleeve of her dressing-gown had fallen back, and\nhe could see that her arm was round and white, and very fair. Was\nshe conversant with such tricks as these? His mother had called her\nclever and cunning as a serpent. Was it so? Had his mother seen with\neyes clearer than his own, and was he now being surrounded by the\nmeshes of a false woman's web? He moved away from her quickly, and\nstood upon the hearth-rug with his back to the empty fire grate.\n\nThen she stood up also.\n\n\"John,\" she said, \"if you have condemned me, say so. I shall defend\nmyself for the sake of my character, but I shall not ask you to come\nback to me.\"\n\nBut he had not condemned her. He had not condemned her altogether,\nneither had he acquitted her. He was willing enough to hear her\ndefence, as he had heard his mother's accusation; but he was desirous\nof hearing it without committing himself to any opinion.\n\n\"I have been much surprised,\" he said, \"by what my mother has now\ntold me,--very much surprised indeed. If Mr Maguire had any claim\nupon your hand, should you not have told me?\"\n\n\"He had no claim; but no doubt it was right that I should tell you. I\nwas bound by my duty to tell you everything that had occurred.\"\n\n\"Of course you were--and yet you did not do it.\"\n\n\"But I was not so bound before what you said to me in the shrubbery\nlast night? Remember, John, it was but last night. Have I had a\nmoment to speak to you?\"\n\n\"If there was any question of engagement between you and him, you\nshould have told it me then, on the instant.\"\n\n\"But there was no question. He came to me one day and made me an\noffer. I will tell you everything, and I think you will believe me.\nI found him holding a position of respect, at Littlebath, and I was\nall alone in the world. Why should I not listen to him? I gave him no\nanswer, but told him to speak to me again after a while. Then came my\npoor brother's illness and death; and after that came, as you know,\nthe loss of all my money. In the meantime Mr Maguire had written,\nbut as I knew that my brother's family must trust to me for their\nsupport--that, at least, John was my hope then--I answered him that\nmy means were not the same as before, and that everything must be\nover. Then he wrote to me again after I had lost my money, and once\nI answered him. I wrote to him so that he should know that nothing\ncould come of it. Here are all his letters, and I have a copy of\nthe last I wrote to him.\" So saying, she pulled the papers out\nof her desk,--the desk in which still lay the torn shreds of her\npoetry,--and handed them to him. \"After that, what right had he to\ncome here and make such a statement as he did to my aunt? How can he\nbe a gentleman, and say what was so false?\"\n\n\"No one says that he is a gentleman,\" replied John Ball, as he took\nthe proffered papers.\n\n\"I have told you all now,\" said she; and as she spoke, a gleam of\nanger flashed from her eyes, for she was not in all respects a\nGriselda such as she of old. \"I have told you all now, and if further\nexcuse be wanting, I have none further to make.\"\n\nSlowly he read the letters, still standing up on the hearth-rug, and\nthen he folded them again into their shapes, and slowly gave them\nback to her.\n\n\"There is no doubt,\" said he, \"as to his being a blackguard. He was\nhunting for your money, and now that he knows you have got none, he\nwill trouble you no further.\" Then he made a move from the place on\nwhich he stood, as if he were going.\n\n\"And is that to be all, John?\" she said.\n\n\"I shall see you to-morrow,\" he replied. \"I am not going to town.\"\n\n\"But is that to be all to-night?\"\n\n\"It is very late,\" and he looked at his watch. \"I do not see that any\ngood can come of talking more about it now. Good-night to you.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" she said. Then she waited till the door was closed, and\nwhen he was gone she threw herself upon the bed. Alas! alas! Now once\nmore was she ruined, and her present ruin was ruin indeed.\n\nShe threw herself on the bed, and sobbed as though she would have\nbroken her heart in the bitterness of her spirit. She had told him\nthe plainest, simplest truest story, and he had received it without\none word of comment in her favour,--without one sign to show that her\ntruthfulness had been acknowledged by him! He had told her that this\nman, who had done her so great an injury, was a blackguard; but of\nher own conduct he had not allowed himself to speak. She knew that\nhis judgment had gone against her, and though she felt it to be\nhard,--very hard,--she resolved that she would make no protest\nagainst it. Of course she would leave the Cedars. Only a few hours\nsince she had assured herself that it was her duty henceforward to\nobey him in everything. But that was now all changed. Whatever he\nmight say to the contrary, she would go. If he chose to follow her\nwhither she went, and again ask her to be his wife she would receive\nhim with open arms. Oh, yes; let him only once again own that she was\nworthy of him, and then she would sit at his feet and confess her\nfolly, and ask his pardon a thousand times for the trouble she had\ngiven him. But unless he were to do this she would never again beg\nfor favour. She had made her defence, and had, as she felt, made it\nin vain. She would not condescend to say one other word in excuse of\nher conduct.\n\nAs for her aunt, all terms between Lady Ball and herself must be at\nan end. Lady Ball had passed a day with her in the house without\nspeaking to her, except when that man had come, and then she had\ntaken part with him! Her aunt, she thought, had been untrue to\nhospitality in not defending the guest within her own walls; she had\nbeen untrue to her own blood, in not defending her husband's niece;\nbut, worse than all that, ten times worse, she had been untrue as\nfrom one woman to another! Margaret, as she thought of this, rose\nfrom the bed and walked wildly through the room unlike any Griselda.\nNo; she would have no terms with Lady Ball. Lady Ball had understood\nit all, though John had not done so! She had known how it all was,\nand had pretended not to know. Because she had an object of her own\nto gain, she had allowed these calumnies to be believed! Let come\nwhat might, they should all know that Margaret Mackenzie, poor,\nwretched, destitute as she was, had still spirit enough to resent\nsuch injuries as these.\n\nIn the morning she sent down word by one of her young cousins that\nshe would not come to breakfast, and she asked that some tea might be\nsent up to her.\n\n\"Is she in bed, my dear?\" asked Lady Ball.\n\n\"No, she is not in bed,\" said Jane Ball. \"She is sitting up, and has\ngot all her things about the room as though she were packing.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" said Lady Ball; \"why does she not come down?\"\n\nThen Isabella, the eldest girl, was sent up to her, but Margaret\nrefused to show herself.\n\n\"She says she would rather not; but she wants to know if papa will\nwalk out with her at ten.\"\n\nLady Ball again said that this was nonsense, but tea and toast were\nat last supplied to her, and her cousin promised to be ready at the\nhour named. Exactly at ten o'clock, Margaret opened the schoolroom\ndoor, and asked one of the girls to tell her father that she would be\nfound on the walk leading to the long shrubbery.\n\nThere on the walk she remained, walking slowly backwards and forwards\nover a space of twenty yards, till he joined her. She gave him her\nhand, and then turned towards the long shrubbery, and he, following\nher direction, walked at her side.\n\n\"John,\" she said, \"you will not be surprised at my telling you that,\nafter what has occurred, I shall leave this place to-day.\"\n\n\"You must not do that,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah, but I must do it. There are some things John, which no woman\nshould bear or need bear. After what has occurred it is not right\nthat I should incur your mother's displeasure any longer. All my\nthings are ready. I want you to have them taken down to the one\no'clock train.\"\n\n\"No, Margaret; I will not consent to that.\"\n\n\"But, John, I cannot consent to anything else. Yesterday was a\nterrible day for me. I don't think you can know how terrible. What I\nendured then no one has a right to expect that I should endure any\nlonger. It was necessary that I should say something to you of what\nhad occurred, and that I said last night. I have no further call to\nremain here, and, most positively, I shall go to-day.\"\n\nHe looked into her face and saw that she was resolved, but yet he was\nnot minded to give way. He did not like to think that all authority\nover her was passing out of his hands. During the night he had\nnot made up his mind to pardon her at once. Nay, he had not yet\ntold himself that he would pardon her at all. But he was prepared\nto receive her tears and excuses, and we may say that, in all\nprobability, he would have pardoned her had she wept before him\nand excused herself. But though she could shed tears on this\nmatter,--though, doubtless, there were many tears to be shed by\nher,--she would shed no more before him in token of submission. If he\nwould first submit, then, indeed, she might weep on his shoulder or\nlaugh on his breast, as his mood might dictate.\n\n\"Margaret,\" he said, \"we have very much to talk over before you can\ngo.\"\n\n\"There will be time for that between this and one. Look here, John; I\nhave made up my mind to go. After what took place yesterday, it will\nbe better for us all that we should be apart.\"\n\n\"I don't see that, unless, indeed, you are determined to quarrel\nwith us altogether. I suppose my wishes in the matter will count for\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Yesterday morning they would have counted for everything; but not\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"And why not, Margaret?\"\n\nThis was a question to which it was so difficult to find a reply,\nthat she left it unanswered. They both walked on in silence for some\npaces, and then she spoke again.\n\n\"You said yesterday that you had been with Mr Slow, and that you had\nsomething to tell me. If you still wish to tell me anything, perhaps\nyou can do so now.\"\n\n\"Everything seems to be so much changed,\" said he, speaking very\ngloomily.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she; \"things are changed. But my confidence in Mr Slow,\nand in you, is not altered. If you like it, you can settle everything\nabout the money without consulting me. I shall agree to anything\nabout that.\"\n\n\"I was going to propose that your brother's family should have the\ndebt due by the Rubbs. Mr Slow thinks he might so manage as to secure\nthe payment of the interest.\"\n\n\"Very well; I shall be delighted that it should be so. I had hoped\nthat they would have had more, but that of course is all over. I\ncannot give them what is not mine.\"\n\nBut this arrangement, which would have been pleasant enough\nbefore,--which seemed to be very pleasant when John Ball was last\nin Mr Slow's chambers, telling that gentleman that he was going to\nmake everything smooth by marrying his cousin,--was not by any means\nso pleasant now. He had felt, when he was mentioning the proposed\narrangement to Margaret, that the very naming of it seemed to imply\nthat Mr Maguire and his visit were to go for nothing. If Mr Maguire\nand his visit were to go for much--to go for all that which Lady Ball\nwished to make of them--then, in such a case as that, the friendly\narrangement in question would not hold water. If that were to be so,\nthey must all go to work again, and Mr Slow must be told to do the\nbest in his power for his own client. John Ball was by no means\nresolved to obey his mother implicitly and make so much of Mr Maguire\nand his visit as all this; but how could he help doing so if Margaret\nwould go away? He could not as yet bring himself to tell her that Mr\nMaguire and the visit should go altogether for nothing. He shook his\nhead in his trouble, and pished and pshawed.\n\n\"The truth is, Margaret, you can't go to-day.\"\n\n\"Indeed I shall, John,\" said she, smiling. \"You would hardly wish to\nkeep me a prisoner, and the worst you could do would be to keep my\nluggage from me.\"\n\n\"Then I must say that you are very obstinate.\"\n\n\"It is not very often that I resolve to have my own way; but I have\nresolved now, and you should not try to balk me.\"\n\nThey had now come round nearly to the house, and she showed, by the\ndirection that she took, that she was going in.\n\n\"You will go?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she; \"I will go. My address will be at the old house in\nArundel Street. Shall I see you again before I go?\" she asked him,\nwhen she stood on the doorstep. \"Perhaps you will be busy, and I had\nbetter say goodbye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said he, very gloomily; but he took her hand.\n\n\"I suppose I had better not disturb my uncle. You will give him my\nlove. And, John, you will tell some one about my luggage; will you\nnot?\"\n\nHe muttered some affirmative, and then went round from the front of\nthe house, while she entered the hall.\n\nIt was now half-past eleven, and she intended to start at half-past\ntwelve. She went into the drawing-room and not finding her aunt, rang\nthe bell. Lady Ball was with Sir John, she was told. She then wrote a\nnote on a scrap of paper, and sent it in:\n\n\n   DEAR AUNT,\n\n   I leave here at half-past twelve. Perhaps you would like\n   to see me before I go.\n\n   M. M.\n\n\nThen, while she was waiting for an answer, she went into the school\nroom, and said good-bye to all the children.\n\n\"But you are coming back, aunt Meg,\" said the youngest girl.\n\nMargaret stooped down to kiss her, and, when the child saw and felt\nthe tears, she asked no further questions.\n\n\"Lady Ball is in the drawing-room, Miss,\" a servant said at that\nmoment, and there she went to fight her last battle!\n\n\"What's the meaning of this, Margaret?\" said her aunt.\n\n\"Simply that I am going. I was to have gone on Monday, as you will\nremember.\"\n\n\"But it was understood that you were to stop.\"\n\nFor a moment or two Margaret said nothing.\n\n\"I hate these sudden changes,\" said Lady Ball; \"they are hardly\nrespectable. I don't think you should leave the house in this way,\nwithout having given notice to any one. What will the servants think\nof it?\"\n\n\"They will probably think the truth, aunt. They probably thought\nthat, when they saw that you did not speak to me yesterday morning.\nYou can hardly imagine that I should stay in the house under such\ncircumstances as that.\"\n\n\"You must do as you like, of course.\"\n\n\"In this instance I must, aunt. I suppose I cannot see my uncle?\"\n\n\"It is quite out of the question.\"\n\n\"Then I will say good-bye to you. I have said good-bye to John.\nGood-bye, aunt,\" and Margaret put out her hand.\n\nBut Lady Ball did not put out hers.\n\n\"Good-bye, Margaret,\" she said. \"There are circumstances under which\nit is impossible for a person to make any expression of feeling that\nmay be taken for approbation. I hope a time may come when these\nthings shall have passed away, and that I may be able to see you\nagain.\" Margaret's eyes, as she made her way out of the room were\nfull of tears, and when she found herself outside the hall door, and\nat the bottom of the steps, she was obliged to put her handkerchief\nup to them. Before her on the road was a boy with a donkey cart\nand her luggage. She looked round furtively, half-fearing, half\nhoping--hardly expecting, but yet thinking, that she might again see\nher cousin. But he did not show himself to her as she walked down to\nthe railway station by herself. As she went she told herself that she\nwas right; she applauded her own courage, but what, oh! what was she\nto do? Everything now was over for her. Her fortune was gone. The man\nwhom she had learned to love had left her. There was no place in the\nworld on which her feet might rest till she had made one for herself\nby the work of her hands. And as for friends--was there a single\nbeing in the world whom she could now call her friend?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nThe Lodgings of Mrs Buggins, N\u00c3\u00a9e Protheroe\n\n\nIt was nearly the end of October when Miss Mackenzie left the Cedars\nand at that time of the year there is not much difficulty in getting\nlodgings in London. The house which her brother Walter occupied in\nArundel Street had, at his death, remained in the hands of an old\nservant of his, who had bought her late master's furniture with her\nsavings, and had continued to live there, letting out the house in\nlodgings. Her former mistress had gone to see her once or twice\nduring the past year, and it had been understood between them, that\nif Miss Mackenzie ever wanted a room for a night or two in London,\nshe could be accommodated at the old house. She would have preferred\nto write to Hannah Protheroe,--or Mrs Protheroe, as she was now\ncalled by brevet rank since she had held a house of her own,--had\ntime permitted her to do so. But time and the circumstances did not\npermit this, and therefore she had herself driven to Arundel Street\nwithout any notice.\n\nMrs Protheroe received her with open arms, and with many promises\nof comfort and attendance,--as was to be expected, seeing that Mrs\nProtheroe was, as she thought, receiving into her house the rich\nheiress. She proffered at once the use of her drawing-room and of the\nbest bedroom, and declared that as the house was now empty, with the\nexception of one young gentleman from Somerset House upstairs, she\nwould be able to devote herself almost exclusively to Miss Mackenzie.\nThings were much changed from those former days in which Hannah\nProtheroe used frequently to snub Margaret Mackenzie, being almost of\nequal standing in the house with her young mistress. And now Margaret\nwas called upon to explain, that low as her standing might have been\nthen, at this present moment it was even lower. She had indeed the\nmeans of paying for her lodgings, but these she was called upon to\nhusband with the minutest economy. The task of telling all this was\ndifficult. She began it by declining the drawing-room, and by saying\nthat a bedroom upstairs would suffice for her.\n\n\"You haven't heard, Hannah, what has happened to me,\" she said, when\nMrs Protheroe expressed her surprise at this decision. \"My brother's\nwill was no will at all. I do not get any of his property. It all\ngoes under some other will to my cousin, Mr John Ball.\"\n\nBy these tidings Hannah was of course prostrated, and driven into a\nstate of excitement that was not without its pleasantness as far as\nshe was concerned. Of course she objected that the last will must be\nthe real will, and in this way the matter came to full discussion\nbetween them.\n\n\"And, after all, that John Ball is to have everything!\" said Mrs\nProtheroe, holding up both her hands. By this time Hannah Protheroe\nhad got herself comfortably into a chair, and no doubt her personal\npleasure in the evening's occupation was considerably enhanced by the\nunconscious feeling that she was the richer woman of the two. But she\nbehaved very well, and I am inclined to think, in preparing buttered\nmuffins for her guest, she was more particular in the toasting, and\nmore generous with the butter, than she would have been had she been\npreparing the dainty for drawing-room use. And when she learned that\nMargaret had eaten nothing since breakfast, she herself went out\nand brought in a sweetbread with her own hand, though she kept a\nservant whom she might have sent to the shop. And, for the honour of\nlodging-house keepers, I protest that that sweetbread never made its\nappearance in any bill.\n\n\"You will be more comfortable down here with me, won't you, my dear,\nthan up there, with not a creature to speak to?\"\n\nIn this way Mrs Protheroe made her apology for giving Miss Mackenzie\nher tea downstairs, in a little back parlour behind the kitchen. It\nwas a tidy room, with two wooden armchairs, and a bit of carpet over\nthe flags in the centre, and a rug before the fire. Margaret did\nnot inquire why it smelt of tobacco, nor did Mrs Protheroe think\nit necessary to give any explanation why she went up herself at\nhalf-past seven to answer the bell at the area; nor did she say\nanything then of the office messenger from Somerset House, who often\nfound this little room convenient for his evening pipe. So was passed\nthe first evening after our Griselda had left the Cedars.\n\nThe next day she sat at home doing nothing,--still talking to Hannah\nProtheroe, and thinking that perhaps John Ball might come. But he\ndid not come. She dined downstairs, at one o'clock, in the same\nroom behind the kitchen, and then she had tea at six. But as Hannah\nintimated that perhaps a gentleman friend would look in during\nthe evening, she was obliged to betake herself, after tea, to the\nsolitude of her own room. As Hannah was between fifty and sixty, and\nnearer the latter age than the former, there could be no objection to\nher receiving what visitors she pleased. The third day passed with\nMiss Mackenzie the same as the second, and still no cousin came to\nsee her. The next day, being Sunday, she diversified by going to\nchurch three times; but on the Sunday she was forced to dine alone,\nas the gentleman friend usually came in on that day to eat his bit of\nmutton with his friend, Mrs Protheroe.\n\n\"A most respectable man, in the Admiralty branch, Miss Margaret, and\nwill have a pension of twenty-seven shillings and sixpence a week in\na year or two. And it is so lonely by oneself, you know.\"\n\nThen Miss Mackenzie knew that Hannah Protheroe intended to become\nHannah Buggins, and she understood the whole mystery of the tobacco\nsmoke.\n\nOn the Monday she went to the house in Gower Street, and communicated\nto them the fact that she had left the Cedars. Miss Colza was in the\nroom with her sister-in-law and nieces, and as it was soon evident\nthat Miss Colza knew the whole history of her misfortune with\nreference to the property, she talked about her affairs before Miss\nColza as though that young lady had been one of her late brother's\nfamily. But yet she felt that she did not like Miss Colza, and once\nor twice felt almost inclined to resent certain pushing questions\nwhich Miss Colza addressed to her.\n\n\"And have you quarrelled with all the Ball family?\" the young lady\nasked, putting great emphasis on the word all.\n\n\"I did not say that I had quarrelled with any of them,\" said Miss\nMackenzie.\n\n\"Oh! I beg pardon. I thought as you came away so sudden like, and as\nyou didn't see any of them since, you know--\"\n\n\"It is a matter of no importance whatever,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"No: none in the least,\" said Miss Colza. And in this way they made\nup their minds to hate each other.\n\nBut what did the woman mean by talking in this way of all the Balls,\nas though a quarrel with one of the family was a thing of more\nimportance than a quarrel with any of the others? Could she know, or\ncould she even guess, anything of John Ball and of the offer he had\nmade? But this mystery was soon cleared up in Margaret's mind, when,\nat Mrs Mackenzie's request, they two went upstairs into that lady's\nbedroom for a little private conversation.\n\nThe conversation was desired for purposes appertaining solely to the\nconvenience of the widow. She wanted some money, and then, with tears\nin her eyes, she demanded to know what was to be done. Miss Colza\npaid her eighteen shillings a week for board and lodging, and that\nwas now two weeks in arrear; and one bedroom was let to a young man\nemployed in the oilcloth factory, at seven shillings a week.\n\n\"And the rent is ninety pounds, and the taxes twenty-two,\" said Mrs\nMackenzie, with her handkerchief up to her eyes; \"and there's the\ntaxman come now for seven pound ten, and where I'm to get it, unless\nI coined my blood, I don't know.\"\n\nMargaret gave her two sovereigns which she had in her purse, and\npromised to send her a cheque for the amount of the taxes due.\nThen she told as much as she could tell of that proposal as to the\ninterest of the money due from the firm in the New Road.\n\n\"If it could only be made certain,\" said the widow, who had fallen\nmuch from her high ideas since Margaret had last seen her. Things\nwere greatly changed in that house since the day on which the dinner,\n\u00c3\u00a0 la Russe, had been given under the auspices of Mr Grandairs. \"If\nit can only be made certain. They still keep his name up in the firm.\nThere it is as plain as life over the place of business\"--she would\nnot even yet call it a shop--\"Rubb and Mackenzie; and yet they won't\nlet me know anything as to how matters are going on. I went there the\nother day, and they would tell me nothing. And as for Samuel Rubb, he\nhasn't been here this last fortnight, and I've got no one to see me\nrighted. If you were to ask Mr Slow, wouldn't he be able to see me\nrighted?\"\n\nMargaret declared that she hardly knew whether that would come\nwithin Mr Slow's line of business, and that she did not feel herself\ncompetent to give advice on such a point as that. She then explained,\nas best she could, that her own affairs were not as yet settled, but\nthat she was led to hope, from what had been said to her, that the\ninterest due by the firm on the money borrowed might become a fixed\nannual income for Mrs Mackenzie's benefit.\n\nAfter that it came out that Mr Maguire had again been in Gower\nStreet.\n\n\"And he was alone, for the best part of half an hour, with that young\nwoman downstairs,\" said Mrs Mackenzie.\n\n\"And you saw him?\" Margaret asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes; I saw him afterwards.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"He didn't say much to me. Only he gave me to understand--at least,\nthat is what I suppose he meant--that you and he-- He meant to say,\nthat you and he had been courting, I suppose.\"\n\nThen Margaret understood why Miss Colza had desired to know whether\nshe had quarrelled with all the Balls. In her open and somewhat\nindignant speech in the drawing-room at the Cedars, she had declared\nbefore Mr Maguire, in her aunt's presence, that she was engaged to\nmarry her cousin, John Ball. Mr Maguire had now enlisted Miss Colza\nin his service, and had told Miss Colza what had occurred. But still\nMiss Mackenzie did not thoroughly understand the matter. Why, she\nasked herself, should Mr Maguire trouble himself further, now that he\nknew that she had no fortune? But, in truth, it was not so easy to\nsatisfy Mr Maguire on that point, as it was to satisfy Miss Mackenzie\nherself. He believed that the relatives of his lady-love were\nrobbing her, or that they were, at any rate, taking advantage of her\nweakness. If it might be given to him to rescue her and her fortune\nfrom them, then, in such case as that, surely he would get his\nreward. The reader will therefore understand why Miss Colza was\nanxious to know whether Miss Mackenzie had quarrelled with all the\nBalls.\n\nMargaret's face became unusually black when she was told that she\nand Mr Maguire had been courting, but she did not contradict the\nassertion. She did, however, express her opinion of that gentleman.\n\n\"He is a mean, false, greedy man,\" she said, and then paused a\nmoment; \"and he has been the cause of my ruin.\" She would not,\nhowever, explain what she meant by this, and left the house, without\ngoing back to the room in which Miss Colza was sitting.\n\nAbout a week afterwards she got a letter from Mr Slow, in which that\ngentleman,--or rather the firm, for the letter was signed Slow and\nBideawhile,--asked her whether she was in want of immediate funds.\nThe affair between her and her cousin was not yet, they said, in a\nstate for final settlement, but they would be justified in supplying\nher own immediate wants out of the estate. To this she sent a reply,\nsaying that she had money for her immediate wants, but that she would\nfeel very grateful if anything could be done for Mrs Mackenzie and\nher family. Then she got a further letter, very short, saying that a\nhalf-year's interest on the loan had, by Mr Ball's consent, been paid\nto Mrs Mackenzie by Rubb and Mackenzie.\n\nOn the day following this, when she was sitting up in her bedroom,\nMrs Protheroe came to her, dressed in wonderful habiliments. She\nwore a dark-blue bonnet, filled all round with yellow flowers, and a\nspotted silk dress, of which the prevailing colour was scarlet. She\nwas going, she said, to St Mary-le-Strand, \"to be made Mrs Buggins\nof.\" She tried to carry it off with bravado when she entered the\nroom, but she left it with a tear in her eye, and a whimper in her\nthroat. \"To be sure, I'm an old woman,\" she said before she went.\n\"Who has said that I ain't? Not I; nor yet Buggins. We is both of us\nold. But I don't know why we is to be desolate and lonely all our\ndays, because we ain't young. It seems to me that the young folks is\nto have it all to themselves, and I'm sure I don't know why.\" Then\nshe went, clearly resolved, that as far as she was concerned, the\nyoung people shouldn't have it all to themselves; and as Buggins was\nof the same way of thinking, they were married at St Mary-le-Strand\nthat very morning.\n\nAnd this marriage would have been of no moment to us or to our little\nhistory, had not Mr Maguire chosen that morning, of all mornings\nin the year, to call on Miss Mackenzie in Arundel Street. He had\nobtained her address--of course, from Miss Colza; and, not having\nbeen idle the while in pushing his inquiries respecting Miss\nMackenzie's affairs, had now come to Arundel Street to carry on the\nbattle as best he might. Margaret was still in her room as he came,\nand as the girl could not show the gentleman up there, she took him\ninto an empty parlour, and brought the tidings up to the lodger. Mr\nMaguire had not sent up his name; but a personal description by the\ngirl at once made Margaret know who was there.\n\n\"I won't see him,\" said she, with heightened colour, grieving greatly\nthat the strong-minded Hannah Protheroe,--or Buggins, as it might\nprobably be by that time,--was not at home. \"Martha, don't let him\ncome up. Tell him to go away at once.\"\n\nAfter some persuasion, the girl went down with the message, which she\nsoftened to suit her own idea of propriety. But she returned, saying\nthat the gentleman was very urgent. He insisted that he must see Miss\nMackenzie, if only for an instant, before he left the house.\n\n\"Tell him,\" said Margaret, \"that nothing shall induce me to see him.\nI'll send for a policeman. If he won't go when he's told, Martha, you\nmust go for a policeman.\"\n\nMartha, when she heard that, became frightened about the spoons and\ncoats, and ran down again in a hurry. Then she came up again with a\nscrap of paper, on which a few words had been written with a pencil.\nThis was passed through a very narrow opening in the door, as\nMargaret stood with it guarded, fearing lest the enemy might carry\nthe point by an assault.\n\n\"You are being robbed,\" said the note, \"you are, indeed,--and my only\nwish is to protect you.\"\n\n\"Tell him that there is no answer, and that I will receive no more\nnotes from him,\" said Margaret. Then, at last, when he received that\nmessage, Mr Maguire went away.\n\nAbout a week after that, another visitor came to Miss Mackenzie, and\nhim she received. But he was not the man for whose coming she in\ntruth longed. It was Mr Samuel Rubb who now called, and when Mrs\nBuggins told her lodger that he was in the parlour, she went down\nto see him willingly. Her life was now more desolate than it had\nbeen before the occurrence of that ceremony in the church of St\nMary-le-Strand; for, though she had much respect for Mr Buggins, of\nwhose character she had heard nothing that was not good, and though\nshe had given her consent as to the expediency of the Buggins'\nalliance, she did not find herself qualified to associate with Mr\nBuggins.\n\n\"He won't say a word, Miss,\" Hannah had pleaded, \"and he'll run and\nfetch for you like a dog.\"\n\nBut even when recommended so highly for his social qualities,\nBuggins, she felt, would be antipathetic to her; and, with many\nfalse assurances that she did not think it right to interrupt a\nnewly-married couple, she confined herself on those days to her own\nroom.\n\nBut when Mr Rubb came, she went down to see him. How much Mr\nRubb knew of her affairs,--how far he might be in Miss Colza's\nconfidence,--she did not know; but his conduct to her had not been\noffensive, and she had been pleased when she learned that the first\nhalf year's interest had been paid to her sister-in-law.\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear of all this, Miss Mackenzie,\" said he, when he\ncame forward to greet her. He had not thought it necessary, on this\noccasion, to put on his yellow gloves or his shiny boots, and she\nliked him the better on that account.\n\n\"Of all what, Mr Rubb?\" said she.\n\n\"Why, about you and the family at the Cedars. If what I hear is true,\nthey've just got you to give up everything, and then dropped you.\"\n\n\"I left Sir John Ball's house on my own account, Mr Rubb; I was not\nturned out.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose they'd do that. They wouldn't dare to do that; not\nso soon after getting hold of your money. Miss Mackenzie, I hope\nI shall not anger you; but it seems to me to be the most horridly\nwicked piece of business I ever heard of.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, Mr Rubb. You forget that the thing was first found\nout by my own lawyer.\"\n\n\"I don't know how that may be, but I can't bring myself to believe\nthat it all is as they say it is; I can't, indeed.\"\n\nShe merely smiled, and shook her head. Then he went on speaking.\n\n\"I hope I'm not giving offence. It's not what I mean, if I am.\"\n\n\"You are not giving any offence, Mr Rubb; only I think you are\nmistaken about my relatives at Twickenham.\"\n\n\"Of course, I may be; there's no doubt of that. I may be mistaken,\nlike another. But, Miss Mackenzie, by heavens, I can't bring myself\nto think it.\" As he spoke in this energetic way, he rose from his\nchair, and stood opposite to her. \"I cannot bring myself to think\nthat the fight should be given up.\"\n\n\"But there has been no fight.\"\n\n\"There ought to be a fight, Miss Mackenzie; I know that there ought.\nI believe I'm right in supposing, if all this is allowed to go by the\nboard as it is going, that you won't have, so to say, anything of\nyour own.\"\n\n\"I shall have to earn my bread like other people; and, indeed, I am\nendeavouring now to put myself in the way of doing so.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you how you shall earn it. Come and be my wife. I think\nwe've got a turn for good up at the business. Come and be my wife.\nThat's honest, any way.\"\n\n\"You are honest,\" said she, with a tear in her eye.\n\n\"I am honest now,\" said he, \"though I was not honest to you once;\"\nand I think there was a tear in his eye also.\n\n\"If you mean about that money that you have borrowed, I am very\nglad of it--very glad of it. It will be something for them in Gower\nStreet.\"\n\n\"Miss Mackenzie, as long as I have a hand to help myself with, they\nshall have that at least. But now, about this other thing. Whether\nthere's nothing to come or anything, I'll be true to my offer. I'll\nfight for it, if there's to be a fight, and I'll let it go if there's\nto be no fight. But whether one way or whether the other, there shall\nbe a home for you when you say the word. Say it now. Will you be my\nwife?\"\n\n\"I cannot say that word, Mr Rubb.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"I cannot say it; indeed, I cannot.\"\n\n\"Is it Mr Ball that prevents you?\"\n\n\"Do not ask me questions like that. Indeed, indeed, indeed, I cannot\ndo as you ask me.\"\n\n\"You despise me, like enough, because I am only a tradesman?\"\n\n\"What am I myself, that I should despise any man? No, Mr Rubb, I am\nthankful and grateful to you; but it cannot be.\"\n\nThen he took up his hat, and, turning away from her without any word\nof adieu, made his way out of the house.\n\n\"He really do seem a nice man, Miss,\" said Mrs Buggins. \"I wonder you\nwouldn't have him liefer than go into one of them hospitals.\"\n\nWhether Miss Mackenzie had any remnant left of another hope,\nor whether all such hope had gone, we need not perhaps inquire\naccurately. Whatever might be the state of her mind on that score,\nshe was doing her best to carry out her purpose with reference to the\nplan of nursing; and as she could not now apply to her cousin, she\nhad written to Mr Slow upon the subject.\n\nLate in November yet another gentleman came to see her, but when he\ncame she was unfortunately out. She had gone up to the house in Gower\nStreet, and had there been so cross-questioned by the indefatigable\nMiss Colza that she had felt herself compelled to tell her\nsister-in-law that she could not again come there as long as Miss\nColza was one of the family. It was manifest to her that these\nquestions had been put on behalf of Mr Maguire, and she had therefore\nfelt more indignant than she would have been had they originated in\nthe impertinent curiosity of the woman herself. She also informed\nMrs Mackenzie that, in obedience to instructions from Mr Slow, she\nintended to postpone her purpose with reference to the hospital till\nsome time early in the next year. Mr Slow had sent a clerk to her\nto explain that till that time such amicable arrangement as that to\nwhich he looked forward to make could not be completed. On her return\nfrom this visit to Gower Street she found the card,--simply the\ncard,--of her cousin, John Ball.\n\nWhy had she gone out? Why had she not remained a fixture in the\nhouse, seeing that it had always been possible that he should come?\nBut why! oh, why! had he treated her in this way, leaving his card\nat her home, as though that would comfort her in her grievous\ndesolation? It would have been far better that he should have left\nthere no intimation of his coming. She took the card, and in her\nanger threw it from her into the fire.\n\nBut yet she waited for him to come again. Not once during the next\nten days, excepting on the Sunday, did she go out of the house during\nthe hours that her cousin would be in London. Very sad and monotonous\nwas her life, passed alone in her own bedroom. And it was the more\nsad, because Mrs Buggins somewhat resented the manner in which her\nhusband was treated. Mrs Buggins was still attentive, but she made\nlittle speeches about Buggins' respectability, and Margaret felt that\nher presence in the house was an annoyance.\n\nAt last, at the end of the ten days, John Ball came again, and\nMargaret, with a fluttering heart, descended to meet him in the empty\nparlour.\n\nShe was the first to speak. As she had come downstairs, she had made\nup her mind to tell him openly what were her thoughts.\n\n\"I had hoped to have seen you before this, John,\" she said, as she\ngave him her hand.\n\n\"I did call before. Did you not get my card?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I got your card. But I had expected to see you before that.\nThe kind of life that I am leading here is very sad, and cannot be\nlong continued.\"\n\n\"I would have had you remain at the Cedars, Margaret; but you would\nnot be counselled by me.\"\n\n\"No; not in that, John.\"\n\n\"I only mention it now to excuse myself. But you are not to suppose\nthat I am not anxious about you, because I have not seen you. I have\nbeen with Mr Slow constantly. These law questions are always very\ntedious in being settled.\"\n\n\"But I want nothing for myself.\"\n\n\"It behoves Mr Slow, for that very reason, to be the more anxious on\nyour behalf; and, if you will believe me, Margaret, I am quite as\nanxious as he is. If you had remained with us, I could have discussed\nthe matter with you from day to day; but, of course, I cannot do so\nwhile you are here.\"\n\nAs he was talking in this way, everything with reference to their\npast intercourse came across her mind. She could not tell him that\nshe had been anxious to see him, not with reference to the money,\nbut that he might tell her that he did not find her guilty on that\ncharge which her aunt had brought against her concerning Mr Maguire.\nShe did not want assurances of solicitude as to her future means\nof maintenance. She cared little or nothing about her future\nmaintenance, if she could not get from him one kind word with\nreference to the past. But he went on talking to her about Mr Slow,\nand the interest, and the property, and the law, till, at last, in\nher anger, she told him that she did not care to hear further about\nit, till she should be told at last what she was to do.\n\n\"As I have got nothing of my own,\" she said, \"I want to be earning my\nbread, and I think that the delay is cruel.\"\n\n\"And do you think,\" said he, \"that the delay is not cruel to me\nalso?\"\n\nShe thought that he alluded to the fact that he could not yet obtain\npossession of the income for his own purposes.\n\n\"You may have it all at once, for me,\" she said.\n\n\"Have all what?\" he replied. \"Margaret, I think you fail to see the\ndifficulties of my position. In the first place, my father is on his\ndeathbed!\"\n\n\"Oh, John, I am sorry for that.\"\n\n\"And, then, my mother is very bitter about all this. And how can I,\nat such a time, tell her that her opinion is to go for nothing? I am\nbound to think of my own children, and cannot abandon my claim to the\nproperty.\"\n\n\"No one wants you to abandon it. At least, I do not.\"\n\n\"What am I to do, then? This Mr Maguire is making charges against\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh, John!\"\n\n\"He is saying that I am robbing you, and trying to cover the robbery\nby marrying you. Both my own lawyer, and Mr Slow, have told me that a\nplain statement of the whole case must be prepared, so that any one\nwho cares to inquire may learn the whole truth, before I can venture\nto do anything which might otherwise compromise my character. You\ndo not think of all this, Margaret, when you are angry with me.\"\nMargaret, hanging down her head, confessed that she had not thought\nof it.\n\n\"The difficulty would have been less, had you remained at the\nCedars.\"\n\nThen she again lifted her head, and told him that that would have\nbeen impossible. Let things go as they might, she knew that she had\nbeen right in leaving her aunt's house.\n\nThere was not much more said between them, nor did he give her any\ndefinite promise as to when he would see her again. He told her\nthat she might draw on Mr Slow for money if she wanted it, but that\nshe again declined. And he told her also not to withdraw Susanna\nMackenzie from her school at Littlebath--at any rate, not for\nthe present; and intimated also that Mr Slow would pay the\nschoolmistress's bill. Then he took his leave of her. He had spoken\nno word of love to her; but yet she felt, when he was gone, that her\ncase was not as hopeless now as it had seemed to be that morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nThe Little Story of the Lion and the Lamb\n\n\nDuring those three months of October, November, and December, Mr\nMaguire was certainly not idle. He had, by means of pertinacious\ninquiry, learned a good deal about Miss Mackenzie; indeed, he had\nlearned most of the facts which the reader knows, though not quite\nall of them. He had seen Jonathan Ball's will, and he had seen Walter\nMackenzie's will. He had ascertained, through Miss Colza, that John\nBall now claimed the property by some deed said to have been executed\nby Jonathan Ball previous to the execution of his will; and he\nhad also learned, from Miss Mackenzie's own lips, in Lady Ball's\npresence, that she had engaged herself to marry the man who was thus\nclaiming her property. Why should Mr Ball want to marry her,--who\nwould in such a case be penniless,--but that he felt himself\ncompelled in that way to quell all further inquiry into the thing\nthat he was doing? And why should she desire to marry him, but that\nin this way she might, as it were, go with her own property, and not\nlose the value of it herself when compelled to surrender it to her\ncousin? That she would have given herself, with all her property, to\nhim,--Maguire,--a few months ago, Mr Maguire felt fully convinced,\nand, as I have said before, had some ground for such conviction. He\nhad learned also from Miss Colza, that Miss Mackenzie had certainly\nquarrelled with Lady Ball, and that she had, so Miss Colza believed,\nbeen turned out of the house at the Cedars. Whether Mr Ball had or\nhad not abandoned his matrimonial prospects, Miss Colza could not\nquite determine. Having made up her mind to hate Miss Mackenzie, and\ntherefore, as was natural, thinking that no gentleman could really\nlike such \"a poor dowdy creature,\" she rather thought that he had\nabandoned his matrimonial prospects. Mr Maguire had thus learned much\non the subject; but he had not learned this:--that John Ball was\nhonest throughout in the matter, and that the lawyers employed in it\nwere honest also.\n\nAnd now, having got together all this information, and he himself\nbeing in a somewhat precarious condition as to his own affairs, Mr\nMaguire resolved upon using his information boldly. He had a not\nincorrect idea of the fitness of things, and did not fail to tell\nhimself that were he at that moment in possession of those clerical\nadvantages which his labours in the vineyard should have earned\nfor him, he would not have run the risk which he must undoubtedly\nincur by engaging himself in this matter. Had he a full church\nat Littlebath depending on him, had Mr Stumfold's chance and Mr\nStumfold's success been his, had he still even been an adherent of\nthe Stumfoldian fold, he would have paused before he rushed to the\npublic with an account of Miss Mackenzie's grievance. But as matters\nstood with him, looking round upon his own horizon, he did not\nsee that he had any course before him more likely to lead to good\npecuniary results, than this.\n\nThe reader has been told how Mr Maguire went to Arundel Street,\nand how he was there received. But that reception did not at all\ndaunt his courage. It showed him that the lady was still under the\nBall influence, and that his ally, Miss Colza, was probably wrong\nin supposing that the Ball marriage was altogether off. But this\nonly made him the more determined to undermine that influence, and\nto prevent that marriage. If he could once succeed in convincing\nthe lady that her best chance of regaining her fortune lay in his\nassistance, or if he could even convince her that his interference\nmust result, either with or without her good wishes, in dividing her\naltogether from the Ball alliance, then she would be almost compelled\nto throw herself into his arms. That she was violently in love with\nhim he did not suppose, nor did he think it at all more probable that\nshe should be violently in love with her cousin. He put her down\nin his own mind as one of those weak, good women, who can bring\nthemselves easily to love any man, and who are sure to make useful\nwives, because they understand so thoroughly the nature of obedience.\nIf he could secure for her her fortune, and could divide her from\nJohn Ball, he had but little doubt that she would come to him,\nin spite of the manner in which she had refused to receive him\nin Arundel Street. Having considered all this, after the mode of\nthinking which I have attempted to describe, he went to work with\nsuch weapons as were readiest to his hands.\n\nAs a first step, he wrote boldly to John Ball. In this letter\nhe reasserted the statement he had made to Lady Ball as to Miss\nMackenzie's engagement to himself, and added some circumstances\nwhich he had not mentioned to Lady Ball. He said, that having become\nengaged to that lady, he had, in consequence, given up his curacy\nat Littlebath, and otherwise so disarranged his circumstances, as\nto make it imperative upon him to take the steps which he was now\ntaking. He had come up to London, expecting to find her anxious\nto receive him in Gower Street, and had then discovered that she\nhad been taken away to the Cedars. He could not, he said, give any\nadequate description of his surprise, when, on arriving there, he\nheard from the mouth of his own Margaret that she was now engaged to\nher cousin. But if his surprise then had been great and terrible, how\nmuch greater and more terrible must it have been when, step by step,\nthe story of that claim upon her fortune revealed itself to him! He\npledged himself, in his letter, as a gentleman and as a Christian\nminister, to see the matter out. He would not allow Miss Mackenzie\nto be despoiled of her fortune and her hand,--both of which he had\na right to regard as his own,--without making known to the public a\ntransaction which he regarded as nefarious. Then there was a good\ndeal of eloquent indignation the nature and purport of which the\nreader will probably understand.\n\nMr Ball did not at all like this letter. He had that strong feeling\nof disinclination to be brought before the public with reference\nto his private affairs, which is common to all Englishmen; and\nhe specially had a dislike to this, seeing that there would be a\nquestion not only as to money, but also as to love. A gentleman does\nnot like to be accused of a dishonest attempt to possess himself of a\nlady's property; but, at the age of fifty, even that is almost better\nthan one which charges him with such attempt against a lady's heart.\nHe knew that he was not dishonest, and therefore could endure the\nfirst. He was not quite sure that he was not, or might not become,\nridiculous, and therefore feared the latter very greatly. He could\nnot ignore the letter, and there was nothing for it but to show it to\nhis lawyer. Unfortunately, he had told this lawyer, on the very day\nof Mr Maguire's visit to the Cedars, that all was to be made smooth\nby his marriage with Miss Mackenzie; and now, with much misery\nand many inward groanings, he had to explain all this story of Mr\nMaguire. It was the more painful in that he had to admit that an\noffer had been made to the lady by the clergyman, and had not been\nrejected.\n\n\"You don't think there was more than that?\" asked the lawyer, having\npaved the way for his question with sundry apologetic flourishes.\n\n\"I am sure there was not,\" said John Ball. \"She is as true as the\nGospel, and he is as false as the devil.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the lawyer; \"there's no doubt about his falsehood.\nHe's one of those fellows for whom nothing is too dirty. Clergymen\nare like women. As long as they're pure, they're a long sight purer\nthan other men; but when they fall, they sink deeper.\"\n\n\"You needn't be afraid of taking her word,\" said John Ball. \"If all\nwomen were as pure as she is, there wouldn't be much amiss with\nthem.\" His eyes glittered as he spoke of her, and it was a pity that\nMargaret could not have heard him then, and seen him there.\n\n\"You don't think she has been--just a little foolish, you know?\"\n\n\"I think she was very foolish in not bidding such a man to go about\nhis business, at once. But she has not been more so than what she\nowns. She is as brave as she is good, and I don't think she would\nkeep anything back.\"\n\nThe result was that a letter was written by the lawyer to Mr Maguire,\ntelling Mr Maguire that any further communication should be made\nto him; and also making a slight suggestion as to the pains and\npenalties which are incurred in the matter of a libel. Mr Maguire had\ndated his letter from Littlebath, and there the answer reached him.\nHe had returned thither, having found that he could take no further\nimmediate steps towards furthering his cause in London.\n\nAnd now, what steps should he take next? More than once he thought\nof putting his own case into the hands of a lawyer; but what was a\nlawyer to do for him? An action for breach of promise was open to\nhim, but he had wit enough to feel that there was very little chance\nof success for him in that line. He might instruct a lawyer to look\ninto Miss Mackenzie's affairs, and he thought it probable that he\nmight find a lawyer to take such instructions. But there would be\nmuch expense in this, and, probably, no result. Advancing logically\nfrom one conclusion to another, he at last resolved that he must rush\nboldly into print, and lay the whole iniquity of the transaction open\nto the public.\n\nHe believed--I think he did believe--that the woman was being\nwronged. Some particle of such belief he had, and fostering himself\nwith this, he sat himself down, and wrote a leading article.\n\nNow there existed in Littlebath at this time a weekly periodical\ncalled the _Christian Examiner_, with which Mr Maguire had for some\ntime had dealings. He had written for the paper, taking an earnest\npart in local religious subjects; and the paper, in return, had\nvery frequently spoken highly of Mr Maguire's eloquence, and of Mr\nMaguire's energy. There had been a give and take in this, which all\npeople understand who are conversant with the provincial, or perhaps\nI might add, with the metropolitan press of the country. The paper\nin question was not a wicked paper, nor were the gentlemen concerned\nin its publication intentionally scurrilous or malignant; but it was\nsubject to those great temptations which beset all class newspapers\nof the kind, and to avoid which seems to be almost more difficult, in\nhandling religious subjects, than in handling any other. The editor\nof a _Christian Examiner_, if, as is probable, he have, of his own,\nvery strong and one-sided religious convictions, will think that\nthose who differ from him are in a perilous way, and so thinking,\nwill feel himself bound to tell them so. The man who advocates one\nline of railway instead of another, or one prime minister as being\nsuperior to all others, does not regard his opponents as being\nfatally wrong,--wrong for this world and for the next,--and he can\nrestrain himself. But how is a newspaper writer to restrain himself\nwhen his opponent is incurring everlasting punishment, or, worse\nstill, carrying away others to a similar doom, in that they read, and\nperhaps even purchase, that which the lost one has written? In this\nway the contents of religious newspapers are apt to be personal;\nand heavy, biting, scorching attacks, become the natural vehicle of\n_Christian Examiners_.\n\nMr Maguire sat down and wrote his leading article, which on the\nfollowing Saturday appeared in all the glory of large type. The\narticle shall not be repeated here at length, because it contained\nsundry quotations from Holy Writ which may as well be omitted,\nbut the purport of it shall be explained. It commenced with a\ndissertation against an undue love of wealth,--the _auri sacra\nfames_, as the writer called it; and described with powerful unction\nthe terrible straits into which, when indulged, it led the vile,\nwicked, ugly, hideous, loathsome, devilish human heart. Then there\nwas an eloquent passage referring to worms and dust and grass, and\na quotation respecting treasures both corruptible and incorruptible.\nNot at once, but with crafty gradations, the author sloped away to\nthe point of his subject. How fearful was it to watch the way in\nwhich the strong, wicked ones,--the roaring lions of the earth,\nbeguiled the ignorance of the innocent, and led lonely lambs into\ntheir slaughter-houses. All this, much amplified, made up half\nthe article; and then, after the manner of a pleasant relater of\nanecdotes, the clerical story-teller began his little tale. When,\nhowever, he came to the absolute writing of the tale, he found it\nto be prudent for the present to omit the names of his hero and\nheroine--to omit, indeed, the names of all the persons concerned. He\nhad first intended boldly to dare it all, and perhaps would yet have\ndone so had he been quite sure of his editor. But his editor he found\nmight object to these direct personalities at the first sound of the\ntrumpet, unless the communication were made in the guise of a letter,\nwith Mr Maguire's name at the end of it. After a while the editor\nmight become hot in the fight himself, and then the names could\nbe blazoned forth. And there existed some chance,--some small\nchance,--that the robber-lion, John Ball, might be induced to drop\nhis lamb from his mouth when he heard this premonitory blast, and\nthen the lion's prey might be picked up by--\"the bold hunter,\" Mr\nMaguire would probably have said, had he been called upon to finish\nthe sentence himself; anyone else might, perhaps, say, by the jackal.\nThe little story was told, therefore, without the mention of any\nnames. Mr Maguire had read other little stories told in another\nway in other newspapers, of greater weight, no doubt, than the\nLittlebath _Christian Examiner_, and had thought that he could\nwield a thunderbolt as well as any other Jupiter; but in wielding\nthunderbolts, as in all other operations of skill, a man must first\ntry his 'prentice hand with some reticence; and thus he reconciled\nhimself to prudence, not without some pangs of conscience which\naccused him inwardly of cowardice.\n\n\"Not long ago there was a lady in this town, loved and respected by\nall who knew her.\" Thus he began, and then gave a not altogether\ninaccurate statement of the whole affair, dropping, of course, his\nown share in the concern, and accusing the vile, wicked, hideous,\nloathsome human heart of the devouring lion, who lived some miles\nto the west end of London, of a brutal desire and a hellish scheme\nto swallow up the inheritance of the innocent, loved, and respected\nlamb, in spite of the closest ties of consanguinity between them. And\nthen he went on to tell how, with a base desire of covering up from\nthe eyes of an indignant public his bestial greediness in having made\nthis dishonest meal, the lion had proposed to himself the plan of\nmarrying the lamb! It was a pity that Maguire had not learned--that\nMiss Colza had not been able to tell him--that the lion had once\nbefore expressed his wish to take the lamb for his wife. Had he\nknown that, what a picture he would have drawn of the disappointed\nvindictive king of the forest, as lying in his lair at Twickenham he\nmeditated his foul revenge! This unfortunately was unknown to Mr\nMaguire and unsuspected by him.\n\nBut the article did not end here. The indignant writer of it went on\nto say that he had buckled on his armour in support of the lamb, and\nthat he was ready to meet the lion either in the forest or in any\nsocial circle; either in the courts of law or before any Christian\narbitrator. With loud trumpetings, he summoned the lion to appear and\nplead guilty, or to stand forward, if he dared, and declare himself\ninnocent with his hand on his heart. If the lion could prove himself\nto be innocent the writer of that article offered him the right hand\nof fellowship, an offer which the lion would not, perhaps, regard\nas any strong inducement; but if the lion were not innocent--if, as\nthe writer of that article was well aware was the case, the lion was\nbasely, greedily, bestially guilty, then the writer of that article\npledged himself to give the lion no peace till he had disgorged his\nprey, and till the lamb was free to come back, with all her property,\nto that Christian circle in Littlebath which had loved her so warmly\nand respected her so thoroughly.\n\nSuch was the nature of the article, and the editor put it in. After\nall, what, in such matters, is an editor to do? Is it not his\nbusiness to sell his paper? And if the editor of a _Christian\nExaminer_ cannot trust the clergyman he has sat under, whom can he\ntrust? Some risk an editor is obliged to run, or he will never sell\nhis paper. There could be little doubt that such an article as this\nwould be popular among the religious world of Littlebath, and that it\nwould create a demand. He had his misgivings--had that poor editor.\nHe did not feel quite sure of his lion and his lamb. He talked the\nmatter over vehemently with Mr Maguire in the little room in which\nhe occupied himself with his scissors and his paste; but ultimately\nthe article was inserted. Who does not know that interval of triumph\nwhich warms a man's heart when he has delivered his blow, and\nthe return blow has not been yet received? The blow has been so\nwell struck that it must be successful, nay, may probably be\ndeath-dealing. So felt Mr Maguire when two dozen copies of the\n_Christian Examiner_ were delivered at his lodgings on the Saturday\nmorning. The article, though printed as a leading article, had been\nheaded as a little story,--\"The Lion and the Lamb,\"--so that it might\nmore readily attract attention. It read very nicely in print. It\nhad all that religious unction which is so necessary for _Christian\nExaminers_, and with it that spice of devilry, so delicious to\nhumanity that without it even _Christian Examiners_ cannot be made\nto sell themselves. He was very busy with his two dozen damp copies\nbefore him,--two dozen which had been sent to him, by agreement, as\nthe price of his workmanship. He made them up and directed them with\nhis own hand. To the lion and the lamb he sent two copies, two to\neach. To Mr Slow he sent a copy, and another to Messrs Slow and\nBideawhile, and a third to the other lawyer. He sent a copy to Lady\nBall and one to Sir John. Another he sent to the old Mackenzie,\nbaronet at Incharrow, and two more to the baronet's eldest son, and\nthe baronet's eldest son's wife. A copy he sent to Mrs Tom Mackenzie,\nand a copy to Miss Colza; and a copy also he sent to Mrs Buggins.\nAnd he sent a copy to the Chairman of the Board at the Shadrach Fire\nOffice, and another to the Chairman at the Abednego Life Office. A\ncopy he sent to Mr Samuel Rubb, junior, and a copy to Messrs Rubb and\nMackenzie. Out of his own pocket he supplied the postage stamps, and\nwith his own hand he dropped the papers into the Littlebath\npost-office.\n\nPoor Miss Mackenzie, when she read the article, was stricken almost\nto the ground. How she did hate the man whose handwriting on the\naddress she recognised at once! What should she do? In her agony\nshe almost resolved that she would start at once for the Cedars and\nprofess her willingness to go before all the magistrates in London\nand Littlebath, and swear that her cousin was no lion and that she\nwas no lamb. At that moment her feelings towards the Christians\nand _Christian Examiners_ of Littlebath were not the feelings of\na Griselda. I think she could have spoken her mind freely had Mr\nMaguire come in her way. Then, when she saw Mrs Buggins's copy, her\nanger blazed up afresh, and her agony became more intense. The horrid\nman must have sent copies all over the world, or he would never have\nthought of sending a copy to Mrs Buggins!\n\nBut she did not go to the Cedars. She reflected that when there she\nmight probably find her cousin absent, and in such case she would\nhardly know how to address herself to her aunt. Mr Ball, too, might\nperhaps come to her, and for three days she patiently awaited his\ncoming. On the evening of the third day there came to her, not Mr\nBall, but a clerk from Mr Slow, the same clerk who had been with her\nbefore, and he made an appointment with her at Mr Slow's office on\nthe following morning. She was to meet Mr Ball there, and also to\nmeet Mr Ball's lawyer. Of course she consented to go, and of course\nshe was on Mr Slow's staircase exactly at the time appointed. Of what\nshe was thinking as she walked round Lincoln's Inn Fields to kill a\nquarter of an hour which she found herself to have on hand, we will\nnot now inquire.\n\nShe was shown at once into Mr Slow's room, and the first thing that\nmet her eyes was a copy of that horrible _Christian Examiner_, lying\non the table before him. She knew it instantly, and would have known\nit had she simply seen a corner of the printing. To her eyes and\nto her mind, no other printed paper had ever been so ugly and so\nvicious. But she saw that there was also another newspaper under the\n_Christian Examiner_. Mr Slow brought her to the fire, and gave her\na chair, and was very courteous. In a few moments came the other\nlawyer, and with him came John Ball.\n\nMr Slow opened the conference, all the details of which need not be\ngiven here. He first asked Miss Mackenzie whether she had seen that\nwicked libel. She, with much energy and, I may almost say, with\nvirulence, declared that the horrid paper had been sent to her. She\nhoped that nobody suspected that she had known anything about it.\nIn answer to this, they all assured her that she need not trouble\nherself on that head. Mr Slow then told her that a London paper had\ncopied the whole story of the \"Lion and the Lamb,\" expressing a hope\nthat the lion would be exposed if there was any truth in it, and the\nwriter would be exposed if there was none.\n\n\"The writer was Mr Maguire, a clergyman,\" said Miss Mackenzie, with\nindignation.\n\n\"We all know that,\" said Mr Slow, with a slight smile on his face.\nThen he went on reading the remarks of the London paper, which\ndeclared that the Littlebath _Christian Examiner_, having gone so\nfar, must, of necessity, go further. The article was calculated to\ngive the greatest pain to, no doubt, many persons; and the innocence\nor guilt of \"the Lion,\" as poor John Ball was called, must be made\nmanifest to the public.\n\n\"And now, my dear Miss Mackenzie, I will tell you what we propose to\ndo,\" said Mr Slow. He then explained that it was absolutely necessary\nthat a question of law should be tried and settled in a court of\nlaw, between her and her cousin. When she protested against this, he\nendeavoured to explain to her that the cause would be an amicable\ncause, a simple reference, in short, to a legal tribunal. Of course,\nshe did not understand this, and, of course, she still protested; but\nafter a while, when she began to perceive that her protest was of no\navail, she let that matter drop. The cause should be brought on as\nsoon as possible, but could not be decided till late in the spring.\nShe was told that she had better make no great change in her own\nmanner of life till that time, and was again informed that she could\nhave what money she wanted for her own maintenance. She refused to\ntake any money: but when the reference was made to some proposed\nchange in her life, she looked wistfully into her cousin's face. He,\nhowever, had nothing to say then, and kept his eyes intently fixed\nupon the carpet.\n\nMr Slow then took up the _Christian Examiner_, and declared to her\nwhat was their intention with reference to that. A letter should\nbe written from his house to the editor of the London newspaper,\ngiving a plain statement of the case, with all the names, explaining\nthat all the parties were acting in perfect concert, and that the\nmatter was to be decided in the only way which could be regarded as\nsatisfactory. In answer to this, Miss Mackenzie, almost in tears,\npointed out how distressing would be the publicity thus given to her\nname \"particularly\"--she said, \"particularly--\" But she could not go\non with the expression of her thoughts, or explain that so public a\nreference to a proposal of marriage from her cousin must be doubly\npainful to her, seeing that the idea of such a marriage had been\nabandoned. But Mr Slow understood all this, and, coming over to her,\ntook her gently by the hand.\n\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"you may trust me in this as though I were your\nfather. I know that such publicity is painful; but, believe me, it is\nthe best that we can do.\"\n\nOf course she had no alternative but to yield.\n\nWhen the interview was over, her cousin walked home with her to\nArundel Street, and said much to her as to the necessity for this\ntrial. He said so much, that she, at last, dimly understood that\nthe matter could not be set at rest by her simple renouncing of the\nproperty. Her own lawyer could not allow her to do so; nor could he,\nJohn Ball, consent to receive the property in such a manner. \"You\nsee, by that newspaper, what people would say of me.\"\n\nBut had he not the power of making everything easy by doing that\nwhich he himself had before proposed to do? Why did he not again say,\n\"Margaret, come and be my wife?\" She acknowledged to herself that he\nhad a right to act as though he had never said those words,--that the\nfacts elicited by Mr Maguire's visit to the Cedars were sufficient to\nabsolve him from his offer. But yet she thought that they should have\nbeen sufficient also to induce him to renew it.\n\nOn that occasion, when he left her at the door in Arundel Street, he\nhad not renewed his offer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nLady Ball in Arundel Street\n\n\nOn Christmas Day Miss Mackenzie was pressed very hard to eat her\nChristmas dinner with Mr and Mrs Buggins, and she almost gave way.\nShe had some half-formed idea in her head that should she once\nsit down to table with Buggins, she would have given up the fight\naltogether. She had no objection to Buggins, and had, indeed, no\nstrong objection to put herself on a par with Buggins; but she felt\nthat she could not be on a par with Buggins and with John Ball at\nthe same time. Why it should be that in associating with the man\nshe would take a step downwards, and might yet associate with the\nman's wife without taking any step downwards, she did not attempt to\nexplain to herself. But I think that she could have explained it had\nshe put herself to the task of analysing the question, and that she\nfelt exactly the result of such analysis without making it. At any\nrate, she refused the invitation persistently, and ate her wretched\ndinner alone in her bedroom.\n\nShe had often told herself, in those days of her philosophy at\nLittlebath, that she did not care to be a lady; and she told herself\nnow the same thing very often when she was thinking of the hospital.\nShe cosseted herself with no false ideas as to the nature of the work\nwhich she proposed to undertake. She knew very well that she might\nhave to keep rougher company than that of Buggins if she put her\nshoulder to that wheel. She was willing enough to do this, and had\nbeen willing to encounter such company ever since she left the\nCedars. She was prepared for the roughness. But she would not put\nherself beyond the pale, as it were, of her cousin's hearth, moved\nsimply by a temptation to relieve the monotony of her life. When the\nwork came within her reach she would go to it, but till then she\nwould bear the wretchedness of her dull room upstairs. She wondered\nwhether he ever thought how wretched she must be in her solitude.\n\nOn New Year's Day she heard that her uncle was dead. She was already\nin mourning for her brother, and was therefore called upon to make no\nchange in that respect. She wrote a note of condolence to her aunt,\nin which she strove much, and vainly, to be cautious and sympathetic\nat the same time, and in return received a note, in which Lady Ball\ndeclared her purpose of coming to Arundel Street to see her niece as\nsoon as she found herself able to leave the house. She would, she\nsaid, give Margaret warning the day beforehand, as it would be very\nsad if she had her journey all for nothing.\n\nHer aunt, Lady Ball, was coming to see her in Arundel Street! What\ncould be the purpose of such a visit after all that had passed\nbetween them? And why should her aunt trouble herself to make it\nat a period of such great distress? Lady Ball must have some very\nimportant plan to propose, and poor Margaret's heart was in a\nflutter. It was ten days after this before the second promised note\narrived, and then Margaret was asked to say whether she would be at\nhome and able to receive her aunt's visit at ten minutes past two on\nthe day but one following. Margaret wrote back to say that she would\nbe at home at ten minutes past two on the day named.\n\nHer aunt was old, and she again borrowed the parlour, though she was\nnot now well inclined to ask favours from Mrs Buggins. Mrs Buggins\nhad taken to heart the slight put upon her husband, and sometimes\nmade nasty little speeches.\n\n\"Oh dear, yes, in course, Miss Margaret; not that I ever did think\nmuch of them Ballses, and less than ever now, since the gentleman was\nkind enough to send me the newspaper. But she's welcome to the room,\nseeing as how Mr Tiddy will be in the City, of course; and you're\nwelcome to it, too, though you do keep yourself so close to yourself,\nwhich won't ever bring you round to have your money again; that it\nwon't.\"\n\nLady Ball came and was shown into the parlour, and her niece went\ndown to receive her.\n\n\"I would have been here before you came, aunt, only the room is not\nmine.\"\n\nIn answer to this, Lady Ball said that it did very well. Any room\nwould answer the present purpose. Then she sat down on the sofa from\nwhich she had risen. She was dressed, of course, in the full weeds\nof her widowhood, and the wide extent of her black crape was almost\nawful in Margaret's eyes. She did not look to be so savage as her\nniece had sometimes seen her, but there was about her a ponderous\naccumulation of crape, which made her even more formidable than she\nused to be. It would be almost impossible to refuse anything to a\nperson so black, so grave, so heavy, and so big.\n\n\"I have come to you, my dear,\" she said, \"as soon as I possibly could\nafter the sad event which we have had at home.\"\n\nIn answer to this, Margaret said that she was much obliged, but she\nhoped that her aunt had put herself to no trouble. Then she said a\nword or two about her uncle,--a word or two that was very difficult,\nas of course it could mean nothing.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the widow, \"he has been taken from us after a long and\nuseful life. I hope his son will always show himself to be worthy of\nsuch a father.\"\n\nAfter that there was silence in the room for a minute or two, during\nwhich Margaret waited for her aunt to begin; but Lady Ball sat\nthere solid, grave, and black, as though she thought that her very\npresence, without any words, might be effective upon Margaret as a\npreliminary mode of attack. Margaret herself could find nothing to\nsay to her aunt, and she, therefore, also remained silent. Lady Ball\nwas so far successful in this, that when three minutes were over her\nniece had certainly been weakened by the oppressive nature of the\nmeeting. She had about her less of vivacity, and perhaps also less of\nvitality, than when she first entered the room.\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" said her aunt at last, \"there are things, you know,\nwhich must be talked about, though they are ever so disagreeable;\"\nand then she pulled out of her pocket that abominable number of the\nLittlebath _Christian Examiner_.\n\n\"Oh, aunt, I hope you are not going to talk about that.\"\n\n\"My dear, that is cowardly; it is, indeed. How am I to help talking\nabout it? I have come here, from Twickenham, on purpose to talk about\nit.\"\n\n\"Then, aunt, I must decline; I must, indeed.\"\n\n\"My dear!\"\n\n\"I must, indeed, aunt.\"\n\nLet a man or a woman's vitality be ever so thoroughly crushed and\nquenched by fatigue or oppression--or even by black crape--there will\nalways be some mode of galvanising which will restore it for a time,\nsome specific either of joy or torture which will produce a return\nof temporary energy. This Littlebath newspaper was a battery of\nsufficient power to put Margaret on her legs again, though she\nperhaps might not be long able to keep them.\n\n\"It is a vile, lying paper, and it was written by a vile, lying man,\nand I hope you will put it up and say nothing about it.\"\n\n\"It is a vile, lying paper, Margaret; but the lies are against my\nson, and not against you.\"\n\n\"He is a man, and knows what he is about, and it does not signify to\nhim. But, aunt, I won't talk about it, and there's an end of it.\"\n\n\"I hope he does know what he is about,\" said Lady Ball. \"I hope he\ndoes. But you, as you say, are a woman, and therefore it specially\nbehoves you to know what you are about.\"\n\n\"I am not doing anything to anybody,\" said Margaret.\n\nLady Ball had now refolded the offensive newspaper, and restored it\nto her pocket. Perhaps she had done as much with it as she had from\nthe first intended. At any rate, she brought it forth no more, and\nmade no further intentionally direct allusion to it. \"I don't suppose\nyou really wish to do any injury to anybody,\" she said.\n\n\"Does anybody accuse me of doing them an injury?\" Margaret asked.\n\n\"Well, my dear, if I were to say that I accused you, perhaps you\nwould misunderstand me. I hope--I thoroughly expect, that before I\nleave you, I may be able to say that I do not accuse you. If you\nwill only listen to me patiently for a few minutes, Margaret--which\nI couldn't get you to do, you know, before you went away from the\nCedars in that very extraordinary manner--I think I can explain to\nyou something which--\" Here Lady Ball became embarrassed, and paused;\nbut Margaret gave her no assistance, and therefore she began a new\nsentence. \"In point of fact, I want you to listen to what I say, and\nthen, I think--I do think--you will do as we would have you.\"\n\nWhom did she include in that word \"we\"? Margaret had still sufficient\nvitality not to let the word pass by unquestioned. \"You mean yourself\nand John?\" said she.\n\n\"I mean the family,\" said Lady Ball rather sharply. \"I mean the\nwhole family, including those dear girls to whom I have been in the\nposition of a mother since my son's wife died. It is in the name of\nthe Ball family that I now speak, and surely I have a right.\"\n\nMargaret thought that Lady Ball had no such right, but she would not\nsay so at that moment.\n\n\"Well, Margaret, to come to the point at once, the fact is this. You\nmust renounce any idea that you may still have of becoming my son's\nwife.\" Then she paused.\n\n\"Has John sent you here to say this?\" demanded Margaret.\n\n\"I don't wish you to ask any such question as that. If you had any\nreal regard for him I don't think you would ask it. Consider his\ndifficulties, and consider the position of those poor children! If he\nwere your brother, would you advise him, at his age, to marry a woman\nwithout a farthing, and also to incur the certain disgrace which\nwould attach to his name after--after all that has been said about\nit in this newspaper?\"--then, Lady Ball put her hand upon her\npocket--\"in this newspaper, and in others?\"\n\nThis was more than Margaret could bear. \"There would be no disgrace,\"\nsaid she, jumping to her feet.\n\n\"Margaret, if you put yourself into a passion, how can you understand\nreason? You ought to know, yourself, by the very fact of your being\nin a passion, that you are wrong. Would there be no disgrace, after\nall that has come out about Mr Maguire?\"\n\n\"No, none--none!\" almost shouted this modern Griselda. \"There could\nbe no disgrace. I won't admit it. As for his marrying me, I don't\nexpect it. There is nothing to bind him to me. If he doesn't come\nto me I certainly shall not go to him. I have looked upon it as all\nover between him and me; and as I have not troubled him with any\nimportunities, nor yet you, it is cruel in you to come to me in this\nway. He is free to do what he likes--why don't you go to him? But\nthere would be no disgrace.\"\n\n\"Of course he is free. Of course such a marriage never can take place\nnow. It is quite out of the question. You say that it is all over,\nand you are quite right. Why not let this be settled in a friendly\nway between you and me, so that we might be friends again? I should\nbe so glad to help you in your difficulties if you would agree with\nme about this.\"\n\n\"I want no help.\"\n\n\"Margaret, that is nonsense. In your position you are very wrong to\nset your natural friends at defiance. If you will only authorise me\nto say that you renounce this marriage--\"\n\n\"I will not renounce it,\" said Margaret, who was still standing up.\n\"I will not renounce it. I would sooner lose my tongue than let\nit say such a word. You may tell him, if you choose to tell him\nanything, that I demand nothing from him; nothing. All that I once\nthought mine is now his, and I demand nothing from him. But when he\nasked me to be his wife he told me to be firm, and in that I will\nobey him. He may renounce me, and I shall have nothing with which to\nreproach him; but I will never renounce him--never.\" And then the\nmodern Griselda, who had been thus galvanised into vitality, stood\nover her aunt in a mood that was almost triumphant.\n\n\"Margaret, I am astonished at you,\" said Lady Ball, when she had\nrecovered herself.\n\n\"I can't help that, aunt.\"\n\n\"And now let me tell you this. My son is, of course, old enough to\ndo as he pleases. If he chooses to ruin himself and his children by\nmarrying, anybody--even if it were out of the streets--I can't help\nit. Stop a moment and hear me to the end.\" This she said, as her\nniece had made a movement as though towards the door. \"I say, even\nif it were out of the streets, I couldn't help it. But nothing shall\ninduce me to live in the same house with him if he marries you. It\nwill be on your conscience for ever that you have brought ruin on the\nwhole family, and that will be your punishment. As for me, I shall\ntake myself off to some solitude, and--there--I--shall--die.\" Then\nLady Ball put her handkerchief up to her face and wept copiously.\n\nMargaret stood still, leaning upon the table, but she spoke no word,\neither in answer to the threat or to the tears. Her immediate object\nwas to take herself out of the room, but this she did not know how to\nachieve. At last her aunt spoke again: \"If you please, I will get you\nto ask your landlady to send for a cab.\" Then the cab was procured,\nand Buggins, who had come home for his dinner, handed her ladyship\nin. Not a word had been spoken during the time that the cab was being\nfetched, and when Lady Ball went down the passage, she merely said,\n\"I wish you good-bye, Margaret.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Margaret, and then she escaped to her own bedroom.\n\nLady Ball had not done her work well. It was not within her power to\ninduce Margaret to renounce her engagement, and had she known her\nniece better, I do not think that she would have made the attempt.\nShe did succeed in learning that Margaret had received no renewal\nof an offer from her son,--that there was, in fact, no positive\nengagement now existing between them; and with this, I think, she\nshould have been satisfied. Margaret had declared that she demanded\nnothing from her cousin, and with this assurance Lady Ball should\nhave been contented. But she had thought to carry her point, to\nobtain the full swing of her will, by means of a threat, and had\nforgotten that in the very words of her own menace she conveyed to\nMargaret some intimation that her son was still desirous of doing\nthat very thing which she was so anxious to prevent. There was no\nchance that her threat should have any effect on Margaret. She ought\nto have known that the tone of the woman's mind was much too firm\nfor that. Margaret knew--was as sure of it as any woman could be\nsure--that her cousin was bound to her by all ties of honour. She\nbelieved, too, that he was bound to her by love, and that if he\nshould finally desert it, he would be moved to do so by mean motives.\nIt was no anger on the score of Mr Maguire that would bring him to\nsuch a course, no suspicion that she was personally unworthy of\nbeing his wife. Our Griselda, with all her power of suffering and\nwillingness to suffer, understood all that, and was by no means\ndisposed to give way to any threat from Lady Ball.\n\nWhen she was upstairs, and once more in solitude, she disgraced\nherself again by crying. She could be strong enough when attacked by\nothers, but could not be strong when alone. She cried and sobbed upon\nher bed, and then, rising, looked at herself in the glass, and told\nherself that she was old and ugly, and fitted only for that hospital\nnursing of which she had been thinking. But still there was something\nabout her heart that bore her up. Lady Ball would not have come to\nher, would not have exercised her eloquence upon her, would not have\ncalled upon her to renounce this engagement, had she not found all\nsimilar attempts upon her own son to be ineffectual. Could it then\nbe so, that, after all, her cousin would be true to her? If it were\nso, if it could be so, what would she not do for him and for his\nchildren? If it were so, how blessed would have been all these\ntroubles that had brought her to such a haven at last! Then she tried\nto reconcile his coldness to her with that which she so longed to\nbelieve might be the fact. She was not to expect him to be a lover\nsuch as are young men. Was she young herself, or would she like him\nbetter if he were to assume anything of youth in his manners? She\nunderstood that life with him was a serious thing, and that it was\nhis duty to be serious and grave in what he did. It might be that it\nwas essential to his character, after all that had passed, that the\nquestion of the property should be settled finally, before he could\ncome to her, and declare his wishes. Thus flattering herself, she put\naway from her her tears, and dressed herself, smoothing her hair, and\nwashing away the traces of her weeping; and then again she looked at\nherself in the glass to see if it were possible that she might be\ncomely in his eyes.\n\nThe months of January and February slowly wore themselves away, and\nduring the whole of that time Margaret saw her cousin but once, and\nthen she met him at Mr Slow's chambers. She had gone there to sign\nsome document, and there she had found him. She had then been told\nthat she would certainly lose her cause. No one who had looked into\nthe matter had any doubt of that. It certainly was the case that\nJonathan Ball had bequeathed property which was not his at the\ntime he made the will, but which at the time of his death, in fact,\nabsolutely belonged to his nephew, John Ball. Old Mr Slow, as he\nexplained this now for the seventh or eighth time, did it without a\ntone of regret in his voice, or a sign of sorrow in his eye. Margaret\nhad become so used to the story now, that it excited no strong\nfeelings within her. Her wish, she said, was, that the matter should\nbe settled. The lawyer, with almost a smile on his face, but still\nshaking his head, said that he feared it could not be settled before\nthe end of April. John Ball sat by, leaning his face, as usual, upon\nhis umbrella, and saying nothing. It did, for a moment, strike Miss\nMackenzie as singular, that she should be reduced from affluence to\nabsolute nothingness in the way of property, in so very placid a\nmanner. Mr Slow seemed to be thinking that he was, upon the whole,\ndoing rather well for his client.\n\n\"Of course you understand, Miss Mackenzie, that you can have any\nmoney you require for your present personal wants.\"\n\nThis had been said to her so often, that she took it as one of Mr\nSlow's legal formulas, which meant nothing to the laity.\n\nOn that occasion also Mr Ball walked home with her, and was very\neloquent about the law's delays. He also seemed to speak as though\nthere was nothing to be regretted by anybody, except the fact that he\ncould not get possession of the property as quick as he wished. He\nsaid not a word of anything else, and Margaret, of course, submitted\nto be talked to by him rather than to talk herself. Of Lady Ball's\nvisit he said not a word, nor did she. She asked after the children,\nand especially after Jack. One word she did say:\n\n\"I had hoped Jack would have come to see me at my lodgings.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he had better not,\" said Jack's father, \"till all is\nsettled. We have had much to trouble us at home since my father's\ndeath.\"\n\nThen of course she dropped that subject. She had been greatly\nstartled on that day on hearing her cousin called Sir John by Mr\nSlow. Up to that moment it had never occurred to her that the man of\nwhom she was so constantly thinking as her possible husband was a\nbaronet. To have been Mrs Ball seemed to her to have been possible;\nbut that she should become Lady Ball was hardly possible. She wished\nthat he had not been called Sir John. It seemed to her to be almost\nnatural that people should be convinced of the impropriety of such a\none as her becoming the wife of a baronet.\n\nDuring this period she saw her sister-in-law once or twice, who on\nthose occasions came down to Arundel Street. She herself would not go\nto Gower Street, because of the presence of Miss Colza. Miss Colza\nstill continued to live there, and still continued very much in\narrear in her contributions to the household fund. Mrs Mackenzie did\nnot turn her out, because she would,--so she said,--in such case get\nnothing. Mrs Tom was by this time quite convinced that the property\nwould, either justly or unjustly, go into the hands of John Ball, and\nshe was therefore less anxious to make any sacrifice to please her\nsister-in-law.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't see why you should be so bitter against her,\" said\nMrs Tom. \"I don't suppose she told the clergyman a word that wasn't\ntrue.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie declined to discuss the subject, and assured Mrs Tom\nthat she only recommended the banishment of Miss Colza because of her\napparent unwillingness to pay.\n\n\"As for the money,\" said Mrs Tom, \"I expect Mr Rubb to see to that. I\nsuppose he intends to make her Mrs Rubb sooner or later.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie, having some kindly feeling towards Mr Rubb, would\nhave preferred to hear that Miss Colza was likely to become Mrs\nMaguire. During these visits, Mrs Tom got more than one five-pound\nnote from her sister-in-law, pleading the difficulty she had in\nprocuring breakfast for lodgers without any money for the baker.\nMargaret protested against these encroachments, but, still, the money\nwould be forthcoming.\n\nOnce, towards the end of February, Mrs Buggins seduced her lodger\ndown into her parlour in the area, and Miss Mackenzie thought she\nperceived that something of the old servant's manners had returned to\nher. She was more respectful than she had been of late, and made no\nattempts at smart, ill-natured speeches.\n\n\"It's a weary life, Miss, this you're living here, isn't it?\" said\nshe.\n\nMargaret said that it was weary, but that there could be no change\ntill the lawsuit should be settled. It would be settled, she hoped,\nin April.\n\n\"Bother it for a lawsuit,\" said Mrs Buggins. \"They all tells me that\nit ain't any lawsuit at all, really.\"\n\n\"It's an amicable lawsuit,\" said Miss Mackenzie.\n\n\"I never see such amicableness! 'Tis a wonder to hear, Miss, how\neverybody is talking about it everywheres. Where we was last\nnight--that is, Buggins and I--most respectable people in the copying\nline--it isn't only he as does the copying, but she too; nurses the\nbaby, and minds the kitchen fire, and goes on, sheet after sheet, all\nat the same time; and a very tidy thing they make of it, only they do\nstraggle their words so;--well, they were saying as it's one of the\nmost remarkablest cases as ever was know'd.\"\n\n\"I don't see that I shall be any the better because it's talked\nabout.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Margaret, I'm not so sure of that. It's my belief that if\none only gets talked about enough, one may have a'most anything one\nchooses to ask for.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to ask for anything.\"\n\n\"But if what we heard last night is all true, there's somebody else\nthat does want to ask for something, or, as has asked, as folks say.\"\n\nMargaret blushed up to the eyes, and then protested that she did not\nknow what Mrs Buggins meant.\n\n\"I never dreamed of it, my dear; indeed, I didn't, when the old lady\ncome here with her tantrums; but now, it's as plain as a pikestaff.\nIf I'd a' known anything about that, my dear, I shouldn't have made\nso free about Buggins; indeed, I shouldn't.\"\n\n\"You're talking nonsense, Mrs Buggins; indeed, you are.\"\n\n\"They have the whole story all over the town at any rate, and in the\nlane, and all about the courts; and they declare it don't matter a\ntoss of a halfpenny which way the matter goes, as you're to become\nLady Ball the very moment the case is settled.\"\n\nMiss Mackenzie protested that Mrs Buggins was a stupid woman,--the\nstupidest woman she had ever heard or seen; and then hurried up into\nher own room to hug herself in her joy, and teach herself to believe\nthat what so many people said must at last come true.\n\nThree days after this, a very fine, private carriage, with two\nservants on a hammer cloth, drove up to the door in Arundel Street,\nand the maid-servant, hurrying upstairs, told Miss Mackenzie that\na beautifully-dressed lady downstairs was desirous of seeing her\nimmediately.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nMrs Mackenzie of Cavendish Square\n\n\n\"My dear,\" said the beautifully-dressed lady, \"you don't know me, I\nthink;\" and the beautifully-dressed lady came up to Miss Mackenzie\nvery cordially, took her by the hand, smiled upon her, and seemed to\nbe a very good-natured person indeed. Margaret told the lady that\nshe did not know her, and at that moment was altogether at a loss to\nguess who the lady might be. The lady might be forty years of age,\nbut was still handsome, and carried with her that easy, self-assured,\nwell balanced manner, which, if it be not overdone, goes so far to\nmake up for beauty, if beauty itself be wanting.\n\n\"I am your cousin, Mrs Mackenzie,--Clara Mackenzie. My husband\nis Walter Mackenzie, and his father is Sir Walter Mackenzie, of\nIncharrow. Now you will know all about me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I know you,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"I ought, I suppose, to make ever so many apologies for not coming to\nyou before; but I did call upon you, ever so long ago; I forget when,\nand after that you went to live at Littlebath. And then we heard of\nyou as being with Lady Ball, and for some reason, which I don't quite\nunderstand, it has always been supposed that Lady Ball and I were not\nto know each other. And now I have heard this wonderful story about\nyour fortune, and about everything else, too, my dear; and it seems\nall very beautiful, and very romantic; and everybody says that you\nhave behaved so well; and so, to make a long story short, I have come\nto find you out in your hermitage, and to claim cousinship, and all\nthat sort of thing.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'm very much obliged to you, Mrs Mackenzie--\"\n\n\"Don't say it in that way, my dear, or else you'll make me think you\nmean to turn a cold shoulder on me for not coming to you before.\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"But we've only just come to town; and though of course I heard the\nstory down in Scotland--\"\n\n\"Did you?\"\n\n\"Did I? Why, everybody is talking about it, and the newspapers have\nbeen full of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs Mackenzie, that is so terrible.\"\n\n\"But nobody has said a word against you. Even that stupid clergyman,\nwho calls you the lamb, has not pretended to say that you were\nhis lamb. We had the whole story of the Lion and the Lamb in the\n_Inverary Interpreter_, but I had no idea that it was you, then. But\nthe long and the short of it is, that my husband says he must know\nhis cousin; and to tell the truth, it was he that sent me; and we\nwant you to come and stay with us in Cavendish Square till the\nlawsuit is over, and everything is settled.\"\n\nMargaret was so startled by the proposition, that she did not know\nhow to answer it. Of course she was at first impressed with a strong\nidea of the impossibility of her complying with such a request,\nand was simply anxious to find some proper way of refusing it. The\nIncharrow Mackenzies were great people who saw much company, and it\nwas, she thought, quite out of the question that she should go to\ntheir house. At no time of her career would she have been, as she\nconceived, fit to live with such grand persons; but at the present\nmoment, when she grudged herself even a new pair of gloves out of\nthe money remaining to her, while she was still looking forward to\na future life passed as a nurse in a hospital, she felt that there\nwould be an absolute unfitness in such a visit.\n\n\"You are very kind,\" she said at last with faltering voice, as she\nmeditated in what words she might best convey her refusal.\n\n\"No, I'm not a bit kind; and I know from the tone of your voice that\nyou are meditating a refusal. But I don't mean to accept it. It is\nmuch better that you should be with us while all this is going on,\nthan that you should be living here alone. And there is no one with\nwhom you could live during this time so properly, as with those who\nare your nearest relatives.\"\n\n\"But, Mrs Mackenzie--\"\n\n\"I suppose you are thinking now of another cousin, but it's not at\nall proper that you should go to his house;--not as yet, you know.\nAnd you need not suppose that he'll object because of what I said\nabout Lady Ball and myself. The Capulets and the Montagues don't\nintend to keep it up for ever; and, though we have never visited Lady\nBall, my husband and the present Sir John know each other very well.\"\n\nMrs Mackenzie was not on that occasion able to persuade Margaret to\ncome at once to Cavendish Square, and neither was Margaret able to\ngive a final refusal. She did not intend to go, but she could not\nbring herself to speak a positive answer in such a way as to have\nmuch weight with Mrs Mackenzie. That lady left her at last, saying\nthat she would send her husband, and promising Margaret that she\nwould herself come in ten days to fetch her.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Margaret; \"it will be very good-natured of you to come,\nbut not for that.\"\n\n\"But I shall come, and shall come for that,\" said Mrs Mackenzie;\nand at the end of the ten days she did come, and she did carry her\nhusband's cousin back with her to Cavendish Square.\n\nIn the meantime Walter Mackenzie had called in Arundel Street,\nand had seen Margaret. But there had been given to her advice by\na counsellor whom she was more inclined to obey than any of the\nMackenzies. John Ball had written to her, saying that he had heard of\nthe proposition, and recommending her to accept the invitation given\nto her.\n\n\"Till all this trouble about the property is settled,\" said he, \"it\nwill be much better that you should be with your cousins than living\nalone in Mrs Buggins' lodgings.\"\n\nAfter receiving this Margaret held out no longer but was carried off\nby the handsome lady in the grand carriage, very much to the delight\nof Mrs Buggins.\n\nMrs Buggins' respect for Miss Mackenzie had returned altogether\nsince she had heard of the invitation to Cavendish Square, and she\napologised, almost without ceasing, for the liberty she had taken in\nsuggesting that Margaret should drink tea with her husband.\n\n\"And indeed, Miss, I shouldn't have proposed such a thing, were it\never so, if I had suspected for a hinstant how things were a going to\nbe. For Buggins is a man as knows his place, and never puts himself\nbeyond it! But you was that close, Miss--\"\n\nIn answer to this Margaret would say that it didn't signify, and that\nit wasn't on that account; and I have no doubt but that the two women\nthoroughly understood each other.\n\nThere was a subject on which, in spite of all her respect, Mrs\nBuggins ventured to give Miss Mackenzie much advice, and to insist on\nthat advice strongly. Mrs Buggins was very anxious that the future\n\"baronet's lady\" should go out upon her grand visit with a proper\nassortment of clothing. That argument of the baronet's lady was the\nclimax of Mrs Buggins' eloquence: \"You, my dear, as is going to be\none baronet's lady is going to a lady who is going to be another\nbaronet's lady, and it's only becoming you should go as is becoming.\"\n\nMargaret declared that she was not going to be anybody's lady, but\nMrs Buggins altogether pooh-poohed this assertion.\n\n\"That, Miss, is your predestination,\" said Mrs Buggins, \"and well\nyou'll become it. And as for money, doesn't that old party who\nfound it all out say reg'lar once a month that there's whatever you\nwant to take for your own necessaries? and you that haven't had a\nshilling from him yet! If it was me, I'd send him in such a bill for\nnecessaries as 'ud open that old party's eyes a bit, and hurry him up\nwith his lawsuits.\"\n\nThe matter was at last compromised between her and Margaret, and a\nvery moderate expenditure for smarter clothing was incurred.\n\nOn the day appointed Mrs Mackenzie again came, and Margaret was\ncarried off to Cavendish Square. Here she found herself suddenly\nbrought into a mode of life altogether different from anything she\nhad as yet experienced. The Mackenzies were people who went much into\nsociety, and received company frequently at their own house. The\nfirst of these evils for a time Margaret succeeded in escaping, but\nfrom the latter she had no means of withdrawing herself. There was\nvery much to astonish her at this period of her life, but that which\nastonished her perhaps more than anything else was her own celebrity.\nEverybody had heard of the Lion and the Lamb, and everybody was aware\nthat she was supposed to represent the milder of those two favourite\nanimals. Everybody knew the story of her property, or rather of\nthe property which had never in truth been hers, and which was now\nbeing made to pass out of her hands by means of a lawsuit, of which\neverybody spoke as though it were the best thing in the world for\nall the parties concerned. People, when they mentioned Sir John Ball\nto her--and he was often so mentioned--never spoke of him in harsh\nterms, as though he were her enemy. She observed that he was always\nnamed before her in that euphuistic language which we naturally use\nwhen we speak to persons of those who are nearest to them and dearest\nto them. The romance of the thing, and not the pity of it, was the\ngeneral subject of discourse, so that she could not fail to perceive\nthat she was generally regarded as the future wife of Sir John Ball.\n\nIt was the sudden way in which all this had come upon her that\naffected her so greatly. While staying in Arundel Street she had\nbeen altogether ignorant that the story of the Lion and the Lamb had\nbecome public, or that her name had been frequent in men's mouths.\nWhen Mrs Buggins had once told her that she was thus becoming famous,\nshe had ridiculed Mrs Buggins' statement. Mrs Buggins had brought\nhome word from some tea-party that the story had been discussed among\nher own friends; but Miss Mackenzie had regarded that as an accident.\nA lawyer's clerk or two about Chancery Lane or Carey Street might by\nchance hear of the matter in the course of their daily work;--that it\nshould be so, and that such people talked of her affairs distressed\nher; but that had, she was sure, been all. Now, however, in her new\nhome she had learned that Mr Maguire's efforts had become notorious,\nand that she and her history were public property. When all this\nfirst became plain to her, it overwhelmed her so greatly that she was\nafraid to show her face; but this feeling gradually wore itself away,\nand she found herself able to look around upon the world again, and\nask herself new questions of the future, as she had done when she had\nfirst found herself to be the possessor of her fortune.\n\nWhen she had been about three weeks with the Mackenzies, Sir John\nBall came to see her. He had written to her once before that, but his\nletter had referred simply to some matter of business. When he was\nshown into the drawing-room in Cavendish Square, Mrs Mackenzie and\nMargaret were both there, but the former in a few minutes got up\nand left the room. Margaret had wished with all her heart that her\nhostess would remain with them. She was sure that Sir John Ball had\nnothing to say that she would care to hear, and his saying nothing\nwould seem to be of no special moment while three persons were in the\nroom. But his saying nothing when special opportunity for speaking\nhad been given to him would be of moment to her. Her destiny was in\nhis hands to such a degree that she felt his power over her to amount\nalmost to a cruelty. She longed to ask him what her fate was to be,\nbut it was a question that she could not put to him. She knew that he\nwould not tell her now; and she knew also that the very fact of his\nnot telling her would inflict upon her a new misery, and deprive her\nof the comfort which she was beginning to enjoy. If he could not tell\nher at once how all this was to be ended, it would be infinitely\nbetter for her that he should remain away from her altogether.\n\nAs soon as Mrs Mackenzie had left the room he began to describe to\nher his last interview with the lawyers. She listened to him, and\npretended to interest herself, but she did not care two straws about\nthe lawyers. Point after point he explained to her, showing the\nunfortunate ingenuity with which his uncle Jonathan had contrived to\nconfuse his affairs, and Margaret attempted to appear concerned. But\nher mind had now for some months past refused to exert itself with\nreference to the mode in which Mr Jonathan Ball had disposed of his\nmoney. Two years ago she had been told that it was hers; since that,\nshe had been told that it was not hers. She had felt the hardship of\nthis at first; but now that feeling was over with her, and she did\nnot care to hear more about it. But she did care very much to know\nwhat was to be her future fate.\n\n\"And when will be the end of it, John?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Ha! that seems so hard to say. They did name the first of April, but\nit won't be so soon as that. Mr Slow said to-day about the end of\nApril, but his clerk seems to think it will be the middle of May.\"\n\n\"It is very provoking,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" said John Ball, \"very provoking; I feel it so. It\nworries me so terribly that I have no comfort in life. But I suppose\nyou find everything very nice here.\"\n\n\"They are very kind to me.\"\n\n\"Very kind, indeed. It was quite the proper thing for them to do; and\nwhen I heard that Mrs Mackenzie had been to you in Arundel Street, I\nwas delighted.\"\n\nMargaret did not dare to tell him that she would have preferred to\nhave been left in Arundel Street; but that, at the moment, was her\nfeeling. If, when all this was over, she would still have to earn her\nbread, it would have been much better for her not to have come among\nher rich relations. What good would it then do her to have lived two\nor three months in Cavendish Square?\n\n\"I wish it were all settled, John,\" she said; and as she spoke there\nwas a tear standing in the corner of each eye.\n\n\"I wish it were, indeed,\" said John Ball; but I think that he did not\nsee the tears.\n\nIt was on her tongue to speak some word about the hospital; but she\nfelt that if she did so now, it would be tantamount to asking him\nthat question which it did not become her to ask; so she repressed\nthe word, and sat in silence.\n\n\"When the day is positively fixed for the hearing,\" said he, \"I will\nbe sure to let you know.\"\n\n\"I wish you would let me know nothing further about it, John, till it\nis all settled.\"\n\n\"I sometimes almost fancy that I wish the same thing,\" said he, with\na faint attempt at a smile; and after that he got up and went his\nway.\n\nThis was not to be endured. Margaret declared to herself that she\ncould not live and bear it. Let the people around her say what they\nwould, it could not be that he would treat her in this way if he\nintended to make her his wife. It would be better for her to make\nup her mind that it was not to be so, and to insist on leaving the\nMackenzies' house. She would go, not again to Arundel Street, but to\nsome lodging further away, in some furthest recess of London, where\nno one would come to her and flurry her with false hopes, and there\nremain till she might be allowed to earn her bread. That was the mood\nin which Mrs Mackenzie found her late in the afternoon on the day of\nSir John Ball's visit. There was to be a dinner party in the house\nthat evening, and Margaret began by asking leave to absent herself.\n\n\"Nonsense, Margaret,\" said Mrs Mackenzie; \"I won't have anything of\nthe kind.\"\n\n\"I cannot come down, Mrs Mackenzie; I cannot, indeed.\"\n\n\"That is absolute nonsense. That man has been saying something unkind\nto you. Why do you mind what he says?\"\n\n\"He has not said anything unkind; he has not said anything at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's the grief, is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by grief; but if you were situated as I\nam you would perceive that you were in a false position.\"\n\n\"I am sure he has been saying something unkind to you.\"\n\nMargaret hardly knew how to tell her thoughts and feelings, and yet\nshe wished to tell them. She had resolved that she would tell the\nwhole to Mrs Mackenzie, having convinced herself that she could\nnot carry out her plan of leaving Cavendish Square without some\nexplanation of the kind. She did not know how to make her speech with\npropriety, so she jumped at the difficulty boldly. \"The truth is, Mrs\nMackenzie, that he has no more idea of marrying me than he has of\nmarrying you.\"\n\n\"Margaret, how can you talk such nonsense?\"\n\n\"It is not nonsense; it is true; and it will be much better that it\nshould all be understood at once. I have nothing to blame him for,\nnothing; and I don't blame him; but I cannot bear this kind of life\nany longer. It is killing me. What business have I to be living here\nin this way, when I have got nothing of my own, and have no one to\ndepend on but myself?\"\n\n\"Then he must have said something to you; but, whatever it was, you\ncannot but have misunderstood him.\"\n\n\"No; he has said nothing, and I have not misunderstood him.\" Then\nthere was a pause. \"He has said nothing to me, and I am bound to\nunderstand what that means.\"\n\n\"Margaret, I want to put one question to you,\" said Mrs Mackenzie,\nspeaking with a serious air that was very unusual with her,--\"and\nyou will understand, dear, that I only do so because of what you are\nsaying now.\"\n\n\"You may put any question you please to me,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"Has your cousin ever asked you to be his wife, or has he not?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has. He has asked me twice.\"\n\n\"And what answer did you make him?\"\n\n\"When I thought all the property was mine, I refused him. Then, when\nthe property became his, he asked me again, and I accepted him.\nSometimes, when I think of that, I feel so ashamed of myself, that I\nhardly dare to hold up my head.\"\n\n\"But you did not accept him simply because you had lost your money.\"\n\n\"No; but it looks so like it; does it not? And of course he must\nthink that I did so.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure he thinks nothing of the kind. But he did ask you,\nand you did accept him?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"And since that, has he ever said anything to you to signify that the\nmatch should be broken off?\"\n\n\"The very day after he had asked me, Mr Maguire came to the Cedars\nand saw me, and Lady Ball was there too. And he was very false, and\ntold my aunt things that were altogether untrue. He said that--that I\nhad promised to marry him, and Lady Ball believed him.\"\n\n\"But did Mr Ball believe him?\"\n\n\"My aunt said all that she could against me, and when John spoke to\nme the next day, it was clear that he was very angry with me.\"\n\n\"But did he believe you or Mr Maguire when you told him that Mr\nMaguire's story was a falsehood from beginning to end?\"\n\n\"But it was not a falsehood from beginning to end. That's where I\nhave been so very, very unfortunate; and perhaps I ought to say, as\nI don't want to hide anything from you, so very, very wrong. The man\ndid ask me to marry him, and I had given him no answer.\"\n\n\"Had you thought of accepting him?\"\n\n\"I had not thought about that at all, when he came to me. So I told\nhim that I would consider it all, and that he must come again.\"\n\n\"And he came again.\"\n\n\"Then my brother's illness occurred, and I went to London. After that\nMr Maguire wrote to me two or three times, and I refused him in the\nplainest language that I could use. I told him that I had lost all\nmy fortune, and then I was sure that there would be an end of any\ntrouble from him; but he came to the Cedars on purpose to do me all\nthis injury; and now he has put all these stories about me into the\nnewspapers, how can I think that any man would like to make me his\nwife? I have no right to be surprised that Lady Ball should be so\neager against it.\"\n\n\"But did Mr Ball believe you when you told him the story?\"\n\n\"I think he did believe me.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\nMargaret did not answer at once, but sat with her fingers up among\nher hair upon her brow:\n\n\"I am trying to think what were his words,\" she said, \"but I cannot\nremember. I spoke more than he did. He said that I should have told\nhim about Mr Maguire, and I tried to explain to him that there had\nbeen no time to do so. Then I said that he could leave me if he\nliked.\"\n\n\"And what did he answer?\"\n\n\"If I remember rightly, he made no answer. He left me saying that\nhe would see me again the next day. But the next day I went away.\nI would not remain in the house with Lady Ball after what she had\nbelieved about me. She took that other man's part against me, and\ntherefore I went away.\"\n\n\"Did he say anything as to your going?\"\n\n\"He begged me to stay, but I would not stay. I thought it was all\nover then. I regarded him as being quite free from any engagement,\nand myself as being free from any necessity of obeying him. And it\nwas all over. I had no right to think anything else.\"\n\n\"And what came next?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Nothing else has happened, except that Lady Ball came to me\nin Arundel Street, asking me to renounce him.\"\n\n\"And you refused?\"\n\n\"Yes; I would do nothing at her bidding. Why should I? She had been\nmy enemy throughout, since she found that the money belonged to her\nson and not to me.\"\n\n\"And all this time you have seen him frequently?\"\n\n\"I have seen him sometimes about the business.\"\n\n\"And he has never said a word to you about your engagement to him?\"\n\n\"Never a word.\"\n\n\"Nor you to him?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! how could I speak to him about it?\"\n\n\"I would have done so. I would not have had my heart crushed within\nme. But perhaps you were right. Perhaps it was best to be patient.\"\n\n\"I know that I have been wrong to expect anything or to hope for\nanything,\" said Margaret. \"What right have I to hope for anything\nwhen I refused him while I was rich?\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"When he asked me again, he only did it because he pitied me. I don't\nwant to be any man's wife because he pities me.\"\n\n\"But you accepted him.\"\n\n\"Yes; because I loved him.\"\n\n\"And now?\" Again Miss Mackenzie sat silent, still moving her fingers\namong the locks upon her brow. \"And now, Margaret?\" repeated Mrs\nMackenzie.\n\n\"What's the use of it now?\"\n\n\"But you do love him?\"\n\n\"Of course I love him. How shall it be otherwise? What has he done\nto change my love? His feelings have changed, and I have no right to\nblame him. He has changed; and I hate myself, because I feel that\nin coming here I have, as it were, run after him. I should have put\nmyself in some place where no thought of marrying him should ever\nhave come again to me.\"\n\n\"Margaret, you are wrong throughout.\"\n\n\"Am I? Everybody always says that I am always wrong.\"\n\n\"If I can understand anything of the matter, Sir John Ball has not\nchanged.\"\n\n\"Then, why--why--why?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, exactly; why? Why is it that men and women cannot always\nunderstand each other; that they will remain for hours in each\nother's presence without the power of expressing, by a single word,\nthe thoughts that are busy within them? Who can say why it is so? Can\nyou get up and make a clean breast of it all to him?\"\n\n\"But I am a woman, and am very poor.\"\n\n\"Yes, and he is a man, and, like most men, very dumb when they have\nanything at heart which requires care in the speaking. He knows no\nbetter than to let things be as they are; to leave the words all\nunspoken till he can say to you, 'Now is the time for us to go and\nget ourselves married;' just as he might tell you that now was the\ntime to go and dine.\"\n\n\"But will he ever say that?\"\n\n\"Of course he will. If he does not say so when all this business is\noff his mind, when Mr Maguire and his charges are put at rest, when\nthe lawyers have finished their work, then come to me and tell me\nthat I have deceived you. Say to me then, 'Clara Mackenzie, you have\nput me wrong, and I look to you to put me right.' You will find I\nwill put you right.\"\n\nIn answer to this, Margaret was able to say nothing further. She sat\nfor a while with her face buried in her hands thinking of it all,\nasking herself whether she might dare to believe it all. At last,\nhowever, she went up to dress for dinner; and when she came down to\nthe drawing-room there was a smile upon her face.\n\nAfter that a month or six weeks passed in Cavendish Square, and there\nwas, during all that time, no further special reference to Sir John\nBall or his affairs. Twice he was asked to dine with the Mackenzies,\nand on both occasions he did so. On neither of those evenings did\nhe say very much to Margaret; but, on both of them he said some few\nwords, and it was manifestly his desire that they should be regarded\nas friends.\n\nAnd as the spring came on, Margaret's patience returned to her, and\nher spirits were higher than they had been at any time since she\nfirst discovered that success among the Stumfoldians at Littlebath\ndid not make her happy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nThe Negro Soldiers' Orphan Bazaar\n\n\nIn the spring days of the early May there came up in London that\nyear a great bazaar,--a great charity bazaar on behalf of the orphan\nchildren of negro soldiers who had fallen in the American war.\nTidings had come to this country that all slaves taken in the\nrevolted States had been made free by the Northern invaders, and that\nthese free men had been called upon to show their immediate gratitude\nby becoming soldiers in the Northern ranks. As soldiers they were\nkilled in battle, or died, and as dead men they left orphans behind\nthem. Information had come that many of these orphans were starving,\nand hence had arisen the cause for the Negro Soldiers' Orphan Bazaar.\nThere was still in existence at that time, down at South Kensington,\nsome remaining court or outstanding building which had belonged to\nthe Great International Exhibition, and here the bazaar was to be\nheld. I do not know that I can trace the way in which the idea grew\nand became great, or that anyone at the time was able to attribute\nthe honour to the proper founder. Some gave it all to the Prince of\nWales, declaring that his royal highness had done it out of his own\nhead; and others were sure that the whole business had originated\nwith a certain philanthropical Mr Manfred Smith who had lately come\nup in the world, and was supposed to have a great deal to do with\nmost things. Be that as it may, this thing did grow and become\ngreat, and there was a list of lady patronesses which included some\nduchesses, one marchioness, and half the countesses in London. It was\nsoon manifest to the eyes of those who understood such things, that\nthe Negro Soldiers' Orphan Bazaar was to be a success, and therefore\nthere was no difficulty whatsoever in putting the custody of the\nstalls into the hands of proper persons. The difficulty consisted in\nrejecting offers from persons who undoubtedly were quite proper for\nsuch an occasion. There came to be interest made for permission to\nserve, and boastings were heard of unparalleled success in the bazaar\nline. The Duchess of St Bungay had a happy bevy of young ladies who\nwere to act as counter attendants under her grace; and who so happy\nas any young lady who could get herself put upon the duchess's staff?\nIt was even rumoured that a certain very distinguished person would\nhave shown herself behind a stall, had not a certain other more\ndistinguished person expressed an objection; and while the rumour\nwas afloat as to the junior of those two distinguished persons, the\nyoung-ladydom of London was frantic in its eagerness to officiate.\nNow at that time there had become attached to the name of our poor\nGriselda a romance with which the west-end of London had become\nwonderfully well acquainted. The story of the Lion and the Lamb was\nvery popular. Mr Maguire may be said to have made himself odious\nto the fashionable world at large, and the fate of poor Margaret\nMackenzie with her lost fortune, and the additional misfortune of her\nclerical pledged protector, had recommended itself as being truly\ninteresting to all the feeling hearts of the season. Before May was\nover, gentlemen were enticed to dinner parties by being told--and\nuntruly told--that the Lamb had been \"secured;\" as on the previous\nyear they had been enticed by a singular assurance as to Bishop\nColenso; and when Margaret on one occasion allowed herself to be\ntaken to Covent Garden Theatre, every face from the stalls was turned\ntowards her between the acts.\n\nWho then was more fit to take a stall, or part of a stall at the\nNegro Soldiers' Orphan Bazaar, than our Griselda? When the thing\nloomed so large, lady patronesses began to be aware that mere\nnobodies would hardly be fit for the work. There would have been\nlittle or no difficulty in carrying out a law that nobody should\ntake a part in the business who had not some handle to her name, but\nit was felt that such an arrangement as that might lead to failure\nrather than glory. The commoner world must be represented but it\nshould be represented only by ladies who had made great names for\nthemselves. Mrs Conway Sparkes, the spiteful poetess, though she was\nold and ugly as well as spiteful, was to have a stall and a bevy,\nbecause there was thought to be no doubt about her poetry. Mrs\nChaucer Munro had a stall and a bevy; but I cannot clearly tell her\nclaim to distinction, unless it was that she had all but lost her\ncharacter four times, but had so saved it on each of those occasions\nthat she was just not put into the Index Expurgatorius of fashionable\nsociety in London. It was generally said by those young men who\ndiscussed the subject, that among Mrs Chaucer Munro's bevy would\nbe found the most lucrative fascination of the day. And then Mrs\nMackenzie was asked to take a stall, or part of a stall, and to bring\nGriselda with her as her assistant. By this time the Lamb was most\ngenerally known as \"Griselda\" among fashionable people.\n\nNow Mrs Mackenzie was herself a woman of fashion, and quite open to\nthe distinction of having a part assigned to her at the great bazaar\nof the season. She did not at all object to a booth on the left hand\nof the Duchess of St Bungay, although it was just opposite to Mrs\nChaucer Munro. She assented at once.\n\n\"But you must positively bring Griselda,\" said Lady Glencora\nPalliser, by whom the business of this mission was conducted.\n\n\"Of course, I understand that,\" said Mrs Mackenzie. \"But what if she\nwon't come?\"\n\n\"Griseldas are made to do anything,\" said Lady Glencora, \"and of\ncourse she must come.\"\n\nHaving settled the difficulty in this way, Lady Glencora went her\nway, and Mrs Mackenzie did not allow Griselda to go to her rest that\nnight till she had extracted from her a promise of acquiescence,\nwhich, I think, never would have been given had Miss Mackenzie\nunderstood anything of the circumstances under which her presence was\ndesired.\n\nBut the promise was given, and Margaret knew little or nothing of\nwhat was expected from her till there came up, about a fortnight\nbefore the day of the bazaar, the great question of her dress for\nthe occasion. Previous to that she would fain have been energetic in\ncollecting and making things for sale at her stall, for she really\ntaught herself to be anxious that the negro soldiers' orphans\nshould have provision made for them; but, alas! her energy was\nall repressed, and she found that she was not to be allowed to do\nanything in that direction.\n\n\"Things of that sort would not go down at all now-a-days, Margaret,\"\nsaid Mrs Mackenzie. \"Nobody would trouble themselves to carry them\naway. There are tradesmen who furnish the stalls, and mark their\nown prices, and take back what is not sold. You charge double the\ntradesman's price, that's all.\"\n\nMargaret, when her eyes were thus opened, of course ceased to make\nlittle pincushions, but she felt that her interest in the thing was\nvery much lowered. But a word must be said as to that question of\nthe dress. Miss Mackenzie, when she was first interrogated as to her\nintentions, declared her purpose of wearing a certain black silk\ndress which had seen every party at Mrs Stumfold's during Margaret's\nLittlebath season. To this her cousin demurred, and from demurring\nproceeded to the enunciation of a positive order. The black silk\ndress in question should not be worn. Now Miss Mackenzie chose to be\nstill in mourning on the second of June, the day of the bazaar, her\nbrother having died in September, and had no fitting garment, so she\nsaid, other than the black silk in question. Whereupon Mrs Mackenzie,\nwithout further speech to her cousin on the subject, went out and\npurchased a muslin covered all over with the prettiest little frecks\nof black, and sent a milliner to Margaret, and provided a bonnet of\nmuch the same pattern, the gayest, lightest, jauntiest, falsest,\nmost make-belief-mourning bonnet that ever sprang from the art of a\ndesigner in bonnets--and thus nearly broke poor Margaret's heart.\n\n\"People should never have things given them, who can't buy for\nthemselves,\" she said, with tears in her eyes, \"because of course\nthey know what it means.\"\n\n\"But, my dearest,\" said Mrs Mackenzie, \"young ladies who never have\nany money of their own at all always accept presents from all their\nrelations. It is their special privilege.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, young ladies; but not women like me who are waiting to find\nout whether they are ruined or not.\"\n\nThe difficulty, however, was at last overcome, and Margaret, with\nmany inward upbraidings of her conscience, consented to wear the\nblack-freckled dress.\n\n\"I never saw anybody look so altered in my life,\" said Mrs Mackenzie,\nwhen Margaret, apparelled, appeared in the Cavendish Square\ndrawing-room on the morning in question. \"Oh, dear, I hope Sir John\nBall will come to look at you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! he won't be such a fool as to do anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"I took care to let him know that you would be there;\" said Mrs\nMackenzie.\n\n\"You didn't?\"\n\n\"But I did, my dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, what will he think of me?\" ejaculated Margaret; but\nnevertheless I fancy that there must have been some elation in her\nbosom when she regarded herself and the freckled muslin in the glass.\n\nBoth Mrs Mackenzie and Miss Mackenzie had more than once gone down\nto the place to inspect the ground and make themselves familiar with\nthe position they were to take. There were great stalls and little\nstalls, which came alternately; and the Mackenzie stall stood next\nto a huge centre booth at which the duchess was to preside. On their\nother hand was the stall of old Lady Ware, and opposite to them, as\nhas been before said, the doubtful Mrs Chaucer Munro was to hold\ndifficult sway over her bevy of loud nymphs. Together with Mrs\nMackenzie were two other Miss Mackenzies, sisters of her husband,\nhandsome, middle-aged women, with high cheek-bones and fine\nbrave-looking eyes. All the Mackenzies, except our Griselda, were\ndressed in the tartan of their clan; and over the stall there was\nsome motto in Gaelic, \"Dhu dhaith donald dhuth,\" which nobody could\nunderstand, but which was not the less expressive. Indeed, the\nMackenzie stall was got up very well; but then was it not known and\nunderstood that Mrs Mackenzie did get up things very well? It was\nacknowledged on all sides that the Lamb, Griselda, was uncommonly\nwell got up on this occasion.\n\nIt was understood that the ladies were to be assembled in the bazaar\nat half-past two, and that the doors were to be thrown open to the\npublic at three o'clock. Soon after half-past two Mrs Mackenzie's\ncarriage was at the door, and the other Mackenzies having come up at\nthe same time, the Mackenzie phalanx entered the building together.\nThere were many others with them, but as they walked up they found\nthe Countess of Ware standing alone in the centre of the building,\nwith her four daughters behind her. She had on her head a wonderful\ntiara, which gave to her appearance a ferocity almost greater than\nwas natural to her. She was a woman with square jaws, and a big face,\nand stout shoulders: but she was not, of her own unassisted height,\nvery tall. But of that tiara and its altitude she was proud, and as\nshe stood in the midst of the stalls, brandishing her umbrella-sized\nparasol in her anger, the ladies, as they entered, might well be\ncowed by her presence.\n\n\"When ladies say half-past two,\" said she, \"they ought to come at\nhalf-past two. Where is the Duchess of St Bungay? I shall not wait\nfor her.\"\n\nBut there was a lady there who had come in behind the Mackenzies,\nwhom nothing ever cowed. This was the Lady Glencora Palliser, the\ngreat heiress who had married the heir of a great duke, pretty,\nsaucy, and occasionally intemperate, in whose eyes Lady Ware with her\nferocious tiara was simply an old woman in a ridiculous head-gear.\nThe countess had apparently addressed herself to Mrs Mackenzie, who\nhad been the foremost to enter the building, and our Margaret had\nalready begun to tremble. But Lady Glencora stepped forward, and took\nthe brunt of the battle upon herself.\n\n\"Nobody ever yet was so punctual as my Lady Ware,\" said Lady\nGlencora.\n\n\"It is very annoying to be kept waiting on such occasions,\" said the\ncountess.\n\n\"But my dear Lady Ware, who keeps you waiting? There is your stall,\nand why on earth should you stand here and call us all over as we\ncome in, like naughty schoolboys?\"\n\n\"The duchess said expressly that she would be here at half-past two.\"\n\n\"Who ever expects the dear duchess to keep her word?\" said Lady\nGlencora.\n\n\"Or whoever cared whether she does or does not?\" said Mrs Chaucer\nMunro, who, with her peculiar bevy, had now made her way up among the\nfront rank.\n\nThen to have seen the tiara of Lady Ware, as it wagged and nodded\nwhile she looked at Mrs Munro, and to have witnessed the high\nmoral tone of the ferocity with which she stalked away to her own\nstall with her daughters behind her,--a tragi-comedy which it was\ngiven to no male eyes to behold,--would have been worth the whole\nafter-performance of the bazaar. No male eyes beheld that scene, as\nMr Manfred Smith, the manager, had gone out to look for his duchess,\nand missing her carriage in the crowd, did not return till the bazaar\nhad been opened. That Mrs Chaucer Munro did not sink, collapsed,\namong her bevy, must have been owing altogether to that callousness\nwhich a long habit of endurance produces. Probably she did feel\nsomething as at the moment there came no titter from any other bevy\ncorresponding to the titter which was raised by her own. She and\nher bevy retired to their allotted place, conscious that their time\nfor glory could not come till the male world should appear upon the\nscene. But Lady Ware's tiara still wagged and nodded behind her\ncounter, and Margaret, looking at her, thought that she must have\ncome there as the grand duenna of the occasion.\n\nJust at three o'clock the poor duchess hurried into the building in\na terrible flurry, and went hither and thither among the stalls, not\nknowing at first where was her throne. Unkind chance threw her at\nfirst almost into the booth of Mrs Conway Sparkes, the woman whom of\nall women she hated the most; and from thence she recoiled into the\narms of Lady Hartletop who was sitting serene, placid, and contented\nin her appointed place.\n\n\"Opposite, I think, duchess,\" Mrs Conway Sparkes had said. \"We are\nonly the small fry here.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah; I beg pardon. They told me the middle, to the left.\"\n\n\"And this is the middle to the right,\" said Mrs Conway Sparkes. But\nthe duchess had turned round since she came in, and could not at all\nunderstand where she was.\n\n\"Under the canopy, duchess,\" just whispered Lady Hartletop. Lady\nHartletop was a young woman who knew her right hand from her left\nunder all circumstances of life, and who never made any mistakes.\nThe duchess looked up in her confusion to the centre of the ceiling,\nbut could see no canopy. Lady Hartletop had done all that could\nbe required of her, and if the duchess were to die amidst her\ndifficulties it would not be her fault. Then came forth the Lady\nGlencora, and with true charity conducted the lady-president to her\nchair, just in time to avoid the crush, which ensued upon the opening\nof the doors.\n\nThe doors were opened, and very speedily the space of the bazaar\nbetween the stalls became too crowded to have admitted the safe\npassage of such a woman as the Duchess of St Bungay; but Lady\nGlencora, who was less majestic in her size and gait, did not find\nherself embarrassed. And now there arose, before the general work of\nfleecing the wether lambs had well commenced, a terrible discord, as\nof a brass band with broken bassoons, and trumpets all out of order,\nfrom the further end of the building,--a terrible noise of most\nunmusical music, such as Bartholomew Fair in its loudest days could\nhardly have known. At such a diapason one would have thought that the\ntender ears of May Fair and Belgravia would have been crushed and\ncracked and riven asunder; that female voices would have shrieked,\nand the intensity of fashionable female agony would have displayed\nitself in all its best recognised forms. But the crash of brass was\nborne by them as though they had been rough schoolboys delighting\nin a din. The duchess gave one jump, and then remained quiet and\nundismayed. If Lady Hartletop heard it, she did not betray the\nhearing. Lady Glencora for a moment put her hands to her ears as\nshe laughed, but she did it as though the prettiness of the motion\nwere its only one cause. The fine nerves of Mrs Conway Sparkes, the\npoetess, bore it all without flinching; and Mrs Chaucer Munro with\nher bevy rushed forward so that they might lose nothing of what was\ncoming.\n\n\"What are they going to do?\" said Margaret to her cousin, in alarm.\n\n\"It's the play part of the thing. Have you not seen the bills?\" Then\nMargaret looked at a great placard which was exhibited near to her,\nwhich, though by no means intelligible to her, gave her to understand\nthat there was a show in progress. The wit of the thing seemed\nto consist chiefly in the wonderful names chosen. The King of\nthe Cannibal Islands was to appear on a white charger. King\nChrononhotonthologos was to be led in chains by Tom Thumb. Achilles\nwould drag Hector thrice round the walls of Troy; and Queen Godiva\nwould ride through Coventry, accompanied by Lord Burghley and the\nambassador from Japan. It was also signified that in some back part\nof the premises a theatrical entertainment would be carried on\nthroughout the afternoon, the King of the Cannibal Islands, with his\nroyal brother and sister Chrononhotonthologos and Godiva, taking\nprincipal parts; but as nobody seemed to go to the theatre the\nperformers spent their time chiefly in making processions through and\namidst the stalls, when, as the day waxed hot, and the work became\nheavy, they seemed to be taken much in dudgeon by the various bevies\nwith whose business they interfered materially.\n\nOn this, their opening march, they rushed into the bazaar with great\nenergy, and though they bore no resemblance to the characters named\nin the playbill, and though there was among them neither a Godiva,\na Hector, a Tom Thumb, or a Japanese, nevertheless, as they were\ndressed in paint and armour after the manner of the late Mr\nRichardson's heroes, and as most of the ladies had probably been\nwithout previous opportunity of seeing such delights, they had their\neffect. When they had made their twenty-first procession the thing\ncertainly grew stale, and as they brought with them an infinity of\ndirt, they were no doubt a nuisance. But no one would have been\ninclined to judge these amateur actors with harshness who knew how\nmuch they themselves were called on to endure, who could appreciate\nthe disgusting misery of a hot summer afternoon spent beneath dust\nand paint and tin-plate armour, and who would remember that the\nperformers received payment neither in _\u00c3\u00a9clat_ nor in thanks, nor\neven in the smiles of beauty.\n\n\"Can't somebody tell them not to come any more?\" said the duchess,\nalmost crying with vexation towards the end of the afternoon.\n\nThen Mr Manfred Smith, who managed everything, went to the rear, and\nthe king and warriors were sent away to get beer or cooling drinks at\ntheir respective clubs.\n\nPoor Mr Manfred Smith! He had not been present at the moment in which\nhe was wanted to lead the duchess to her stall, and the duchess never\nforgave him. Instead of calling him by his name from time to time,\nand enabling him to shine in public as he deserved to shine,--for he\nhad worked at the bazaar for the last six weeks as no professional\nman ever worked at his profession,--the duchess always asked for\n\"somebody\" when she wanted Mr Smith, and treated him when he came\nas though he had been a servant hired for the occasion. One very\ndifficult job of work was given to him before the day was done; \"I\nwish you'd go over to those young women,\" said the duchess, \"and say\nthat if they make so much noise, I must go away.\"\n\nThe young women in question were Mrs Chaucer Munro and her bevy, and\nthe commission was one which poor Manfred Smith found it difficult to\nexecute.\n\n\"Mrs Munro,\" said he, \"you'll be sorry to hear--that the duchess--has\ngot--a headache, and she thinks we all might be a little quieter.\"\n\nThe shouts of the loud nymphs were by this time high. \"Pooh!\" said\none of them. \"Headache indeed!\" said another. \"Bother her head!\" said\na third. \"If the duchess is ill, perhaps she had better retire,\"\nsaid Mrs Chaucer Munro. Then Mr Manfred Smith walked off sorrowfully\ntowards the door, and seating himself on the stool of the money-taker\nby the entrance, wiped off the perspiration from his brow. He had\nalready put on his third pair of yellow kid gloves for the occasion,\nand they were soiled and torn and disreputable; his polished boots\nwere brown with dust; the magenta ribbon round his neck had become a\nmoist rope; his hat had been thrown down and rumpled; a drop of oil\nhad made a spot upon his trousers; his whiskers were draggled and out\nof order, and his mouth was full of dirt. I doubt if Mr Manfred Smith\nwill ever undertake to manage another bazaar.\n\nThe duchess I think was right in her endeavour to mitigate the riot\namong Mrs Munro's nymphs. Indeed there was rioting among other nymphs\nthan hers, though her noise and their noise was the loudest; and it\nwas difficult to say how there should not be riot, seeing what was to\nbe the recognised manner of transacting business. At first there was\nsomething of prettiness in the rioting. The girls, who went about\namong the crowd, begging men to put their hands into lucky bags,\ntrading in rose-buds, and asking for half-crowns for cigar lighters,\nwere fresh in their muslins, pretty with their braided locks, and\nperhaps not impudently over-pressing in their solicitations to male\nstrangers. While they were not as yet either aweary or habituated\nto the necessity of importunity, they remembered their girlhood and\ntheir ladyhood, their youth and their modesty, and still carried with\nthem something of the bashfulness of maidenhood; and the young men,\nthe wether lambs, were as yet flush with their half-crowns, and the\nelder sheep had not quite dispensed the last of their sovereigns or\nbuttoned up their trousers pockets. But as the work went on, and the\ndust arose, and the prettinesses were destroyed, and money became\nscarce, and weariness was felt, and the heat showed itself, and the\nmuslins sank into limpness, and the ribbons lost their freshness,\nand braids of hair grew rough and loose, and sidelocks displaced\nthemselves--as girls became used to soliciting and forgetful of their\nusual reticences in their anxiety for money, the charm of the thing\nwent, and all was ugliness and rapacity. Young ladies no longer moved\nabout, doing works of charity; but harpies and unclean birds were\ngreedy in quest of their prey.\n\n\"Put a letter in my post-office,\" said one of Mrs Munro's bevy, who\nofficiated in a postal capacity behind a little square hole, to a\nyoung man on whom she pounced out and had caught him and brought up,\nalmost with violence.\n\nThe young man tendered some scrap of paper and a sixpence.\n\n\"Only sixpence!\" said the girl.\n\nA cabman could not have made the complaint with a more finished\naccent of rapacious disgust.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said the girl, \"I'll give you an answer.\"\n\nThen, with inky fingers and dirty hands, she tendered him some\nscrawl, and demanded five shillings postage. \"Five shillings!\" said\nthe young man. \"Oh, I'm d----\"\n\nThen he gave her a shilling and walked away. She ventured to give one\nlittle halloa after him, but she caught the duchess's eye looking at\nher, and was quiet.\n\nI don't think there was much real flirting done. Men won't flirt with\ndraggled girls, smirched with dust, weary with work, and soiled with\nheat; and especially they will not do so at the rate of a shilling a\nword. When the whole thing was over, Mrs Chaucer Munro's bevy, lying\nabout on the benches in fatigue before they went away, declared\nthat, as far as they were concerned, the thing was a mistake. The\nexpenditure in gloves and muslin had been considerable, and the\nreturns to them had been very small. It is not only that men will\nnot flirt with draggled girls, but they will carry away with them\nunfortunate remembrances of what they have seen and heard. Upon the\nwhole it may be doubted whether any of the bevies were altogether\ncontented with the operations on the occasion of the Negro Soldiers'\nOrphan Bazaar.\n\nMiss Mackenzie had been, perhaps, more fortunate than some of the\nothers. It must, however, be remembered that there are two modes\nof conducting business at these bazaars. There is the travelling\nmerchant, who roams about, and there is the stationary merchant, who\nremains always behind her counter. It is not to be supposed that the\nDuchess of St Bungay spent the afternoon rushing about with a lucky\nbag. The duchess was a stationary trader, and so were all the ladies\nwho belonged to the Mackenzie booth. Miss Mackenzie, the lamb, had\nbeen much regarded, and consequently the things at her disposal had\nbeen quickly sold. It had all seemed to her to be very wonderful, and\nas the fun grew fast and furious, as the young girls became eager\nin their attacks, she made up her mind that she would never occupy\nanother stall at a bazaar. One incident, and but one, occurred to her\nduring the day; and one person came to her that she knew, and but\none. It was nearly six, and she was beginning to think that the weary\nwork must soon be over, when, on a sudden, she found Sir John Ball\nstanding beside her.\n\n\"Oh, John!\" she said, startled by his presence, \"who would have\nthought of seeing you here?\"\n\n\"And why not me as well as any other fool of my age?\"\n\n\"Because you think it is foolish,\" she answered, \"and I suppose the\nothers don't.\"\n\n\"Why should you say that I think it foolish? At any rate, I'm glad to\nsee you looking so nice and happy.\"\n\n\"I don't know about being happy,\" said Margaret,--\"or nice either for\nthe matter of that.\"\n\nBut there was a smile on her face as she spoke, and Sir John smiled\nalso when he saw it.\n\n\"Doesn't she look well in that bonnet?\" said Mrs Mackenzie, turning\nround to the side of the counter at which he was standing. \"It was my\nchoice, and I absolutely made her wear it. If you knew the trouble I\nhad!\"\n\n\"It is very pretty,\" said Sir John.\n\n\"Is it not? And are you not very much obliged to me? I'm sure\nyou ought to be, for nobody before has ever taken the trouble of\nfinding out what becomes her most. As for herself, she's much too\nwell-behaved a young woman to think of such vanities.\"\n\n\"Not at present, certainly,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"And why not at present? She looks on those lawyers and their work as\nthough there was something funereal about them. You ought to teach\nher better, Sir John.\"\n\n\"All that will be over in a day or two now,\" said he.\n\n\"And then she will shake off her dowdiness and her gloom together,\"\nsaid Mrs Mackenzie. \"Do you know I fancy she has a liking for pretty\nthings at heart as well as another woman.\"\n\n\"I hope she has,\" said he.\n\n\"Of course you do. What is a woman worth without it? Don't be angry,\nMargaret, but I say a woman is worth nothing without it, and Sir\nJohn will agree with me if he knows anything about the matter. But,\nMargaret, why don't you make him buy something? He can't refuse you\nif you ask him.\"\n\nIf Miss Mackenzie could thereby have provided for all the negro\nsoldiers' orphans in existence, I do not think that she could at that\nmoment have solicited him to make a purchase.\n\n\"Come, Sir John,\" continued Mrs Mackenzie, \"you must buy something of\nher. What do you say to this paper-knife?\"\n\n\"How much does the paper-knife cost?\" said he, still smiling. It was\na large, elaborate, and perhaps, I may say, unwieldy affair, with a\ngreat elephant at the end of it.\n\n\"Oh! that is terribly dear,\" said Margaret, \"it costs two pounds\nten.\"\n\nThereupon he put his hand into his pocket, and taking out his purse,\ngave her a five-pound note.\n\n\"We never give change,\" said Mrs Mackenzie: \"do we, Margaret?\"\n\n\"I'll give him change,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"I'll be extravagant for once,\" said Sir John, \"and let you keep the\nwhole.\"\n\n\"Oh, John!\" said Margaret.\n\n\"You have no right to scold him yet,\" said Mrs Mackenzie.\n\nMargaret, when she heard this, blushed up to her forehead, and in her\nconfusion forgot all about the paper-knife and the money. Sir John, I\nfancy, was almost as much confused himself, and was quite unable to\nmake any fitting reply. But, just at that moment, there came across\ntwo harpies from the realms of Mrs Chaucer Munro, eagerly intent upon\ntheir prey.\n\n\"Here are the lion and the lamb together,\" said one harpy. \"The lion\nmust buy a rose to give to the lamb. Sir Lion, the rose is but a\npoor half-crown.\" And she tendered him a battered flower, leering\nat him from beneath her draggled, dusty bonnet as she put forth her\nuntempting hand for the money.\n\n\"Sir Lion, Sir Lion,\" said the other harpy, \"I want your name for a\nraffle.\"\n\nBut the lion was off, having pushed the first harpy aside somewhat\nrudely. That tale of the Lion and the Lamb had been very terrible to\nhim; but never till this occasion had any one dared to speak of it\ndirectly to his face. But what will not a harpy do who has become\nwild and dirty and disgusting in the pursuit of half-crowns?\n\n\"Now he is angry,\" said Margaret. \"Oh, Mrs Mackenzie, why did you say\nthat?\"\n\n\"Yes; he is angry,\" said Mrs Mackenzie, \"but not with you or me. Upon\nmy word, I thought he would have pushed that girl over; and if he\nhad, he would only have served her right.\"\n\n\"But why did you say that? You shouldn't have said it.\"\n\n\"About your not scolding him yet? I said it, my dear, because I\nwanted to make myself certain. I was almost certain before, but now I\nam quite certain.\"\n\n\"Certain of what, Mrs Mackenzie?\"\n\n\"That you'll be a baronet's wife before me, and entitled to be taken\nout of a room first as long as dear old Sir Walter is alive.\"\n\nSoon after that the bazaar was brought to an end, and it was supposed\nto have been the most successful thing of the kind ever done in\nLondon. Loud boasts were made that more than eight hundred pounds had\nbeen cleared; but whether any orphans of any negro soldiers were ever\nthe better for the money I am not able to say.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nShowing How the Lion Was Stung by the Wasp\n\n\nIt may be remembered that Mr Maguire, when he first made public that\npretty story of the Lion and the Lamb, declared that he would give\nthe lion no peace till that beast had disgorged his prey, and that\nhe had pledged himself to continue the fight till he should have\nsucceeded in bringing the lamb back to the pleasant pastures of\nLittlebath. But Mr Maguire found some difficulty in carrying out his\npledge. He was willing enough to fight, but the weapons with which\nto do battle were wanting to him. The _Christian Examiner_, having\ngot so far into the mess, and finding that a ready sale did in\ntruth result from any special article as to the lion and the lamb,\nwas indeed ready to go on with the libel. The _Christian Examiner_\nprobably had not much to lose. But there arose a question whether\nfighting simply through the columns of the _Christian Examiner_ was\nnot almost tantamount to no fight at all. He wanted to bring an\naction against Sir John Ball, to have Sir John Ball summoned into\ncourt and examined about the money, to hear some truculent barrister\ntell Sir John Ball that he could not conceal himself from the scorn\nof an indignant public behind the spangles of his parvenu baronetcy.\nHe had a feeling that the lion would be torn to pieces, if only a\nproperly truculent barrister could be got to fix his claws into him.\nBut, unfortunately, no lawyer,--not even Solomon Walker, the Low\nChurch attorney at Littlebath,--would advise him that he had any\nground for an action. If indeed he chose to proceed against the lady\nfor a breach of promise of marriage, then the result would depend\non the evidence. In such case as that the Low Church attorney at\nLittlebath was willing to take the matter up. \"But Mr Maguire was,\nof course, aware,\" said Solomon Walker, \"that there was a prejudice\nin the public mind against gentlemen appearing as parties to such\nsuits.\" Mr Maguire was also aware that he could adduce no evidence of\nthe fact beyond his own unsupported, and, in such case, untrue word,\nand declared therefore to the attorney, in a very high tone indeed,\nthat on no account would he take any step to harass the lady. It was\nsimply against Sir John Ball that he wished to proceed. \"Things would\ncome out in that trial, Mr Walker,\" he said, \"which would astonish\nyou and all the legal world. A rapacious scheme of villainy has been\nconceived and brought to bear, through the stupidity of some people\nand the iniquity of others, which would unroll itself fold by fold as\ncertainly as I stand here, if it were properly handled by a competent\nbarrister in one of our courts of law.\" And I think that Mr Maguire\nbelieved what he was saying, and that he believed, moreover, that\nhe was speaking the truth when he told Mr Walker that the lady had\npromised to marry him. Men who can succeed in deceiving no one else\nwill succeed at last in deceiving themselves. But the lawyer told\nhim, repeating the fact over and over again, that the thing was\nimpracticable; that there was no means of carrying the matter so\nfar that Sir John Ball should be made to appear in a witness box.\nEverything that Sir John had done he had done legally; and even at\nthat moment of the discussion between Mr Walker and Mr Maguire, the\nquestion of the ownership of the property was being tried before a\nproper tribunal in London. Mr Maguire still thought Mr Walker to be\nwrong,--thought that his attorney was a weak and ignorant man; but he\nacknowledged to himself the fact that he in his unhappy position was\nunable to get any more cunning attorney to take the matter in hand.\n\nBut the _Christian Examiner_ still remained to him, and that he used\nwith diligence. From week to week there appeared in it articles\nattacking the lion, stating that the lion was still being watched,\nthat his prey would be snatched from him at last, that the lamb\nshould even yet have her rights, and the like. And as the thing\nwent on, the periodical itself and the writer of the article became\ncourageous by habit, till things were printed which Sir John Ball\nfound it almost impossible to bear. It was declared that he was going\nto desert the lamb, now that he had taken all the lamb's property;\nand that the lamb, shorn of all her fleece, was to be condemned\nto earn her bread as a common nurse in the wards of a common\nhospital,--all which information came readily enough to Mr Maguire by\nthe hands of Miss Colza. The papers containing these articles were\nalways sent to Sir John Ball and to Miss Mackenzie, and the articles\nwere always headed, \"The Lion and the Lamb.\" Miss Mackenzie, in\naccordance with an arrangement made to that purpose, sent the papers\nas soon as they came to Mr Slow, but Sir John Ball had no such ready\nway of freeing himself from their burden. He groaned and toiled\nunder them, going to his lawyer with them, and imploring permission\nto bring an action for libel against Mr Maguire. The venom of the\nunclean animal's sting had gone so deep into him, that, fond as he\nwas of money, he had told his lawyer that he would not begrudge the\nexpense if he could only punish the man who was hurting him. But the\nattorney, who understood something of feeling as well as something\nof money, begged him to be quiet at any rate till the fate of the\nproperty should be settled. \"And if you'll take my advice, Sir John,\nyou will not notice him at all. You may be sure that he has not a\nshilling in the world, and that he wants you to prosecute him. When\nyou have got damages against him, he will be off out of the country.\"\n\n\"But I shall have stopped his impudent ribaldry,\" said Sir John\nBall. Then the lawyer tried to explain to him that no one read the\nribaldry. It was of no use. Sir John read it himself, and that was\nenough to make him wretched.\n\nThe little fable which made Sir John so unhappy had not, for some\nmonths past, appeared in any of the metropolitan newspapers; but when\nthe legal inquiry into the proper disposition of Mr Jonathan Ball's\nproperty was over, and when it was known that, as the result of that\ninquiry, the will in favour of the Mackenzies was to be set aside and\nthe remains of the property handed over to Sir John, then that very\ninfluential newspaper, which in the early days of the question had\ntold the story of the Lion and the Lamb, told it all again, tearing,\nindeed, the Littlebath _Christian Examiner_ into shreds for its\niniquity, but speaking of the romantic misfortune of the lamb in\nterms which made Sir John Ball very unhappy. The fame which accrued\nto him from being so publicly pointed out as a lion, was not fame\nof which he was proud. And when the writer in this very influential\nnewspaper went on to say that the world was now looking for a\ntermination of this wonderful story, which would make it pleasant to\nall parties, he was nearly beside himself in his misery. He, a man\nof fifty, of slow habits, with none of the buoyancy of youth left\nin him, apt to regard himself as older than his age, who had lived\nwith his father and mother almost on an equality in regard to habits\nof life, the father of a large family, of which the eldest was now\nhimself a man! Could it be endured that such a one as he should enter\nupon matrimony amidst the din of public trumpets and under a halo\nof romance? The idea of it was frightful to him. On the very day\non which the result of the legal investigation was officially\ncommunicated to him, he sat in the old study at the Cedars with two\nnewspapers before him. In one of these there was a description of\nhis love, which he knew was intended as furtive ridicule, and an\nassurance to the public that the lamb's misfortunes would all be\nremedied by the sweet music of the marriage bell. What right had any\none to assert publicly that he intended to marry any one? In his\nwretchedness and anger he would have indicted this newspaper also for\na libel, had not his lawyer assured him that, according to law, there\nwas no libel in stating that a man was going to be married. The other\npaper accused him of rapacity and dishonesty in that he would not\nmarry the lamb, now that he had secured the lamb's fleece; so that,\nin truth, he had no escape on either side; for Mr Maguire, having\nat last ascertained that the lamb had, in very truth, lost all her\nfleece, was no longer desirous of any personal connection, and felt\nthat he could best carry out his pledge by attacking the possessor\nof the fleece on that side. Under such circumstances, what was such\na man as Sir John Ball to do? Could he marry his cousin amidst the\ntrumpets, and the halo, and the doggrel poetry which would abound?\nWas it right that he should be made a mark for the finger of scorn?\nHad he done anything to deserve this punishment?\n\nAnd it must be remembered that from day to day his own mother, who\nlived with him, who sat with him late every night talking on this one\nsubject, was always instigating him to abandon his cousin. It had\nbeen admitted between them that he was no longer bound by his offer.\nMargaret herself had admitted it,--\"does not attempt to deny it,\" as\nLady Ball repeated over and over again. When he had made his offer he\nhad known nothing of Mr Maguire's offer, nor had Margaret then told\nhim of it. Such reticence on her part of course released him from his\nbond. So Lady Ball argued, and against this argument her son made\nno demur. Indeed it was hardly possible that he should comprehend\nexactly what had taken place between his cousin and Mr Maguire. His\nmother did not scruple to assure him that she must undoubtedly at one\ntime have accepted the man's proposal. In answer to this John Ball\nwould always assert his entire reliance on his cousin's word.\n\n\"She did it without knowing that she did so,\" Lady Ball would answer;\n\"but in some language she must have assented.\"\n\nBut the mother was never able to extract from the son any intimation\nof his intention to give up the marriage, though she used threats and\ntears, ridicule and argument,--appeals to his pride and appeals to\nhis pocket. He never said that he certainly would marry her; he never\nsaid so at least after that night on which Margaret in her bedroom\nhad told him her story with reference to Mr Maguire; but neither did\nhe ever say that he certainly would not marry her. Lady Ball gathered\nfrom all his words a conviction that he would be glad to be released,\nif he could be released by any act on Margaret's behalf, and\ntherefore she had made her attempt on Margaret. With what success\nthe reader will, I hope, remember. Margaret, when she accepted her\ncousin's offer, had been specially bidden by him to be firm. This\nbidding she obeyed, and on that side there was no hope at all for\nLady Ball.\n\nI fear there was much of cowardice on Sir John's part. He had, in\ntruth, forgiven Margaret any offence that she had committed in\nreference to Mr Maguire. She had accepted his offer while another\noffer was still dragging on an existence after a sort, and she had\nnot herself been the first to tell him of these circumstances. There\nhad been offence to him in this, but that offence he had, in truth,\nforgiven. Had there been no Littlebath _Christian Examiner_, no tale\nof the Lion and the Lamb, no publicity and no ridicule, he would\nquietly have walked off with his cousin to some church, having gone\nthrough all preliminary ceremonies in the most silent manner possible\nfor them, and would have quietly got himself married and have carried\nMargaret home with him. Now that his father was dead and that his\nuncle Jonathan's money had come to him, his pecuniary cares were\ncomparatively light, and he believed that he could be very happy with\nMargaret and his children. But then to be pointed at daily as a lion,\nand to be asked by all his acquaintances after the lamb! It must be\nowned that he was a coward; but are not most men cowards in such\nmatters as that?\n\nBut now the trial was over, the money was his own, Margaret was left\nwithout a shilling in the world, and it was quite necessary that\nhe should make up his mind. He had once told his lawyer, in his\npremature joy, on that very day on which Mr Maguire had come to the\nCedars, that everything was to be made smooth by a marriage between\nhimself and the disinherited heiress. He had since told the lawyer\nthat something had occurred which might, perhaps, alter this\narrangement. After that the lawyer had asked no question about\nthe marriage; but when he communicated to his client the final\nintelligence that Jonathan Ball's money was at his client's disposal,\nhe said that it would be well to arrange what should be done on Miss\nMackenzie's behalf. Sir John Ball had assumed very plainly a look of\nvexation when the question was put to him.\n\n\"I promised Mr Slow that I would ask you,\" said the lawyer. \"Mr Slow\nis of course anxious for his client.\"\n\n\"It is my business and not Mr Slow's,\" said Sir John Ball, \"and you\nmay tell him that I say so.\"\n\nThen there had been a moment's silence, and Sir John had felt himself\nto be wrong.\n\n\"Pray tell him also,\" said Sir John, \"that I am very grateful to him\nfor his solicitude about my cousin, and that I fully appreciate his\nadmirable conduct both to her and me throughout all this affair. When\nI have made up my mind what shall be done, I will let him know at\nonce.\"\n\nAs he walked down from his lawyer's chambers in Bedford Row to the\nrailway station he thought of all this, and thought also of those\nwords which Mrs Mackenzie had spoken to him in the bazaar. \"You have\nno right to scold him yet,\" she had said to Margaret. Of course he\nhad understood what they meant, and of course Margaret had understood\nthem also. And he had not been at all angry when they were spoken.\nMargaret had been so prettily dressed, and had looked so fresh and\nnice, that at that moment he had forgotten all his annoyances in his\nadmiration, and had listened to Mrs Mackenzie's cunning speech, not\nwithout confusion, but without any immediate desire to contradict its\nnecessary inference. A moment or two afterwards the harpies had been\nupon him, and then he had gone off in his anger. Poor Margaret had\nbeen unable to distinguish between the effects produced by the speech\nand by the harpies; but Mrs Mackenzie had been more clever, and had\nconsequently predicted her cousin's speedy promotion in the world's\nrank.\n\nSir John, as he went home, made up his mind to one of two\nalternatives. He would either marry his cousin or halve Jonathan\nBall's money with her. He wanted to marry her, and he wanted to keep\nthe money. He wanted to marry her especially since he had seen how\nnice she looked in black-freckled muslin; but he wanted to marry\nher in silence, without any clash of absurd trumpets, without\nridicule-moving leading articles, and fingers pointed at the\ntriumphant lion. He made up his mind to one of those alternatives,\nand resolved that he would settle which on that very night. His\nmind should be made up and told to his mother before he went to bed.\nNevertheless, when the girls and Jack were gone, and he was left\nalone with Lady Ball, his mind had as yet been made up to nothing!\n\nHis mother gave him no peace on this subject. It was she who began\nthe conversation on this occasion.\n\n\"John,\" she said, \"the time has come for me to settle the question of\nmy residence.\"\n\nNow the house at Twickenham was the property of the present baronet,\nbut Lady Ball had a jointure of five hundred a year out of her late\nhusband's estate. It had always been intended that the mother should\ncontinue to live with her son and grandchildren in the very probable\nevent of her being left a widow; and it was felt by them all that\ntheir means were not large enough to permit, with discretion,\nseparate households; but Lady Ball had declared more than once with\nextreme vehemence that nothing should induce her to live at the\nCedars if Margaret Mackenzie should be made mistress of the house.\n\n\"Has the time come especially to-day?\" he asked in reply.\n\n\"I think we may say it has come especially to-day. We know now that\nyou have got this increase to your income, and nothing is any longer\nin doubt that we cannot ourselves settle. I need not say that my\ndearest wish is to remain here, but you know my mind upon that\nsubject.\"\n\n\"I cannot see any possible reason for your going.\"\n\n\"Nor can I--except the one. I suppose you know yourself what you mean\nto do about your cousin. Everybody knows what you ought to do after\nthe disgraceful things that have been put into all the newspapers.\"\n\n\"That has not been Margaret's fault.\"\n\n\"I am by no means so sure of that. Indeed, I think it has been her\nfault; and now she has made herself notorious by being at this\nbazaar, and by having herself called a ridiculous name by everybody.\nNothing will make me believe but what she likes it.\"\n\n\"You are ready to believe any evil of her, mother; and yet it is not\ntwo years since you yourself wished me to marry her.\"\n\n\"Things are very different since that; very different indeed. And I\ndid not know her then as I do now, or I should never have thought of\nsuch a thing, let her have had all the money in the world. She had\nnot misbehaved herself then with that horrible curate.\"\n\n\"She has not misbehaved herself now,\" said the son, in an angry\nvoice.\n\n\"Yes, she has, John,\" said the mother, in a voice still more angry.\n\n\"That's a matter for me to judge. She has not misbehaved herself\nin my eyes. It is a great misfortune,--a great misfortune for us\nboth,--the conduct of this man; but I won't allow it to be said that\nit was her fault.\"\n\n\"Very well. Then I suppose I may arrange to go. I did not think,\nJohn, that I should be turned out of your father's house so soon\nafter your father's death. I did not indeed.\"\n\nThereupon Lady Ball got out her handkerchief, and her son perceived\nthat real tears were running down her face.\n\n\"Nobody has ever spoken of your going except yourself, mother.\"\n\n\"I won't live in the house with her.\"\n\n\"And what would you have me do? Would you wish me to let her go her\nway and starve by herself?\"\n\n\"No, John; certainly not. I think you should see that she wants for\nnothing. She could live with her sister-in-law, and have the interest\nof the money that the Rubbs took from her. It was your money.\"\n\n\"I have explained to you over and over again, mother, that that has\nalready been made over to Mrs Tom Mackenzie; and that would not have\nbeen at all sufficient. Indeed, I have altogether made up my mind\nupon that. When the lawyers and all the expenses are paid, there will\nstill be about eight hundred a year. I shall share it with her.\"\n\n\"John!\"\n\n\"That is my intention; and therefore if I were to marry her I should\nget an additional income of four hundred a year for myself and my\nchildren.\"\n\n\"You don't mean it, John?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do, mother. I'm sure the world would expect me to do as\nmuch as that.\"\n\n\"The world expect you! And are you to rob your children, John,\nbecause the world expects it? I never heard of such a thing. Give\naway four hundred a year merely because you are afraid of those\nwretched newspapers! I did expect you would have more courage.\"\n\n\"If I do not do one, mother, I shall do the other certainly.\"\n\n\"Then I must beg you to tell me which you mean to do. If you gave\nher half of all that is coming to you, of course I must remain here\nbecause you could not live here without me. Your income would be\nquite insufficient. But you do owe it to me to tell me at once what I\nam to do.\"\n\nTo this her son made no immediate answer, but sat with his elbow\non the table, and his head upon his hand looking moodily at the\nfire-place. He did not wish to commit himself if he could possibly\navoid it.\n\n\"John, I must insist upon an answer,\" said his mother. \"I have a\nright to expect an answer.\"\n\n\"You must do what you like, mother, independently of me. If you think\nyou can live here on your income, I will go away, and you shall have\nthe place.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, John. Of course you want a large house for the\nchildren, and I, if I must be alone, shall only want one room for\nmyself. What should I do with the house?\" Then there was silence\nagain for a while.\n\n\"I will give you a final answer on Saturday,\" he said at last. \"I\nshall see Margaret before Saturday.\"\n\nAfter that he took his candle and went to bed. It was then Tuesday,\nand Lady Ball was obliged to be contented with the promise thus made\nto her.\n\nOn Wednesday he did nothing. On the Thursday morning he received a\nletter which nearly drove him mad. It was addressed to him at the\noffice of the Shadrach Fire Insurance Company, and it reached him\nthere. It was as follows--\n\n\n   Littlebath, -- June, 186--.\n\n   SIR,\n\n   You are no doubt fully aware of all the efforts which I\n   have made during the last six months to secure from your\n   grasp the fortune which did belong to my dear--my dearest\n   friend, Margaret Mackenzie. For as my dearest friend\n   I shall ever regard her, though she and I have been\n   separated by machinations of the nature of which she, as I\n   am fully sure, has never been aware. I now ascertain that\n   some of the inferior law courts have, under what pressure\n   I know not, set aside the will which was made twenty years\n   ago in favour of the Mackenzie family, and given to you\n   the property which did belong to them. That a superior\n   court would reverse the judgment, I believe there is\n   little doubt; but whether or no the means exist for me\n   to bring the matter before the higher tribunals of the\n   country I am not yet aware. Very probably I may have\n   no such power, and in such case, Margaret Mackenzie is,\n   to-day, through your means, a beggar.\n\n   Since this matter has been before the public you have\n   ingeniously contrived to mitigate the wrath of public\n   opinion by letting it be supposed that you purposed to\n   marry the lady whose wealth you were seeking to obtain by\n   legal quibbles. You have made your generous intentions\n   very public, and have created a romance that has been, I\n   must say, but little becoming to your age. If all be true\n   that I heard when I last saw Miss Mackenzie at Twickenham,\n   you have gone through some ceremony of proposing to her.\n   But, as I understand, that joke is now thought to have\n   been carried far enough; and as the money is your own, you\n   intend to enjoy yourself as a lion, leaving the lamb to\n   perish in the wilderness.\n\n   Now I call upon you to assert, under your own name and\n   with your own signature, what are your intentions with\n   reference to Margaret Mackenzie. Her property, at any rate\n   for the present, is yours. Do you intend to make her your\n   wife, or do you not? And if such be your intention, when\n   do you purpose that the marriage shall take place, and\n   where?\n\n   I reserve to myself the right to publish this letter and\n   your answer to it; and of course shall publish the fact\n   if your cowardice prevents you from answering it. Indeed\n   nothing shall induce me to rest in this matter till I\n   know that I have been the means of restoring to Margaret\n   Mackenzie the means of decent livelihood.\n\n   I have the honour to be, Sir,\n   Your very humble servant,\n\n   JEREMIAH MAGUIRE.\n\n   Sir John Ball, Bart., &c., &c,\n   Shadrach Fire Office.\n\n\nSir John, when he had read this, was almost wild with agony and\nanger. He threw up his hands with dismay as he walked along the\npassages of the Shadrach Office, and fulminated mental curses against\nthe wasp that was able to sting him so deeply. What should he do to\nthe man? As for answering the letter, that was of course out of the\nquestion; but the reptile would carry out his threat of publishing\nthe letter, and then the whole question of his marriage would be\ndiscussed in the public prints. An idea came across him that a free\npress was bad and rotten from the beginning to the end. This creature\nwas doing him a terrible injury, was goading him almost to death, and\nyet he could not punish him. He was a clergyman, and could not be\nbeaten and kicked, or even fired at with a pistol. As for prosecuting\nthe miscreant, had not his own lawyer told him over and over again\nthat such a prosecution was the very thing which the miscreant\ndesired. And then the additional publicity of such a prosecution,\nand the twang of false romance which would follow and the horrid\nalliteration of the story of the two beasts, and all the ridicule of\nthe incidents, crowded upon his mind, and he walked forth from the\nShadrach office among the throngs of the city a wretched and almost\ndespairing man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nA Friend in Need Is a Friend Indeed\n\n\nWhen the work of the bazaar was finished all the four Mackenzie\nladies went home to Mrs Mackenzie's house in Cavendish Square, very\ntired, eager for tea, and resolved that nothing more should be done\nthat evening. There should be no dressing for dinner, no going out,\nnothing but idleness, tea, lamb chops, and gossip about the day's\nwork. Mr Mackenzie was down at the House, and there was no occasion\nfor any domestic energy. And thus the evening was passed. How Mrs\nChaucer Munro and the loud bevy fared among them, or how old Lady\nWare and her daughters, or the poor, dear, bothered duchess or Mr\nManfred Smith, or the kings and heroes who had appeared in paint\nand armour, cannot be told. I fear that the Mackenzie verdict about\nthe bazaar in general was not favourable and that they agreed among\nthemselves to abstain from such enterprises of charity in future. It\nconcerns us now chiefly to know that our Griselda held up her head\nwell throughout that evening, and made herself comfortable and at her\nease among her cousins, although it was already known to her that the\nlegal decision had gone against her in the great case of Ball _v._\nMackenzie. But had that decision been altogether in her favour the\nresult would not have been so favourable to her spirits, as had been\nthat little speech made by Mrs Mackenzie as to her having no right as\nyet to scold Sir John for his extravagance,--that little speech made\nin good humour, and apparently accepted in good humour even by him.\nBut on that evening Mrs Mackenzie was not able to speak to Margaret\nabout her prospects, or to lecture her on the expediency of regarding\nthe nicenesses of her dress in Sir John's presence, because of the\ntwo other cousins. The two other cousins, no doubt, knew all the\nstory of the Lion and the Lamb, and talked to their sister-in-law,\nClara, of their other cousin, Griselda, behind Griselda's back; and\nwere no doubt very anxious that Griselda should become a baronet's\nwife; but among so large a party there was no opportunity for\nconfidential advice.\n\nOn the next morning Mrs Mackenzie and Margaret were together, and\nthen Mrs Mackenzie began:\n\n\"Margaret, my dear,\" said she, \"that bonnet I gave you has been worth\nits weight in gold.\"\n\n\"It cost nearly as much,\" said Margaret, \"for it was very expensive\nand very light.\"\n\n\"Or in bank-notes either, because it has shown him and me and\neverybody else that you needn't be a dowdy unless you please. No man\nwishes to marry a dowdy, you know.\"\n\n\"I suppose I was a dowdy when he asked me.\"\n\n\"I wasn't there, and didn't know you then, and can't say. But I do\nknow that he liked the way you looked yesterday. Now, of course,\nhe'll be coming here before long.\"\n\n\"I dare say he won't come here again the whole summer.\"\n\n\"If he did not, I should send for him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs Mackenzie!\"\n\n\"And oh, Griselda! Why should I not send for him? You don't suppose\nI'm going to let this kind of thing go on from month to month, till\nthat old woman at the Cedars has contrived to carry her point.\nCertainly not.\"\n\n\"Now that the matter is settled, of course, I shall not go on staying\nhere.\"\n\n\"Not after you're married, my dear. We couldn't well take in Sir John\nand all the children. Besides, we shall be going down to Scotland for\nthe grouse. But I mean you shall be married out of this house. Don't\nlook so astonished. Why not? There's plenty of time before the end of\nJuly.\"\n\n\"I don't think he means anything of the kind; I don't indeed.\"\n\n\"Then he must be the queerest man that ever I met; and I should say\nabout the falsest and most heartless also. But whether he means to\ndo that or does not, he must mean to do something. You don't suppose\nhe'll take all your fortune away from you, and then leave you without\ncoming to say a word to you about it? If you had disputed the matter,\nand put him to all manner of expense; if, in short, you had been\nenemies through it all, that might have been possible. But you have\nbeen such a veritable lamb, giving your fleece to the shearer so\nmeekly,--such a true Griselda, that if he were to leave you in that\nway, no one would ever speak to him again.\"\n\n\"But you forget Lady Ball.\"\n\n\"No, I don't. He'll have a disagreeable scene with his mother, and\nI don't pretend to guess what will be the end of that; but when he\nhas done with his mother, he'll come here. He must do it. He has no\nalternative. And when he does come, I want you to look your best.\nBelieve me, my dear, there would be no muslins in the world and no\nstarch, if it was not intended that people should make themselves\nlook as nice as possible.\"\n\n\"Young people,\" suggested Margaret.\n\n\"Young people, as you call them, can look well without muslin and\nwithout starch. Such things were intended for just such persons as\nyou and me; and as for me, I make it a rule to take the goods the\ngods provide me.\"\n\nMrs Mackenzie's philosophy was not without its result, and her\nprophecy certainly came true. A few days passed by and no lover came,\nbut early on the Friday morning after the bazaar, Margaret, who at\nthe moment was in her own room, was told that Sir John was below in\nthe drawing-room with Mrs Mackenzie. He had already been there some\nlittle time, the servant said, and Mrs Mackenzie had sent up with her\nlove to know if Miss Mackenzie would come down. Would she go down? Of\ncourse she would go to her cousin. She was no coward. Indeed, a true\nGriselda can hardly be a coward. So she made up her mind to go to her\ncousin and hear her fate.\n\nThe last four-and-twenty hours had been very bitter with Sir John\nBall. What was he to do, walking about with that man's letter in his\npocket--with that reptile's venom still curdling through his veins?\nOn that Thursday morning, as he went towards his office, he had made\nup his mind, as he thought, to go to Margaret and bid her choose her\nown destiny. She should become his wife, or have half of Jonathan\nBall's remaining fortune, as she might herself elect. \"She refused\nme,\" he said to himself, \"when the money was all hers. Why should she\nwish to come to such a house as mine, to marry a dull husband and\nundertake the charge of a lot of children? She shall choose herself.\"\nAnd then he thought of her as he had seen her at the bazaar, and\nbegan to flatter himself that, in spite of his dullness and his\nchildren, she would choose to become his wife. He was making some\nscheme as to his mother's life, proposing that two of his girls\nshould live with her, and that she should be near to him, when the\nletter from Mr Maguire was put into his hands.\n\nHow was he to marry his cousin after that? If he were to do so, would\nnot that wretch at Littlebath declare, through all the provincial\nand metropolitan newspapers, that he had compelled the marriage?\nThat letter would be published in the very column that told of the\nwedding. But yet he must decide. He must do something. They who read\nthis will probably declare that he was a weak fool to regard anything\nthat such a one as Mr Maguire could say of him. He was not a fool,\nbut he was so far weak and foolish; and in such matters such men are\nweak and foolish, and often cowardly.\n\nIt was, however, absolutely necessary that he should do something. He\nwas as well aware as was Mrs Mackenzie that it was essentially his\nduty to see his cousin, now that the question of law between them had\nbeen settled. Even if he had no thought of again asking her to be\nhis wife, he could not confide to any one else the task of telling\nher what was to be her fate. Her conduct to him in the matter of the\nproperty had been exemplary, and it was incumbent on him to thank her\nfor her generous forbearance. He had pledged himself also to give his\nmother a final answer on Saturday.\n\nOn the Friday morning, therefore, he knocked at the Mackenzies'\nhouse door in Cavendish Square, and soon found himself alone with\nMrs Mackenzie. I do not know that even then he had come to any\nfixed purpose. What he would himself have preferred would have been\npermission to postpone any action as regards his cousin for another\nsix months, and to have been empowered to use that time in crushing\nMr Maguire out of existence. But this might not be so, and therefore\nhe went to Cavendish Square that he might there decide his fate.\n\n\"You want to see Margaret, no doubt,\" said Mrs Mackenzie, \"that you\nmay tell her that her ruin is finally completed;\" and as she thus\nspoke of her cousin's ruin, she smiled her sweetest smile and put on\nher pleasantest look.\n\n\"Yes, I do want to see her presently,\" he said.\n\nMrs Mackenzie had stood up as though she were about to go in quest\nof her cousin, but had sat down again when the word presently\nwas spoken. She was by no means averse to having a few words of\nconversation about Margaret, if Sir John should wish it. Sir John, I\nfear, had merely used the word through some instinctive idea that he\nmight thereby stave off the difficulty for a while.\n\n\"Don't you think she looked very well at the Bazaar?\" said Mrs\nMackenzie.\n\n\"Very well, indeed,\" he answered; \"very well. I can't say I liked the\nplace.\"\n\n\"Nor any of us, I can assure you. Only one must do that sort of thing\nsometimes, you know. Margaret was very much admired there. So much\nhas been said of this singular story about her fortune, that people\nhave, of course, talked more of her than they would otherwise have\ndone.\"\n\n\"That has been a great misfortune,\" said Sir John, frowning.\n\n\"It has been a misfortune, but it has been one of those things that\ncan't be helped. I don't think you have any cause to complain, for\nMargaret has behaved as no other woman ever did behave, I think. Her\nconduct has been perfect.\"\n\n\"I don't complain of her.\"\n\n\"As for the rest, you must settle that with the world yourself. I\ndon't care for any one beyond her. But, for my part, I think it is\nthe best to let those things die away of themselves. After all, what\ndoes it matter as long as one does nothing to be ashamed of oneself?\nPeople can't break any bones by their talking.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you think it very unpleasant, Mrs Mackenzie, to have your\nname brought up in the newspapers?\"\n\n\"Upon my word I don't think I should care about it as long as my\nhusband stood by me. What is it after all? People say that you and\nMargaret are the Lion and the Lamb. What's the harm of being called a\nlamb or a lion either? As long as people are not made to believe that\nyou have behaved badly, that you have been false or cruel, I can't\nsee that it comes to much. One does not, of course, wish to have\nnewspaper articles written about one.\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"But they can't break your bones, nor can they make the world think\nyou dishonest, as long as you take care that you are honest. Now, in\nthis matter, I take it for granted that you and Margaret are going to\nmake a match of it--\"\n\n\"Has she told you so?\"\n\nMrs Mackenzie paused a moment to collect her thoughts before she\nanswered; but it was only for a moment, and Sir John Ball hardly\nperceived that she had ceased to speak.\n\n\"No,\" she said; \"she has not told me so. But I have told her that it\nmust be so.\"\n\n\"And she does not wish it?\"\n\n\"Do you want me to tell a lady's secret? But in such a case as\nthis the truth is always the best. She does wish it, with all her\nheart,--as much as any woman ever wished for anything. You need have\nno doubt about her loving you.\"\n\n\"Of course, Mrs Mackenzie, I should take care in any case that she\nwere provided for amply. If a single life will suit her best, she\nshall have half of all that she ever thought to be her own.\"\n\n\"And do you wish it to be so?\"\n\n\"I have not said that, Mrs Mackenzie. But it may be that I should\nwish her to have the choice fairly in her own power.\"\n\n\"Then I can tell you at once which she would choose. Your offer is\nvery generous. It is more than generous. But, Sir John, a single life\nwill not suit her; and my belief is, that were you to offer her the\nmoney without your hand, she would not take a farthing of it.\"\n\n\"She must have some provision.\"\n\n\"She will take none from you but the one, and you need be under no\ndoubt whatsoever that she will take that without a moment's doubt as\nto her own future happiness. And, Sir John, I think you would have\nthe best wife that I know anywhere among my acquaintance.\" Then she\nstopped, and he sat silent, making no reply. \"Shall I send to her\nnow?\" said Mrs Mackenzie.\n\n\"I suppose you might as well,\" said Sir John.\n\nThen Mrs Mackenzie got up and left the room, but she did not herself\ngo up to her cousin. She felt that she could not see Margaret without\nsaying something of what had passed between herself and Sir John,\nand that it would be better that nothing should be said. So she went\naway to her own room, and dispatched her maid to send the lamb to the\nlion. Nevertheless, it was not without compunction, some twang of\nfeminine conscience, that Mrs Mackenzie gave up this opportunity\nof saying some last important word, and perhaps doing some last\nimportant little act with regard to those nicenesses of which she\nthought perhaps too much. Mrs Mackenzie's philosophy was not without\nits truth; but a man of fifty should not be made to marry a woman\nby muslin and starch, if he be not prepared to marry her on other\nconsiderations.\n\nWhen the message came, Margaret thought nothing of the muslin and\nstarch. The bonnet that had been worth its weight in gold, and the\nblack-freckled dress, were all forgotten. But she thought of the\nwords which her cousin John had spoken to her as soon as they had\ngot through the little gate into the grounds of the Cedars when they\nhad walked back together from the railway station at Twickenham; and\nshe remembered that she had then pledged herself to be firm. If he\nalluded to the offer he had then made, and repeated it, she would\nthrow herself into his arms at once, and tell him that she would\nserve him with all her heart and all her strength as long as God\nmight leave them together. But she was quite as strongly determined\nto accept from him for herself no other kind of provision. That money\nwhich for a short while had been hers was now his; and she could\nhave no claim upon him unless he gave her the claim of a wife. After\nwhat had passed between them she would not be the recipient of his\ncharity. Certain words had been written and spoken from which she had\ngathered the existence, in Mr Slow's mind, of some such plan as this.\nHis client should lose her cause meekly and graciously, and should\nthen have a claim for alms. That had been the idea on which Mr Slow\nhad worked. She had long made up her mind that Mr Slow should be\ntaught to know her better, if the day for such offering of alms\nshould ever come. Perhaps it had come now. She took up a little scarf\nthat she wore ordinarily and folded it tight across her shoulders,\nquite forgetful of muslin and starch, as she descended to the\ndrawing-room in order that this question might be solved for her.\n\nSir John met her almost at the door as she entered.\n\n\"I'm afraid you've been expecting me to come sooner,\" he said.\n\n\"No, indeed; I was not quite sure that you would come at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I was certain to come. You have hardly received as yet any\nofficial notification that your cause has been lost.\"\n\n\"It was not my cause, John,\" she said, smiling, \"and I received no\nother notification than what I got through Mrs Mackenzie. Indeed, as\nyou know, I have regarded this law business as nonsense all through.\nSince what you and Mr Slow told me, I have known that the property\nwas yours.\"\n\n\"But it was quite necessary to have a judgment.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, and there's an end of it. I, for one, am not in the\nleast disappointed,--if it will give you any comfort to know that.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that any other woman in England would have lost her\nfortune with the equanimity that you have shown.\"\n\nShe could not explain to him that, in the first days of dismay caused\nby that misfortune, he had given her such consolation as to make her\nforget her loss, and that her subsequent misery had been caused by\nthe withdrawal of that consolation. She could not tell him that the\nvery memory of her money had been, as it were, drowned by other hopes\nin life,--by other hopes and by other despair. But when he praised\nher for her equanimity, she thought of this. She still smiled as she\nheard his praise.\n\n\"I suppose I ought to return the compliment,\" she said, \"and declare\nthat no cousin who had been kept so long out of his own money\never behaved so well as you have done. I can assure you that I\nhave thought of it very often,--of the injustice that has been\ninvoluntarily done to you.\"\n\n\"It has been unjust, has it not?\" said he, piteously, thinking of his\ninjuries. \"So much of it has gone in that oilcloth business, and all\nfor nothing!\"\n\n\"I'm glad at any rate that Walter's share did not go.\"\n\nHe knew that this was not the kind of conversation which he had\ndesired to commence, and that it must be changed before anything\ncould be settled. So he shook himself and began again.\n\n\"And now, Margaret, as the lawyers have finished their part of the\nbusiness, ours must begin.\"\n\nShe had been standing hitherto and had felt herself to be strong\nenough to stand, but at the sound of these words her knees had become\nweak under her, and she found a retreat upon the sofa. Of course she\nsaid nothing as he came and stood over her.\n\n\"I hope you have understood,\" he continued, \"that while all this was\ngoing on I could propose no arrangement of any kind.\"\n\n\"I know you have been very much troubled.\"\n\n\"Indeed I have. It seems that any blackguard has a right to publish\nany lies that he likes about any one in any of the newspapers, and\nthat nobody can do anything to protect himself! Sometimes I have\nthought that it would drive me mad!\"\n\nBut he again perceived that he was getting out of the right course in\nthus dwelling upon his own injuries. He had come there to alleviate\nher misfortunes, not to talk about his own.\n\n\"It is no good, however, talking about all that; is it, Margaret?\"\n\n\"It will cease now, will it not?\"\n\n\"I cannot say. I fear not. Whichever way I turn, they abuse me for\nwhat I do. What business is it of theirs?\"\n\n\"You mean their absurd story--calling you a lion.\"\n\n\"Don't talk of it, Margaret.\"\n\nThen Margaret was again silent. She by no means wished to talk of the\nstory, if he would only leave it alone.\n\n\"And now about you.\"\n\nThen he came and sat beside her, and she put her hand back behind\nthe cushion on the sofa so as to save herself from trembling in his\npresence. She need not have cared much, for, let her tremble ever so\nmuch, he had then no capacity for perceiving it.\n\n\"Come, Margaret; I want to do what is best for us both. How shall it\nbe?\"\n\n\"John, you have children, and you should do what is best for them.\"\n\nThen there was a pause again, and when he spoke after a while, he was\nlooking down at the floor and poking among the pattern on the carpet\nwith his stick.\n\n\"Margaret, when I first asked you to marry me, you refused me.\"\n\n\"I did,\" said she; \"and then all the property was mine.\"\n\n\"But afterwards you said you would have me.\"\n\n\"Yes; and when you asked me the second time I had nothing. I know all\nthat.\"\n\n\"I thought nothing about the money then. I mean that I never thought\nyou refused me because you were rich and took me because you were\npoor. I was not at all unhappy about that when we were walking round\nthe shrubbery. But when I thought you had cared for that man--\"\n\n\"I had never cared for him,\" said Margaret, withdrawing her hand from\nbehind the pillow in her energy, and fearing no longer that she might\ntremble. \"I had never cared for him. He is a false man, and told\nuntruths to my aunt.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is, a liar,--a damnable liar. That is true at any rate.\"\n\n\"He is beneath your notice, John, and beneath mine. I will not speak\nof him.\"\n\nSir John, however, had an idea that when he felt the wasp's venom\nthrough all his blood, the wasp could not be altogether beneath his\nnotice.\n\n\"The question is,\" said he, speaking between his teeth, and hardly\npronouncing his words, \"the question is whether you care for me.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said she turning round upon him; and as she did so our\nGriselda took both his hands in hers. \"I do, John. I do care for you.\nI love you better than all the world besides. Whom else have I to\nlove at all? If you choose to think it mean of me, now that I am so\npoor, I cannot help it. But who was it told me to be firm? Who was it\ntold me? Who was it told me?\"\n\nLady Ball had lost her game, and Mrs Mackenzie had been a true\nprophet. Mrs Mackenzie had been one of those prophets who knew how to\nassist the accomplishment of their own prophecies, and Lady Ball had\nplayed her game with very indifferent skill. Sir John endeavoured to\nsay a word as to that other alternative that he had to offer, but the\nlamb was not lamb-like enough to listen to it. I doubt even whether\nMargaret knew, when at night she thought over the affairs of the day,\nthat any such offer had been made to her. During the rest of the\ninterview she was by far the greatest talker, and she would not rest\ntill she had made him swear that he believed her when she said, that\nboth in rejecting him and accepting him, she had been guided simply\nby her affection. \"You know, John,\" she said, \"a woman can't love a\nman all at once.\"\n\nThey had been together for the best part of two hours, when Mrs\nMackenzie knocked at the door. \"May I come in?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"And may I ask a question?\" She knew by the tone of her cousin's\nvoice that no question could come amiss.\n\n\"You must ask him,\" said Margaret, coming to her and kissing her.\n\n\"But, first of all,\" said Mrs Mackenzie, shutting the door and\nassuming a very serious countenance, \"I have news of my own to tell.\nThere is a gentleman downstairs in the dining-room who has sent up\nword that he wants to see me. He says he is a clergyman.\"\n\nThen Sir John Ball ceased to smile, and look foolish, but doubled his\nfist, and went towards the door.\n\n\"Who is it?\" said Margaret, whispering.\n\n\"I have not heard his name, but from the servant's account of him I\nhave not much doubt myself; I suppose he comes from Littlebath. You\ncan go down to him, if you like, Sir John; but I would not advise\nit.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Margaret, clinging to his arm, \"you shall not go down.\nWhat good can you do? He is beneath you. If you beat him he will have\nthe law of you--and he is a clergyman. If you do not, he will only\nrevile you, and make you wretched.\" Thus between the two ladies the\nbaronet was restrained.\n\nIt was Mr Maguire. Having learned from his ally, Miss Colza, that\nMargaret was staying with her cousins in Cavendish Square, he had\nresolved upon calling on Mrs Mackenzie, and forcing his way, if\npossible, into Margaret's presence. Things were not going well\nwith him at Littlebath, and in his despair he had thought that the\nbest chance to him of carrying on the fight lay in this direction.\nThen there was a course of embassies between the dining-room and\ndrawing-room in the Mackenzie mansion. The servant was sent to ask\nthe gentleman his name, and the gentleman sent up to say that he was\na clergyman,--that his name was not known to Mrs Mackenzie, but that\nhe wanted to see her most particularly for a few minutes on very\nspecial business. Then the servant was despatched to ask him whether\nor no he was the Rev. Jeremiah Maguire, of Littlebath, and under this\ncompulsion he sent back word that such was his designation. He was\nthen told to go. Upon that he wrote a note to Mrs Mackenzie, setting\nforth that he had a private communication to make, much to the\nadvantage of her cousin, Miss Margaret Mackenzie. He was again told\nto go; and then told again, that if he did not leave the house at\nonce, the assistance of the police would be obtained. Then he went.\n\"And it was frightful to behold him,\" said the servant, coming up for\nthe tenth time. But the servant no doubt enjoyed the play, and on one\noccasion presumed to remark that he did not think any reference to\nthe police was necessary. \"Such a game as we've had up!\" he said to\nthe coachman that afternoon in the kitchen.\n\nAnd the game that they had in the drawing-room was not a bad game\neither. When Mr Maguire would not go, the two women joined in\nlaughing, till at last the tears ran down Mrs Mackenzie's face.\n\n\"Only think of our being kept prisoners here by a one-eyed\nclergyman.\"\n\n\"He has got two eyes,\" said Margaret. \"If he had ten he shan't see\nus.\"\n\nAnd at last Sir John laughed; and as he laughed he came and stood\nnear Margaret; and once he got his arm round her waist, and Griselda\nwas very happy. At the present moment she was quite indifferent to Mr\nMaguire and any mode of fighting that he might adopt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThings had not been going well with Mr Maguire when, as a last\nchance, he attempted to force an entrance into Mrs Mackenzie's\ndrawing-room. Things, indeed, had been going very badly with him. Mr\nStumfold at Littlebath had had an interview with the editor of the\n_Christian Examiner_, and had made that provincial Jupiter understand\nthat he must drop the story of the Lion and the Lamb. There had\nbeen more than enough of it, Mr Stumfold thought; and if it were\ncontinued, Mr Stumfold would--would make Littlebath too hot to hold\nthe _Christian Examiner_. That was the full meaning of Mr Stumfold's\nthreat; and, as the editor knew Mr Stumfold's power, the editor\nwisely turned a cold shoulder upon Mr Maguire. When Mr Maguire came\nto the editor with his letter for publication, the editor declared\nthat he should be happy to insert it--as an advertisement. Then there\nhad been a little scene between Mr Maguire and the editor, and Mr\nMaguire had left the editorial office shaking the dust from off his\nfeet. But he was a persistent man, and, having ascertained that Miss\nColza was possessed of some small share in her brother's business\nin the city, he thought it expedient to betake himself again to\nLondon. He did so, as we have seen; and with some very faint hope of\nobtaining collateral advantage for himself, and some stronger hope\nthat he might still be able to do an injury to Sir John Ball, he went\nto the Mackenzies' house in Cavendish Square. There his success was\nnot great; and from that time forward the wasp had no further power\nof inflicting stings upon the lion whom he had persecuted.\n\nBut some further annoyance he did give to Griselda. He managed to\ninduce Mrs Tom Mackenzie to take him in as a lodger in Gower Street,\nand Margaret very nearly ran into his way in her anxiety to befriend\nher sister-in-law. Luckily she heard from Mr Rubb that he was there\non the very day on which she had intended to visit Gower Street. Poor\nMrs Mackenzie got the worst of it; for of course Mr Maguire did not\npay for his lodgings. But he did marry Miss Colza, and in some way\ngot himself instituted to a chapel at Islington. There we will leave\nhim, not trusting much in his connubial bliss, but faintly hoping\nthat his teaching may be favourable to the faith and morals of his\nnew flock.\n\nOf Mr Samuel Rubb, junior, we must say a few words. His first\nacquaintance with our heroine was not made under circumstances\nfavourable to him. In that matter of the loan, he departed very\nwidely from the precept which teaches us that honesty is the best\npolicy. And when I feel that our Margaret was at one time really in\ndanger of becoming Mrs Rubb,--that in her ignorance of the world, in\nthe dark gropings of her social philosophy, amidst the difficulties\nof her solitude, she had not known whether she could do better with\nherself and her future years, than give herself, and them, and her\nmoney to Mr Samuel Rubb, I tremble as I look back upon her danger. It\nhas been said of women that they have an insane desire for matrimony.\nI believe that the desire, even if it be as general as is here\ndescribed, is no insanity. But when I see such a woman as Margaret\nMackenzie in danger from such a man as Samuel Rubb, junior, I am\ndriven to fear that there may sometimes be a maniacal tendency. But\nSamuel Rubb was by no means a bad man. He first hankered after the\nwoman's money, but afterwards he had loved the woman; and my female\nreader, if she agrees with me, will feel that that virtue covers a\nmultitude of sins.\n\nAnd he was true to the promise that he made about the loan. He did\npay the interest of the money regularly to Mrs Mackenzie in Gower\nStreet, and after a while was known in that house as the recognised\nlover of Mary Jane, the eldest daughter. In this way it came to pass\nthat he occasionally saw the lady to whose hand he had aspired; for\nMargaret, when she was assured that Mr Maguire and his bride were\nnever likely to be seen in that locality, did not desert her nephews\nand nieces in Gower Street.\n\nBut we must go back to Sir John Ball. As soon as the coast was clear\nin Cavendish Square, he took his leave of Margaret. Mrs Mackenzie had\nleft the room, desiring to speak a word to him alone as he came down.\n\n\"I shall tell my mother to-night,\" he said to Margaret. \"You know\nthat all this is not exactly as she wishes it.\"\n\n\"John,\" she said, \"if it is as you wish it, I have no right to think\nof anything beyond that.\"\n\n\"It is as I wish it,\" said he.\n\n\"Then tell my aunt, with my love, that I shall hope that she will\nreceive me as her daughter.\"\n\nThen they parted, and Margaret was left alone to congratulate herself\nover her success.\n\n\"Sir John,\" said Mrs Mackenzie, calling him into the drawing-room;\n\"you must hear my congratulations; you must, indeed.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said he, looking foolish; \"you are very good.\"\n\n\"And so is she. She is what you may really call good. She is as good\nas gold. I know a woman when I see her; and I know that for one like\nher there are fifty not fit to hold a candle to her. She has nothing\nmean or little about her--nothing. They may call her a lamb, but she\ncan be a lioness too when there is an occasion.\"\n\n\"I know that she is steadfast,\" said he.\n\n\"That she is, and honest, and warm hearted; and--and Oh! Sir John,\nI am so happy that it is all to be made right, and nice, and\ncomfortable. It would have been very sad if she hadn't gone with the\nmoney; would it not?\"\n\n\"I should not have taken the money--not all of it.\"\n\n\"And she would not have taken any. She would not have taken a penny\nof it, though we need not mind that now; need we? But there is one\nthing I want to say; you must not think I am interfering.\"\n\n\"I shan't think that after all that you have done.\"\n\n\"I want her to be married from here. It would be quite proper;\nwouldn't it? Mr Mackenzie is a little particular about the grouse,\nbecause there is to be a large party at Incharrow; but up to the 10th\nof August you and she should fix any day you like.\"\n\nSir John showed by his countenance that he was somewhat taken aback.\nThe 10th of August, and here they were far advanced into June! When\nhe had left home this morning he had not fully made up his mind\nwhether he meant to marry his cousin or not; and now, within a few\nhours, he was being confined to weeks and days! Mrs Mackenzie saw\nwhat was passing in his mind; but she was not a woman to be driven\neasily from her purpose.\n\n\"You see,\" she said, \"there is so much to think of. What is Margaret\nto do, if we leave her in London when we go down? And it would really\nbe better for her to be married from her cousin's house; it would,\nindeed. Lady Ball would like it better--I'm sure she would--than if\nshe were to be living alone in the town in lodgings. There is always\na way of doing things; isn't there? And Walter's sisters, her own\ncousins, could be her bridesmaids, you know.\"\n\nSir John said that he would think about it.\n\n\"I haven't spoken to her, of course,\" said Mrs Mackenzie; \"but I\nshall now.\"\n\nSir John, as he went eastwards into the city, did think about it;\nand before he had reached his own house that evening, he had brought\nhimself to regard Mrs Mackenzie's scheme in a favourable light. He\nwas not blind to the advantage of taking his wife from a house in\nCavendish Square, instead of from lodgings in Arundel Street; and\nhe was aware that his mother would not be blind to that advantage\neither. He did not hope to be able to reconcile her to his marriage\nat once; and perhaps he entertained some faint idea that for the\nfirst six months of his new married life the Cedars would be quite as\npleasant without his mother as with her; but a final reconciliation\nwould be more easy if he and his wife had the Mackenzies of Incharrow\nto back them, than it could be without such influence. And as for the\nLondon gossip of the thing, the finale to the romance of the Lion and\nthe Lamb, it would be sure to come sooner or later. Let them have\ntheir odious joke and have done with it!\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, as soon as he could find himself alone with Lady\nBall that day, not waiting for the midnight conference; \"mother, I\nmay as well tell you at once. I have proposed to Margaret Mackenzie\nagain to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh! very well.\"\n\n\"And she has accepted me.\"\n\n\"Accepted you! of course she has; jumped at the chance, no doubt.\nWhat else should a pauper do?\"\n\n\"Mother, that is ungenerous.\"\n\n\"She did not accept you when she had got anything.\"\n\n\"If I can reconcile myself to that, surely you can do so. The matter\nis settled now, and I think I have done the best in my power for\nmyself and my children.\"\n\n\"And as for your mother, she may go and die anywhere.\"\n\n\"Mother, that is unfair. As long as I have a house over my head,\nyou shall share it, if you please to do so. If it suits you to go\nelsewhere, I will be with you as often as may be possible. I hope,\nhowever, you will not leave us.\"\n\n\"That I shall certainly do.\"\n\n\"Then I hope you will not go far from me.\"\n\n\"And when is it to be?\" said his mother, after a pause.\n\n\"I cannot name any day; but some time before the 10th of August.\"\n\n\"Before the 10th of August! Why, that is at once. Oh! John; and your\nfather not dead a year!\"\n\n\"Margaret has a home now with her cousins in Cavendish Square; but\nshe cannot stay there after they go to Scotland. It will be for her\nwelfare that she should be married from their house. And as for my\nfather's death, I know that you do not suspect me of disrespect to\nhis memory.\"\n\nAnd in this way it was settled at the Cedars; and his mother's\nquestion about the time drove him to the resolution which he himself\nhad not reached. When next he was in Cavendish Square he asked\nMargaret whether she could be ready so soon, and she replied that she\nwould be ready on any day that he told her to be ready.\n\nThus it was settled, and with a moderate amount of nuptial\nfestivity the marriage feast was prepared in Mrs Mackenzie's house.\nMargaret was surprised to find how many dear friends she had who\nwere interested in her welfare. Miss Baker wrote to her most\naffectionately; and Miss Todd was warm in her congratulations. But\nthe attention which perhaps surprised her most was a warm letter of\nsisterly affection from Mrs Stumfold, in which that lady rejoiced\nwith an exceeding joy in that the machinations of a certain wolf in\nsheep's clothing had been unsuccessful. \"My anxiety that you should\nnot be sacrificed I once before evinced to you,\" said Mrs Stumfold;\n\"and within the last two months Mr Stumfold has been at work to put\nan end to the scurrilous writings which that wolf in sheep's clothing\nhas been putting into the newspapers.\" Then Mrs Stumfold very\nparticularly desired to be remembered to Sir John Ball, and expressed\na hope that, at some future time, she might have the honour of being\nmade acquainted with \"the worthy baronet.\"\n\nThey were married in the first week in August, and our modern\nGriselda went through the ceremony with much grace. That there was\nmuch grace about Sir John Ball, I cannot say; but gentlemen, when\nthey get married at fifty, are not expected to be graceful.\n\n\"There, my Lady Ball,\" said Mrs Mackenzie, whispering into her\ncousin's ear before they left the church; \"now my prophecy has come\ntrue; and when we meet in London next spring, you will reward me for\nall I have done for you by walking out of a room before me.\"\n\nBut all these honours, and, what was better, all the happiness that\ncame in her way, Lady Ball accepted thankfully, quietly, and with an\nenduring satisfaction, as it became such a woman to do.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MISS MACKENZIE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 24000-8.txt or 24000-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/4\/0\/0\/24000\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":295,"split":"train"}
