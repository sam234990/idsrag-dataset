Fiercely Jacobin, Marat and Robespierre's most faithful adherent, \u0102\u0089variste Gamelin soon becomes a juror on the Revolutionary Tribunal.\nThe long, blind train of speedy trials drags this idealist into a madness that cuts off the heads of his nearest and dearest, and hastens his own fall as well as that of his mentor Robespierre in the aftermath of the Thermidorian Reaction. His love affair with the young watercolor-seller \u0102\u0089lodie Blaise heightens the terrible contrast between the butcher-in-training and the man who shows himself to be quite ordinary in his daily life.\nJustifying this dance of the guillotine by the fight against the plot to wipe out the gains of the Revolution, in the midst of the revolutionary turmoil that traverses Paris, Gamelin is thirsty for justice, but also uses his power to satisfy his own vengeance and his hatred for those who do not think like him. He dies by that same instrument of justice that up until then has served to satisfy his own thirst for blood and terror.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gods are Athirst, by Anatole France\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The church stood in a narrow, gloomy square,\nnot far from the gates of the Palais de Justice. On the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, which\nconsisted of two of the Classical orders superimposed and was decorated\nwith inverted brackets and flaming urns, blackened by the weather and\ndisfigured by the hand of man, the religious emblems had been battered\nto pieces, while above the doorway had been inscribed in black letters\nthe Republican catchword of \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity or Death.\"\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin made his way into the nave; the same vaults which had\nheard the surpliced clerks of the Congregation of St. Paul sing the\ndivine offices, now looked down on red-capped patriots assembled to\nelect the Municipal magistrates and deliberate on the affairs of the\nSection. The Saints had been dragged from their niches and replaced by\nthe busts of Brutus, Jean-Jacques and Le Peltier. The altar had been\nstripped bare and was surmounted by the Table of the Rights of Man.\n\nIt was here in the nave that twice a week, from five in the evening to\neleven, were held the public assemblies. The pulpit, decorated with the\ncolours of the Nation, served as tribune for the speakers who harangued\nthe meeting. Opposite, on the Epistle side, rose a platform of rough\nplanks, for the accommodation of the women and children, who attended\nthese gatherings in considerable numbers.\n\nOn this particular morning, facing a desk planted underneath the pulpit,\nsat in red cap and _carmagnole_ complete the joiner from the Place\nThionville, the _citoyen_ Dupont senior, one of the twelve forming the\nCommittee of Surveillance. On the desk stood a bottle and glasses, an\nink-horn, and a folio containing the text of the petition urging the\nConvention to expel from its bosom the twenty-two members deemed\nunworthy.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin took the pen and signed.\n\n\"I was sure,\" said the carpenter and magistrate, \"I was sure you would\ncome and give in your name, _citoyen_ Gamelin. You are the real thing.\nBut the Section is lukewarm; it is lacking in virtue. I have proposed to\nthe Committee of Surveillance to deliver no certificate of citizenship\nto any one who has failed to sign the petition.\"\n\n\"I am ready to sign with my blood,\" said Gamelin, \"for the proscription\nof these federalists, these traitors. They have desired the death of\nMarat: let them perish.\"\n\n\"What ruins us,\" replied Dupont senior, \"is indifferentism. In a Section\nwhich contains nine hundred citizens with the right to vote there are\nnot fifty attend the assembly. Yesterday we were eight and twenty.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Gamelin, \"citizens must be obliged to come under\npenalty of a fine.\"\n\n\"Oh, ho!\" exclaimed the joiner frowning, \"but if they all came, the\npatriots would be in a minority.... _Citoyen_ Gamelin, will you drink a\nglass of wine to the health of all good sansculottes?...\"\n\nOn the wall of the church, on the Gospel side, could be read the words,\naccompanied by a black hand, the forefinger pointing to the passage\nleading to the cloisters: \"_Comit\u00c3\u00a9 civil, Comit\u00c3\u00a9 de surveillance, Comit\u00c3\u00a9\nde bienfaisance._\" A few yards further on, you came to the door of the\nerstwhile sacristy, over which was inscribed: _Comit\u00c3\u00a9 militaire_.\n\nGamelin pushed this door open and found the Secretary of the Committee\nwithin; he was writing at a large table loaded with books, papers, steel\ningots, cartridges and samples of saltpetre-bearing soils.\n\n\"Greeting, _citoyen_ Trubert. How are you?\"\n\n\"I?... I am perfectly well.\"\n\nThe Secretary of the Military Committee, Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 Trubert, invariably\nmade this same reply to all who troubled about his health, less by way\nof informing them of his welfare than to cut short any discussion on the\nsubject. At twenty-eight, he had a parched skin, thin hair, hectic\ncheeks and bent shoulders. He was an optician on the Quai des Orf\u00c3\u00a8vres,\nand owned a very old house which he had given up in '91 to a\nsuperannuated clerk in order to devote his energies to the discharge of\nhis municipal duties. His mother, a charming woman, whose memory a few\nold men of the neighbourhood still cherished fondly, had died at twenty;\nshe had left him her fine eyes, full of gentleness and passion, her\npallor and timidity. From his father, optician and mathematical\ninstrument maker to the King, carried off by the same complaint before\nhis thirtieth year, he inherited an upright character and an industrious\ntemperament.\n\nWithout stopping his writing:\n\n\"And you, _citoyen_,\" he asked, \"how are you?\"\n\n\"Very well. Anything new?\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing. You can see,--we are all quiet here.\"\n\n\"And the situation?\"\n\n\"The situation is just the same.\"\n\nThe situation was appalling. The finest army of the Republic blockaded\nin Mayence; Valenciennes besieged; Fontenay taken by the Vend\u00c3\u00a9ens; Lyons\nrebellious; the C\u00c3\u00a9vennes in insurrection, the frontier open to the\nSpaniards; two-thirds of the Departments invaded or revolted; Paris\nhelpless before the Austrian cannon, without money, without bread!\n\nFortun\u00c3\u00a9 Trubert wrote on calmly. The Sections being instructed by\nresolution of the Commune to carry out the levy of twelve thousand men\nfor La Vend\u00c3\u00a9e, he was drawing up directions relating to the enrolment\nand arming of the contingent which the \"Pont-Neuf,\" erstwhile \"Henri\nIV,\" was to supply. All the muskets in store were to be handed over to\nthe men requisitioned for the front; the National Guard of the Section\nwould be armed with fowling-pieces and pikes.\n\n\"I have brought you here,\" said Gamelin, \"the schedule of the\nchurch-bells to be sent to the Luxembourg to be converted into cannon.\"\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin, albeit he had not a penny, was inscribed among the\nactive members of the Section; the law accorded this privilege only to\nsuch citizens as were rich enough to pay a contribution equivalent in\namount to three days' work, and demanded a ten days' contribution to\nqualify an elector for office. But the Section du Pont-Neuf, enamoured\nof equality and jealous of its independence, regarded as qualified both\nfor the vote and for office every citizen who had paid out of his own\npocket for his National Guard's uniform. This was Gamelin's case, who\nwas an _active_ citizen of his Section and member of the Military\nCommittee.\n\nFortun\u00c3\u00a9 Trubert laid down his pen:\n\n\"_Citoyen_ \u00c3\u0089variste,\" he said, \"I beg you to go to the Convention and\nask them to send us orders to dig up the floor of cellars, to wash the\nsoil and flag-stones and collect the saltpetre. It is not everything to\nhave guns, we must have gunpowder too.\"\n\nA little hunchback, a pen behind his ear and a bundle of papers in his\nhand, entered the erstwhile sacristy. It was the _citoyen_ Beauvisage,\nof the Committee of Surveillance.\n\n\"_Citoyens_,\" he announced, \"we have bad news: Custine has evacuated\nLandau.\"\n\n\"Custine is a traitor!\" cried Gamelin.\n\n\"He shall be guillotined,\" said Beauvisage.\n\nTrubert, in his rather breathless voice, expressed himself with his\nhabitual calmness:\n\n\"The Convention has not instituted a Committee of Public Safety for fun.\nIt will enquire into Custine's conduct. Incompetent or traitor, he will\nbe superseded by a General resolved to win the victory,--and _\u00c3\u00a7a ira!_\"\n\nHe turned over a heap of papers, scrutinizing them with his tired eyes:\n\n\"That our soldiers may do their duty with a quiet mind and stout heart,\nthey must be assured that the lot of those they leave behind at home is\nsafeguarded. If you are of the same opinion, _citoyen_ Gamelin, you will\njoin me in demanding, at the next assembly, that the Committee of\nBenevolence concert measures with the Military Committee to succour the\nfamilies that are in indigence and have a relative at the front.\"\n\nHe smiled and hummed to himself: \"_\u00c3\u0087a ira! \u00c3\u00a7a ira!..._\"\n\nWorking twelve and fourteen hours a day at his table of unpainted deal\nfor the defence of the fatherland in peril, this humble Secretary of the\nSectional Committee could see no disproportion between the immensity of\nthe task and the meagreness of his means for performing it, so filled\nwas he with a sense of the unity in a common effort between himself and\nall other patriots, so intimately did he feel himself one with the\nNation at large, so merged was his individual life in the life of a\ngreat People. He was of the sort who combine enthusiasm with\nlong-suffering, who, after each check, set about organizing the victory\nthat is impossible, but is bound to come. And verily they _must_ win the\nday. These men of no account, who had destroyed Royalty and upset the\nold order of things, this Trubert, a penniless optician, this \u00c3\u0089variste\nGamelin, an unknown dauber, could expect no mercy from their enemies.\nThey had no choice save between victory and death. Hence both their\nfervour and their serenity.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nQuitting the Barnabites, \u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin set off in the direction of\nthe Place Dauphine, now renamed the Place de Thionville in honour of a\ncity that had shown itself impregnable.\n\nSituated in the busiest quarter of Paris, the _Place_ had long lost the\nfine stateliness it had worn a hundred years ago; the mansions forming\nits three sides, built in the days of Henri IV in one uniform style, of\nred brick with white stone dressings, to lodge splendour-loving\nmagistrates, had had their imposing roofs of slate removed to make way\nfor two or three wretched storeys of lath and plaster or had even been\ndemolished altogether and replaced by shabby whitewashed houses, and now\ndisplayed only a series of irregular, poverty-stricken, squalid fronts,\npierced with countless narrow, unevenly spaced windows enlivened with\nflowers in pots, birdcages, and rags hanging out to dry. These were\noccupied by a swarm of artisans, jewellers, metal-workers, clockmakers,\nopticians, printers, laundresses, sempstresses, milliners, and a few\ngrey-beard lawyers who had not been swept away in the storm of\nrevolution along with the King's courts.\n\nIt was morning and springtime. Golden sunbeams, intoxicating as new\nwine, played on the walls and flashed gaily in at garret casements.\nEvery sash of every window was thrown open, showing the housewives'\nfrowsy heads peeping out. The Clerk of the Revolutionary Tribunal, who\nhad just left his house on his way to Court, distributed amicable taps\non the cheeks of the children playing under the trees. From the\nPont-Neuf came the crier's voice denouncing the treason of the infamous\nDumouriez.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin lived in a house on the side towards the Quai de\nl'Horloge, a house that dated from Henri IV and would still have\npreserved a not unhandsome appearance but for a mean tiled attic that\nhad been added on to heighten the building under the last but one of the\n_tyrants_. To adapt the lodging of some erstwhile dignitary of the\n_Parlement_ to the exigencies of the bourgeois and artisan households\nthat formed its present denizens, endless partitions and false floors\nhad been run up. This was why the _citoyen_ Remacle, concierge and\njobbing tailor, perched in a sort of 'tween-decks, as low ceilinged as\nit was confined in area. Here he could be seen through the glass door\nsitting cross-legged on his work-bench, his bowed back within an inch of\nthe floor above, stitching away at a National Guard's uniform, while the\n_citoyenne_ Remacle, whose cooking stove boasted no chimney but the well\nof the staircase, poisoned the other tenants with the fumes of her\nstew-pots and frying-pans, and their little girl Jos\u00c3\u00a9phine, her face\nsmudged with treacle and looking as pretty as an angel, played on the\nthreshold with Mouton, the joiner's dog. The _citoyenne_, whose heart\nwas as capacious as her ample bosom and broad back, was reputed to\nbestow her favours on her neighbour the _citoyen_ Dupont senior, who was\none of the twelve constituting the Committee of Surveillance. At any\nrate her husband had his strong suspicions, and from morning to night\nthe house resounded with the racket of the alternate squabbles and\nreconciliations of the pair. The upper floors were occupied by the\n_citoyen_ Chaperon, gold and silver-smith, who had his shop on the Quai\nde l'Horloge, by a health officer, an attorney, a goldbeater, and\nseveral employ\u00c3\u00a9s at the Palais de Justice.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin climbed the old-fashioned staircase as far as the\nfourth and last storey, where he had his studio together with a bedroom\nfor his mother. At this point ended the wooden stairs laid with tiles\nthat took the place of the grand stairway of the more important floors.\nA ladder clamped to the wall led to a cock-loft, from which at that\nmoment emerged a stout man with a handsome, florid, rosy-cheeked face,\nclimbing painfully down with an enormous package clasped in his arms,\nyet humming gaily to himself: _J'ai perdu mon serviteur_.\n\nBreaking off his song, he wished a polite good-day to Gamelin, who\nreturned him a fraternal greeting and helped him down with his parcel,\nfor which the old man thanked him.\n\n\"There,\" said he, shouldering his burden again, \"you have a batch of\ndancing-dolls which I am going to deliver straight away to a\ntoy-merchant in the Rue de la Loi. There is a whole tribe of them\ninside; I am their creator; they have received of me a perishable body,\nexempt from joys and sufferings. I have not given them the gift of\nthought, for I am a benevolent God.\"\n\nIt was the _citoyen_ Brotteaux, once farmer of taxes and _ci-devant_\nnoble; his father, having made a fortune in these transactions, had\nbought himself an office conferring a title on the possessor. In the\ngood old times Maurice Brotteaux had called himself Monsieur des Ilettes\nand used to give elegant suppers which the fair Madame de Rochemaure,\nwife of a King's _procureur_, enlivened with her bright glances,--a\nfinished gentlewoman whose loyal fidelity was never impugned so long as\nthe Revolution left Maurice Brotteaux in possession of his offices and\nemoluments, his h\u00c3\u00b4tel, his estates and his noble name. The Revolution\nswept them all away. He made his living by painting portraits under the\narchways of doors, making pancakes and fritters on the Quai de la\nM\u00c3\u00a9gisserie, composing speeches for the representatives of the people and\ngiving dancing lessons to the young _citoyennes_. At the present time,\nin his garret into which you climbed by a ladder and where a man could\nnot stand upright, Maurice Brotteaux, the proud owner of a glue-pot, a\nball of twine, a box of water-colours and sundry clippings of paper,\nmanufactured dancing-dolls which he sold to wholesale toy-dealers, who\nresold them to the pedlars who hawked them up and down the\nChamps-\u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es at the end of a pole,--glittering magnets to draw the\nlittle ones' eyes. Amidst the calamities of the State and the disaster\nthat overwhelmed himself, he preserved an unruffled spirit, reading for\nthe refreshment of his mind in his Lucretius, which he carried with him\nwherever he went in the gaping pocket of his plum-coloured surtout.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin pushed open the door of his lodging. It offered no\nresistance, for his poverty spared him any trouble about lock and key;\nwhen his mother from force of habit shot the bolt, he would tell her:\n\"Why, what's the good? Folks don't steal spiders'-webs,--nor my\npictures, neither.\" In his workroom were piled, under a thick layer of\ndust or with faces turned to the wall, the canvases of his student\nyears,--when, as the fashion of the day was, he limned scenes of\ngallantry, depicting with a sleek, timorous brush emptied quivers and\nbirds put to flight, risky pastimes and reveries of bliss, high-kilted\ngoose-girls and shepherdesses with rose-wreathed bosoms.\n\nBut it was not a genre that suited his temperament. His cold treatment\nof such like scenes proved the painter's incurable purity of heart.\nAmateurs were right: Gamelin had no gifts as an erotic artist. Nowadays,\nthough he was still short of thirty, these subjects struck him as dating\nfrom an immemorial antiquity. He saw in them the degradation wrought by\nMonarchy, the shameful effects of the corruption of Courts. He blamed\nhimself for having practised so contemptible a style and prostituted his\ngenius to the vile arts of slavery. Now, citizen of a free people, he\noccupied his hand with bold charcoal sketches of Liberties, Rights of\nMan, French Constitutions, Republican Virtues, the People as Hercules\nfelling the Hydra of Tyranny, throwing into each and all his\ncompositions all the fire of his patriotism. Alas! he could not make a\nliving by it. The times were hard for artists. No doubt the fault did\nnot lie with the Convention, which was hurling its armies against the\nkings gathered on every frontier, which, proud, unmoved, determined in\nthe face of the coalesced powers of Europe, false and ruthless to\nitself, was rending its own bosom with its own hands, which was setting\nup terror as the order of the day, establishing for the punishment of\nplotters a pitiless tribunal to whose devouring maw it was soon to\ndeliver up its own members; but which through it all, with calm and\nthoughtful brow, the patroness of science and friend of all things\nbeautiful, was reforming the calendar, instituting technical schools,\ndecreeing competitions in painting and sculpture, founding prizes to\nencourage artists, organizing annual exhibitions, opening the Museum of\nthe Louvre, and, on the model of Athens and Rome, endowing with a\nstately sublimity the celebration of National festivals and public\nobsequies. But French Art, once so widely appreciated in England, and\nGermany, in Russia, in Poland, now found every outlet to foreign lands\nclosed. Amateurs of painting, dilettanti of the fine arts, great\nnoblemen and financiers, were ruined, had emigrated or were in hiding.\nThe men the Revolution had enriched, peasants who had bought up National\nproperties, speculators, army-contractors, gamesters of the\nPalais-Royal, durst not at present show their wealth, and did not care a\nfig for pictures, either. It needed Regnault's fame or the youthful\nG\u00c3\u00a9rard's cleverness to sell a canvas. Greuze, Fragonard, Houin were\nreduced to indigence. Prud'hon could barely earn bread for his wife and\nchildren by drawing subjects which Copia reproduced in stippled\nengravings. The patriot painters Hennequin, Wicar, Topino-Lebrun were\nstarving. Gamelin, without means to meet the expenses of a picture, to\nhire a model or buy colours, abandoned his vast canvas of _The Tyrant\npursued in the Infernal Regions by the Furies_, after barely sketching\nin the main outlines. It blocked up half the studio with its\nhalf-finished, threatening shapes, greater than life-size, and its vast\nbrood of green snakes, each darting forth two sharp, forked tongues. In\nthe foreground, to the left, could be discerned Charon in his boat, a\nhaggard, wild-looking figure,--a powerful and well conceived design, but\nof the schools, schooly. There was far more of genius and less of\nartificiality in a canvas of smaller dimensions, also unfinished, that\nhung in the best lighted corner of the studio. It was an Orestes whom\nhis sister Electra was raising in her arms on his bed of pain. The\nmaiden was putting back with a moving tenderness the matted hair that\nhung over her brother's eyes. The head of the hero was tragic and fine,\nand you could see a likeness in it to the painter's own countenance.\n\nGamelin cast many a mournful look at this composition; sometimes his\nfingers itched with the craving to be at work on it, and his arms would\nbe stretched longingly towards the boldly sketched figure of Electra, to\nfall back again helpless to his sides. The artist was burning with\nenthusiasm, his soul aspired to great achievements. But he had to\nexhaust his energy on pot-boilers which he executed indifferently,\nbecause he was bound to please the taste of the vulgar and also because\nhe had no skill to impress trivial things with the seal of genius. He\ndrew little allegorical compositions which his comrade Desmahis engraved\ncleverly enough in black or in colours and which were bought at a low\nfigure by a print-dealer in the Rue Honor\u00c3\u00a9, the _citoyen_ Blaise. But\nthe trade was going from bad to worse, declared Blaise, who for some\ntime now had declined to purchase anything.\n\nThis time, however, made inventive by necessity, Gamelin had conceived a\nnew and happy thought, as _he_ at any rate believed,--an idea that was\nto make the print-seller's fortune, and the engraver's and his own to\nboot. This was a \"patriotic\" pack of cards, where for the kings and\nqueens and knaves of the old style he meant to substitute figures of\nGenius, of Liberty, of Equality and the like. He had already sketched\nout all his designs, had finished several and was eager to pass on to\nDesmahis such as were in a state to be engraved. The one he deemed the\nmost successful represented a soldier dressed in the three-cornered hat,\nblue coat with red facings, yellow breeches and black gaiters of the\nVolunteer, seated on a big drum, his feet on a pile of cannon-balls and\nhis musket between his knees. It was the _citizen of hearts_ replacing\nthe _ci-devant_ knave of hearts. For six months and more Gamelin had\nbeen drawing soldiers with never-failing gusto. He had sold some of\nthese while the fit of martial enthusiasm lasted, while others hung on\nthe walls of the room, and five or six, water-colours, colour-washes and\nchalks in two tints, lay about on the table and chairs. In the days of\nJuly, '92, when in every open space rose platforms for enrolling\nrecruits, when all the taverns were gay with green leaves and resounded\nto the shouts of \"Vive la Nation! freedom or death!\" Gamelin could not\ncross the Pont-Neuf or pass the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville without his heart beating\nhigh at sight of the beflagged marquee in which magistrates in tricolour\nscarves were inscribing the names of volunteers to the sound of the\n_Marseillaise_. But for him to join the Republic's armies would have\nmeant leaving his mother to starve.\n\nHeralded by a grievous sound of puffing and panting the old _citoyenne_,\nGamelin's widowed mother, entered the studio, hot, red and out of\nbreath, the National cockade hanging half unpinned in her cap and on the\npoint of falling out. She deposited her basket on a chair and still\nstanding, the better to get her breath, began to groan over the high\nprice of victuals.\n\nA shopkeeper's wife till the death of her husband, a cutler in the Rue\nde Grenelle-Saint-Germain, at the sign of the Ville de Ch\u00c3\u00a2tellerault,\nnow reduced to poverty, the _citoyenne_ Gamelin lived in seclusion,\nkeeping house for her son the painter. He was the elder of her two\nchildren. As for her daughter Julie, at one time employed at a\nfashionable milliner's in the Rue Honor\u00c3\u00a9, the best thing was not to know\nwhat had become of her, for it was ill saying the truth, that she had\nemigrated with an aristocrat.\n\n\"Lord God!\" sighed the _citoyenne_, showing her son a loaf baked of\nheavy dun-coloured dough, \"bread is too dear for anything; the more\nreason it should be made of pure wheat! At market neither eggs nor\ngreen-stuff nor cheese to be had. By dint of eating chestnuts, we're\nlike to grow into chestnuts.\"\n\nAfter a long pause, she began again:\n\n\"Why, I've seen women in the streets who had nothing to feed their\nlittle ones with. The distress is sore among poor folks. And it will go\non the same till things are put back on a proper footing.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" broke in Gamelin with a frown, \"the scarcity we suffer from is\ndue to the unprincipled buyers and speculators who starve the people and\nconnive with our foes over the border to render the Republic odious to\nthe citizens and to destroy liberty. This comes of the Brissotins' plots\nand the traitorous dealings of your P\u00c3\u00a9tions and Rolands. It is well if\nthe federalists in arms do not march on Paris and massacre the patriot\nremnant whom famine is too slow in killing! There is no time to lose;\nwe must tax the price of flour and guillotine every man who speculates\nin the food of the people, foments insurrection or palters with the\nforeigner. The Convention has set up an extraordinary tribunal to try\nconspirators. Patriots form the court; but will its members have energy\nenough to defend the fatherland against our foes? There is hope in\nRobespierre; he is virtuous. There is hope above all in Marat. He loves\nthe people, discerns its true interests and promotes them. He was ever\nthe first to unmask traitors, to baffle plots. He is incorruptible and\nfearless. He, and he alone, can save the imperilled Republic.\"\n\nThe _citoyenne_ Gamelin shook her head, paying no heed to the cockade\nthat fell out of her cap at the gesture.\n\n\"Have done, \u00c3\u0089variste; your Marat is a man like another and no better\nthan the rest. You are young and your head is full of fancies. What you\nsay to-day of Marat, you said before of Mirabeau, of La Fayette, of\nP\u00c3\u00a9tion, of Brissot.\"\n\n\"Never!\" cried Gamelin, who was genuinely oblivious.\n\nAfter clearing one end of the deal table of the papers and books,\nbrushes and chalks that littered it, the _citoyenne_ laid out on it the\nearthenware soup-bowl, two tin porringers, two iron forks, the loaf of\nbrown bread and a jug of thin wine.\n\nMother and son ate the soup in silence and finished their meal with a\nsmall scrap of bacon. The _citoyenne_, putting _her_ titbit on her\nbread, used the point of her pocket knife to convey the pieces one by\none slowly and solemnly to her toothless jaws and masticated with a\nproper reverence the victuals that had cost so dear.\n\nShe had left the best part on the dish for her son, who sat lost in a\nbrown study.\n\n\"Eat, \u00c3\u0089variste,\" she repeated at regular intervals, \"eat,\"--and on her\nlips the word had all the solemnity of a religious commandment.\n\nShe began again with her lamentations on the dearness of provisions, and\nagain Gamelin demanded taxation as the only remedy for these evils.\n\nBut she shrilled:\n\n\"There is no money left in the country. The _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s_ have carried it\nall off with them. There is no confidence left either. Everything is\ndesperate.\"\n\n\"Hush, mother, hush!\" protested Gamelin. \"What matter our privations,\nour hardships of a moment? The Revolution will win for all time the\nhappiness of the human race.\"\n\nThe good dame sopped her bread in her wine; her mood grew more cheerful\nand she smiled as her thoughts returned to her young days, when she used\nto dance on the green in honour of the King's birthday. She well\nremembered too the day when Joseph Gamelin, cutler by trade, had asked\nher hand in marriage. And she told over, detail by detail, how things\nhad gone,--how her mother had bidden her: \"Go dress. We are going to the\nPlace de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, to Monsieur Bienassis' shop, to see Damiens drawn and\nquartered,\" and what difficulty they had to force their way through the\npress of eager spectators. Presently, in Monsieur Bienassis' shop, she\nhad seen Joseph Gamelin, wearing his fine rose-pink coat and had known\nin an instant what he would be at. All the time she sat at the window to\nsee the regicide torn with red-hot pincers, drenched with molten lead,\ndragged at the tail of four horses and thrown into the flames, Joseph\nGamelin had stood behind her chair and had never once left off\ncomplimenting her on her complexion, her hair and her figure.\n\nShe drained the last drop in her cup and continued her reminiscences of\nother days:\n\n\"I brought you into the world, \u00c3\u0089variste, sooner than I had expected, by\nreason of a fright I had when I was big. It was on the Pont-Neuf, where\nI came near being knocked down by a crowd of sightseers hurrying to\nMonsieur de Lally's execution. You were so little at your birth the\nsurgeon thought you would not live. But I felt sure God would be\ngracious to me and preserve your life. I reared you to the best of my\npowers, grudging neither pains nor expense. It is fair to say, my\n\u00c3\u0089variste, that you showed me you were grateful and that, from childhood\nup, you tried your best to recompense me for what I had done. You were\nnaturally affectionate and tender-hearted. Your sister was not bad at\nheart; but she was selfish and of unbridled temper. Your compassion was\ngreater than ever was hers for the unfortunate. When the little\nragamuffins of the neighbourhood robbed birds' nests in the trees, you\nalways fought hard to rescue the nestlings from their hands and restore\nthem to the mother, and many a time you did not give in till after you\nhad been kicked and cuffed cruelly. At seven years of age, instead of\nwrangling with bad boys, you would pace soberly along the street saying\nover your catechism; and all the poor people you came across you\ninsisted on bringing home with you to relieve their needs, till I was\nforced to whip you to break you of the habit. You could not see a living\ncreature suffer without tears. When you had done growing, you turned out\na very handsome lad. To my great surprise, you appeared not to know\nit,--how different from most pretty boys, who are full of conceit and\nvain of their good looks!\"\n\nHis old mother spoke the truth. \u00c3\u0089variste at twenty had had a grave and\ncharming cast of countenance, a beauty at once austere and feminine, the\ncountenance of a Minerva. Now his sombre eyes and pale cheeks revealed a\nmelancholy and passionate soul. But his gaze, when it fell on his\nmother, recovered for a brief moment its childish softness.\n\nShe went on:\n\n\"You might have profited by your advantages to run after the girls, but\nyou preferred to stay with me in the shop, and I had sometimes to tell\nyou not to hang on always to my apron-strings, but to go and amuse\nyourself with your young companions. To my dying day I shall always\ntestify that you have been a good son, \u00c3\u0089variste. After your father's\ndeath, you bravely took me and provided for me; though your work barely\npays you, you have never let me want for anything, and if we are at this\nmoment destitute and miserable, I cannot blame you for it. The fault\nlies with the Revolution.\"\n\nHe raised his hand to protest; but she only shrugged and continued:\n\n\"I am no aristocrat. I have seen the great in the full tide of their\npower, and I can bear witness that they abused their privileges. I have\nseen your father cudgelled by the Duc de Canaleilles' lackeys because he\ndid not make way quick enough for their master. I could never abide _the\nAustrian_--she was too haughty and too extravagant. As for the King, I\nthought him good-hearted, and it needed his trial and condemnation to\nalter my opinion. In fact, I do not regret the old r\u00c3\u00a9gime,--though I\nhave had some agreeable times under it. But never tell me the Revolution\nis going to establish equality, because men will never be equal; it is\nan impossibility, and, let them turn the country upside down to their\nheart's content, there will still be great and small, fat and lean in\nit.\"\n\nAs she talked, she was busy putting away the plates and dishes. The\npainter had left off listening. He was thinking out a design,--for a\nsansculotte, in red cap and _carmagnole_, who was to supersede the\ndiscredited knave of spades in his pack of cards.\n\nThere was a sound of scratching on the door, and a girl appeared,--a\ncountry wench, as broad as she was long, red-haired and bandy-legged, a\nwen hiding the left eye, the right so pale a blue it looked white, with\nmonstrous thick lips and teeth protruding beyond them.\n\nShe asked Gamelin if he was Gamelin the painter and if he could do her a\nportrait of her betrothed, Ferrand (Jules), a volunteer serving with the\nArmy of the Ardennes.\n\nGamelin replied that he would be glad to execute the portrait on the\ngallant warrior's return.\n\nBut the girl insisted gently but firmly that it must be done at once.\n\nThe painter protested, smiling in spite of himself as he pointed out\nthat he could do nothing without the original.\n\nThe poor creature was dumfounded; she had not foreseen the difficulty.\nHer head drooping over the left shoulder, her hands clasped in front of\nher, she stood still and silent as if overwhelmed by her disappointment.\nTouched and diverted by so much simplicity, and by way of distracting\nthe poor, lovesick creature's grief, the painter handed her one of the\nsoldiers he had drawn in water-colours and asked her if he was like\nthat, her sweetheart in the Ardennes.\n\nShe bent her doleful look on the sketch, and little by little her eye\nbrightened, sparkled, flashed, and her moon face beamed out in a radiant\nsmile.\n\n\"It is his very likeness,\" she cried at last. \"It is the very spit of\nJules Ferrand, it is Jules Ferrand to the life.\"\n\nBefore it occurred to the artist to take the sheet of paper out of her\nhands, she folded it carefully with her coarse red fingers into a tiny\nsquare, slipped it over her heart between her stays and her shift,\nhanded the painter an _assignat_ for five livres, and wishing the\ncompany a very good day, hobbled light-heartedly to the door and so out\nof the room.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nOn the afternoon of the same day \u00c3\u0089variste set out to see the _citoyen_\nJean Blaise, printseller, as well as dealer in ornamental boxes, fancy\ngoods and games of all sorts, in the Rue Honor\u00c3\u00a9, opposite the Oratoire\nand near the office of the Messageries, at the sign of the _Amour\npeintre_. The shop was on the ground floor of a house sixty years old,\nand opened on the street by a vaulted arch the keystone of which bore a\ngrotesque head with horns. The semicircle beneath the arch was occupied\nby an oil-painting representing \"the Sicilian or Cupid the Painter,\"\nafter a composition by Boucher, which Jean Blaise's father had put up in\n1770 and which sun and rain had been doing their best to obliterate ever\nsince. On either side of the door a similar arched opening, with a\nnymph's head on the keystone arch glazed with the largest panes to be\ngot, exhibited for the benefit of the public the prints in vogue at the\ntime and the latest novelties in coloured engravings. To-day's display\nincluded a series of scenes of gallantry by Boilly, treated in his\ngraceful, rather stiff way, _Le\u00c3\u00a7ons d'amour conjugal_, _Douces\nr\u00c3\u00a9sistances_ and the like, which scandalized the Jacobins and which the\nrigid moralists denounced to the Society of Arts, Debucourt's _Promenade\npublique_, with a dandy in canary-coloured breeches lounging on three\nchairs, a group of horses by the young Carle Vernet, pictures of air\nballoons, the _Bain de Virginie_ and figures after the antique.\n\nAmid the stream of citizens that flowed past the shop it was the\nraggedest figures that loitered longest before the two fascinating\nwindows. Easily amused, delighting in pictures and bent on getting their\nshare, if only through the eyes, of the good things of this world, they\nstood in open-mouthed admiration, whereas the aristocrats merely glanced\nin, frowned and passed on.\n\nThe instant he came within sight of the house, \u00c3\u0089variste fixed his eyes\non one of the row of windows above the shop, the one on the left hand,\nwhere there was a red carnation in a flower-pot behind a balcony of\ntwisted ironwork. It was the window of \u00c3\u0089lodie's chamber, Jean Blaise's\ndaughter. The print-dealer lived with his only child on the first floor\nof the house.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste, after halting a moment as if to get his breath in front of the\n_Amour peintre_, turned the hasp of the shop-door. He found the\n_citoyenne_ \u00c3\u0089lodie within; she had just sold a couple of engravings by\nFragonard _fils_ and Naigeon, carefully selected from a number of\nothers, and before locking up the _assignats_ received in payment in the\nstrong-box, was holding them one after the other between her fine eyes\nand the light, to scrutinize the delicate lines and intricate curves of\nengraving and the watermark. She was naturally suspicious, for as much\nforged paper was in circulation as true, which was a great hindrance to\ncommerce. As in former days, in the case of such as copied the King's\nsignature, forgers of the national currency were punished by death; yet\nplates for printing _assignats_ were to be found in every cellar, the\nSwiss smuggled in counterfeits by the million, whole packets were put in\ncirculation in the inns, the English landed bales of them every day on\nour coasts, to ruin the Republic's credit and bring good patriots to\ndestitution. \u00c3\u0089lodie was in terror of accepting bad paper, and still more\nin terror of passing it and being treated as an accomplice of Pitt,\nthough she had a firm belief in her own good luck and felt pretty sure\nof coming off best in any emergency.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste looked at her with the sombre gaze that speaks more movingly of\nlove than the most smiling face. She returned his gaze with a mocking\ncurl of the lips and an arch gleam in the dark eyes,--an expression she\nwore because she knew he loved her and liked to know it and because such\na look provokes a lover, makes him complain of ill-usage, brings him to\nthe speaking point, if he has not spoken already, which was \u00c3\u0089variste's\ncase.\n\nBefore depositing the _assignats_ in the strong-box, she produced from\nher work-basket a white scarf, which she had begun to embroider, and set\nto work on it. At once industrious and a coquette, she knew\ninstinctively how to ply her needle so as to fascinate an admirer and\nmake a pretty thing for her wearing at one and the same time; she had\nquite different ways of working according to the person watching her,--a\nnonchalant way for those she would lull into a gentle languor, a\ncapricious way for those she was fain to see in a more or less\ndespairing mood. For \u00c3\u0089variste, she bent with an air of painstaking\nabsorption over her scarf, for she wanted to stir a sentiment of serious\naffection in his heart.\n\n\u00c3\u0089lodie was neither very young nor very pretty. She might have been\ndeemed plain at the first glance. She was a brunette, with an olive\ncomplexion; under the broad white kerchief knotted carelessly about her\nhead, from which the dark lustrous ringlets escaped, her eyes of fire\ngleamed as if they would burn their orbits. Her round face with its\nprominent cheek-bones, laughing lips and rather broad nose, that gave it\na wild-wood, voluptuous expression, reminded the painter of the faun of\nthe Borghese, a cast of which he had seen and been struck with\nadmiration for its freakish charm. A faint down of moustache accentuated\nthe curve of the full lips. A bosom that seemed big with love was\nconfined by a crossed kerchief in the fashion of the year. Her supple\nwaist, her active limbs, her whole vigorous body expressed in every\nmovement a wild, delicious freedom. Every glance, every breath, every\nquiver of the warm flesh called for love and promised passion. There,\nbehind the tradesman's counter, she seemed rather a dancing nymph, a\nbacchante of the opera, stripped of her lynx skin and thyrsus,\nimprisoned, and travestied by a magician's spell under the modest\ntrappings of a housewife by Chardin.\n\n\"My father is not at home,\" she told the painter; \"wait a little, he\nwill not be long.\"\n\nIn the small brown hands the needle travelled swiftly over the fine\nlawn.\n\n\"Is the pattern to your taste, Monsieur Gamelin?\"\n\nIt was not in Gamelin's nature to pretend. And love, exaggerating his\nconfidence, encouraged him to speak quite frankly.\n\n\"You embroider cleverly, _citoyenne_; but, if I am to say what I think,\nthe pattern you have traced is not simple enough or bold enough, and\nsmacks of the affected taste that in France governed too long the\nornamentation of dress and furniture and woodwork; all those rosettes\nand wreaths recall the pretty, finikin style that was in favour under\nthe tyrant. There is a new birth of taste. Alas! we have much leeway to\nmake up. In the days of the infamous Louis XV the art of decoration had\nsomething Chinese about it. They made pot-bellied cabinets with drawer\nhandles grotesque in their contortions, good for nothing but to be\nthrown on the fire to warm good patriots. Simplicity alone is beautiful.\nWe must hark back to the antique. David designs beds and chairs from the\nEtruscan vases and the wall-paintings of Herculaneum.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have seen those beds and chairs,\" said \u00c3\u0089lodie, \"they are lovely.\nSoon we shall want no other sort. I am like you, I adore the antique.\"\n\n\"Well, then, _citoyenne_,\" returned \u00c3\u0089variste, \"if you had limited your\npattern to a Greek border, with ivy leaves, serpents or crossed arrows,\nit would have been worthy of a Spartan maiden ... and of you. But you\ncan still keep this design by simplifying it, reducing it to the plain\nlines of beauty.\"\n\nShe asked her preceptor what should be picked out.\n\nHe bent over the work, and the girl's ringlets swept lightly over his\ncheek. Their hands met and their breaths mingled. For an instant\n\u00c3\u0089variste tasted an ecstatic bliss, but to feel \u00c3\u0089lodie's lips so close to\nhis own filled him with fear, and dreading to alarm her modesty, he drew\nback quickly.\n\nThe _citoyenne_ Blaise was in love with \u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin; she thought\nhis great ardent eyes superb no less than the fine oval of his pale\nface, and his abundant black locks, parted above the brow and falling\nin showers about his shoulders; his gravity of demeanour, his cold\nreserve, his severe manner and uncompromising speech which never\ncondescended to flattery, were equally to her liking. She was in love,\nand therefore believed him possessed of supreme artistic genius that\nwould one day blossom forth in incomparable masterpieces and make his\nname world-famous,--and she loved him the better for the belief. The\n_citoyenne_ Blaise was no prude on the score of masculine purity and her\nscruples were not offended because a man should satisfy his passions and\nfollow his own tastes and caprices; she loved \u00c3\u0089variste, who was\nvirtuous; she did not love him because he was virtuous, albeit she\nappreciated the advantage of his being so in that she had no cause for\njealousy or suspicion or any fear of rivals in his affections.\n\nNevertheless, for the time being, she deemed his reserve a little\noverdone. If Racine's \"Aricie,\" who loved \"Hippolyte,\" admired the\nyouthful hero's untameable virtue, it was with the hope of winning a\nvictory over it, and she would quickly have bewailed a sternness of\nmoral fibre that had refused to be softened for her sake. At the first\nopportunity she more than half declared her passion to constrain him to\nspeak out himself. Like her prototype the tender-hearted \"Aricie,\" the\n_citoyenne_ Blaise was much inclined to think that in love the woman is\nbound to make the advances. \"The fondest hearts,\" she told herself, \"are\nthe most fearful; they need help and encouragement. Besides, they are so\nsimple a woman can go half way and even further without their even\nknowing it, if only she lets them fancy the credit is theirs of the bold\nattack and the glorious victory.\" What made her more confident of\nsuccess was the fact that she knew for a certainty (and indeed there was\nno doubt about it) that \u00c3\u0089variste, before ever the Revolution had made\nhim a hero, had loved a mistress like any ordinary mortal, a very\nunheroic creature, no other than the _concierge_ at the Academy of\nPainting. \u00c3\u0089lodie, who was a girl of some experience, quite realised that\nthere are different sorts of love. The sentiment \u00c3\u0089variste inspired in\nher heart was profound enough for her to dream of making him the partner\nof her life. She was very ready to marry him, but hardly expected her\nfather would approve the union of his only daughter with a poor and\nunknown artist. Gamelin had nothing, while the printseller turned over\nlarge sums of money. The _Amour peintre_ brought him in large profits,\nthe share market larger still, and he was in partnership with an army\ncontractor who supplied the cavalry of the Republic with rushes in place\nof hay and mildewed oats. In a word, the cutler's son of the Rue\nSaint-Dominique was a very insignificant personage beside the publisher\nof engravings, a man known throughout Europe, related to the Blaizots,\nBasans and Didots, and an honoured guest at the houses of the _citoyens_\nSaint-Pierre and Florian. Not that, as an obedient daughter should, she\nheld her father's consent to be an indispensable preliminary to her\nsettlement in life. The latter, early left a widower, and a man of a\nself-indulgent, volatile temper, as enterprising with women as he was in\nbusiness, had never paid much heed to her and had left her to develop at\nher own sweet will, untrammelled whether by parental advice or parental\naffection, more careful to ignore than to safeguard the girl's\nbehaviour, whose passionate temperament he appreciated as a connoisseur\nof the sex and in whom he recognized charms far and away more seductive\nthan a pretty face. Too generous-hearted to be circumspect, too clever\nto come to harm, cautious even in her caprices, passion had never made\nher forget the social proprieties. Her father was infinitely grateful\nfor this prudent behaviour, and as she had inherited from him a good\nhead for business and a taste for money-making, he never troubled\nhimself as to the mysterious reasons that deterred a girl so eminently\nmarriageable from entering that estate and kept her at home, where she\nwas as good as a housekeeper and four clerks to him. At twenty-seven she\nfelt old enough and experienced enough to manage her own concerns and\nhad no need to ask the advice or consult the wishes of a father still a\nyoung man, and one of so easy-going and careless a temper. But for her\nto marry Gamelin, Monsieur Blaise must needs contrive a future for a\nson-in-law with such poor prospects, give him an interest in the\nbusiness, guarantee him regular work as he did to several artists\nalready--in fact, one way or another, provide him with a livelihood; and\nsuch a favour was out of the question, she considered, whether for the\none to offer or the other to accept, so small was the bond of sympathy\nbetween the two men.\n\nThe difficulty troubled the girl's tender heart and wise brain. She saw\nnothing to alarm her in a secret union with her lover and in taking the\nauthor of nature for sole witness of their mutual troth. Her creed found\nnothing blameworthy in such a union, which the independence of her mode\nof life made possible and which \u00c3\u0089variste's honourable and virtuous\ncharacter gave her good hopes of forming without apprehension as to the\nresult. But Gamelin was hard put to it to live and provide his old\nmother with the barest necessaries, and it did not seem as though in so\nstraitened an existence room could well be found for an amour even when\nreduced to the simplicity of nature. Moreover, \u00c3\u0089variste had not yet\nspoken and declared his intentions, though certainly the _citoyenne_\nBlaise hoped to bring him to this before long.\n\nShe broke off her meditations, and the needle stopped at the same\nmoment.\n\n\"_Citoyen_ \u00c3\u0089variste,\" she said, \"I shall not care for the scarf, unless\nyou like it too. Draw me a pattern, please. Meanwhile, I will copy\nPenelope and unravel what I have done in your absence.\"\n\nHe answered in a tone of sombre enthusiasm:\n\n\"I promise you I will, _citoyenne_. I will draw you the brand of the\ntyrannicide Harmodius,--a sword in a wreath,\"--and pulling out his\npencil, he sketched in a design of swords and flowers in the sober,\nunadorned style he admired. And as he drew, he expounded his views of\nart:\n\n\"A regenerated People,\" he declared, \"must repudiate all the legacies of\nservitude, bad taste, bad outline, bad drawing. Watteau, Boucher,\nFragonard worked for tyrants and for slaves. Their works show no feeling\nfor good style or purity of line, no love of nature or truth. Masks,\ndolls, fripperies, monkey-tricks,--nothing else! Posterity will despise\ntheir frivolous productions. In a hundred years all Watteau's pictures\nwill be banished to the garrets and falling to pieces from neglect; in\n1893 struggling painters will be daubing their studies over Boucher's\ncanvases. David has opened the way; he approaches the Antique, but he\nhas not yet reached true simplicity, true grandeur, bare and unadorned.\nOur artists have many secrets still to learn from the friezes of\nHerculaneum, the Roman bas-reliefs, the Etruscan vases.\"\n\nHe dilated at length on antique beauty, then came back to Fragonard,\nwhom he abused with inexhaustible venom:\n\n\"Do you know him, _citoyenne_?\"\n\n\u00c3\u0089lodie nodded.\n\n\"You likewise know good old Greuze, who is ridiculous enough, to be\nsure, with his scarlet coat and his sword. But he looks like a wise man\nof Greece beside Fragonard. I met him, a while ago, the miserable old\nman, trotting by under the arcades of the Palais-\u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9, powdered,\ngenteel, sprightly, spruce, hideous. At sight of him, I longed that,\nfailing Apollo, some sturdy friend of the arts might hang him up to a\ntree and flay him alive like Marsyas as an everlasting warning to bad\npainters.\"\n\n\u00c3\u0089lodie gave him a long look out of her dancing, wanton eyes.\n\n\"You know how to hate, Monsieur Gamelin, are we to conclude you know\nalso how to lo...?\"\n\n\"Is that you, Gamelin?\" broke in a tenor voice; it was the _citoyen_\nBlaise just come back to his shop. He advanced, boots creaking, charms\nrattling, coat-skirts flying, an enormous black cocked hat on his head,\nthe corners of which touched his shoulders.\n\n\u00c3\u0089lodie, picking up her work-basket, retreated to her chamber.\n\n\"Well, Gamelin!\" inquired the _citoyen_ Blaise, \"have you brought me\nanything new?\"\n\n\"May be,\" declared the painter,--and proceeded to expound his ideas.\n\n\"Our playing cards present a grievous and startling contrast with our\npresent ways of thinking. The names of knave and king offend the ears of\na patriot. I have designed and executed a reformed, Revolutionary pack\nin which for kings, queens, and knaves are substituted Liberties,\nEqualities, Fraternities; the aces in a border of fasces, are called\nLaws.... You call Liberty of clubs, Equality of spades, Fraternity of\ndiamonds, Law of hearts. I venture to think my cards are drawn with some\nspirit; I propose to have them engraved on copper by Desmahis, and to\ntake out letters of patent.\"\n\nSo saying and extracting from his portfolio some finished designs in\nwater-colour, the artist handed them to the printseller.\n\nThe _citoyen_ Blaise declined to take them, and turning away:\n\n\"My lad,\" he sneered, \"take 'em to the Convention; they will perhaps\naccord you a vote of thanks. But never think to make a _sol_ by your new\ninvention which is not new at all. You're a day behind the fair. Your\nRevolutionary pack of cards is the third I've had brought me. Your\ncomrade Dugourc offered me last week a picquet set with four Geniuses of\nthe People, four Liberties, four Equalities. Another was suggested, with\nSages and Heroes, Cato, Rousseau, Hannibal,--I don't know what all!...\nAnd these cards had the advantage over yours, my friend, in being\ncoarsely drawn and cut on wood blocks--with a penknife. How little you\nknow the world to dream that players will use cards designed in the\ntaste of David and engraved \u00c3\u00a0 la Bartolozzi! And then again, what a\nstrange mistake to think it needs all this to-do to suit the old packs\nto the new ideas. Out of their own heads, the good sansculottes can find\na corrective for what offends them, saying, instead of 'king'--'The\nTyrant!' or just 'The fat pig!' They go on using the same old filthy\ncards and never buy new ones. The great market for playing-cards is the\ngaming-hells of the Palais-\u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9; well, I advise you to go there and\noffer the croupiers and punters there your Liberties, your Equalities,\nyour ... what d'ye call 'em?... Laws of hearts ... and come back and\ntell me what sort of a reception they gave you!\"\n\nThe _citoyen_ Blaise sat down on the counter, filliped away sundry\ngrains of snuff from his nankeen breeches and looking at Gamelin with an\nair of gentle pity:\n\n\"Let me give you a bit of advice, _citoyen_; if you want to make your\nliving, drop your patriotic packs of cards, leave your revolutionary\nsymbols alone, have done with your Hercules, your hydras, your Furies\npursuing guilt, your Geniuses of Liberty, and paint me pretty girls. The\npeople's ardour for regeneration grows lukewarm with time, but men will\nalways love women. Paint me women, all pink and white, with little feet\nand tiny hands. And get this into your thick skull that nobody cares a\nfig about the Revolution or wants to hear another word about it.\"\n\nBut \u00c3\u0089variste drew himself up in indignant protest:\n\n\"What! not hear another word of the Revolution!... But, why surely, the\nrestoration of liberty, the victories of our armies, the chastisement of\ntyrants are events that will startle the most remote posterity. How\ncould we not be struck by such portents?... What! the sect of the\n_sansculotte_ Jesus has lasted well-nigh eighteen centuries, and the\nreligion of Liberty is to be abolished after barely four years of\nexistence!\"\n\nBut Jean Blaise resumed in a tone of superiority:\n\n\"You walk in a dream; _I_ see life as it is. Believe me, friend, the\nRevolution is a bore; it lasts over long. Five years of enthusiasm, five\nyears of fraternal embraces, of massacres, of fine speeches, of\n_Marseillaises_, of tocsins, of 'hang up the aristocrats,' of heads\npromenaded on pikes, of women mounted astride of cannon, of trees of\nLiberty crowned with the red cap, of white-robed maidens and old men\ndrawn about the streets in flower-wreathed cars; of imprisonments and\nguillotinings, of proclamations, and short commons, of cockades and\nplumes, swords and _carmagnoles_--it grows tedious! And then folk are\nbeginning to lose the hang of it all. We have gone through too much, we\nhave seen too many of the great men and noble patriots whom you have led\nin triumph to the Capitol only to hurl them afterwards from the Tarpeian\nrock,--Necker, Mirabeau, La Fayette, Bailly, P\u00c3\u00a9tion, Manuel, and how\nmany others! How can we be sure you are not preparing the same fate for\nyour new heroes?... Men have lost all count.\"\n\n\"Their names, _citoyen_ Blaise; name them, these heroes we are making\nready to sacrifice!\" cried Gamelin in a tone that recalled the\nprint-dealer to a sense of prudence.\n\n\"I am a Republican and a patriot,\" he replied, clapping his hand on his\nheart. \"I am as good a Republican as you, as ardent a patriot as you,\n_citoyen_ Gamelin. I do not suspect your zeal nor accuse you of any\nbacksliding. But remember that my zeal and my devotion to the State are\nattested by numerous acts. Here you have my principles: I give my\nconfidence to every individual competent to serve the Nation. Before the\nmen whom the general voice elects to the perilous honour of the\nLegislative office, such as Marat, such as Robespierre, I bow my head; I\nam ready to support them to the measure of my poor ability and offer\nthem the humble co-operation of a good citizen. The Committees can bear\nwitness to my ardour and self-sacrifice. In conjunction with true\npatriots, I have furnished oats and fodder to our gallant cavalry, boots\nfor our soldiers. This very day I am despatching from Vernon a convoy of\nsixty oxen to the Army of the South through a country infested with\nbrigands and patrolled by the emissaries of Pitt and Cond\u00c3\u00a9. I do not\ntalk; I act.\"\n\nGamelin calmly put back his sketches in his portfolio, the strings of\nwhich he tied and then slipped it under his arm.\n\n\"It is a strange contradiction,\" he said through his clenched teeth, \"to\nsee men help our soldiers to carry through the world the liberty they\nbetray in their own homes by sowing discontent and alarm in the soul of\nits defenders.... Greeting and farewell, _citoyen_ Blaise.\"\n\nBefore turning down the alley that runs alongside the Oratoire, Gamelin,\nhis heart big with love and anger, wheeled round for a last look at the\nred carnations blossoming on a certain window-sill.\n\nHe did not despair; the fatherland would yet be saved. Against Jean\nBlaise's unpatriotic speeches he set his faith in the Revolution. Still\nhe was bound to recognize that the tradesman had some show of reason\nwhen he asserted that the people of Paris had lost its old interest in\npublic events. Alas! it was but too manifest that to the enthusiasm of\nthe early days had little by little succeeded a widespread indifference,\nthat never again would be seen the mighty crowds, unanimous in their\nardour, of '89, never again the millions, one in heart and soul, that in\n'90 thronged round the altar of the _f\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9s_. Well, good citizens must\nshow double zeal and courage, must rouse the people from its apathy,\nbidding it choose between liberty and death.\n\nSuch were Gamelin's thoughts, and the memory of \u00c3\u0089lodie was a spur to his\nconfidence.\n\nComing to the Quais, he saw the sun setting in the distant west behind\nlowering clouds that were like mountains of glowing lava; the roofs of\nthe city were bathed in a golden light; the windows flashed back a\nthousand dazzling reflections. And Gamelin pictured the Titans forging\nout of the molten fragments of by-gone worlds Dik\u00c3\u00a9, the city of brass.\n\nNot having a morsel of bread for his mother or himself, he was dreaming\nof a place at the limitless board that should have all the world for\nguests and welcome regenerated humanity to the feast. Meantime, he tried\nto persuade himself that the fatherland, as a good mother should, would\nfeed her faithful child. Shutting his mind against the gibes of the\nprintseller, he forced himself to believe that his notion of a\nRevolutionary pack of cards was a novel one and a good one, and that\nwith these happily conceived sketches of his he held a fortune in the\nportfolio under his arm. \"Desmahis,\" he told himself, \"shall engrave\nthem. We will publish for ourselves the new patriotic toy and we are\nsure to sell ten thousand packs in a month, at twenty _sols_ apiece.\"\n\nIn his impatience to realize the project, he strode off at once for the\nQuai de la Ferraille, where Desmahis lived over a glazier's shop.\n\nThe entrance was through the shop. The glazier's wife informed Gamelin\nthat the _citoyen_ Desmahis was not in, a fact that in no wise surprised\nthe painter, who knew his friend was of a vagabond and dissipated humour\nand who marvelled that a man could engrave so much and so well as he did\nwhile showing so little perseverance. Gamelin made up his mind to wait a\nwhile for his return and the woman offered him a chair. She was in a\nblack mood and began to grumble at the badness of trade, though she had\nalways been told that the Revolution, by breaking windows, was making\nthe glaziers' fortunes.\n\nNight was falling; so abandoning his idea of waiting for his comrade,\nGamelin took his leave of his hostess of the moment. As he was crossing\nthe Pont-Neuf, he saw a detachment of National Guards debouch from the\nQuai des Morfondus. They were mounted and carried torches. They were\ndriving back the crowd, and amid a mighty clatter of sabres escorting a\ncart driving slowly on its way to the guillotine with a man whose name\nno one knew, a _ci-devant_ noble, the first prisoner condemned by the\nnewly constituted Revolutionary Tribunal. He could be seen by glimpses\nbetween the guardsmen's hats, sitting with hands tied behind his back,\nhis head bared and swaying from side to side, his face to the cart's\ntail. The headsman stood beside him lolling against the rail. The\npassers-by had stopped to look and were telling each other it was likely\none of the fellows who starved the people, and staring with eyes of\nindifference. Gamelin, coming closer, caught sight of Desmahis among the\nspectators; he was struggling to push a way through the press and cut\nacross the line of march. He called out to him and clapped a hand on his\nshoulder,--and Desmahis turned his head. He was a young man with a\nhandsome face and a stalwart person. In former days, at the Academy,\nthey used to say he had the head of Bacchus on the torso of Hercules.\nHis friends nicknamed him \"Barbaroux\" because of his likeness to that\nrepresentative of the people.\n\n\"Come here,\" Gamelin said to him, \"I have something of importance to say\nto you, Desmahis.\"\n\n\"Leave me alone,\" the latter answered peevishly, muttering some\nhalf-heard explanation, looking out as he spoke for a chance of darting\nacross:\n\n\"I was following a divine creature, in a straw hat, a milliner's wench,\nwith her flaxen hair down her back; that cursed cart has blocked my\nway.... She has gone on ahead, she is at the other end of the bridge by\nnow!\"\n\nGamelin endeavoured to hold him back by his coat skirts, swearing his\nbusiness was urgent.\n\nBut Desmahis had already slipped away between horses, guards, swords and\ntorches, and was in hot pursuit of the milliner's girl.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nIt was ten o'clock in the forenoon. The April sun bathed the tender\nleafage of the trees in light. A storm had cleared the air during the\nnight and it was deliciously fresh and sweet. At long intervals a\nhorseman passing along the All\u00c3\u00a9e des Veuves broke the silence and\nsolitude. On the outskirts of the shady avenue, over against a rustic\ncottage known as _La Belle Lilloise_, \u00c3\u0089variste sat on a wooden bench\nwaiting for \u00c3\u0089lodie. Since the day their fingers had met over the\nembroidery and their breaths had mingled, he had never been back to the\n_Amour peintre_. For a whole week his proud stoicism and his timidity,\nwhich grew more extreme every day, had kept him away from \u00c3\u0089lodie. He had\nwritten her a letter conceived in a key of gravity, at once sombre and\nardent, in which, explaining the grievance he had against the _citoyen_\nBlaise, but saying no word of his love and concealing his chagrin, he\nannounced his intention of never returning to her father's shop, and was\nnow showing greater steadfastness in keeping this resolution than a\nwoman in love was quite likely to approve.\n\nA born fighter whose bent was to defend her property under all\ncircumstances, \u00c3\u0089lodie instantly turned her mind to the task of winning\nback her lover. At first she thought of going to see him at the studio\nin the Place de Thionville. But knowing his touchy temper and judging\nfrom his letter that he was sick and sore, she feared he might come to\nregard daughter and father with the same angry displeasure and make a\npoint of never seeing her again; so she deemed it wiser to invite him to\na sentimental, romantic rendezvous which he could not well decline,\nwhere she would have ample time to cajole and charm him and where\nsolitude would be her ally to fascinate his senses and overcome his\nscruples.\n\nAt this period, in all the English gardens and all the fashionable\npromenades, rustic cottages were to be found, built by clever\narchitects, whose aim it was to flatter the taste of the city folk for a\ncountry life. The _Belle Lilloise_ was occupied as a house of light\nrefreshment; its exterior bore a look of poverty that was part of the\n_mise en sc\u00c3\u00a8ne_ and it stood on the fragments, artistically imitated, of\na fallen tower, so as to unite with the charm of rusticity the\nmelancholy appeal of a ruined castle. Moreover, as though a peasant's\ncot and a shattered donjon were not enough to stir the sensibilities of\nhis customers, the owner had raised a tomb beneath a weeping-willow,--a\ncolumn surmounted by a funeral urn and bearing the inscription:\n\"Cl\u00c3\u00a9onice to her faithful Azor.\" Rustic cots, ruined keeps, imitation\ntombs,--on the eve of being swept away, the aristocracy had erected in\nits ancestral parks these symbols of poverty, of decadence and of death.\nAnd now the patriot citizen found his delight in drinking, dancing,\nmaking love in sham hovels, under the broken vaults, a sham in their\nvery ruin, of sham cloisters and surrounded by a sham graveyard; for was\nnot he too, like his betters, a lover of nature, a disciple of\nJean-Jacques? was not his heart stuffed as full as theirs with\nsensibility and the philosophy of humanity?\n\nReaching the rendezvous before the appointed time, \u00c3\u0089variste waited,\nmeasuring the minutes by the beating of his heart as by the pendulum of\na clock. A patrol passed, guarding a convoy of prisoners. Ten minutes\nafter a woman dressed all in pink, carrying a bouquet as the fashion\nwas, escorted by a gentleman in a three-cornered hat, red coat, striped\nwaistcoat and breeches, slipped into the cottage, both so very like the\ngallants and dames of the ancien r\u00c3\u00a9gime one was bound to think with the\n_citoyen_ Blaise that mankind possesses characteristics Revolutions\ncannot change.\n\nA few minutes later, coming from Rueil or Saint-Cloud, an old woman\ncarrying a cylindrical box, painted in brilliant colours, arrived and\nsat down beside Gamelin, on his bench. She put down her box in front of\nher, and he saw that the lid had a turning needle fixed on it; the poor\nwoman's trade was to hold a lottery in the public gardens for the\nchildren to try their luck at. She also dealt in \"ladies' pleasures,\" an\nold-fashioned sweetmeat which she sold under a new name; whether because\nthe time-honoured title of \"forget-me-nots\" called up inappropriate\nideas of unhappiness and retribution or that folks had just got tired of\nit in course of time, \"forget-me-nots\" were now yclept \"ladies'\npleasures.\"\n\nThe old dame wiped the sweat from her forehead with a corner of her\napron and broke out into railings against heaven, upbraiding God for\ninjustice when he made life so hard for his creatures. Her husband kept\na tavern on the river-bank at Saint-Cloud, while she came in every day\nto the Champs \u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es, sounding her rattle and crying: \"_Ladies'\npleasures_, come buy, come buy!\" And with all this toil the old couple\ncould not scrape enough together to end their days in comfort.\n\nSeeing the young man beside her disposed to commiserate with her, she\nexpounded at great length the origin of her misfortunes. It was all the\nRepublic; by robbing the rich, it was taking the bread out of poor\npeople's mouths. And there was no hoping for a better state of affairs.\nThings would only go from bad to worse,--she knew that from many tokens.\nAt Nanterre a woman had had a baby born with a serpent's head; the\nlightning had struck the church at Rueil and melted the cross on the\nsteeple; a were-wolf had been seen in the woods of Chaville. Masked men\nwere poisoning the springs and throwing plague powders in the air to\ncause diseases....\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste saw \u00c3\u0089lodie spring from a carriage and run forward. The girl's\neyes flashed in the clear shadow cast by her straw hat; her lips, as red\nas the carnations she held in her hand, were wreathed in smiles. A scarf\nof black silk, crossed over the bosom, was knotted behind the back. Her\nyellow gown displayed the quick movements of the knees and showed a pair\nof low-heeled shoes below the hem. The hips were almost entirely\nunconfined; the Revolution had enfranchised the waists of its\n_citoyennes_. For all that, the skirts, still puffed out below the\nloins, marked the curves by exaggerating them and veiled the reality\nbeneath an artificial amplitude of outline.\n\nHe tried to speak but could not find his voice, and was chagrined at his\nfailure, which \u00c3\u0089lodie preferred to the most eloquent greeting. She\nnoticed also and looked upon it as a good omen, that he had tied his\ncravat with more than usual pains.\n\nShe gave him her hand.\n\n\"I wanted to see you,\" she began, \"and talk to you. I did not answer\nyour letter; I did not like it and I did not think it worthy of you. It\nwould have been more to my taste if it had been more outspoken. It would\nbe to malign your character and common sense to suppose you do not mean\nto return to the _Amour peintre_ because you had a trifling altercation\nthere about politics with a man many years your senior. Rest assured you\nhave no cause to fear my father will receive you ill whenever you come\nto see us again. You do not know him; he has forgotten both what he said\nto you and what you said in reply. I do not say there is any great bond\nof sympathy between you two; but he bears no malice; I tell you frankly\nhe pays no great heed to you ... nor to me. He thinks only of his own\naffairs and his own pleasures.\"\n\nShe stepped towards the shrubberies surrounding the _Belle Lilloise_,\nand he followed her with something of repugnance, knowing it to be the\ntrysting-place of mercenary lovers and amours of a day. She selected the\ntable furthest out of sight.\n\n\"How many things I have to tell you, \u00c3\u0089variste. Friendship has its\nrights; you do not forbid me to exercise them? I have much to say about\nyou ... and something about myself, if you will let me.\"\n\nThe landlord having brought a carafe of lemonade, she filled their\nglasses herself with the air of a careful housewife; then she began to\ntell him about her childhood, described her mother's beauty, which she\nloved to dilate upon both as a tribute to the latter's memory and as\nthe source of her own good looks, and boasted of her grandparents'\nsturdy vigour, for she was proud of her bourgeois blood. She related how\nat sixteen she had lost this mother she adored and had entered on a life\nwithout anyone to love or rely upon. She painted herself as she was, a\nvehement, passionate nature, full of sensibility and courage, and\nconcluded:\n\n\"Oh, \u00c3\u0089variste, my girlhood was so sad and lonely I cannot but know what\na prize is a heart like yours, and I will not surrender, I give you fair\nwarning, of my own free will and without an effort to retain it, a\nsympathy on which I trusted I might count and which I held dear.\"\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste gazed at her tenderly.\n\n\"Can it be, \u00c3\u0089lodie, that I am not indifferent to you? Can I really\nthink...?\"\n\nHe broke off, fearing to say too much and thereby betray so trusting a\nfriendliness.\n\nShe gave him a little confiding hand that half-peeped out of the long\nnarrow sleeve with its lace frillings. Her bosom rose and fell in\nlong-drawn sighs.\n\n\"Credit me, \u00c3\u0089variste, with all the sentiments you would have me feel for\nyou, and you will not be mistaken in the dispositions of my heart.\"\n\n\"\u00c3\u0089lodie, \u00c3\u0089lodie, you say that? will you still say it when you know\n...\"--he hesitated.\n\nShe dropped her eyes; and he finished the sentence in a whisper:\n\n\"... when you know I love you?\"\n\nAs she heard the declaration, she blushed,--with pleasure. Yet, while\nher eyes still spoke of a tender ecstasy, a quizzical smile flickered in\nspite of herself about one corner of her lips. She was thinking:\n\n\"And he imagines he proposed first!... and he is afraid perhaps of\noffending me!...\"\n\nThen she said to him fondly:\n\n\"So you had never seen, dear heart, that I loved you?\"\n\nThey seemed to themselves to be alone, the only two beings in the\nuniverse. In his exaltation, \u00c3\u0089variste raised his eyes to the firmament\nflashing with blue and gold:\n\n\"See, the sky is looking down at us! It is benign; it is adorable, as\nyou are, beloved; it has your brightness, your gentleness, your smile.\"\n\nHe felt himself one with all nature, it formed part and parcel of his\njoy and triumph. To his eyes, it was to celebrate his betrothal that the\nchestnut blossoms lit their flaming candles, the poplars burned aloft\nlike giant torches.\n\nHe exulted in his strength and stature. She, with her softer as well as\nfiner nature, more pliable and more malleable, rejoiced in her very\nweakness and, his subjection once secured, instantly bowed to his\nascendancy; now she had brought him under her slavery, she acknowledged\nhim for the master, the hero, the god, burned to obey, to admire, to\noffer her homage. In the shade of the shrubbery he gave her a long,\nardent kiss, which she received with head thrown back and, clasped in\n\u00c3\u0089variste's arms, felt all her flesh melt like wax.\n\nThey went on talking a long time of themselves, forgetful of the\nuniverse. \u00c3\u0089variste abounded mainly in vague, high thoughts, which filled\n\u00c3\u0089lodie with ecstasy. She spoke sweetly of things of practical utility\nand personal interest. Then, presently, when she felt she could stay no\nlonger, she rose with a decided air, gave her lover the three red\ncarnations from the flower in her balcony and sprang lightly into the\ncabriolet in which she had driven there. It was a hired carriage,\npainted yellow, hung on very high wheels and certainly had nothing out\nof the common about it, or the coachman either. But Gamelin was not in\nthe habit of hiring carriages and his friends were hardly more used to\nsuch an indulgence. To see the great wheels whirling her away gave him a\nstrange pang and a painful presentiment assailed him; by a sort of\nhallucination of the mind, the hack horse seemed to be carrying \u00c3\u0089lodie\naway from him beyond the bounds of the actual world and present time\ntowards a city of wealth and pleasure, towards abodes of luxury and\nenjoyment, which he would never be able to enter.\n\nThe carriage disappeared. \u00c3\u0089variste recovered his calm by degrees; but a\ndull anguish remained and he felt that the hours of tender abandonment\nhe had just lived would never be his again.\n\nHe returned by the Champs \u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es, where women in light summer dresses\nwere sitting on wooden chairs, talking or sewing, while their children\nplayed under the trees. A woman selling \"ladies' pleasures,\"--_her_ box\nwas shaped like a drum--reminded him of the one he had spoken to in the\nAll\u00c3\u00a9e des Veuves, and it seemed as if a whole epoch of his life had\nelapsed between the two encounters. He crossed the Place de la\nR\u00c3\u00a9volution. In the Tuileries gardens he caught the distant roar of a\nhost of men, a sound of many voices shouting in accord, so familiar in\nthose great days of popular enthusiasm which the enemies of the\nRevolution declared would never dawn again. He quickened his pace as the\nnoise grew louder and louder, reached the Rue Honor\u00c3\u00a9 and found it\nthronged with a crowd of men and women yelling: \"Vive la R\u00c3\u00a9publique!\nVive la Libert\u00c3\u00a9!\" The walls of the gardens, the windows, the balconies,\nthe very roofs were black with lookers-on waving hats and handkerchiefs.\nPreceded by a sapper, who cleared a way for the procession, surrounded\nby Municipal Officers, National Guards, gunners, gendarmes, huzzars,\nadvanced slowly, high above the backs of the citizens, a man of a\nbilious complexion, a wreath of oak-leaves about his brow, his body\nwrapped in an old green surtout with an ermine collar. The women threw\nhim flowers, while he cast about him the piercing glance of his\njaundiced eyes, as though, in this enthusiastic multitude he was still\nsearching out enemies of the people to denounce, traitors to punish. As\nhe went by, Gamelin bent his head and joining his voice to a hundred\nthousand others, shouted his:\n\n\"Vive Marat!\"\n\nThe triumphant hero entered the Hall of the Convention like Fate\npersonified. While the crowd slowly dispersed Gamelin sat on a stone\npost in the Rue Honor\u00c3\u00a9 and pressed his hand over his heart to check its\nwild beating. What he had seen filled him with high emotion and burning\nenthusiasm.\n\nHe loved and worshipped Marat, who, sick and fevered, his veins on fire,\neaten up by ulcers, was wearing out the last remnants of his strength in\nthe service of the Republic, and in his own poor house, closed to no\nman, welcomed him with open arms, conversed eagerly with him of public\naffairs, questioned him sometimes on the machinations of evil-doers. He\nrejoiced that the enemies of _the Just_, conspiring for his ruin, had\nprepared his triumph; he blessed the Revolutionary Tribunal, which\nacquitting the Friend of the People had given back to the Convention\nthe most zealous and most immaculate of its legislators. Again his eyes\ncould see the head racked with fever, garlanded with the civic crown,\nthe features instinct with virtuous pride and pitiless love, the worn,\nravaged, powerful face, the close-pressed lips, the broad chest, the\nstrong man dying by inches who, raised aloft in the living chariot of\nhis triumph, seemed to exhort his fellow-citizens: \"Be ye like\nme,--patriots to the death!\"\n\nThe street was empty, darkening with the shadows of approaching night;\nthe lamplighter went by with his cresset, and Gamelin muttered to\nhimself:\n\n\"Yes, to the death!\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nBy nine in the morning \u00c3\u0089variste reached the gardens of the Luxembourg,\nto find \u00c3\u0089lodie already there seated on a bench waiting for him.\n\nIt was a month ago they had exchanged their vows and since then they had\nseen each other every day, either at the _Amour peintre_ or at the\nstudio in the Place de Thionville. Their meetings had been very tender,\nbut at the same time characterized by a certain reserve that checked\ntheir expansiveness,--a reserve due to the staid and virtuous temper of\nthe lover, a theist and a good citizen, who, while ready to make his\nbeloved mistress his own before the law or with God alone for witness\naccording as circumstances demanded, would do nothing save publicly and\nin the light of day. \u00c3\u0089lodie knew the resolution to be right and\nhonourable; but, despairing of a marriage that seemed impossible from\nevery point of view and loath to outrage the prejudices of society, she\ncontemplated in her inmost heart a liaison that could be kept a secret\ntill the lapse of time gave it sanction. She hoped one day to overcome\nthe scruples of a lover she could have wished less scrupulous, and\nmeantime, unwilling to postpone some necessary confidences as to the\npast, she had asked him to meet her for a lover's talk in a lonely\ncorner of the gardens near the Carthusian Priory.\n\nShe threw him a tender look, took his hand frankly, invited him to share\nthe bench and speaking slowly and thoughtfully:\n\n\"I esteem you too well, \u00c3\u0089variste, to hide anything from you. I believe\nmyself worthy of you; I should not be so were I not to tell you\neverything. Hear me and be my judge. I have no act to reproach myself\nwith that is degrading or base, or even merely selfish. I have only been\nweak and credulous.... Do not forget, dear \u00c3\u0089variste, the difficult\ncircumstances in which I found myself. You know how it was with me; I\nhad lost my mother, my father, still a young man, thought only of his\nown amusement and neglected me. I had a feeling heart, nature has\ndowered me with a loving temper and a generous soul; it was true she had\nnot denied me a firm will and a sound judgment, but in those days what\nruled my conduct was passion, not reason. Alas! it would be the same\nagain to-day, if the two were not in harmony; I should be driven to give\nmyself to you, beloved, heart and soul, and for ever!\"\n\nShe expressed herself in firm, well-balanced phrases. She had well\nthought over what she would say, having long ago made up her mind to\nthis confession for several reasons--because she was naturally candid,\nbecause she found pleasure in following Rousseau's example, and because,\nas she told herself reasonably enough:\n\n\"One day \u00c3\u0089variste must fathom a secret which is known to others as well\nas myself. A frank avowal is best. It is unforced and therefore to my\ncredit, and only tells him what some time or other he would discover to\nmy shame.\"\n\nSoft-hearted as she was and amenable to nature's promptings, she did\nnot feel herself to be very much to blame, and this made her confession\nthe easier; besides which, she had no intention of telling more than was\nabsolutely requisite.\n\n\"Ah!\" she sighed, \"why did I not know you, \u00c3\u0089variste, in the days when I\nwas alone and forsaken?\"\n\nGamelin had taken her request quite literally when \u00c3\u0089lodie asked him to\nbe her judge. Primed at once by nature and the education of books for\nthe exercise of domestic justice, he sat ready to receive \u00c3\u0089lodie's\nadmissions.\n\nAs she still hesitated, he motioned to her to proceed. Then she began\nspeaking very simply:\n\n\"A young man, who with many defects of character combined some good\nqualities, and only showed the latter, found me to his taste and courted\nme with a perseverance that was surprising in such a case; he was in the\nflower of his youth, full of charm and the idol of a bevy of charming\nwomen who made no attempt to hide their adoration. It was not his good\nlooks nor even his brilliance that appealed to me.... He touched my\nheart by the tokens of true love he gave me, and I do think he loved me\ntruly. He was tender, impassioned. I asked no pledge save of his heart,\nand alas! his heart was fickle.... I blame no one but myself; it is my\nconfession I am making, not his. I lay nothing to his charge, for indeed\nhe is become a stranger to me. Ah! believe me, \u00c3\u0089variste, I swear it, he\nis no more to me than if he had never existed.\"\n\nShe had finished, but Gamelin vouchsafed no answer. He folded his arms,\na steadfast, sombre look settling in his eyes. His mistress and his\nsister Julie were running together in his thoughts. Julie too had\nhearkened to a lover; but, unlike, altogether unlike, he thought, the\nunhappy \u00c3\u0089lodie, _she_ had let him have his will and carry her off, not\nmisled by the promptings of a tender heart, but to enjoy, far from her\nhome and friends, the sweets of luxury and pleasure. He was a stern\nmoralist; he had condemned his sister and he was half inclined to\ncondemn his mistress.\n\n\u00c3\u0089lodie resumed in a very pleading voice:\n\n\"I was full of Jean-Jacques' philosophy; I believed men were naturally\nhonest and honourable. My misfortune was to have encountered a lover who\nwas not formed in the school of nature and natural morality, and whom\nsocial prejudice, ambition, self-love, a false point of honour had made\nselfish and treacherous.\"\n\nThe words produced the effect she had calculated on. Gamelin's eyes\nsoftened. He asked:\n\n\"Who was your seducer? Is he a man I know?\"\n\n\"You do not know him.\"\n\n\"Tell me his name.\"\n\nShe had foreseen the question and was firmly resolved not to answer it.\n\nShe gave her reasons:\n\n\"Spare me, I beseech you. For your peace of mind as for my own, I have\nalready said too much.\"\n\nThen, as he still pressed her:\n\n\"In the sacred name of our love, I refuse to tell you anything to give\nyou a definite notion of this stranger. I will not give your jealousy a\nshape to feed on; I will not bring a harassing shadow between you and\nme. I have not forgotten the man's name, but I will never let you know\nit.\"\n\nGamelin insisted on knowing the name of the seducer,--that was the word\nhe employed all through, for he felt no doubt \u00c3\u0089lodie had been seduced,\ncajoled, trifled with. He could not so much as conceive any other\npossibility,--that she had obeyed an overmastering desire, an\nirresistible craving, listened to the tempter's voice in the shape of\nher own flesh and blood; he could not find it credible that the fair\nvictim, a creature of hot passion and a fond heart, had offered herself\na willing sacrifice; to satisfy his ideal, she must needs have been\noverborne by force or fraud, constrained by sheer violence, caught in\nsnares spread about her steps on every side. He questioned her in\nguarded terms, but with a close, searching, embarrassing persistency. He\nasked her how the liaison began, if it was long or short, tranquil or\ntroubled, under what circumstances it was broken off. And his enquiries\ncame back again and again to the means the fellow had used to cajole\nher, as if these must surely have been extraordinary and unheard of. But\nall his cross-examination was in vain. She kept her own counsel with a\ngentle, deprecatory obstinacy, her lips tightly pressed together and\ntears welling in her eyes.\n\nPresently, however, \u00c3\u0089variste having asked where the man was now, she\ntold him:\n\n\"He has left the Kingdom--France, I mean,\" she corrected herself in an\ninstant.\n\n\"An _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_!\" ejaculated Gamelin.\n\nShe looked at him, speechless, at once reassured and disheartened to see\nhim create in his own mind a truth in accordance with his political\npassions and of his own motion give his jealousy a Jacobin complexion.\n\nIn actual fact \u00c3\u0089lodie's lover was a little lawyer's clerk, a very pretty\nlad, half Adonis, half guttersnipe, whom she had adored and the thought\nof whom, though three years had gone by since, still thrilled her\nnerves. Rich old women were his particular game, and he deserted \u00c3\u0089lodie\nfor a woman of the world of a certain age who could and did recompense\nhis merits. Having, after the abolition of offices, attained a post in\nthe Mairie of Paris, he was now a _sansculotte_ dragoon and the\nhanger-on of a _ci-devant_ Countess.\n\n\"A noble! an _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_!\" muttered Gamelin, whom she took good care not to\nundeceive, never having been desirous he should know the whole truth.\n\"And he deserted you like a dastard?\"\n\nShe nodded in answer. He clasped her to his heart:\n\n\"Dear victim of the vile corruption of monarchies, my love shall avenge\nhis villainy! Heaven grant, I may meet the scoundrel! I shall not fail\nto know him!\"\n\nShe turned away, at one and the same time saddened and smiling,--and\ndisappointed. She would fain have had him wiser in the lore of love,\nwith more of the natural man about him, more perhaps even of the brute.\nShe felt he forgave so readily only because his imagination was cold and\nthe secret she had revealed awoke in him none of the mental pictures\nthat torture sensuous natures,--in a word, that he saw her seduction\nsolely under a moral and social aspect.\n\nThey had risen, and while they walked up and down the shady avenues of\nthe gardens, he informed her that he only esteemed her the more because\nshe had suffered wrong, \u00c3\u0089lodie entertained no such high claims; however,\ntake him as he was, she loved him, and admired the brilliant artistic\ngenius she divined in him.\n\nAs they left the Luxembourg, they came upon crowds thronging the Rue de\nl'\u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9 and the whole neighbourhood of the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre de la Nation. There\nwas nothing to surprise them in this; for several days great excitement\nhad prevailed in the most patriotic Sections; denunciations were rife\nagainst the Orleans faction and the Brissotin plotters, who were\nconspiring, it was said, to bring about the ruin of Paris and the\nmassacre of good Republicans. Gamelin himself a short time back had\nsigned a petition from the Commune demanding the expulsion of the\nTwenty-one.\n\nJust before passing under the arcade, joining the theatre to the\nneighbouring house, they had to find their way through a group of\ncitizens _en carmagnole_ who were listening to a harangue from a young\nsoldier mounted on the top of the gallery. He looked as beautiful as the\nEros of Praxiteles in his helmet of panther-skin. This fascinating\nwarrior was charging the People's Friend with indolence:\n\n\"Marat, you are asleep,\" he was crying, \"and the federalists are forging\nfetters to bind us.\"\n\nHardly had \u00c3\u0089lodie cast eyes on the orator before she turned rapidly to\n\u00c3\u0089variste and begged him to get her away. The crowd, she declared,\nfrightened her and she was afraid of fainting in the crush.\n\nThey parted in the Place de la Nation, swearing an oath of eternal\nfidelity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat same morning early the _citoyen_ Brotteaux had made the _citoyenne_\nGamelin the magnificent present of a capon. It would have been an act of\nindiscretion for him to mention how he had come by it; as a fact, he had\nit of a _Dame de la Halle_ at the Pointe Eustache for whom he sometimes\nacted as amanuensis, and as everybody knows, these \"Ladies of the\nMarket\" cherished Royalist sympathies and were in correspondence with\nthe _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s_. The _citoyenne_ Gamelin had received the gift with\nheartfelt gratitude. Such dainties were scarce ever seen then; victuals\ngrew dearer every day. The people feared a famine; the aristocrats, they\nsaid, wished it, and the \"corner\" makers were at work to bring it about.\n\nThe _citoyen_ Brotteaux, being invited to eat his share of the capon at\nthe midday dinner, appeared in due course and congratulated his hostess\non the rich aroma of cooking that assailed his nostrils. Indeed a noble\nsmell of rich, savoury broth filled the painter's studio.\n\n\"You are very obliging, sir,\" replied the good dame. \"To prepare the\ndigestion for your capon, I have made a vegetable soup with a slice of\nfat bacon and a big beef bone. There's nothing like a marrowbone, sir,\nto give soup a flavour.\"\n\n\"The maxim does you honour, _citoyenne_,\" returned the old man. \"And you\nwill be doing wisely to put back again to-morrow and the day after, all\nthe week, in fact, to put back again, I say, this precious bone in the\npot, which it will continue to flavour. The wise woman of Panzoust\nalways did so; she used to make a soup of green cabbages with a rind of\nrusty bacon and an old _savorados_. That is what in her country, which\nis also mine, they call the medullary bone, the most tasty and most\nsucculent of all bones.\"\n\n\"This lady you speak of, sir,\" remarked the _citoyenne_ Gamelin, \"was\nshe not rather a saving soul, to make the same bone serve so many times\nover?\"\n\n\"Oh! she lived in a small way,\" explained Brotteaux, \"she was poor,\nalbeit a prophetess.\"\n\nAt that moment, \u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin returned, agitated by the confession he\nhad heard and determined to know who was \u00c3\u0089lodie's betrayer, to avenge at\none and the same time the Republic's wrong and his own on the miscreant.\n\nAfter the usual greetings had been exchanged, the _citoyen_ Brotteaux\nresumed the thread of his discourse:\n\n\"It is seldom those who make a trade of foretelling the future grow\nrich. Their impostures are too soon found out and their trickery renders\nthem odious. But indeed we should be bound to detest them much worse if\nthey prophesied truly. A man's life would be intolerable if he knew what\nis to befall him. He would be aware of calamities to come and suffer\ntheir pains in advance, while he would get no joy of present blessings\nwhose end he would foresee. Ignorance is a necessary condition of human\nhappiness, and it must be owned that in most cases we fulfil it well. We\nknow almost nothing about ourselves; absolutely nothing about our\nneighbours. Ignorance constitutes our peace of mind; self-deception our\nfelicity.\"\n\nThe _citoyenne_ Gamelin set the soup on the table, said the Benedicite\nand seated her son and her guest at the board. She stood up herself to\neat, declining the chair the _citoyen_ Brotteaux offered her beside him;\nshe said she knew what good manners required of a woman.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nTen o'clock in the forenoon. Not a breath of wind. It was the hottest\nJuly ever known. In the narrow Rue de J\u00c3\u00a9rusalem a hundred or so citizens\nof the Section were waiting in queue at the baker's door, under the eye\nof four National Guards who stood at ease smoking their pipes.\n\nThe National Convention had decreed the _maximum_,--and instantly corn\nand flour had disappeared. Like the Israelites in the wilderness, the\nParisians had to rise before daybreak if they wished to eat. The crowd\nwas lined up, men, women and children tightly packed together, under a\nsky of molten lead. The heat beat down on the rotting foulness of the\nkennels and exaggerated the stench of unwashed, sweating humanity. All\nwere pushing, abusing their neighbours, exchanging looks fraught with\nevery sort of emotion one human being can feel for another,--dislike,\ndisgust, interest, attraction, indifference. Painful experience had\ntaught them there was not bread enough for everybody; so the late comers\nwere always trying to push forward, while those who lost ground\ncomplained bitterly and indignantly and vainly claimed their rights.\nWomen shoved and elbowed savagely to keep their place or squeeze into a\nbetter. When the press grew too intolerable, cries rose of \"Stop pushing\nthere!\" while each and all protested they could not help it--it was\nsomeone else pushing them.\n\nTo obviate these daily scenes of disorder, the officials appointed by\nthe Section had conceived the notion of fastening a rope to the\nshop-door which each applicant held in his proper order; but hands at\nsuch close quarters _would_ come in contact on the rope and a struggle\nwould result. Whoever lost hold could never recover it, while the\ndisappointed and the mischievously inclined sometimes cut the cord. In\nthe end the plan had to be abandoned.\n\nOn this occasion there was the usual suffocation and confusion. While\nsome swore they were dying, others indulged in jokes or loose remarks;\nall abused the aristocrats and federalists, authors of all the misery.\nWhen a dog ran by, wags hailed the beast as Pitt. More than once a loud\nslap showed that some _citoyenne_ in the line had resented with a\nvigorous hand the insolence of a lewd admirer, while, pressed close\nagainst her neighbour, a young servant girl, with eyes half shut and\nmouth half open, stood sighing in a sort of trance. At any word, or\ngesture, or attitude of a sort to provoke the sportive humour of the\ncoarse-minded populace, a knot of young libertines would strike up the\n_\u00c3\u0087a-ira_ in chorus, regardless of the protests of an old Jacobin, highly\nindignant to see a dirty meaning attached to a refrain expressive of the\nRepublican faith in a future of justice and happiness.\n\nHis ladder under his arm, a billsticker appeared to post up on a blank\nwall facing the baker's a proclamation by the Commune apportioning the\nrations of butcher's-meat. Passers-by halted to read the notice, still\nsticky with paste. A cabbage vendor going by, basket on back, began\ncalling out in her loud cracked voice:\n\n\"They'm all gone, the purty oxen! best rake up the guts!\"\n\nSuddenly such an appalling stench of putrefaction rose from a sewer near\nby that several people were turned sick; a woman was taken ill and\nhanded over in a fainting condition to a couple of National Guards, who\ncarried her off to a pump a few yards away. All held their noses, and\nfell to growling and grumbling, exchanging conjectures each more ghastly\nand alarming than the last. What was it? a dead animal buried\nthereabouts, a dead fish, perhaps, put in for mischief's sake, or more\nlikely a victim of the September massacres, some noble or priest, left\nto rot in a cellar.\n\n\"They buried them in cellars, eh?\"\n\n\"They got rid of 'em anywhere and anyhow.\"\n\n\"It will be one of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet prisoners. On the 2nd I saw three\nhundred in a heap on the Port au Change.\"\n\nThe Parisians dreaded the vengeance of these aristocrats who were like\nto poison them with their dead bodies.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin joined the line; he was resolved to spare his old\nmother the fatigues of the long wait. His neighbour, the _citoyen_\nBrotteaux, went with him, calm and smiling, his Lucretius in the baggy\npocket of his plum-coloured coat.\n\nThe good old fellow enjoyed the scene, calling it a bit of low life\nworthy the brush of a modern Teniers.\n\n\"These street-porters and goodwives,\" he declared, \"are more amusing\nthan the Greeks and Romans our painters are so fond of nowadays. For my\npart, I have always admired the Flemish style.\"\n\nOne fact he was too sensible and tactful to mention--that he had\nhimself owned a gallery of Dutch masters rivalled only by Monsieur de\nChoiseul's in the number and excellence of the examples.\n\n\"Nothing is beautiful save the Antique,\" returned the painter, \"and what\nis inspired by it. Still, I grant you these low-life scenes by Teniers,\nJan Steen or Ostade are better stuff than the frills and furbelows of\nWatteau, Boucher, or Van Loo; humanity is shown in an ugly light, but it\nis not degraded as it is by a Baudouin or a Fragonard.\"\n\nA hawker went by bawling:\n\n\"_Bulletin of the Revolutionary Tribunal!_... list of the condemned!\"\n\n\"One Revolutionary Tribunal is not enough,\" said Gamelin, \"there should\nbe one in every town ... in every town, do I say?--nay, in every\nvillage, in every hamlet. Fathers of families, citizens, one and all,\nshould constitute themselves judges. At a time when the enemy's cannon\nis at her gates and the assassin's dagger at her throat, the Nation must\nhold mercy to be parricide. What! Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux in\ninsurrection, Corsica in revolt, La Vend\u00c3\u00a9e on fire, Mayence and\nValenciennes in the hands of the Coalition, treason in the country, town\nand camp, treason sitting on the very benches of the National\nConvention, treason assisting, map in hand, at the council board of our\nCommanders in the field!... The fatherland is in danger--and the\nguillotine must save her!\"\n\n\"I have no objection on principle to make to the guillotine,\" replied\nBrotteaux. \"Nature, my only mistress and my only instructress, certainly\noffers me no suggestion to the effect that a man's life is of any value;\non the contrary, she teaches in all kinds of ways that it is of none.\nThe sole end and object of living beings seems to be to serve as food\nfor other beings destined to the same end. Murder is of natural right;\ntherefore, the penalty of death is lawful, on condition it is exercised\nfrom no motives either of virtue or of justice, but by necessity or to\ngain some profit thereby. However, I must have perverse instincts, for I\nsicken to see blood flow, and this defect of character all my philosophy\nhas failed so far to correct.\"\n\n\"Republicans,\" answered \u00c3\u0089variste, \"are humane and full of feeling. It is\nonly despots hold the death penalty to be a necessary attribute of\nauthority. The sovereign people will do away with it one day.\nRobespierre fought against it, and all good patriots were with him; the\nlaw abolishing it cannot be too soon promulgated. But it will not have\nto be applied till the last foe of the Republic has perished beneath the\nsword of law and order.\"\n\nGamelin and Brotteaux had by this time a number of late comers behind\nthem and amongst these several women of the Section, including a\nstalwart, handsome _tricoteuse_, in head-kerchief and sabots, wearing a\nsword in a shoulder belt, a pretty girl with a mop of golden hair and a\nvery tumbled neckerchief, and a young mother, pale and thin, giving the\nbreast to a sickly infant.\n\nThe child, which could get no milk, was screaming, but its voice was\nweak and stifled by its sobs. Pitifully small, with a pallid, unhealthy\nskin and inflamed eyes, the mother gazed at it with mingled anxiety and\ngrief.\n\n\"He is very young,\" observed Gamelin, turning to look at the unhappy\ninfant groaning just at his back, half stifled amid the crowd of new\narrivals.\n\n\"He is six months, poor love!... His father is with the army; he is one\nof the men who drove back the Austrians at Cond\u00c3\u00a9. His name is Dumonteil\n(Michel), a draper's assistant by trade. He enlisted at a booth they had\nestablished in front of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville. Poor lad, he was all for\ndefending his country and seeing the world.... He writes telling me to\nbe patient. But pray, how am I to feed Paul (he's called Paul, you know)\nwhen I can't feed myself?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed the pretty girl with the flaxen hair, \"we've got\nanother hour before us yet, and to-night we shall have to repeat the\nsame ceremony over again at the grocer's. You risk your life to get\nthree eggs and a quarter of a pound of butter.\"\n\n\"Butter!\" sighed the _citoyenne_ Dumonteil, \"why, it's three months\nsince I've seen a scrap!\"\n\nAnd a chorus of female voices rose, bewailing the scarcity and dearness\nof provisions, cursing the _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s_ and devoting to the guillotine the\nCommissaries of Sections who were ready to give good-for-nothing minxes,\nin return for unmentionable services, fat hens and four-pound loaves.\nAlarming stories passed round of cattle drowned in the Seine, sacks of\nflour emptied in the sewers, loaves of bread thrown into the\nlatrines.... It was all those Royalists, and Rolandists, and Brissotins,\nwho were starving the people, bent on exterminating every living thing\nin Paris!\n\nAll of a sudden the pretty, fair-haired girl with the rumpled\nneckerchief broke into shrieks as if her petticoats were afire. She was\nshaking these violently and turning out her pockets, vociferating that\nsomebody had stolen her purse.\n\nAt news of the petty theft, a flood of indignation swept over this crowd\nof poor folks, the same who had sacked the mansions of the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain and invaded the Tuileries without appropriating the\nsmallest thing, artisans and housewives, who would have burned down the\nPalace of Versailles with a light heart, but would have thought it a\ndire disgrace if they had stolen the value of a pin. The young rakes\ngreeted the pretty girl's loss with some ribald jokes, that were\nimmediately drowned under a burst of public indignation. There was some\ntalk of instant execution--hanging the thief to the nearest lamp-post,\nand an investigation was begun, where everyone spoke at once and nobody\nwould listen to a word of reason. The tall _tricoteuse_, pointing her\nfinger at an old man, strongly suspected of being an unfrocked monk,\nswore it was the \"Capuchin\" yonder who was the cut-purse. The crowd\nbelieved her without further evidence and raised a shout of \"Death!\ndeath!\"\n\nThe old man so unexpectedly exposed to the public vengeance was standing\nvery quietly and soberly just in front of the _citoyen_ Brotteaux. He\nhad all the look, there was no denying it, of a _ci-devant_ cleric. His\naspect was venerable, though the face was changed and drawn by the\nterrors the poor man had suffered from the violence of the crowd and the\nrecollection of the September days that were still vivid in his\nimagination. The fear depicted on his features stirred the suspicion of\nthe populace, which is always ready to believe that only the guilty\ndread its judgments, as if the haste and recklessness with which it\npronounces them were not enough to terrify even the most innocent.\n\nBrotteaux had made it a standing rule never to go against the popular\nfeeling of the moment, above all when it was manifestly illogical and\ncruel, \"because in that case,\" he would say, \"the voice of the people\nwas the voice of God.\" But Brotteaux proved himself untrue to his\nprinciples; he asseverated that the old man, whether he was a Capuchin\nor not, could not have robbed the _citoyenne_, having never gone near\nher for one moment.\n\nThe crowd drew its own conclusion,--the individual who spoke up for the\nthief was of course his accomplice, and stern measures were proposed to\ndeal with the two malefactors, and when Gamelin offered to guarantee\nBrotteaux' honesty, the wisest heads suggested sending _him_ along with\nthe two others to the Sectional headquarters.\n\nBut the pretty girl gave a cry of delight; she had found her purse\nagain. The statement was received with a storm of hisses, and she was\nthreatened with a public whipping,--like a Nun.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the ex-monk, addressing Brotteaux, \"I thank you for having\nspoken in my defence. My name is of no concern, but I had better tell\nyou what it is; I am called Louis de Longuemare. I am in truth a\nRegular; but not a Capuchin, as those women would have it. There is the\nwidest difference; I am a monk of the Order of the Barnabites, which has\ngiven Doctors and Saints without number to the Church. It is only a\nhalf-truth to refer its origin to St. Charles Borromeo; we must account\nas the true founder the Apostle St. Paul, whose cipher it bears on its\narms. I have been compelled to quit my cloister, now headquarters of the\nSection du Pont-Neuf, and adopt a secular habit.\n\n\"Nay, Father,\" said Brotteaux, scrutinizing Monsieur de Longuemare's\nfrock, \"your dress is token enough that you have not forsworn your\nprofession; to look at it, one might think you had reformed your Order\nrather than forsaken it. It is your good heart makes you expose yourself\nin these austere habiliments to the insults of a godless populace.\"\n\n\"Yet I cannot very well,\" replied the ex-monk, \"wear a blue coat, like a\nroisterer at a dance!\"\n\n\"What I mention, Father, about your dress is by way of paying homage to\nyour character and putting you on your guard against the risks you run.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, sir, it would be much better to inspirit me to confess\nmy faith. For indeed, I am only too prone to fear danger. I have\nabandoned my habit, sir, which is a sort of apostasy; I would fain not\nhave deserted, had it been possible, the House where God granted me for\nso many years the grace of a peaceable and retired life. I got leave to\nstay there, and I still continued to occupy my cell, while they turned\nthe church and cloister into a sort of petty _h\u00c3\u00b4tel de ville_ they\ncalled the Section. I saw, sir, I saw them hack away the emblems of the\nHoly Verity; I saw the name of the Apostle Paul replaced by a convicted\nfelon's cap. Sometimes I was actually present at the confabulations of\nthe Section, where I heard amazing errors propounded. At last I quitted\nthis place of profanation and went to live on the pension of a hundred\npistoles allowed me by the Assembly in a stable that stood empty, the\nhorses having been requisitioned for the service of the armies. There I\nsing Mass for a few of the faithful, who come to the office to bear\nwitness to the eternity of the Church of Jesus Christ.\"\n\n\"For my part, Father,\" replied the other, \"if you care to know my name,\nI am called Brotteaux, and I was a publican in former days.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" returned the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, \"I was aware by St. Matthew's\nexample that one may look for good counsel from a publican.\"\n\n\"Father, you are too obliging.\"\n\n\"_Citoyen_ Brotteaux,\" remarked Gamelin, \"pray admire the virtues of the\npeople, more hungry for justice than for bread; consider how everyone\nhere is ready to lose his place to chastise the thief. These men and\nwomen, victims of such poverty and privation, are of so stern a probity\nthey cannot tolerate a dishonest act.\"\n\n\"It must indeed be owned,\" replied Brotteaux, \"that in their hearty\ndesire to hang the pilferer, these folks were like to do a mischief to\nthis good cleric, to his champion and to his champion's champion. Their\navarice itself and their selfish eagerness to safeguard their own\nwelfare were motives enough; the thief in attacking one of them\nthreatened all; self-preservation urged them to punish him.... At the\nsame time, it is like enough the most part of these workmen and\ngoodwives are honest and keep their hands off other folk's goods. From\nthe cradle these sentiments have been instilled in them by their father\nand mother, who have whipped them well and soundly and inculcated the\nvirtues through their backside.\"\n\nGamelin did not conceal the fact from his old neighbour that he deemed\nsuch language unworthy of a philosopher.\n\n\"Virtue,\" said he, \"is natural to mankind; God has planted the seed of\nit in the heart of mortals.\"\n\nOld Brotteaux was a sceptic and found in his atheism an abundant source\nof self-satisfaction.\n\n\"I see this much, _citoyen_ Gamelin, that, while a Revolutionary for\nwhat is of this world, you are, where Heaven is concerned, of a\nconservative, or even a reactionary temper. Robespierre and Marat are\nthe same to you. For me, I find it strange that Frenchmen, who will not\nput up with a mortal king any longer, insist on retaining an immortal\ntyrant, far more despotic and ferocious. For what is the Bastille, or\neven the _Chambre Ardente_[1] beside Hellfire? Humanity models its gods\non its tyrants, and you, who reject the original, preserve the copy!\"\n\n\"Oh! _citoyen!_\" protested Gamelin, \"are you not ashamed to hold such\nlanguage? how can you confound the dark divinities born of ignorance and\nfear with the Author of Nature? Belief in a benevolent God is necessary\nfor morality. The Supreme Being is the source of all the virtues and a\nman cannot be a Republican if he does not believe in God. Robespierre\nknew this, who, as we all remember, had the bust of the philosopher\nHelv\u00c3\u00a9tius removed from the Hall of the Jacobins, because he had taught\nFrenchmen the lessons of slavery by preaching atheism.... I hope, at\nleast, _citoyen_ Brotteaux, that, as soon as the Republic has\nestablished the worship of Reason, you will not refuse your adhesion to\nso wise a religion!\"\n\n\"I love reason, but I am no fanatic in my love,\" was Brotteaux's answer.\n\"Reason is our guide and beacon-light; but when you have made a divinity\nof it, it will blind you and instigate you to crime,\"--and he proceeded\nto develop his thesis, standing both feet in the kennel, as he had once\nbeen used to perorate, seated in one of Baron d'Holbach's gilt\narmchairs, which, as he was fond of saying, formed the basis of natural\nphilosophy.\n\n\"Jean Jacques Rousseau,\" he proceeded, \"who was not without talents,\nparticularly in music, was a scampish fellow who professed to derive his\nmorality from Nature while all the time he got it from the dogmas of\nCalvin. Nature teaches us to devour each other and gives us the example\nof all the crimes and all the vices which the social state corrects or\nconceals. We should love virtue; but it is well to know that this is\nsimply and solely a convenient expedient invented by men in order to\nlive comfortably together. What we call morality is merely a desperate\nenterprise, a forlorn hope, on the part of our fellow creatures to\nreverse the order of the universe, which is strife and murder, the blind\ninterplay of hostile forces. She destroys herself, and the more I think\nof things, the more convinced I am that the universe is mad. Theologians\nand philosophers, who make God the author of Nature and the architect of\nthe universe, show Him to us as illogical and ill-conditioned. They\ndeclare Him benevolent, because they are afraid of Him, but they are\nforced to admit that His acts are atrocious. They attribute a malignity\nto him seldom to be found even in mankind. And that is how they get\nhuman beings to adore Him. For our miserable race would never lavish\nworship on just and benevolent deities from which they would have\nnothing to fear; they would feel only a barren gratitude for their\nbenefits. Without purgatory and hell, your good God would be a mighty\npoor creature.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, \"do not talk of Nature; you do not know\nwhat Nature is.\"\n\n\"Egad, I know it as well as you do, Father.\"\n\n\"You cannot know it, because you have not religion, and religion alone\nteaches us what Nature is, wherein it is good, and how it has been made\nevil. However, you must not expect me to answer you; God has vouchsafed\nme, to refute your errors, neither eloquence nor force of intellect. I\nshould only be afraid, by my inadequate replies, of giving you occasion\nto blaspheme and further reasons for hardening your heart. I feel a\nstrong desire to help you; yet the sole fruit of my importunate efforts\nwould be to....\"\n\nThe discussion was cut short by a tremendous shout coming from the head\nof the column to warn the whole regiment of famished citizens that the\nbaker was opening his doors. The line began to push forward, but very,\nvery slowly. A National Guard on duty admitted the purchasers one by\none. The baker, his wife and boy presided over the sale, assisted by two\nCivil Commissaries. These, wearing a tricoloured riband round the left\narm, saw that the customers belonged to the Section and were given their\nproper share in proportion to the number of mouths to be filled.\n\nThe _citoyen_ Brotteaux made the quest of pleasure the one and only aim\nof life, holding that the reason and the senses, the sole judges when\ngods there were none, were unable to conceive any other. Accordingly,\nfinding the painter's remarks somewhat overfull of fanaticism, and the\nMonk's of simplicity, to please his taste, this wise man, bent on\nsquaring his behaviour with his views and relieving the tedium of\nwaiting, drew from the bulging pocket of his plum-coloured coat his\nLucretius, now as always his chiefest solace and faithful comforter. The\nbinding of red morocco was chafed by hard wear, and the _citoyen_\nBrotteaux had judiciously erased the coat of arms that once embellished\nit,--three islets or, which his father the financier had bought for\ngood money down. He opened the book at the passage where the poet\nphilosopher, who is for curing men of the futile and mischievous passion\nof love, surprises a woman in the arms of her serving-women in a state\nbound to offend all a lover's susceptibilities. The _citoyen_ Brotteaux\nread the lines, though not without casting a surreptitious glance at the\ngolden pate of the pretty girl in front of him and enjoying a sniff of\nthe heady perfume of the little slut's hot skin. The poet Lucretius was\na wise man, but he had only one string to his bow; his disciple\nBrotteaux had several.\n\nSo he read on, taking two steps forward every quarter of an hour. His\near, soothed by the grave and cadenced numbers of the Latin Muse, was\ndeaf to the women's scolding about the monstrous prices of bread and\nsugar and coffee, candles and soap. In this calm and unruffled mood he\nreached the threshold of the bakehouse. Behind him, \u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin\ncould see over his head the gilt cornsheaf surmounting the iron grating\nthat filled the fanlight over the door.\n\nWhen his turn came to enter the shop, he found the hampers and lockers\nalready emptied; the baker handed him the only scrap of bread left,\nwhich did not weigh two pounds. \u00c3\u0089variste paid his money, and the gate\nwas slammed on his heels, for fear of a riot and the people carrying the\nplace by storm.\n\nBut there was no need to fear; these poor folks, trained to obedience\nalike by their old-time oppressors and by their liberators of to-day,\nslunk off with drooping heads and dragging feet.\n\nAs he reached the corner of the street, Gamelin caught sight of the\n_citoyenne_ Dumonteil, seated on a stone post, her nursling in her\narms. She sat there quite still; her face was colourless and her\ntearless eyes seemed to see nothing. The infant was sucking her finger\nvoraciously. Gamelin stood a while in front of her, abashed and\nuncertain what to do. She did not appear to see him.\n\nHe stammered something, then pulled out his pocket-knife, a clasp-knife\nwith a horn handle, cut his loaf in two and laid half on the young\nmother's knee. She looked up at him in wonder; but he had already turned\nthe corner of the street.\n\nOn reaching home, \u00c3\u0089variste found his mother sitting at the window\ndarning stockings. With a light laugh he put his half of the bread in\nher hand.\n\n\"You must forgive me, mother dear; I was tired out with standing about\nand exhausted by the heat, and out in the street there as I trudged\nhome, mouthful by mouthful I have gobbled up half of our allowance.\nThere's barely your share left,\"--and as he spoke, he made a pretence of\nshaking the crumbs off his jacket.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] _Chambre Ardente_,--under the ancien r\u00c3\u00a9gime, a tribunal charged with\nthe investigation of heinous crimes and having power to burn those found\nguilty.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nEmploying a very old-fashioned locution, the _citoyenne_ Gamelin had\ndeclared: \"that by dint of eating chestnuts they would be turning into\nchestnuts.\" As a matter of fact, on that day, the 13th July, she and her\nson had made their midday dinner on a basin of chestnut porridge. As\nthey were finishing this austere repast, a lady pushed open the door and\nthe room was flooded in an instant with the splendour of her presence\nand the fragrance of her perfumes. \u00c3\u0089variste recognised the _citoyenne_\nRochemaure. Thinking she had mistaken the door and meant her visit for\nthe _citoyen_ Brotteaux, her friend of other days, he was already\npreparing to point her out the _ci-devant_ aristocrat's garret or\nperhaps summon Brotteaux and so spare an elegant woman the task of\nscrambling up a mill-ladder; but she made it clear at once that the\n_citoyen_ \u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin and no other was the person she had come to\nsee by announcing that she was happy to find him at home and was his\nservant to command.\n\nThey were not entirely strangers to each other, having met more than\nonce in David's studio, in a box at the Assembly Hall, at the Jacobins,\nat Venua's restaurant. On these occasions she had been struck by his\ngood looks and youth and interesting air.\n\nWearing a hat beribboned like a fairing and plumed like the head-piece\nof a Representative on mission, the _citoyenne_ Rochemaure was wigged,\npainted, patched and scented. But her complexion was young and fresh\nbehind all these disguises; these extravagant artificialities of fashion\nonly betokened a frantic haste to enjoy life and the feverishness of\nthese dreadful days when the morrow was so uncertain. Her corsage, with\nwide facings and enormous basques and all ablaze with huge steel\nbuttons, was blood-red, and it was hard to tell, so aristocratic and so\nrevolutionary at one and the same time was her array, whether it was the\ncolours of the victims or of the headsman that she sported. A young\nofficer, a dragoon, accompanied her.\n\nDandling her long cane by its handle of mother-o'-pearl, a tall, fine\nwoman, of generous proportions and ample bosom, she made the circuit of\nthe studio, and putting up to her grey eyes her double quizzing-glasses\nof gold, examined the painter's canvases with many smiles and\nexclamations of delight, admiring the handsome artist and flattering him\nin hopes of a return in kind.\n\n\"What,\" asked the _citoyenne_, \"is that picture--it is so nobly\nconceived, so touching--of a gentle, beautiful woman standing by a young\nman lying sick?\"\n\nGamelin told her it was meant to represent _Orestes tended by his sister\nElectra_, and that, had he been able to finish it, it might perhaps have\nbeen the least unsatisfactory of his works.\n\n\"The subject,\" he went on to say, \"is taken from the _Orestes_ of\nEuripides. I had read, in a translation of this tragedy made years ago,\na scene that filled me with admiration,--the one where the young\nElectra, raising her brother on his bed of pain, wipes away the froth\nthat gathers on his lips, puts aside the locks that blind his eyes and\nbeseeches the brother she loves to hearken to what she will tell him\nwhile the Furies are at peace for the moment.... As I read and re-read\nthis translation, I seemed to be aware of a kind of fog that shrouded\nthe forms of Greek perfection, a fog I could not drive away. I pictured\nthe original text to myself as more nervous and pitched in a different\naccent. Feeling a keen desire to get a precise idea of the thing, I went\nto Monsieur Gail, who was the Professor of Greek at the Coll\u00c3\u00a8ge de\nFrance (this was in '91), and begged him to expound the scene to me word\nby word. He did what I asked, and I then saw that the Ancients are much\nmore simple and homely than people think. Thus, for instance, Electra\nsays to Orestes: 'Dear brother, what joy it gave me to see thee sleep!\nShall I help thee to rise?' And Orestes answers: 'Yes, help me, take me\nin thy arms, and wipe away the spume that still clings about my mouth\nand eyes. Put thy bosom against mine and part from my brow my tangled\nhair, for it blinds my eyes....' My mind still full of this poetry, so\nyoung and vivid, ringing with these simple, strong phrases, I sketched\nthe picture you see there, _citoyenne_.\"\n\nThe painter, who, as a rule, spoke so sparingly of his works, waxed\neloquent on the subject of this one. At an encouraging gesture from the\n_citoyenne_ Rochemaure, who lifted her quizzing-glasses in token of\nattention, he continued:\n\n\"Hennequin has depicted the madness of Orestes in masterly fashion. But\nOrestes appeals to us still more poignantly in his sorrow than when he\nis distraught. What a fate was his! It was filial piety, obedience to a\nsacred obligation, drove him to commit his dreadful deed,--a sin the\ngods cannot but pardon, but which men will never condone. To avenge\noutraged justice, he has repudiated Nature, has made himself a monster,\nhas torn out his own heart. But his spirit remains unbroken under the\nweight of his horrible, yet innocent crime.... That is what I would fain\nhave exhibited in my group of brother and sister.\" He stepped up to the\ncanvas and looked at it not without satisfaction.\n\n\"Parts of the picture,\" he said, \"are pretty nearly finished; the head\nand arm of Orestes, for instance.\"\n\n\"It is an admirable composition.... And Orestes reminds me of you,\n_citoyen_ Gamelin.\"\n\n\"You think he is like me?\" exclaimed the painter, with a grave smile.\n\nShe took the chair Gamelin offered her. The young dragoon stood beside\nher, his hand on the back of the chair on which she sat. Which showed\nplainly that the Revolution was an accomplished fact, for under the\nancien r\u00c3\u00a9gime, no man would ever, in company, have touched so much as\nwith the tip of a finger, the seat occupied by a lady. In those days a\ngentleman was trained and broken in to the laws of politeness, sometimes\npretty hard laws, and taught to understand that a scrupulous\nself-restraint in public places gives a peculiar zest to the sweet\nfamiliarity of the boudoir, and that to lose your respectful awe of a\nwoman, you must first have that feeling.\n\nLouise Masch\u00c3\u00a9 de Rochemaure, daughter of a Lieutenant of the King's\nHunt, widow of a Procureur and, for twenty years, the faithful mistress\nof the financier Brotteaux des Ilettes, had fallen in with the new\nideas. She was to be seen, in July, 1790, digging the soil of the Champ\nde Mars. Her strong inclination to side with the powers that be had\ncarried her readily enough along a political path that started with the\nFeuillants and led by way of the Girondins to end on the summit of _the\nMountain_, while at the same time a spirit of compromise, a passion for\nconversion and a certain aptitude for intrigue still attached her to the\naristocratic and anti-revolutionary party. She was to be met\neverywhere,--at coffee houses and theatres, fashionable restaurants,\ngaming-saloons, drawing-rooms, newspaper offices and ante-chambers of\nCommittees. The Revolution yielded her a hundred satisfactions,--novelty\nand amusement, smiles and pleasures, business ventures and profitable\nspeculations. Combining political with amorous intrigue, playing the\nharp, drawing landscapes, singing ballads, dancing Greek dances, giving\nsupper parties, entertaining pretty women, such as the Comtesse de\nBeaufort and the actress Mademoiselle Descoings, presiding all night\nlong over a _trente-et-un_ or _biribi_ table and an adept at _rouge et\nnoir_, she still found time to be charitable to her friends. Inquisitive\nand interfering, giddy-pated and frivolous, she understood men but knew\nnothing of the masses; as indifferent to the creed she professed as to\nthe opinions she felt bound to repudiate, understanding nothing whatever\nof all that was happening in the country, she was enterprising,\nintrepid, and full of audacity from sheer ignorance of danger and an\nunbounded confidence in the efficacy of her charms.\n\nThe soldier who escorted her was in the heyday of youth. A brazen helmet\ndecorated with a panther skin and the crest set off with a crimson\ncock's-comb shaded his fresh young face and displayed a long and\nterrific mane that swept his back. His red jacket was cut short and\nsquare, barely reaching to the waist, the better to show off his elegant\nfigure. In his girdle he carried an enormous sabre, the hilt of which\nwas a glittering eagle's beak. A pair of flapped breeches of sky blue\nmoulded the fine muscles of his legs and was braided in rich arabesques\nof a darker blue on the thighs. He might have been a dancer dressed for\nsome warlike and dashing r\u00c3\u00b4le, in _Achilles at Scyros_ or _Alexander's\nWedding-feast_, in a costume designed by a pupil of David with the one\nidea of accentuating every line of the shape.\n\nGamelin had a vague recollection of having seen him before. He was, in\nfact, the same young soldier he had come upon a fortnight previously\nharanguing the people from the arcades of the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre de la Nation.\n\nThe _citoyenne_ Rochemaure introduced him by name:\n\n\"The _citoyen_ Henry, Member of the Revolutionary Committee of the\nSection of the Rights of Man.\"\n\nShe had him always at her heels,--a mirror of gallantry and a living and\nwalking guarantee of patriotism.\n\nThe _citoyenne_ complimented Gamelin on his talents and asked him if he\nwould be willing to design a card for a prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e of hers, a fashionable\nmilliner. He would, of course, choose an appropriate _motif_,--a woman\ntrying on a scarf before a cheval glass, for instance, or a young\nworkwoman carrying a band-box on her arm.\n\nShe had heard several artists mentioned as competent to execute a little\nmatter of the sort,--Fragonard _fils_, young Ducis, as well as a certain\nPrudhomme; but she would rather apply to the _citoyen_ \u00c3\u0089variste\nGamelin. However, she made no definite proposal on this head and it was\nevident she had mentioned the commission merely by way of starting the\nconversation. In truth she had come for something quite different. She\nwanted the _citoyen_ Gamelin to do her a favour; knowing he was a friend\nof the _citoyen_ Marat, she had come to ask him to introduce her to the\nFriend of the People, with whom she desired an interview.\n\nGamelin replied that he was too insignificant an individual to present\nher to Marat, besides which, she had no need of anyone to be her\nsponsor; Marat, albeit overwhelmed with business, was not the\ninaccessible person he was said to be,--and, added Gamelin:\n\n\"He will receive you, _citoyenne_, if you are in distress; his great\nheart makes him compassionate to all who suffer. He will likewise\nreceive you if you have any revelation to make concerning the public\nweal; he has vowed his days to the unmasking of traitors.\"\n\nThe _citoyenne_ Rochemaure answered that she would be happy to greet in\nMarat an illustrious citizen, who had rendered great services to his\ncountry, who was capable of rendering greater still, and that she was\nanxious to bring the legislator in question into relation with friends\nof hers of good repute and good will, philanthropists favoured by\nfortune and competent to provide him with new means of satisfying his\nardent affection for humanity.\n\n\"It is very desirable,\" she concluded, \"to make the rich co-operate in\nsecuring public prosperity.\"\n\nIn actual fact, the _citoyenne_ had promised the banker Morhardt to\narrange a dinner where he and Marat should meet.\n\nMorhardt, a Swiss like the Friend of the People, had entered into a\ncombination with several deputies of the Convention, Julien (of\nToulouse), Delaunay (of Angers) and the ex-Capuchin Chabot, to speculate\nin the shares of the _Compagnie des Indes_. The game was very\nsimple,--to bring down the price of these shares to 650 livres by\nproposing motions pointing in the direction of confiscation, in order to\nbuy up the greatest possible number at this figure and then push them up\nto 4,000 or 5,000 livres by dint of proposals of a reassuring nature.\nBut for Chabot, Julien, Delaunay, their little ways were too notorious,\nwhile suspicions were rife of Lacroix, Fabre d'\u00c3\u0089glantine, and even\nDanton. The arch-speculator, the Baron de Batz, was looking for new\nconfederates in the Convention and had advised Morhardt to sound Marat.\n\nThis idea of the anti-revolutionary speculators was not so extravagant\nas might have been supposed at the first blush. It was always the way of\nthese gentry to form alliance with those in power at the moment, and by\nvirtue of his popularity, his pen, his character, Marat was a power to\nbe reckoned with. The Girondists were near shipwreck; the Dantonists,\nbattered by the hurricane, had lost their hold on the helm. Robespierre,\nthe idol of the people, was a man jealous of his scrupulous honesty,\nfull of suspicion, impossible to approach. The great thing was to get\nround Marat, to secure his good will against the day when he should be\ndictator--and everything pointed to this consummation,--his popularity,\nhis ambition, his eagerness to recommend heroic measures. And it might\nbe, after all, Marat would re-establish order, the finances, the\nprosperity of the country. More than once he had risen in revolt\nagainst the zealots who were for outbidding him in fanaticism; for some\ntime past he had been denouncing the demagogues as vehemently as the\nmoderates. After inciting the people to sack the \"cornerers'\" shops and\nhang them over their own counters, he was now exhorting the citizens to\nbe calm and prudent. He was growing into an administrator.\n\nIn spite of certain rumours disseminated against him as against all the\nother chiefs of the Revolution, these pirates of the money-market did\nnot believe he could be corrupted, but they did know him to be vain and\ncredulous, and they hoped to win him over by flattery and still more by\na condescending friendliness which they looked upon as the most\nseductive form of flattery from men like themselves. They counted,\nthanks to him, on blowing hot and cold on all the securities they might\nwish to buy and sell, and making him serve their interests while\nsupposing himself to be acting solely for the public good.\n\nGreat as a go-between, albeit she was still of an age for amours on her\nown account, the _citoyenne_ Rochemaure had made it her mission to bring\ntogether the legislator-journalist and the banker, and in her\nextravagant imagination she already saw the man of the underworld, the\nman whose hands were yet red with the blood of the September massacres,\na partner in the game of the financiers whose agent she was; she\npictured him drawn by his very warmth of feeling and unsophisticated\ncandour into the whirlpool of speculation, a recruit to the c\u00c3\u00b4terie she\nloved of \"corner\" makers, contractors, foreign emissaries, gamblers, and\nwomen of gallantry.\n\nShe insisted on the _citoyen_ Gamelin taking her to see the Friend of\nthe People, who lived quite near, in the Rue des Cordeliers, near the\nchurch. After some little show of reluctance, the painter acceded to the\n_citoyenne's_ wishes.\n\nThe dragoon Henry was invited to join them in the visit, but declined,\ndeclaring he meant to keep his liberty of action, even towards the\n_citoyen_ Marat, who, he felt no doubt, had rendered services to the\nRepublic, but was weakening nowadays; had he not, in his news sheet,\ncounselled resignation as the proper thing for the people of Paris?\n\nAnd the young man, in a sweet voice, broken by long-drawn sighs,\ndeplored the fate of the Republic, betrayed by the men in whom she had\nput her trust,--Danton rejecting the notion of a tax on the rich,\nRobespierre opposing the permanence of the Sections, Marat, whose\npusillanimous counsels were paralyzing the enthusiasm of the citizens.\n\n\"Ah!\" he cried, \"how feeble such men appear beside Leclerc and Jacques\nRoux!... Roux! Leclerc! _ye_ are the true friends of the people!\"\n\nGamelin did not hear these remarks, which would have angered him; he had\ngone into the next room to don his blue coat.\n\n\"You may well be proud of your son,\" observed the _citoyenne_\nRochemaure, addressing the _citoyenne_ Gamelin. \"He is a great man;\ntalent and character both make him so.\"\n\nIn answer, the widow Gamelin gave a good account of her son, yet without\nmaking much boast of him before a lady of high station, for she had been\ntaught in her childhood that the first duty of the lowly is humility\ntowards the great. She was of a complaining bent, having indeed only too\ngood cause and finding in such jeremiads a salve for her griefs. She was\ngarrulous in her revelations of all the hardships she had to bear to\nany whom she supposed in a position to relieve them, and Madame de\nRochemaure seemed to belong to that class. She made the most, therefore,\nof this favourable opportunity and told a long and breathless story of\ntheir distresses,--how mother and son were both dying of slow\nstarvation. Pictures could not be sold any more; the Revolution had\nkilled business dead. Victuals were scarce and too dear for words....\n\nThe good dame poured out her lamentations with all the loose-lipped\nvolubility her halting tongue was capable of, so as to get them all\nfinished by the time her son, whose pride would not brook such whining,\nshould reappear. She was bent on attaining her object in the shortest\npossible time,--that of touching a lady whom she deemed rich and\ninfluential, and enlisting her sympathy in her boy's future. She felt\nsure that \u00c3\u0089variste's good looks were an asset on her side to move the\nheart of a well-born lady. And so they were; the _citoyenne_ Rochemaure\nproved tender-hearted and was melted to think of \u00c3\u0089variste's and his\nmother's sufferings. She made plans to alleviate them; she had rich men\namongst her friends and would get them to buy the artist's pictures.\n\n\"The truth is,\" she added, with a smile, \"there is still money in\nFrance, but it keeps in hiding.\"\n\nBetter still, now Art was ruined, she would obtain \u00c3\u0089variste a post in\nMorhardt's bank or with the Brothers Perregaux, or a place as clerk in\nthe office of an army contractor.\n\nThen she reflected that this was not what a man of his character needed;\nand, after a moment's thought, she nodded in sign that she had hit the\nnail on the head:\n\n\"There are still several jurymen left to be appointed on the\nRevolutionary Tribunal. Juryman, magistrate, that is the thing to suit\nyour son. I have friendly relations with the Committee of Public Safety.\nI know Robespierre the elder personally; his brother frequently sups at\nmy house. I will speak to them. I will get a word said to Montan\u00c3\u00a9,\nDumas, Fouquier.\"\n\nThe _citoyenne_ Gamelin, bursting with excitement and gratitude, put a\nfinger to her lip; \u00c3\u0089variste was coming back into the studio.\n\nHe escorted the _citoyenne_ Rochemaure down the gloomy staircase, the\nsteps of which, whether of wood or tiled, were coated with an ancient\nlayer of dirt.\n\nOn the Pont-Neuf, where the sun, now near its setting, threw a\nlengthened shadow from the pedestal that had borne the Bronze Horse and\nwas now gay with the National colours, a crowd of men and women of the\npeople gathered in little groups were listening to some tale that was\nbeing told them. Consternation reigned and a heavy silence, broken at\nintervals by groans and fierce cries. Many were making off at a rapid\npace in the direction of the Rue de Thionville, erstwhile Rue Dauphine;\nGamelin joined one of these groups and heard the news--that Marat had\njust been assassinated.\n\nLittle by little the tidings were confirmed and particulars became\nknown; he had been murdered in his bath by a woman who had come\nexpressly from Caen to commit the crime.\n\nSome thought she had escaped; but the majority declared she had been\narrested.\n\nThere they stood like sheep without a shepherd, thinking sadly:\n\n\"Marat, the tender-hearted, the humane, Marat our benefactor, is no\nlonger there to guide us, Marat who was never deceived, who saw through\nevery subterfuge and never feared to reveal the truth!... What can we\ndo, what is to become of us? We have lost our adviser, our champion, our\nfriend.\" They knew very well whence the blow had come, and who had\ndirected the woman's arm. They groaned aloud:\n\n\"Marat has been struck down by the same criminal hands that are bent on\nour extermination. His death is the signal for the slaughter of all good\npatriots.\"\n\nDifferent reports were current, as to the circumstances of the tragic\nevent and the last words of the victim; endless questions were asked\nconcerning the assassin, all that anyone knew was that it was a young\nwoman sent by those traitors, the federalists. Baring teeth and nails,\nthe _citoyennes_ devoted the culprit to condign punishment; deeming the\nguillotine too merciful a death, they demanded this monster of iniquity\nshould be scourged, broken on the wheel, torn limb from limb, and racked\ntheir brains to invent new tortures.\n\nAn armed body of National Guards was haling to the Section headquarters\na man of determined mien. His clothes were in tatters, and streams of\nblood trickled down his white face. He had been overheard saying that\nMarat had earned his fate by his constant incitements to pillage and\nmassacre, and it was only with great difficulty that the Guards had\nsaved him from the fury of the populace. A hundred fingers pointed him\nout as the accomplice of the assassin, and threats of death followed him\nas he was led away.\n\nGamelin was stunned by the blow. A few hot tears blistered his burning\neyes. With the grief he felt as a disciple mingled solicitude for the\npopular idol, and these combined feelings tore at his heart-strings. He\nthought to himself:\n\n\"After Le Peltier, after Bourdon, Marat!... I foresee the fate of the\npatriots; massacred on the Champ de Mars, at Nancy, at Paris, they will\nperish one and all.\" And he thought of Wimpfen, the traitor, who only a\nwhile before was marching on Paris, and who, had he not been stopped at\nVernon, by the gallant patriots, would have devoted the heroic city to\nfire and slaughter.\n\nAnd how many perils still remained, how many criminal designs, how many\ntreasonable plots, which only Marat's perspicacity and vigilance could\nunravel and foil! Now he was dead, who was there to denounce Custine\nloitering in idleness in the Camp of C\u00c3\u00a6sar and refusing to relieve\nValenciennes, Biron tarrying inactive in the Lower Vend\u00c3\u00a9e letting Saumur\nbe taken and Nantes blockaded, Dillon betraying the Fatherland in the\nArgonne?...\n\nMeantime, all about him, rose momentarily higher the sinister cry:\n\n\"Marat is dead; the aristocrats have killed him!\"\n\nAs he was on his way, his heart bursting with grief and hate and love,\nto pay a last mark of respect to the martyr of liberty, an old\ncountrywoman, wearing the coif of the Limousin peasantry, accosted him\nto ask if the Monsieur Marat who had been murdered was not Monsieur le\nCur\u00c3\u00a9 Mara, of Saint-Pierre-de-Queyroix.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nIt was the eve of the Festival, a calm, bright evening, and \u00c3\u0089lodie\nhanging on \u00c3\u0089variste's arm, was strolling with him about the _Champ de la\nF\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ration_. Workmen were hastily completing their task of erecting\ncolumns, statues, temples, a \"mountain,\" an altar of the Fatherland.\nHuge symbolic figures, Hercules (representing the people) brandishing\nhis club, Nature suckling the Universe from her inexhaustible breasts,\nwere rising at a moment's notice in the capital that, tortured by famine\nand fear, was listening for the dreaded sound of the Austrian cannon on\nthe road from Meaux. La Vend\u00c3\u00a9e was making good its check before Nantes\nby a series of startling victories. A ring of fire and flame and hate\nwas drawn about the great revolutionary city.\n\nAnd meantime, she was preparing a superb welcome, like the sovereign\nstate of a vast empire, for the deputies of the primary Assemblies which\nhad accepted the Constitution. Federalism was on its knees; the\nRepublic, one and indivisible, would surely vanquish all its enemies.\n\nWaving his arm towards the thronged expanse:\n\n\"There it was,\" cried \u00c3\u0089variste, \"that on the 17th July, '91, the\ninfamous Bailly ordered the people to be shot down at the foot of the\naltar of the fatherland. Passavant, the grenadier, who witnessed the\nmassacre, returned to his house, tore his coat from his back and cried:\n'I have sworn to die with Liberty; Liberty is no more, and I fulfil my\noath,'--and blew out his brains.\"\n\nAll this time artists and peaceful citizens were examining the\npreparations for the festival, their faces showing as joyless a joy in\nlife as their lives were dull and joyless; to their minds the mightiest\nevents shrank into insignificance and grew as insipid as they were\nthemselves. Couple by couple they went, carrying in their arms or\nholding by the hand or letting them run on in front children as\nunprepossessing as their parents and promising to grow up no whit\nhappier, who in due course would give birth to children of their own as\npoor in spirit and looks as they. Yet now and again a young girl would\npass, tall and fair and desirable, rousing in young men a not ignoble\npassion to possess, and in the old regret for the bliss they had missed.\n\nNear the _\u00c3\u0089cole Militaire_ \u00c3\u0089variste pointed out to his companion the\nEgyptian statues designed by David on Roman models of the age of\nAugustus, and they overheard a Parisian, an old man with powdered hair,\nejaculate to himself:\n\n\"Egad! you might think yourself on the banks of the Nile!\"\n\nIt was three days since \u00c3\u0089lodie had seen her lover, and serious events\nhad befallen meantime at the _Amour peintre_. The _citoyen_ Blaise had\nbeen denounced to the Committee of General Security for fraudulent\ndealings in the matter of supplies to the armies. Fortunately for\nhimself, the print-dealer was well known in his Section; the Committee\nof Surveillance of the _Section des Piques_ had stood guarantee of his\npatriotism with the general committee and had completely justified his\nconduct.\n\nThis alarming incident \u00c3\u0089lodie now recounted in trembling accents,\nconcluding:\n\n\"We are quiet now, but the alarm was a hot one. A little more and my\nfather would have been clapped in prison. If the danger had lasted a few\nhours more, I should have come to you, \u00c3\u0089variste, to make interest for\nhim among your influential friends.\"\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste vouchsafed no reply to this, but \u00c3\u0089lodie was very far from\nrealizing all his silence portended.\n\nThey went on hand in hand along the banks of the river, discoursing of\ntheir mutual fondness in the phrases of Julie and Saint-Preux; the good\nJean-Jacques gave them the colours to paint and prank their love withal.\n\nThe Municipality of Paris had wrought a miracle,--abundance reigned for\na day in the famished city. A fair was installed on the _Place des\nInvalides_, beside the Seine, where hucksters in booths sold sausages,\nsaveloys, chitterlings, hams decked with laurels, Nanterre cakes,\ngingerbreads, pancakes, four-pound loaves, lemonade and wine. There were\nstalls also for the sale of patriotic songs, cockades, tricolour\nribands, purses, pinchbeck watch-chains and all sorts of cheap gewgaws.\nStopping before the display of a petty jeweller, \u00c3\u0089variste selected a\nsilver ring having a head of Marat in relief with a silk handkerchief\nwound about the brows, and put it on \u00c3\u0089lodie's finger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe same evening Gamelin proceeded to the Rue de l'Arbre-Sec to call on\nthe _citoyenne_ Rochemaure, who had sent for him on pressing business.\nShe received him in her bedchamber, reclining on a couch in a seductive\ndishabille.\n\nWhile the _citoyenne's_ attitude expressed a voluptuous languor,\neverything about her spoke of her accomplishments, her diversions, her\ntalents,--a harp beside an open harpsichord, a guitar on a chair, an\nembroidering frame with a square of satin stretched on it, a\nhalf-finished miniature on a table among papers and books, a bookcase in\ndire disorder as if rifled by the hand of a fair reader as eager to know\nas to feel.\n\nShe gave him her hand to kiss, and addressed him:\n\n\"Greeting, sir juryman!... This very day Robespierre the elder gave me a\nletter in your favour to be handed to the President Herman, a very well\nturned letter, pretty much to this effect:\n\n\"I bring to your notice the _citoyen_ Gamelin, commendable alike for his\ntalents and for his patriotism. I have made it my duty to make known to\nyou a patriot whose principles are good and his conduct steadfast in the\nright line of revolution. You will not let slip the opportunity of being\nuseful to a Republican.... This letter I carried there and then to the\nPresident Herman, who received me with an exquisite politeness and\nsigned your appointment on the spot. The thing is done.\"\n\nAfter a moment's pause:\n\n\"_Citoyenne_,\" said Gamelin, \"though I have not a morsel of bread to\ngive my mother, I swear on my honour I accept the duties of a juror only\nto serve the Republic and avenge her on her foes.\"\n\nThe _citoyenne_ thought this but a cold way of expressing gratitude and\nconsidered the sentiment high-flown. The young man was no adept, she\nsuspected, at graceful courtesies. But she was too great an admirer of\nyouth not to excuse some little lack of polish. Gamelin was a handsome\nfellow, and that was merit enough in her eyes. \"We will form him,\" she\nsaid to herself. So she invited him to her suppers to which she welcomed\nher friends every evening after the theatre.\n\n\"You will meet at my house men of wit and talent,--Elleviou, Talma, the\n_citoyen_ Vig\u00c3\u00a9e, who turns bouts-rim\u00c3\u00a9s with a marvellous aptitude. The\n_citoyen_ Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois read us his 'Pam\u00c3\u00a9la' the other day, the piece\nrehearsing at the present moment at the _Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre de la Nation_. The\nstyle is elegant and chaste, as everything is that comes from the\n_citoyen_ Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois' pen. The plot is touching; it brought tears to all\nour eyes. It is the young _citoyenne_ Lange who is to take the part of\n'Pam\u00c3\u00a9la.'\"\n\n\"I believe it if you say so, _citoyenne_,\" answered Gamelin, \"but the\n_Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre de la Nation_ is scarcely National and it is hard on the\n_citoyen_ Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois that his works should be produced on the boards\ndegraded by the contemptible verses of a Laya; the people has not\nforgotten the scandal of the _Ami des Lois_....\"\n\n\"Nay, _citoyen_ Gamelin, say what you will of Laya; he is none of my\nfriends.\"\n\nIt was not purely out of kindness that the _citoyenne_ had employed her\ncredit to get Gamelin appointed to a much envied post; after what she\nhad done for him and what peradventure she might come to do for him in\nthe future, she counted on binding him closely to her interests and in\nthat way securing for herself a protector connected with a tribunal she\nmight one day or another have to reckon with; for the fact is, she was\nin constant correspondence with the French provinces and foreign\ncountries, and at that date such a circumstance was ground enough for\nsuspicion.\n\n\"Do you often go to the theatre, _citoyen_?\"\n\nAs she asked the question, Henry, the dragoon, entered the room, looking\nmore charming than the youthful Bathyllus. A brace of enormous pistols\nwas passed through his belt.\n\nHe kissed the fair _citoyenne's_ hand. Turning to him:\n\n\"There stands the _citoyen_ \u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin,\" she said, \"for whose sake\nI have spent the day at the Committee of General Security, and who is an\nungrateful wretch. Scold him for me.\"\n\n\"Ah! _citoyenne_,\" cried the young soldier, \"you have seen our\nLegislators at the Tuileries. What an afflicting sight! Is it seemly the\nRepresentatives of a free people should sit beneath the roof of a\ndespot? The same lustres that once shone on the plots of Capet and the\norgies of Antoinette now illumine the deliberations of our law-makers.\n'Tis enough to make Nature shudder.\"\n\n\"Pray, congratulate the _citoyen_ Gamelin,\" was all her answer, \"he is\nappointed juryman on the Revolutionary Tribunal.\"\n\n\"My compliments, _citoyen_!\" said Henry. \"I am rejoiced to see a man of\nyour character invested with these functions. But, to speak truth, I\nhave small confidence in this systematic justice, set up by the\nmoderates of the Convention, in this complaisant Nemesis that is\nconsiderate to conspirators and merciful to traitors, that hardly dares\nstrike a blow at the Federalists and fears to summon _the Austrian_ to\nthe bar. No, it is not the Revolutionary Tribunal will save the\nRepublic. They are very culpable, the men who, in the desperate\nsituation we are in, have arrested the flowing torrent of popular\njustice!\"\n\n\"Henry,\" interrupted the _citoyenne_ Rochemaure, \"pass me that scent\nbottle, please....\"\n\nOn reaching home, Gamelin found his mother and old Brotteaux playing a\ngame of piquet by the light of a smoky tallow-candle. At the moment the\nold woman was calling \"sequence of kings\" without the smallest scruple.\n\nWhen she heard her son was appointed juryman, she kissed him in a\ntransport of triumph, thinking what an honour it was for both of them\nand that henceforth they would have plenty to eat every day.\n\n\"I am proud and happy,\" she declared, \"to be the mother of a juryman.\nJustice is a fine thing, and of all the most necessary; without justice\nthe weak would be harassed every moment of their lives. And I think you\nwill give right judgment, \u00c3\u0089variste, my own boy; for from a child I have\nfound you just and kind-hearted in all concerns. You could never endure\nwrong-doing and always tried what you could to hinder violence. You\ncompassionated the unfortunate and that is the finest jewel in a juror's\ncrown.... But tell me, \u00c3\u0089variste, how are you dressed in your grand\ntribunal?\"\n\nGamelin informed her that the judges wore a hat with black plumes, but\nthat the jury had no special costume, that they were dressed in their\nevery-day attire.\n\n\"It would be better,\" returned the good woman, \"if they wore wig and\ngown; it would inspire more respect. Though you are mostly dressed\ncarelessly, you are a handsome man and you set off your clothes; but the\nmajority of men need some fine feathers to make them look imposing; yes,\nthe jury should have wigs and gowns.\"\n\nThe _citoyenne_ had heard say that the duties of a juror of the Tribunal\ncarried a salary; and she had no hesitation in asking the question\nwhether the emoluments were enough to live respectably on, for a\njuryman, she opined, ought to cut a good figure in the world.\n\nShe was pleased to hear that each juror received an allowance of\neighteen livres for every sitting and that the multiplicity of crimes\nagainst the security of the State obliged the court to sit very\nfrequently.\n\nOld Brotteaux gathered up the cards, rose from the table and addressing\nGamelin:\n\n\"_Citoyen_,\" he said, \"you are invested with an august and redoubtable\noffice. I congratulate you on lending the light of your integrity to a\ntribunal more trustworthy and less fallible perhaps than any other,\nbecause it searches out good and evil, not in themselves and in their\nessence, but solely in relation to tangible interests and plain and\nobvious sentiments. You will have to determine betwixt hate and love,\nwhich is done spontaneously, not betwixt truth and falsehood, to\ndiscriminate which is impossible for the feeble mind of man. Giving\njudgment after the impulses of your heart, you will run no risk of\nmistake, inasmuch as the verdict will be good provided it satisfy the\npassions that are your sacred law. But, all the same, if I was your\nPresident, I should imitate Bridoie, I should appeal to the arbitrament\nof the dice. In matters of justice it is still the surest plan.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin was to enter on his duties on the 14th September, when\nthe reorganization of the Tribunal was complete, according to which it\nwas henceforth subdivided into four sections with fifteen jurors for\neach. The prisons were full to overflowing; the Public Prosecutor was\nworking eighteen hours a day. Defeats in the field, revolts in the\nprovinces, conspiracies, plots, betrayals, the Convention had one\npanacea for them all,--terror. The Gods were athirst.\n\nThe first act of the new juror was to pay a visit of ceremony to the\nPresident Herman, who charmed him by the amiability of his conversation\nand the courtesy of his bearing. A compatriot and friend of\nRobespierre's, whose sentiments he shared, he showed every sign of a\nfeeling and virtuous temper. He was deeply attached to those humane\nsentiments, too long foreign to the heart of our judges, that redound to\nthe everlasting glory of a Dupaty and a Beccaria. He looked with\ncomplacency on the greater mildness of modern manners as evidenced, in\njudicial matters, by the abolition of torture and of ignominious or\ncruel forms of punishment. He was rejoiced to see the death penalty,\nonce so recklessly inflicted and employed till quite lately for the\nrepression of the most trifling offences, applied less frequently and\nreserved for heinous crimes. For his own part, he agreed with\nRobespierre and would gladly have seen it abolished altogether, except\nonly in cases touching the public safety. At the same time, he would\nhave deemed it treason to the State not to adjudge the punishment of\ndeath for crimes against the National Sovereignty.\n\nAll his colleagues were of like mind; the old Monarchical idea of\nreasons of State still inspired the Revolutionary Tribunal. Eight\ncenturies of absolute power had moulded the magisterial conscience, and\nit was by the principles of Divine Right that the Court even now tried\nand sentenced the enemies of Liberty.\n\nThe same day \u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin sought an interview with the Public\nProsecutor, the _citoyen_ Fouquier, who received him in the Cabinet\nwhere he used to work with his clerk of the court. He was a sturdily\nbuilt man, with a rough voice, catlike eyes, bearing in his pock-marked\nface and leaden complexion marks of the mischief wrought by a sedentary\nand indoor life on a vigorous constitution adapted to the open air and\nviolent exercise. Towering piles of papers shut him in like the walls of\na tomb, and it was plain to see he was in his element amid all these\ndreadful documents that seemed like to bury him alive. His conversation\nwas that of a hard-working magistrate, a man devoted to his task and\nwhose mind never left the narrow groove of his official duties. His\nfiery breath reeked of the brandy he took to keep up his strength; but\nthe liquor seemed never to fly to his brain, so clear-headed, albeit\nentirely commonplace, was every word he uttered.\n\nHe lived in a small suite of rooms in the Palais de Justice with his\nyoung wife, who had given him twin boys. His wife, an aunt Henriette and\nthe maid-servant P\u00c3\u00a9lagie made up the whole household. He was good and\nkind to these women. In a word, he was an excellent person in his family\nand professional relations, with a scarcity of ideas and a total lack of\nimagination.\n\nGamelin could not help being struck unpleasantly by the close\nresemblance in temper and ways of thought between the new magistrates\nand their predecessors under the old r\u00c3\u00a9gime. In fact, they were of the\nold r\u00c3\u00a9gime; Herman had held the office of Advocate General to the\nCouncil of Artois; Fouquier was a former Procureur at the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet. They\nhad preserved their character, whereas Gamelin believed in a\nRevolutionary palingenesis.\n\nQuitting the precincts of the court, he passed along the great gallery\nof the Palace and halted in front of the shops where articles of every\nsort and kind were exposed for sale in the most attractive fashion.\nStanding before the _citoyenne_ T\u00c3\u00a9not's stall, he turned over sundry\nhistorical, political, and philosophical works:--\"The Chains of\nSlavery,\" \"An Essay on Despotism,\" \"The Crimes of Queens.\" \"Very good!\"\nhe thought, \"here is Republican stuff!\" and he asked the woman if she\nsold a great many of these books. She shook her head:\n\n\"The only things that sell are songs and romances,\"--and pulling a\nduodecimo volume out of a drawer:\n\n\"Here,\" she told him, \"here we have something good.\"\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste read the title: \"La Religieuse en chemise,\" \"The Nun in\ndishabille!\"\n\nBefore the next shop he came upon Philippe Desmahis, who, with a tender,\nconquering-hero air, among the _citoyenne_ Saint-Jorre's perfumes and\npowders and sachets, was assuring the fair tradeswoman of his undying\nlove, promising to paint her portrait and begging her to vouchsafe him a\nmoment's talk that evening in the Tuileries gardens. There was no\nresisting him; persuasion sat on his lips and beamed from his eye. The\n_citoyenne_ Saint-Jorre was listening without a word, her eyes on the\nground, only too ready to believe him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWishing to familiarize himself with the awful duties imposed on him, the\nnew juror resolved to mingle with the throng and look on at a case\nbefore the Tribunal as a member of the general public. He climbed the\ngreat stairs on which a vast crowd was seated as in an amphitheatre and\npushed his way into the ancient Hall of the Parlement of Paris.\n\nThis was crammed to suffocation; some General or other was taking his\ntrial. For in those days, as old Brotteaux put it, \"the Convention,\ncopying the example of His Britannic Majesty's Government, made a point\nof arraigning beaten Generals, in default of traitorous Generals, the\nlatter taking good care not to stand their trial. Not that a beaten\nGeneral,\" Brotteaux would add, \"is necessarily criminal, for in the\nnature of things there must be one in every battle. But there's nothing\nlike condemning a General to death for giving encouragement to others.\"\n\nSeveral had already appeared before the Tribunal; they were all alike,\nthese empty-headed, opinionated soldiers with the brains of a sparrow in\nan ox's skull. This particular commander was pretty nearly as ignorant\nof the sieges and battles of his own campaign as the magistrates who\nwere questioning him; both sides, prosecution and defence, were lost in\na fog of effectives, objectives, munitions and ammunitions, marches and\ncounter-marches. But the mass of citizens listening to these obscure and\nnever-ending details could see behind the half-witted soldier the bare\nand bleeding breast of the fatherland enduring a thousand deaths; and by\nlook and voice urged the jurymen, sitting quietly on their bench, to use\ntheir verdict as a club to fell the foes of the Republic.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste was firmly convinced of one thing,--what they had to strike at\nin the pitiful creature was the two dread monsters that were battening\non the fatherland, revolt and defeat. What a to-do to discover if this\nparticular soldier was innocent or guilty! When La Vend\u00c3\u00a9e was recovering\nheart, when Toulon was surrendering to the enemy, when the army of the\nRhine was recoiling before the victors of Mayence, when the Army of the\nNorth, cowering in C\u00c3\u00a6sar's Camp, might be taken at a blow by the\nImperialists, the English, the Dutch, now masters of Valenciennes, the\none important thing was to teach the Generals of the Republic to conquer\nor to die. To see yonder feeble-witted muddle-pated veteran losing\nhimself under cross-examination among his maps as he had done before in\nthe plains of Northern France, Gamelin longed to yell \"death! death!\"\nwith the rest, and fled from the Hall of Audience to escape the\ntemptation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the meeting of the Section, the newly appointed juryman received the\ncongratulations of the President Olivier, who made him swear on the old\nhigh altar of the Barnabites, now altar of the fatherland, to stifle in\nhis heart, in the sacred name of humanity, every human weakness.\n\nGamelin, with uplifted right hand, invoked as witness of his oath the\naugust shade of Marat, martyr of Liberty, whose bust had lately been set\nup against a pillar of the erstwhile church, facing that of Le Peltier.\n\nThere was some applause, interrupted by cries of protest. The meeting\nwas a stormy one; at the entrance of the nave stood a group of members\nof the Section, armed with pikes and shouting clamorously:\n\n\"It is anti-republican,\" declared the President, \"to carry arms at a\nmeeting of free citizens,\"--and he ordered the muskets and pikes to be\ndeposited there and then in the erstwhile sacristy.\n\nA hunchback, with blazing eyes and lips drawn back so as to show the\nteeth, the _citoyen_ Beauvisage, of the Committee of Vigilance, mounted\nto the pulpit, now become the speakers' tribune and surmounted by a red\ncap of liberty.\n\n\"The Generals are betraying us,\" he vociferated, \"and surrendering our\narmies to the enemy. The Imperialists are pushing forward their cavalry\naround P\u00c3\u00a9ronne and Saint-Quentin. Toulon has been given up to the\nEnglish, who are landing fourteen thousand men there. The foes of the\nRepublic are busy with plots in the very bosom of the Convention. In the\ncapital conspiracies without number are afoot to deliver _the Austrian_.\nAt this very moment while I speak there runs a rumour that the Capet\nbrat has escaped from the Temple and is being borne in triumph to\nSaint-Cloud by those who would fain re-erect the tyrant's throne in his\nfavour. The dearness of food, the depreciation of the _assignats_ are\nthe direct result of manoeuvres carried out in our own homes, beneath\nour very eyes, by the agents of the foreigners. In the name of public\nsafety I call upon the new juryman, our fellow-citizen, to show no pity\nto conspirators and traitors.\"\n\nAs he left the tribune, cries rose among the audience: \"Down with the\nRevolutionary Tribunal! Down with the Moderates!\"\n\nA stout, rosy-faced man, the _citoyen_ Dupont senior, a joiner living in\nthe Place de Thionville, mounted the Tribune, announcing that he wished\nto ask a question of the new juror. Then he demanded of Gamelin what\nattitude he meant to take up in the matter of the Brissotins and of the\nwidow Capet.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste was timid and unpractised in public speaking. But indignation\ngave him eloquence. He rose with a pale face and said in a voice of\nsuppressed emotion:\n\n\"I am a magistrate. I am responsible to my conscience only. Any promise\nI might make you would be against my duty, which is to speak in the\nCourt and hold my peace elsewhere. I have ceased to know you. It is mine\nto give judgment; I know neither friends nor enemies.\"\n\nThe meeting, made up like all meetings of divers elements and subject to\nsudden and incalculable moods, approved these sentiments. But the\n_citoyen_ Dupont returned to the charge; he could not forgive Gamelin\nfor having secured a post he had coveted himself.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said, \"I even approve the juror's scruples. They say\nhe is a patriot; it is for him to examine his conscience and see if it\npermits him to sit on a tribunal intended to destroy the enemies of the\nRepublic and resolved to spare them. There are circumstances in which a\ngood citizen is bound to repudiate all complicity. Is it not averred\nthat more than one juror of this tribunal has let himself be corrupted\nby the gold of the accused, and that the President Montan\u00c3\u00a9 falsified the\nprocedure to save the head of the woman Corday?\"\n\nAt the words the hall resounded with vehement applause. The vaults were\nstill reverberating with the uproar when Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 Trubert mounted the\ntribune. He had grown thinner than ever in the last few months. His face\nwas pale and the cheek-bones seemed ready to pierce the reddened skin;\nhis eyes had a glassy look under the inflamed lids.\n\n\"_Citoyens_,\" he began, in a weak, breathless voice that yet had a\nstrangely penetrating quality, \"we cannot suspect the Revolutionary\nTribunal without at the same time suspecting the Convention and the\nCommittee of Public Safety from which it derives its powers. The\n_citoyen_ Beauvisage has alarmed us, showing us the President Montan\u00c3\u00a9\ntampering with the course of justice in favour of a culprit. Why did he\nnot add, to relieve our fears, that on the denunciation of the Public\nProsecutor, Montan\u00c3\u00a9 has been dismissed his office and thrown into\nprison?... Is it impossible to watch over the public safety without\ncasting suspicion on all and sundry? Is there no talent, no virtue left\nin the Convention? Robespierre, Couthon, Saint-Just, are not these\nhonest men? It is a notable thing that the most violent language is held\nby individuals who have never been known to fight for the Republic. They\ncould speak no otherwise if they wish to render her hateful. _Citoyens_,\nless talk, say I, and more work! It is with shot and shell and not with\nshouting that France will be saved. One-half the cellars of the Section\nhave not been dug up. Not a few citizens still hold considerable\nquantities of bronze. We would remind the rich that patriotic gifts are\nfor them the most potent guarantees. I recommend to your generosity the\nwives and daughters of our soldiers who are covering themselves with\nglory on the frontiers and on the Loire. One of these, the hussar\nPommier (Augustin), formerly a cellarman's lad in the Rue de J\u00c3\u00a9rusalem,\non the 10th of last month, before Cond\u00c3\u00a9, when watering the troop horses,\nwas set upon by six Austrian cavalrymen; he killed two of them and\nbrought in the others prisoners. I ask the Section to declare that\nPommier (Augustin) has done his duty.\"\n\nThis speech was applauded and the Sectionaries dispersed with cries of\n\"Vive la R\u00c3\u00a9publique!\"\n\nLeft alone in the nave with Trubert, Gamelin pressed the latter's hand.\n\n\"Thank you. How are you?\"\n\n\"I? Oh! Very well, very well!\" replied Trubert, coughing and spitting\nblood into his handkerchief. \"The Republic has many enemies without and\nwithin, and our own Section counts a not inconsiderable number of them.\nIt is not with loud talk but with iron and laws that empires are founded\n... good night, Gamelin; I have letters to write.\"\n\nAnd he disappeared, his handkerchief pressed to his lips, into the\nold-time sacristy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe widow Gamelin, her cockade now and henceforth fastened more\ncarefully in her hood, had from one day to the next assumed a fine,\nconsequential air, a Republican haughtiness and the dignified carriage\nsuitable to the mother of a juror of the State.\n\nThe veneration for the law in which she had been brought up, the\nadmiration with which the magistrate's gown and cassock had from a child\ninspired her, the holy terror she had always experienced at sight of\nthose to whom God had delegated on earth His divine right of life and\ndeath, these feelings made her regard as an august and worshipful and\nholy being the son whom till yesterday she had thought of as little more\nthan a child. To her simple mind the conviction of the continuity of\njustice through all the changes of the Revolution was as strong as was\nthat of the legislators of the Convention regarding the continuity of\nthe State under varying systems of government, and the Revolutionary\nTribunal appeared to her every whit as majestic as any of the\ntime-honoured jurisdictions she had been taught to revere.\n\nThe _citoyen_ Brotteaux showed the young magistrate an interest mingled\nwith surprise and a reluctant deference. His views were the same as the\nwidow Gamelin's as to the continuity of justice under successive\ngovernments; but, in flat contradiction to that good lady's attitude,\nhis scorn for the Revolutionary Tribunals was on a par with his contempt\nfor the courts of the ancien r\u00c3\u00a9gime. Not daring to express his opinions\nopenly and unable to make up his mind to say nothing, he indulged in a\nstring of paradoxes which Gamelin understood just well enough to suspect\nthe anti-patriotism that underlay them.\n\n\"The august tribunal whereon you are soon to take your seat,\" he told\nhim on one occasion, \"was instituted by the French Senate for the\nsecurity of the Republic; and it was for certain a magnanimous thought\non the part of our legislators to set up a court to try our enemies. I\nappreciate its generosity, but I doubt its wisdom. It would have shown\ngreater astuteness, it seems to me, if they had struck down in the dark\nthe more irreconcilable of their adversaries and won over the rest by\ngifts and promises. A tribunal strikes slowly and effects more harm than\nit inspires fear; its first duty is to make an example. The mischief\nyours does is to unite together all whom it terrifies and make out of a\nmass of contradictory interests and passions a great party capable of\ncommon and effective action. You sow fear broadcast, and it is terror\nmore than courage that produces heroes; I pray, _citoyen_, you may not\none day see prodigies of terror arrayed against you!\"\n\nThe engraver Desmahis, in love that week with a light o' love of the\nPalais-\u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9 named Flora, a brown-locked giantess, had nevertheless\nfound five minutes to congratulate his comrade and tell him that such an\nappointment was a great compliment to the fine arts.\n\n\u00c3\u0089lodie herself, though without knowing it she detested everything\nrevolutionary and who dreaded official functions as the most dangerous\nof rivals, the most likely to estrange her lover's affections, the\ntender \u00c3\u0089lodie was impressed by the glamour attaching to a magistrate\ncalled upon to pronounce judgment in matters of life and death. Besides\nwhich, \u00c3\u0089variste's promotion as a juryman was followed by other fortunate\nresults that filled her loving heart with satisfaction; the _citoyen_\nJean Blaise made a point of calling at the studio in the Place de\nThionville and embraced the young juror affectionately in a burst of\nmanly sympathy.\n\nLike all the anti-revolutionaries, he had a great respect for the\nauthorities established by the Republic, and ever since he had been\ndenounced for fraud in connection with his supplies for the army, the\nRevolutionary Tribunal had inspired him with a wholesome dread. He felt\nhimself to be a person too much in the public eye and mixed up in too\nmany transactions to enjoy perfect security; so the _citoyen_ Gamelin\nstruck him as a friend worth cultivating. When all was said, one was a\ngood citizen and on the side of justice.\n\nHe gave the painter magistrate his hand, declaring himself his true\nfriend and a true patriot, a well-wisher of the arts and of liberty.\nGamelin forgot his injuries and pressed the hand so generously offered.\n\n\"_Citoyen_ \u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin,\" said Jean Blaise, \"I appeal to you as a\nfriend and as a man of talent. I am going to take you to-morrow for two\ndays' jaunt in the country; you can do some drawing and we can enjoy a\ntalk.\"\n\nSeveral times every year the print-dealer was in the habit of making a\ntwo or three days' expedition of this sort in the company of artists who\nmade drawings, according to his suggestions, of landscapes and ruins. He\nwas quick to see what would please the public and these little journeys\nalways resulted in some picturesque bits which were then finished at\nhome and cleverly engraved; prints in red or colours were struck off\nfrom these, and brought in a good profit to the _citoyen_ Blaise. From\nthe same sketches he had over-doors and panels executed, which sold as\nwell or better than the decorative works of Hubert Robert.\n\nOn this occasion he had invited the _citoyen_ Gamelin to accompany him\nto sketch buildings after nature, so much had the juror's office\nincreased the painter's importance in his eyes. Two other artists were\nof the party, the engraver Desmahis, who drew well, and an almost\nunknown man, Philippe Dubois, an excellent designer in the style of\nRobert. According to custom, the _citoyenne_ \u00c3\u0089lodie with her friend the\n_citoyenne_ Hasard accompanied the artists. Jean Blaise, an adept at\ncombining pleasure with profit, had also extended an invitation to the\n_citoyenne_ Th\u00c3\u00a9venin, an actress at the Vaudeville, who was reputed to\nbe on the best of terms with him.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nOn Saturday at seven in the morning the _citoyen_ Blaise, in a black\ncocked-hat, scarlet waistcoat, doe-skin breeches, and boots with yellow\ntops, rapped with the handle of his riding-whip at the studio door. The\n_citoyenne_ Gamelin was in the room in polite conversation with the\n_citoyen_ Brotteaux, while \u00c3\u0089variste stood before a bit of looking-glass\nknotting his high white cravat.\n\n\"A pleasant journey, Monsieur Blaise!\" the _citoyenne_ greeted him.\n\"But, as you are going to paint landscapes, why don't you take Monsieur\nBrotteaux, who is a painter?\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Jean Blaise, \"will you come with us, _citoyen_\nBrotteaux?\"\n\nOn being assured he would not be intruding, Brotteaux, a man of a\nsociable temper and fond of all amusements, accepted the invitation.\n\nThe _citoyenne_ \u00c3\u0089lodie had climbed the four storeys to embrace the widow\nGamelin, whom she called her good mother. She was in white from head to\nfoot, and smelt of lavender.\n\nAn old two-horsed travelling _berline_ stood waiting in the Place, with\nthe hood down. Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin occupied the back seat with Julienne\nHasard. \u00c3\u0089lodie made the actress sit on the right, took the left-hand\nplace herself and put the slim Julienne between the two of them.\nBrotteaux settled himself, back to the horses, facing the _citoyenne_\nTh\u00c3\u00a9venin; Philippe Dubois, opposite the _citoyenne_ Hasard; \u00c3\u0089variste\nopposite \u00c3\u0089lodie. As for Philippe Desmahis, he planted his athletic\nfigure on the box, on the coachman's left, and proceeded to amaze that\nworthy with a traveller's tale about a country in America where the\ntrees bore chitterlings and saveloys by way of fruit.\n\nThe _citoyen_ Blaise, who was a capital rider, took the road on\nhorseback, going on in front to escape the dust from the _berline_.\n\nAs the wheels rattled merrily over the suburban roads the travellers\nbegan to forget their cares, and at sight of the green fields and trees\nand sky, their minds turned to gay and pleasant thoughts. \u00c3\u0089lodie dreamed\nshe was surely born to rear poultry with \u00c3\u0089variste, a country justice, to\nhelp her, in some village on a river bank beside a wood. The roadside\nelms whirled by as they sped along. Outside the villages the peasants'\nmastiffs dashed out to intercept the carriage and barked at the horses,\nwhile a fat spaniel, lying in the roadway, struggled reluctantly to its\nfeet; the fowls scattered and fled; the geese in a close-packed band\nwaddled slowly out of the way. The children, with their fresh morning\nfaces, watched the company go by. It was a hot day and a cloudless sky.\nThe parched earth was thirsting for rain. They alighted just outside\nVillejuif. On their way through the little town, Desmahis went into a\nfruiterer's to buy cherries for the overheated _citoyennes_. The\nshop-keeper was a pretty woman, and Desmahis showed no signs of\nreappearing. Philippe Dubois shouted to him, using the nickname his\nfriends constantly gave him:\n\n\"Ho there! Barbaroux!... Barbaroux!\"\n\nAt this hated name the passers-by pricked up their ears and faces\nappeared at every window. Then, when they saw a young and handsome man\nemerge from the shop, his jacket thrown open, his neckerchief flying\nloose over a muscular chest, and carrying over his shoulder a basket of\ncherries and his coat at the end of a stick, taking him for the\nproscribed girondist, a posse of _sansculottes_ laid violent hands on\nhim. Regardless of his indignant protests, they would have haled him to\nthe town-hall, had not old Brotteaux, Gamelin, and the three young women\nborne testimony that the _citoyen_ was named Philippe Desmahis, a\ncopper-plate engraver and a good Jacobin. Even then the suspect had to\nshow his _carte de civisme_, which he had in his pocket by great good\nluck, for he was very heedless in such matters. At this price he escaped\nfrom the hands of these patriotic villagers without worse loss than one\nof his lace ruffles, which had been torn off; but this was a trifle\nafter all. He even received the apologies of the National Guards who had\nhustled him the most savagely and who now spoke of carrying him in\ntriumph to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville.\n\nA free man again and with the _citoyennes_ \u00c3\u0089lodie, Rose, and Julienne\ncrowding round him, Desmahis looked at Philippe Dubois--he did not like\nthe man and suspected him of having played him a practical joke--with a\nwry smile, and towering above him by a whole head:\n\n\"Dubois,\" he told him, \"if you call me Barbaroux again, I shall call you\nBrissot; he is a little fat man with a silly face, greasy hair, an oily\nskin and damp hands. They'll be perfectly sure you are the infamous\nBrissot, the people's enemy; and the good Republicans, filled with\nhorror and loathing at sight of you, will hang you from the nearest\nlamp-post. You hear me?\"\n\nThe _citoyen_ Blaise, who had been watering his horse, announced that he\nhad arranged the affair, though it was quite plain to everybody that it\nhad been arranged without him.\n\nThe company got in again, and as they drove on, Desmahis informed the\ncoachman that in this same plain of Longjumeau several inhabitants of\nthe Moon had once come down, in shape and colour much like frogs, only\nvery much bigger. Philippe Dubois and Gamelin talked about their art.\nDubois, a pupil of Regnault, had been to Rome, where he had seen\nRaphael's tapestries, which he set above all the masterpieces of the\nworld. He admired Correggio's colouring, Annibale Caracci's invention,\nDomenichino's drawing, but thought nothing comparable in point of style\nwith the pictures of Pompeio Battoni. He had been in touch at Rome with\nMonsieur M\u00c3\u00a9nageot and Madame Lebrun, who had both pronounced against the\nRevolution; so the less said of them the better. But he spoke highly of\nAngelica Kauffmann, who had a pure taste and a fine knowledge of the\nAntique.\n\nGamelin deplored that the apogee of French painting, belated as it was,\nfor it only dated from Lesueur, Claude and Poussin and corresponded with\nthe decadence of the Italian and Flemish schools, had been succeeded by\nso rapid and profound a decline. This he attributed to the degraded\nstate of manners and to the Academy, which was the expression of that\nstate. But the Academy had been happily abolished, and under the\ninfluence of new canons, David and his school were creating an art\nworthy of a free people. Among the young painters, Gamelin, without a\ntrace of envy, gave the first place to Hennequin and Topino-Lebrun.\nPhilippe Dubois preferred his own master Regnault to David, and founded\nhis hopes for the future of painting on that rising artist G\u00c3\u00a9rard.\n\nMeantime \u00c3\u0089lodie complimented the _citoyenne_ Th\u00c3\u00a9venin on her red velvet\ntoque and white gown. The actress repaid the compliment by\ncongratulating her two companions on their toilets and advising them how\nto do better still; the thing, she said, was to be more sparing in\nornaments and trimmings.\n\n\"A woman can never be dressed too simply,\" was her dictum. \"We see this\non the stage, where the costume should allow every pose to be\nappreciated. That is its true beauty and it needs no other.\"\n\n\"You are right, my dear,\" replied \u00c3\u0089lodie. \"Only there is nothing more\nexpensive in dress than simplicity. It is not always out of bad taste we\nadd frills and furbelows; sometimes it is to save our pockets.\"\n\nThey discussed eagerly the autumn fashions,--frocks entirely plain and\nshort-waisted.\n\n\"So many women disfigure themselves through following the fashion!\"\ndeclared Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin. \"In dressing every woman should study her own\nfigure.\"\n\n\"There is nothing beautiful save draperies that follow the lines of the\nfigure and fall in folds,\" put in Gamelin. \"Everything that is cut out\nand sewn is hideous.\"\n\nThese sentiments, more appropriate in a treatise of Winckelmann's than\nin the mouth of a man talking to Parisiennes, met with the scorn they\ndeserved, being entirely disregarded.\n\n\"For the winter,\" observed \u00c3\u0089lodie, \"they are making quilted gowns in\nLapland style of taffeta and muslin, and coats _\u00c3\u00a0 la Zulime_,\nround-waisted and opening over a stomacher _\u00c3\u00a0 la Turque_.\"\n\n\"Nasty cheap things,\" declared the actress, \"you can buy them ready\nmade. Now I have a little seamstress who works like an angel and is not\ndear; I'll send her to see you, my dear.\"\n\nSo they prattled on trippingly, eagerly discussing and appraising\ndifferent fine fabrics--striped taffeta, self-coloured china silk,\nmuslin, gauze, nankeen.\n\nAnd old Brotteaux, as he listened to them, thought with a pensive\npleasure of these veils that hide women's charms and change\nincessantly,--how they last for a few years to be renewed eternally like\nthe flowers of the field. And his eyes, as they wandered from the three\npretty women to the cornflowers and the poppies in the wheat, were wet\nwith smiling tears.\n\nThey reached Orangis about nine o'clock and stopped before the inn, the\n_Auberge de la Cloche_, where the Poitrines, husband and wife, offered\naccommodation for man and beast. The _citoyen_ Blaise, who had repaired\nany disorder in his dress, helped the _citoyennes_ to alight. After\nordering dinner for midday, they all set off, preceded by their\npaintboxes, drawing-boards, easels, and parasols, which were carried by\na village lad, for the meadows near the confluence of the Orge and the\nYvette, a charming bit of country giving a view over the verdant plain\nof Longjumeau and bounded by the Seine and the woods of\nSainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve.\n\nJean Blaise, the leader of the troop of artists, was bandying funny\nstories with the _ci-devant_ financier, tales that brought in without\nrhyme or reason Verboquet the Open-handed, Catherine Cuissot the pedlar,\nthe demoiselles Chaudron, the fortune-teller Galichet, as well as\ncharacters of a later time like Cadet-Rousselle and Madame Angot.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste, inspired with a sudden love of nature, as he saw a troop of\nharvesters binding their sheaves, felt the tears rise to his eyes, while\nvisions of concord and affection filled his heart. For his part,\nDesmahis was blowing the light down of the seeding dandelions into the\n_citoyennes'_ hair. All three loved posies, as town-bred girls always\ndo, and were busy in the meadows plucking the mullein, whose blossoms\ngrow in spikes close round the stem, the campanula, with its little\nblue-bells hanging in rows one above another, the slender twigs of the\nscented vervain, wallwort, mint, dyer's weed, milfoil--all the wild\nflowers of late summer. Jean-Jacques had made botany the fashion among\ntownswomen, so all three knew the name and symbolism of every flower. As\nthe delicate petals, drooping for want of moisture, wilted in her hands\nand fell in a shower about her feet, the _citoyenne_ \u00c3\u0089lodie sighed:\n\n\"They are dying already, the poor flowers!\"\n\nAll set to work and strove to express nature as they saw her; but each\nsaw her through the eyes of a master. In a short time Philippe Dubois\nhad knocked off in the style of Hubert Robert a deserted farm, a clump\nof storm-riven trees, a dried-up torrent. \u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin found a\nlandscape by Poussin ready made on the banks of the Yvette. Philippe\nDesmahis was at work before a pigeon-cote in the picaresque manner of\nCallot and Duplessis. Old Brotteaux who piqued himself on imitating the\nFlemings, was drawing a cow with infinite care. \u00c3\u0089lodie was sketching a\npeasant's hut, while her friend Julienne, who was a colourman's\ndaughter, set her palette. A swarm of children pressed about her,\nwatching her paint, whom she would scold out of her light at intervals,\ncalling them pestering gnats and giving them lollipops. The _citoyenne_\nTh\u00c3\u00a9venin, picking out the pretty ones, would wash their faces, kiss them\nand put flowers in their hair. She fondled them with a gentle air of\nmelancholy, because she had missed the joy of motherhood,--as well as to\nheighten her fascinations by a show of tender sentiment and to practise\nherself in the art of pose and grouping.\n\nShe was the only member of the party neither drawing nor painting. She\ndevoted her attention to learning a part and still more to charming her\ncompanions, flitting from one to another, book in hand, a bright,\nentrancing creature.\n\n\"No complexion, no figure, no voice, no nothing,\" declared the\nwomen,--and she filled the earth with movement, colour and harmony.\nFaded, pretty, tired, indefatigable, she was the joy of the expedition.\nA woman of ever-varying moods, but always gay, sensitive, quick-tempered\nand yet easy-going and accommodating, a sharp tongue with the most\npolished utterance, vain, modest, true, false, delightful; if Rose\nTh\u00c3\u00a9venin enjoyed no triumphant success, if she was not worshipped as a\ngoddess, it was because the times were out of joint and Paris had no\nmore incense, no more altars for the Graces. The _citoyenne_ Blaise\nherself, who made a face when she spoke of her and used to call her \"my\nstep-mother,\" could not see her and not be subjugated by such an array\nof charms.\n\nThey were rehearsing _Les Visitandines_ at the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Feydeau, and Rose\nwas full of self-congratulation at having a part full of \"naturalness.\"\nIt was this quality she strove after, this she sought and this she\nfound.\n\n\"Then we shall not see 'Pam\u00c3\u00a9la'?\" asked Desmahis.\n\nThe Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre de la Nation was closed and the actors packed off to the\nMadelonnettes and to P\u00c3\u00a9lagie.\n\n\"Do you call that liberty?\" cried Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin, raising her beautiful\neyes to heaven in indignant protest.\n\n\"The players of the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre de la Nation are aristocrats, and the\n_citoyen_ Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois' piece tends to make men regret the privileges of the\nnoblesse.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin, \"have you patience to listen only to\nthose who flatter you?\"\n\nAs midday approached everybody began to feel pangs of hunger and the\nlittle band marched back to the inn.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste walked beside \u00c3\u0089lodie, smilingly recalling memories of their\nfirst meetings:\n\n\"Two young birds had fallen out of their nests on the roof on to the\nsill of your window. You brought the little creatures up by hand; one of\nthem lived and in due time flew away. The other died in the nest of\ncotton-wool you had made him. 'It was the one I loved best,' I remember\nyou said. That day, \u00c3\u0089lodie, you were wearing a red bow in your hair.\"\n\nPhilippe Dubois and Brotteaux, a little behind the rest, were talking of\nRome, where they had both been, the latter in '72, the other towards the\nlast days of the Academy. Brotteaux indeed had never forgotten the\nPrincess Mondragone, to whom he would most certainly have poured out\nhis plaints but for the Count Altieri, who always followed her like her\nshadow. Nor did Philippe Dubois fail to mention that he had been invited\nto dine with Cardinal de Bernis and that he was the most obliging host\nin the world.\n\n\"I knew him,\" said Brotteaux, \"and I may add without boasting that I was\nfor some while one of his most intimate friends; he had a taste for low\nsociety. He was an amiable man, and for all his affectation of telling\nfairy tales, there was more sound philosophy in his little finger than\nin the heads of all you Jacobins, who are for making us virtuous and\nGod-fearing by Act of Parliament. Upon my word I prefer our\nsimple-minded theophagists who know not what they say nor yet what they\ndo, to these mad law-menders, who make it their business to guillotine\nus in order to render us wise and virtuous and adorers of the Supreme\nBeing who has created them in His likeness. In former days I used to\nhave Mass said in the Chapel at Les Ilettes by a poor devil of a Cur\u00c3\u00a9\nwho used to say in his cups: 'Don't let's speak ill of sinners; we live\nby 'em, we priests, unworthy as we are!' You must agree, sir, this\nprayer-monger held sound maxims of government. We should adopt his\nprinciples, and govern men as being what they are and not what we should\nlike them to be.\"\n\nRose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin had meantime drawn closer to the old man. She knew he had\nlived on a grand scale, and the thought of this gilded the _ci-devant_\nfinancier's present poverty, which she deemed less humiliating as being\ndue to general causes, the result of the public bankruptcy. She saw in\nhim, with curiosity not unmixed with respect, the survival of one of\nthose open-handed millionaires of whom her elder comrades of the stage\nspoke with sighs of unfeigned regret. Besides, the old fellow in his\nplum-coloured coat, so threadbare and so well brushed, pleased her by\nhis agreeable address.\n\n\"Monsieur Brotteaux,\" she said to him, \"we know how once upon a time, in\na noble park, on moonlight nights, you would slip into the shade of\nmyrtle groves with actresses and dancing-girls to the far-off shrilling\nof flutes and fiddles.... Alas! they were more lovely, were they not,\nyour goddesses of the Opera and the Com\u00c3\u00a9die-Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise, than we of\nto-day, we poor little National actresses?\"\n\n\"Never think it, Mademoiselle,\" returned Brotteaux, \"but believe me, if\none like you had been known in those days, she would have moved alone,\nas sovereign queen without a rival (little as she would have desired\nsuch solitude), in the park you are obliging enough to form so\nflattering a picture of....\"\n\nIt was quite a rustic inn, this H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Cloche. A branch of holly\nhung over the great waggon doors that opened on a courtyard where fowls\nwere always pecking about in the damp soil. On the far side of this\nstood the house itself, consisting of a ground floor and one storey\nabove, crowned by a high-pitched tiled roof and with walls almost hidden\nunder old climbing rose-trees covered with blossom. To the right,\ntrimmed fruit-trees showed their tops above the low garden wall. To the\nleft was the stable, with an outside manger and a barn supported by\nwooden pillars. A ladder leaned against the wall. Here again, under a\nshed crowded with agricultural implements and stumps of trees, a white\ncock was keeping an eye on his hens from the top of a broken-down\ncabriolet. The courtyard was enclosed on this side by cow-sheds, in\nfront of which rose in mountainous grandeur a dunghill which at this\nmoment a girl as broad as she was long, with straw-coloured hair, was\nturning over with a pitchfork. The liquid manure filled her sabots and\nbathed her bare feet, and you could see the heels rise out of her shoes\nevery now and then as yellow as saffron. Her petticoats were kilted and\nrevealed the filth on her enormous calves and thick ankles. While\nPhilippe Desmahis was staring at her, surprised and tickled by the\nwhimsicalities of nature in framing this odd example of breadth without\nlength, the landlord shouted:\n\n\"Ho, there! Tronche, my girl! go fetch some water!\"\n\nShe turned her head, showing a scarlet face and a vast mouth in which\none huge front tooth was missing. It had needed nothing less than a\nbull's horn to effect a breach in that powerful jaw. She stood there\ngrinning, pitchfork on shoulder. Her sleeves were rolled up and her\narms, as thick as another woman's thighs, gleamed in the sun.\n\nThe table was laid in the farm kitchen, where a brace of fowls was\nroasting,--they were almost done to a turn,--under the hood of the open\nfireplace, above which hung two or three old fowling-pieces by way of\nornament. The bare whitewashed room, twenty feet long, was lighted only\nthrough the panes of greenish glass let into the door and by a single\nwindow, framed in roses, near which the grandmother sat turning her\nspinning-wheel. She wore a coif and a lace frilling in the fashion of\nthe Regency. Her gnarled, earth-stained fingers held the distaff. Flies\nclustered about her lids without her trying to drive them away. As a\nchild in her mother's arms, she had seen Louis XIV go by in his coach.\n\nSixty years ago she had made the journey to Paris. In a weak sing-song\nvoice she told the tale to the three young women, standing in front of\nher, how she had seen the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville, the Tuileries and the\nSamaritaine, and how, when she was crossing the Pont-Royal, a barge\nloaded with apples for the March\u00c3\u00a9 du Mail had broken up, the apples had\nfloated down the current and the river was all red with the rosy-cheeked\nfruit.\n\nShe had been told of the changes that had occurred of late in the\nkingdom, and in particular of the coil there was betwixt the cur\u00c3\u00a9s who\nhad taken the oath and the nonjuring cur\u00c3\u00a9s. She knew likewise there had\nbeen wars and famines and portents in the sky. She did not believe the\nKing was dead. They had contrived his escape, she _would_ have it, by a\nsubterranean passage, and had handed over to the headsman in his stead a\nman of the common people.\n\nAt the old woman's feet, in his wicker cradle, Jeannot, the last born of\nthe Poitrines, was cutting his teeth. The _citoyenne_ Th\u00c3\u00a9venin lifted\nthe cradle and smiled at the child, which moaned feebly, worn out with\nfeverishness and convulsions. It must have been very ill, for they had\nsent for the doctor, the _citoyen_ Pelleport, who, it is true, being a\ndeputy-substitute to the Convention, asked no payment for his visits.\n\nThe _citoyenne_ Th\u00c3\u00a9venin, an innkeeper's daughter herself, was in her\nelement; not satisfied with the way the farm-girl had washed the plates\nand dishes, she gave an extra wipe to the crockery and glass, an extra\npolish to the knives and forks. While the _citoyenne_ Poitrine was\nattending to the soup, which she tasted from time to time as a good cook\nshould, \u00c3\u0089lodie was cutting up into slices a four-pound loaf hot from the\noven. Gamelin, when he saw what she was doing, addressed her:\n\n\"A few days ago I read a book written by a young German whose name I\nhave forgotten, and which has been very well translated into French. In\nit you have a beautiful young girl named Charlotte, who, like you,\n\u00c3\u0089lodie, was cutting bread and butter, and like you, cutting it\ngracefully, and so prettily that at the sight the young Werther fell in\nlove with her.\"\n\n\"And it ended in their marrying?\" asked \u00c3\u0089lodie.\n\n\"No,\" replied \u00c3\u0089variste; \"it ended in Werther's death by violence.\"\n\nThey dined well, they were all very hungry; but the fare was\nindifferent. Jean Blaise complained bitterly; he was a great trencherman\nand made it a rule of conduct to feed well; and no doubt what urged him\nto elaborate his gluttony into a system was the general scarcity. In\nevery household the Revolution had overturned the cooking pot. The\ncommon run of citizens had nothing to chew upon. Clever folks like Jean\nBlaise, who made big profits amid the general wretchedness, went to the\ncookshop where they showed their astuteness by stuffing themselves to\nrepletion. As for Brotteaux who, in this year II of liberty, was living\non chestnuts and bread-crusts, he could remember having supped at Grimod\nde la Reyni\u00c3\u00a8re's at the near end of the Champs \u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es. Eager to win the\nrepute of an accomplished gourmand he reeled off, sitting there before\nDame Poitrine's bacon and cabbages, a string of artful kitchen recipes\nand wise gastronomic maxims. Presently, when Gamelin protested that a\nRepublican scorns the pleasures of the table, the old financier, always\na lover of antiquity, gave the young Spartan the true recipe for the\nfamous black broth.\n\nAfter dinner, Jean Blaise, who never forgot business, set his itinerant\nacademy to make studies and sketches of the inn, which struck him as\nquite romantic in its dilapidation. While Philippe Desmahis and Philippe\nDubois were drawing the cow-houses the girl Tronche came out to feed the\npigs. The _citoyen_ Pelleport, officer of health, who at the same moment\nappeared at the door of the farm kitchen where he had been bestowing his\nprofessional services on the Poitrine baby, stepped up to the artists\nand after complimenting them on their talents, which were an honour to\nthe whole nation, pointed to the Tronche girl in the middle of her\nporkers:\n\n\"You see that creature,\" he said, \"it is not one girl, it is two girls.\nI speak by the letter, understand that. I was amazed at the\nextraordinary massiveness of her bony framework and I examined her, to\ndiscover she had most of the bones in duplicate--in each thigh two\nfemurs welded together, in each shoulder a double humerus. Some of her\nmuscles are likewise in duplicate. It is a case, in my view, of a pair\nof twins associated or rather confounded together. It is an interesting\nphenomenon. I notified Monsieur Saint-Hilaire of the facts, and he\nthanked me. It is a monster you see before you, _citoyens_. The people\nhere call her 'the girl Tronche'; they should say 'the girls Tronches,'\nfor there are two of them. Nature has these freaks.... Good evening,\n_citoyens_; we shall have a storm to-night....\"\n\nAfter supper by candle-light, the Academy Blaise adjourned to the\ncourtyard where they were joined by a son and daughter of the house in\na game of blindman's-buff, in which the young folks, both men and women,\ndisplayed a feverish energy sufficiently accounted for by the high\nspirits proper to their age without seeking an explanation in the wild\nand precarious times in which they lived. When it was quite dark, Jean\nBlaise proposed children's games in the farm kitchen. \u00c3\u0089lodie suggested\nthe game of \"hunt my heart,\" and this was agreed to unanimously. Under\nthe girl's direction Philippe Desmahis traced in chalk, on different\npieces of furniture, on doors and walls, seven hearts, that is to say\none less than there were players, for old Brotteaux had obligingly\njoined the rest. They danced round in a ring singing \"La Tour, prends\ngarde!\" and at a signal from \u00c3\u0089lodie, each ran to put a hand on a heart.\nGamelin in his absent-minded clumsiness was too late to find one vacant,\nand had to pay a forfeit, the little knife he had bought for six sous at\nthe fair of Saint-Germain and with which he had cut the loaf for his\nmother in her poverty. The game went on, and one after the other Blaise,\n\u00c3\u0089lodie, Brotteaux and Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin failed to touch a heart; each paid a\nforfeit in turn--a ring, a reticule, a little morocco-bound book, a\nbracelet. Then the forfeits were raffled on \u00c3\u0089lodie's lap, and each\nplayer had to redeem his property by showing his society\naccomplishments--singing a song or reciting a poem. Brotteaux chose the\nspeech of the patron saint of France in the first canto of the\n_Pucelle_:\n\n    \"Je suis Denis et saint de mon m\u00c3\u00a9tier,\n    J'aime la Gaule,...\"[2]\n\n\nThe _citoyen_ Blaise, though a far less well-read man, replied without\nhesitation with Richemond's ripost:\n\n    \"Monsieur le Saint, ce n'\u00c3\u00a9tait pas la peine\n    D'abandonner le c\u00c3\u00a9leste domaine....\"[3]\n\n\nAt that time everybody was reading and re-reading with delight the\nmasterpiece of the French Ariosto; the most serious of men smiled over\nthe loves of Jeanne and Dunois, the adventures of Agn\u00c3\u00a8s and Monrose and\nthe exploits of the winged ass. Every man of cultivation knew by heart\nthe choice passages of this diverting and philosophical poem. \u00c3\u0089variste\nGamelin himself, stern-tempered as he was, when he recovered his\ntwopenny knife from \u00c3\u0089lodie's lap, recited the going down of Grisbourdon\ninto hell, with a good deal of spirit. The _citoyenne_ Th\u00c3\u00a9venin sang\nwithout accompaniment Nina's ballad:\n\n\"_Quand le bien-aim\u00c3\u00a9 reviendra._\"\n\nDesmahis sang to the tune of _La Faridondaine_:\n\n    \"Quelques-uns prirent le cochon\n      De ce bon saint Antoine,\n    Et lui mettant un capuchon,\n      Ils en firent un moine.\n    Il n'en co\u00c3\u00bbtait que la fa\u00c3\u00a7on....\"[4]\n\nAll the same Desmahis was in a pensive mood. For the moment he was\nardently in love with all the three women with whom he was playing\nforfeits, and was casting burning looks of soft appeal at each in turn.\nHe loved Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin for her grace, her supple figure, her clever\nacting, her roving glances, and her voice that went straight to a man's\nheart; he loved \u00c3\u0089lodie, because he recognized instinctively her rich\nendowment of temperament and her kind, complaisant humour; he loved\nJulienne Hasard, despite her colourless hair, her pale eyelashes, her\nfreckles and her thin bust, because, like Dunois in Voltaire's\n_Pucelle_, he was always ready, in his generosity, to give the least\nengaging a token of love--and the more so in this instance because she\nappeared to be for the moment the most neglected, and therefore the most\namenable to his attentions. Without a trace of vanity, he was never sure\nof these being agreeable; nor yet was he ever sure of their not being.\nSo he never omitted to offer them on the chance. Taking advantage of the\nopportunities offered by the game of forfeits, he made some tender\nspeeches to Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin, who showed no displeasure, but could hardly\nsay much in return under the jealous eyes of the _citoyen_ Jean Blaise.\nHe spoke more warmly still to the _citoyenne_ \u00c3\u0089lodie, whom he knew to be\npledged to Gamelin, but he was not so exacting as to want a heart all to\nhimself. \u00c3\u0089lodie could never care for him; but she thought him a handsome\nfellow and did not altogether succeed in hiding the fact from him.\nFinally, he whispered his most ardent vows in the ear of the _citoyenne_\nHasard, which she received with an air of bewildered stupefaction that\nmight equally express abject submission or chill indifference. And\nDesmahis did not believe she was indifferent to him.\n\nThe inn contained only two bedrooms, both on the first floor and opening\non the same landing. That to the left, the better of the two, boasted a\nflowered paper and a looking-glass the size of a man's hand, the gilt\nframe of which had been blackened by generations of flies since the days\nwhen Louis XIV was a child. In it, under sprigged muslin curtains, stood\ntwo beds with down pillows, coverlets and counterpanes. This room was\nreserved for the three _citoyennes_.\n\nWhen the time came to retire, Desmahis and the _citoyenne_ Hasard, each\nholding a bedroom candlestick, wished each other good-night on the\nlanding. The amorous engraver quickly passed a note to the colourman's\ndaughter, beseeching her to come to him, when everybody was asleep, in\nthe garret, which was over the _citoyennes'_ chamber.\n\nWith judicious foresight, he had taken care in the course of the day to\nstudy the lie of the land and explore the garret in question, which was\nfull of strings of onions, apples and pears left there to ripen with a\nswarm of wasps crawling over them, chests and old trunks. He had even\nnoticed an old bed of sacking, decrepit and now disused, as far as he\ncould see, and a palliasse, all ripped up and jumping with fleas.\n\nFacing the _citoyennes'_ room was another of very modest dimensions\ncontaining three beds, where the men of the party were to sleep, in such\ncomfort as they might. But Brotteaux, who was a Sybarite, betook himself\nto the barn to sleep among the hay. As for Jean Blaise, _he_ had\ndisappeared. Dubois and Gamelin were soon asleep. Desmahis went to bed;\nbut no sooner had the silence of night, like a stagnant pool, enveloped\nthe house, than the engraver got up and climbed the wooden staircase,\nwhich creaked under his bare feet. The door of the garret stood ajar.\nFrom within came a breath of stifling hot air, mingled with the acrid\nsmell of rotting fruit. On the broken-down bed of sacking lay the girl\nTronche, fast asleep with her mouth open.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n       *       *       *       *       *\n       *       *       *       *       *\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDesmahis returned to his room, where he slept soundly and peacefully\ntill daybreak.\n\nOn the morrow, after a last day's work, the itinerant Academy took the\nroad back to Paris. When Jean Blaise paid mine host in assignats, the\n_citoyen_ Poitrine complained bitterly that he never saw what he called\n\"square money\" nowadays, and promised a fine candle to the beggar who'd\nbring back the \"yellow boys\" again.\n\nHe offered the _citoyennes_ their pick of flowers. At his orders, the\ngirl Tronche mounted on a ladder in her sabots and kilted skirts, giving\na full view of her noble, much-bespattered calves, and was indefatigable\nin cutting blossoms from the climbing roses that covered the wall. From\nher huge hands the flowers fell in showers, in torrents, in avalanches,\ninto the laps of \u00c3\u0089lodie, Julienne, and Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin, who held out their\nskirts to catch them. The carriage was full of them. The whole party,\nwhen they got back at nightfall, carried armfuls home, and their\nsleeping and waking were perfumed with their fragrance.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[2]\n\n    \"I am Denis, and sainthood is my trade,\n    I love the land of Gaul,... etc.\"\n\n\n\n[3]\n\n    \"Well, well, sir Saint, 'twas hardly worth your pains\n    Thus to forsake the heavenly domains....\"\n\n\n\n[4]\n\n    \"Some ribalds took the pig,\n      Of the good St. Anthony,\n    And clapping a cowl on's head,\n      They made the brute a monk.\n    'Twas all a matter of dress....\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nIn the forenoon of the 7th September the _citoyenne_ Rochemaure, on her\nway to visit Gamelin, the new juror, whose interest she wished to\nsolicit on behalf of an acquaintance, who had been denounced as a\nsuspect, encountered on the landing the _ci-devant_ Brotteaux des\nIlettes, who had been her lover in the old happy days. Brotteaux was\njust starting to deliver a gross of dancing-dolls of his manufacture to\nthe toy-merchant in the Rue de la Loi; for their more convenient\ncarriage he had hit on the idea of tying them at the end of a pole, as\nthe street hawkers do with their commodities. His manners were always\nchivalrous towards women, even to those whose fascination for him had\nbeen blunted by long familiarity, as could hardly fail to be the case\nwith Madame de Rochemaure,--unless indeed he found her appetizing with\nthe added seasoning of betrayal, absence, unfaithfulness and fat. Be\nthis as it may, he now greeted her on the sordid stairs with their\ncracked tiles as courteously as he had ever done on the steps before the\nentrance-door of Les Ilettes, and begged her to do him the honour of\nentering his garret. She climbed the ladder nimbly enough and found\nherself under a timbering, the sloping beams of which supported a tiled\nroof pierced with a skylight. It was impossible to stand upright. She\nsat down on the only chair there was in the wretched place; after a\nbrief glance at the broken tiling, she asked in a tone of surprise and\nsorrow:\n\n\"Is this where you live, Maurice? You need have little fear of\nintruders. One must be an imp or a cat to find you here.\"\n\n\"I am cramped for space,\" returned the _ci-devant_ millionaire; \"and I\ndo not deny the fact that sometimes it rains on my pallet. It is a\ntrifling inconvenience. And on fine nights I can see the moon, symbol\nand confidant of men's loves. For the moon, Madame, since the world\nbegan, has been apostrophized by lovers, and at her full, with her pale\nround face, she recalls to the fond swain's mind the object of his\ndesires.\"\n\n\"I know,\" sighed the _citoyenne_.\n\n\"When their time comes the cats make a fine pandemonium in the rain\ngutter yonder. But we must forgive love if it makes them caterwaul and\nswear on the tiles, seeing how it fills the lives of men with torments\nand villanies.\"\n\nBoth had had the tact to greet each other as friends who had parted the\nnight before to take their night's rest, and though grown strangers to\neach other, they conversed with a good grace and on a footing of\nfriendliness.\n\nAt the same time Madame de Rochemaure seemed pensive. The Revolution,\nwhich had for a long while been pleasant and profitable to her, was now\na source of anxiety and disquietude; her suppers were growing less\nbrilliant and less merry. The notes of her harp no longer charmed the\ncloud from sombre faces. Her play-tables were forsaken by the most\nlavish punters. Many of her cronies, now numbered among the suspects,\nwere in hiding; her lover, Morhardt the financier, was under arrest,\nand it was on his behalf she had come to sound the juror Gamelin. She\nwas suspect herself. A posse of National Guards had made a search at her\nhouse, had turned out the drawers of her cabinets, prised up boards in\nher floor, thrust their bayonets into her mattresses. They had found\nnothing, had made their apologies and drunk her wine. But they had come\nvery near lighting on her correspondence with an _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_, Monsieur\nd'Expilly. Certain friends he had among the Jacobins had warned her that\nHenry, her handsome favourite, was beginning to compromise his party by\nhis violent language, which was too extravagant to be sincere.\n\nElbows on knees and head on fist, she sat buried in thought; then\nturning to her old lover sitting on the palliasse, she asked:\n\n\"What do you think of it all, Maurice?\"\n\n\"I think these good gentry give a philosopher and an amateur of the\nshows of life abundant matter for reflection and amusement; but that it\nwould be better for you, my dear, if you were out of France.\"\n\n\"Maurice, where will it land us?\"\n\n\"That is what you asked me, Louise, one day we were driving on the banks\nof the Cher, on the road to Les Ilettes; the horse, you remember, had\ntaken the bit in his teeth and was galloping off with us at a frantic\npace. How inquisitive women are! to-day, for the second time, you want\nto know where we are going to. Ask the fortune-tellers. I am not a\nwizard, sweetheart. And philosophy, even the soundest, is of small help\nfor revealing the future. These things will have an end; everything has.\nOne may foresee divers issues. The triumph of the Coalition and the\nentry of the allies into Paris. They are not far off; yet I doubt if\nthey will get there. These soldiers of the Republic take their beatings\nwith a zest nothing can extinguish. It may be Robespierre will marry\nMadame Royale and have himself proclaimed Protector of the Kingdom\nduring the minority of Louis XVII.\"\n\n\"You think so!\" exclaimed the _citoyenne_, agog to have a hand in so\npromising an intrigue.\n\n\"Again it may be,\" Brotteaux went on, \"that La Vend\u00c3\u00a9e will win the day\nand the rule of the priests be set up again over heaps of ruins and\npiles of corpses. You cannot conceive, dear heart, the empire the clergy\nstill wields over the masses of the foolish,... I beg pardon, I meant to\nsay,--of 'the Faithful'; it was a slip of the tongue. The most likely\nthing, in my poor opinion, is that the Revolutionary Tribunal will bring\nabout the destruction of the r\u00c3\u00a9gime it has established; it is a menace\nover too many heads. Those it terrifies are without number; they will\nunite together, and to destroy it they will destroy the whole system of\ngovernment. I think you have got our young friend Gamelin posted to this\ncourt. He is virtuous; he will be implacable. The more I think of it,\nfair friend, the more convinced I am that this Tribunal, set up to save\nthe Republic, will destroy it. The Convention has resolved to have, like\nRoyalty, its _Grands Jours_,[5] its _Chambre Ardente_, and to provide\nfor its security by means of magistrates appointed by itself and by it\nkept in subjection. But how inferior are the Convention's _Grands Jours_\nto those of the Monarchy, and its _Chambre Ardente_ to that of Louis\nXIV! The Revolutionary Tribunal is dominated by a sentiment of\nmean-spirited justice and common equality that will quickly make it\nodious and ridiculous and will disgust everybody. Do you know, Louise,\nthat this tribunal, which is about to cite to its bar the Queen of\nFrance and twenty-one legislators, yesterday condemned a servant-girl\nconvicted of crying: 'Vive le Roi!' with malicious intent and in the\nhope of destroying the Republic? Our judges, with their black hats and\nplumes, are working on the model of that William Shakespeare, so dear to\nthe heart of Englishmen, who drags in coarse buffooneries in the middle\nof his most tragic scenes.\"\n\n\"Ah, well! Maurice,\" asked the _citoyenne_, \"are you still as fortunate\nas ever with women?\"\n\n\"Alas!\" replied Brotteaux, \"the doves flock to the bright new dovecote\nand light no more on the ruined tower.\"\n\n\"You have not changed.... Good-bye, dear friend,--till we meet again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe same evening the dragoon Henry, paying a visit uninvited at Madame\nde Rochemaure's, found her in the act of sealing a letter on which he\nread the address of the _citoyen_ Rauline at Vernon. The letter, he\nknew, was for England. Rauline used to receive Madame de Rochemaure's\ncommunications by a postilion of the posting-service and send them on to\nDieppe by the hands of a fishwife. The master of a fishing-smack\ndelivered them under cover of night to a British ship cruising off the\ncoast; an _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_, Monsieur d'Expilly, received them in London and\npassed them on, if he thought it advisable, to the Cabinet of Saint\nJames's.\n\nHenry was young and good looking; Achilles was not such a paragon of\ngrace and vigour when he donned the armour Ulysses offered him. But the\n_citoyenne_ Rochemaure, once so enraptured by the charms of the young\nhero of the Commune, now looked askance at him; her mood had changed\nsince the day she was told how the young soldier had been denounced at\nthe Jacobins as one whose zeal outran discretion and that he might\ncompromise and ruin her. Henry thought it might not break his heart\nperhaps to leave off loving Madame de Rochemaure; but he was piqued to\nhave fallen in her good graces. He counted on her to meet sundry\nexpenses in which the service of the Republic had involved him. Last but\nnot least, remembering to what extremities women will proceed and how\nthey go in a flash from the most ardent tenderness to the coldest\nindifference, and how easy they find it to sacrifice what once they held\ndear and destroy what once they adored, he began to suspect that some\nday his fascinating mistress might have him thrown into prison to get\nrid of him. Common prudence urged him to regain his lost ascendancy and\nto this end he had come armed with all his fascinations. He came near,\ndrew away, came near again, hovered round her, ran from her, in the\napproved fashion of seduction in the ballet. Then he threw himself in an\narmchair and in his irresistible voice, his voice that went straight to\nwomen's hearts, he extolled the charms of nature and solitude and with a\nlovelorn sigh proposed an expedition to Ermenonville.\n\nMeanwhile she was striking chords on her harp and looking about her with\nan expression of impatience and boredom. Suddenly Henry got up with a\ngesture of gloomy resolution and informed her that he was starting for\nthe army and in a few days would be before Maubeuge.\n\nWithout a sign either of scepticism or surprise she nodded her approval.\n\n\"You congratulate me on my decision?\"\n\n\"I do indeed.\"\n\nShe was expecting a new admirer who was infinitely to her taste and from\nwhom she hoped to reap great advantages,--a contrast in every way to the\nold, a Mirabeau come to life again, a Danton rehabilitated and turned\narmy-contractor, a lion who talked of pitching every patriot into the\nSeine. She was on tenter-hooks, thinking to hear the bell ring at any\nmoment.\n\nTo hasten Henry's departure, she fell silent, yawned, fingered a score,\nand yawned again. Seeing he made no move to go, she told him she had to\ngo out and withdrew into her dressing-room.\n\nHe called to her in a broken voice:\n\n\"Farewell, Louise!... Shall I ever see you again?\"--and his hands were\nbusy fumbling in the open writing-desk.\n\nWhen he reached the street, he opened the letter addressed to the\n_citoyen_ Rauline and read it with absorbed attention. Indeed it drew a\ncurious picture of the state of public feeling in France. It spoke of\nthe Queen, of the actress Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin, of the Revolutionary Tribunal\nand a host of confidential remarks emanating from that worthy, Brotteaux\ndes Ilettes, were repeated in it.\n\nHaving read to the end and restored the missive to his pocket, he stood\nhesitating a few moments; then, like a man who has made up his mind and\nsays to himself \"the sooner the better,\" he turned his steps to the\nTuileries and found his way into the antechamber of the Committee of\nGeneral Security.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe same day, at three o'clock of the afternoon, \u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin was\nseated on the jurors' bench along with fourteen colleagues, most of whom\nhe knew, simple-minded, honest, patriotic folks, savants, artists or\nartisans,--a painter like himself, an artist in black-and-white, both\nmen of talent, a surgeon, a cobbler, a _ci-devant_ marquis, who had\ngiven high proofs of patriotism, a printer, two or three small\ntradesmen, a sample lot in a word of the inhabitants of Paris. There\nthey sat, in the workman's blouse or bourgeois coat, with their hair\nclose-cropped _\u00c3\u00a0 la Titus_ or clubbed _\u00c3\u00a0 la catogan_; there were\ncocked-hats tilted over the eyes, round hats clapped on the back of the\nhead, red caps of liberty smothering the ears. Some were dressed in\ncoat, flapped waistcoat and breeches, as in olden days, others in the\n_carmagnole_ and striped trousers of the sansculottes. Wearing top-boots\nor buckled shoes or sabots, they offered in their persons every variety\nof masculine attire prevalent at that date. Having all of them occupied\ntheir places on several previous occasions, they seemed very much at\ntheir ease, and Gamelin envied them their unconcern. His own heart was\nthumping, his ears roaring; a mist was before his eyes and everything\nabout him took on a livid tinge.\n\nWhen the usher announced the opening of the sitting, three judges took\ntheir places on a raised platform of no great size in front of a green\ntable. They wore hats cockaded and crowned with great black plumes and\nthe official cloak with a tricolour riband from which a heavy silver\nmedal was suspended on the breast. In front of them at the foot of the\nda\u00c3\u00afs, sat the deputy of the Public Prosecutor, similarly attired. The\nclerk of the court had a seat between the judges' bench and the\nprisoner's chair, at present unoccupied. To Gamelin's eyes these men\nwore a different aspect from that of every day; they seemed nobler,\ngraver, more alarming, albeit their bearing was commonplace enough as\nthey turned over papers, beckoned to an usher or leant back to listen to\nsome communication from a juryman or an officer of the court.\n\nAbove the judges' heads hung the tables of the Rights of Man; to their\nright and left, against the old feudal walls, the busts of Le Peltier\nSaint-Fargeau and Marat. Facing the jury bench, at the lower end of the\nhall, rose the public gallery. The first row of seats was filled by\nwomen, who all, fair, brown and grey-haired alike, wore the high coif\nwith the pleated tucker shading their cheeks; the breast, which\ninvariably, as decreed by the fashion of the day, showed the amplitude\nof the nursing mother's bosom, was covered with a crossed white kerchief\nor the rounded bib of a blue apron. They sat with folded arms resting on\nthe rail of the tribune. Behind them, scattered about the rising tiers,\ncould be seen a sprinkling of citizens dressed in the varied garb which\nat that date gave every gathering so striking and picturesque a\ncharacter. On the right hand, near the doors, behind a broad barrier, a\nspace was reserved where the public could stand. On this occasion it was\nnearly empty. The business that was to occupy the attention of this\nparticular section of the tribunal interested only a few spectators,\nwhile doubtless the other sections sitting at the same hour would be\nhearing more exciting cases.\n\nThis fact somewhat reassured Gamelin; his heart was like to fail him as\nit was, and he could not have endured the heated atmosphere of one of\nthe great days. His eyes took in the most trifling details of the\nscene,--the cotton-wool in the _greffier's_ ear and a blot of ink on the\nDeputy Prosecutor's papers. He could see, as through a magnifying glass,\nthe capitals of the pillars sculptured at a time when all knowledge of\nthe classical orders was forgotten and which crowned the Gothic columns\nwith wreaths of nettle and holly. But wherever he looked, his gaze came\nback again and again to the fatal chair; this was of an antiquated make,\ncovered in red Utrecht velvet, the seat worn and the arms blackened with\nuse. Armed National Guards stood guarding every door.\n\nAt last the accused appeared, escorted by grenadiers, but with limbs\nunbound, as the law directed. He was a man of fifty or thereabouts, lean\nand dry, with a brown face, a very bald head, hollow cheeks and thin\nlivid lips, dressed in an out-of-date coat of a sanguine red. No doubt\nit was fever that made his eyes glitter like jewels and gave his cheeks\ntheir shiny, varnished look. He took his seat. His legs, which he\ncrossed, were extraordinarily spare and his great knotted hands met\nround the knees they clasped. His name was Marie-Adolphe Guillergues,\nand he was accused of malversation in the supply of forage to the\nRepublican troops. The act of indictment laid to his charge numerous and\nserious offences, of which no single one was positively certain. Under\nexamination, Guillergues denied the majority of the charges and\nexplained the rest in a light favourable to himself. He spoke in a\ncold, precise way, with a marked ability and gave the impression of\nbeing a dangerous man to have business dealings with. He had an answer\nfor everything. When the judge asked him an embarrassing question, his\nface remained unmoved and his voice confident, but his two hands, folded\non his breast, kept twitching in an agony. Gamelin was struck by this\nand whispered to the colleague sitting next him, a painter like himself:\n\n\"Watch his thumbs!\"\n\nThe first witness to depose alleged a number of most damaging facts. He\nwas the mainstay of the prosecution. Those on the other hand who\nfollowed showed themselves well disposed to the prisoner. The Deputy of\nthe Public Prosecutor spoke strongly, but did not go beyond\ngeneralities. The advocate for the defence adopted a tone of bluff\nconviction of his client's innocence that earned the accused a sympathy\nhe had failed to secure by his own efforts. The sitting was suspended\nand the jury assembled in the room set apart for deliberation. There,\nafter a confused and confusing discussion, they found themselves divided\nin two groups about equal in number. On the one side were the\nunemotional, the lukewarm, the men of reason, whom no passion could\nstir, on the other the kind who let their feelings guide them, who prove\nall but inaccessible to argument and only consult their heart. These\nalways voted guilty. They were the true metal, pure and unadulterated;\ntheir only thought was to save the Republic and they cared not a straw\nfor anything else. Their attitude made a strong impression on Gamelin\nwho felt he was of the same kidney himself.\n\n\"This Guillergues,\" he thought to himself, \"is a cunning scamp, a\nvillain who has speculated in the forage supplied to our cavalry. To\nacquit him is to let a traitor escape, to be false to the fatherland, to\ndevote the army to defeat.\" And in a flash Gamelin could see the Hussars\nof the Republic, mounted on stumbling horses, sabred by the enemy's\ncavalry.... \"But if Guillergues was innocent...?\"\n\nSuddenly he remembered Jean Blaise, likewise suspected of bad faith in\nthe matter of supplies. There were bound to be many others acting like\nGuillergues and Blaise, contriving disaster, ruining the Republic! An\nexample must be made. But if Guillergues was innocent...?\n\n\"There are no proofs,\" said Gamelin, aloud.\n\n\"There never are,\" retorted the foreman of the jury, shrugging his\nshoulders; he was good metal, pure metal!\n\nIn the end, there proved to be seven votes for condemnation, eight for\nacquittal.\n\nThe jury re-entered the hall and the sitting was resumed. The jurors\nwere required to give reasons for their verdict, and each spoke in turn\nfacing the empty chair. Some were prolix, others confined themselves to\na sentence; one or two talked unintelligible gabble.\n\nWhen Gamelin's turn came, he rose and said:\n\n\"In presence of a crime so heinous as that of robbing the defenders of\nthe fatherland of the sinews of victory, we need formal proofs which we\nhave not got.\"\n\nBy a majority of votes the accused was declared not guilty.\n\nGuillergues was brought in again and stood before his judges amid a hum\nof sympathy from the spectators which conveyed the news of his acquittal\nto him. He was another man. His features had lost their harshness, his\nlips were relaxed again. He looked venerable; his face bore the\nimpression of innocence. The President read out in tones of emotion the\nverdict releasing the prisoner; the audience broke into applause. The\ngendarme who had brought Guillergues in threw himself into his arms. The\nPresident called him to the da\u00c3\u00afs and gave him the embrace of\nbrotherhood. The jurors kissed him, while Gamelin's eyes rained hot\ntears.\n\nThe courtyard of the Palais, dimly lighted by the last rays of the\nsetting sun, was filled with a howling, excited crowd. The four sections\nof the Tribunal had the day before pronounced thirty sentences of death,\nand on the steps of the Great Stairway a throng of _tricoteuses_\nsquatted to see the tumbrils start. But Gamelin, as he descended the\nsteps among the press of jurors and spectators, saw nothing, heard\nnothing but his own act of justice and humanity and the\nself-congratulation he felt at having recognized innocence. In the\ncourtyard stood \u00c3\u0089lodie, all in white, smiling through her tears; she\nthrew herself into his arms and lay there half fainting. When she had\nrecovered her voice, she said to him:\n\n\"\u00c3\u0089variste, you are noble, you are good, you are generous! In the hall\nthere, your voice, so gentle and manly, went right through me with its\nmagnetic waves. It electrified me. I gazed at you on your bench, I could\nsee no one but you. But you, dear heart, you never guessed I was there?\nNothing told you I was present? I sat in the gallery in the second row\nto the right. By heaven! how sweet it is to do the right! you saved\nthat unhappy man's life. Without you, it was all over with him; he was\nas good as dead. You have given him back to life and the love of his\nfriends. At this moment he must bless you. \u00c3\u0089variste, how happy I am and\nhow proud to love you!\"\n\nArm in arm, pressed close to one another, they went along the streets;\ntheir bodies felt so light they seemed to be flying.\n\nThey went to the _Amour peintre_. On reaching the Oratoire:\n\n\"Better not go through the shop,\" \u00c3\u0089lodie suggested.\n\nShe made him go in by the main coach-door and mount the stairs with her\nto the suite of rooms above. On the landing she drew out of her reticule\na heavy iron key.\n\n\"It might be the key of a prison,\" she exclaimed, \"\u00c3\u0089variste, you are\ngoing to be my prisoner.\"\n\nThey crossed the dining-room and were in the girl's bedchamber.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste felt upon his the ardent freshness of \u00c3\u0089lodie's lips. He pressed\nher in his arms; with head thrown back and swooning eyes, her hair\nflowing loose over her relaxed form, half fainting, she escaped his hold\nand ran to shoot the bolt....\n\nThe night was far advanced when the _citoyenne_ Blaise opened the outer\ndoor of the flat for her lover and whispered to him in the darkness.\n\n\"Good-bye, sweetheart! it is the hour my father will be coming home. If\nyou hear a noise on the stairs, go up quick to the higher floor and\ndon't come down till all danger is over of your being seen. To have the\nstreet-door opened, give three raps on the _concierge's_ window.\nGood-bye, my life, good-bye, my soul!\"\n\nWhen he found himself in the street, he saw the window of \u00c3\u0089lodie's\nchamber half unclose and a little hand pluck a red carnation, which fell\nat his feet like a drop of blood.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[5] _Grands Jours_,--under the ancien r\u00c3\u00a9gime, an extraordinary assize\nheld by judges specially appointed by the King and acting in his name.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nOne evening when old Brotteaux arrived in the Rue de la Loi bringing a\ngross of dancing-dolls for the _citoyen_ Caillou, the toy-merchant, the\nlatter, a soft-spoken, polite man as a rule, stood there stiff and stern\namong his dolls and punch-and-judies and gave him a far from gracious\nwelcome.\n\n\"Have a care, _citoyen_ Brotteaux,\" he began, \"have a care! There is a\ntime to laugh, and a time to be serious; jokes are not always in good\ntaste. A member of the Committee of Security of the Section, who\ninspected my establishment yesterday, saw your dancing-dolls and deemed\nthem anti-revolutionary.\"\n\n\"He was jesting!\" declared Brotteaux.\n\n\"Not so, _citoyen_, not at all. He is not the man to joke. He said in\nthese little fellows the National representatives were insidiously\nmimicked, that in particular one could discover caricatures of Couthon,\nSaint-Just and Robespierre, and he seized the lot. It is a dead loss to\nme, to say nothing of the grave risks to which I am exposed.\"\n\n\"What! these Harlequins, these Gilles, these Scaramouches, these Colins\nand Colinettes, which I have painted the same as Boucher used to fifty\nyears ago, how should they be parodies of Couthons and Saint-Justs? No\nsensible man could imagine such a thing.\"\n\n\"It is possible,\" replied the _citoyen_ Caillou, \"that you acted\nwithout malice, albeit we must always distrust a man of parts like you.\nBut it is a dangerous game. Shall I give you an instance? Natoile, who\nruns a little outdoor theatre in the Champs \u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es, was arrested the\nday before yesterday for anti-patriotism, because he made Polichinelle\npoke fun at the Convention.\"\n\n\"Now listen to me,\" Brotteaux urged, raising the cloth that covered his\nlittle dangling figures; \"just look at these masks and faces, are they\nanything else whatever but characters in plays and pastorals? How could\nyou let yourself be persuaded, _citoyen_ Caillou, that I was making fun\nof the National Convention?\"\n\nBrotteaux was dumfounded. While allowing much for human folly, he had\nnot thought it possible it could ever go so far as to suspect his\nScaramouches and Colinettes. Repeatedly he protested their innocence and\nhis; but the _citoyen_ Caillou would not hear a word.\n\n\"_Citoyen_ Brotteaux, take your dolls away. I esteem you, I honour you,\nbut I do not mean to incur blame or get into trouble because of you. I\nintend to remain a good citizen and to be treated as such. Good evening,\n_citoyen_ Brotteaux; take your dolls away.\"\n\nThe old man set out again for home, carrying his suspects over his\nshoulder at the end of a pole, an object of derision to the children,\nwho took him for the hawker of rat-poison. His thoughts were gloomy. No\ndoubt, he did not live only by his dancing-dolls; he used to paint\nportraits at twenty _sols_ apiece, under the archways of doors or in one\nof the market halls, among the darners and old-clothes menders, where he\nfound many a young recruit starting for the front and wanting to leave\nhis likeness behind for his sweetheart. But these petty tasks cost him\nendless pains, and he was a long way from making as good portraits as he\ndid dancing-dolls. Sometimes, too, he acted as amanuensis for the\nMarket dames, but this meant mixing himself up in Royalist plots, and\nthe risks were heavy. He remembered there lived in the Rue\nNeuve-des-Petits-Champs, near the erstwhile Place Vend\u00c3\u00b4me, another\ntoy-merchant, Joly by name, and he resolved to go next day to offer him\nthe goods the chicken-hearted Caillou had declined.\n\nA fine rain began to fall. Brotteaux who feared its effects on his\nmarionettes, quickened his pace. As he crossed the Pont-Neuf and was\nturning the corner of the Place de Thionville, he saw by the light of a\nstreet-lamp, sitting on a stone post, a lean old man who seemed utterly\nexhausted with fatigue and hunger, but still preserved his venerable\nappearance. He was dressed in a tattered surtout, had no hat and\nappeared over sixty. Approaching the poor wretch, Brotteaux recognised\nthe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, the same he had saved from hanging six months\nbefore while both of them were waiting in queue in front of the bakery\nin the Rue de J\u00c3\u00a9rusalem. Feeling bound to the monk by the service he had\nalready done him, Brotteaux stepped up to him and made himself known as\nthe publican who had stood beside him among the common herd, one day of\ngreat scarcity, and asked him if he could not be of some use to him.\n\n\"You seem wearied, Father. Take a taste of cordial,\"--and Brotteaux drew\nfrom the pocket of his plum-coloured coat a flask of brandy, which lay\nthere alongside his Lucretius.\n\n\"Drink. And I will help you to get back to your house.\"\n\nThe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare pushed away the flask with his hand and tried to\nrise, but only to fall back again in his seat.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said in a weak but firm voice, \"for three months I have been\nliving at Picpus. Being warned they had come to arrest me at my lodging,\nyesterday at five o'clock of the afternoon, I did not return home. I\nhave no place to go to; I am wandering the streets and am a little\nfatigued.\"\n\n\"Very well, Father,\" proposed Brotteaux, \"do me the honour to share my\ngarret.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the Barnabite, \"you know, I suppose, I am a suspect.\"\n\n\"I am one too,\" said Brotteaux, \"and my marionettes into the bargain,\nwhich is the worst thing of all. You see them exposed under this flimsy\ncloth to the fine rain that chills our bones. For, I must tell you,\nFather, that after having been a publican, I now make dancing-dolls for\na living.\"\n\nThe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare took the hand the _ci-devant_ financier extended to\nhim and accepted the hospitality offered. Brotteaux, in his garret,\nserved him a meal of bread and cheese and wine, which last he had put to\ncool in the rain-gutter, for was he not a Sybarite?\n\nHaving appeased his hunger:\n\n\"Sir,\" said the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, \"I ought to inform you of the\ncircumstances that led to my flight and left me to die on yonder post\nwhere you found me. Driven from my cloister, I lived on the scanty\nallowance the Assembly had assigned to me; I gave lessons in Latin and\nMathematics and I wrote pamphlets on the persecution of the Church of\nFrance. I have even composed a work of some length, to prove that the\nConstitutional oath of the Priests is subversive of Ecclesiastical\ndiscipline. The advances made by the Revolution deprived me of all my\npupils, while I could not get my pension because I had not the\ncertificate of citizenship required by law. This certificate I went to\nthe H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville to claim, in the conviction I was well entitled to\nit. Member of an order founded by the Apostle Paul himself, who boasted\nthe title of Roman citizen, I always piqued myself on behaving after his\nexample as a good French citizen, a respecter of all human laws which\nare not in opposition to the Divine. I presented my demand to Monsieur\nColin, pork-butcher and Municipal officer, in charge of the delivery of\ncertificates of the sort. He questioned me as to my calling. I told him\nI was a Priest. He asked me if I was married, and on my answering that I\nwas not, he told me that was the worse for me. Finally, after a variety\nof questions, he asked me if I had proved my citizenship on the 10th\nAugust, the 2nd September and the 31st May. 'No certificates can be\ngiven,' he added, 'except to such as have proved their patriotism by\ntheir behaviour on these three occasions.' I could not give him an\nanswer that would satisfy him. However, he took down my name and address\nand promised me to make prompt enquiry into my case. He kept his word,\nand as the result of his enquiry two Commissioners of the Committee of\nGeneral Security of Picpus, supported by an armed band, presented\nthemselves at my lodging in my absence to conduct me to prison. I do not\nknow of what crime I am accused. But you will agree with me one must\npity Monsieur Colin, whose wits are so clouded he holds it a reproach\nto an ecclesiastic not to have made display of his patriotism on the\n10th August, the 2nd September, and the 31st May. A man capable of such\na notion is surely deserving of commiseration.\"\n\n\"_I_ am in the same plight, I have no certificate,\" observed Brotteaux.\n\"We are both suspects. But you are weary. To bed, Father. We will\ndiscuss plans to-morrow for your safety.\"\n\nHe gave the mattress to his guest and kept the palliasse for himself;\nbut the monk in his humility demanded the latter with so much urgency\nthat his wish had to be complied with; otherwise he would have slept on\nthe boards.\n\nThese arrangements completed, Brotteaux blew out the candle both to save\ntallow and as a wise precaution.\n\n\"Sir,\" the monk addressed him, \"I am thankful for what you are doing for\nme; but alas! it is of small moment to you whether I am grateful or no.\nMay God account your act meritorious! _That_ is of infinite concern for\nyou. But God pays no heed to what is not done for his glory and is\nmerely the outcome of purely natural virtue. Wherefore I beseech you,\nsir, to do for Him what you were led to do for me.\"\n\n\"Father,\" answered Brotteaux, \"never trouble yourself on this head and\ndo not think of gratitude. What I am doing now, the merit of which you\nexaggerate,--is not done for any love of you; for indeed, albeit you are\na lovable man, Father, I know you too little to love you. Nor yet do I\nact so for love of humanity; for I am not so simple as to think with\n'Don Juan' that humanity has rights; indeed this prejudice, in a mind so\nemancipated as his, grieves me. I do it out of that selfishness which\ninspires mankind to perform all their deeds of generosity and\nself-sacrifice, by making them recognize themselves in all who are\nunfortunate, by disposing them to commiserate their own calamities in\nthe calamities of others and by inciting them to offer help to a mortal\nresembling themselves in nature and destiny, so that they think they are\nsuccouring themselves in succouring him. I do it also for lack of\nanything better to do; for life is so desperately insipid we must find\ndistraction at any cost, and benevolence is an amusement, of a mawkish\nsort, one indulges in for want of any more savoury; I do it out of pride\nand to get an advantage over you; I do it, in a word, as part of a\nsystem and to show you what an atheist is capable of.\"\n\n\"Do not calumniate yourself, sir,\" replied the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare. \"I have\nreceived of God more marks of grace than He has accorded you hitherto;\nbut I am not as good a man as you, and am greatly your inferior in\nnatural merits. But now let me take an advantage too over you. Not\nknowing me, you cannot love me. And I, sir, without knowing you, I love\nyou better than myself; God bids me do so.\"\n\nHaving so said, the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare knelt down on the floor, and after\nrepeating his prayers, stretched himself on his palliasse and fell\npeacefully asleep.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin occupied his place as juror of the Tribunal for the\nsecond time. Before the opening of the sitting, he discussed with his\ncolleagues the news that had arrived that morning. Some of it was\ndoubtful, some untrue; but part was authentic--and appalling; the armies\nof the coalition in command of all the roads and marching _en masse_ on\nParis, La Vend\u00c3\u00a9e triumphant, Lyons in insurrection, Toulon surrendered\nto the English, who were landing fourteen thousand men there.\n\nFor him and his fellow magistrates these were not only events of\ninterest to all the world, but so many matters of domestic concern.\nForedoomed to perish in the ruin of the fatherland, they made the public\nsalvation their own proper business. The Nation's interests, thus\nentangled with their own, dictated their opinions and passions and\nconduct.\n\nGamelin, where he sat on the jury bench, was handed a letter from\nTrubert, Secretary of the Committee of Defence; it was to notify his\nappointment as Commissioner of Supplies of Powder and Saltpetre:\n\n     _\"You will excavate all the cellars in the Section in order to\n     extract the substances necessary for the manufacture of powder.\n     To-morrow perhaps the enemy will be before Paris; the soil of the\n     fatherland must provide us with the lightning we shall launch\n     against our aggressors. I send you herewith a schedule of\n     instructions from the Convention regarding the manipulation of\n     saltpetres. Farewell and brotherly greeting.\"_\n\nAt that moment the accused was brought in. He was one of the last of the\ndefeated Generals whom the Convention delivered over one after the other\nto the Tribunal, and the most insignificant. At sight of him Gamelin\nshuddered; once again he seemed to see the same soldier whom three weeks\nbefore, looking on as a spectator, he had seen sentenced and sent to the\nguillotine. The man was the same, with his obstinate, opinionated look;\nthe procedure was the same. He gave his answers in a cunning, brutish\nway that ruined the effect even of the most convincing. His cavilling\nand chicanery and the accusations he levelled against his subordinates,\nmade you forget he was fulfilling the honourable task of defending his\nhonour and his life. Everything was uncertain, every statement\ndisputed,--position of the armies, total of forces engaged, munitions of\nwar, orders given, orders received, movements of troops; nobody knew\nanything. It was impossible to make head or tail of these confused,\nnonsensical, aimless operations which had ended in disaster; defending\ncounsel and the accused himself were as much in the dark as were\naccuser, judges, and jury, and strange to say, not a soul would admit,\nwhether to himself or to other people, that this was the case. The\njudges took a childish delight in drawing plans and discussing problems\nof tactics and strategy, while the prisoner constantly betrayed his\ninborn predilection for crooked ways.\n\nThe arguments dragged on endlessly. And all the time Gamelin could see\non the rough roads of the north the ammunition wagons stogged in the\nmire and the guns capsized in the ruts, and along all the ways the\nbroken and beaten columns flying in disorder, while from all sides the\nenemy's cavalry was debouching by the abandoned defiles. And from this\nhost of men betrayed he could hear a mighty shout going up in accusation\nof the General. When the hearing closed, darkness was falling on the\nhall, and the head of Marat gleamed half-seen like a phantom above the\nPresident's head. The jury was called upon to give judgment, but was of\ntwo minds. Gamelin, in a hoarse, strangled voice, but in resolute\naccents, declared the accused guilty of treason against the Republic,\nand a murmur of approval rose from the crowd, a flattering unction to\nhis youthful virtue. The sentence was read by the light of torches which\ncast a lurid, uncertain gleam on the prisoner's hollow temples beaded\nwith drops of sweat. Outside the doors, on the steps crowded with the\ncustomary swarm of cockaded harridans, Gamelin could hear his name,\nwhich the habitu\u00c3\u00a9s of the Tribunal were beginning to know, passed from\nmouth to mouth, and was assailed by a bevy of _tricoteuses_ who shook\ntheir fists in his face, demanding the head of _the Austrian_.\n\nThe next day \u00c3\u0089variste had to give judgment on the fate of a poor woman,\nthe widow Meyrion. She distributed bread from house to house and tramped\nthe streets pushing a little hand-cart and carrying a wooden tally hung\nat her waist, on which she cut notches with her knife representing the\nnumber of the loaves she had delivered. Her gains amounted to eight sous\na day. The deputy of the Public Prosecutor displayed an extraordinary\nvirulence towards the wretched creature, who had, it appears, shouted\n\"Vive le Roi!\" on several occasions, uttered anti-revolutionary remarks\nin the houses where she called to leave the daily dole of bread, and\nbeen mixed up in a plot for the escape of the woman Capet. In answer to\nthe Judge's question she admitted the facts alleged against her; whether\nfool or fanatic, she professed Royalist sentiments of the most\nenthusiastic sort and waited her doom.\n\nThe Revolutionary Tribunal made a point of proving the triumph of\nEquality by showing itself just as severe for street-porters and servant\nmaids as for the aristocrats and financiers. Gamelin could conceive no\nother system possible under a popular government. He would have deemed\nit a mark of contempt, an insult to the people, to exclude it from\npunishment. That would have been to consider it, so to speak, as\nunworthy of chastisement by the law. Reserved for aristocrats only, the\nguillotine would have appeared to him in the light of an iniquitous\nprivilege. In his thoughts he was beginning to erect chastisement into a\nreligious and mystic dogma, to assign it a virtue, a merit of its own;\nhe conceived that society owes punishment to criminals and that it is\ndoing them an injustice to cheat them of this right. He declared the\nwoman Meyrion guilty and deserving of death, only regretting that the\nfanatics, more culpable than herself, who had brought her to her ruin,\nwere not there to share her fate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery evening almost \u00c3\u0089variste attended the meetings of the Jacobins, who\nassembled in the former chapel of the Dominicans, commonly known as\nJacobins, in the Rue Honor\u00c3\u00a9. In a courtyard, in which stood a tree of\nLiberty, a poplar whose leaves shook and rustled all day in the wind,\nthe chapel, built in a poor, clumsy style and surmounted by a heavy roof\nof tiles, showed its bare gable, pierced by a round window and an\narched doorway, above which floated the National colours, the flagstaff\ncrowned with the cap of Liberty. The Jacobins, like the Cordeliers, and\nthe Feuillants, had appropriated the premises and taken the name of the\ndispossessed monks. Gamelin, once a regular attendant at the sittings of\nthe Cordeliers, did not find at the Jacobins the familiar sabots,\ncarmagnoles and rallying cries of the Dantonists. In Robespierre's club\nadministrative reserve and bourgeois gravity were the order of the day.\nThe Friend of the People was no more, and since his death \u00c3\u0089variste had\nfollowed the lessons of Maximilien whose thought ruled the Jacobins, and\nthence, through a thousand affiliated societies was disseminated over\nall France. During the reading of the minutes, his eyes wandered over\nthe bare, dismal walls, which, after sheltering the spiritual sons of\nthe arch-inquisitor of heresy, now looked down on the assemblage of\nzealous inquisitors of crimes against the fatherland.\n\nThere, without pomp or ceremony, sat the body that was the chiefest\npower of the State and ruled by force of words. It governed the city,\nthe empire, dictated its decrees to the Convention itself. These\nartisans of the new order of things, so respectful of the law that they\ncontinued Royalists in 1791 and would fain have been Royalists still on\nthe King's return from Varennes, so obstinate in their attachment to the\nConstitution, friends of the established order of the State even after\nthe massacres of the Champ-de-Mars, and never revolutionaries against\nthe Revolution, heedless of popular agitation, cherished in their dark\nand puissant soul a love of the fatherland that had given birth to\nfourteen armies and set up the guillotine. \u00c3\u0089variste was lost in\nadmiration of their vigilance, their suspicious temper, their reasoned\ndogmatism, their love of system, their supremacy in the art of\ngoverning, their sovereign sanity.\n\nThe public that formed the audience gave no token of their presence save\na low, long-drawn murmur as of one voice, like the rustling of the\nleaves of the tree of Liberty that stood outside the threshold.\n\nThat day, the 11th Vend\u00c3\u00a9miaire, a young man, with a receding brow, a\npiercing eye, a sharp prominent nose, a pointed chin, a pock-marked\nface, a look of cold self-possession, mounted the tribune slowly. His\nhair was white with powder and he wore a blue coat that displayed his\nslim figure. He showed the precise carriage and moved with the cadenced\nstep that made some say in mockery that he was like a dancing-master and\nearned him from others the name of the \"French Orpheus.\" Robespierre,\nspeaking in a clear voice, delivered an eloquent discourse against the\nenemies of the Republic. He belaboured with metaphysical and\nuncompromising arguments Brissot and his accomplices. He spoke at great\nlength, in free-flowing harmonious periods. Soaring in the celestial\nspheres of philosophy, he launched his lightnings at the base\nconspirators crawling on the ground.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste heard and understood. Till then he had blamed the Gironde; were\nthey not working for the restoration of the monarchy or the triumph of\nthe Orleans faction, were they not planning the ruin of the heroic city\nthat had delivered France from her fetters and would one day deliver the\nuniverse? Now, as he listened to the sage's voice, he discerned truths\nof a higher and purer compass; he grasped a revolutionary metaphysic\nwhich lifted his mind above coarse, material conditions into a region of\nabsolute, unqualified convictions, untrammelled by the errors of the\nsenses. Things are in their nature involved and full of confusion; the\ncomplexity of circumstances is such that we lose our way amongst them.\nRobespierre simplified them to his mind, put good and evil before him in\nclear and precise formulas. Federalism,--indivisibility; unity and\nindivisibility meant salvation, federalism, damnation. Gamelin tasted\nthe ineffable joy of a believer who knows the word that saves and the\nword that destroys the soul. Henceforth the Revolutionary Tribunal, as\nof old the ecclesiastical courts, would take cognizance of crime\nabsolute, of crime definable in a word. And, because he had the\nreligious spirit, \u00c3\u0089variste welcomed these revelations with a sombre\nenthusiasm; his heart swelled and rejoiced at the thought that,\nhenceforth, he had a talisman to discern betwixt crime and innocence, he\npossessed a creed! Ye stand in lieu of all else, oh, treasures of faith!\n\nThe sage Maximilien enlightened him further as to the perfidious intent\nof those who were for equalizing property and partitioning the land,\nabolishing wealth and poverty and establishing a happy mediocrity for\nall. Misled by their specious maxims, he had originally approved their\ndesigns, which he deemed in accord with the principles of a true\nRepublican. But Robespierre, in his speeches at the Jacobins, had\nunmasked their machinations and convinced him that these men,\ndisinterested as their intentions appeared, were working to overthrow\nthe Republic, that they were alarming the rich only to rouse against the\nlawful authority powerful and implacable foes. Once private property\nwas threatened, the whole population, the more ardently attached to its\npossessions the less of these it owned, would turn suddenly against the\nRepublic. To terrify vested interests is to conspire against the State.\nThese men who, under pretence of securing universal happiness and the\nreign of justice, proposed a system of equality and community of goods\nas a worthy object of good citizens' endeavours, were traitors and\nmalefactors more dangerous than the Federalists.\n\nBut the most startling revelation he owed to Robespierre's wisdom was\nthat of the crimes and infamies of atheism. Gamelin had never denied the\nexistence of God; he was a deist and believed in a Providence that\nwatches over mankind; but, admitting that he could form only a very\nvague conception of the Supreme Being and deeply attached to the\nprinciple of freedom of conscience, he was quite ready to allow that\nright-thinking men might follow the example of Lamettrie, Boulanger, the\nBaron d'Holbach, Lalande, Helv\u00c3\u00a9tius, the _citoyen_ Dupuis, and deny\nGod's existence, on condition they formulated a natural morality and\nfound in themselves the sources of justice and the rules of a virtuous\nlife. He had even felt himself in sympathy with the atheists, when he\nhad seen them vilified and persecuted. Maximilien had opened his mind\nand unsealed his eyes. The great man by his virtuous eloquence had\ntaught him the true character of atheism, its nature, its objects, its\neffects; he had shown him how this doctrine, conceived in the\ndrawing-rooms and boudoirs of the aristocracy, was the most perfidious\ninvention the enemies of the people had ever devised to demoralize and\nenslave it; how it was a criminal act to uproot from the heart of the\nunfortunate the consoling thought of a Providence to reward and\ncompensate and give them over without rein or bit to the passions that\ndegrade men and make vile slaves of them; how, in fine, the monarchical\nEpicureanism of a Helv\u00c3\u00a9tius led to immorality, cruelty, and every\nwickedness. Now that he had learnt these lessons from the lips of a\ngreat man and a great citizen, he execrated the atheists--especially\nwhen they were of an open-hearted, joyous temper, like his old friend\nBrotteaux.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the days that followed \u00c3\u0089variste had to give judgment one after the\nother on a _ci-devant_ convicted of having destroyed wheat-stuffs in\norder to starve the people, three _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s_ who had returned to foment\ncivil war in France, two ladies of pleasure of the Palais-\u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9,\nfourteen Breton conspirators, men, women, old men, youths, masters, and\nservants. The crime was proven, the law explicit. Among the guilty was a\ngirl of twenty, adorable in the heyday of her young beauty under the\nshadow of the doom so soon to overwhelm her, a fascinating figure. A\nblue bow bound her golden locks, her lawn kerchief revealed a white,\ngraceful neck.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste was consistent in casting his vote for death, and all the\naccused, with the one exception of an old gardener, were sent to the\nscaffold.\n\nThe following week \u00c3\u0089variste and his section mowed down sixty-three\nheads--forty-five men and eighteen women.\n\nThe judges of the Revolutionary Tribunal drew no distinction between men\nand women, in this following a principle as old as justice itself. True,\nthe President Montan\u00c3\u00a9, touched by the bravery and beauty of Charlotte\nCorday, had tried to save her by paltering with the procedure of the\ntrial and had thereby lost his seat, but women as a rule were shown no\nfavour under examination, in strict accordance with the rule common to\nall the tribunals. The jurors feared them, distrusting their artful\nways, their aptitude for deception, their powers of seduction. They were\nthe match of men in resolution, and this invited the Tribunal to treat\nthem in the same way. The majority of those who sat in judgment, men of\nnormal sensuality or sensual on occasion, were in no wise affected by\nthe fact that the prisoner was a woman. They condemned or acquitted them\nas their conscience, their zeal, their love, lukewarm or vehement, for\nthe Republic dictated. Almost always they appeared before the court with\ntheir hair carefully dressed and attired with as much elegance as the\nunhappy conditions allowed. But few of them were young and still fewer\npretty. Confinement and suspense had blighted them, the harsh light of\nthe hall betrayed their weariness and the anguish they had endured,\nbeating down on faded lids, blotched and pimpled cheeks, white, drawn\nlips. Nevertheless, the fatal chair more than once held a young girl,\nlovely in her pallor, while a shadow of the tomb veiled her eyes and\nmade her beauty the more seductive. That the sight had the power to melt\nsome jurymen and irritate others, who should deny? That, in the secret\ndepraved heart of him, one of these magistrates may have pried into the\nmost sacred intimacies of the fair body that was to his morbid fancy at\nthe same moment a living and a dead woman's, and that, gloating over\nvoluptuous and ghoulish imaginings he may have found an atrocious\npleasure in giving over to the headsman those dainty, desirable\nlimbs,--this is perhaps a thing better left unsaid, but one which no one\ncan deem impossible who knows what men are. \u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin, cold and\npedantic in his artistic creed, could see no beauty but in the Antique;\nhe admired beauty, but it hardly stirred his senses. His classical taste\nwas so severe he rarely found a woman to his liking; he was as\ninsensible to the charms of a pretty face as he was to Fragonard's\ncolouring and Boucher's drawing. He had never known desire save under\nthe form of deep passion.\n\nLike the majority of his colleagues in the Tribunal, he thought women\nmore dangerous than men. He hated the _ci-devant_ princesses, the\ncreatures he pictured to himself in his horrified dreams in company with\nElisabeth and _the Austrian_ weaving plots to assassinate good patriots;\nhe even hated all those fair mistresses of financiers, philosophers, and\nmen of letters whose only crime was having enjoyed the pleasures of the\nsenses and the mind and lived at a time when it was sweet to live. He\nhated them without admitting the feeling to himself, and when he had one\nbefore him at the bar, he condemned her out of pique, convinced all the\nwhile that he was dooming her justly and rightly for the public good.\nHis sense of honour, his manly modesty, his cold, calculated wisdom, his\ndevotion to the State, his virtues in a word, pushed under the knife\nheads that might well have moved men's pity.\n\nBut what is this, what is the meaning of this strange prodigy? Once the\ndifficulty was to find the guilty, to search them out in their lair, to\ndrag the confession of their crime from reluctant lips. Now, there is no\nhunting with a great pack of sleuth-hounds, no pursuing a timid prey;\nlo! from all sides come the victims to offer themselves a voluntary\nsacrifice. Nobles, virgins, soldiers, courtesans, flock to the Tribunal,\ndragging their condemnation from dilatory judges, claiming death as a\nright which they are impatient to enjoy. Not enough the multitude with\nwhich the zeal of the informers has crowded the prisons and which the\nPublic Prosecutor and his myrmidons are wearing out their lives in\nhaling before the Tribunal; punishment must likewise be provided for\nthose who refuse to wait. And how many others, prouder and more pressing\nyet, begrudging their judges and headsmen their death, perish by their\nown hand! The mania of killing is equalled by the mania to die. Here, in\nthe Conciergerie, is a young soldier, handsome, vigorous, beloved; he\nleaves behind him in the prison an adorable mistress; she bade him \"Live\nfor me!\"--he will live neither for her nor love nor glory. He lights his\npipe with his act of accusation. And, a Republican, for he breathes\nliberty through every pore, he turns Royalist that he may die. The\nTribunal tries its best to save him, but the accused proves the\nstronger; judges and jury are forced to let him have his way.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste's mind, naturally of an anxious, scrupulous cast, was filled to\noverflowing through the lessons he learned at the Jacobins and the\ncontemplation of life with suspicions and alarms. At night, as he paced\nthe ill-lighted streets on his way to \u00c3\u0089lodie's, he fancied through every\ncellar-grating he passed he caught a glimpse of a plate for printing off\nforged assignats; in the dark recesses of the baker's and grocer's empty\nshops he imagined storerooms bursting with provisions fraudulently held\nback for a rise in prices; looking in at the glittering windows of the\neating-houses, he seemed to hear the talk of the speculators plotting\nthe ruin of the country as they drained bottles of Beaune and Chablis;\nin the evil-smelling alleys he could see the very prostitutes trampling\nunderfoot the National cockade to the applause of elegant young\nroisterers; everywhere he beheld conspirators and traitors. And he\nthought: \"Against so many foes, secret or declared, oh! Republic thou\nhast but one succour; Saint Guillotine, save the fatherland!...\"\n\n\u00c3\u0089lodie would be waiting for him in her little blue chamber above the\n_Amour peintre_. To let him know he might come in, she used to set on\nthe window-sill her little watering-can beside the pot of carnations.\nNow he filled her with horror, he seemed like a monster to her; she was\nafraid of him,--and she adored him. All the night, clinging together in\na frantic embrace, the bloody-minded lover and the amorous girl\nexchanged in silence frenzied kisses.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nRising at dawn, the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, after sweeping out the room,\ndeparted to say his Mass in a chapel in the Rue d'Enfer served by a\nnonjuring priest. There were in Paris thousands of similar retreats,\nwhere the refractory clergy gathered together clandestinely little\ntroops of the faithful. The police of the Sections, vigilant and\nsuspicious as they were, kept their eyes shut to these hidden folds,\nfrom fear of the exasperated flock and moved by some lingering\nveneration for holy things. The Barnabite made his farewells to his host\nwho had great difficulty in persuading him to come back to dine, and\nonly succeeded in the end by promising that the cheer would be neither\nplentiful nor delicate.\n\nBrotteaux, when left to himself, kindled a little earthenware stove;\nthen, while he busied himself with preparations for the Monk's and the\nEpicurean's meal, he read in his Lucretius and meditated on the\nconditions of human beings.\n\nAs a sage and a philosopher, he was not surprised that these wretched\ncreatures, silly playthings of the forces of nature, found themselves\nmore often than not in absurd and painful situations; but he was weak\nand illogical enough to believe that the Revolutionaries were more\nwicked and more foolish than other men, thereby falling into the error\nof the metaphysician. At the same time he was no Pessimist and did not\nhold that life was altogether bad. He admired Nature in several of her\ndepartments, especially the celestial mechanism and physical love, and\naccommodated himself to the labours of life, pending the arrival of the\nday, which could not be far off, when he would have nothing more either\nto fear or to desire.\n\nHe coloured some dancing-dolls with painstaking care and made a Zerline\nthat was very like Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin. He liked the girl and his Epicureanism\nhighly approved of the arrangement of the atoms of which she was\ncomposed.\n\nThese tasks occupied him till the Barnabite's return.\n\n\"Father,\" he announced, as he opened the door to admit him, \"I told you,\nyou remember, that our fare would be meagre. We have nothing but\nchestnuts. The more reason, therefore, they should be well seasoned.\"\n\n\"Chestnuts!\" cried P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, smiling, \"there is no more delicious\ndish. My father, sir, was a poor gentleman of the Limousin, whose whole\nestate consisted of a pigeon-cote in ruins, an orchard run wild and a\nclump of chestnut-trees. He fed himself, his wife and his twelve\nchildren on big green chestnuts, and we were all strong and sturdy. I\nwas the youngest and the most turbulent; my father used to declare, by\nway of jesting, he would have to send me to America to be a\nfilibuster.... Ah! sir, how fragrant your chestnut soup smells! It takes\nme back to the table where my mother sat smiling, surrounded by her\ntroop of little ones.\"\n\nThe repast ended, Brotteaux set out for Joly's, the toy-merchant in the\nRue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs, who took the dancing-dolls Caillou had\nrefused, and ordered--not another gross of them like the latter, but a\nround twenty-four dozen to begin with.\n\nOn reaching the erstwhile Rue Royale and turning into the Place de la\nR\u00c3\u00a9volution, Brotteaux caught sight of a steel triangle glittering\nbetween two wooden uprights; it was the guillotine. An immense crowd of\nlight-hearted spectators pressed round the scaffold, waiting the arrival\nof the loaded carts. Women were hawking Nanterre cakes on a tray hung in\nfront of them and crying their wares; sellers of cooling drinks were\ntinkling their little bells; at the foot of the Statue of Liberty an old\nman had a peep-show in a small booth surmounted by a swing on which a\nmonkey played its antics. Underneath the scaffold some dogs were licking\nyesterday's blood, Brotteaux turned back towards the Rue Honor\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nRegaining his garret, where the Barnabite was reading his breviary, he\ncarefully wiped the table and arranged his colour-box on it alongside\nthe materials and tools of his trade.\n\n\"Father,\" he said, \"if you do not deem the occupation unworthy of the\nsacred character with which you are invested, I will ask you to help me\nmake my marionettes. A worthy tradesman, Joly by name, has this very\nmorning given me a pretty heavy order. Whilst I am painting these\nfigures already put together, you will do me a great service by cutting\nout heads, arms, legs, and bodies from the patterns here. Better you\ncould not find; they are after Watteau and Boucher.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, sir,\" replied Longuemare, \"that Watteau and Boucher\nwere well fitted to create such-like baubles; it had been more to their\nglory if they had confined themselves to innocent figures like these. I\nshould be delighted to help you, but I fear I may not be clever enough\nfor that.\"\n\nThe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare was right to distrust his own skill; after sundry\nunsuccessful attempts, the fact was patent that his genius did not lie\nin the direction of cutting out pretty shapes in thin cardboard with the\npoint of a penknife. But when, at his suggestion, Brotteaux gave him\nsome string and a bodkin, he showed himself very apt in endowing with\nmotion the little creatures he had failed to make and teaching them to\ndance. He had a happy knack, by way of trying them afterwards, of making\nthem each execute three or four steps of a gavotte, and when they\nrewarded his pains, a smile would flicker on his stern lips.\n\nOne time when he was pulling the string of a Scaramouch to a dance tune:\n\n\"Sir,\" he observed, \"this little travesty reminds me of a quaint story.\nIt was in 1746, when I was completing my noviciate under the care of the\nP\u00c3\u00a8re Magitot, a man well on in years, of deep learning and austere\nmorals. At that period, you perhaps remember, dancing figures, intended\nin the first instance to amuse children, exercised over women and even\nover men, both young and old, an extraordinary fascination; they were\nall the rage in Paris. The fashionable shops were crammed with them;\nthey were to be found in the houses of people of quality, and it was\nnothing out of the way to see a grave and reverend senior dancing his\ndoll in the streets and public gardens. The P\u00c3\u00a8re Magitot's age,\ncharacter, and sacred profession did not avail to guard him against\ninfection. Every time he saw anyone busy jumping his cardboard mannikin,\nhis fingers itched with impatience to be at the same game,--an\nimpatience that soon grew well nigh intolerable. One day when he was\npaying a visit of importance on a matter involving the interests of the\nwhole Order to Monsieur Chauvel, advocate in the courts of the\nParlement, noticing one of these dancers hanging from the chimney-piece,\nhe felt a terrible temptation to pull its string, which he only resisted\nat the cost of a tremendous effort. But this frivolous ambition pursued\nhim everywhere and left him no peace. In his studies, in his\nmeditations, in his prayers, at church, at chapter, in the confessional\nand in the pulpit, he was possessed by it. After some days of dreadful\nagony of mind, he laid bare his extraordinary case to the General of the\nOrder, who happened fortunately to be in Paris at the moment. He was an\neminent ecclesiastic of Milan, a Doctor and Prince of the Church. His\ncounsel to the P\u00c3\u00a8re Magitot was to satisfy a craving, innocent in its\ninception, importunate in its consequences and inordinate in its excess,\nwhich threatened to super induce the gravest disorders in the soul which\nwas afflicted with it. On the advice, or more strictly by the order of\nthe General, the P\u00c3\u00a8re Magitot returned to Monsieur Chauvel's house,\nwhere the advocate received him, as on the first occasion, in his\ncabinet. There, finding the dancing figure still fastened in the same\nplace, he ran excitedly to the chimney-piece and begged his host to do\nhim a favour,--to let him pull the string. The lawyer gave him his\npermission very readily, and informed him in confidence that sometimes\nhe set Scaramouch (that was the doll's name) dancing while he was\nstudying his briefs, and that, only the night before, he had modulated\non Scaramouch's movements the peroration of his speech in defence of a\nwoman falsely accused of poisoning her husband. The P\u00c3\u00a8re Magitot seized\nthe string with trembling fingers and saw Scaramouch throw his limbs\nwildly about under his manipulation like one possessed of devils in the\nagonies of exorcism.\"\n\n\"Your tale does not surprise me, father,\" Brotteaux told him, \"We see\nsuch cases of obsession; but it is not always cardboard figures that\noccasion it.\"\n\nThe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, who was religious by profession, never talked about\nreligion, while Brotteaux was for ever harping on the subject. He was\nconscious of a bond of sympathy between himself and the Barnabite, and\ntook a delight in embarrassing and disturbing his peace of mind with\nobjections against divers articles of the Christian faith.\n\nOnce when they were working together making Zerlines and Scaramouches:\n\n\"When I consider,\" remarked Brotteaux, \"the events which have brought us\nto the point at which we stand, I am in doubt as to which party, in the\ngeneral madness, has been the most insane; sometimes, I am greatly\ntempted to believe it was that of the Court.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" answered the Monk, \"all men lose their wits like Nebuchadnezzar,\nwhen God forsakes them; but no man in our days ever plunged so deep in\nignorance and error as the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Fauchet, no man was so fatal as he to\nthe kingdom. God must needs have been sorely exasperated against France\nto send her Monsieur l'Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Fauchet!\"\n\n\"I imagine we have seen other evil-doers besides poor, unhappy Fauchet.\"\n\n\"The Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Gregoire too, was full of malice.\"\n\n\"And Brissot, and Danton, and Marat, and a hundred others, what of them,\nFather?\"\n\n\"Sir, they are laics; the laity could never incur the same\nresponsibilities as the clergy. They do not work evil from so high a\nstandpoint, and their crimes are not of universal bearing.\"\n\n\"And your God, Father, what say you of His behaviour in the present\nRevolution?\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, sir.\"\n\n\"Epicurus said: Either God wishes to hinder evil and cannot, or He can\nand does not wish to, or He cannot nor does he wish to, or He does wish\nto and can. If He wishes to and cannot, He is impotent; if He can and\ndoes not wish to, He is perverse; if He cannot nor does He wish to, He\nis impotent and perverse; if He does wish to and can, why does He not,\ntell me that, Father!\"--and Brotteaux cast a look of triumph at his\ninterlocutor.\n\n\"Sir,\" retorted the Monk, \"there is nothing more contemptible than these\ndifficulties you raise. When I look into the reasoning of infidels, I\nseem to see ants piling up a few blades of grass as a dam against the\ntorrent that sweeps down from the mountains. With your leave, I had\nrather not argue with you; I should have too many excellent reasons and\ntoo few wits to apply them. Besides, you will find your refutation in\nthe Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Gu\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9e and twenty other apologists. I will only say that what\nyou quote from Epicurus is foolishness; because God is arraigned in it\nas if he was a man, with a man's moral code. Well! sir, the sceptics,\nfrom Celsus down to Bayle and Voltaire, have cajoled fools with\nsuch-like paradoxes.\"\n\n\"See, Father,\" protested Brotteaux, \"to what lengths your faith makes\nyou go. Not satisfied with finding all truth in your Theology, you\nlikewise refuse to discover any in the works of so many noble intellects\nwho thought differently from yourselves.\"\n\n\"You are entirely mistaken, sir,\" replied Longuemare. \"On the contrary,\nI believe that nothing could ever be altogether false in a man's\nthoughts. The atheists stand on the lowest rung of the ladder of\nknowledge; but even there, gleams of sense are to be found and flashes\nof truth, and even when darkness is thick about him, a man may lift up\nhis eyes to God, and He will put understanding in his heart; was it not\nso with Lucifer?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Brotteaux, \"I cannot match your generosity and I am\nbound to tell you I cannot find in all the works of the Theologians one\natom of good sense.\"\n\nAt the same time he would repudiate any desire to attack religion, which\nhe deemed indispensable for the nations; he could only wish it had for\nits ministers philosophers instead of controversialists. He deplored the\nfact that the Jacobins were for replacing it by a newer and more\npestilent religion, the cult of liberty, equality, the republic, the\nfatherland. He had observed this, that it is in the vigour of their\nyouth religions are the fiercest and most cruel, and grow milder as they\ngrow older. He was anxious, therefore, to see Catholicism preserved; it\nhad devoured many victims in the times of its vigour, but nowadays,\nburdened by the weight of years and with enfeebled appetite, it was\ncontent with roasting four or five heretics in a hundred years.\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" he concluded, \"I have always got on very well\nwith your God-eaters and Christ-worshippers. I kept a chaplain at Les\nIlettes, where Mass was said every Sunday and all my guests attended.\nThe philosophers were the most devout while the opera girls showed the\nmost fervour. I was prosperous then and had crowds of friends.\"\n\n\"Friends,\" exclaimed the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, \"friends! Ah! sir, do you\nreally think they loved you, all these philosophers and all these\ncourtesans, who have degraded your soul in such wise that God himself\nwould find it hard to know it for one of the temples built by Him for\nHis glory?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare lived for a week longer at the publican's without\nbeing interfered with. As far as possible he observed the discipline of\nhis House and every night at the canonical hours would rise from his\npalliasse to kneel on the bare boards and recite the offices. Though\nboth were reduced to a diet of wretched scraps, he duly observed fasts\nand abstinence. A smiling but pitiful spectator of these austerities,\nBrotteaux one day asked him:\n\n\"Do you really believe that God finds any satisfaction in seeing you\nendure cold and hunger as you do?\"\n\n\"God himself,\" was the Monk's answer, \"has given us the example of\nsuffering.\"\n\nOn the ninth day since the Barnabite had come to share the\nphilosopher's garret, the latter sallied forth at twilight to\ndeliver his dancing-dolls to Joly, the toy-merchant of the Rue\nNeuve-des-Petits-Champs. He was on his way back overjoyed at having sold\nthem all, when, as he was crossing the erstwhile Place du Carrousel, a\ngirl in a blue satin pelisse trimmed with ermine, running by with a\nlimping gait, threw herself into his arms and held him fast in the way\nsuppliants have had since the world began.\n\nShe was trembling and her heart was beating so fast and loud it could be\nplainly heard. Wondering to see one of her common sort look so pathetic,\nBrotteaux, a veteran amateur of the stage, thought how Mademoiselle\nRaucourt, if she could have seen her, might have learnt something from\nher bearing.\n\nShe spoke in breathless tones, lowering her voice to a whisper for fear\nof being overheard by the passers-by:\n\n\"Take me with you, _citoyen_, and hide me, for the love of pity!... They\nare in my room in the Rue Fromenteau. While they were coming upstairs, I\nran for refuge into Flora's room,--she is my next-door neighbour,--and\nleapt out of the window into the street, that is how I sprained my\nankle.... They are coming; they want to put me in prison and kill me....\nLast week they killed Virginie.\"\n\nBrotteaux understood, of course, that the child was speaking of the\ndelegates of the Revolutionary Committee of the Section or else the\nCommissaries of the Committee of General Security. At that time the\nCommune had as _procureur_ a man of virtue, the _citoyen_ Chaumette who\nregarded the ladies of pleasure as the direct foes of the Republic and\nharassed them unmercifully in his efforts to regenerate the Nation's\nmorals. To tell the truth, the young ladies of the Palais-\u00c3\u0089galit\u00c3\u00a9 were\nno great patriots. They regretted the old state of things and did not\nalways conceal the fact. Several had been guillotined already as\nconspirators, and their tragic fate had excited no little emulation\namong their fellows.\n\nThe _citoyen_ Brotteaux asked the suppliant what offence she had been\nguilty of to bring down on herself a warrant of arrest.\n\nShe swore she had no notion, that she had done nothing anyone could\nblame her for.\n\n\"Well then, my girl,\" Brotteaux told her, \"you are not suspect; you have\nnothing to fear. Be off with you to bed and leave me alone.\"\n\nAt this she confessed everything:\n\n\"I tore out my cockade and shouted: 'Vive le roi!'\"\n\nHe walked down to the river-side and she kept by his side along the\ndeserted _quais_. Clinging to his arm she went on:\n\n\"It is not that I care for him particularly, the King, you know; I never\nknew him, and I daresay he wasn't very much different from other men.\nBut they are bad people. They are cruel to poor girls. They torment and\nvex and abuse me in every kind of way; they want to stop me following my\ntrade. I have no other trade. You may be sure, if I had, I should not be\ndoing what I do.... What is it they want? They are so hard on poor\nhumble folks, the milkman, the charcoalman, the water carrier, the\nlaundress. They won't rest content till they've set all poor people\nagainst them.\"\n\nHe looked at her; she seemed a mere child. She was no longer afraid; she\nwas almost smiling, as she limped along lightly at his side. He asked\nher her name. She said she was called Athena\u00c3\u00afs and was sixteen.\n\nBrotteaux offered to see her safe to anywhere she wished to go. She did\nnot know a soul in Paris; but she had an aunt, in service at Palaiseau,\nwho would take her in.\n\nBrotteaux made up his mind at once.\n\n\"Come with me, my child,\" he ordered, and led the way home, with her\nhanging on his arm.\n\nOn his arrival, he found the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare in the garret reading his\nbreviary.\n\nHolding Athena\u00c3\u00afs by the hand, he drew the other's attention to her:\n\n\"Father,\" he said, \"here is a girl from the Rue Fromenteau who has been\nshouting: 'Vive le roi!' The revolutionary police are on her track. She\nhas nowhere to lay head. Will you allow the girl to pass the night\nhere?\"\n\nThe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare closed his breviary.\n\n\"If I understand you right,\" he said, \"you ask me, sir, if this young\ngirl, who is like myself subject to be molested under a warrant of\narrest, may be suffered, for her temporal salvation, to spend the night\nin the same room as I?\"\n\n\"Yes, Father.\"\n\n\"By what right should I object? and why must I suppose myself affronted\nby her presence? am I so sure that I am any better than she?\"\n\nHe established himself for the night in an old broken-down armchair,\ndeclaring he should sleep excellently in it. Athena\u00c3\u00afs lay on the\nmattress. Brotteaux stretched himself on the palliasse and blew out the\ncandle.\n\nThe hours and half-hours sounded one after the other from the church\ntowers, but the old man could not sleep; he lay awake listening to the\nmingled breathing of the man of religion and the girl of pleasure. The\nmoon rose, symbol and witness of his old-time loves, and threw a silvery\nray into the attic, illuminating the fair hair and golden lashes, the\ndelicate nose and round, red mouth of Athena\u00c3\u00afs, who lay sound asleep.\n\n\"Truly,\" he thought to himself, \"a terrible enemy for the Republic!\"\n\nWhen Athena\u00c3\u00afs awoke, the day was breaking. The Monk had disappeared.\nBrotteaux was reading Lucretius under the skylight, learning from the\nmaxims of the Latin poet to live without fears and without desires; but\nfor all this he felt himself at the moment devoured with regrets and\ndisquietudes.\n\nOpening her eyes, Athena\u00c3\u00afs was dumfounded to see the roof beams of a\ngarret above her head. Then she remembered, smiled at her preserver and\nextended towards him with a caressing gesture her pretty little dirty\nhands.\n\nRising on her elbow, she pointed to the dilapidated armchair in which\nthe Monk had passed the night.\n\n\"He is not there?... He has not gone to denounce me, has he?\"\n\n\"No, no, my child. You could not find a more honest soul than that old\nmadman.\"\n\nAthena\u00c3\u00afs asked in what the old fellow's madness consisted; and when\nBrotteaux informed her it was religion, she gravely reproached him for\nspeaking so, declaring that men without faith were worse than the beasts\nthat perish and that for her part she often prayed to God, hoping He\nwould forgive her her sins and receive her in His blessed mercy.\n\nThen, noticing that Brotteaux held a book in his hand, she thought it\nwas a book of the Mass and said:\n\n\"There you see, you too, you say your prayers! God will reward you for\nwhat you have done for me.\"\n\nBrotteaux having told her that it was not a Mass-book, and that it had\nbeen written before ever the Mass had been invented in the world, she\nopined it was an _Interpretation of Dreams_, and asked if it did not\ncontain an explanation of an extraordinary dream she had had. She could\nnot read and these were the only two sorts of books she had heard tell\nof.\n\nBrotteaux informed her that this book was only by way of explaining the\ndream of life. Finding this a hard saying, the pretty child did not try\nto understand it and dipped the end of her nose in the earthenware crock\nthat replaced the silver basins Brotteaux had once been accustomed to\nuse. Next, she arranged her hair before her host's shaving-glass with\nscrupulous care and gravity. Her white arms raised above her head, she\nlet fall an observation from time to time with long intervals between:\n\n\"You, you were rich once.\"\n\n\"What makes you think that?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But you _were_ rich,--and you are an aristocrat, I am\ncertain of it.\"\n\nShe drew from her pocket a little Holy Virgin of silver in a round ivory\nshrine, a bit of sugar, thread, scissors, a flint and steel, two or\nthree cases for needles and the like, and after selecting what she\nrequired, sat down to mend her skirt, which had got torn in several\nplaces.\n\n\"For your own safety, my child, put this in your cap!\" Brotteaux bade\nher, handing her a tricolour cockade.\n\n\"I will do that gladly, sir,\" she agreed, \"but it will be for the love\nof you and not for love of the Nation.\"\n\nWhen she was dressed and had made herself look her best, taking her\nskirt in both hands, she dropped a curtsey as she had been taught to do\nin her village, and addressing Brotteaux:\n\n\"Sir,\" she said, \"I am your very humble servant.\"\n\nShe was prepared to oblige her benefactor in all ways he might wish,\nbut she thought it more becoming that he asked for no favour and she\noffered none; it seemed to her a pretty way to part so, and what good\nmanners required.\n\nBrotteaux slipped a few assignats into her hand to pay her coach-hire to\nPalaiseau. It was the half of his fortune, and, albeit he was notorious\nfor his lavishness towards women, it was the first time he had ever made\nso equal a partition of his goods with any of the sex.\n\nShe asked him his name.\n\n\"I am called Maurice.\"\n\nIt was with reluctance he opened the garret door for her:\n\n\"Good-bye, Athena\u00c3\u00afs.\"\n\nShe kissed him. \"Monsieur Maurice,\" she said, \"when you think of me, if\never you do, call me Marthe; that is the name I was christened, the name\nthey called me by in the village.... Good-bye and thank you.... Your\nvery humble servant, Monsieur Maurice.\"\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nThe prisons were full to bursting and must be emptied; the work of\njudging, judging, must go on without truce or respite. Seated against\nthe tapestried walls with their fasces and red caps of liberty, like\ntheir fellows of the fleurs-de-lis, the judges preserved the same\ngravity, the same dreadful calm, as their Royal predecessors. The Public\nProsecutor and his Deputies, worn out with fatigue, consumed with the\nfever of sleeplessness and brandy, could only shake off their exhaustion\nby a violent effort; their broken health made them tragic figures to\nlook upon. The jurors, divers in character and origin, some educated,\nothers ignorant, craven or generous, gentle or violent, hypocritical or\nsincere, but all men who, knowing the fatherland and the Republic in\ndanger, suffered or feigned to suffer the same anguish, to burn with the\nsame ardour; all alike primed to atrocities of virtue or of fear, they\nformed but one living entity, one single head, dull and irritable, one\nsingle soul, a beast of the apocalypse that by the mere exercise of its\nnatural functions produced a teeming brood of death. Kind-hearted or\ncruel by caprice of sensibility, when shaken momentarily by a sudden\npang of pity, they would acquit with streaming eyes a prisoner whom an\nhour before they would have condemned to the guillotine with taunts. The\nfurther they proceeded with their task, the more impetuously did they\nfollow the impulses of their heart.\n\nJudge and jury toiled, fevered and half asleep with overwork, distracted\nby the excitement outside and the orders of the sovereign people,\nmenaced by the threats of the _sansculottes_ and _tricoteuses_ who\ncrowded the galleries and the public enclosure, relying on insane\nevidence, acting on the denunciations of madmen, in a poisonous\natmosphere that stupefied the brain, set ears hammering and temples\nbeating and darkened the eyes with a veil of blood. Vague rumours were\ncurrent among the public of jurors bought by the gold of the accused.\nBut to these the jury as a body replied with indignant protest and\nmerciless condemnations. In truth they were men neither worse nor better\nthan their fellows. Innocence more often than not is a piece of good\nfortune rather than a virtue; any other who should have consented to put\nhimself in their place would have acted as they did and accomplished to\nthe best of his commonplace soul these appalling tasks.\n\nAntoinette, so long expected, sat at last in the fatal chair, in a black\ngown, the centre of such a concentration of hate that only the certainty\nof what the sentence would be made the court observe the forms of law.\nTo the deadly questions the accused replied sometimes with the instinct\nof self-preservation, sometimes with her wonted haughtiness, and once,\nthanks to the hideous suggestion of one of her accusers, with the noble\ndignity of a mother. The witnesses were confined to outrage and calumny;\nthe defence was frozen with terror. The tribunal, forcing itself to\nrespect the rules of procedure, was only waiting till all formalities\nwere completed to hurl the head of _the Austrian_ in the face of\nEurope.\n\nThree days after the execution of Marie Antoinette Gamelin was called to\nthe bedside of the _citoyen_ Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 Trubert, who lay dying, within\nthirty paces of the Military Bureau where he had worn out his life, on a\npallet of sacking, in the cell of some expelled Barnabite father. His\nlivid face was sunk in the pillow. His eyes, which already were almost\nsightless, turned their glassy pupils upon his visitor; his parched hand\ngrasped \u00c3\u0089variste's and pressed it with unexpected vigour. Three times he\nhad vomited blood in two days. He tried to speak; his voice, at first\nhoarse and feeble as a whisper, grew louder, deeper:\n\n\"Wattignies! Wattignies!... Jourdan has forced the enemy into their camp\n... raised the blockade at Maubeuge.... We have retaken Marchiennes, _\u00c3\u00a7a\nira_ ... _\u00c3\u00a7a ira_ ...\" and he smiled.\n\nThese were no dreams of a sick man, but a clear vision of the truth that\nflashed through the brain so soon to be shrouded in eternal darkness.\nHereafter the invasion seemed arrested; the Generals were terrorized and\nsaw that the one best thing for them to do was to be victorious. Where\nvoluntary recruiting had failed to produce what was needed, a strong and\ndisciplined army, compulsion was succeeding. One effort more, and the\nRepublic would be saved.\n\nAfter a half hour of semi-consciousness, Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 Trubert's face,\nhollow-cheeked and worn by disease, lit up again and his hands moved.\n\nHe lifted his finger and pointed to the only piece of furniture in the\nroom, a little walnut-wood writing-desk. The voice was weak and\nbreathless, but the mind quite unclouded:\n\n\"Like Eudamidas,\" he said, \"I bequeath my debts to my friend,--three\nhundred and twenty livres, of which you will find the account ... in\nthat red book yonder ... good-bye, Gamelin. Never rest; wake and watch\nover the defence of the Republic. _\u00c3\u0087a ira._\"\n\nThe shades of night were deepening in the cell. The difficult breathing\nof the dying man was the only sound, and his hands scratching on the\nsheet.\n\nAt midnight he uttered some disconnected phrases:\n\n\"More saltpetre.... See the muskets are delivered. Health? Oh!\nexcellent.... Get down the church-bells....\"\n\nHe breathed his last at five in the morning.\n\nBy order of the Section his body lay in state in the nave of the\nerstwhile church of the Barnabites, at the foot of the Altar of the\nFatherland, on a camp bed, covered with a tricolour flag and the brow\nwreathed with an oak crown.\n\nTwelve old men clad in the Roman toga, with palms in their hands, twelve\nyoung girls wearing long veils and carrying flowers, surrounded the\nfuneral couch. At the dead man's feet stood two children, each holding\nan inverted torch. One of them \u00c3\u0089variste recognized as his _concierge's_\nlittle daughter Jos\u00c3\u00a9phine, who in her childish gravity and beauty\nreminded him of those charming genii of Love and Death the Romans used\nto sculpture on their tombs.\n\nThe funeral procession made its way to the Cemetery of\nSaint-Andr\u00c3\u00a9-des-Arts to the strains of the _Marseillaise_ and the\n_\u00c3\u0087a-ira_.\n\nAs he laid the kiss of farewell on Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 Trubert's brow, \u00c3\u0089variste\nwept. His tears flowed in self-pity, for he envied his friend who was\nresting there, his task accomplished.\n\nOn reaching home, he received notice that he was posted a member of the\nCouncil General of the Commune. After standing as candidate for four\nmonths, he had been elected unopposed, after several ballots, by some\nthirty suffrages. No one voted nowadays; the Sections were deserted;\nrich and poor alike only sought to shirk the performance of public\nduties. The most momentous events had ceased to rouse either enthusiasm\nor curiosity; the newspapers were left unread. Out of the seven hundred\nthousand inhabitants of the capital \u00c3\u0089variste doubted if as many as three\nor four thousand still preserved the old Republican spirit.\n\nThe same day the Twenty-one came up for trial. Innocent or guilty of the\ncalamities and crimes of the Republic, vain, incautious, ambitious and\nimpetuous, at once moderate and violent, feeble in their fear as in\ntheir clemency, quick to declare war, slow to carry it out, haled before\nthe Tribunal to answer for the example they had given, they were not the\nless the first and the most brilliant children of the Revolution, whose\ndelight and glory they had been. The judge who will question them with\nartful bias; the pallid accuser yonder who, where he sits behind his\nlittle table, is planning their death and dishonour; the jurors who will\npresently try to stifle their defence; the public in the galleries which\noverwhelms them with howls of insult and abuse,--all, judge, jury,\npeople, have applauded their eloquence in other days, extolled their\ntalents and their virtues. But judge, jury, people have short memories\nnow.\n\nOnce \u00c3\u0089variste had made Vergniaud his god, Brissot his oracle. But he\nhad forgotten; if any vestige of his old wonder still lingered in his\nmemory, it was to think that these monsters had seduced the noblest\ncitizens.\n\nReturning to his lodging after the sitting, Gamelin heard heart-breaking\ncries as he entered the house. It was little Jos\u00c3\u00a9phine; her mother was\nwhipping her for playing in the Place with good-for-nothing boys and\ndirtying the fine white frock she had worn for the obsequies of the\n_citoyen_ Trubert.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nAfter three months during which he had made a daily holocaust of\nvictims, illustrious or insignificant, to the fatherland, \u00c3\u0089variste had a\ncase that interested him personally; there was one prisoner he made it\nhis special business to track down to death.\n\nEver since he had sat on the juror's bench, he had been eagerly\nwatching, among the crowd of culprits who appeared before him, for\n\u00c3\u0089lodie's seducer; of this man he had elaborated in his busy fancy a\nportrait, some details of which were accurate. He pictured him as young,\nhandsome, haughty, and felt convinced he had fled to England. He thought\nhe had discovered him in a young _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_ named Maubel, who, having come\nback to France and been denounced by his host, had been arrested in an\ninn at Passy; Fouquier-Tinville was in charge of the prosecution,--among\na thousand others. Letters had been found on him which the accusation\nregarded as proofs of a plot concocted between Maubel and the agents of\nPitt, but which were in fact only letters written to the _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_ by a\nbanking-house in London which he had entrusted with certain funds.\nMaubel, who was young and good-looking, seemed to be mainly occupied in\naffairs of gallantry. His pocket-book afforded a clue to some\ncorrespondence with Spain, then at war with France; but these\ncommunications were really of a purely private nature, and if the court\nof preliminary enquiry did not ignore the bill, it was only in virtue of\nthe maxim that justice should never be in too great a hurry to release a\nprisoner.\n\nGamelin was handed a report of Maubel's first semi-private examination\nand he was struck by what it revealed of the young man's character,\nwhich he took to agree with what he believed to be that of \u00c3\u0089lodie's\nbetrayer. Thereafter he spent long hours in the private room of the\nClerk of the Court, poring eagerly over the papers relating to this\ncase. His suspicion received a remarkable confirmation on his\ndiscovering in a note-book belonging to the _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_, but long out of\ndate, the address of the _Amour peintre_, in company, it is true, with\nthose of the _Green Monkey_, the _Dauphin's Head_, and several more\nprint and picture shops. But when he was informed that in this same\nnote-book had been found three or four petals of a red carnation\ncarefully wrapped in a piece of silk paper, remembering how the red\ncarnation was \u00c3\u0089lodie's favourite flower, the one she cultivated on her\nwindow-sill, wore in her hair and used to give (he had reason to know)\nas a love-token, \u00c3\u0089variste's last doubts vanished. Being now convinced he\nknew the facts, he resolved to question \u00c3\u0089lodie, though without letting\nher know the circumstances that had led him to discover the culprit.\n\nAs he was climbing the stairs to his lodgings, he perceived even on the\nlower landings a stifling smell of fruit, and on reaching the studio,\nfound \u00c3\u0089lodie helping the _citoyenne_ Gamelin to make quince preserve.\nWhile the old housewife was kindling the stove and turning over in her\nmind ways of saving the fuel and moist sugar without prejudicing the\nquality of the preserves, the _citoyenne_ Blaise, seated in a\nstraw-bottomed chair, with an apron of brown holland and her lap full of\nthe golden fruit, was peeling the quinces, quartering and throwing them\ninto a shallow copper basin. The strings of her coif were thrown back\nover her shoulders, the meshes of her black hair coiled above her moist\nforehead; from her whole person breathed a domestic charm and an\nintimate grace that induced gentle thoughts and voluptuous dreams of\ntranquil pleasures.\n\nWithout stirring from her seat, she lifted her beautiful eyes, that\ngleamed like molten gold, to her lover's face, and said:\n\n\"See, \u00c3\u0089variste, we are working for you. We mean you to have a store of\ndelicious quince jelly to last you the winter; it will settle your\nstomach and make your heart merry.\"\n\nBut Gamelin, stepping nearer, uttered a name in her ear:\n\n\"Jacques Maubel....\"\n\nAt that moment Combalot the cobbler showed his red nose at the half-open\ndoor. He had brought, along with some pairs of shoes he had re-heeled,\nthe bill for the repairs.\n\nFor fear of being taken for a bad citizen, he made a point of using the\nnew calendar. The _citoyenne_ Gamelin, who liked to see clearly what was\nwhat in her accounts, was all astray among the _Fructidors_ and\n_Vend\u00c3\u00a9miaires_. She heaved a sigh.\n\n\"Jesus!\" she complained, \"they want to alter everything,--days, months,\nseasons of the year, the sun and the moon! Lord God, Monsieur Combalot,\nwhat ever is this pair of over-shoes down for the 8 Vend\u00c3\u00a9miaire?\"\n\n\"_Citoyenne_, just cast your eye over your almanac, and you'll get the\nhang of it.\"\n\nShe took it down from the wall, glanced at it and immediately turning\nher head another way.\n\n\"It hasn't a Christian look!\" she cried in a shocked tone.\n\n\"Not only that, _citoyenne_,\" said the cobbler, \"but now we have only\nthree Sundays in the month instead of four. And that's not all; we shall\nsoon have to change our ways of reckoning. There will be no more\nfarthings and half-farthings, everything will be regulated by distilled\nwater.\"\n\nAt the words the _citoyenne_ Gamelin, whose lips were trembling, threw\nup her eyes to the ceiling and sighed out:\n\n\"They are going too far!\"\n\nAnd, while she was lost in lamentations, looking like the holy women in\na wayside calvary, a bad coal that had caught alight in the fire when\nher attention was diverted, began to fill the studio with a poisonous\nsmother which, added to the stifling smell of quinces, was like to make\nthe air unbreathable.\n\n\u00c3\u0089lodie complained that her throat was tickling her and begged to have\nthe window opened. But, directly the _citoyen_ Combalot had taken his\nleave and the _citoyenne_ Gamelin had gone back to her stove, \u00c3\u0089variste\nrepeated the same name in the girl's ear:\n\n\"Jacques Maubel,\" he reiterated.\n\nShe looked up at him in some surprise, and very quietly, still going on\ncutting a quince in quarters:\n\n\"Well!... Jacques Maubel...?\"\n\n\"He is the man.\"\n\n\"The man! what man?\"\n\n\"You once gave him a red carnation.\"\n\nShe declared she did not understand and asked him to explain himself.\n\n\"That aristocrat! that _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_! that scoundrel!\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, and denied with the most natural air that\nshe had never known a Jacques Maubel.\n\nIt was true; she _had_ never known anyone of the name.\n\nShe denied she had ever given red carnations to anybody but \u00c3\u0089variste;\nbut perhaps, on this point, her memory was not very good.\n\nHe had little experience of women and was far from having fully fathomed\n\u00c3\u0089lodie's character; still, he deemed her quite capable of cajoling and\ndeceiving a cleverer man than himself.\n\n\"Why deny?\" he asked. \"I know all.\"\n\nAgain she asseverated she had never known anybody called Maubel. And,\nhaving done peeling the quinces, she asked for a basin of water, because\nher fingers were sticky. This Gamelin brought her, and, as she washed\nher hands, she repeated her denials.\n\nAgain he repeated that he knew, and this time she made no reply.\n\nShe did not guess the object of her lover's question and she was a\nthousand miles from suspecting that this Maubel, whom she had never\nheard spoken of before, was to appear before the Revolutionary Tribunal;\nshe could make nothing of the suspicions with which she was assailed,\nbut she knew them to be unfounded. For this reason, having very little\nhope of dissipating them, she had very little wish to do so either. She\nceased to deny having known Maubel, preferring to leave her jealous\nlover to go astray on a false trail, when from one moment to the next,\nthe smallest incident might start him on the right road. Her little\nlawyer's clerk of former days, now grown into a patriot dragoon and\nlady-killer, had quarrelled by now with his aristocratic mistress.\nWhenever he met \u00c3\u0089lodie in the street, he would gaze at her with a glance\nthat seemed to say:\n\n\"Come, my beauty! I feel sure I am going to forgive you for having\nbetrayed you, and I am really quite ready to take you back into favour.\"\nShe made no further attempt therefore to cure what she called her\nlover's crotchets, and Gamelin remained firm in the conviction that\nJacques Maubel was \u00c3\u0089lodie's seducer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThrough the days that ensued the Tribunal devoted its undivided\nattention to the task of crushing Federalism, which, like a hydra, had\nthreatened to devour Liberty. They were busy days; and the jurors, worn\nout with fatigue, despatched with the utmost possible expedition the\ncase of the woman Roland, instigator and accomplice of the crimes of the\nBrissotin faction.\n\nMeantime Gamelin spent every morning at the Courts to press on Maubel's\ntrial. Some important pieces of evidence were to be found at Bordeaux;\nhe insisted on a Commissioner being sent to ride post to fetch them.\nThey arrived at last. The deputy of the Public Prosecutor read them,\npulled a face and told \u00c3\u0089variste:\n\n\"It is not good for much, your new evidence! there is nothing in it!\nmere fiddle-faddle.... If only it was certain that this _ci-devant_\nComte de Maubel ever really emigrated...!\"\n\nIn the end Gamelin succeeded. Young Maubel was served with his act of\naccusation and brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal on the 19\nBrumaire.\n\nFrom the first opening of the sitting the President showed the gloomy\nand dreadful face he took care to assume for the hearing of cases where\nthe evidence was weak. The Deputy Prosecutor stroked his chin with the\nfeather of his pen and affected the serenity of a conscience at ease.\nThe Clerk read the act of accusation; it was the hollowest sham the\nCourt had ever heard so far.\n\nThe President asked the accused if he had not been aware of the laws\npassed against the _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s_.\n\n\"I was aware of them and I observed them,\" answered Maubel, \"and I left\nFrance provided with passports in proper form.\"\n\nAs to the reasons for his journey to England and his return to France he\nhad satisfactory explanations to offer. His face was pleasant, with a\nlook of frankness and confidence that was agreeable. The women in the\ngalleries looked at the young man with a favourable eye. The prosecution\nmaintained that he had made a stay in Spain at the time that Nation was\nat war with France; he averred he had never left Bayonne at that period.\nOne point alone remained obscure. Among the papers he had thrown in the\nfire at the time of his arrest, and of which only fragments had been\nfound, some words in Spanish had been deciphered and the name of\n\"Nieves.\"\n\nOn this subject Jacques Maubel refused to give the explanations\ndemanded; and, when the President told him that it was in the accused's\nown interest to clear up the point, he answered that a man ought not\nalways to do what his own interest requires.\n\nGamelin only thought of convicting Maubel of a crime; three times over\nhe pressed the President to ask the accused if he could explain about\nthe carnation the dried petals of which he hoarded so carefully in his\npocket-book.\n\nMaubel replied that he did not consider himself obliged to answer a\nquestion that had no concern with the case at law, as no letter had been\nfound concealed in the flower.\n\nThe jury retired to the hall of deliberations, favourably impressed\ntowards the young man whose mysterious conduct appeared chiefly\nconnected with a lover's secrets. This time the good patriots, the\npurest of the pure themselves, would gladly have voted for acquittal.\nOne of them, a _ci-devant_ noble, who had given pledges to the\nRevolution, said:\n\n\"Is it his birth they bring up against him? I, too, I have had the\nmisfortune to be born in the aristocracy.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you have left them,\" retorted Gamelin, \"and he has not.\"\n\nAnd he spoke with such vehemence against this conspirator, this emissary\nof Pitt, this accomplice of Coburg, who had climbed the mountains and\nsailed the seas to stir up enemies to Liberty, he demanded the traitor's\ncondemnation in such burning words, that he awoke the never-resting\nsuspicions, the old stern temper of the patriot jury.\n\nOne of them told him cynically:\n\n\"There are services that cannot well be refused between colleagues.\"\n\nThe verdict of death was recorded by a majority of one.\n\nThe condemned man heard his sentence with a quiet smile. His eyes, which\nhad been gazing unconcernedly about the hall, as they fell on Gamelin's\nface, took on an expression of unspeakable contempt.\n\nNo one applauded the decision of the court.\n\nJacques Maubel was taken back to the Conciergerie; here he wrote a\nletter while he waited the hour of execution, which was to take place\nthe same evening, by torchlight:\n\n     _My dear sister,--The tribunal sends me to the scaffold, affording\n     me the only joy I have been able to appreciate since the death of\n     my adored Nieves. They have taken from me the only relic I had left\n     of her, a pomegranate flower, which they called, I cannot tell why,\n     a carnation.\n\n     I loved the arts; at Paris, in happier times, I made a collection\n     of paintings and engravings, which are now in a sure place, and\n     which will be delivered to you so soon as this is possible. I pray\n     you, dear sister, to keep them in memory of me._\n\nHe cut a lock of his hair, enclosed it in the letter, which he folded\nand wrote outside:\n\n_To the citoyenne Cl\u00c3\u00a9mence Dezeimeries, n\u00c3\u00a9e Maubel,\n\nLa R\u00c3\u00a9ole._\n\nHe gave all the silver he had on him to the turnkey, begging him to\nforward this letter to its destination, asked for a bottle of wine,\nwhich he drank in little sips while waiting for the cart....\n\nAfter supper Gamelin ran to the _Amour Peintre_ and burst into the blue\nchamber where every night \u00c3\u0089lodie was waiting for him.\n\n\"You are avenged,\" he told her. \"Jacques Maubel is no more. The cart\nthat took him to his death has just passed beneath your window, escorted\nby torch-bearers.\"\n\nShe understood:\n\n\"Wretch! it is you have killed him, and he was not my lover. I did not\nknow him.... I have never seen him.... What was this man? He was young,\namiable ... innocent. And you have killed him, wretch! wretch!\"\n\nShe fell in a faint. But, amid the shadows of this momentary death, she\nfelt herself overborne by a flood at once of horror and voluptuous\necstasy. She half revived; her heavy lids lifted to show the whites of\nthe eyes, her bosom swelled, her hands beat the air, seeking for her\nlover. She pressed him to her in a strangling embrace, drove her nails\ninto the flesh, and gave him with her bleeding lips, without a word,\nwithout a sound, the longest, the most agonized, the most delicious of\nkisses.\n\nShe loved him with all her flesh, and the more terrible, cruel,\natrocious she thought him, the more she saw him reeking with the blood\nof his victims, the more consuming was her hunger and thirst for him.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nThe 24 Frimaire, at ten in the forenoon, under a clear bright sun that\nwas melting the ice formed in the night, the _citoyens_ Gu\u00c3\u00a9not and\nDelourmel, delegates of the Committee of General Security, proceeded to\nthe Barnabites and asked to be conducted to the Committee of\nSurveillance of the Section, in the Capitular hall, whose only occupant\nfor the moment was the _citoyen_ Beauvisage, who was piling logs on the\nfire. But they did not see him just at first because of his short,\nthickset stature.\n\nIn a hunchback's cracked voice the _citoyen_ Beauvisage begged the\ndelegates to seat themselves and put himself entirely at their service.\n\nGu\u00c3\u00a9not then asked him if he knew a _ci-devant_ Monsieur des Ilettes,\nresiding near the Pont-Neuf.\n\n\"It is an individual,\" he added, \"whose arrest I am instructed to\neffect,\"--and he exhibited the order from the Committee of General\nSecurity.\n\nBeauvisage, after racking his memory for a while, replied that he knew\nno individual of that name, that the suspect in question might not be an\ninhabitant of his Section, certain portions of the _Sections du Mus\u00c3\u00a9um_,\n_de l'Unit\u00c3\u00a9_, _de Marat-et-Marseille_ being likewise in the near\nneighbourhood of the Pont-Neuf; that, if he did live in the Section, it\nmust be under another name than that borne on the Committee's order;\nthat, nevertheless, it would not be long before they laid hands on him.\n\n\"Let's lose no time,\" urged Gu\u00c3\u00a9not. \"Our vigilance was aroused in this\ncase by a letter from one of the man's accomplices that was intercepted\nand put into the hands of the Committee a fortnight ago, but which the\n_citoyen_ Lacroix took action upon only yesterday evening. We are\noverdone with business; denunciations flow in from every quarter in such\nabundance one does not know which to attend to.\"\n\n\"Denunciations,\" replied Beauvisage proudly, \"are coming in freely, too,\nto the Committee of Vigilance of our Section. Some make these\nrevelations out of patriotism, others lured by the bait of a bank-bill\nfor a hundred _sols_. Many children denounce their parents, whose\nproperty they covet.\"\n\n\"This letter,\" resumed Gu\u00c3\u00a9not, \"emanates from a _ci-devant_ called\nRochemaure, a woman of gallantry, at whose house they played _biribi_,\nand is addressed to one _citoyen_ Rauline; but is really for an _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_\nin the service of Pitt. I have brought it with me to communicate to you\nthe portion relating to this man des Ilettes.\"\n\nHe drew the letter from his pocket.\n\n\"It begins with copious details as to those members of the Convention\nwho might, according to the woman's tale, be gained over by the offer of\na sum of money or the promise of a well-paid post under a new\nGovernment, more stable than the present. Then comes the following\npassage:\n\n     _\"I have just returned from a visit to Monsieur des Ilettes, who\n     lives near the Pont-Neuf in a garret where you must be either a cat\n     or an imp to get at him; he is reduced to earning a living by\n     making punch-and-judies. He is a man of judgment, for which reason\n     I report to you, sir, the main gist of his conversation. He does\n     not believe that the existing state of things will last long. Nor\n     does he foresee its being ended by the victory of the coalition,\n     and events appear to justify his opinion; for, as you are aware,\n     sir, for some time past tidings from the front have been bad. He\n     would rather seem to believe in the revolt of the poor and the\n     women of the humbler classes, who remain still deeply attached to\n     their religion. He holds that the widespread alarm caused by the\n     Revolutionary Tribunal will soon reunite all France against the\n     Jacobins. 'This tribunal,' he said, in his joking way, 'which\n     sentences the Queen of France and a bread-hawker, is like that\n     William Shakespeare the English admire so much, etc....' He thinks\n     it not impossible that Robespierre may marry Madame Royale and have\n     himself named Protector of the Kingdom.\n\n     \"I should be grateful to you, sir, if you would transmit me the\n     amount owing to me, that is to say one thousand pounds sterling, by\n     the channel you are in the habit of using; but whatever you do, do\n     not write to Monsieur Morhardt; he has lately been arrested, thrown\n     into prison, etc., etc....\"_\n\n\"This worthy des Ilettes makes dancing-dolls, it appears,\" observed\nBeauvisage, \"that is a valuable clue ... though certainly there are many\npetty trades of the sort carried on in the Section.\"\n\n\"That reminds me,\" said Delourmel, \"I promised to bring home a doll for\nmy little girl Nathalie, my youngest, who is ill with scarlatina. The\nfever is not a dangerous one, but it demands careful nursing, and\nNathalie, a very forward child for her age, and with a very active\nbrain, has but delicate health.\"\n\n\"I,\" remarked Gu\u00c3\u00a9not, \"I have only a boy. He plays hoop with\nbarrel-hoops and makes little montgolfier balloons by inflating paper\nbags.\"\n\n\"Very often,\" Beauvisage put in his word, \"it is with articles that are\nnot toys at all that children like best to play. My nephew \u00c3\u0089mile, a\nlittle chap of seven, a very intelligent child, amuses himself all day\nlong with little wooden bricks with which he builds houses.... Do you\nsnuff, _citoyens_?\"--and Beauvisage held out his open snuff-box to the\ntwo delegates.\n\n\"Now we must set about nabbing our rascal,\" said Delourmel, who had long\nmoustaches and great eyes that rolled in his head. \"I feel quite in the\nmood this morning for a dish of aristocrat's lights and liver, washed\ndown with a glass of white wine.\"\n\nBeauvisage suggested to the delegates going to the Place Dauphine to see\nif his colleague Dupont senior was at his shop there; he would be sure\nto know this man, des Ilettes.\n\nSo they set off in the keen morning air, accompanied by four grenadiers\nof the Section.\n\n\"Have you seen '_The Last Judgment of Kings_' played?\" Delourmel asked\nhis companions; \"the piece is worth seeing. The author shows you all the\nKings of Europe on a desert island where they have taken refuge, at the\nfoot of a volcano which swallows them up. It is a patriotic work.\"\n\nAt the corner of the Rue du Harlay Delourmel's eye was caught by a\nlittle cart, as brilliantly painted as a reliquary, which an old woman\nwas pushing, wearing over her coif a hat of waxed cloth.\n\n\"What is that old woman selling?\" he asked.\n\nThe old dame answered for herself:\n\n\"Look, gentlemen, make your choice. I have beads and rosaries, crosses,\nSt. Anthonys, holy cerecloths, St. Veronica handkerchiefs, _Ecce homos_,\n_Agnus Deis_, hunting-horns and rings of St. Hubert, and articles of\ndevotion of every sort and kind.\"\n\n\"Why, it is the very arsenal of fanaticism!\" cried Delourmel in\nhorror,--and he proceeded to a summary examination of the poor woman,\nwho made the same answer to every question:\n\n\"My son, it's forty years I have been selling articles of devotion.\"\n\nAnother Delegate of the Committee of General Security, noticing a\nblue-coated National Guard passing, directed him to convey the\nastonished old woman to the Conciergerie.\n\nThe _citoyen_ Beauvisage pointed out to Delourmel that it would have\nbeen more in the competence of the Committee of Surveillance to arrest\nthe woman and bring her before the Section; that in any case, one never\nknew nowadays what attitude to take up towards the old religion so as to\nact up to the views of the Government, and whether it was best to allow\neverything or forbid everything.\n\nOn nearing the joiner's shop, the delegates and the commissary could\nhear angry shouts mingling with the hissing of the saw and the grinding\nof the plane. A quarrel had broken out between the joiner, Dupont\nsenior, and his neighbour Remacle, the porter, because of the\n_citoyenne_ Remacle, whom an irresistible attraction was for ever\ndrawing into the recesses of the workshop, whence she would return to\nthe porter's lodge all covered with shavings and saw-dust. The injured\nporter bestowed a kick on Mouton, the carpenter's dog, which at that\nvery moment his own little daughter Jos\u00c3\u00a9phine was nursing lovingly in\nher arms. Jos\u00c3\u00a9phine was furious and burst into a torrent of imprecations\nagainst her father, while the carpenter shouted in a voice of\nexasperation:\n\n\"Wretch! I tell you you shall not beat my dog.\"\n\n\"And I,\" retorted the porter brandishing his broom, \"I tell you you\nshall _not_....\"\n\nHe did not finish the sentence; the joiner's plane had hurtled close\npast his head.\n\nThe instant he caught sight of the _citoyen_ Beauvisage and the\nattendant delegates, he rushed up to him and cried:\n\n\"_Citoyen_ Commissary you are my witness, this villain has just tried to\nmurder me.\"\n\nThe _citoyen_ Beauvisage, in his red cap, the badge of his office, put\nout his long arms in the attitude of a peacemaker, and addressing the\nporter and the joiner:\n\n\"A hundred _sols_,\" he announced, \"to whichever of you will inform us\nwhere to find a suspect, wanted by the Committee of General Security, a\n_ci-devant_ named des Ilettes, a maker of dancing-dolls.\"\n\nWith one accord porter and carpenter designated Brotteaux's lodging, the\nonly quarrel now between them being who should have the assignat for a\nhundred _sols_ promised the informer.\n\nDelourmel, Gu\u00c3\u00a9not, and Beauvisage, followed by the four grenadiers,\nRemacle the porter, Dupont the carpenter, and a dozen little scamps of\nthe neighbourhood filed up the stairs which shook under their tread, and\nfinally mounted the ladder to the attics.\n\nBrotteaux was in his garret busy cutting out his dancing figures, while\nthe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare sat facing him, stringing their scattered limbs on\nthreads, smiling to himself to see rhythm and harmony thus growing under\nhis fingers.\n\nAt the sound of muskets being grounded on the landing, the monk trembled\nin every limb, not that he was a whit less courageous than Brotteaux,\nwho never moved a muscle, but the habit of respect for human conventions\nhad never disciplined him to assume an attitude of self-composure.\nBrotteaux gathered from the _citoyen_ Delourmel's questions the quarter\nfrom which the blow had come and saw too late how unwise it is to\nconfide in women. He obeyed the _citoyen_ Commissary's order to go with\nhim, first picking up his Lucretius and his three shirts.\n\n\"The _citoyen_,\" he said, pointing to the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, \"is an\nassistant I have taken to help me make my marionettes. His home is\nhere.\"\n\nBut the monk failing to produce a certificate of citizenship, was put\nunder arrest along with Brotteaux.\n\nAs the procession filed past the porter's door, the _citoyenne_ Remacle,\nleaning on her broom, looked at her lodger with the eyes of virtue\nbeholding crime in the clutches of the law. Little Jos\u00c3\u00a9phine, dainty and\ndisdainful, held back Mouton by his collar when the dog tried to fawn on\nthe friend who had often given him a lump of sugar. A gaping crowd\nfilled the Place de Thionville.\n\nAt the foot of the stairs Brotteaux came face to face with a young\npeasant woman who was on the point of going up. She carried a basket on\nher arm full of eggs and in her hand a flat cake wrapped in a napkin. It\nwas Athena\u00c3\u00afs, who had come from Palaiseau to present her saviour with a\ntoken of her gratitude. When she observed a posse of magistrates and\nfour grenadiers and \"Monsieur Maurice\" being led away a prisoner, she\nstopped in consternation and asked if it was really true; then she\nstepped up to the Commissary and said in a gentle voice:\n\n\"You are not taking him to prison? it can't be possible.... Why! you\ndon't know him! God himself is not better or kinder.\"\n\nThe _citoyen_ Delourmel pushed her away and beckoned to the grenadiers\nto come forward. Then Athena\u00c3\u00afs let loose a torrent of the foulest abuse,\nthe filthiest and most abominable invective, at the magistrates and\nsoldiers, who thought that all the rinsings of the Palais-Royal and the\nRue Fromenteau were being emptied over their devoted heads. After which,\nin a voice that filled the whole Place de Thionville and sent a shudder\nthrough the throng of curious onlookers:\n\n\"Vive le roi! Vive le roi!\" she yelled.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nThe _citoyenne_ Gamelin was devoted to old Brotteaux, and taking him\naltogether, thought him the best and greatest man she had ever known.\nShe had not bidden him good-bye when he was arrested, because she would\nnot have dared to defy the powers that be and because in her lowly\nestate she looked upon cowardice as a duty. But she had received a blow\nshe could not recover from.\n\nShe could not eat and lamented she had lost her appetite just when she\nhad at last the means to satisfy it. She still admired her son; but she\ndurst not let her mind dwell on the appalling duties he was engaged upon\nand congratulated herself she was only an ignorant woman who had no call\nto judge his conduct.\n\nThe poor mother had found a rosary at the bottom of a trunk; she hardly\nknew how to use it, but often fumbled the beads in her trembling\nfingers. She had lived to grow old without any overt exercise of her\nreligion, but she had always been a pious woman, and she would pray to\nGod all day long, in the chimney corner, to save her boy and that good,\nkind Monsieur Brotteaux. \u00c3\u0089lodie often came to see her; they durst not\nlook each other in the eyes, and sitting side by side they would talk at\nrandom of indifferent matters.\n\nOne day in Pluviose, when the snow, falling in heavy flakes, darkened\nthe sky and deadened the noises of the city, the _citoyenne_ Gamelin,\nwho was alone in the lodging heard a knock at the door. She started\nviolently; for months now the slightest noise had set her trembling. She\nopened the door. A young man of eighteen or twenty walked in, his hat on\nhis head. He was dressed in a bottle-green box-coat, the triple collar\nof which covered his bust and descended to the waist. He wore top-boots\nof an English cut. His chestnut hair fell in ringlets about his\nshoulders. He stepped into the middle of the studio, as if wishful that\nall the light admitted by the snow-encumbered skylight might fall on\nhim, and stood there some moments without moving or speaking.\n\nAt last, in answer to the _citoyenne_ Gamelin's look of amazement:\n\n\"Don't you know your daughter?\"\n\nThe old dame clasped her hands:\n\n\"Julie!... It is you.... Good God! is it possible?...\"\n\n\"Why, yes, it is I. Kiss me, mother.\"\n\nThe _citoyenne_ Gamelin pressed her daughter to her bosom, and dropped a\ntear on the collar of the box-coat. Then she began again in an anxious\nvoice:\n\n\"You, in Paris!...\"\n\n\"Ah! mother, but why did I not come alone! For myself, they will never\nknow me in this dress.\"\n\nIt was a fact the box-coat sufficiently disguised her shape, and she did\nnot look very different from a great many very young men, who, like her,\nwore their hair long and parted in two masses on the forehead. Her\nfeatures, which were delicately cut and charming, but burnt by the sun,\ndrawn with fatigue, worn with anxiety, had a bold, masculine\nexpression. She was slim, with long straight limbs and an easy\ncarriage; only the clear treble of her voice could have betrayed her\nsex.\n\nHer mother asked her if she was hungry. She said she would be glad of\nsomething to eat, and when bread, wine and ham had been set before her,\nshe fell to, one elbow on the table, with a pretty gluttony, like Ceres\nin the hut of the old woman Baubo.\n\nThen, the glass still at her lips:\n\n\"Mother,\" she asked, \"do you know when my brother will be back? I have\ncome to speak to him.\"\n\nThe good woman looked at her daughter in embarrassment and said nothing.\n\n\"I must see him. My husband was arrested this morning and taken to the\nLuxembourg.\"\n\nBy this name of \"husband\" she designated Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 de Chassagne, a\n_ci-devant_ noble and officer in Bouill\u00c3\u00a9's regiment. He had first loved\nher when she was a work-girl at a milliner's in the Rue des Lombards,\nand had carried her away with him to England, whither he had fled after\nthe 10th August. He was her lover; but she thought it more becoming to\nspeak of him as her husband before her mother. Indeed, she told herself\nthat the hardships they had shared had surely united them in a wedlock\nconsecrated by suffering.\n\nMore than once they had spent the night side by side on a bench in one\nof the London parks and gathered up scraps of broken bread under the\ntable in the taverns in Piccadilly.\n\nHer mother could find no answer and gazed at her mournfully.\n\n\"Don't you hear what I say, mother? Time presses, I must see \u00c3\u0089variste\nat once; he, and he only, can save Fortun\u00c3\u00a9's life.\"\n\n\"Julie,\" answered her mother at last, \"it is better you should not speak\nto your brother.\"\n\n\"Why, what do you mean, mother?\"\n\n\"I mean what I say, it is better you do not speak to your brother about\nMonsieur de Chassagne.\"\n\n\"But, mother, I must!\"\n\n\"My child, \u00c3\u0089variste can never forgive Monsieur de Chassagne for his\ntreatment of you. You know how angrily he used to speak of him, what\nnames he called him.\"\n\n\"Yes, he called him seducer,\" said Julie with a little hissing laugh,\nshrugging her shoulders.\n\n\"My child, it was a mortal blow to his pride. \u00c3\u0089variste has vowed never\nagain to mention Monsieur de Chassagne's name, and for two years now he\nhas not breathed one word of him or of you. But his feelings have not\naltered; you know him, he can never forgive you.\"\n\n\"But, mother, as Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 has married me ... in London....\"\n\nThe poor mother threw up her eyes and hands:\n\n\"Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 is an aristocrat, an _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9_, and that is cause enough to make\n\u00c3\u0089variste treat him as an enemy.\"\n\n\"Mother, give me a direct answer. Do you mean that if I ask him to go to\nthe Public Prosecutor and the Committee of General Security and take the\nnecessary steps to save Fortun\u00c3\u00a9's life, do you mean that he will not\nconsent?... But, mother, he would be a monster if he refused!\"\n\n\"My child, your brother is an honest man and a good son. But do not ask\nhim, oh! do not ask him to intercede for Monsieur de Chassagne....\nListen to me, Julie. He does not confide his thoughts to me and, no\ndoubt, I should not be competent to understand them ... but he is a\njuror; he has principles; he acts as his conscience dictates. Do not ask\nhim anything, Julie.\"\n\n\"Ah! I see you know him now. You know that he is cold, callous, that he\nis a bad man, that ambition and vainglory are his only guides. And you\nalways loved him better than me. When we lived together, all three of\nus, you set him up as my pattern to copy. His staid demeanour and grave\nspeech impressed you; you thought he possessed all the virtues. And me,\nme you always blamed, you gave me all the vices, because I was frank and\nfree, and because I climbed trees. You could never endure me. You loved\nnobody but him. There, I hate him, your model \u00c3\u0089variste; he is a\nhypocrite.\"\n\n\"Hush, Julie! I have been a good mother to you as well as to him. I had\nyou taught a trade. It has been no fault of mine that you are not an\nhonest woman and did not marry in your station. I loved you tenderly and\nI love you still. I forgive you and I love you. But do not speak ill of\n\u00c3\u0089variste. He is a good son. He has always taken care of me. When you\nleft me, my child, when you abandoned your trade and forsook your shop,\nto go and live with Monsieur de Chassagne, what would have become of me\nwithout him? I should have died of hunger and wretchedness.\"\n\n\"Do not talk so, mother; you know very well we would have cherished you\nwith all affection, Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 and I, if you had not turned your face from\nus, at \u00c3\u0089variste's instigation. Never tell me! he is incapable of a\nkindly action. It was to make me odious in your eyes that he made a\npretence of caring for you. He! love you?... Is he capable of loving\nanyone? He has neither heart nor head. He has no talent, not a scrap. To\npaint, a man must have a softer, tenderer nature than his.\"\n\nShe threw a glance round the canvases in the studio, which she found to\nbe no better and no worse than when she left her home.\n\n\"There you see his soul! he has put it in his pictures, cold and sombre\nas it is. His Orestes, his Orestes with the dull eye and cruel mouth,\nand looking as if he had been impaled, is himself all over.... But,\nmother, cannot you understand at all? I cannot leave Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 in prison.\nYou know these Jacobins, these patriots, all \u00c3\u0089variste's crew. They will\nkill him. Mother, little mother, darling mother, I cannot have them kill\nhim. I love him! I love him! He has been so good to me, and we have been\nso unhappy together. Look, this box-coat is one of his coats. I had\nnever a shift left. A friend of Fortun\u00c3\u00a9's lent me a jacket and I got a\npost with an eating-house keeper at Dover, while he worked at a\nbarber's. We knew quite well that to return to France was to risk our\nlives; but we were asked if we would go to Paris to carry out an\nimportant mission.... We agreed,--we would have accepted a mission to\nhell! Our travelling expenses were paid and we were given a letter of\nexchange on a Paris banker. We found the offices closed; the banker is\nin prison and going to be guillotined. We had not a brass farthing. All\nthe individuals with whom we were in correspondence and to whom we could\nappeal are fled or imprisoned. Not a door to knock at. We slept in a\nstable in the Rue de la Femme-sans-t\u00c3\u00aate. A charitable bootblack, who\nslept on the same straw with us there, lent my lover one of his boxes, a\nbrush and a pot of blacking three quarters empty. For a fortnight\nFortun\u00c3\u00a9 made his living and mine by blacking shoes in the Place de\nGr\u00c3\u00a8ve.\n\n\"But on Monday a Member of the Commune put his foot on the box to have\nhis boots polished. He had been a butcher once, a man Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 had before\nnow given a kick behind to for selling meat of short weight. When\nFortun\u00c3\u00a9 raised his head to ask for his two sous, the rascal recognized\nhim, called him aristocrat, and threatened to have him arrested. A crowd\ncollected, made up of honest folks and a few blackguards, who began to\nshout \"_Death to the \u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9!_\" and called for the gendarmes. At that\nmoment I came up with Fortun\u00c3\u00a9's bowl of soup. I saw him taken off to the\nSection and shut up in the church of Saint-Jean. I tried to kiss him,\nbut they hustled me away. I spent the night like a dog on the church\nsteps.... They took him away this morning....\"\n\nJulie could not finish, her sobs choked her.\n\nShe threw her hat on the floor and fell on her knees at her mother's\nfeet.\n\n\"They took him away this morning to the Luxembourg prison. Mother,\nmother, help me to save him; have pity on your child!\"\n\nDrowned in her tears, she threw open her box-coat and, the better to\nprove herself a woman and a wife, bared her bosom; seizing her mother's\nhands, she held them close over her throbbing breasts.\n\n\"My darling, my daughter, Julie, my Julie!\" sobbed the widow\nGamelin,--and pressed her streaming cheeks to the girl's.\n\nFor some moments they clung together without a word. The poor mother\nwas racking her brains for some way of helping her daughter, and Julie\nwas watching the kind look in those tearful eyes.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" thought \u00c3\u0089variste's mother, \"perhaps, if I speak to him, he\nwill be melted. He is good, he is tender-hearted. If politics had not\nhardened him, if he had not been influenced by the Jacobins, he would\nnever have had these cruel feelings, that terrify me because I cannot\nunderstand them.\"\n\nShe took Julie's head in her two hands:\n\n\"Listen, my child. I will speak to \u00c3\u0089variste. I will sound him, get him\nto see you and hear your story. The sight of you might anger him; his\nfirst impulse might be to turn against you.... And then, I know him;\nthis costume would offend him; he is uncompromising in everything that\ntouches morals, that shocks the proprieties. _I_ was a bit startled to\nsee my Julie dressed as a man.\"\n\n\"Oh! mother, the emigration and the fearful disorders of the kingdom\nhave made these disguises quite a common thing. They are adopted in\norder to follow a trade, to escape recognition, to get a borrowed\npassport or a certificate approved. In London I saw young Girey dressed\nas a girl,--and he made a very pretty girl; you must own, mother, _that_\nis a more scandalous disguise than mine.\"\n\n\"My poor child, you have no need to justify yourself in my eyes, whether\nin this or any other thing. I am your mother; for me you will always be\nblameless. I will speak to \u00c3\u0089variste, I will say....\"\n\nShe broke off. She knew what her son was; she felt it in her heart, but\nshe would not believe it, she _would_ not know it.\n\n\"He is kind-hearted. He will do it for my sake ... for your sake, he\nwill do what I ask him.\"\n\nThe two women, weary to the death, fell silent. Julie sank asleep, her\nhead pillowed on the knees where she had rested as a child, while the\nmother, the rosary between her hands, wept, like another _mater\ndolorosa_, over the calamities she felt drawing stealthily nearer and\nnearer in the silence of this day of snow when everything was hushed,\nfootsteps and carriage wheels and the very heaven itself.\n\nSuddenly, with a keenness of hearing sharpened by anxiety, she caught\nthe sound of her son's steps on the stairs.\n\n\"\u00c3\u0089variste!\" she cried. \"Hide\"--and she hurried the girl into the\nbedroom.\n\n\"How are you to-day, mother dear?\"\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste hung up his hat on its peg, changed his blue coat for a working\njacket and sat down before his easel. For some days he had been working\nat a sketch in charcoal of a Victory laying a wreath on the brow of a\ndead soldier, who had died for the fatherland. Once the subject would\nhave called out all his enthusiasm, but the Tribunal consumed all his\ndays and absorbed his whole soul, while his hand had lost its knack from\ndisuse and had grown heavy and inert.\n\nHe hummed over the _\u00c3\u0087a ira_.\n\n\"I hear you singing,\" said the _citoyenne_ Gamelin; \"you are\nlight-hearted, \u00c3\u0089variste?\"\n\n\"We have reason to be glad, mother; there is good news. La Vend\u00c3\u00a9e is\ncrushed, the Austrians beaten, the Army of the Rhine has forced the\nlines of Lautern and of Wissembourg. The day is at hand when the\nRepublic triumphant will show her clemency. Why must the conspirators'\naudacity increase the mightier the Republic waxes in strength, and\ntraitors plot to strike the fatherland a blow in the dark at the very\nmoment her lightnings overwhelm the enemies that assail her openly?\"\n\nThe _citoyenne_ Gamelin, as she sat knitting a stocking, was watching\nher son's face over her spectacles.\n\n\"Berz\u00c3\u00a9lius, your old model, has been to ask for the ten livres you owed\nhim; I paid him. Little Jos\u00c3\u00a9phine has had a belly-ache from eating too\nmuch of the preserves the carpenter gave her. So I made her a drop of\nherb tea.... Desmahis has been to see you; he was sorry he did not find\nyou in. He wanted to engrave a design by you. He thinks you have great\ntalent. He is a fine fellow; he looked at your sketches and admired\nthem.\"\n\n\"When peace is re-established and conspiracy suppressed,\" said the\npainter, \"I shall begin on my Orestes again. It is not my way to flatter\nmyself; but that head is worthy of David's brush.\"\n\nHe outlined with a majestic sweep the arm of his Victory.\n\n\"She holds out palms,\" he said. \"But it would be finer if her arms\nthemselves were palms.\"\n\n\"\u00c3\u0089variste!\"\n\n\"Mother?\"\n\n\"I have had news ... guess, of whom....\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Of Julie ... of your sister.... She is not happy.\"\n\n\"It would be a scandal if she were.\"\n\n\"Do not speak so, my son, she is your sister. Julie is not a bad woman;\nshe had a good disposition, which misfortune has developed. She loves\nyou. I can assure you, \u00c3\u0089variste, that she only desires a hard-working,\nexemplary life and her fondest wish is to be reconciled to her friends.\nThere is nothing to prevent your seeing her again. She has married\nFortun\u00c3\u00a9 Chassagne.\"\n\n\"She has written to you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How, then, have you had news of her, mother?\"\n\n\"It was not by letter, \u00c3\u0089variste; it was....\"\n\nHe sprang up and stopped her with a savage cry:\n\n\"Not another word, mother! Do not tell me they have both returned to\nFrance.... As they are doomed to perish, at least let it not be at my\nhands. For their own sake, for yours, for mine, let me not know they are\nin Paris.... Do not force the knowledge on me; otherwise....\"\n\n\"What do you mean, my son? you would think, you would dare...?\"\n\n\"Mother, hear what I say; if I knew my sister Julie to be in that room\n...\" (and he pointed at the closed door), \"I should go instantly to\ndenounce her to the Committee of Vigilance of the Section.\"\n\nThe poor mother, her face as white as her coif, dropped her knitting\nfrom her trembling hands and sighed in a voice fainter than the faintest\nwhisper:\n\n\"I would not believe it, but I see it now; my boy is a monster....\"\n\nAs pale as she, the froth gathering on his lips, \u00c3\u0089variste fled from the\nhouse and ran to find at \u00c3\u0089lodie's side forgetfulness, sleep, the\ndelicious foretaste of extinction.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nWhile the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare and the girl Athena\u00c3\u00afs were examined at the\nSection, Brotteaux was led off between two gendarmes to the Luxembourg,\nwhere the door-keeper refused to admit him, declaring he had no room\nleft. The old financier was next taken to the Conciergerie and brought\ninto the Gaoler's office, quite a small room, divided in two by a glazed\npartition. While the clerk was inscribing his name in the prison\nregisters, Brotteaux could see through the panes two men lying each on a\ntattered mattress, both as still as death and with glazed eyes that\nseemed to see nothing. Plates, bottles and bits of broken bread and meat\nlittered the floor round them. They were prisoners condemned to death\nand waiting for the cart to arrive.\n\nThe _ci-devant_ Monsieur des Ilettes was thrust into a dungeon, where by\nthe light of a lantern he could just make out two figures stretched on\nthe ground, one savage-looking and hideously mutilated, the other\ngraceful and pleasing. The two prisoners offered him a share of their\nstraw, and this, rotten and swarming with vermin as it was, was better\nthan having to lie on the earth, which was befouled with excrement.\nBrotteaux sank down on a bench in the pestiferous darkness and sat\nthere, his head against the wall, speechless and motionless. So intense\nwas his agony of mind he would have dashed out his brains against the\nstones if he had had the strength. He could not breathe. His eyes swam,\nand a long-drawn murmur, as soft as silence, filled his ears. He felt\nhis whole being bathed in a delicious semi-consciousness. For one\nincomparable moment everything was harmony, serenity, light, fragrance,\nsweetness. Then he ceased to know or feel anything.\n\nWhen he returned to himself, the first notion that entered his head was\nto regret his coma and, a philosopher even in the stupor of despair, he\nreflected how he had had to plunge to the depths of an underground\ndungeon, there to await execution, to enjoy the most exquisite of all\nvoluptuous sensations he had ever tasted. He tried hard to lose\nconsciousness again, but without success; on the contrary, little by\nlittle he felt the poisonous air of the dungeon fill his lungs and bring\nwith it, along with the fever of life, a full consciousness of his\nintolerable wretchedness.\n\nMeantime his two companions regarded his silence as a cruel personal\ninsult. Brotteaux, who was of a sociable turn, endeavoured to satisfy\ntheir curiosity; but when they discovered he was only what they called\n\"a political,\" one of the mild sort whose crime was only a matter of\nwords and opinions, they lost all respect and sympathy for him. The\noffences charged against these two prisoners had more grit; the older of\nthe men was a murderer, the other had been manufacturing forged\nassignats. Both made the best of their situation and even found some\nalleviations in it. Brotteaux's thoughts suddenly turned to the world\nabove him,--how over his head all was noise and bustle, light and life,\nwhile the pretty shopwomen in the Palais de Justice behind their\ncounters, loaded with perfumery and pretty knicknacks, smiled on their\ncustomers, happy people free to go where they pleased,--and the picture\ndoubled his despair.\n\nNight fell, unmarked in the darkness and silence of the dungeon, but yet\ngloomy and oppressive. One leg extended on his bench and his back\npropped against the wall, Brotteaux fell into a doze. And lo! he saw\nhimself seated at the foot of a leafy beech, in which the birds were\nsinging; the setting sun bathed the river in liquid fire and the clouds\nwere edged with purple. The night wore through. A burning fever consumed\nhim and he greedily drained his pitcher to the dregs, but the fetid\nwater only increased his distress.\n\nNext day the gaoler who brought the food promised Brotteaux, if he could\nafford the cost, to give him the privileges of a prisoner who pays for\nhis accommodation, so soon as there should be room, and it was not\nlikely to be long first. And so it turned out; two days later he invited\nthe old financier to leave his dungeon. At every step he took upwards,\nBrotteaux felt life and vigour coming back to him, and when he saw a\nroom with a red-tiled floor and in it a bed of sacking covered with a\ndingy woollen counterpane, he wept for joy. The gilded bed carved with\ndoves billing and cooing that he had once had made for the prettiest of\nthe dancers at the Opera had not seemed so desirable or promised him\nsuch delights.\n\nThis bed of sacking was in a large hall, very fairly clean, which held\nseventeen others like it, separated by high partitions of planks. The\ncompany that occupied these quarters, composed of ex-nobles, tradesmen,\nbankers, working-men, hit the old publican's taste well enough, for he\ncould accommodate himself to persons of all qualities. He noticed that\nthese, cut off like himself from every opportunity of pleasure and\nforedoomed to perish at the hand of the executioner, were of a very\nmerry humour and showed a marked taste for wit and raillery. His bent\nwas to think lightly of mankind, so he attributed the high spirits of\nhis companions to the frivolity of their minds, which prevented them\nfrom looking seriously at their situation. Moreover, he was strengthened\nin his opinion by observing how the more intelligent among them were\nprofoundly sad. He remarked before long, that, for the most part, wine\nand brandy supplied the inspiration of a gaiety that betrayed its source\nby its violent and sometimes almost insane character. They did not all\npossess courage; but all made a display of it. This caused Brotteaux no\nsurprise; he was well aware how men will readily enough avow cruelty,\npassion, even avarice, but never cowardice, because such an admission\nwould bring them, among savages and even in civilized society, into\nmortal danger. That is the reason, he reflected, why all nations are\nnations of heroes and all armies are made up of brave men only.\n\nMore potent, even, than wine and brandy were the rattle of weapons and\nkeys, the clash of locks and bolts, the cry of sentries, the stamping of\nfeet at the door of the Tribunal, to intoxicate the prisoners and fill\ntheir minds with melancholy, insanity, or frenzy. Some there were who\ncut their throat with a razor or threw themselves from a window.\n\nBrotteaux had been living for three days in these privileged quarters\nwhen he learned through the turnkey that the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare was\nlanguishing on the rotten verminous straw of the common prison with the\nthieves and murderers. He had him put on paying terms in the same room\nas himself, where a bed had fallen vacant. Having promised to pay for\nthe monk, the old publican, who had no large sum of money about him,\nstruck out the idea of making portraits at a crown apiece. By the help\nof a gaoler, he procured a supply of small black frames in which to put\npretty little designs in hair which he executed with considerable\ncleverness. These productions sold well, being highly appreciated among\npeople whose thoughts were set on leaving souvenirs to their friends.\n\nThe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare kept a good heart and a high spirit. While waiting\nhis summons to appear before the Revolutionary Tribunal, he was\npreparing his defence. Drawing no distinction between his own case and\nthat of the Church, he promised himself to expose to his judges the\ndisorders and scandals to which the Spouse of Christ was exposed by the\nCivil Constitution of the Clergy; he proposed to depict the eldest\ndaughter of the Church waging sacrilegious war upon the Pope, the French\nclergy robbed, outraged, subjected to the odious domination of laics,\nthe regulars, Christ's true army, despoiled and scattered. He cited St.\nGregory the Great and St. Iren\u00c3\u00a6us, quoted numerous articles of the Canon\nLaw and whole paragraphs from the Decretals.\n\nAll day long he sat scribbling on his knees, at the foot of his bed,\ndipping stumps of pens worn to the feathers in ink, soot,\ncoffee-grounds, covering with illegible writing candle-wrappers,\npacking-paper, newspapers, playing cards, even thinking of using his\nshirt for the same purpose after starching it. Leaf by leaf the pile\ngrew; pointing to this mass of undecipherable scrawls, he would say:\n\n\"Ah! when I appear before my judges, I will inundate them with light.\"\n\nAnother day, casting a look of satisfaction on his defence, which grew\nbulkier day by day, and thinking of these magistrates he was burning to\nconfound, he cried:\n\n\"I wouldn't like to be in _their_ shoes!\"\n\nThe prisoners whom fate had brought together in this prison-room were\nRoyalists or Federalists, there was even a Jacobin amongst the rest;\nthey held widely different views as to the right way of conducting the\nbusiness of the State, but not one of them all preserved the smallest\nvestige of Christian beliefs. Feuillants, Constitutionals, Girondists,\nall, like Brotteaux, considered the Christians' God a very bad thing for\nthemselves and an excellent one for the people; as for the Jacobins,\nthey were for installing in the place of Jehovah a Jacobin god, anxious\nto refer the dispensation of Jacobinism on earth to a higher source. But\nas they could not conceive, either one or the other, of anybody being so\nabsurd as to believe in any revealed religion, seeing that the P\u00c3\u00a8re\nLonguemare was no fool, they took him to be a knave. By way, no doubt,\nof preparing for martyrdom, he made confession of faith at every\nopportunity, and the more sincerity he displayed, the more like an\nimpostor he seemed.\n\nIn vain Brotteaux stood surety for the monk's good faith; Brotteaux\nhimself was reputed to believe only a part of what he said. His ideas\nwere too singular not to appear affected and satisfied nobody entirely.\nHe dubbed Jean-Jacques a dull, paltry rascal. Voltaire, on the other\nhand, he accounted among the divinely-gifted men, though not on the\nsame level as the amiable Helv\u00c3\u00a9tius, or Diderot, or the Baron d'Holbach.\nIn his opinion the greatest genius of the century was Boulanger. He also\nthought highly of the astronomer Lalande and of Dupuis, author of a\n_Memoir on the origin of the Constellations_.\n\nThe wits of the company made a thousand jokes at the poor Barnabite's\nexpense, the point of which he never saw; his simplicity saved him from\nevery pitfall. To drown the suspense that racked them and escape the\ntorments of idleness, the prisoners played at draughts, cards and\nbackgammon. No instrument of music was allowed. After supper they would\nsing, or recite verses. Voltaire's _La Pucelle_ brought a little\ncheerfulness to these aching hearts, and the company never wearied of\nhearing the telling passages repeated. But, unable to distract their\nthoughts from the appalling vision that always loomed before their\nmind's eye, they strove sometimes to make a diversion of it, and in the\nchamber of the eighteen beds, before turning in for the night, they\nwould play the game of the Revolutionary Tribunal. The parts were\ndistributed according to tastes and aptitudes. While some represented\nthe judges and prosecutor, others were the accused or the witnesses,\nothers again the headsman and his men. The trials invariably wound up\nwith the execution of the condemned, who were laid at full length on a\nbed, the neck underneath a plank. The scene then shifted to the infernal\nregions. The most agile of the troop, wrapped in white sheets, played\nspectres. There was a young _avocat_ from Bordeaux, a man named Dubosc,\nshort, dark, one-eyed, humpbacked, bandy-legged, the very black deuce in\nperson, who used to come all horned and hoofed, to drag the P\u00c3\u00a8re\nLonguemare feet first out of his bed, announcing to the culprit that he\nwas condemned to the everlasting flames of hell and doomed past\nredemption for having made of the Creator of the Universe a jealous\nbeing, a blockhead, and a bully, an enemy of human happiness and love.\n\n\"Ah! ha! ha!\" the devil would scream discordantly, \"so you taught, you\nold bonze, that God delights to see His creatures languish in contrition\nand deny themselves His dearest gifts. Impostor, hypocrite, sneak, sit\non nails and eat egg-shells for all eternity!\"\n\nThe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, for all reply, would observe that the speech showed\nthe philosopher's cloven hoof behind the devil's and that the meanest\nimp of hell would never have talked such foolishness, having at least\nrubbed shoulders with Theology and for certain being less ignorant than\nan Encyclop\u00c3\u00a6dist.\n\nBut when the Girondist _avocat_ called him a Capuchin, he turned scarlet\nwith anger and declared that a man incapable of distinguishing a\nBarnabite from a Franciscan was too blind to see a fly in milk.\n\nThe Revolutionary Tribunal was always draining the prisons, which the\nCommittees were as unceasingly replenishing; in three months the chamber\nof the eighteen was half full of new faces. The P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare lost his\ntormentor. The _avocat_ Dubosc was haled before the Revolutionary\nTribunal and condemned to death as a Federalist and for having conspired\nagainst the unity of the Republic. On leaving the court, he returned, as\nthe prisoners always did, by a corridor that ran through the prison and\nopened on the room he had enlivened for three months with his gaiety.\nAs he made his farewells to his companions, he maintained the same light\ntone and cheerful air that were habitual with him.\n\n\"Forgive me, sir,\" he said to the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, \"for having hauled\nyou feet foremost from your bed. I will never do it again.\"\n\nThen, turning to old Brotteaux:\n\n\"Good-bye, I go before you into the land of nowhere. I gladly return to\nNature the atoms of my composition, only hoping she will make a better\nuse of them for the future, for it must be owned she did not make much\nof a job of me.\"\n\nSo he went on his way to the gaoler's room, leaving Brotteaux sorrowful\nand the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare trembling and green as a leaf, more dead than\nalive to see the impious wretch laugh on the brink of the abyss.\n\nWhen Germinal brought back the bright days, Brotteaux, who was of an\nardent temperament, tramped down several times every day to the\ncourtyard giving on the women's quarters, near the fountain where the\nfemale prisoners used to come of a morning to wash their linen. An iron\nrailing separated the two barracks; but the bars were not so close\ntogether as to hinder hands joining and lips meeting. Under the kindly\nshade of night loving couples would press against the obstacle. At such\ntimes Brotteaux would retire discreetly to the staircase and, sitting on\na step, would draw from the pocket of his plum-coloured surtout his\nlittle Lucretius and read, by the light of a lantern, some of the\nauthor's sternly consolatory maxims: \"_Sic ubi non erimus_.... When we\nshall have ceased to be, nothing will have power to move us, not even\nthe heavens and earth and sea confounding their shattered\nfragments....\" But, in the act of enjoying his exalted wisdom, Brotteaux\nwould find himself envying the Barnabite this craze that veiled the\nuniverse from his eyes.\n\nMonth by month terror grew more intense. Every night the tipsy gaolers,\ntheir watch-dogs at their heels, would march from cell to cell,\ndelivering acts of accusation, howling out names they mutilated, waking\nthe prisoners and for twenty victims marked on their list terrifying two\nhundred. Along these corridors, reeking with bloody memories, passed\nevery day, without a murmur, twenty, thirty, fifty condemned prisoners,\nold men, women, young men and maidens, so widely different in rank and\ncharacter and opinion that the question rose involuntarily to the\nlips,--had they not been chosen by lot?\n\nAnd the card playing went on, the Burgundy drinking, the making of\nplans, the assignations for after dark at the rails. The company, new\nalmost to a man, now consisted in great part of \"extremists\" and\n\"irreconcilables.\" But still the room of the eighteen beds remained the\nhome of elegance and good breeding; barring two prisoners recently\ntransferred from the Luxembourg to the Conciergerie and added to the\ncompany, by whom they were suspected of being spies, the _citoyens_\nNavette and Bellier by name, there were none but honest folk there who\nreposed a mutual trust in each other. Glass in hand, the victories of\nthe Republic were celebrated by all. Amongst the rest were several\npoets, as there always are in any gathering of people with nothing to\ndo. The most accomplished composed odes on the triumphs of the Army of\nthe Rhine, which they recited with much mouthing. They were\nuproariously applauded. Brotteaux was the only lukewarm admirer of the\nvictors and the bards who sang their victories.\n\n\"Since Homer began it,\" he observed one day, \"it has always been a mania\nwith poets, this extolling the powers of fighting-men. War is not an\nart, and luck alone decides the fate of battles. With two generals, both\nblockheads, face to face, one of them must inevitably be victorious.\nWait till some day one of these warriors you make gods of swallows you\nall up like the stork in the fable who gobbles up the frogs. Ah! then he\nwould be really and truly a God! For you can always tell the gods by\ntheir appetite.\"\n\nBrotteaux's head had never been turned by the glamour of arms. He felt\nno triumph at the victories of the Republic, which he had foreseen. He\ndid not like the new r\u00c3\u00a9gime, which military success confirmed. He was a\nmalcontent. Another would have been the same for less cause.\n\nOne morning it was announced that the Commissaries of the Committee of\nGeneral Security were going to institute a search in the prisoners'\nquarters, that they would seize assignats, articles of gold and silver,\nknives, scissors; that similar proceedings had been taken at the\nLuxembourg, where letters, papers, and books had been taken possession\nof.\n\nThereupon everyone tried to think of some hiding place in which to\nsecure whatever he held most precious. The P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare carried away\nhis defence in armfuls to a rain-gutter, while Brotteaux slipped his\nLucretius among the ashes on the hearth.\n\nWhen the Commissaries, wearing tricolour ribands at their necks,\narrived to carry out their perquisition, they found scarcely anything\nbut such trifles as it had been deemed judicious to let them discover.\nOn their departure, the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare ran to his rain-pipe and rescued\nas much of his defence as wind and water had spared. Brotteaux pulled\nout his Lucretius from the fireplace all black with soot.\n\n\"Let us make the best of the present,\" he thought, \"for I augur from\nsundry tokens that our time is straitly measured from henceforth.\"\n\nOne soft night in Prairial, while over the prison yard the moon riding\nhigh in a pale sky showed her two silver horns, the ex-financier, who,\nas his way was, sat reading Lucretius on a step of the stone stairs,\nheard a voice call him, a woman's voice, a delightful voice, which he\ndid not know. He went down into the court and saw behind the railing a\nform which he recognized as little as he did the voice, but which\nreminded him, in its half-seen fascinating outlines, of all the women he\nhad loved. A flood of silvery blue moonlight fell on it. Next instant\nBrotteaux recognized the pretty actress of the Rue Feydeau, Rose\nTh\u00c3\u00a9venin.\n\n\"You here, my child! It is a joy to see you, but it stabs my heart.\nSince when have you been here, and why?\"\n\n\"Since yesterday,\"--and she added very low:\n\n\"I have been denounced as a Royalist. They accuse me of conspiring to\nset free the Queen. Knowing you were here, I tried at once to see you.\nListen to me, dear friend ... you will let me call you so?... I know\npeople in power; I have sympathizers, I am sure of it, on the Committee\nof Public Safety itself. I will set my friends to work; they will\ndeliver me, and _I_ will deliver you.\"\n\nBut Brotteaux in a voice that took on an accent of urgency:\n\n\"By everything you hold dear, my child, do nothing of the sort! Do not\nwrite, do not petition; ask nothing of anybody, I conjure you, let\nyourself be forgotten.\"\n\nAs she appeared unconvinced by what he said, he went on more\nbeseechingly still:\n\n\"Not a word, Rose, let them forget you; there lies safety. Anything your\nfriends might attempt would only hasten your undoing. Time is\neverything; only a short delay, a very short one, I hope, is needed to\nsave you.... Above all, never try to melt the judges, the jurors, a\nGamelin. They are not men, they are things; there is no arguing with\nthings. Let them forget you; if you take my advice, sweetheart, I shall\ndie happy, happy to have saved your life.\"\n\nShe answered:\n\n\"I will do as you say.... Never talk of dying....\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"My life is ended, my child. Do you live and be happy.\"\n\nShe took his hands and laid them on her bosom:\n\n\"Hear what I say, dear friend.... I have only seen you once for a day,\nand yet you are not indifferent to me. And if what I am going to tell\nyou can renew your attachment to life, oh! believe my promise,--I will\nbe for you ... whatever you shall wish me to be.\"\n\nAnd they exchanged a kiss on the mouth through the bars.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin, as he sat, one day that a long, tedious case was\nbefore the Tribunal, on the jury-bench in the stifling court, closed his\neyes and thought:\n\n\"Evil-doers, by forcing Marat to hide in holes and corners, had turned\nhim into a bird of night, the bird of Minerva, whose glance pierced the\ndark recesses where conspirators lurked. Now it is a blue eye, cold and\ncalm, that discovers the enemies of the State and denounces traitors\nwith a subtlety unknown even to the Friend of the People, now asleep for\never in the garden of the Cordeliers. The new saviour of the country, as\nzealous and more keen-sighted than the first, sees what no man before\nhad seen and with a lifted finger spreads terror broadcast. He discerns\nthe fine, imperceptible shades of difference that divide evil from good,\nvice from virtue, which but for him would have been confounded, to the\nhurt of the fatherland and freedom, he marks out before him the thin,\ninflexible line outside which lies, to the right hand and to the left,\nonly error, crime, and wickedness. The Incorruptible teaches how men\nserve the foreigner equally by excess of zeal and by supineness, by\npersecuting the religious in the name of reason no less than by fighting\nin the name of religion against the laws of the Republic. Every whit as\nmuch as the villains who immolated Le Peltier and Marat, do they serve\nthe foreigner who decree them divine honours, to compromise their\nmemory. Agent of the foreigner whosoever repudiates the ideas of order,\nwisdom, opportunity; agent of the foreigner whosoever outrages morals,\nscandalizes virtue, and, in the foolishness of his heart, denies God.\nYes, fanatic priests deserve to die; but there is an anti-revolutionary\nway of combating fanaticism; abjurers, too, may be guilty of a crime. By\nmoderation men destroy the Republic; by violence they do the same.\n\n\"August and terrible the functions of a judge,--functions defined by the\nwisest of mankind! It is not aristocrats alone, federalists, scoundrels\nof the Orleans faction, open enemies of the fatherland, that we must\nstrike down. The conspirator, the agent of the foreigner is a Proteus,\nhe assumes all shapes, he puts on the guise of a patriot, a\nrevolutionary, an enemy of Kings; he affects the boldness of a heart\nthat beats only for freedom; his voice swells, and the foes of the\nRepublic tremble. His name is Danton; his violence is a poor cloak to\nhis odious moderatism, and his base corruption is manifest at last. The\nconspirator, the agent of the foreigner is that fluent stammerer, the\nman who clapped the first cockade of revolution in his hat, that\npamphleteer who, in his ironical and cruel patriotism, nicknamed\nhimself, 'The procureur of the Lantern.' _His_ name is Camille\nDesmoulins. He threw off the mask by defending the Generals, traitors to\ntheir country, and claiming measures of clemency criminal at such a\ntime. There was Philippeaux, there was H\u00c3\u00a9rault, there was the despicable\nLacroix. There was the P\u00c3\u00a8re Duchesne, he, too, a conspirator and agent\nof the foreigner, the vile demagogue who degraded liberty, and whose\nfilthy calumnies stirred sympathy for Antoinette herself. There was\nChaumette, who yet was a mild man, popular, moderate, well-intentioned,\nand virtuous in the administration of the Commune; but he was an\natheist! Conspirators, agents of the foreigner,--such were all those\nsansculottes in red cap and carmagnole and sabots who recklessly outbid\nthe Jacobins in patriotism. Conspirator and agent of the foreigner was\nAnacharsis Cloots, 'orator of the human race,' condemned to die by all\nthe Monarchies of the world; but everything was to be feared of him,--he\nwas a Prussian.\n\n\"Now violent or moderate, all these evil-doers, all these\ntraitors,--Danton, Desmoulins, H\u00c3\u00a9bert, Chaumette,--have perished under\nthe axe. The Republic is saved; a chorus of praises rises from all the\nCommittees and the popular assemblies one and all to greet Maximilien\nand _the Mountain_. Good citizens cry aloud: 'Worthy representatives of\na free people, in vain have the sons of the Titans lifted their proud\nheads; oh! mountain of blessing, oh! protecting Sinai, from thy\ntumultuous bosom has issued the saving lightning....'\n\n\"In this chorus the Tribunal has its meed of praise. How sweet a thing\nit is to be virtuous, and how dear to public gratitude, to the heart of\nthe upright judge!\n\n\"Meanwhile, for a patriot heart, what food for amazement, what motives\nfor anxiety! What! to betray the people's cause, it was not enough to\nhave a Mirabeau, a La Fayette, a Bailly, a P\u00c3\u00a9tion, a Brissot? We must\nlikewise have the men who denounced these traitors. Can it be that all\nthe patriots who made the Revolution only wrought to ruin her? that\nthese heroes of the great days were but contriving with Pitt and Coburg\nto give the kingdom to the Orleans and set up a Regency under Louis\nXVII? What! Danton was another Monk. What! Chaumette and the H\u00c3\u00a9bertists,\nfalser than the Federalists who sent them to the guillotine, had\nconspired to destroy the State! But among those who hurried to their\ndeath the traitor Danton and the traitor Chaumette, will not the blue\neye of Robespierre discover anon more perfidious traitors yet? What will\nbe the end of this hideous concatenation of traitors betrayed and the\nrevelations of the keen-sighted Incorruptible?...\"\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nMeantime Julie Gamelin, in her bottle-green box-coat, went every day to\nthe Luxembourg Gardens and there, on a bench at the end of one of the\navenues, sat waiting for the moment when her lover should show his face\nat one of the dormers of the Palace. Then they would beckon to each\nother and talk together in a language of signs they had invented. In\nthis way she learned that the prisoner occupied a fairly good room and\nhad pleasant companions, that he wanted a blanket for his bed and a\nkettle and loved his mistress fondly.\n\nShe was not the only one to watch for the sight of a dear face at a\nwindow of the Palace now turned into a prison. A young mother not far\nfrom her kept her eyes fixed on a closed casement; then directly she saw\nit open, she would lift her little one in her arms above her head. An\nold lady in a lace veil sat for long hours on a folding-chair, vainly\nhoping to catch a momentary glimpse of her son, who, for fear of\nbreaking down, never left his game of quoits in the courtyard of the\nprison till the hour when the gardens were closed.\n\nDuring these long hours of waiting, whether the sky were blue or\novercast, a man of middle age, rather stout and very neatly dressed, was\nconstantly to be seen on a neighbouring bench, playing with his\nsnuff-box and the charms on his watch-guard or unfolding a newspaper,\nwhich he never read. He was dressed like a bourgeois of the old school\nin a gold-laced cocked hat, a plum-coloured coat and blue waistcoat\nembroidered in silver. He looked well-meaning enough, and was something\nof a musician to judge by a flute, one end of which peeped from his\npocket. Never for a moment did his eyes wander from the supposed\nstripling, on whom he bestowed continual smiles, and when he saw him\nleave his seat, he would get up himself and follow him at a distance.\nJulie, in her misery and loneliness, was touched by the discreet\nsympathy the good man manifested.\n\nOne day, as she was leaving the gardens, it began to rain; the old\nfellow stepped up to her and, opening his vast red umbrella, asked\npermission to offer her its shelter. She answered sweetly, in her clear\ntreble, that she would be very glad. But at the sound of her voice and\nwarned perhaps by a subtle scent of womanhood, he strode rapidly away,\nleaving the girl exposed to the rain-storm; she took in the situation,\nand, despite her gnawing anxieties, could not restrain a smile.\n\nJulie lived in an attic in the Rue du Cherche-Midi and represented\nherself as a draper's shop-boy in search of employment; the widow\nGamelin, at last convinced that the girl was running smaller risks\nanywhere else than at her home, had got her away from the Place de\nThionville and the Section du Pont-Neuf, and was giving her all the help\nshe could in the way of food and linen. Julie did her trifle of cooking,\nwent to the Luxembourg to see her beloved prisoner and back again to her\ngarret; the monotony of the life was a balm to her grief, and, being\nyoung and strong, she slept well and soundly the night through. She was\nof a fearless temper and broken in to an adventurous life; the costume\nshe wore added perhaps a further spice of excitement, and she would\nsometimes sally out at night to visit a restaurateur's in the Rue du\nFour, at the sign of the Red Cross, a place frequented by men of all\nsorts and conditions and women of gallantry. There she read the papers\nor played backgammon with some tradesman's clerk or citizen-soldier, who\nsmoked his pipe in her face. Drinking, gambling, love-making were the\norder of the day, and scuffles were not unfrequent. One evening a\ncustomer, hearing a trampling of hoofs on the paved roadway outside,\nlifted the curtain, and recognizing the Commandant-in-Chief of the\nNational Guard, the _citoyen_ Hanriot, who was riding past with his\nStaff, muttered between his teeth:\n\n\"There goes Robespierre's jackass!\"\n\nJulie overheard and burst into a loud guffaw.\n\nBut a moustachioed patriot took up the challenge roundly:\n\n\"Whoever says that,\" he shouted, \"is a bl--sted aristocrat, and I should\nlike to see the fellow sneeze into Samson's basket. I tell you General\nHanriot is a good patriot who'll know how to defend Paris and the\nConvention at a pinch. That's why the Royalists can't forgive him.\"\n\nGlaring at Julie, who was still laughing, the patriot added:\n\n\"You there, greenhorn, have a care I don't land you a kick in the\nbackside to learn you to respect good patriots.\"\n\nBut other voices were joining in:\n\n\"Hanriot's a drunken sot and a fool!\"\n\n\"Hanriot's a good Jacobin! Vive Hanriot!\"\n\nSides were taken, and the fray began. Blows were exchanged, hats\nbattered in, tables overturned, and glasses shivered; the lights went\nout and the women began to scream. Two or three patriots fell upon\nJulie, who seized hold of a settle in self-defence; she was brought to\nthe ground, where she scratched and bit her assailants. Her coat flew\nopen and her neckerchief was torn, revealing her panting bosom. A patrol\ncame running up at the noise, and the girl aristocrat escaped between\nthe gendarmes' legs.\n\nEvery day the carts were full of victims for the guillotine.\n\n\"But I cannot, I cannot let my lover die!\" Julie would tell her mother.\n\nShe resolved to beg his life, to take what steps were possible, to go to\nthe Committees and Public Departments, to canvas Representatives,\nMagistrates, to visit anyone who could be of help. She had no woman's\ndress to wear. Her mother borrowed a striped gown, a kerchief, a lace\ncoif from the _citoyenne_ Blaise, and Julie, attired as a woman and a\npatriot, set out for the abode of one of the judges, Renaudin, a damp,\ndismal house in the Rue Mazarine.\n\nWith trembling steps she climbed the wooden, tiled stairs and was\nreceived by the judge in his squalid cabinet, furnished with a deal\ntable and two straw-bottomed chairs. The wall-paper hung in strips.\nRenaudin, with black hair plastered on his forehead, a lowering eye,\ntucked-in lips, and a protuberant chin, signed to her to speak and\nlistened in silence.\n\nShe told him she was the sister of the _citoyen_ Chassagne, a prisoner\nat the Luxembourg, explained as speciously as she could the\ncircumstances under which he had been arrested, represented him as an\ninnocent man, the victim of mischance, pleaded more and more urgently;\nbut he remained callous and unsympathetic.\n\nShe fell at his feet in supplication and burst into tears.\n\nNo sooner did he see her tears than his face changed; his dark\nblood-shot eyes lit up, and his heavy blue jowl worked as if pumping up\nthe saliva in his dry throat.\n\n\"_Citoyenne_, we will do what is necessary. You need have no\nanxiety,\"--and opening a door, he pushed the petitioner into a little\nsitting-room, with rose-pink hangings, painted panels, Dresden china\nfigures, a time-piece and gilt candelabra; for furniture it contained\nsettees, and a sofa covered in tapestry and adorned with a pastoral\ngroup after Boucher. Julie was ready for anything to save her lover.\n\nRenaudin had his way,--rapidly and brutally. When she got up,\nreadjusting the _citoyenne's_ pretty frock, she met the man's cruel\nmocking eye; instantly she knew she had made her sacrifice in vain.\n\n\"You promised me my brother's freedom,\" she said.\n\nHe chuckled.\n\n\"I told you, _citoyenne_, we would do what was necessary,--that is to\nsay, we should apply the law, neither more nor less. I told you to have\nno anxiety,--and why should you be anxious? The Revolutionary Tribunal\nis always just.\"\n\nShe thought of throwing herself upon the man, biting him, tearing out\nhis eyes. But, realizing she would only be consummating Fortun\u00c3\u00a9\nChassagne's ruin, she rushed from the house, and fled to her garret to\ntake off \u00c3\u0089lodie's soiled and desecrated frock. All night she lay,\nscreaming with grief and rage.\n\nNext day, on returning to the Luxembourg, she found the gardens occupied\nby gendarmes, who were turning out the women and children. Sentinels\nwere posted in the avenues to prevent the passers-by from communicating\nwith the prisoners. The young mother, who used to come every day,\ncarrying her child in her arms, told Julie that there was talk of\nplotting in the prisons and that the women were blamed for gathering in\nthe gardens in order to rouse the people's pity in favour of aristocrats\nand traitors.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nA mountain has suddenly sprung up in the garden of the Tuileries. Under\na cloudless sky, Maximilien heads the procession of his colleagues in a\nblue coat and yellow breeches, carrying in his hand a bouquet of\nwheatears, cornflowers and poppies. He ascends the mountain and\nproclaims the God of Jean-Jacques to the Republic, which hears and\nweeps. Oh purity! oh sweetness! oh faith! oh antique simplicity! oh\ntears of pity! oh fertilizing dew! oh clemency! oh human fraternity!\n\nIn vain Atheism still lifts its hideous face; Maximilien grasps a torch;\nflames devour the monster and Wisdom appears, with one hand pointing to\nthe sky, in the other holding a crown of stars.\n\nOn the platform raised against the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the Tuileries, \u00c3\u0089variste,\nstanding amid a throng of deeply-stirred spectators, sheds tears of joy\nand renders thanks to God. An era of universal felicity opens before his\neyes.\n\nHe sighs:\n\n\"At last we shall be happy, pure, innocent, if the scoundrels suffer\nit.\"\n\nAlas! the scoundrels have not suffered it. There must be more\nexecutions; more torrents of tainted blood must be shed. Three days\nafter the festival celebrating the new alliance and the reconciliation\nof heaven and earth, the Convention promulgates the Law of Prairial\nwhich suppresses, with a sort of ferocious good-nature, all the\ntraditional forms of Law, whatever has been devised since the time of\nthe Roman jurisconsults for the safeguarding of innocence under\nsuspicion. No more sifting of evidence, no more questioning of the\naccused, no more witnesses, no more counsel for the defence; love of the\nfatherland supplies everything that is needful. The prisoner, who bears\nlocked up in his bosom his guilt or innocence, passes without a word\nallowed before the patriot jury, and it is in this brief moment they\nmust unravel his case, often complicated and obscure. How is justice\npossible? How distinguish in an instant between the honest man and the\nvillain, the patriot and the enemy of the fatherland...?\n\nDisconcerted for the moment, Gamelin quickly learned his new duties and\naccommodated himself to his new functions. He recognized that this\ncurtailment of formalities was genuinely characteristic of the new\njustice, at once salutary and terrifying, the administrators of which\nwere no longer ermined pedants leisurely weighing the _pros_ and\n_contras_ in their Gothic balances, but good sansculottes judging by\ninspiration and seeing the whole truth in a flash. When guarantees and\nprecautions would have undone everything, the impulses of an upright\nheart saved the situation. We must follow the promptings of Nature, the\ngood mother who never deceives; the heart must teach us to do judgment,\nand Gamelin made invocation to the manes of Jean-Jacques:\n\n\"Man of virtue, inspire me with the love of men, the ardent desire to\nregenerate humankind!\"\n\nHis colleagues, for the most part, felt with him. They were, first and\nforemost, simple people; and when the forms of law were simplified,\nthey felt more comfortable. Justice thus abbreviated satisfied them; the\npace was quickened, and no obstacles were left to fret them. They\nlimited themselves to an inquiry into the opinions of the accused, not\nconceiving it possible that anyone could think differently from\nthemselves except in pure perversity. Believing themselves the exclusive\npossessors of truth, wisdom, the quintessence of good, they attributed\nto their opponents nothing but error and evil. They felt themselves\nall-powerful; they envisaged God.\n\nThey saw God, these jurors of the Revolutionary Tribunal. The Supreme\nBeing, acknowledged by Maximilien, flooded them with His flames of\nlight. They loved, they believed.\n\nThe chair of the accused had been replaced by a vast platform able to\naccommodate fifty persons; the court only dealt with batches now. The\nPublic Prosecutor would often confound under the same charge or\nimplicate as accomplices individuals who met each other for the first\ntime before the Tribunal. The latter, taking advantage of the terrible\nfacilities accorded by the law of Prairial, sat in judgment on those\nsupposed prison plots which, coming after the proscriptions of the\nDantonists and the Commune, were made to seem their outcome by the\ninsinuations of cunning adversaries. In fact, to let the world\nappreciate the two essential characteristics of a conspiracy fomented by\nforeign gold against the Republic,--to wit inopportune moderation on the\none hand and self-interested excess of zeal on the other, they had\nunited in the same condemnation two very different women, the widow of\nCamille Desmoulins, poor lovable Lucille, and the widow of the H\u00c3\u00a9bertist\nMomoro, goddess of a day and jolly companion all her life. Both, to\nmake the analogy complete, had been shut up in the same prison, where\nthey had mingled their tears on the same bench; both, to round off the\nresemblance, had climbed the scaffold. Too ingenious the symbol,--a\nmasterpiece of equilibrium, conceived doubtless by a lawyer's brain, and\nthe honour of which was given to Maximilien. This representative of the\npeople was accredited with every eventuality, happy or unhappy, that\ncame about in the Republic, every change that was effected in the laws,\nin manners and morals, the very course of the seasons, the harvests, the\nincidence of epidemics. Unjust of course, but not unmerited the\ninjustice, for indeed the man, the little, spruce, cat-faced dandy, was\nall powerful with the people....\n\nThat day the Tribunal was clearing off a batch of prisoners involved in\nthe great plot, thirty or more conspirators from the Luxembourg,\nsubmissive enough in gaol, but Royalists or Federalists of the most\npronounced type. The prosecution relied almost entirely on the evidence\nof a single informer. The jurors did not know one word of the\nmatter,--not so much as the conspirators' names. Gamelin, casting his\neye over the prisoners' bench, recognized Fortun\u00c3\u00a9 Chassagne among the\naccused. Julie's lover, pale-faced and emaciated by long confinement and\nhis features showing coarser in the glare of light that flooded the\nhall, still retained traces of his old grace and proud bearing. His eyes\nmet Gamelin's and filled with scorn.\n\nGamelin, possessed by a calm fury, rose, asked leave to speak, and,\nfixing his eyes on the bust of Roman Brutus, which looked down on the\nTribunal:\n\n\"_Citoyen_ President,\" he said, \"although there may exist between one of\nthe accused and myself ties which, if they were made public, would be\nties of married kinship, I hereby declare I do not decline to act. The\ntwo Bruti did not decline their duty, when for the salvation of the\nstate and the cause of freedom, the one had to condemn a son, the other\nto strike down an adoptive father.\"\n\nHe resumed his seat.\n\n\"A fine scoundrel that,\" muttered Chassagne between his teeth.\n\nThe public remained cold, whether because it was tired of high-flown\ncharacters, or thinking that Gamelin had triumphed too easily over his\nfeelings of family affection.\n\n\"_Citoyen_ Gamelin,\" said the President, \"by the terms of the law, every\nrefusal must be formulated in writing within the twenty-four hours\npreceding the opening of the trial. In any case, you have no reason to\nrefuse; a patriot jury is superior to human passions.\"\n\nEach prisoner was questioned for three or four minutes, the examination\nresulting in a verdict of death in every instance. The jurors voted\nwithout a word said, by a nod of the head or by exclamation. When\nGamelin's turn came to pronounce his opinion:\n\n\"All the accused,\" he declared, \"are convicted, and the law is\nexplicit.\"\n\nAs he was descending the stairway of the Palais de Justice, a young man\ndressed in a bottle-green box-coat, and who looked seventeen or eighteen\nyears of age, stopped him abruptly as he went by. The lad wore a round\nhat, tilted on the back of his head, the brim framing his fine pale face\nin a dark aureole. Facing the juror, in a terrible voice vibrating with\npassion and despair:\n\n\"Villain, monster, murderer!\" he screamed. \"Strike me, coward! I am a\nwoman! Have me arrested, have me guillotined, Cain! I am your\nsister,\"--and Julie spat in his face.\n\nThe throng of _tricoteuses_ and _sansculottes_ was relaxing by this time\nin its Revolutionary vigilance; its civic zeal had largely cooled;\nGamelin and his assailant found themselves the centre of nothing worse\nthan uproar and confusion. Julie fought a way through the press and\ndisappeared in the dark.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin was worn out and could not rest; twenty times in the\nnight he would awake with a start from a sleep haunted by nightmares. It\nwas only in the blue chamber, in \u00c3\u0089lodie's arms, that he could snatch a\nfew hours' slumber. He talked and cried out in his sleep and used often\nto awake her; but she could make nothing of what he said.\n\nOne morning, after a night when he had seen the Eumenides, he started\nawake, broken with terror and weak as a child. The dawn was piercing the\nwindow curtains with its wan arrows. \u00c3\u0089variste's hair, lying tangled on\nhis brow, covered his eyes with a black veil; \u00c3\u0089lodie, by the bedside,\nwas gently parting the wild locks. She was looking at him now, with a\nsister's tenderness, while with her handkerchief she wiped away the icy\nsweat from the unhappy man's forehead. Then he remembered that fine\nscene in the _Orestes_ of Euripides, which he had essayed to represent\nin a picture that, if he could have finished it, would have been his\nmasterpiece--the scene where the unhappy Electra wipes away the spume\nthat sullies her brother's lips. And he seemed to hear \u00c3\u0089lodie also\nsaying in a gentle voice:\n\n\"Hear me, beloved brother, while the Furies leave you master of your\nreason ...\"\n\nAnd he thought:\n\n\"And yet I am no parricide. Far from it, it is filial piety has made me\nshed the tainted blood of the enemies of my fatherland.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nThere seemed no end to these trials for conspiracy in the prisons.\nForty-nine accused crowded the tiers of seats. Maurice Brotteaux\noccupied the right-hand corner of the topmost row,--the place of honour.\nHe was dressed in his plum-coloured surtout, which he had brushed very\ncarefully the day before and mended at the pocket where his little\nLucretius had ended by fretting a hole. Beside him sat the woman\nRochemaure, painted and powdered and patched, a brilliant and ghastly\nfigure. They had put the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare between her and the girl\nAthena\u00c3\u00afs, who had recovered her look of youthful freshness at the\nMadelonnettes.\n\nOn the platform the gendarmes massed a number of other prisoners unknown\nto any of our friends, and who, as likely as not, knew nothing of each\nother,--yet accomplices one and all,--lawyers, journalists, _ci-devant_\nnobles, citizens, and citizens' wives. The _citoyenne_ Rochemaure caught\nsight of Gamelin on the jurors' bench. He had not answered her urgent\nletters and repeated messages; still she had not abandoned hope and\nthrew him a look of supplication, trying to appear fascinating and\npathetic for him. But the young juror's cold glance robbed her of any\nillusion she might have entertained.\n\nThe Clerk read the act of accusation, which, succinct as was its\nreference to each individual, was a lengthy document because of the\ngreat number accused. It began by exposing in general outline the plot\nconcocted in the prisons to drown the Republic in the blood of the\nRepresentatives of the nation and the people of Paris; then, coming to\neach severally, it went on:\n\n\"One of the most mischievous authors of this abominable conspiracy is\nthe man Brotteaux, once known as des Ilettes, receiver of imposts under\nthe tyrant. This person, who was remarkable, even in the days of\ntyranny, for his libertine behaviour, is a sure proof how dissoluteness\nand immorality are the greatest enemies of the liberty and happiness of\npeoples; as a fact, after misappropriating the public revenues and\nwasting in debauchery a noticeable part of the people's patrimony, the\nperson in question connived with his former concubine, the woman\nRochemaure, to enter into correspondence with the _\u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s_ and\ntraitorously keep the faction of the foreigner informed of the state of\nour finances, the movements of our troops, the fluctuations of public\nopinion.\n\n\"Brotteaux, who, at this period of his despicable life, was living in\nconcubinage with a prostitute he had picked up in the mud of the Rue\nFromenteau, the girl Athena\u00c3\u00afs, easily suborned her to his purposes and\nmade use of her to foment the counterrevolution by impudent and\nunpatriotic cries and indecent and traitorous speeches.\n\n\"Sundry remarks of this ill-omened individual will afford you a clear\nindication of his abject views and pernicious purpose. Speaking of the\npatriotic tribunal now called upon to punish him, he declared\ninsultingly,--'The Revolutionary Tribunal is like a play of William\nShakespeare, who mixes up with the most bloodthirsty scenes the most\ntrivial buffooneries.' Then he was forever preaching atheism, as the\nsurest means of degrading the people and driving it into immorality. In\nthe prison of the Conciergerie, where he was confined, he used to\ndeplore as among the worst of calamities the victories of our valiant\narmies, and tried to throw suspicion on the most patriotic Generals,\ncrediting them with designs of tyrannicide. 'Only wait,' he would say in\natrocious language which the pen is loath to reproduce, 'only wait till,\nsome day, one of these warriors, to whom you owe your salvation,\nswallows you all up as the stork in the fable gobbled up the frogs.'\n\n\"The woman Rochemaure, a _ci-devant_ noble, concubine of Brotteaux, is\nnot less culpable than he. Not only was she in correspondence with the\nforeigner and in the pay of Pitt himself, but in complicity with\nswindlers, such as Jullien (of Toulouse) and Chabot, associates of the\n_ci-devant_ Baron de Batz, she seconded that reprobate in all sorts of\ncunning machinations to depreciate the shares of the Company of the\nIndies, buy them in at a cheap price, and then raise the quotation by\nartifices of an opposite tendency, to the confusion and ruin of private\nfortunes and of the public funds. Incarcerated at La Bourbe and the\nMadelonnettes, she never ceased in prison to conspire, to dabble in\nstocks and shares and to devote herself to attempts at corruption, to\nsuborn judges and jury.\n\n\"Louis Longuemare, ex-noble, ex-capuchin, had long been practised in\ninfamy and crime before committing the acts of treason for which he has\nto answer here. Living in a shameful promiscuity with the girl Gorcut,\nknown as Athena\u00c3\u00afs, under Brotteaux's very roof, he is the accomplice of\nthe said girl and the said _ci-devant_ nobleman. During his\nimprisonment at the Conciergerie he has never ceased for one single day\nwriting pamphlets aimed at the subversion of public liberty and\nsecurity.\n\n\"It is right to say, with regard to Marthe Gorcut, known as Athena\u00c3\u00afs,\nthat prostitutes are the greatest scourge of public morality, which they\ninsult, and the opprobrium of the society which they disgrace. But why\nspeak at length of revolting crimes which the accused confesses\nshamelessly...?\"\n\nThe accusation then proceeded to pass in review the fifty-four other\nprisoners, none of whom either Brotteaux, or the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, or the\n_citoyenne_ Rochemaure, were acquainted with, except for having seen\nseveral of them in the prisons, but who were one and all included with\nthe first named in \"this odious plot, with which the annals of the\nnation can furnish nothing to compare.\"\n\nThe piece concluded by demanding the penalty of death for all the\nculprits.\n\nBrotteaux was the first to be examined:\n\n\"You were in the plot?\"\n\n\"No, I have been in no plots. Every word is untrue in the act of\naccusation I have just heard read.\"\n\n\"There, you see; you are plotting still, at this moment, to discredit\nthe Tribunal,\"--and the President went on to the woman Rochemaure, who\nanswered with despairing protestations of innocence, tears and\nquibblings.\n\nThe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare referred himself purely and entirely to God's will.\nHe had not even brought his written defence with him.\n\nAll the questions put to him he answered in a spirit of resignation.\nOnly, when the President spoke of him as a Capuchin, did the old Adam\nwake again in him:\n\n\"I am not a Capuchin,\" he said, \"I am a priest and a monk of the Order\nof the Barnabites.\"\n\n\"It is the same thing,\" returned the President good-naturedly.\n\nThe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare looked at him indignantly:\n\n\"One cannot conceive a more extraordinary error,\" he cried, \"than to\nconfound with a Capuchin a monk of this Order of the Barnabites which\nderives its constitutions from the Apostle Paul himself.\"\n\nThe remark was greeted with a burst of laughter and hooting from the\nspectators, at which the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, taking this derision to\nbetoken a denial of his proposition, announced that he would die a\nmember of this Order of St. Barnabas, the habit of which he wore in his\nheart.\n\n\"Do you admit,\" asked the President, \"entering into plots with the girl\nGorcut, known as Athena\u00c3\u00afs, the same who accorded you her despicable\nfavours?\"\n\nAt the question, the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare raised his eyes sorrowfully to\nheaven, but made no answer; his silence expressed the surprise of an\nunsophisticated mind and the gravity of a man of religion who fears to\nutter empty words.\n\n\"You, the girl Gorcut,\" the President asked, turning to Athena\u00c3\u00afs, \"do\nyou admit plotting in conjunction with Brotteaux?\"\n\nHer answer was softly spoken:\n\n\"Monsieur Brotteaux, to my knowledge, has done nothing but good. He is a\nman of the sort we should have more of; there is no better sort. Those\nwho say the contrary are mistaken. That is all I have to say.\"\n\nThe President asked her if she admitted having lived in concubinage\nwith Brotteaux. The expression had to be explained to her, as she did\nnot understand it. But, directly she gathered what the question meant,\nshe answered, that would only have depended on him, but he had never\nasked her.\n\nThere was a laugh in the public galleries, and the President threatened\nthe girl Gorcut to refuse her a hearing if she answered in such a\ncynical sort again.\n\nAt this she broke out, calling him sneak, sour face, cuckold, and\nspewing out over him, judges, and jury a torrent of invective, till the\ngendarmes dragged her from her bench and hustled her out of the hall.\n\nThe President then proceeded to a brief examination of the rest of the\naccused, taking them in the order in which they sat on the tiers of\nbenches.\n\nOne, a man named Navette, pleaded that he could not have plotted in\nprison where he had only spent four days. The President observed that\nthe point deserved to be considered, and begged the _citoyens_ of the\njury to make a note of it. A certain Bellier said the same, and the\nPresident made the same remark to the jury in his favour. This mildness\non the judge's part was interpreted by some as the result of a\npraiseworthy scrupulosity, by others as payment due in recognition of\ntheir talents as informers.\n\nThe Deputy of the Public Prosecutor spoke next. All he did was to\namplify the details of the act of accusation and then to put the\nquestion:\n\n\"Is it proven that Maurice Brotteaux, Louise Rochemaure, Louis\nLonguemare, Marthe Gorcut, known as Athena\u00c3\u00afs, Eus\u00c3\u00a8be Rocher, Pierre\nGuyton-Fabulet, Marcelline Descourtis, etc., etc., are guilty of\nforming a conspiracy, the means whereof are assassination, starvation,\nthe making of forged assignats and false coin, the depravation of morals\nand public spirit; the aim and object, civil war, the abolition of the\nNational representation, the re-establishment of Royalty?\"\n\nThe jurors withdrew into the chamber of deliberation. They voted\nunanimously in the affirmative, only excepting the cases of the\nafore-named Navette and Bellier, whom the President, and following his\nlead, the Public Prosecutor, had put, as it were, in a separate class by\nthemselves.\n\nGamelin stated the motives for his decision thus:\n\n\"The guilt of the accused is self-evident; the safety of the Nation\ndemands their chastisement, and they ought themselves to desire their\npunishment as the only means of expiating their crimes.\"\n\nThe President pronounced sentence in the absence of those it concerned.\nIn these great days, contrary to what the law prescribed, the condemned\nwere not called back again to hear their judgment read, no doubt for\nfear of the effects of despair on so large a number of prisoners. A\nneedless apprehension, so extraordinary and so general was the\nsubmissiveness of the victims in those days! The Clerk of the Court came\ndown to the cells to read the verdict, which was listened to with such\nsilence and impassivity as made it a common comparison to liken the\ncondemned of Prairial to trees marked down for felling.\n\nThe _citoyenne_ Rochemaure declared herself pregnant. A surgeon, who was\nlikewise one of the jury, was directed to see her. She was carried out\nfainting to her dungeon.\n\n\"Ah!\" sighed the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, \"these judges and jurors are men very\ndeserving of pity; their state of mind is truly deplorable. They mix up\neverything and confound a Barnabite with a Franciscan.\"\n\nThe execution was to take place the same day at the _Barri\u00c3\u00a8re du\nTrone-Renvers\u00c3\u00a9_. The condemned, their toilet completed, hair cropped and\nshirt cut down at the neck, waited for the headsman, packed like cattle\nin the small room separated off from the Gaoler's office by a glazed\npartition.\n\nWhen presently the executioner and his men arrived, Brotteaux, who was\nquietly reading his Lucretius, put the marker at the page he had begun,\nshut the book, stuffed it in the pocket of his coat, and said to the\nBarnabite:\n\n\"What enrages me, Reverend Father, is that I shall never convince you.\nWe are going both of us to sleep our last sleep, and I shall not be able\nto twitch you by the sleeve and tell you: 'There you see; you have\nneither sensation nor consciousness left; you are inanimate. What comes\nafter life is like what goes before.'\"\n\nHe tried to smile; but an atrocious spasm of pain wrung his heart and\nvitals, and he came near fainting.\n\nHe resumed, however:\n\n\"Father, I let you see my weakness. I love life and I do not leave it\nwithout regret.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the monk gently, \"take heed, you are a braver man than I,\nand nevertheless death troubles you more. What does that mean, if not\nthat I see the light, which you do not see yet?\"\n\n\"Might it not also be,\" said Brotteaux, \"that I regret life because I\nhave enjoyed it better than you, who have made it as close a copy of\ndeath as possible?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare, his face paling, \"this is a solemn\nmoment. God help me! It is plain we shall die without spiritual aid. It\nmust be that in other days I have received the sacraments lukewarmly and\nwith a thankless heart, for Heaven to refuse me them to-day, when I have\nsuch pressing need of them.\"\n\nThe carts were waiting. The condemned were loaded into them pell-mell,\nwith hands tied. The woman Rochemaure, whose pregnancy had not been\nverified by the surgeon, was hoisted into one of the tumbrils. She\nrecovered a little of her old energy to watch the crowd of onlookers,\nhoping against hope to find rescuers amongst them. The throng was less\ndense than formerly, and the excitement less extreme. Only a few women\nscreamed, \"Death! death!\" or mocked those who were to die. The men\nmostly shrugged their shoulders, looked another way, and said nothing,\nwhether out of prudence or from respect of the laws.\n\nA shudder went through the crowd when Athena\u00c3\u00afs emerged from the wicket.\nShe looked a mere child.\n\nShe bowed her head before the monk:\n\n\"Monsieur le Cur\u00c3\u00a9,\" she asked him, \"give me absolution.\"\n\nThe P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare gravely recited the sacramental words in muttered\ntones; then:\n\n\"My daughter!\" he added, \"you have fallen into great disorders of\nliving; but can I offer the Lord a heart as simple as yours? Would I\nwere sure!\"\n\nShe climbed lightly into the cart. And there, throwing out her bosom and\nproudly lifting her girlish head, she cried \"Vive le Roi!\"\n\nShe made a little sign to Brotteaux to show him there was a vacant place\nbeside her. Brotteaux helped the Barnabite to get in and came and\nplaced himself between the monk and the simple-hearted girl.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the P\u00c3\u00a8re Longuemare to the Epicurean philosopher, \"I ask you\na favour; this God in whom you do not yet believe, pray to Him for me.\nIt is far from sure you are not nearer to Him than I am myself; a moment\ncan decide this. A second, and you may be called by the Lord to be His\nhighly favoured son. Sir, pray for me.\"\n\nWhile the wheels were grinding over the pavement of the long Faubourg\nAntoine, the monk was busy, with heart and lips, reciting the prayers of\nthe dying. Brotteaux's mind was fixed on recalling the lines of the poet\nof nature: _Sic ubi non erimus_.... Bound as he was and shaken in the\nvile, jolting cart, he preserved his calm and even showed a certain\nsolicitude to maintain an easy posture. At his side, Athena\u00c3\u00afs, proud to\ndie like the Queen of France, surveyed the crowd with haughty looks, and\nthe old financier, noting as a connoisseur the girl's white bosom, was\nfilled with regret for the light of day.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\nWhile the carts, escorted by gendarmes, were rumbling along on their way\nto the Place du Tr\u00c3\u00b4ne Renvers\u00c3\u00a9, carrying to their death Brotteaux and\nhis \"accomplices,\" \u00c3\u0089variste sat pensive on a bench in the garden of the\nTuileries. He was waiting for \u00c3\u0089lodie. The sun, nearing its setting, shot\nits fiery darts through the leafy chestnuts. At the gate of the garden,\nFame on her winged horse blew her everlasting trumpet. The newspaper\nhawkers were bawling the news of the great victory of Fleurus.\n\n\"Yes,\" thought Gamelin, \"victory is ours. We have paid full price for\nit.\"\n\nHe could see the beaten Generals, disconsolate shades, trailing in the\nblood-stained dust of yonder Place de la R\u00c3\u00a9volution where they perished.\nAnd he smiled proudly, reflecting that, but for the severities in which\nhe had borne his share, the Austrian horses would to-day be gnawing the\nbark of the trees beside him.\n\nHe soliloquized:\n\n\"Life-giving terror, oh! blessed terror! Last year at this time, our\nheroic defenders were beaten and in rags, the soil of the fatherland was\ninvaded, two-thirds of the departments in revolt. Now our armies, well\nequipped, well trained, commanded by able generals, are taking the\noffensive, ready to bear liberty through the world. Peace reigns over\nall the territory of the Republic.... Life-giving terror, oh! blessed\nterror! oh! saintly guillotine! Last year at this time, the Republic was\ntorn with factions, the hydra of Federalism threatened to devour her.\nNow a united Jacobinism spreads over the empire its might and its\nwisdom....\"\n\nNevertheless, he was gloomy. His brow was deeply lined, his mouth\nbitter. His thoughts ran: \"We used to say: _To conquer or to die._ We\nwere wrong; it is _to conquer and to die_ we ought to say.\"\n\nHe looked about him. Children were building sand-castles. _Citoyennes_\nin their wooden chairs under the trees were sewing or embroidering. The\npassers-by, in coat and breeches of elegant cut and strange fashion,\ntheir thoughts fixed on their business or their pleasures, were making\nfor home. And Gamelin felt himself alone amongst them; he was no\ncompatriot, no contemporary of theirs. What was it had happened? How\ncame the enthusiasm of the great years to have been succeeded by\nindifference, weariness, perhaps disgust? It was plain to see, these\npeople never wanted to hear the Revolutionary Tribunal spoken of again\nand averted their eyes from the guillotine. Grown too painful a sight in\nthe Place de la R\u00c3\u00a9volution, it had been banished to the extremity of the\nFaubourg Antoine. There even, the passage of the tumbrils was greeted\nwith murmurs. Voices, it was said, had been heard to shout: \"Enough!\"\n\nEnough, when there were still traitors, conspirators! Enough, when the\nCommittees must be reformed, the Convention purged! Enough, when\nscoundrels disgraced the National representation. Enough, when they were\nplanning the downfall of _The Just!_ For, dreadful thought, but only too\ntrue! Fouquier himself was weaving plots, and it was to ruin Maximilien\nthat he had sacrificed with solemn ceremony fifty-seven victims haled to\ndeath in the red sheet of parricides. France was giving way to pity--and\npity was a crime! Then we should have saved her in spite of herself, and\nwhen she cried for mercy, stopped our ears and struck! Alas! the fates\nhad decided otherwise; the fatherland was for cursing its saviours.\nWell, let it curse, if only it may be saved!\n\n\"It is not enough to immolate obscure victims, aristocrats, financiers,\npublicists, poets, a Lavoisier, a Roucher, an Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Ch\u00c3\u00a9nier. We must\nstrike these all-puissant malefactors who, with hands full of gold and\ndripping with blood, are plotting the ruin of _the Mountain_--the\nFouchers, Talliens, Rov\u00c3\u00a8res, Carriers, Bourdons. We must deliver the\nState from all its enemies. If H\u00c3\u00a9bert had triumphed, the Convention was\noverthrown, the Republic hastening to the abyss; if Desmoulins and\nDanton had triumphed, the Convention had lost its virtue, ready to\nsurrender the Republic to the aristocrats, the money-jobbers and the\nGenerals. If men like Tallien and Foucher, monsters gorged with blood\nand rapine, triumph, France is overwhelmed in a welter of crime and\ninfamy ... Robespierre, awake; when criminals, drunken with fury and\naffright, plan your death and the death of freedom! Couthon, Saint-Just,\nmake haste; why tarry ye to denounce the plots?\n\n\"Why! the old-time state, the Royal monster, assured its empire by\nimprisoning every year four hundred thousand persons, by hanging fifteen\nthousand, by breaking three thousand on the wheel--and the Republic\nstill hesitates to sacrifice a few hundred heads for its security and\ndomination! Let us drown in blood and save the fatherland....\"\n\nHe was buried in these thoughts when \u00c3\u0089lodie hurried up to him,\npale-faced and distraught:\n\n\"\u00c3\u0089variste, what have you to say to me? Why not come to the _Amour\npeintre_ to the blue chamber? Why have you made me come here?\"\n\n\"To bid you an eternal farewell.\"\n\nHe had lost his wits, she faltered, she could not understand....\n\nHe stopped her with a very slight movement of the hand:\n\n\"\u00c3\u0089lodie, I cannot any more accept your love.\"\n\nShe begged him to walk on further; people could see them, overhear them,\nwhere they were.\n\nHe moved on a score of yards, and resumed, very quietly:\n\n\"I have made sacrifices to my country of my life and my honour. I shall\ndie infamous; I shall have naught to leave you, unhappy girl, save an\nexecrated memory.... We, love? Can anyone love me still?... Can I love?\"\n\nShe told him he was mad; that she loved him, that she would always love\nhim. She was ardent, sincere; but she felt as well as he, she felt\nbetter than he, that he was right. But she fought against the evidence\nof her senses.\n\nHe went on:\n\n\"I blame myself for nothing. What I have done, I would do again. I have\nmade myself anathema for my country's sake. I am accursed. I have put\nmyself outside humanity; I shall never re-enter its pale. No, the great\ntask is not finished. Oh! clemency, forgiveness!--Do the traitors\nforgive? Are the conspirators clement? scoundrels, parricides multiply\nunceasingly; they spring up from underground, they swarm in from all our\nfrontiers,--young men, who would have done better to perish with our\narmies, old men, children, women, with every mark of innocence, purity,\nand grace. They are offered up a sacrifice,--and more victims are ready\nfor the knife!... You can see, \u00c3\u0089lodie, I must needs renounce love,\nrenounce all joy, all sweetness of life, renounce life itself.\"\n\nHe fell silent. Born to taste tranquil joys, \u00c3\u0089lodie not for the first\ntime was appalled to find, under the tragic kisses of a lover like\n\u00c3\u0089variste, her voluptuous transports blended with images of horror and\nbloodshed; she offered no reply. To \u00c3\u0089variste the girl's silence was as a\ndraught of a bitter chalice.\n\n\"Yes, you can see, \u00c3\u0089lodie, we are on a precipice; our deeds devour us.\nOur days, our hours are years. I shall soon have lived a century. Look\nat this brow! Is it a lover's? Love!...\"\n\n\"\u00c3\u0089variste, you are mine, I will not let you go; I will not give you back\nyour freedom.\"\n\nShe was speaking in the language of sacrifice. He felt it; she felt it\nherself.\n\n\"Will you be able, \u00c3\u0089lodie, one day to bear witness that I lived faithful\nto my duty, that my heart was upright and my soul unsullied, that I knew\nno passion but the public good; that I was born to feel and love? Will\nyou say: 'He did his duty'? But no! You will not say it and I do not ask\nyou to say it. Perish my memory! My glory is in my own heart; shame\nbeleaguers me about. If you love me, never speak my name; eternal\nsilence is best.\"\n\nA child of eight or nine, trundling its hoop, ran just then between\nGamelin's legs.\n\nHe lifted the boy suddenly in his arms:\n\n\"Child, you will grow up free, happy, and you will owe it to the\ninfamous Gamelin. I am ferocious, that you may be happy. I am cruel,\nthat you may be kind; I am pitiless, that to-morrow all Frenchmen may\nembrace with tears of joy.\"\n\nHe pressed the child to his breast.\n\n\"Little one, when you are a man, you will owe your happiness, your\ninnocence to me; and, if ever you hear my name uttered, you will\nexecrate it.\"\n\nThen he put down the child, which ran away in terror to cling to its\nmother's skirts, who had hurried up to the rescue. The young mother, who\nwas pretty and charming in her aristocratic grace, with her gown of\nwhite lawn, carried off the boy with a haughty look.\n\nGamelin turned his eyes on \u00c3\u0089lodie:\n\n\"I have held the child in my arms; perhaps I shall send the mother to\nthe guillotine,\"--and he walked away with long strides under the ordered\ntrees.\n\n\u00c3\u0089lodie stood a moment motionless, her eyes fixed on the ground. Then,\nsuddenly, she darted after her lover, and frenzied, dishevelled, like a\nM\u00c3\u00a6nad, she gripped him as if to tear him in pieces and cried in a voice\nchoked with blood and tears:\n\n\"Well, then! me too, my beloved, send me to the guillotine; me too, lay\nme under the knife!\"\n\nAnd, at the thought of the knife at her neck, all her flesh melted in an\necstasy of horror and voluptuous transport.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n\nThe sun of Thermidor was setting in a blood-red sky, while \u00c3\u0089variste\nwandered, gloomy and careworn, in the Marbeuf gardens, now a National\npark frequented by the Parisian idlers. There were stalls for the sale\nof lemonade and ices; wooden horses and shooting-galleries were provided\nfor the younger patriots. Under a tree, a little Savoyard in rags, with\na black cap on his head, was making a marmot dance to the shrill notes\nof his hurdy-gurdy. A man, still young, slim-waisted, wearing a blue\ncoat and his hair powdered, with a big dog at his heels, stopped to\nlisten to the rustic music. \u00c3\u0089variste recognized Robespierre. He found\nhim paler, thinner, his face harder and drawn in folds of suffering. He\nthought to himself:\n\n\"What fatigues, how many griefs have left their imprint on his brow! How\ngrievous a thing it is to work for the happiness of mankind! What are\nhis thoughts at this moment? Does the sound of this mountain music\nperhaps distract him from the cares of government? Is he thinking that\nhe has made a pact with Death and that the hour of reckoning is coming\nclose? Is he dreaming of a triumphant return to the Committee of Public\nSafety, from which he withdrew, weary of being held in check, with\nCouthon and Saint-Just, by a seditious majority? Behind that\nimpenetrable countenance what hopes are seething or what fears?\"\n\nBut Maximilien smiled at the lad, in a gentle, kind voice asked him\nseveral questions about his native valley, the humble home and parents\nthe poor child had left behind, tossed him a small piece of silver and\nresumed his stroll. After taking a few steps, he turned round again to\ncall his dog; sniffing at the marmot, it was showing its teeth at the\nlittle creature that bristled up in defiance.\n\n\"To heel, Brount!\" he called, \"to heel!\"--and he plunged among the dark\ntrees.\n\nGamelin, out of respect, did not interrupt his lonely walk; but, as he\ngazed after the slender form disappearing in the darkness, he mentally\naddressed his hero in these impassioned words:\n\n\"I have seen thy sadness, Maximilien; I have understood thy thought. Thy\nmelancholy, thy fatigue, even the look of fear that stamps thy face,\neverything says: 'Let the reign of terror end and that of fraternity\nbegin! Frenchmen, be united, be virtuous, be good and kind. Love ye one\nanother....' Well then, I will second your designs; that you, in your\nwisdom and goodness, may be able to put an end to our civil discord, to\nour fratricidal hate, turn the headsman into a gardener who will\nhenceforth cut off only the heads of cabbages and lettuces. I will pave\nthe way with my colleagues of the Tribunal that must lead to clemency by\nexterminating conspirators and traitors. We will redouble our vigilance\nand our severity. No culprit shall escape us. And when the head of the\nlast enemy of the Republic shall have fallen under the knife, then it\nwill be given thee to be merciful without committing a crime, then thou\ncanst inaugurate the reign of innocence and virtue in all the land, oh!\nfather of thy country!\"\n\nThe Incorruptible was already almost out of sight. Two men in round hats\nand nankeen breeches, one of whom, a tall, lean man of a wild, unkempt\naspect, had a blur on one eye and resembled Tallien, met him at the\ncorner of an avenue, looked at him askance and passed on, pretending not\nto recognize him. When they had gone far enough to be out of hearing,\nthey muttered under their breath:\n\n\"So there he goes, the King, the Pope, the God. For he is God; and\nCatherine Th\u00c3\u00a9ot is his prophetess.\"\n\n\"Dictator, traitor, tyrant! the race of Brutus is not extinct.\"\n\n\"Tremble, malefactor! the Tarpeian rock is near the Capitol!\"\n\nThe dog Brount ran towards the pair. They said no more and quickened\ntheir pace.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n\nRobespierre, awake! The hour is come, time presses,... soon it will be\ntoo late....\n\nAt last, on the 8 Thermidor, in the Convention, the Incorruptible rises,\nhe is going to speak. Sun of the 31st May, is this to be a second\nday-spring? Gamelin waits and hopes. His mind is made up then!\nRobespierre is to drag from the benches they dishonour these legislators\nmore guilty than the federalists, more dangerous than Danton.... No! not\nyet. \"I cannot,\" he says, \"resolve to clear away entirely the veil that\nhides this mystery of iniquity.\"\n\nIt is mere summer lightning that flashes harmlessly and without striking\nany one of the conspirators, terrifies all. Sixty of them at least for a\nfortnight had not dared sleep in their beds. Marat's way was to denounce\ntraitors by their name, to point the finger of accusation at\nconspirators. The Incorruptible hesitates, and from that moment he is\nthe accused....\n\nThat evening at the Jacobins, the hall is filled to suffocation, the\ncorridors, the courtyard are crowded.\n\nThey are all there, loud-voiced friends and silent enemies. Robespierre\nreads them the speech the Convention had heard in affrighted silence,\nand the Jacobins greet it with excited applause.\n\n\"It is my dying testament,\" declares the orator. \"You will see me drain\nthe hemlock undismayed.\"\n\n\"I will drink it with you,\" answered David.\n\n\"All, we all will!\" shout the Jacobins, and separate without deciding\nanything.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste, while the death of _The Just_ was preparing, slept the sleep\nof the Disciples in the garden of Gethsemane. Next day, he attended the\nTribunal where two sections were sitting. That on which he served was\ntrying twenty-one persons implicated in the conspiracy of the Lazare\nprison. The case was still proceeding when the tidings arrived:\n\n\"The Convention, after a six-hours' session, has decreed Maximilien\nRobespierre accused,--with him Couthon and Saint-Just; add Augustin\nRobespierre, and Lebas, who have demanded to share the lot of the\naccused. The five outlaws stand at the bar of the house.\"\n\nNews is brought that the President of the Section sitting in the next\ncourt, the _citoyen_ Dumas, has been arrested on the bench, but that the\ncase goes on. Drums can be heard beating the alarm, and the tocsin peals\nfrom the churches.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste is still in his place when he is handed an order from the\nCommune to proceed to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville to sit in the General Council.\nTo the sound of the rolling drums and clanging church bells, he and his\ncolleagues record their verdict; then he hurries home to embrace his\nmother and snatch up his scarf of office. The Place de Thionville is\ndeserted. The Section is afraid to declare either for or against the\nConvention. Wayfarers creep along under the walls, slip down\nside-streets, sneak indoors. The call of the tocsin and alarm-drums is\nanswered by the noise of barring shutters and bolting doors. The\n_citoyen_ Dupont senior has secreted himself in his shop; Remacle the\nporter is barricaded in his lodge. Little Jos\u00c3\u00a9phine holds Mouton\ntremblingly in her arms. The widow Gamelin bemoans the dearness of\nvictuals, cause of all the trouble. At the foot of the stairs \u00c3\u0089variste\nencounters \u00c3\u0089lodie; she is panting for breath and her black locks are\nplastered on her hot cheek.\n\n\"I have been to look for you at the Tribunal; but you had just left.\nWhere are you going?\"\n\n\"To the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville.\"\n\n\"Don't go there! It would be your ruin; Hanriot is arrested ... the\nSections will not stir. The _Section des Piques_, Robespierre's Section,\nwill do nothing, I know it for a fact; my father belongs to it. If you\ngo to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville, you are throwing away your life for nothing.\"\n\n\"You wish me to be a coward?\"\n\n\"No! the brave thing is to be faithful to the Convention and to obey the\nLaw.\"\n\n\"The law is dead when malefactors triumph.\"\n\n\"\u00c3\u0089variste, hear me; hear your \u00c3\u0089lodie; hear your sister. Come and sit\nbeside her and let her soothe your angry spirit.\"\n\nHe looked at her; never had she seemed so desirable in his eyes; never\nhad her voice sounded so seductive, so persuasive in his ears.\n\n\"A couple of paces, only a couple of paces, dear \u00c3\u0089variste!\"--and she\ndrew him towards the raised platform on which stood the pedestal of the\noverthrown statue. It was surrounded by benches occupied by strollers of\nboth sexes. A dealer in fancy articles was offering his laces, a seller\nof cooling drinks, his portable cistern on his back, was tinkling his\nbell; little girls were showing off their airs and graces. The parapet\nwas lined with anglers, standing, rod in hand, very still. The weather\nwas stormy, the sky overcast. Gamelin leant on the low wall and looked\ndown on the islet below, pointed like the prow of a ship, listening to\nthe wind whistling in the tree-tops, and feeling his soul penetrated\nwith an infinite longing for peace and solitude.\n\nLike a sweet echo of his thoughts, \u00c3\u0089lodie's voice sighed in his ear:\n\n\"Do you remember, \u00c3\u0089variste, how, at sight of the green fields, you\nwanted to be a country justice in a village? Yes, that would be\nhappiness.\"\n\nBut above the rustling of the trees and the girl's voice, he could hear\nthe tocsin and alarm-drums, the distant tramp of horses, and rumbling of\ncannon along the streets.\n\nTwo steps from them a young man, who was talking to an elegantly attired\n_citoyenne_, remarked:\n\n\"Have you heard the latest?... The Opera is installed in the Rue de la\nLoi.\"\n\nMeantime the news was spreading; Robespierre's name was spoken, but in a\nshuddering whisper, for men feared him still. Women, when they heard the\nmuttered rumour of his fall, concealed a smile.\n\n\u00c3\u0089variste Gamelin seized \u00c3\u0089lodie's hand, but dropped it again swiftly next\nmoment:\n\n\"Farewell! I have involved you in my hideous fortunes, I have blasted\nyour life for ever. Farewell! I pray you may forget me!\"\n\n\"Whatever you do,\" she warned him, \"do not go back home to-night. Come\nto the _Amour peintre_. Do not ring; throw a pebble at my shutters. I\nwill come and open the door to you myself; I will hide you in the\nloft.\"\n\n\"You shall see me return triumphant, or you shall never see me more.\nFarewell!\"\n\nOn nearing the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville, he caught the well-remembered roar of the\nold great days rising to the grey heavens. In the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve a clash\nof arms, the glitter of scarfs and uniforms, Hanriot's cannon drawn up.\nHe mounts the grand stairs and, entering the Council Hall, signs the\nattendance book. The Council General of the Commune, by the unanimous\nvoice of the 491 members present, declares for the outlawed patriots.\n\nThe Mayor sends for the Table of the Rights of Man, reads the clause\nwhich runs, \"When the Government violates the Rights of the people,\ninsurrection is for the people the most sacred and the most\nindispensable of duties,\" and the first magistrate of Paris announces\nthat the Commune's answer to the Convention's act of violence is to\nraise the populace in insurrection.\n\nThe members of the Council General take oath to die at their posts. Two\nmunicipal officers are deputed to go out on the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve and\ninvite the people to join with their magistrates in saving the\nfatherland and freedom.\n\nThere is an endless looking for friends, exchanging news, giving advice.\nAmong these Magistrates, artisans are the exception. The Commune\nassembled here is such as the Jacobin purge has made it,--judges and\njurors of the Revolutionary Tribunal, artists like Beauvallet and\nGamelin, householders living on their means and college professors, cosy\ncitizens, well-to-do tradesmen, powdered heads, fat paunches, and gold\nwatch-chains, very few sabots, striped trousers, carmagnole smocks and\nred caps.\n\nThese bourgeois councillors are numerous and determined, but, when all\nis said, they are pretty well all Paris possesses of true Republicans.\nThey stand on guard in the city mansion-house, as on a rock of liberty,\nbut an ocean of indifference washes round their refuge.\n\nHowever, good news arrives. All the prisons where the proscribed had\nbeen confined open their doors and disgorge their prey. Augustin\nRobespierre, coming from La Force, is the first to enter the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de\nVille and is welcomed with acclamation.\n\nAt eight o'clock it is announced that Maximilien, after a protracted\nresistance, is on his way to the Commune. He is eagerly expected; he is\ncoming; he is here; a roar of triumph shakes the vault of the old\nMunicipal Palace.\n\nHe enters, supported by twenty arms. It is he, the little man there,\nslim, spruce, in blue coat and yellow breeches. He takes his seat; he\nspeaks.\n\nAt his arrival the Council orders the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville to be\nilluminated there and then. It is there the Republic resides. He speaks\nin a thin voice, in picked phrases. He speaks lucidly, copiously. His\nhearers who have staked their lives on his head, see the naked truth,\nsee it to their horror. He is a man of words, a man of committees, a\nwind-bag incapable of prompt action, incompetent to lead a Revolution.\n\nThey draw him into the Hall of Deliberation. Now they are all there,\nthese illustrious outlaws,--Lebas, Saint-Just, Couthon. Robespierre has\nthe word. It is midnight and past, he is still speaking. Meantime\nGamelin in the Council Hall, his bent brow pressed against a window,\nlooks out with a haggard eye and sees the lamps flare and smoke in the\ngloom. Hanriot's cannon are parked before the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville. In the\nblack Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve surges an anxious crowd, in uncertainty and\nsuspense. At half past twelve torches are seen turning the corner of the\nRue de la Vannerie, escorting a delegate of the Convention, clad in the\ninsignia of office, who unfolds a paper and reads by the ruddy light the\ndecree of the Convention, the outlawry of the members of the insurgent\nCommune, of the members of the Council General who are its abettors and\nof all such citizens as shall listen to its appeal.\n\nOutlawry, death without trial! The mere thought pales the cheek of the\nmost determined. Gamelin feels the icy sweat on his brow. He watches the\ncrowd hurrying with all speed from the Place. Turning his head, he finds\nthat the Hall, packed but now with Councillors, is almost empty. But\nthey have fled in vain; their signatures attest their attendance.\n\nIt is two in the morning. The Incorruptible is in the neighbouring Hall,\nin deliberation with the Commune and the proscribed representatives.\n\nGamelin casts a despairing look over the dark Square below. By the light\nof the lanterns he can see the wooden candles above the grocer's shop\nknocking together like ninepins; the street lamps shiver and swing; a\nhigh wind has sprung up. Next moment a deluge of rain comes down; the\nPlace empties entirely; such as the fear of the Convention and its dread\ndecree had not put to flight scatter in terror of a wetting. Hanriot's\nguns are abandoned, and when the lightning reveals the troops of the\nConvention debouching simultaneously from the Rue Antoine and from the\nQuai, the approaches to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville are utterly deserted.\n\nAt last Maximilien has resolved to make appeal from the decree of the\nConvention to his own Section,--the _Section des Piques_.\n\nThe Council General sends for swords, pistols, muskets. But now the\nclash of arms, the trampling of feet and the shiver of broken glass fill\nthe building. The troops of the Convention sweep by like an avalanche\nacross the Hall of Deliberation, and pour into the Council Chamber. A\nshot rings out; Gamelin sees Robespierre fall; his jaw is broken. He\nhimself grasps his knife, the six-sous knife that, one day of bitter\nscarcity, had cut bread for a starving mother, the same knife that, one\nsummer evening at a farm at Orangis, \u00c3\u0089lodie had held in her lap, when\nshe cried the forfeits. He opens it, tries to plunge it into his heart,\nbut the blade strikes on a rib, closes on the handle, the catch giving\nway, and two fingers are badly cut. Gamelin falls, the blood pouring\nfrom the wounds. He lies quite still, but the cold is cruel, and he is\ntrampled underfoot in the turmoil of a fearful struggle. Through the\nhurly-burly he can distinctly hear the voice of the young dragoon Henry,\nshouting:\n\n\"The tyrant is no more; his myrmidons are broken. The Revolution will\nresume its course, majestic and terrible.\"\n\nGamelin fainted.\n\nAt seven in the morning a surgeon sent by the Convention dressed his\nhurts. The Convention was full of solicitude for Robespierre's\naccomplices; it would fain not have one of them escape the guillotine.\n\nThe artist, ex-juror, ex-member of the Council General of the Commune,\nwas borne on a litter to the Conciergerie.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\nOn the 10th, when \u00c3\u0089variste, after a fevered night passed on the\npallet-bed of a dungeon, awoke with a start of indescribable horror,\nParis was smiling in the sunshine in all her beauty and immensity;\nnew-born hope filled the prisoners' hearts; tradesmen were blithely\nopening their shops, citizens felt themselves richer, young men happier,\nwomen more beautiful, for the fall of Robespierre. Only a handful of\nJacobins, a few _Constitutional_ priests and a few old women trembled to\nsee the Government pass into the hands of the evil-minded and corrupt.\nDelegates from the Revolutionary Tribunal, the Public Prosecutor and two\njudges, were on their way to the Convention to congratulate it on having\nput an end to the plots. By decree of the Assembly the scaffold was\nagain to be set up in the Place de la R\u00c3\u00a9volution. They wanted the\nwealthy, the fashionable, the pretty women to see, without putting\nthemselves about, the execution of Robespierre, which was to take place\nthat same day. The Dictator and his accomplices were outlawed; it only\nneeded their identity to be verified by two municipal officers for the\nTribunal to hand them over immediately to the executioner. But a\ndifficulty arose; the verifications could not be made in legal form, the\nCommune as a body having been put outside the pale of law. The Assembly\nauthorized identification by ordinary witnesses.\n\nThe triumvirs were haled to death, with their chief accomplices, amidst\nshouts of joy and fury, imprecations, laughter and dances.\n\nThe next day \u00c3\u0089variste, who had recovered some strength and could almost\nstand on his legs, was taken from his cell, brought before the Tribunal,\nand placed on the platform where so many victims, illustrious or\nobscure, had sat in succession. Now it groaned under the weight of\nseventy individuals, the majority members of the Commune, some jurors,\nlike Gamelin, outlawed like him. Again he saw the jury-bench, the seat\nwhere he had been accustomed to loll, the place where he had terrorized\nunhappy prisoners, where he had affronted the scornful eyes of Jacques\nMaubel and Maurice Brotteaux, the appealing glances of the _citoyenne_\nRochemaure, who had got him his post as juryman and whom he had\nrecompensed with a sentence of death. Again he saw, looking down on the\nda\u00c3\u00afs where the judges sat in three mahogany armchairs, covered in red\nUtrecht velvet, the busts of Chalier and Marat and that bust of Brutus\nwhich he had one day apostrophized. Nothing was altered, neither the\naxes, the fasces, the red caps of Liberty on the wall-paper, nor the\ninsults shouted by the _tricoteuses_ in the galleries to those about to\ndie, nor yet the soul of Fouquier-Tinville, hard-headed, painstaking,\nzealously turning over his murderous papers, and, in his character of\nperfect magistrate, sending his friends of yesterday to the scaffold.\n\nThe _citoyens_ Remacle, tailor and door-keeper, and Dupont senior,\njoiner, of the Place de Thionville, member of the Committee of\nSurveillance of the Section du Pont-Neuf, identified Gamelin (\u00c3\u0089variste),\npainter, ex-juror of the Revolutionary Tribunal, ex-member of the\nCouncil General of the Commune. For their services they received an\nassignat of a hundred _sols_ from the funds of the Section; but, having\nbeen neighbours and friends of the outlaw, they found it embarrassing to\nmeet his eye. Anyhow, it was a hot day; they were thirsty and in a hurry\nto be off and drink a glass of wine.\n\nGamelin found difficulty in mounting the tumbril; he had lost a great\ndeal of blood and his wounds pained him cruelly. The driver whipped up\nhis jade and the procession got under way amid a storm of hooting.\n\nSome women recognized Gamelin and yelled:\n\n\"Go your ways, drinker of blood! murderer at eighteen francs a day!...\nHe doesn't laugh now; look how pale he is, the coward!\"\n\nThey were the same women who used in other days to insult conspirators\nand aristocrats, extremists and moderates, all the victims sent by\nGamelin and his colleagues to the guillotine.\n\nThe cart turned into the Quai des Morfondus, made slowly for the\nPont-Neuf and the Rue de la Monnaie; its destination was the Place de la\nR\u00c3\u00a9volution and Robespierre's scaffold. The horse was lame; every other\nminute the driver's whip whistled about its ears. The crowd of\nspectators, a merry, excited crowd, delayed the progress of the escort,\nfraternizing with the gendarmes, who pulled in their horses to a walk.\nAt the corner of the Rue Honor\u00c3\u00a9, the insults were redoubled. Parties of\nyoung men, at table in the fashionable restaurateurs' rooms on the\nmezzanine floor, ran to the windows, napkin in hand, and howled:\n\n\"Cannibals, man-eaters, vampires!\"\n\nThe cart having plunged into a heap of refuse that had not been removed\nduring the two days of civil disorder, the gilded youth screamed with\ndelight:\n\n\"The waggon's mired.... Hurrah! The Jacobins in the jakes!\"\n\nGamelin was thinking, and truth seemed to dawn on him.\n\n\"I die justly,\" he reflected. \"It is just we should receive these\noutrages cast at the Republic, for we should have safeguarded her\nagainst them. We have been weak; we have been guilty of supineness. We\nhave betrayed the Republic. We have earned our fate. Robespierre\nhimself, the immaculate, the saint, has sinned from mildness,\nmercifulness; his faults are wiped out by his martyrdom. He was my\nexemplar, and I, too, have betrayed the Republic; the Republic perishes;\nit is just and fair that I die with her. I have been over sparing of\nblood; let my blood flow! Let me perish! I have deserved ...\"\n\nSuch were his reflections when suddenly he caught sight of the signboard\nof the _Amour peintre_, and a torrent of bitter-sweet emotions swept\ntumultuously over his heart.\n\nThe shop was shut, the sun-blinds of the three windows on the mezzanine\nfloor were drawn right down. As the cart passed in front of the window\nof the blue chamber, a woman's hand, wearing a silver ring on the\nring-finger, pushed aside the edge of the blind and threw towards\nGamelin a red carnation which his bound hands prevented him from\ncatching, but which he adored as the token and likeness of those red and\nfragrant lips that had refreshed his mouth. His eyes filled with\nbursting tears, and his whole being was still entranced with the glamour\nof this farewell when he saw the blood-stained knife rise into view in\nthe Place de la R\u00c3\u00a9volution.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\n\nIt was Niv\u00c3\u00b4se. Masses of floating ice encumbered the Seine; the basins\nin the Tuileries garden, the kennels, the public fountains were frozen.\nThe North wind swept clouds of hoar frost before it in the streets. A\nwhite steam breathed from the horses' noses, and the city folk would\nglance in passing at the thermometer at the opticians' doors. A shop-boy\nwas wiping the fog from the window-panes of the _Amour peintre_, while\ncurious passers-by threw a look at the prints in vogue,--Robespierre\nsqueezing into a cup a heart like a pumpkin to drink the blood, and\nambitious allegorical designs with such titles as the Tigrocracy of\nRobespierre; it was all hydras, serpents, horrid monsters let loose on\nFrance by the tyrant. Other pictures represented the Horrible Conspiracy\nof Robespierre, Robespierre's Arrest, The Death of Robespierre.\n\nThat day, after the midday dinner, Philippe Desmahis walked into the\n_Amour peintre_, his portfolio under his arm, and brought the _citoyen_\nJean Blaise a plate he had just finished, a stippled engraving of the\nSuicide of Robespierre. The artist's picaresque burin had made\nRobespierre as hideous as possible. The French people were not yet\nsatiated with all the memorials which enshrined the horror and\nopprobrium felt for the man who was made scapegoat of all the crimes of\nthe Revolution. For all that, the printseller, who knew his public,\ninformed Desmahis that henceforward he was going to give him military\nsubjects to engrave.\n\n\"We shall all be wanting victories and conquests,--swords, waving\nplumes, triumphant generals. Glory is to be the word. I feel it in me;\nmy heart beats high to hear the exploits of our valiant armies. And when\nI have a feeling, it is seldom all the world doesn't have the same\nfeeling at the same time. What we want is warriors and women, Mars and\nVenus.\"\n\n\"_Citoyen_ Blaise, I have still two or three drawings of Gamelin's by\nme, which you gave me to engrave. Is it urgent?\"\n\n\"Not a bit.\"\n\n\"By-the-bye, about Gamelin; yesterday, strolling in the Boulevard du\nTemple, I saw at a dealer's, who keeps a second-hand stall opposite the\nHouse of Beaumarchais, all that poor devil's canvases, amongst the rest\nhis _Orestes and Electra_. The head of Orestes, who's like Gamelin, is\nreally fine, I assure you.... The head and arm are superb.... The man\ntold me he found no difficulty in getting rid of these canvases to\nartists who want to paint over them.... Poor Gamelin! He might have been\na genius of the first order, perhaps, if he hadn't taken to politics.\"\n\n\"He had the soul of a criminal!\" replied the _citoyen_ Blaise. \"I\nunmasked him, on this very spot, when his sanguinary instincts were\nstill held in check. He never forgave me.... Oh! he was a choice\nblackguard.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow! he was sincere enough. It was the fanatics were his\nruin.\"\n\n\"You don't defend him, I presume, Desmahis!... There's no defending\nhim.\"\n\n\"No, _citoyen_ Blaise, there's no defending him.\"\n\nThe _citoyen_ Blaise tapped the gallant Desmahis' shoulder amicably, and\nobserved:\n\n\"Times are changed. We can call you _Barbaroux_ now the Convention is\nrecalling the proscribed.... Now I think of it, Desmahis, engrave me a\nportrait of Charlotte Corday, will you?\"\n\nA woman, a tall, handsome brunette, enveloped in furs, entered the shop\nand bestowed on the _citoyen_ Blaise a little discreet nod that implied\nintimacy. It was Julie Gamelin; but she no longer bore that dishonoured\nname, she preferred to be called the _citoyenne_ widow Chassagne, and\nwore, under her mantle, a red tunic in honour of the red shirts of the\nterror. Julie had at first felt a certain repulsion towards \u00c3\u0089variste's\nmistress; anything that had come near her brother was odious to her. But\nthe _citoyenne_ Blaise, after \u00c3\u0089variste's death, had found an asylum for\nthe unhappy mother in the attics of the _Amour peintre_. Julie had also\ntaken refuge there; then she had got employment again at the fashionable\nmilliner's in the Rue des Lombards. Her short hair _\u00c3\u00a0 la victime_, her\naristocratic looks, her mourning weeds had won the sympathies of the\ngilded youth. Jean Blaise, whom Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin had pretty well thrown\nover, offered her his homage, which she accepted. Still Julie was fond\nof wearing men's clothes, as in the old tragic days; she had a fine\n_Muscadin_ costume made for her and often went, huge b\u00c3\u00a2ton and all\ncomplete, to sup at some tavern at S\u00c3\u00a8vres or Meudon with a girl friend,\na little assistant in a fashion shop. Inconsolable for the loss of the\nyoung noble whose name she bore, this masculine-minded Julie found the\nonly solace to her melancholy in a savage rancour; every time she\nencountered Jacobins, she would set the passers-by on them, crying\n\"Death, death!\" She had small leisure left to give to her mother, who\nalone in her room told her beads all day, too deeply shocked at her\nboy's tragic death to feel the grief that might have been expected. Rose\nwas now the constant companion of \u00c3\u0089lodie who certainly got on amicably\nwith her step-mothers.\n\n\"Where is \u00c3\u0089lodie?\" asked the _citoyenne_ Chassagne.\n\nJean Blaise shook his head; he did not know. He never did know; he made\nit a point of honour not to.\n\nJulie had come to take her friend with her to see Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin at\nMonceaux, where the actress lived in a little house with an English\ngarden.\n\nAt the Conciergerie Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin had made the acquaintance of a big\narmy-contractor, the _citoyen_ Montfort. She had been released first, by\nJean Blaise's intervention, and had then procured the _citoyen_\nMontfort's pardon, who was no sooner at liberty than he started his old\ntrade of provisioning the troops, to which he added speculation in\nbuilding-lots in the P\u00c3\u00a9pini\u00c3\u00a8re quarter. The architects Ledoux, Olivier\nand Wailly were erecting pretty houses in that district, and in three\nmonths the land had trebled in value. Montfort, since their imprisonment\ntogether in the Luxembourg, had been Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin's lover; he now gave\nher a little house in the neighbourhood of Tivoli and the Rue du Rocher,\nwhich was very expensive,--and cost him nothing, the sale of the\nadjacent properties having already repaid him several times over. Jean\nBlaise was a man of the world, so he deemed it best to put up with what\nhe could not hinder; he gave up Mademoiselle Th\u00c3\u00a9venin to Montfort\nwithout ceasing to be on friendly terms with her.\n\nJulie had not been long at the _Amour peintre_ before \u00c3\u0089lodie came down\nto her in the shop, looking like a fashion plate. Under her mantle,\ndespite the rigours of the season, she wore nothing but her white frock;\nher face was even paler than of old, and her figure thinner; her looks\nwere languishing, and her whole person breathed voluptuous invitation.\n\nThe two women set off for Rose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin's, who was expecting them.\nDesmahis accompanied them; the actress was consulting him about the\ndecoration of her new house and he was in love with \u00c3\u0089lodie, who had by\nthis time half made up her mind to let him sigh no more in vain. When\nthe party came near Monceaux, where the victims of the Place de la\nR\u00c3\u00a9volution lay buried under a layer of lime:\n\n\"It is all very well in the cold weather,\" remarked Julie; \"but in the\nspring the exhalations from the ground there will poison half the town.\"\n\nRose Th\u00c3\u00a9venin received her two friends in a drawing-room furnished _\u00c3\u00a0\nl'antique_, the sofas and armchairs of which were designed by David.\nRoman bas-reliefs, copied in monochrome, adorned the walls above\nstatues, busts and candelabra of imitation bronze. She wore a curled wig\nof a straw colour. At that date wigs were all the rage; it was quite\ncommon to include half a dozen, a dozen, a dozen and a half in a bride's\ntrousseau. A gown _\u00c3\u00a0 la Cyprienne_ moulded her body like a sheath.\nThrowing a cloak over her shoulders, she led her two friends and the\nengraver into the garden, which Ledoux was laying out for her, but which\nas yet was a chaos of leafless trees and plaster. She showed them,\nhowever, Fingal's grotto, a gothic chapel with a bell, a temple, a\ntorrent.\n\n\"There,\" she said, pointing to a clump of firs, \"I should like to raise\na cenotaph to the memory of the unfortunate Brotteaux des Ilettes. I was\nnot indifferent to him; he was a lovable man. The monsters slaughtered\nhim; I bewailed his fate. Desmahis, you shall design me an urn on a\ncolumn.\"\n\nThen she added almost without a pause:\n\n\"It is heart-breaking.... I wanted to give a ball this week; but all the\nfiddles are engaged three weeks in advance. There is dancing every night\nat the _citoyenne_ Tallien's.\"\n\nAfter dinner Mademoiselle Th\u00c3\u00a9venin's carriage took the three friends and\nDesmahis to the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Feydeau. All that was most elegant in Paris was\ngathered in the house--the women with hair dressed _\u00c3\u00a0 l'antique_ or _\u00c3\u00a0\nla victime_, in very low dresses, purple or white and spangled with\ngold, the men wearing very tall black collars and the chin disappearing\nin enormous white cravats.\n\nThe bill announced _Ph\u00c3\u00a8dre_ and the _Chien du Jardinier_,--The\nGardener's Dog. With one voice the audience demanded the hymn dear to\nthe _muscadins_ and the gilded youth, the _R\u00c3\u00a9veil du peuple_,--The\nAwakening of the People.\n\nThe curtain rose and a little man, short and fat, took the stage; it was\nthe celebrated Lays. He sang in his fine tenor voice:\n\n_Peuple fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, peuple de fr\u00c3\u00a8res!..._\n\nSuch storms of applause broke out as set the lustres of the chandelier\njingling. Then some murmurs made themselves heard, and the voice of a\ncitizen in a round hat answered from the pit with the hymn of the\nMarseillaise:\n\n_Allons, enfants de la patrie...._\n\nThe voice was drowned by howls, and shouts were raised:\n\n\"Down with the Terrorists! Death to the Jacobins!\"\n\nLays was recalled and sang a second time over the hymn of the\nThermidorians.\n\n_Peuple fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, peuple de fr\u00c3\u00a8res!..._\n\nIn every play-house was to be seen the bust of Marat, surmounting a\ncolumn or raised on a pedestal; at the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Feydeau this bust stood\non a dwarf pillar on the \"prompt\" side, against the masonry-framing in\nthe stage.\n\nWhile the orchestra was playing the Overture of _Ph\u00c3\u00a8dre et Hippolyte_, a\nyoung _Muscadin_, pointing his cane at the bust, shouted:\n\n\"Down with Marat!\"--and the whole house took up the cry: \"Down with\nMarat! Down with Marat!\"\n\nUrgent voices rose above the uproar:\n\n\"It is a black shame that bust should still be there!\"\n\n\"The infamous Marat lords it everywhere, to our dishonour! His busts are\nas many as the heads he wanted to cut off.\"\n\n\"Venomous toad!\"\n\n\"Tiger!\"\n\n\"Vile serpent!\"\n\nSuddenly an elegantly dressed spectator clambers on to the edge of his\nbox, pushes the bust, oversets it. The plaster head falls in shivers on\nthe musicians' heads amid the cheers of the audience, who spring to\ntheir feet and strike up the _R\u00c3\u00a9veil du Peuple_:\n\n_Peuple fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, peuple de fr\u00c3\u00a8res!..._\n\nAmong the most enthusiastic singers \u00c3\u0089lodie recognized the handsome\ndragoon, the little lawyer's clerk, Henry, her first love.\n\nAfter the performance the gallant Desmahis called a cabriolet and\nescorted the _citoyenne_ Blaise back to the _Amour peintre_.\n\nIn the carriage the artist took \u00c3\u0089lodie's hand between his:\n\n\"You know, \u00c3\u0089lodie, I love you?\"\n\n\"I know it, because you love all women.\"\n\n\"I love them in you.\"\n\nShe smiled:\n\n\"I should be assuming a heavy task, spite of the wigs black, blonde and\nred, that are the rage, if I undertook to be all women, all sorts of\nwomen, for you.\"\n\n\"\u00c3\u0089lodie, I swear....\"\n\n\"What! oaths, _citoyen_ Desmahis? Either you have a deal of simplicity,\nor you credit me with overmuch.\"\n\nDesmahis had not a word to say, and she hugged herself over the triumph\nof having reduced her witty admirer to silence.\n\nAt the corner of the Rue de la Loi they heard singing and shouting and\nsaw shadows flitting round a brazier of live coals. It was a band of\nyoung bloods who had just come out of the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais and were\nburning a guy representing the Friend of the People.\n\nIn the Rue Honor\u00c3\u00a9 the coachman struck his cocked hat against a burlesque\neffigy of Marat swinging from the cord of a street lantern.\n\nThe fellow, heartened by the incident, turned round to his fares and\ntold them how, only last night, the tripe-seller in the Rue Montorgueil\nhad smeared blood over Marat's head, declaring: \"That's the stuff he\nliked,\" and how some little scamps of ten had thrown the bust into the\nsewer, and how the spectators had hit the nail on the head, shouting:\n\n\"That's the Panth\u00c3\u00a9on for him!\"\n\nMeanwhile, from every eating-house and restaurateur's voices could be\nheard singing:\n\n_Peuple fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, peuple de fr\u00c3\u00a8res!..._\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said \u00c3\u0089lodie, jumping out of the cabriolet.\n\nBut Desmahis begged so hard, he was so tenderly urgent and spoke so\nsweetly, that she had not the heart to leave him at the door.\n\n\"It is late,\" she said; \"you must only stay an instant.\"\n\nIn the blue chamber she threw off her mantle and appeared in her white\ngown _\u00c3\u00a0 l'antique_, which displayed all the warm fulness of her shape.\n\n\"You are cold, perhaps,\" she said, \"I will light the fire; it is already\nlaid.\"\n\nShe struck the flint and put a lighted match to the fire.\n\nPhilippe took her in his arms with the gentleness that bespeaks\nstrength, and she felt a strange, delicious thrill. She was already\nyielding beneath his kisses when she snatched herself from his arms,\ncrying:\n\n\"Let me be.\"\n\nSlowly she uncoiled her hair before the chimney-glass; then she looked\nmournfully at the ring she wore on the ring-finger of her left hand, a\nlittle silver ring on which the face of Marat, all worn and battered,\ncould no longer be made out. She looked at it till the tears confused\nher sight, took it off softly and tossed it into the flames.\n\nThen, her face shining with tears and smiles, transfigured with\ntenderness and passion, she threw herself into Philippe's arms.\n\nThe night was far advanced when the _citoyenne_ Blaise opened the outer\ndoor of the flat for her lover and whispered to him in the darkness:\n\n\"Good-bye, sweetheart! It is the hour my father will be coming home. If\nyou hear a noise on the stairs, go up quick to the higher floor and\ndon't come down till all danger is over of your being seen. To have the\nstreet-door opened, give three raps on the _concierge's_ window.\nGood-bye, my life, good-bye, my soul!\"\n\nThe last dying embers were glowing on the hearth when \u00c3\u0089lodie, tired and\nhappy, dropped her head on the pillow.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gods are Athirst, by Anatole France\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GODS ARE ATHIRST ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24010-8.txt or 24010-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/4\/0\/1\/24010\/\n\nProduced by R.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1357,"split":"test"}
