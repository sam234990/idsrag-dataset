She is selected to go to a ball to repair torn dresses. At the ball she meets the aristocratic Henry Bellingham, a rake figure who is instantly attracted to her. They meet again by chance and form a secret friendship; on an outing together they are spotted by Mrs Mason who, fearing for her shop's reputation, dismisses Ruth.\nAlone in the world, Ruth is whisked away by Bellingham to London where it is implied she becomes a fallen woman. They go on holiday to Wales together and there on a country walk Ruth meets the disabled and kind Mr Benson. Bellingham falls sick with fever and the hotel calls for his mother who arrives and is disgusted by her son's having lived in sin with Ruth. Bellingham is persuaded by his mother to abandon Ruth in Wales, leaving her some money.\nA distraught Ruth attempts suicide but is spotted by Mr Benson who helps comfort her. When he learns of her past and that she is alone he brings her back to his home town, where he is a Dissenting minister, to stay with him and his formidable but kind sister Faith. When they learn that Ruth is pregnant they decide to lie to the town and claim that she is a widow called Mrs Denbigh, to protect her from a society which would otherwise shun her.\nRuth has her baby, whom she names Leonard. She is transformed into a Madonna type figure, calm and innocent once more. The rich local businessman Mr Bradshaw admires Ruth and employs her as a governess for his children, including his eldest daughter Jemima who is in awe of the beautiful Ruth.\nRuth goes away with the Bradshaws to a seaside house while one of Mr Bradshaw's children is convalescing from a long illness. Mr Bradshaw brings Mr Donne, a man whom he is sponsoring to become their local MP, to the seaside to impress him. Ruth recognises Mr Donne as actually being Mr Bellingham and the two have a confrontation on the beach. Bellingham offers to marry Ruth as he claims he still loves her and for the sake of their child, Ruth rejects him saying she will not let Leonard come in contact with a man like him.\nFrom local gossip Jemima discovers about Ruth's past, though she is still unaware that it was Mr Donne who is Leonard's father. Jemima is headstrong and already jealous that her suitor Mr Farquhar, her father's business partner, seems to admire Ruth over her. The truth is Mr Farquhar is put off by Jemima's erratic behaviour, caused by her father's good intentioned interference. Jemima however decides to keep quiet over Ruth's past as she realises that she comes from a more privileged background and the same could well have happened to her, had she been in Ruth's situation.\nMr Bradshaw discovers also from local gossip however that Ruth is a fallen woman and despite Jemima's passionate defence of Ruth she is thrown out of the house and sacked. Ruth goes home and has to reveal to Leonard that he is in fact illegitimate; he is devastated and ashamed by the news. Mr Bradshaw also goes to his old friend Mr Benson and argues with him as he allowed the lie to be told and for Ruth to enter not only his but also Mr Bradshaw's house.\nJemima and Mr Farquhar marry and have their own child and form a good friendship with Ruth and Leonard but they are still on the outskirts of society. Ruth goes among the poor to work as a nurse to the sick and gains a good reputation there, making Leonard proud of his mother once more and restoring their relationship. Mr Bradshaw's son is found to have been embezzling the company's funds and his father disowns him. However, when his son is later involved in an accident, Mr Bradshaw is distraught and realises that his morals had been perhaps too heavy-handed in the past. His son recovers and Mr Bradshaw starts to rethink his life.\nRuth has to give up her work as there is a catching fever in the environment. A local doctor offers to sponsor Leonard's studies at a good school and the Farquhars offer to go away on holiday with Ruth and Leonard. However before Ruth has made a decision she hears that Mr Donne is very sick; she confides in the doctor the truth about who Mr Donne really is, and goes to him. He is delirious with fever and does not recognise her but she nurses him back to health.\nRuth however falls sick and dies from the illness. At the funeral many of the poor that Ruth had looked after praise her, and the chapel is full of people that loved Ruth, despite her being a fallen woman. Mr Donne comes to Mr Benson's house and sees Ruth dead, he is momentarily sad and offers money to Mr Benson who realises who he must be and throws him out of the house.\nThe novel ends with Mr Bradshaw finding a weeping Leonard at his mother's grave, whom he leads home to Mr Benson, and reforming his friendship with Mr Benson realising that as a member of the society that ostracised Ruth, he is also responsible for her death.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Ruth, by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The sides\nof the streets had a quaint richness, from the effect of the gables,\nand the stacks of chimneys which cut against the blue sky above;\nwhile, if the eye fell lower down, the attention was arrested by all\nkinds of projections in the shape of balcony and oriel; and it was\namusing to see the infinite variety of windows that had been crammed\ninto the walls long before Mr Pitt's days of taxation. The streets\nbelow suffered from all these projections and advanced stories above;\nthey were dark, and ill-paved with large, round, jolting pebbles, and\nwith no side-path protected by kerb-stones; there were no lamp-posts\nfor long winter nights; and no regard was paid to the wants of the\nmiddle class, who neither drove about in coaches of their own, nor\nwere carried by their own men in their own sedans into the very\nhalls of their friends. The professional men and their wives, the\nshopkeepers and their spouses, and all such people, walked about at\nconsiderable peril both night and day. The broad unwieldy carriages\nhemmed them up against the houses in the narrow streets. The\ninhospitable houses projected their flights of steps almost into the\ncarriage-way, forcing pedestrians again into the danger they had\navoided for twenty or thirty paces. Then, at night, the only light\nwas derived from the glaring, flaring oil-lamps hung above the doors\nof the more aristocratic mansions; just allowing space for the\npassers-by to become visible, before they again disappeared into the\ndarkness, where it was no uncommon thing for robbers to be in waiting\nfor their prey.\n\nThe traditions of those bygone times, even to the smallest social\nparticular, enable one to understand more clearly the circumstances\nwhich contributed to the formation of character. The daily life\ninto which people are born, and into which they are absorbed before\nthey are well aware, forms chains which only one in a hundred has\nmoral strength enough to despise, and to break when the right time\ncomes--when an inward necessity for independent individual action\narises, which is superior to all outward conventionalities. Therefore\nit is well to know what were the chains of daily domestic habit which\nwere the natural leading-strings of our forefathers before they\nlearnt to go alone.\n\nThe picturesqueness of those ancient streets has departed now.\nThe Astleys, the Dunstans, the Waverhams--names of power in that\ndistrict--go up duly to London in the season, and have sold their\nresidences in the county-town fifty years ago, or more. And when the\ncounty-town lost its attraction for the Astleys, the Dunstans, the\nWaverhams, how could it be supposed that the Domvilles, the Bextons,\nand the Wildes would continue to go and winter there in their\nsecond-rate houses, and with their increased expenditure? So the\ngrand old houses stood empty awhile; and then speculators ventured\nto purchase, and to turn the deserted mansions into many smaller\ndwellings, fitted for professional men, or even (bend your ear lower,\nlest the shade of Marmaduke, first Baron Waverham, hear) into shops!\n\nEven that was not so very bad, compared with the next innovation on\nthe old glories. The shopkeepers found out that the once fashionable\nstreet was dark, and that the dingy light did not show off their\ngoods to advantage; the surgeon could not see to draw his patient's\nteeth; the lawyer had to ring for candles an hour earlier than he was\naccustomed to do when living in a more plebeian street. In short, by\nmutual consent, the whole front of one side of the street was pulled\ndown, and rebuilt in the flat, mean, unrelieved style of George the\nThird. The body of the houses was too solidly grand to submit to\nalteration; so people were occasionally surprised, after passing\nthrough a commonplace-looking shop, to find themselves at the foot of\na grand carved oaken staircase, lighted by a window of stained glass,\nstoried all over with armorial bearings.\n\nUp such a stair--past such a window (through which the moonlight fell\non her with a glory of many colours)--Ruth Hilton passed wearily one\nJanuary night, now many years ago. I call it night; but, strictly\nspeaking, it was morning. Two o'clock in the morning chimed forth\nthe old bells of St Saviour's. And yet more than a dozen girls still\nsat in the room into which Ruth entered, stitching away as if for\nvery life, not daring to gape, or show any outward manifestation of\nsleepiness. They only sighed a little when Ruth told Mrs Mason the\nhour of the night, as the result of her errand; for they knew that,\nstay up as late as they might, the work-hours of the next day must\nbegin at eight, and their young limbs were very weary.\n\nMrs Mason worked away as hard as any of them; but she was older and\ntougher; and, besides, the gains were hers. But even she perceived\nthat some rest was needed. \"Young ladies! there will be an interval\nallowed of half an hour. Ring the bell, Miss Sutton. Martha shall\nbring you up some bread and cheese and beer. You will be so good as\nto eat it standing--away from the dresses--and to have your hands\nwashed ready for work when I return. In half an hour,\" said she once\nmore, very distinctly; and then she left the room.\n\nIt was curious to watch the young girls as they instantaneously\navailed themselves of Mrs Mason's absence. One fat, particularly\nheavy-looking damsel laid her head on her folded arms and was asleep\nin a moment; refusing to be wakened for her share in the frugal\nsupper, but springing up with a frightened look at the sound of\nMrs Mason's returning footstep, even while it was still far off on\nthe echoing stairs. Two or three others huddled over the scanty\nfireplace, which, with every possible economy of space, and no\nattempt whatever at anything of grace or ornament, was inserted in\nthe slight, flat-looking wall, that had been run up by the present\nowner of the property to portion off this division of the grand old\ndrawing-room of the mansion. Some employed the time in eating their\nbread and cheese, with as measured and incessant a motion of the jaws\n(and almost as stupidly placid an expression of countenance), as you\nmay see in cows ruminating in the first meadow you happen to pass.\n\nSome held up admiringly the beautiful ball-dress in progress, while\nothers examined the effect, backing from the object to be criticised\nin the true artistic manner. Others stretched themselves into all\nsorts of postures to relieve the weary muscles; one or two gave vent\nto all the yawns, coughs, and sneezes that had been pent up so long\nin the presence of Mrs Mason. But Ruth Hilton sprang to the large old\nwindow, and pressed against it as a bird presses against the bars of\nits cage. She put back the blind, and gazed into the quiet moonlight\nnight. It was doubly light--almost as much so as day--for everything\nwas covered with the deep snow which had been falling silently ever\nsince the evening before. The window was in a square recess; the old\nstrange little panes of glass had been replaced by those which gave\nmore light. A little distance off, the feathery branches of a larch\nwaved softly to and fro in the scarcely perceptible night-breeze.\nPoor old larch! the time had been when it had stood in a pleasant\nlawn, with the tender grass creeping caressingly up to its very\ntrunk; but now the lawn was divided into yards and squalid\nback premises, and the larch was pent up and girded about with\nflag-stones. The snow lay thick on its boughs, and now and then fell\nnoiselessly down. The old stables had been added to, and altered into\na dismal street of mean-looking houses, back to back with the ancient\nmansions. And over all these changes from grandeur to squalor, bent\ndown the purple heavens with their unchanging splendour!\n\nRuth pressed her hot forehead against the cold glass, and strained\nher aching eyes in gazing out on the lovely sky of a winter's night.\nThe impulse was strong upon her to snatch up a shawl, and wrapping it\nround her head, to sally forth and enjoy the glory; and time was when\nthat impulse would have been instantly followed; but now, Ruth's eyes\nfilled with tears, and she stood quite still, dreaming of the days\nthat were gone. Some one touched her shoulder while her thoughts were\nfar away, remembering past January nights, which had resembled this,\nand were yet so different.\n\n\"Ruth, love,\" whispered a girl who had unwillingly distinguished\nherself by a long hard fit of coughing, \"come and have some supper.\nYou don't know yet how it helps one through the night.\"\n\n\"One run--one blow of the fresh air would do me more good,\" said\nRuth.\n\n\"Not such a night as this,\" replied the other, shivering at the very\nthought.\n\n\"And why not such a night as this, Jenny?\" answered Ruth. \"Oh! at\nhome I have many a time run up the lane all the way to the mill, just\nto see the icicles hang on the great wheel; and when I was once out,\nI could hardly find in my heart to come in, even to mother, sitting\nby the fire;--even to mother,\" she added, in a low, melancholy tone,\nwhich had something of inexpressible sadness in it. \"Why, Jenny!\"\nsaid she, rousing herself, but not before her eyes were swimming\nwith tears, \"own, now, that you never saw those dismal, hateful,\ntumble-down old houses there look half so--what shall I call them?\nalmost beautiful--as they do now, with that soft, pure, exquisite\ncovering; and if they are so improved, think of what trees, and\ngrass, and ivy must be on such a night as this.\"\n\nJenny could not be persuaded into admiring the winter's night, which\nto her came only as a cold and dismal time, when her cough was more\ntroublesome, and the pain in her side worse than usual. But she put\nher arm round Ruth's neck, and stood by her, glad that the orphan\napprentice, who was not yet inured to the hardship of a dressmaker's\nworkroom, should find so much to give her pleasure in such a common\noccurrence as a frosty night.\n\nThey remained deep in separate trains of thought till Mrs Mason's\nstep was heard, when each returned, supperless but refreshed, to her\nseat.\n\nRuth's place was the coldest and the darkest in the room, although\nshe liked it the best; she had instinctively chosen it for the sake\nof the wall opposite to her, on which was a remnant of the beauty\nof the old drawing-room, which must once have been magnificent, to\njudge from the faded specimen left. It was divided into panels of\npale sea-green, picked out with white and gold; and on these panels\nwere painted--were thrown with the careless, triumphant hand of a\nmaster--the most lovely wreaths of flowers, profuse and luxuriant\nbeyond description, and so real-looking, that you could almost\nfancy you smelt their fragrance, and heard the south wind go softly\nrustling in and out among the crimson roses--the branches of purple\nand white lilac--the floating golden-tressed laburnum boughs.\nBesides these, there were stately white lilies, sacred to the\nVirgin--hollyhocks, fraxinella, monk's-hood, pansies, primroses;\nevery flower which blooms profusely in charming old-fashioned country\ngardens was there, depicted among its graceful foliage, but not in\nthe wild disorder in which I have enumerated them. At the bottom of\nthe panel lay a holly-branch, whose stiff straightness was ornamented\nby a twining drapery of English ivy and mistletoe and winter aconite;\nwhile down either side hung pendant garlands of spring and autumn\nflowers; and, crowning all, came gorgeous summer with the sweet\nmusk-roses, and the rich-coloured flowers of June and July.\n\nSurely Monnoyer, or whoever the dead and gone artist might be, would\nhave been gratified to know the pleasure his handiwork, even in its\nwane, had power to give to the heavy heart of a young girl; for they\nconjured up visions of other sister-flowers that grew, and blossomed,\nand withered away in her early home.\n\nMrs Mason was particularly desirous that her workwomen should exert\nthemselves to-night, for, on the next, the annual hunt-ball was to\ntake place. It was the one gaiety of the town since the assize-balls\nhad been discontinued. Many were the dresses she had promised should\nbe sent home \"without fail\" the next morning; she had not let one\nslip through her fingers, for fear, if it did, it might fall into the\nhands of the rival dressmaker, who had just established herself in\nthe very same street.\n\nShe determined to administer a gentle stimulant to the flagging\nspirits, and with a little preliminary cough to attract attention,\nshe began:\n\n\"I may as well inform you, young ladies, that I have been requested\nthis year, as on previous occasions, to allow some of my young people\nto attend in the ante-chamber of the assembly-room with sandal\nribbon, pins, and such little matters, and to be ready to repair any\naccidental injury to the ladies' dresses. I shall send four--of the\nmost diligent.\" She laid a marked emphasis on the last words, but\nwithout much effect; they were too sleepy to care for any of the\npomps and vanities, or, indeed, for any of the comforts of this\nworld, excepting one sole thing--their beds.\n\nMrs Mason was a very worthy woman, but, like many other worthy women,\nshe had her foibles; and one (very natural to her calling) was to\npay an extreme regard to appearances. Accordingly, she had already\nselected in her own mind the four girls who were most likely to do\ncredit to the \"establishment;\" and these were secretly determined\nupon, although it was very well to promise the reward to the most\ndiligent. She was really not aware of the falseness of this conduct;\nbeing an adept in that species of sophistry with which people\npersuade themselves that what they wish to do is right.\n\nAt last there was no resisting the evidence of weariness. They were\ntold to go to bed; but even that welcome command was languidly\nobeyed. Slowly they folded up their work, heavily they moved about,\nuntil at length all was put away, and they trooped up the wide, dark\nstaircase.\n\n\"Oh! how shall I get through five years of these terrible nights! in\nthat close room! and in that oppressive stillness! which lets every\nsound of the thread be heard as it goes eternally backwards and\nforwards,\" sobbed out Ruth, as she threw herself on her bed, without\neven undressing herself.\n\n\"Nay, Ruth, you know it won't be always as it has been to-night. We\noften get to bed by ten o'clock; and by-and-by you won't mind the\ncloseness of the room. You're worn out to-night, or you would not\nhave minded the sound of the needle; I never hear it. Come, let me\nunfasten you,\" said Jenny.\n\n\"What is the use of undressing? We must be up again and at work in\nthree hours.\"\n\n\"And in those three hours you may get a great deal of rest, if you\nwill but undress yourself and fairly go to bed. Come, love.\"\n\nJenny's advice was not resisted; but before Ruth went to sleep, she\nsaid:\n\n\"Oh! I wish I was not so cross and impatient. I don't think I used to\nbe.\"\n\n\"No, I am sure not. Most new girls get impatient at first; but it\ngoes off, and they don't care much for anything after awhile. Poor\nchild! she's asleep already,\" said Jenny to herself.\n\nShe could not sleep or rest. The tightness at her side was worse than\nusual. She almost thought she ought to mention it in her letters\nhome; but then she remembered the premium her father had struggled\nhard to pay, and the large family, younger than herself, that had to\nbe cared for, and she determined to bear on, and trust that when the\nwarm weather came both the pain and the cough would go away. She\nwould be prudent about herself.\n\nWhat was the matter with Ruth? She was crying in her sleep as if her\nheart would break. Such agitated slumber could be no rest; so Jenny\nwakened her.\n\n\"Ruth! Ruth!\"\n\n\"Oh, Jenny!\" said Ruth, sitting up in bed, and pushing back the\nmasses of hair that were heating her forehead, \"I thought I saw mamma\nby the side of the bed, coming, as she used to do, to see if I were\nasleep and comfortable; and when I tried to take hold of her, she\nwent away and left me alone--I don't know where; so strange!\"\n\n\"It was only a dream; you know you'd been talking about her to me,\nand you're feverish with sitting up late. Go to sleep again, and I'll\nwatch, and waken you if you seem uneasy.\"\n\n\"But you'll be so tired. Oh, dear! dear!\" Ruth was asleep again, even\nwhile she sighed.\n\nMorning came, and though their rest had been short, the girls arose\nrefreshed.\n\n\"Miss Sutton, Miss Jennings, Miss Booth, and Miss Hilton, you will\nsee that you are ready to accompany me to the shire-hall by eight\no'clock.\"\n\nOne or two of the girls looked astonished, but the majority,\nhaving anticipated the selection, and knowing from experience the\nunexpressed rule by which it was made, received it with the sullen\nindifference which had become their feeling with regard to most\nevents--a deadened sense of life, consequent upon their unnatural\nmode of existence, their sedentary days, and their frequent nights of\nlate watching.\n\nBut to Ruth it was inexplicable. She had yawned, and loitered, and\nlooked off at the beautiful panel, and lost herself in thoughts of\nhome, until she fully expected the reprimand which at any other time\nshe would have been sure to receive, and now, to her surprise, she\nwas singled out as one of the most diligent!\n\nMuch as she longed for the delight of seeing the noble\nshire-hall--the boast of the county--and of catching glimpses of the\ndancers, and hearing the band; much as she longed for some variety to\nthe dull, monotonous life she was leading, she could not feel happy\nto accept a privilege, granted, as she believed, in ignorance of the\nreal state of the case; so she startled her companions by rising\nabruptly and going up to Mrs Mason, who was finishing a dress which\nought to have been sent home two hours before:\n\n\"If you please, Mrs Mason, I was not one of the most diligent; I am\nafraid--I believe--I was not diligent at all. I was very tired; and\nI could not help thinking, and when I think, I can't attend to my\nwork.\" She stopped, believing she had sufficiently explained her\nmeaning; but Mrs Mason would not understand, and did not wish for any\nfurther elucidation.\n\n\"Well, my dear, you must learn to think and work too; or, if you\ncan't do both, you must leave off thinking. Your guardian, you know,\nexpects you to make great progress in your business, and I am sure\nyou won't disappoint him.\"\n\nBut that was not to the point. Ruth stood still an instant, although\nMrs Mason resumed her employment in a manner which any one but a \"new\ngirl\" would have known to be intelligible enough, that she did not\nwish for any more conversation just then.\n\n\"But as I was not diligent I ought not to go, ma'am. Miss Wood was\nfar more industrious than I, and many of the others.\"\n\n\"Tiresome girl!\" muttered Mrs Mason; \"I've half a mind to keep her\nat home for plaguing me so.\" But, looking up, she was struck afresh\nwith the remarkable beauty which Ruth possessed; such a credit to the\nhouse, with her waving outline of figure, her striking face, with\ndark eyebrows and dark lashes, combined with auburn hair and a fair\ncomplexion. No! diligent or idle, Ruth Hilton must appear to-night.\n\n\"Miss Hilton,\" said Mrs Mason, with stiff dignity, \"I am not\naccustomed (as these young ladies can tell you) to have my decisions\nquestioned. What I say, I mean; and I have my reasons. So sit down,\nif you please, and take care and be ready by eight. Not a word more,\"\nas she fancied she saw Ruth again about to speak.\n\n\"Jenny! you ought to have gone, not me,\" said Ruth, in no low voice\nto Miss Wood, as she sat down by her.\n\n\"Hush! Ruth. I could not go if I might, because of my cough. I would\nrather give it up to you than any one, if it were mine to give. And\nsuppose it is, and take the pleasure as my present, and tell me every\nbit about it when you come home to-night.\"\n\n\"Well! I shall take it in that way, and not as if I'd earned it,\nwhich I haven't. So thank you. You can't think how I shall enjoy it\nnow. I did work diligently for five minutes last night, after I heard\nof it, I wanted to go so much. But I could not keep it up. Oh, dear!\nand I shall really hear a band! and see the inside of that beautiful\nshire-hall!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nRuth Goes to the Shire-Hall\n\n\nIn due time that evening, Mrs Mason collected \"her young ladies\"\nfor an inspection of their appearance before proceeding to the\nshire-hall. Her eager, important, hurried manner of summoning them\nwas not unlike that of a hen clucking her chickens together; and to\njudge from the close investigation they had to undergo, it might have\nbeen thought that their part in the evening's performance was to be\nfar more important than that of temporary ladies'-maids.\n\n\"Is that your best frock, Miss Hilton?\" asked Mrs Mason, in a\nhalf-dissatisfied tone, turning Ruth about; for it was only her\nSunday black silk, and was somewhat worn and shabby.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" answered Ruth, quietly.\n\n\"Oh! indeed. Then it will do\" (still the half-satisfied tone).\n\"Dress, young ladies, you know, is a very secondary consideration.\nConduct is everything. Still, Miss Hilton, I think you should write\nand ask your guardian to send you money for another gown. I am sorry\nI did not think of it before.\"\n\n\"I do not think he would send any if I wrote,\" answered Ruth, in a\nlow voice. \"He was angry when I wanted a shawl, when the cold weather\nset in.\"\n\nMrs Mason gave her a little push of dismissal, and Ruth fell into the\nranks by her friend, Miss Wood.\n\n\"Never mind, Ruthie; you're prettier than any of them,\" said a merry,\ngood-natured girl, whose plainness excluded her from any of the envy\nof rivalry.\n\n\"Yes! I know I am pretty,\" said Ruth, sadly, \"but I am sorry I have\nno better gown, for this is very shabby. I am ashamed of it myself,\nand I can see Mrs Mason is twice as much ashamed. I wish I need not\ngo. I did not know we should have to think about our own dress at\nall, or I should not have wished to go.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Ruth,\" said Jenny, \"you've been looked at now, and Mrs\nMason will soon be too busy to think about you and your gown.\"\n\n\"Did you hear Ruth Hilton say she knew she was pretty?\" whispered one\ngirl to another, so loudly that Ruth caught the words.\n\n\"I could not help knowing,\" answered she, simply, \"for many people\nhave told me so.\"\n\nAt length these preliminaries were over, and they were walking\nbriskly through the frosty air; the free motion was so inspiriting\nthat Ruth almost danced along, and quite forgot all about shabby\ngowns and grumbling guardians. The shire-hall was even more striking\nthan she had expected. The sides of the staircase were painted with\nfigures that showed ghostly in the dim light, for only their faces\nlooked out of the dark, dingy canvas, with a strange fixed stare of\nexpression.\n\nThe young milliners had to arrange their wares on tables in the\nante-room, and make all ready before they could venture to peep\ninto the ball-room, where the musicians were already tuning their\ninstruments, and where one or two char-women (strange contrast! with\ntheir dirty, loose attire, and their incessant chatter, to the grand\nechoes of the vaulted room) were completing the dusting of benches\nand chairs.\n\nThey quitted the place as Ruth and her companions entered. They had\ntalked lightly and merrily in the ante-room, but now their voices\nwere hushed, awed by the old magnificence of the vast apartment. It\nwas so large, that objects showed dim at the further end, as through\na mist. Full-length figures of county worthies hung around, in all\nvarieties of costume, from the days of Holbein to the present time.\nThe lofty roof was indistinct, for the lamps were not fully lighted\nyet; while through the richly-painted Gothic window at one end the\nmoonbeams fell, many-tinted, on the floor, and mocked with their\nvividness the struggles of the artificial light to illuminate its\nlittle sphere.\n\nHigh above sounded the musicians, fitfully trying some strain of\nwhich they were not certain. Then they stopped playing and talked,\nand their voices sounded goblin-like in their dark recess, where\ncandles were carried about in an uncertain wavering manner, reminding\nRuth of the flickering zigzag motion of the will-o'-the-wisp.\n\nSuddenly the room sprang into the full blaze of light, and Ruth felt\nless impressed with its appearance, and more willing to obey Mrs\nMason's sharp summons to her wandering flock, than she had been\nwhen it was dim and mysterious. They had presently enough to do in\nrendering offices of assistance to the ladies who thronged in, and\nwhose voices drowned all the muffled sound of the band Ruth had\nlonged so much to hear. Still, if one pleasure was less, another was\ngreater than she had anticipated.\n\n\"On condition\" of such a number of little observances that Ruth\nthought Mrs Mason would never have ended enumerating them, they were\nallowed during the dances to stand at a side-door and watch. And what\na beautiful sight it was! Floating away to that bounding music--now\nfar away, like garlands of fairies, now near, and showing as lovely\nwomen, with every ornament of graceful dress--the elite of the county\ndanced on, little caring whose eyes gazed and were dazzled. Outside\nall was cold, and colourless, and uniform, one coating of snow over\nall. But inside it was warm, and glowing, and vivid; flowers scented\nthe air, and wreathed the head, and rested on the bosom, as if it\nwere midsummer. Bright colours flashed on the eye and were gone, and\nsucceeded by others as lovely in the rapid movement of the dance.\nSmiles dimpled every face, and low tones of happiness murmured\nindistinctly through the room in every pause of the music.\n\nRuth did not care to separate the figures that formed a joyous and\nbrilliant whole; it was enough to gaze, and dream of the happy\nsmoothness of the lives in which such music, and such profusion of\nflowers, of jewels, elegance of every description, and beauty of all\nshapes and hues, were everyday things. She did not want to know who\nthe people were; although to hear a catalogue of names seemed to be\nthe great delight of most of her companions.\n\nIn fact, the enumeration rather disturbed her; and to avoid the shock\nof too rapid a descent into the commonplace world of Miss Smiths and\nMr Thomsons, she returned to her post in the ante-room. There she\nstood thinking, or dreaming. She was startled back to actual life by\na voice close to her. One of the dancing young ladies had met with a\nmisfortune. Her dress, of some gossamer material, had been looped up\nby nosegays of flowers, and one of these had fallen off in the dance,\nleaving her gown to trail. To repair this, she had begged her partner\nto bring her to the room where the assistants should have been. None\nwere there but Ruth.\n\n\"Shall I leave you?\" asked the gentleman. \"Is my absence necessary?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" replied the lady. \"A few stitches will set all to rights.\nBesides, I dare not enter that room by myself.\" So far she spoke\nsweetly and prettily. But now she addressed Ruth. \"Make haste. Don't\nkeep me an hour.\" And her voice became cold and authoritative.\n\nShe was very pretty, with long dark ringlets and sparkling black\neyes. These had struck Ruth in the hasty glance she had taken, before\nshe knelt down to her task. She also saw that the gentleman was young\nand elegant.\n\n\"Oh, that lovely galop! How I long to dance to it! Will it never be\ndone? What a frightful time you are taking; and I'm dying to return\nin time for this galop!\"\n\nBy way of showing a pretty, childlike impatience, she began to beat\ntime with her feet to the spirited air the band was playing. Ruth\ncould not darn the rent in her dress with this continual motion, and\nshe looked up to remonstrate. As she threw her head back for this\npurpose, she caught the eye of the gentleman who was standing by; it\nwas so expressive of amusement at the airs and graces of his pretty\npartner, that Ruth was infected by the feeling, and had to bend her\nface down to conceal the smile that mantled there. But not before\nhe had seen it, and not before his attention had been thereby drawn\nto consider the kneeling figure, that, habited in black up to the\nthroat, with the noble head bent down to the occupation in which\nshe was engaged, formed such a contrast to the flippant, bright,\nartificial girl who sat to be served with an air as haughty as a\nqueen on her throne.\n\n\"Oh, Mr Bellingham! I'm ashamed to detain you so long. I had no idea\nany one could have spent so much time over a little tear. No wonder\nMrs Mason charges so much for dress-making, if her work-women are so\nslow.\"\n\nIt was meant to be witty, but Mr Bellingham looked grave. He saw the\nscarlet colour of annoyance flush to that beautiful cheek which was\npartially presented to him. He took a candle from the table, and held\nit so that Ruth had more light. She did not look up to thank him, for\nshe felt ashamed that he should have seen the smile which she had\ncaught from him.\n\n\"I am sorry I have been so long, ma'am,\" said she, gently, as she\nfinished her work. \"I was afraid it might tear out again if I did not\ndo it carefully.\" She rose.\n\n\"I would rather have had it torn than have missed that charming\ngalop,\" said the young lady, shaking out her dress as a bird shakes\nits plumage. \"Shall we go, Mr Bellingham?\" looking up at him.\n\nHe was surprised that she gave no word or sign of thanks to the\nassistant. He took up a camellia that some one had left on the table.\n\n\"Allow me, Miss Duncombe, to give this in your name to this young\nlady, as thanks for her dexterous help.\"\n\n\"Oh--of course,\" said she.\n\nRuth received the flower silently, but with a grave, modest motion of\nher head. They had gone, and she was once more alone. Presently, her\ncompanions returned.\n\n\"What was the matter with Miss Duncombe? Did she come here?\" asked\nthey.\n\n\"Only her lace dress was torn, and I mended it,\" answered Ruth,\nquietly.\n\n\"Did Mr Bellingham come with her? They say he's going to be married\nto her; did he come, Ruth?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ruth, and relapsed into silence.\n\nMr Bellingham danced on gaily and merrily through the night, and\nflirted with Miss Duncombe, as he thought good. But he looked often\nto the side-door where the milliner's apprentices stood; and once he\nrecognised the tall, slight figure, and the rich auburn hair of the\ngirl in black; and then his eye sought for the camellia. It was\nthere, snowy white in her bosom. And he danced on more gaily than\never.\n\nThe cold grey dawn was drearily lighting up the streets when Mrs\nMason and her company returned home. The lamps were extinguished, yet\nthe shutters of the shops and dwelling-houses were not opened. All\nsounds had an echo unheard by day. One or two houseless beggars sat\non doorsteps, and, shivering, slept, with heads bowed on their knees,\nor resting against the cold hard support afforded by the wall.\n\nRuth felt as if a dream had melted away, and she were once more in\nthe actual world. How long it would be, even in the most favourable\nchance, before she should again enter the shire-hall! or hear a band\nof music! or even see again those bright, happy people--as much\nwithout any semblance of care or woe as if they belonged to another\nrace of beings. Had they ever to deny themselves a wish, much less\na want? Literally and figuratively, their lives seemed to wander\nthrough flowery pleasure-paths. Here was cold, biting mid-winter\nfor her, and such as her--for those poor beggars almost a season of\ndeath; but to Miss Duncombe and her companions, a happy, merry time,\nwhen flowers still bloomed, and fires crackled, and comforts and\nluxuries were piled around them like fairy gifts. What did they know\nof the meaning of the word, so terrific to the poor? What was winter\nto them? But Ruth fancied that Mr Bellingham looked as if he could\nunderstand the feelings of those removed from him by circumstance\nand station. He had drawn up the windows of his carriage, it is true,\nwith a shudder.\n\nRuth, then, had been watching him.\n\nYet she had no idea that any association made her camellia precious\nto her. She believed it was solely on account of its exquisite beauty\nthat she tended it so carefully. She told Jenny every particular of\nits presentation, with open, straight-looking eye, and without the\ndeepening of a shade of colour.\n\n\"Was it not kind of him? You can't think how nicely he did it, just\nwhen I was a little bit mortified by her ungracious ways.\"\n\n\"It was very nice, indeed,\" replied Jenny. \"Such a beautiful flower!\nI wish it had some scent.\"\n\n\"I wish it to be exactly as it is; it is perfect. So pure!\" said\nRuth, almost clasping her treasure as she placed it in water. \"Who is\nMr Bellingham?\"\n\n\"He is son to that Mrs Bellingham of the Priory, for whom we made the\ngrey satin pelisse,\" answered Jenny, sleepily.\n\n\"That was before my time,\" said Ruth. But there was no answer. Jenny\nwas asleep.\n\nIt was long before Ruth followed her example. Even on a winter day,\nit was clear morning light that fell upon her face as she smiled in\nher slumber. Jenny would not waken her, but watched her face with\nadmiration; it was so lovely in its happiness.\n\n\"She is dreaming of last night,\" thought Jenny.\n\nIt was true she was; but one figure flitted more than all the rest\nthrough her visions. He presented flower after flower to her in that\nbaseless morning dream, which was all too quickly ended. The night\nbefore, she had seen her dead mother in her sleep, and she wakened,\nweeping. And now she dreamed of Mr Bellingham, and smiled.\n\nAnd yet, was this a more evil dream than the other?\n\nThe realities of life seemed to cut more sharply against her heart\nthan usual that morning. The late hours of the preceding nights, and\nperhaps the excitement of the evening before, had indisposed her to\nbear calmly the rubs and crosses which beset all Mrs Mason's young\nladies at times.\n\nFor Mrs Mason, though the first dressmaker in the county, was human\nafter all; and suffered, like her apprentices, from the same causes\nthat affected them. This morning she was disposed to find fault\nwith everything, and everybody. She seemed to have risen with the\ndetermination of putting the world and all that it contained (her\nworld, at least) to rights before night; and abuses and negligences,\nwhich had long passed unreproved, or winked at, were to-day to\nbe dragged to light, and sharply reprimanded. Nothing less than\nperfection would satisfy Mrs Mason at such times.\n\nShe had her ideas of justice, too; but they were not divinely\nbeautiful and true ideas; they were something more resembling\na grocer's, or tea-dealer's ideas of equal right. A little\nover-indulgence last night was to be balanced by a good deal of\nover-severity to-day; and this manner of rectifying previous errors\nfully satisfied her conscience.\n\nRuth was not inclined for, or capable of, much extra exertion; and it\nwould have tasked all her powers to have pleased her superior. The\nwork-room seemed filled with sharp calls. \"Miss Hilton! where have\nyou put the blue Persian? Whenever things are mislaid, I know it has\nbeen Miss Hilton's evening for siding away!\"\n\n\"Miss Hilton was going out last night, so I offered to clear the\nworkroom for her. I will find it directly, ma'am,\" answered one of\nthe girls.\n\n\"Oh, I am well aware of Miss Hilton's custom of shuffling off her\nduties upon any one who can be induced to relieve her,\" replied Mrs\nMason.\n\nRuth reddened, and tears sprang to her eyes; but she was so conscious\nof the falsity of the accusation, that she rebuked herself for being\nmoved by it, and, raising her head, gave a proud look round, as if in\nappeal to her companions.\n\n\"Where is the skirt of Lady Farnham's dress? The flounces not put on!\nI am surprised. May I ask to whom this work was entrusted yesterday?\"\ninquired Mrs Mason, fixing her eyes on Ruth.\n\n\"I was to have done it, but I made a mistake, and had to undo it. I\nam very sorry.\"\n\n\"I might have guessed, certainly. There is little difficulty, to be\nsure, in discovering, when work has been neglected or spoilt, into\nwhose hands it has fallen.\"\n\nSuch were the speeches which fell to Ruth's share on this day of all\ndays, when she was least fitted to bear them with equanimity.\n\nIn the afternoon it was necessary for Mrs Mason to go a few miles\ninto the country. She left injunctions, and orders, and directions,\nand prohibitions without end; but at last she was gone, and in the\nrelief of her absence, Ruth laid her arms on the table, and, burying\nher head, began to cry aloud, with weak, unchecked sobs.\n\n\"Don't cry, Miss Hilton,\"--\"Ruthie, never mind the old dragon,\"--\"How\nwill you bear on for five years, if you don't spirit yourself up\nnot to care a straw for what she says?\"--were some of the modes of\ncomfort and sympathy administered by the young workwomen.\n\nJenny, with a wiser insight into the grievance and its remedy, said:\n\n\"Suppose Ruth goes out instead of you, Fanny Barton, to do the\nerrands. The fresh air will do her good; and you know you dislike the\ncold east winds, while Ruth says she enjoys frost and snow, and all\nkinds of shivery weather.\"\n\nFanny Barton was a great sleepy-looking girl, huddling over the\nfire. No one so willing as she to relinquish the walk on this bleak\nafternoon, when the east wind blew keenly down the street, drying up\nthe very snow itself. There was no temptation to come abroad, for\nthose who were not absolutely obliged to leave their warm rooms;\nindeed, the dusk hour showed that it was the usual tea-time for the\nhumble inhabitants of that part of the town through which Ruth had to\npass on her shopping expedition. As she came to the high ground just\nabove the river, where the street sloped rapidly down to the bridge,\nshe saw the flat country beyond all covered with snow, making the\nblack dome of the cloud-laden sky appear yet blacker; as if the\nwinter's night had never fairly gone away, but had hovered on the\nedge of the world all through the short bleak day. Down by the bridge\n(where there was a little shelving bank, used as a landing-place for\nany pleasure-boats that could float on that shallow stream) some\nchildren were playing, and defying the cold; one of them had got a\nlarge washing-tub, and with the use of a broken oar kept steering and\npushing himself hither and thither in the little creek, much to the\nadmiration of his companions, who stood gravely looking on, immovable\nin their attentive observation of the hero, although their faces were\nblue with cold, and their hands crammed deep into their pockets with\nsome faint hope of finding warmth there. Perhaps they feared that, if\nthey unpacked themselves from their lumpy attitudes and began to move\nabout, the cruel wind would find its way into every cranny of their\ntattered dress. They were all huddled up, and still; with eyes\nintent on the embryo sailor. At last, one little man, envious of the\nreputation that his playfellow was acquiring by his daring, called\nout:\n\n\"I'll set thee a craddy, Tom! Thou dar'n't go over yon black line in\nthe water, out into the real river.\"\n\nOf course the challenge was not to be refused, and Tom paddled away\ntowards the dark line, beyond which the river swept with smooth,\nsteady current. Ruth (a child in years herself) stood at the top of\nthe declivity watching the adventurer, but as unconscious of any\ndanger as the group of children below. At their playfellow's success,\nthey broke through the calm gravity of observation into boisterous\nmarks of applause, clapping their hands, and stamping their impatient\nlittle feet, and shouting, \"Well done, Tom; thou hast done it\nrarely!\"\n\nTom stood in childish dignity for a moment, facing his admirers;\nthen, in an instant, his washing-tub boat was whirled round, and he\nlost his balance, and fell out; and both he and his boat were carried\naway slowly, but surely, by the strong full river which eternally\nmoved onwards to the sea.\n\nThe children shrieked aloud with terror; and Ruth flew down to the\nlittle bay, and far into its shallow waters, before she felt how\nuseless such an action was, and that the sensible plan would have\nbeen to seek for efficient help. Hardly had this thought struck her,\nwhen, louder and sharper than the sullen roar of the stream that was\nceaselessly and unrelentingly flowing on, came the splash of a horse\ngalloping through the water in which she was standing. Past her like\nlightning--down in the stream, swimming along with the current--a\nstooping rider--an outstretched, grasping arm--a little life\nredeemed, and a child saved to those who loved it! Ruth stood dizzy\nand sick with emotion while all this took place; and when the rider\nturned his swimming horse, and slowly breasted up the river to the\nlanding-place, she recognised him as the Mr Bellingham of the night\nbefore. He carried the unconscious child across his horse; the body\nhung in so lifeless a manner that Ruth believed it was dead, and her\neyes were suddenly blinded with tears. She waded back to the beach,\nto the point towards which Mr Bellingham was directing his horse.\n\n\"Is he dead?\" asked she, stretching out her arms to receive the\nlittle fellow; for she instinctively felt that the position in which\nhe hung was not the most conducive to returning consciousness, if,\nindeed, it would ever return.\n\n\"I think not,\" answered Mr Bellingham, as he gave the child to her,\nbefore springing off his horse. \"Is he your brother? Do you know who\nhe is?\"\n\n\"Look!\" said Ruth, who had sat down upon the ground, the better to\nprop the poor lad, \"his hand twitches! he lives! oh, sir, he lives!\nWhose boy is he?\" (to the people, who came hurrying and gathering to\nthe spot at the rumour of an accident).\n\n\"He's old Nelly Brownson's,\" said they. \"Her grandson.\"\n\n\"We must take him into a house directly,\" said she. \"Is his home far\noff?\"\n\n\"No, no; it's just close by.\"\n\n\"One of you go for a doctor at once,\" said Mr Bellingham,\nauthoritatively, \"and bring him to the old woman's without delay. You\nmust not hold him any longer,\" he continued, speaking to Ruth, and\nremembering her face now for the first time; \"your dress is dripping\nwet already. Here! you fellow, take him up, d'ye see!\"\n\nBut the child's hand had nervously clenched Ruth's dress, and she\nwould not have him disturbed. She carried her heavy burden very\ntenderly towards a mean little cottage indicated by the neighbours;\nan old crippled woman was coming out of the door, shaking all over\nwith agitation.\n\n\"Dear heart!\" said she, \"he's the last of 'em all, and he's gone\nafore me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Mr Bellingham, \"the boy is alive, and likely to\nlive.\"\n\nBut the old woman was helpless and hopeless, and insisted on\nbelieving that her grandson was dead; and dead he would have been\nif it had not been for Ruth, and one or two of the more sensible\nneighbours, who, under Mr Bellingham's directions, bustled about, and\ndid all that was necessary until animation was restored.\n\n\"What a confounded time these people are in fetching the doctor,\"\nsaid Mr Bellingham to Ruth, between whom and himself a sort of\nsilent understanding had sprung up from the circumstance of their\nhaving been the only two (besides mere children) who had witnessed\nthe accident, and also the only two to whom a certain degree of\ncultivation had given the power of understanding each other's\nthoughts and even each other's words.\n\n\"It takes so much to knock an idea into such stupid people's heads.\nThey stood gaping and asking which doctor they were to go for, as if\nit signified whether it was Brown or Smith, so long as he had his\nwits about him. I have no more time to waste here, either; I was on\nthe gallop when I caught sight of the lad; and, now he has fairly\nsobbed and opened his eyes, I see no use in my staying in this\nstifling atmosphere. May I trouble you with one thing? Will you be\nso good as to see that the little fellow has all that he wants? If\nyou'll allow me, I'll leave you my purse,\" continued he, giving it to\nRuth, who was only too glad to have this power entrusted to her of\nprocuring one or two requisites which she had perceived to be wanted.\nBut she saw some gold between the net-work; she did not like the\ncharge of such riches.\n\n\"I shall not want so much, really, sir. One sovereign will be\nplenty--more than enough. May I take that out, and I will give you\nback what is left of it when I see you again? or, perhaps I had\nbetter send it to you, sir?\"\n\n\"I think you had better keep it all at present. Oh! what a horrid\ndirty place this is; insufferable two minutes longer. You must not\nstay here; you'll be poisoned with this abominable air. Come towards\nthe door, I beg. Well, if you think one sovereign will be enough, I\nwill take my purse; only, remember you apply to me if you think they\nwant more.\"\n\nThey were standing at the door, where some one was holding Mr\nBellingham's horse. Ruth was looking at him with her earnest eyes\n(Mrs Mason and her errands quite forgotten in the interest of\nthe afternoon's event), her whole thoughts bent upon rightly\nunderstanding and following out his wishes for the little boy's\nwelfare; and until now this had been the first object in his own\nmind. But at this moment the strong perception of Ruth's exceeding\nbeauty came again upon him. He almost lost the sense of what he was\nsaying, he was so startled into admiration. The night before, he had\nnot seen her eyes; and now they looked straight and innocently full\nat him, grave, earnest, and deep. But when she instinctively read the\nchange in the expression of his countenance, she dropped her large\nwhite veiling lids; and he thought her face was lovelier still.\n\nThe irresistible impulse seized him to arrange matters so that he\nmight see her again before long.\n\n\"No!\" said he. \"I see it would be better that you should keep\nthe purse. Many things may be wanted for the lad which we cannot\ncalculate upon now. If I remember rightly, there are three sovereigns\nand some loose change; I shall, perhaps, see you again in a few days,\nwhen, if there be any money left in the purse, you can restore it to\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Ruth, alive to the magnitude of the wants to\nwhich she might have to administer, and yet rather afraid of the\nresponsibility implied in the possession of so much money.\n\n\"Is there any chance of my meeting you again in this house?\" asked\nhe.\n\n\"I hope to come whenever I can, sir; but I must run in errand-times,\nand I don't know when my turn may be.\"\n\n\"Oh\"--he did not fully understand this answer--\"I should like to know\nhow you think the boy is going on, if it is not giving you too much\ntrouble; do you ever take walks?\"\n\n\"Not for walking's sake, sir.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said he, \"you go to church, I suppose? Mrs Mason does not\nkeep you at work on Sundays, I trust?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir. I go to church regularly.\"\n\n\"Then, perhaps, you will be so good as to tell me what church you go\nto, and I will meet you there next Sunday afternoon?\"\n\n\"I go to St Nicholas', sir. I will take care and bring you word how\nthe boy is, and what doctor they get; and I will keep an account of\nthe money I spend.\"\n\n\"Very well; thank you. Remember, I trust to you.\"\n\nHe meant that he relied on her promise to meet him; but Ruth thought\nthat he was referring to the responsibility of doing the best she\ncould for the child. He was going away, when a fresh thought struck\nhim, and he turned back into the cottage once more, and addressed\nRuth, with a half smile on his countenance:\n\n\"It seems rather strange, but we have no one to introduce us; my name\nis Bellingham--yours is--?\"\n\n\"Ruth Hilton, sir,\" she answered, in a low voice, for, now that\nthe conversation no longer related to the boy, she felt shy and\nrestrained.\n\nHe held out his hand to shake hers, and just as she gave it to him,\nthe old grandmother came tottering up to ask some question. The\ninterruption jarred upon him, and made him once more keenly alive to\nthe closeness of the air, and the squalor and dirt by which he was\nsurrounded.\n\n\"My good woman,\" said he to Nelly Brownson, \"could you not keep your\nplace a little neater and cleaner? It is more fit for pigs than human\nbeings. The air in this room is quite offensive, and the dirt and\nfilth is really disgraceful.\"\n\nBy this time he was mounted, and, bowing to Ruth, he rode away.\n\nThen the old woman's wrath broke out.\n\n\"Who may you be, that knows no better manners than to come into a\npoor woman's house to abuse it?--fit for pigs, indeed! What d'ye call\nyon fellow?\"\n\n\"He is Mr Bellingham,\" said Ruth, shocked at the old woman's apparent\ningratitude. \"It was he that rode into the water to save your\ngrandson. He would have been drowned but for Mr Bellingham. I thought\nonce they would both have been swept away by the current, it was so\nstrong.\"\n\n\"The river is none so deep, either,\" the old woman said, anxious to\ndiminish as much as possible the obligation she was under to one who\nhad offended her. \"Some one else would have saved him, if this fine\nyoung spark had never been near. He's an orphan, and God watches over\norphans, they say. I'd rather it had been any one else as had picked\nhim out, than one who comes into a poor body's house only to abuse\nit.\"\n\n\"He did not come in only to abuse it,\" said Ruth, gently. \"He came\nwith little Tom; he only said it was not quite so clean as it might\nbe.\"\n\n\"What! you're taking up the cry, are you? Wait till you are an old\nwoman like me, crippled with rheumatiz, and a lad to see after like\nTom, who is always in mud when he isn't in water; and his food and\nmine to scrape together (God knows we're often short, and do the best\nI can), and water to fetch up that steep brow.\"\n\nShe stopped to cough; and Ruth judiciously changed the subject, and\nbegan to consult the old woman as to the wants of her grandson, in\nwhich consultation they were soon assisted by the medical man.\n\nWhen Ruth had made one or two arrangements with a neighbour, whom she\nasked to procure the most necessary things, and had heard from the\ndoctor that all would be right in a day or two, she began to quake\nat the recollection of the length of time she had spent at Nelly\nBrownson's, and to remember, with some affright, the strict watch\nkept by Mrs Mason over her apprentices' out-goings and in-comings on\nworking days. She hurried off to the shops, and tried to recall her\nwandering thoughts to the respective merits of pink and blue as a\nmatch to lilac, found she had lost her patterns, and went home with\nill-chosen things, and in a fit of despair at her own stupidity.\n\nThe truth was, that the afternoon's adventure filled her mind; only,\nthe figure of Tom (who was now safe, and likely to do well) was\nreceding into the background, and that of Mr Bellingham becoming\nmore prominent than it had been. His spirited and natural action of\ngalloping into the water to save the child, was magnified by Ruth\ninto the most heroic deed of daring; his interest about the boy\nwas tender, thoughtful benevolence in her eyes, and his careless\nliberality of money was fine generosity; for she forgot that\ngenerosity implies some degree of self-denial. She was gratified,\ntoo, by the power of dispensing comfort he had entrusted to her,\nand was busy with Alnaschar visions of wise expenditure, when the\nnecessity of opening Mrs Mason's house-door summoned her back into\nactual present life, and the dread of an immediate scolding.\n\nFor this time, however, she was spared; but spared for such a reason\nthat she would have been thankful for some blame in preference to\nher impunity. During her absence, Jenny's difficulty of breathing\nhad suddenly become worse, and the girls had, on their own\nresponsibility, put her to bed, and were standing round her in\ndismay, when Mrs Mason's return home (only a few minutes before Ruth\narrived) fluttered them back into the workroom.\n\nAnd now, all was confusion and hurry; a doctor to be sent for; a mind\nto be unburdened of directions for a dress to a forewoman, who was\ntoo ill to understand; scoldings to be scattered with no illiberal\nhand amongst a group of frightened girls, hardly sparing the poor\ninvalid herself for her inopportune illness. In the middle of all\nthis turmoil, Ruth crept quietly to her place, with a heavy saddened\nheart at the indisposition of the gentle forewoman. She would gladly\nhave nursed Jenny herself, and often longed to do it, but she could\nnot be spared. Hands, unskilful in fine and delicate work, would be\nwell enough qualified to tend the sick, until the mother arrived from\nhome. Meanwhile, extra diligence was required in the workroom; and\nRuth found no opportunity of going to see little Tom, or to fulfil\nthe plans for making him and his grandmother more comfortable, which\nshe had proposed to herself. She regretted her rash promise to Mr\nBellingham, of attending to the little boy's welfare; all that she\ncould do was done by means of Mrs Mason's servant, through whom she\nmade inquiries, and sent the necessary help.\n\nThe subject of Jenny's illness was the prominent one in the house.\nRuth told of her own adventure, to be sure; but when she was at the\nvery crisis of the boy's fall into the river, the more fresh and\nvivid interest of some tidings of Jenny was brought into the room,\nand Ruth ceased, almost blaming herself for caring for anything\nbesides the question of life or death to be decided in that very\nhouse.\n\nThen a pale, gentle-looking woman was seen moving softly about; and\nit was whispered that this was the mother come to nurse her child.\nEverybody liked her, she was so sweet-looking, and gave so little\ntrouble, and seemed so patient, and so thankful for any inquiries\nabout her daughter, whose illness, it was understood, although its\nseverity was mitigated, was likely to be long and tedious. While all\nthe feelings and thoughts relating to Jenny were predominant, Sunday\narrived. Mrs Mason went the accustomed visit to her father's, making\nsome little show of apology to Mrs Wood for leaving her and her\ndaughter; the apprentices dispersed to the various friends with whom\nthey were in the habit of spending the day; and Ruth went to St\nNicholas', with a sorrowful heart, depressed on account of Jenny, and\nself-reproachful at having rashly undertaken what she had been unable\nto perform.\n\nAs she came out of church, she was joined by Mr Bellingham. She had\nhalf hoped that he might have forgotten the arrangement, and yet she\nwished to relieve herself of her responsibility. She knew his step\nbehind her, and the contending feelings made her heart beat hard, and\nshe longed to run away.\n\n\"Miss Hilton, I believe,\" said he, overtaking her, and bowing\nforward, so as to catch a sight of her rose-red face. \"How is our\nlittle sailor going on? Well, I trust, from the symptoms the other\nday.\"\n\n\"I believe, sir, he is quite well now. I am very sorry, but I have\nnot been able to go and see him. I am so sorry--I could not help it.\nBut I have got one or two things through another person. I have put\nthem down on this slip of paper; and here is your purse, sir, for\nI am afraid I can do nothing more for him. We have illness in the\nhouse, and it makes us very busy.\"\n\nRuth had been so much accustomed to blame of late, that she almost\nanticipated some remonstrance or reproach now, for not having\nfulfilled her promise better. She little guessed that Mr Bellingham\nwas far more busy trying to devise some excuse for meeting her again,\nduring the silence that succeeded her speech, than displeased with\nher for not bringing a more particular account of the little boy, in\nwhom he had ceased to feel any interest.\n\nShe repeated, after a minute's pause:\n\n\"I am very sorry I have done so little, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I am sure you have done all you could. It was thoughtless\nin me to add to your engagements.\"\n\n\"He is displeased with me,\" thought Ruth, \"for what he believes to\nhave been neglect of the boy, whose life he risked his own to save.\nIf I told all, he would see that I could not do more; but I cannot\ntell him all the sorrows and worries that have taken up my time.\"\n\n\"And yet I am tempted to give you another little commission, if it is\nnot taking up too much of your time, and presuming too much on your\ngood-nature,\" said he, a bright idea having just struck him. \"Mrs\nMason lives in Heneage Place, does not she? My mother's ancestors\nlived there; and once, when the house was being repaired, she took me\nin to show me the old place. There was an old hunting-piece painted\non a panel over one of the chimney-pieces; the figures were portraits\nof my ancestors. I have often thought I should like to purchase it,\nif it still remained there. Can you ascertain this for me, and bring\nme word next Sunday?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Ruth, glad that this commission was completely\nwithin her power to execute, and anxious to make up for her previous\nseeming neglect. \"I'll look directly I get home, and ask Mrs Mason to\nwrite and let you know.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said he, only half satisfied; \"I think perhaps, however,\nit might be as well not to trouble Mrs Mason about it; you see, it\nwould compromise me, and I am not quite determined to purchase the\npicture; if you would ascertain whether the painting is there, and\ntell me, I would take a little time to reflect, and afterwards I\ncould apply to Mrs Mason myself.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir; I will see about it.\" So they parted.\n\nBefore the next Sunday, Mrs Wood had taken her daughter to her\ndistant home, to recruit in that quiet place. Ruth watched her down\nthe street from an upper window, and, sighing deep and long, returned\nto the workroom, whence the warning voice and the gentle wisdom had\ndeparted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nSunday at Mrs Mason's\n\n\nMr Bellingham attended afternoon service at St Nicholas' church the\nnext Sunday. His thoughts had been far more occupied by Ruth than\nhers by him, although his appearance upon the scene of her life\nwas more an event to her than it was to him. He was puzzled by the\nimpression she had produced on him, though he did not in general\nanalyse the nature of his feelings, but simply enjoyed them with the\ndelight which youth takes in experiencing new and strong emotion.\n\nHe was old compared to Ruth, but young as a man; hardly\nthree-and-twenty. The fact of his being an only child had given\nhim, as it does to many, a sort of inequality in those parts of the\ncharacter which are usually formed by the number of years that a\nperson has lived.\n\nThe unevenness of discipline to which only children are subjected;\nthe thwarting, resulting from over-anxiety; the indiscreet\nindulgence, arising from a love centred all in one object; had been\nexaggerated in his education, probably from the circumstance that his\nmother (his only surviving parent) had been similarly situated to\nhimself.\n\nHe was already in possession of the comparatively small property\nhe inherited from his father. The estate on which his mother lived\nwas her own; and her income gave her the means of indulging or\ncontrolling him, after he had grown to man's estate, as her wayward\ndisposition and her love of power prompted her.\n\nHad he been double-dealing in his conduct towards her, had he\ncondescended to humour her in the least, her passionate love for him\nwould have induced her to strip herself of all her possessions to\nadd to his dignity or happiness. But although he felt the warmest\naffection for her, the regardlessness which she had taught him (by\nexample, perhaps, more than by precept) of the feelings of others,\nwas continually prompting him to do things that she, for the time\nbeing, resented as mortal affronts. He would mimic the clergyman she\nspecially esteemed, even to his very face; he would refuse to visit\nher schools for months and months; and, when wearied into going\nat last, revenge himself by puzzling the children with the most\nridiculous questions (gravely put) that he could imagine.\n\nAll these boyish tricks annoyed and irritated her far more than the\naccounts which reached her of more serious misdoings at college and\nin town. Of these grave offences she never spoke; of the smaller\nmisdeeds she hardly ever ceased speaking.\n\nStill, at times, she had great influence over him, and nothing\ndelighted her more than to exercise it. The submission of his will\nto hers was sure to be liberally rewarded; for it gave her great\nhappiness to extort, from his indifference or his affection, the\nconcessions which she never sought by force of reason, or by appeals\nto principle--concessions which he frequently withheld, solely for\nthe sake of asserting his independence of her control.\n\nShe was anxious for him to marry Miss Duncombe. He cared little or\nnothing about it--it was time enough to be married ten years hence;\nand so he was dawdling through some months of his life--sometimes\nflirting with the nothing-loath Miss Duncombe, sometimes plaguing,\nand sometimes delighting his mother, at all times taking care to\nplease himself--when he first saw Ruth Hilton, and a new, passionate,\nhearty feeling shot through his whole being. He did not know why he\nwas so fascinated by her. She was very beautiful, but he had seen\nothers equally beautiful, and with many more _agaceries_ calculated\nto set off the effect of their charms.\n\nThere was, perhaps, something bewitching in the union of the\ngrace and loveliness of womanhood with the _na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9_, simplicity,\nand innocence of an intelligent child. There was a spell in the\nshyness, which made her avoid and shun all admiring approaches to\nacquaintance. It would be an exquisite delight to attract and tame\nher wildness, just as he had often allured and tamed the timid fawns\nin his mother's park.\n\nBy no over-bold admiration, or rash, passionate word, would he\nstartle her; and, surely, in time she might be induced to look upon\nhim as a friend, if not something nearer and dearer still.\n\nIn accordance with this determination, he resisted the strong\ntemptation of walking by her side the whole distance home after\nchurch. He only received the intelligence she brought respecting the\npanel with thanks, spoke a few words about the weather, bowed, and\nwas gone. Ruth believed she should never see him again; and, in spite\nof sundry self-upbraidings for her folly, she could not help feeling\nas if a shadow were drawn over her existence for several days to\ncome.\n\nMrs Mason was a widow, and had to struggle for the sake of the six or\nseven children left dependent on her exertions; thus there was some\nreason, and great excuse, for the pinching economy which regulated\nher household affairs.\n\nOn Sundays she chose to conclude that all her apprentices had friends\nwho would be glad to see them to dinner, and give them a welcome\nreception for the remainder of the day; while she, and those of\nher children who were not at school, went to spend the day at her\nfather's house, several miles out of the town. Accordingly, no\ndinner was cooked on Sundays for the young workwomen; no fires were\nlighted in any rooms to which they had access. On this morning they\nbreakfasted in Mrs Mason's own parlour, after which the room was\nclosed against them through the day by some understood, though\nunspoken prohibition.\n\nWhat became of such as Ruth, who had no home and no friends in that\nlarge, populous, desolate town? She had hitherto commissioned the\nservant, who went to market on Saturdays for the family, to buy her a\nbun or biscuit, whereon she made her fasting dinner in the deserted\nworkroom, sitting in her walking-dress to keep off the cold, which\nclung to her in spite of shawl and bonnet. Then she would sit at\nthe window, looking out on the dreary prospect till her eyes were\noften blinded by tears; and, partly to shake off thoughts and\nrecollections, the indulgence in which she felt to be productive\nof no good, and partly to have some ideas to dwell upon during the\ncoming week beyond those suggested by the constant view of the same\nroom, she would carry her Bible, and place herself in the window-seat\non the wide landing, which commanded the street in front of the\nhouse. From thence she could see the irregular grandeur of the place;\nshe caught a view of the grey church-tower, rising hoary and massive\ninto mid-air; she saw one or two figures loiter along on the sunny\nside of the street, in all the enjoyment of their fine clothes and\nSunday leisure; and she imagined histories for them, and tried to\npicture to herself their homes and their daily doings.\n\nAnd before long, the bells swung heavily in the church-tower, and\nstruck out with musical clang the first summons to afternoon church.\n\nAfter church was over, she used to return home to the same\nwindow-seat, and watch till the winter twilight was over and gone,\nand the stars came out over the black masses of houses. And then she\nwould steal down to ask for a candle, as a companion to her in the\ndeserted workroom. Occasionally the servant would bring her up some\ntea; but of late Ruth had declined taking any, as she had discovered\nshe was robbing the kind-hearted creature of part of the small\nprovision left out for her by Mrs Mason. She sat on, hungry and cold,\ntrying to read her Bible, and to think the old holy thoughts which\nhad been her childish meditations at her mother's knee, until one\nafter another the apprentices returned, weary with their day's\nenjoyment, and their week's late watching; too weary to make her in\nany way a partaker of their pleasure by entering into details of the\nmanner in which they had spent their day.\n\nAnd last of all, Mrs Mason returned; and, summoning her \"young\npeople\" once more into the parlour, she read a prayer before\ndismissing them to bed. She always expected to find them all in\nthe house when she came home, but asked no questions as to their\nproceedings through the day; perhaps because she dreaded to hear\nthat one or two had occasionally nowhere to go, and that it would be\nsometimes necessary to order a Sunday's dinner, and leave a lighted\nfire on that day.\n\nFor five months Ruth had been an inmate at Mrs Mason's, and such had\nbeen the regular order of the Sundays. While the forewoman stayed\nthere, it is true, she was ever ready to give Ruth the little variety\nof hearing of recreations in which she was no partaker; and however\ntired Jenny might be at night, she had ever some sympathy to bestow\non Ruth for the dull length of day she had passed. After her\ndeparture, the monotonous idleness of the Sunday seemed worse to\nbear than the incessant labour of the work-days; until the time came\nwhen it seemed to be a recognised hope in her mind, that on Sunday\nafternoons she should see Mr Bellingham, and hear a few words from\nhim, as from a friend who took an interest in her thoughts and\nproceedings during the past week.\n\nRuth's mother had been the daughter of a poor curate in Norfolk,\nand, early left without parents or home, she was thankful to marry\na respectable farmer a good deal older than herself. After their\nmarriage, however, everything seemed to go wrong. Mrs Hilton fell\ninto a delicate state of health, and was unable to bestow the\never-watchful attention to domestic affairs so requisite in a\nfarmer's wife. Her husband had a series of misfortunes--of a more\nimportant kind than the death of a whole brood of turkeys from\ngetting among the nettles, or the year of bad cheeses spoilt by a\ncareless dairymaid--which were the consequences (so the neighbours\nsaid) of Mr Hilton's mistake in marrying a delicate, fine lady. His\ncrops failed; his horses died; his barn took fire; in short, if he\nhad been in any way a remarkable character, one might have supposed\nhim to be the object of an avenging fate, so successive were the\nevils which pursued him; but as he was only a somewhat commonplace\nfarmer, I believe we must attribute his calamities to some want in\nhis character of the one quality required to act as keystone to many\nexcellences. While his wife lived, all worldly misfortunes seemed as\nnothing to him; her strong sense and lively faculty of hope upheld\nhim from despair; her sympathy was always ready, and the invalid's\nroom had an atmosphere of peace and encouragement, which affected all\nwho entered it. But when Ruth was about twelve, one morning in the\nbusy hay-time, Mrs Hilton was left alone for some hours. This had\noften happened before, nor had she seemed weaker than usual when they\nhad gone forth to the field; but on their return, with merry voices,\nto fetch the dinner prepared for the haymakers, they found an unusual\nsilence brooding over the house; no low voice called out gently to\nwelcome them, and ask after the day's progress; and, on entering the\nlittle parlour, which was called Mrs Hilton's, and was sacred to her,\nthey found her lying dead on her accustomed sofa. Quite calm and\npeaceful she lay; there had been no struggle at last; the struggle\nwas for the survivors, and one sank under it. Her husband did not\nmake much ado at first--at least, not in outward show; her memory\nseemed to keep in check all external violence of grief; but, day by\nday, dating from his wife's death, his mental powers decreased. He\nwas still a hale-looking elderly man, and his bodily health appeared\nas good as ever; but he sat for hours in his easy-chair, looking into\nthe fire, not moving, nor speaking, unless when it was absolutely\nnecessary to answer repeated questions. If Ruth, with coaxings and\ndraggings, induced him to come out with her, he went with measured\nsteps around his fields, his head bent to the ground with the\nsame abstracted, unseeing look; never smiling--never changing the\nexpression of his face, not even to one of deeper sadness, when\nanything occurred which might be supposed to remind him of his dead\nwife. But in this abstraction from all outward things, his worldly\naffairs went ever lower down. He paid money away, or received it, as\nif it had been so much water; the gold mines of Potosi could not have\ntouched the deep grief of his soul; but God in His mercy knew the\nsure balm, and sent the Beautiful Messenger to take the weary one\nhome.\n\nAfter his death, the creditors were the chief people who appeared to\ntake any interest in the affairs; and it seemed strange to Ruth to\nsee people, whom she scarcely knew, examining and touching all that\nshe had been accustomed to consider as precious and sacred. Her\nfather had made his will at her birth. With the pride of newly and\nlate-acquired paternity, he had considered the office of guardian to\nhis little darling as one which would have been an additional honour\nto the lord-lieutenant of the county; but as he had not the pleasure\nof his lordship's acquaintance, he selected the person of most\nconsequence amongst those whom he did know; not any very ambitious\nappointment, in those days of comparative prosperity; but certainly\nthe flourishing maltster of Skelton was a little surprised, when,\nfifteen years later, he learnt that he was executor to a will\nbequeathing many vanished hundreds of pounds, and guardian to a young\ngirl whom he could not remember ever to have seen.\n\nHe was a sensible, hard-headed man of the world; having a very fair\nproportion of conscience as consciences go; indeed, perhaps more than\nmany people; for he had some ideas of duty extending to the circle\nbeyond his own family; and did not, as some would have done, decline\nacting altogether, but speedily summoned the creditors, examined\ninto the accounts, sold up the farming-stock, and discharged all the\ndebts; paid about \u00c2\u00a380 into the Skelton bank for a week, while he\ninquired for a situation or apprenticeship of some kind for poor\nheart-broken Ruth; heard of Mrs Mason's; arranged all with her in two\nshort conversations; drove over for Ruth in his gig; waited while she\nand the old servant packed up her clothes; and grew very impatient\nwhile she ran, with her eyes streaming with tears, round the garden,\ntearing off in a passion of love whole boughs of favourite China and\ndamask roses, late flowering against the casement-window of what\nhad been her mother's room. When she took her seat in the gig, she\nwas little able, even if she had been inclined, to profit by her\nguardian's lectures on economy and self-reliance; but she was quiet\nand silent, looking forward with longing to the night-time, when, in\nher bedroom, she might give way to all her passionate sorrow at being\nwrenched from the home where she had lived with her parents, in that\nutter absence of any anticipation of change, which is either the\nblessing or the curse of childhood. But at night there were four\nother girls in her room, and she could not cry before them. She\nwatched and waited till, one by one, they dropped off to sleep, and\nthen she buried her face in the pillow, and shook with sobbing grief;\nand then she paused to conjure up, with fond luxuriance, every\nrecollection of the happy days, so little valued in their uneventful\npeace while they lasted, so passionately regretted when once gone for\never; to remember every look and word of the dear mother, and to moan\nafresh over the change caused by her death;--the first clouding in\nof Ruth's day of life. It was Jenny's sympathy on this first night,\nwhen awakened by Ruth's irrepressible agony, that had made the bond\nbetween them. But Ruth's loving disposition, continually sending\nforth fibres in search of nutriment, found no other object for regard\namong those of her daily life to compensate for the want of natural\nties.\n\nBut, almost insensibly, Jenny's place in Ruth's heart was filled\nup; there was some one who listened with tender interest to all\nher little revelations; who questioned her about her early days\nof happiness, and, in return, spoke of his own childhood--not so\ngolden in reality as Ruth's, but more dazzling, when recounted\nwith stories of the beautiful cream-coloured Arabian pony, and the\nold picture-gallery in the house, and avenues, and terraces, and\nfountains in the garden, for Ruth to paint, with all the vividness\nof imagination, as scenery and background for the figure which was\ngrowing by slow degrees most prominent in her thoughts.\n\nIt must not be supposed that this was effected all at once, though\nthe intermediate stages have been passed over. On Sunday, Mr\nBellingham only spoke to her to receive the information about\nthe panel; nor did he come to St Nicholas' the next, nor yet the\nfollowing Sunday. But the third he walked by her side a little way,\nand, seeing her annoyance, he left her; and then she wished for him\nback again, and found the day very dreary, and wondered why a strange\nundefined feeling had made her imagine she was doing wrong in walking\nalongside of one so kind and good as Mr Bellingham; it had been very\nfoolish of her to be self-conscious all the time, and if ever he\nspoke to her again she would not think of what people might say,\nbut enjoy the pleasure which his kind words and evident interest in\nher might give. Then she thought it was very likely he never would\nnotice her again, for she knew she had been very rude with her short\nanswers; it was very provoking that she had behaved so rudely. She\nshould be sixteen in another month, and she was still childish and\nawkward. Thus she lectured herself, after parting with Mr Bellingham;\nand the consequence was, that on the following Sunday she was ten\ntimes as blushing and conscious, and (Mr Bellingham thought) ten\ntimes more beautiful than ever. He suggested, that instead of going\nstraight home through High-street, she should take the round by the\nLeasowes; at first she declined, but then, suddenly wondering and\nquestioning herself why she refused a thing which was, as far as\nreason and knowledge (_her_ knowledge) went, so innocent, and which\nwas certainly so tempting and pleasant, she agreed to go the round;\nand when she was once in the meadows that skirted the town, she\nforgot all doubt and awkwardness--nay, almost forgot the presence of\nMr Bellingham--in her delight at the new tender beauty of an early\nspring day in February. Among the last year's brown ruins, heaped\ntogether by the wind in the hedgerows, she found the fresh green\ncrinkled leaves and pale star-like flowers of the primroses. Here and\nthere a golden celandine made brilliant the sides of the little brook\nthat (full of water in \"February fill-dyke\") bubbled along by the\nside of the path; the sun was low in the horizon, and once, when they\ncame to a higher part of the Leasowes, Ruth burst into an exclamation\nof delight at the evening glory of mellow light which was in the sky\nbehind the purple distance, while the brown leafless woods in the\nforeground derived an almost metallic lustre from the golden mist and\nhaze of the sunset. It was but three-quarters of a mile round by the\nmeadows, but somehow it took them an hour to walk it. Ruth turned\nto thank Mr Bellingham for his kindness in taking her home by this\nbeautiful way, but his look of admiration at her glowing, animated\nface, made her suddenly silent; and, hardly wishing him good-bye, she\nquickly entered the house with a beating, happy, agitated heart.\n\n\"How strange it is,\" she thought that evening, \"that I should feel as\nif this charming afternoon's walk were, somehow, not exactly wrong,\nbut yet as if it were not right. Why can it be? I am not defrauding\nMrs Mason of any of her time; that I know would be wrong; I am left\nto go where I like on Sundays. I have been to church, so it can't be\nbecause I have missed doing my duty. If I had gone this walk with\nJenny, I wonder whether I should have felt as I do now. There must\nbe something wrong in me, myself, to feel so guilty when I have done\nnothing which is not right; and yet I can thank God for the happiness\nI have had in this charming spring walk, which dear mamma used to say\nwas a sign when pleasures were innocent and good for us.\"\n\nShe was not conscious, as yet, that Mr Bellingham's presence had\nadded any charm to the ramble; and when she might have become aware\nof this, as, week after week, Sunday after Sunday, loitering ramble\nafter loitering ramble succeeded each other, she was too much\nabsorbed with one set of thoughts to have much inclination for\nself-questioning.\n\n\"Tell me everything, Ruth, as you would to a brother; let me help\nyou, if I can, in your difficulties,\" he said to her one afternoon.\nAnd he really did try to understand, and to realise, how an\ninsignificant and paltry person like Mason the dressmaker could be an\nobject of dread, and regarded as a person having authority, by Ruth.\nHe flamed up with indignation when, by way of impressing him with Mrs\nMason's power and consequence, Ruth spoke of some instance of the\neffects of her employer's displeasure. He declared his mother should\nnever have a gown made again by such a tyrant--such a Mrs Brownrigg;\nthat he would prevent all his acquaintances from going to such\na cruel dressmaker; till Ruth was alarmed at the threatened\nconsequences of her one-sided account, and pleaded for Mrs Mason as\nearnestly as if a young man's menace of this description were likely\nto be literally fulfilled.\n\n\"Indeed, sir, I have been very wrong; if you please, sir, don't be so\nangry. She is often very good to us; it is only sometimes she goes\ninto a passion; and we are very provoking, I dare say. I know I am\nfor one. I have often to undo my work, and you can't think how it\nspoils anything (particularly silk) to be unpicked; and Mrs Mason has\nto bear all the blame. Oh! I am sorry I said anything about it. Don't\nspeak to your mother about it, pray, sir. Mrs Mason thinks so much of\nMrs Bellingham's custom.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't this time\"--recollecting that there might be some\nawkwardness in accounting to his mother for the means by which he\nhad obtained his very correct information as to what passed in Mrs\nMason's workroom--\"but if ever she does so again, I'll not answer for\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I will take care and not tell again, sir,\" said Ruth, in a low\nvoice.\n\n\"Nay, Ruth, you are not going to have secrets from me, are you? Don't\nyou remember your promise to consider me as a brother? Go on telling\nme everything that happens to you, pray; you cannot think how much\ninterest I take in all your interests. I can quite fancy that\ncharming home at Milham you told me about last Sunday. I can almost\nfancy Mrs Mason's workroom; and that, surely, is a proof either of\nthe strength of my imagination, or of your powers of description.\"\n\nRuth smiled. \"It is, indeed, sir. Our workroom must be so different\nto anything you ever saw. I think you must have passed through Milham\noften on your way to Lowford.\"\n\n\"Then you don't think it is any stretch of fancy to have so clear an\nidea as I have of Milham Grange? On the left hand of the road, is it,\nRuth?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, just over the bridge, and up the hill where the elm-trees\nmeet overhead and make a green shade; and then comes the dear old\nGrange, that I shall never see again.\"\n\n\"Never! Nonsense, Ruthie; it is only six miles off; you may see it\nany day. It is not an hour's ride.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I may see it again when I am grown old; I did not think\nexactly what 'never' meant; it is so very long since I was there, and\nI don't see any chance of my going for years and years, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Why, Ruth, you--we may go next Sunday afternoon, if you like.\"\n\nShe looked up at him with a lovely light of pleasure in her face at\nthe idea. \"How, sir? Can I walk it between afternoon service and the\ntime Mrs Mason comes home? I would go for only one glimpse; but if I\ncould get into the house--oh, sir! if I could just see mamma's room\nagain!\"\n\nHe was revolving plans in his head for giving her this pleasure, and\nhe had also his own in view. If they went in any of his carriages,\nthe loitering charm of the walk would be lost; and they must, to\na certain degree, be encumbered by, and exposed to, the notice of\nservants.\n\n\"Are you a good walker, Ruth? Do you think you can manage six miles?\nIf we set off at two o'clock, we shall be there by four, without\nhurrying; or say half-past four. Then we might stay two hours, and\nyou could show me all the old walks and old places you love, and we\ncould still come leisurely home. Oh, it's all arranged directly!\"\n\n\"But do you think it would be right, sir? It seems as if it would be\nsuch a great pleasure, that it must be in some way wrong.\"\n\n\"Why, you little goose, what can be wrong in it?\"\n\n\"In the first place, I miss going to church by setting out at two,\"\nsaid Ruth, a little gravely.\n\n\"Only for once. Surely you don't see any harm in missing church for\nonce? You will go in the morning, you know.\"\n\n\"I wonder if Mrs Mason would think it right--if she would allow it?\"\n\n\"No, I dare say not. But you don't mean to be governed by Mrs Mason's\nnotions of right and wrong. She thought it right to treat that poor\ngirl Palmer in the way you told me about. You would think that wrong,\nyou know, and so would every one of sense and feeling. Come, Ruth,\ndon't pin your faith on any one, but judge for yourself. The pleasure\nis perfectly innocent; it is not a selfish pleasure either, for I\nshall enjoy it to the full as much as you will. I shall like to see\nthe places where you spent your childhood; I shall almost love them\nas much as you do.\" He had dropped his voice; and spoke in low,\npersuasive tones. Ruth hung down her head, and blushed with exceeding\nhappiness; but she could not speak, even to urge her doubts afresh.\nThus it was in a manner settled.\n\nHow delightfully happy the plan made her through the coming week!\nShe was too young when her mother died to have received any cautions\nor words of advice respecting _the_ subject of a woman's life--if,\nindeed, wise parents ever directly speak of what, in its depth and\npower, cannot be put into words--which is a brooding spirit with no\ndefinite form or shape that men should know it, but which is there,\nand present before we have recognised and realised its existence.\nRuth was innocent and snow-pure. She had heard of falling in love,\nbut did not know the signs and symptoms thereof; nor, indeed, had\nshe troubled her head much about them. Sorrow had filled up her days,\nto the exclusion of all lighter thoughts than the consideration of\npresent duties, and the remembrance of the happy time which had been.\nBut the interval of blank, after the loss of her mother and during\nher father's life-in-death, had made her all the more ready to value\nand cling to sympathy--first from Jenny, and now from Mr Bellingham.\nTo see her home again, and to see it with him; to show him (secure\nof his interest) the haunts of former times, each with its little\ntale of the past--of dead and gone events!--No coming shadow threw\nits gloom over this week's dream of happiness--a dream which was too\nbright to be spoken about to common and indifferent ears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTreading in Perilous Places\n\n\nSunday came, as brilliant as if there were no sorrow, or death, or\nguilt in the world; a day or two of rain had made the earth fresh and\nbrave as the blue heavens above. Ruth thought it was too strong a\nrealisation of her hopes, and looked for an over-clouding at noon;\nbut the glory endured, and at two o'clock she was in the Leasowes,\nwith a beating heart full of joy, longing to stop the hours, which\nwould pass too quickly through the afternoon.\n\nThey sauntered through the fragrant lanes, as if their loitering\nwould prolong the time, and check the fiery-footed steeds galloping\napace towards the close of the happy day. It was past five o'clock\nbefore they came to the great mill-wheel, which stood in Sabbath\nidleness, motionless in a brown mass of shade, and still wet with\nyesterday's immersion in the deep transparent water beneath. They\nclambered the little hill, not yet fully shaded by the overarching\nelms; and then Ruth checked Mr Bellingham, by a slight motion of\nthe hand which lay within his arm, and glanced up into his face to\nsee what that face should express as it looked on Milham Grange,\nnow lying still and peaceful in its afternoon shadows. It was a\nhouse of after-thoughts; building materials were plentiful in the\nneighbourhood, and every successive owner had found a necessity\nfor some addition or projection, till it was a picturesque mass of\nirregularity--of broken light and shadow--which, as a whole, gave a\nfull and complete idea of a \"Home.\" All its gables and nooks were\nblended and held together by the tender green of the climbing roses\nand young creepers. An old couple were living in the house until it\nshould be let, but they dwelt in the back part, and never used the\nfront door; so the little birds had grown tame and familiar, and\nperched upon the window-sills and porch, and on the old stone cistern\nwhich caught the water from the roof.\n\nThey went silently through the untrimmed garden, full of the\npale-coloured flowers of spring. A spider had spread her web over\nthe front door. The sight of this conveyed a sense of desolation to\nRuth's heart; she thought it was possible the state entrance had\nnever been used since her father's dead body had been borne forth,\nand, without speaking a word, she turned abruptly away, and went\nround the house to another door. Mr Bellingham followed without\nquestioning, little understanding her feelings, but full of\nadmiration for the varying expression called out upon her face.\n\nThe old woman had not yet returned from church, or from the weekly\ngossip or neighbourly tea which succeeded. The husband sat in the\nkitchen, spelling the psalms for the day in his Prayer-book, and\nreading the words out aloud--a habit he had acquired from the double\nsolitude of his life, for he was deaf. He did not hear the quiet\nentrance of the pair, and they were struck with the sort of ghostly\necho which seems to haunt half-furnished and uninhabited houses. The\nverses he was reading were the following:\n\n\n   Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so\n   disquieted within me?\n\n   O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is\n   the help of my countenance, and my God.\n\n\nAnd when he had finished he shut the book, and sighed with the\nsatisfaction of having done his duty. The words of holy trust, though\nperhaps they were not fully understood, carried a faithful peace\ndown into the depths of his soul. As he looked up, he saw the young\ncouple standing on the middle of the floor. He pushed his iron-rimmed\nspectacles on to his forehead, and rose to greet the daughter of his\nold master and ever-honoured mistress.\n\n\"God bless thee, lass; God bless thee! My old eyes are glad to see\nthee again.\"\n\nRuth sprang forward to shake the horny hand stretched forward in\nthe action of blessing. She pressed it between both of hers, as\nshe rapidly poured out questions. Mr Bellingham was not altogether\ncomfortable at seeing one whom he had already begun to appropriate as\nhis own, so tenderly familiar with a hard-featured, meanly-dressed\nday-labourer. He sauntered to the window, and looked out into the\ngrass-grown farm-yard; but he could not help overhearing some of the\nconversation, which seemed to him carried on too much in the tone of\nequality. \"And who's yon?\" asked the old labourer at last. \"Is he\nyour sweetheart? Your missis's son, I reckon. He's a spruce young\nchap, anyhow.\"\n\nMr Bellingham's \"blood of all the Howards\" rose and tingled about\nhis ears, so that he could not hear Ruth's answer. It began by \"Hush,\nThomas; pray hush!\" but how it went on he did not catch. The idea of\nhis being Mrs Mason's son! It was really too ridiculous; but, like\nmost things which are \"too ridiculous,\" it made him very angry. He\nwas hardly himself again when Ruth shyly came to the window-recess\nand asked him if he would like to see the house-place, into which\nthe front door entered; many people thought it very pretty, she said,\nhalf timidly, for his face had unconsciously assumed a hard and\nhaughty expression, which he could not instantly soften down. He\nfollowed her, however; but before he left the kitchen he saw the old\nman standing, looking at Ruth's companion with a strange, grave air\nof dissatisfaction.\n\nThey went along one or two zigzag, damp-smelling stone passages, and\nthen entered the house-place, or common sitting-room for a farmer's\nfamily in that part of the country. The front door opened into it,\nand several other apartments issued out of it, such as the dairy,\nthe state bedroom (which was half-parlour as well), and a small room\nwhich had been appropriated to the late Mrs Hilton, where she sat,\nor more frequently lay, commanding through the open door the comings\nand goings of her household. In those days the house-place had been a\ncheerful room, full of life, with the passing to and fro of husband,\nchild, and servants; with a great merry wood fire crackling and\nblazing away every evening, and hardly let out in the very heat of\nsummer; for with the thick stone walls, and the deep window-seats,\nand the drapery of vine-leaves and ivy, that room, with its\nflag-floor, seemed always to want the sparkle and cheery warmth of a\nfire. But now the green shadows from without seemed to have become\nblack in the uninhabited desolation. The oaken shovel-board, the\nheavy dresser, and the carved cupboards, were now dull and damp,\nwhich were formerly polished up to the brightness of a looking-glass\nwhere the fire-blaze was for ever glinting; they only added to the\noppressive gloom; the flag-floor was wet with heavy moisture. Ruth\nstood gazing into the room, seeing nothing of what was present. She\nsaw a vision of former days--an evening in the days of her childhood;\nher father sitting in the \"master's corner\" near the fire, sedately\nsmoking his pipe, while he dreamily watched his wife and child; her\nmother reading to her, as she sat on a little stool at her feet. It\nwas gone--all gone into the land of shadows; but for the moment it\nseemed so present in the old room, that Ruth believed her actual life\nto be the dream. Then, still silent, she went on into her mother's\nparlour. But there, the bleak look of what had once been full of\npeace and mother's love, struck cold on her heart. She uttered a cry,\nand threw herself down by the sofa, hiding her face in her hands,\nwhile her frame quivered with her repressed sobs.\n\n\"Dearest Ruth, don't give way so. It can do no good; it cannot bring\nback the dead,\" said Mr Bellingham, distressed at witnessing her\ndistress.\n\n\"I know it cannot,\" murmured Ruth; \"and that is why I cry. I cry\nbecause nothing will ever bring them back again.\" She sobbed afresh,\nbut more gently, for his kind words soothed her, and softened, if\nthey could not take away, her sense of desolation.\n\n\"Come away; I cannot have you stay here, full of painful\nassociations as these rooms must be. Come\"--raising her with gentle\nviolence--\"show me your little garden you have often told me about.\nNear the window of this very room, is it not? See how well I remember\neverything you tell me.\"\n\nHe led her round through the back part of the house into the pretty\nold-fashioned garden. There was a sunny border just under the\nwindows, and clipped box and yew-trees by the grass-plat, further\naway from the house; and she prattled again of her childish\nadventures and solitary plays. When they turned round they saw the\nold man, who had hobbled out with the help of his stick, and was\nlooking at them with the same grave, sad look of anxiety.\n\nMr Bellingham spoke rather sharply:\n\n\"Why does that old man follow us about in that way? It is excessively\nimpertinent of him, I think.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't call old Thomas impertinent. He is so good and kind, he\nis like a father to me. I remember sitting on his knee many and many\na time when I was a child, whilst he told me stories out of the\n'Pilgrim's Progress.' He taught me to suck up milk through a straw.\nMamma was very fond of him too. He used to sit with us always in the\nevenings when papa was away at market, for mamma was rather afraid of\nhaving no man in the house, and used to beg old Thomas to stay; and\nhe would take me on his knee, and listen just as attentively as I did\nwhile mamma read aloud.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say you have sat upon that old fellow's knee?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! many and many a time.\"\n\nMr Bellingham looked graver than he had done while witnessing Ruth's\npassionate emotion in her mother's room. But he lost his sense of\nindignity in admiration of his companion as she wandered among the\nflowers, seeking for favourite bushes or plants, to which some\nhistory or remembrance was attached. She wound in and out in natural,\ngraceful, wavy lines between the luxuriant and overgrown shrubs,\nwhich were fragrant with a leafy smell of spring growth; she went on,\ncareless of watching eyes, indeed unconscious, for the time, of their\nexistence. Once she stopped to take hold of a spray of jessamine, and\nsoftly kiss it; it had been her mother's favourite flower.\n\nOld Thomas was standing by the horse-mount, and was also an observer\nof all her goings-on. But, while Mr Bellingham's feeling was that\nof passionate admiration mingled with a selfish kind of love, the\nold man gazed with tender anxiety, and his lips moved in words of\nblessing:\n\n\"She's a pretty creature, with a glint of her mother about her; and\nshe's the same kind lass as ever. Not a bit set up with yon fine\nmanty-maker's shop she's in. I misdoubt that young fellow though,\nfor all she called him a real gentleman, and checked me when I asked\nif he was her sweetheart. If his are not sweetheart's looks, I've\nforgotten all my young days. Here! they're going, I suppose. Look!\nhe wants her to go without a word to the old man; but she is none so\nchanged as that, I reckon.\"\n\nNot Ruth, indeed! She never perceived the dissatisfied expression of\nMr Bellingham's countenance, visible to the old man's keen eye; but\ncame running up to Thomas to send her love to his wife, and to shake\nhim many times by the hand.\n\n\"Tell Mary I'll make her such a fine gown, as soon as ever I set up\nfor myself; it shall be all in the fashion, big gigot sleeves, that\nshe shall not know herself in them! Mind you tell her that, Thomas,\nwill you?\"\n\n\"Aye, that I will, lass; and I reckon she'll be pleased to hear thou\nhast not forgotten thy old merry ways. The Lord bless thee--the Lord\nlift up the light of His countenance upon thee.\"\n\nRuth was half-way towards the impatient Mr Bellingham when her old\nfriend called her back. He longed to give her a warning of the\ndanger that he thought she was in, and yet he did not know how. When\nshe came up, all he could think of to say was a text; indeed, the\nlanguage of the Bible was the language in which he thought, whenever\nhis ideas went beyond practical everyday life into expressions of\nemotion or feeling. \"My dear, remember the devil goeth about as a\nroaring lion, seeking whom he may devour; remember that, Ruth.\"\n\nThe words fell on her ear, but gave no definite idea. The utmost they\nsuggested was the remembrance of the dread she felt as a child when\nthis verse came into her mind, and how she used to imagine a lion's\nhead with glaring eyes peering out of the bushes in a dark shady part\nof the wood, which, for this reason, she had always avoided, and even\nnow could hardly think of without a shudder. She never imagined that\nthe grim warning related to the handsome young man who awaited her\nwith a countenance beaming with love, and tenderly drew her hand\nwithin his arm.\n\nThe old man sighed as he watched them away. \"The Lord may help her\nto guide her steps aright. He may. But I'm afeard she's treading\nin perilous places. I'll put my missis up to going to the town and\ngetting speech of her, and telling her a bit of her danger. An old\nmotherly woman like our Mary will set about it better nor a stupid\nfellow like me.\"\n\nThe poor old labourer prayed long and earnestly that night for Ruth.\nHe called it \"wrestling for her soul;\" and I think his prayers were\nheard, for \"God judgeth not as man judgeth.\"\n\nRuth went on her way, all unconscious of the dark phantoms of the\nfuture that were gathering around her; her melancholy turned, with\nthe pliancy of childish years, at sixteen not yet lost, into a\nsoftened manner which was infinitely charming. By-and-by she cleared\nup into sunny happiness. The evening was still and full of mellow\nlight, and the new-born summer was so delicious that, in common with\nall young creatures, she shared its influence and was glad.\n\nThey stood together at the top of a steep ascent, \"the hill\" of the\nhundred. At the summit there was a level space, sixty or seventy\nyards square, of unenclosed and broken ground, over which the golden\nbloom of the gorse cast a rich hue, while its delicious scent\nperfumed the fresh and nimble air. On one side of this common, the\nground sloped down to a clear bright pond, in which were mirrored the\nrough sand-cliffs that rose abrupt on the opposite bank; hundreds\nof martens found a home there, and were now wheeling over the\ntransparent water, and dipping in their wings in their evening sport.\nIndeed, all sorts of birds seemed to haunt the lonely pool; the\nwater-wagtails were scattered around its margin, the linnets perched\non the topmost sprays of the gorse-bushes, and other hidden warblers\nsang their vespers on the uneven ground beyond. On the far side\nof the green waste, close by the road, and well placed for the\nrequirements of horses or their riders who might be weary with the\nascent of the hill, there was a public-house, which was more of a\nfarm than an inn. It was a long, low building, rich in dormer-windows\non the weather side, which were necessary in such an exposed\nsituation, and with odd projections and unlooked-for gables on every\nside; there was a deep porch in front, on whose hospitable benches\na dozen persons might sit and enjoy the balmy air. A noble sycamore\ngrew right before the house, with seats all round it (\"such tents\nthe patriarchs loved\"); and a nondescript sign hung from a branch\non the side next to the road, which, being wisely furnished with an\ninterpretation, was found to mean King Charles in the oak.\n\nNear this comfortable, quiet, unfrequented inn, there was another\npond, for household and farm-yard purposes, from which the cattle\nwere drinking, before returning to the fields after they had been\nmilked. Their very motions were so lazy and slow, that they served\nto fill up the mind with the sensation of dreamy rest. Ruth and Mr\nBellingham plunged through the broken ground to regain the road near\nthe wayside inn. Hand-in-hand, now pricked by the far-spreading\ngorse, now ankle-deep in sand; now pressing the soft, thick heath,\nwhich should make so brave an autumn show; and now over wild thyme\nand other fragrant herbs, they made their way, with many a merry\nlaugh. Once on the road, at the summit, Ruth stood silent, in\nbreathless delight at the view before her. The hill fell suddenly\ndown into the plain, extending for a dozen miles or more. There was\na clump of dark Scotch firs close to them, which cut clear against\nthe western sky, and threw back the nearest levels into distance.\nThe plain below them was richly wooded, and was tinted by the young\ntender hues of the earliest summer, for all the trees of the wood had\ndonned their leaves except the cautious ash, which here and there\ngave a soft, pleasant greyness to the landscape. Far away in the\nchampaign were spires, and towers, and stacks of chimneys belonging\nto some distant hidden farm-house, which were traced downwards\nthrough the golden air by the thin columns of blue smoke sent up from\nthe evening fires. The view was bounded by some rising ground in deep\npurple shadow against the sunset sky.\n\nWhen first they stopped, silent with sighing pleasure, the air seemed\nfull of pleasant noises; distant church-bells made harmonious music\nwith the little singing-birds near at hand; nor were the lowings of\nthe cattle, nor the calls of the farm-servants discordant, for the\nvoices seemed to be hushed by the brooding consciousness of the\nSabbath. They stood loitering before the house, quietly enjoying the\nview. The clock in the little inn struck eight, and it sounded clear\nand sharp in the stillness.\n\n\"Can it be so late?\" asked Ruth.\n\n\"I should not have thought it possible,\" answered Mr Bellingham.\n\"But, never mind, you will be at home long before nine. Stay, there\nis a shorter road, I know, through the fields; just wait a moment,\nwhile I go in and ask the exact way.\" He dropped Ruth's arm, and went\ninto the public-house.\n\nA gig had been slowly toiling up the sandy hill behind, unperceived\nby the young couple, and now it reached the table-land, and was close\nupon them as they separated. Ruth turned round, when the sound of the\nhorse's footsteps came distinctly as he reached the level. She faced\nMrs Mason!\n\nThey were not ten--no, not five yards apart. At the same moment they\nrecognised each other, and, what was worse, Mrs Mason had clearly\nseen, with her sharp, needle-like eyes, the attitude in which Ruth\nhad stood with the young man who had just quitted her. Ruth's hand\nhad been lying in his arm, and fondly held there by his other hand.\n\nMrs Mason was careless about the circumstances of temptation into\nwhich the girls entrusted to her as apprentices were thrown, but\nseverely intolerant if their conduct was in any degree influenced by\nthe force of these temptations. She called this intolerance \"keeping\nup the character of her establishment.\" It would have been a better\nand more Christian thing, if she had kept up the character of her\ngirls by tender vigilance and maternal care.\n\nThis evening, too, she was in an irritated state of temper. Her\nbrother had undertaken to drive her round by Henbury, in order to\ngive her the unpleasant information of the misbehaviour of her eldest\nson, who was an assistant in a draper's shop in a neighbouring town.\nShe was full of indignation against want of steadiness, though not\nwilling to direct her indignation against the right object--her\nne'er-do-well darling. While she was thus charged with anger (for\nher brother justly defended her son's master and companions from her\nattacks), she saw Ruth standing with a lover, far away from home,\nat such a time in the evening, and she boiled over with intemperate\ndispleasure.\n\n\"Come here directly, Miss Hilton,\" she exclaimed, sharply. Then,\ndropping her voice to low, bitter tones of concentrated wrath, she\nsaid to the trembling, guilty Ruth:\n\n\"Don't attempt to show your face at my house again after this\nconduct. I saw you, and your spark, too. I'll have no slurs on the\ncharacter of my apprentices. Don't say a word. I saw enough. I shall\nwrite and tell your guardian to-morrow.\"\n\nThe horse started away, for he was impatient to be off, and Ruth was\nleft standing there, stony, sick, and pale, as if the lightning had\ntorn up the ground beneath her feet. She could not go on standing,\nshe was so sick and faint; she staggered back to the broken\nsand-bank, and sank down, and covered her face with her hands.\n\n\"My dearest Ruth! are you ill? Speak, darling! My love, my love, do\nspeak to me!\"\n\nWhat tender words after such harsh ones! They loosened the fountain\nof Ruth's tears, and she cried bitterly.\n\n\"Oh! did you see her--did you hear what she said?\"\n\n\"She! Who, my darling? Don't sob so, Ruth; tell me what it is. Who\nhas been near you?--who has been speaking to you to make you cry so?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs Mason.\" And there was a fresh burst of sorrow.\n\n\"You don't say so! are you sure? I was not away five minutes.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir, I'm quite sure. She was so angry; she said I must\nnever show my face there again. Oh, dear! what shall I do?\"\n\nIt seemed to the poor child as if Mrs Mason's words were irrevocable,\nand, that being so, she was shut out from every house. She saw how\nmuch she had done that was deserving of blame, now when it was too\nlate to undo it. She knew with what severity and taunts Mrs Mason had\noften treated her for involuntary failings, of which she had been\nquite unconscious; and now she had really done wrong, and shrank\nwith terror from the consequences. Her eyes were so blinded by the\nfast-falling tears, she did not see (nor had she seen would she have\nbeen able to interpret) the change in Mr Bellingham's countenance, as\nhe stood silently watching her. He was silent so long, that even in\nher sorrow she began to wonder that he did not speak, and to wish to\nhear his soothing words once more.\n\n\"It is very unfortunate,\" he began, at last; and then he stopped;\nthen he began again: \"It is very unfortunate; for, you see, I did not\nlike to name it to you before, but, I believe--I have business, in\nfact, which obliges me to go to town to-morrow--to London, I mean;\nand I don't know when I shall be able to return.\"\n\n\"To London!\" cried Ruth; \"are you going away? Oh, Mr Bellingham!\" She\nwept afresh, giving herself up to the desolate feeling of sorrow,\nwhich absorbed all the terror she had been experiencing at the idea\nof Mrs Mason's anger. It seemed to her at this moment as though she\ncould have borne everything but his departure; but she did not speak\nagain; and after two or three minutes had elapsed, he spoke--not in\nhis natural careless voice, but in a sort of constrained, agitated\ntone.\n\n\"I can hardly bear the idea of leaving you, my own Ruth. In such\ndistress, too; for where you can go I do not know at all. From\nall you have told me of Mrs Mason, I don't think she is likely to\nmitigate her severity in your case.\"\n\nNo answer, but tears quietly, incessantly flowing. Mrs Mason's\ndispleasure seemed a distant thing; his going away was the present\ndistress. He went on:\n\n\"Ruth, would you go with me to London? My darling, I cannot leave\nyou here without a home; the thought of leaving you at all is pain\nenough, but in these circumstances--so friendless, so homeless--it is\nimpossible. You must come with me, love, and trust to me.\"\n\nStill she did not speak. Remember how young, and innocent, and\nmotherless she was! It seemed to her as if it would be happiness\nenough to be with him; and as for the future, he would arrange and\ndecide for that. The future lay wrapped in a golden mist, which she\ndid not care to penetrate; but if he, her sun, was out of sight and\ngone, the golden mist became dark heavy gloom, through which no hope\ncould come. He took her hand.\n\n\"Will you not come with me? Do you not love me enough to trust me?\nOh, Ruth,\" (reproachfully), \"can you not trust me?\"\n\nShe had stopped crying, but was sobbing sadly.\n\n\"I cannot bear this, love. Your sorrow is absolute pain to me; but it\nis worse to feel how indifferent you are--how little you care about\nour separation.\"\n\nHe dropped her hand. She burst into a fresh fit of crying.\n\n\"I may have to join my mother in Paris; I don't know when I shall see\nyou again. Oh, Ruth!\" said he, vehemently, \"do you love me at all?\"\n\nShe said something in a very low voice; he could not hear it, though\nhe bent down his head--but he took her hand again.\n\n\"What was it you said, love? Was it not that you did love me? My\ndarling, you do! I can tell it by the trembling of this little hand;\nthen you will not suffer me to go away alone and unhappy, most\nanxious about you? There is no other course open to you; my poor girl\nhas no friends to receive her. I will go home directly, and return\nin an hour with a carriage. You make me too happy by your silence,\nRuth.\"\n\n\"Oh, what can I do!\" exclaimed Ruth. \"Mr Bellingham, you should help\nme, and instead of that you only bewilder me.\"\n\n\"How, my dearest Ruth? Bewilder you! It seems so clear to me. Look\nat the case fairly! Here you are, an orphan, with only one person\nto love you, poor child!--thrown off, for no fault of yours, by the\nonly creature on whom you have a claim, that creature a tyrannical,\ninflexible woman; what is more natural (and, being natural, more\nright) than that you should throw yourself upon the care of the\none who loves you dearly--who would go through fire and water for\nyou--who would shelter you from all harm? Unless, indeed, as I\nsuspect, you do not care for him. If so, Ruth! if you do not care for\nme, we had better part--I will leave you at once; it will be better\nfor me to go, if you do not care for me.\"\n\nHe said this very sadly (it seemed so to Ruth, at least), and made as\nthough he would have drawn his hand from hers, but now she held it\nwith soft force.\n\n\"Don't leave me, please, sir. It is very true I have no friend but\nyou. Don't leave me, please. But, oh! do tell me what I must do!\"\n\n\"Will you do it if I tell you? If you will trust me, I will do my\nvery best for you. I will give you my best advice. You see your\nposition. Mrs Mason writes and gives her own exaggerated account to\nyour guardian; he is bound by no great love to you, from what I have\nheard you say, and throws you off; I, who might be able to befriend\nyou--through my mother, perhaps--I, who could at least comfort you\na little (could not I, Ruth?), am away, far away, for an indefinite\ntime; that is your position at present. Now, what I advise is this.\nCome with me into this little inn; I will order tea for you--(I am\nsure you require it sadly)--and I will leave you there, and go home\nfor the carriage. I will return in an hour at the latest. Then we\nare together, come what may; that is enough for me; is it not for\nyou, Ruth? Say, yes--say it ever so low, but give me the delight of\nhearing it. Ruth, say yes.\"\n\nLow and soft, with much hesitation, came the \"Yes;\" the fatal word of\nwhich she so little imagined the infinite consequences. The thought\nof being with him was all and everything.\n\n\"How you tremble, my darling! You are cold, love! Come into the\nhouse, and I'll order tea directly and be off.\"\n\nShe rose, and, leaning on his arm, went into the house. She was\nshaking and dizzy with the agitation of the last hour. He spoke to\nthe civil farmer-landlord, who conducted them into a neat parlour,\nwith windows opening into the garden at the back of the house. They\nhad admitted much of the evening's fragrance through their open\ncasements, before they were hastily closed by the attentive host.\n\n\"Tea, directly, for this lady!\" The landlord vanished.\n\n\"Dearest Ruth, I must go; there is not an instant to be lost; promise\nme to take some tea, for you are shivering all over, and deadly pale\nwith the fright that abominable woman has given you. I must go; I\nshall be back in half an hour--and then no more partings, darling.\"\n\nHe kissed her pale cold face, and went away. The room whirled round\nbefore Ruth; it was a dream--a strange, varying, shifting dream--with\nthe old home of her childhood for one scene, with the terror of Mrs\nMason's unexpected appearance for another; and then, strangest,\ndizziest, happiest of all, there was the consciousness of his love,\nwho was all the world to her; and the remembrance of the tender\nwords, which still kept up their low soft echo in her heart.\n\nHer head ached so much that she could hardly see; even the dusky\ntwilight was a dazzling glare to her poor eyes; and when the daughter\nof the house brought in the sharp light of the candles, preparatory\nfor tea, Ruth hid her face in the sofa pillows with a low exclamation\nof pain.\n\n\"Does your head ache, miss?\" asked the girl, in a gentle,\nsympathising voice. \"Let me make you some tea, miss, it will do you\ngood. Many's the time poor mother's headaches were cured by good\nstrong tea.\"\n\nRuth murmured acquiescence; the young girl (about Ruth's own age,\nbut who was the mistress of the little establishment, owing to her\nmother's death) made tea, and brought Ruth a cup to the sofa where\nshe lay. Ruth was feverish and thirsty, and eagerly drank it off,\nalthough she could not touch the bread and butter which the girl\noffered her. She felt better and fresher, though she was still faint\nand weak.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Ruth. \"Don't let me keep you; perhaps you are busy.\nYou have been very kind, and the tea has done me a great deal of\ngood.\"\n\nThe girl left the room. Ruth became as hot as she had previously been\ncold, and went and opened the window, and leant out into the still,\nsweet, evening air. The bush of sweetbrier, underneath the window,\nscented the place, and the delicious fragrance reminded her of her\nold home. I think scents affect and quicken the memory more than\neither sights or sounds; for Ruth had instantly before her eyes the\nlittle garden beneath the window of her mother's room, with the old\nman leaning on his stick, watching her, just as he had done, not\nthree hours before, on that very afternoon.\n\n\"Dear old Thomas! He and Mary would take me in, I think; they would\nlove me all the more if I were cast off. And Mr Bellingham would,\nperhaps, not be so very long away; and he would know where to find\nme if I stayed at Milham Grange. Oh, would it not be better to go to\nthem? I wonder if he would be very sorry! I could not bear to make\nhim sorry, so kind as he has been to me; but I do believe it would\nbe better to go to them, and ask their advice, at any rate. He would\nfollow me there; and I could talk over what I had better do, with the\nthree best friends I have in the world--the only friends I have.\"\n\nShe put on her bonnet, and opened the parlour-door; but then she saw\nthe square figure of the landlord standing at the open house-door,\nsmoking his evening pipe, and looming large and distinct against the\ndark air and landscape beyond. Ruth remembered the cup of tea that\nshe had drank; it must be paid for, and she had no money with her.\nShe feared that he would not let her quit the house without paying.\nShe thought that she would leave a note for Mr Bellingham, saying\nwhere she was gone, and how she had left the house in debt, for\n(like a child) all dilemmas appeared of equal magnitude to her; and\nthe difficulty of passing the landlord while he stood there, and\nof giving him an explanation of the circumstances (as far as such\nexplanation was due to him), appeared insuperable, and as awkward,\nand fraught with inconvenience, as far more serious situations.\nShe kept peeping out of her room, after she had written her little\npencil-note, to see if the outer door was still obstructed. There\nhe stood, motionless, enjoying his pipe, and looking out into the\ndarkness which gathered thick with the coming night. The fumes of\nthe tobacco were carried by the air into the house, and brought back\nRuth's sick headache. Her energy left her; she became stupid and\nlanguid, and incapable of spirited exertion; she modified her plan\nof action, to the determination of asking Mr Bellingham to take her\nto Milham Grange, to the care of her humble friends, instead of to\nLondon. And she thought, in her simplicity, that he would instantly\nconsent when he had heard her reasons.\n\nShe started up. A carriage dashed up to the door. She hushed her\nbeating heart, and tried to stop her throbbing head to listen. She\nheard him speaking to the landlord, though she could not distinguish\nwhat he said; heard the jingling of money, and, in another moment, he\nwas in the room, and had taken her arm to lead her to the carriage.\n\n\"Oh, sir! I want you to take me to Milham Grange,\" said she, holding\nback. \"Old Thomas would give me a home.\"\n\n\"Well, dearest, we'll talk of all that in the carriage; I am sure\nyou will listen to reason. Nay, if you will go to Milham you must go\nin the carriage,\" said he, hurriedly. She was little accustomed to\noppose the wishes of any one--obedient and docile by nature, and\nunsuspicious and innocent of any harmful consequences. She entered\nthe carriage, and drove towards London.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nIn North Wales\n\n\nThe June of 18-- had been glorious and sunny, and full of flowers;\nbut July came in with pouring rain, and it was a gloomy time for\ntravellers and for weather-bound tourists, who lounged away the days\nin touching up sketches, dressing flies, and reading over again for\nthe twentieth time the few volumes they had brought with them. A\nnumber of the _Times_, five days old, had been in constant demand in\nall the sitting-rooms of a certain inn in a little mountain village\nof North Wales, through a long July morning. The valleys around were\nfilled with thick cold mist, which had crept up the hillsides till\nthe hamlet itself was folded in its white dense curtain, and from the\ninn-windows nothing was seen of the beautiful scenery around. The\ntourists who thronged the rooms might as well have been \"wi' their\ndear little bairnies at hame;\" and so some of them seemed to think,\nas they stood, with their faces flattened against the window-panes,\nlooking abroad in search of an event to fill up the dreary time.\nHow many dinners were hastened that day, by way of getting through\nthe morning, let the poor Welsh kitchen-maid say! The very village\nchildren kept indoors; or if one or two more adventurous stole out\ninto the land of temptation and puddles, they were soon clutched back\nby angry and busy mothers.\n\nIt was only four o'clock, but most of the inmates of the inn thought\nit must be between six and seven, the morning had seemed so long--so\nmany hours had passed since dinner--when a Welsh car, drawn by two\nhorses, rattled briskly up to the door. Every window of the ark was\ncrowded with faces at the sound; the leathern curtains were undrawn\nto their curious eyes, and out sprang a gentleman, who carefully\nassisted a well-cloaked-up lady into the little inn, despite the\nlandlady's assurances of not having a room to spare.\n\nThe gentleman (it was Mr Bellingham) paid no attention to the\nspeeches of the hostess, but quietly superintended the unpacking of\nthe carriage, and paid the postillion; then, turning round with his\nface to the light, he spoke to the landlady, whose voice had been\nrising during the last five minutes:\n\n\"Nay, Jenny, you're strangely altered, if you can turn out an old\nfriend on such an evening as this. If I remember right, Pen tr\u00c3\u00aa\nVoelas is twenty miles across the bleakest mountain road I ever saw.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir, and I did not know you; Mr Bellingham, I believe.\nIndeed, sir, Pen tr\u00c3\u00aa Voelas is not above eighteen miles--we only\ncharge for eighteen; it may not be much above seventeen; and we're\nquite full, indeed, more's the pity.\"\n\n\"Well, but Jenny, to oblige me, an old friend, you can find lodgings\nout for some of your people--the house across, for instance.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir, and it's at liberty; perhaps you would not mind lodging\nthere yourself; I could get you the best rooms, and send over a\ntrifle or so of furniture, if they wern't as you'd wish them to be.\"\n\n\"No, Jenny! here I stay. You'll not induce me to venture over into\nthose rooms, whose dirt I know of old. Can't you persuade some one\nwho is not an old friend to move across? Say, if you like, that I had\nwritten beforehand to bespeak the rooms. Oh! I know you can manage\nit--I know your good-natured ways.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir--well! I'll see, if you and the lady will just step into\nthe back parlour, sir--there's no one there just now; the lady is\nkeeping her bed to-day for a cold, and the gentleman is having a\nrubber at whist in number three. I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\"Thank you, thank you. Is there a fire? if not, one must be lighted.\nCome, Ruthie, come.\"\n\nHe led the way into a large, bow-windowed room, which looked gloomy\nenough that afternoon, but which I have seen bright and buoyant with\nyouth and hope within, and sunny lights creeping down the purple\nmountain slope, and stealing over the green, soft meadows, till they\nreached the little garden, full of roses and lavender-bushes, lying\nclose under the window. I have seen--but I shall see no more.\n\n\"I did not know you had been here before,\" said Ruth, as Mr\nBellingham helped her off with her cloak.\n\n\"Oh, yes; three years ago I was here on a reading party. We were here\nabove two months, attracted by Jenny's kind heart and oddities; but\ndriven away finally by the insufferable dirt. However, for a week or\ntwo it won't much signify.\"\n\n\"But can she take us in, sir? I thought I heard her saying her house\nwas full.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--I dare say it is; but I shall pay her well; she can easily\nmake excuses to some poor devil, and send him over to the other side;\nand, for a day or two, so that we have shelter, it does not much\nsignify.\"\n\n\"Could not we go to the house on the other side, sir?\"\n\n\"And have our meals carried across to us in a half-warm state, to say\nnothing of having no one to scold for bad cooking! You don't know\nthese out-of-the-way Welsh inns yet, Ruthie.\"\n\n\"No! I only thought it seemed rather unfair--\" said Ruth, gently; but\nshe did not end her sentence, for Mr Bellingham formed his lips into\na whistle, and walked to the window to survey the rain.\n\nThe remembrance of his former good payment prompted many little lies\nof which Mrs Morgan was guilty that afternoon, before she succeeded\nin turning out a gentleman and lady, who were only planning to remain\ntill the ensuing Saturday at the outside, so, if they did fulfil\ntheir threat, and leave on the next day, she would be no very great\nloser.\n\nThese household arrangements complete, she solaced herself with tea\nin her own little parlour, and shrewdly reviewed the circumstances of\nMr Bellingham's arrival.\n\n\"Indeed! and she's not his wife,\" thought Jenny, \"that's clear as\nday. His wife would have brought her maid, and given herself twice as\nmany airs about the sitting-rooms; while this poor miss never spoke,\nbut kept as still as a mouse. Indeed, and young men will be young\nmen; and, as long as their fathers and mothers shut their eyes, it's\nnone of my business to go about asking questions.\"\n\nIn this manner they settled down to a week's enjoyment of that Alpine\ncountry. It was most true enjoyment to Ruth. It was opening a new\nsense; vast ideas of beauty and grandeur filled her mind at the sight\nof the mountains now first beheld in full majesty. She was almost\noverpowered by the vague and solemn delight; but by-and-by her love\nfor them equalled her awe, and in the night-time she would softly\nrise, and steal to the window to see the white moonlight, which gave\na new aspect to the everlasting hills that girdle the mountain\nvillage.\n\nTheir breakfast-hour was late, in accordance with Mr Bellingham's\ntastes and habits; but Ruth was up betimes, and out and away,\nbrushing the dew-drops from the short crisp grass; the lark sung high\nabove her head, and she knew not if she moved or stood still, for the\ngrandeur of this beautiful earth absorbed all idea of separate and\nindividual existence. Even rain was a pleasure to her. She sat in the\nwindow-seat of their parlour (she would have gone out gladly, but\nthat such a proceeding annoyed Mr Bellingham, who usually at such\ntimes lounged away the listless hours on a sofa, and relieved himself\nby abusing the weather); she saw the swift-fleeting showers come\nathwart the sunlight like a rush of silver arrows; she watched the\npurple darkness on the heathery mountain-side, and then the pale\ngolden gleam which succeeded. There was no change or alteration of\nnature that had not its own peculiar beauty in the eyes of Ruth;\nbut if she had complained of the changeable climate, she would have\npleased Mr Bellingham more; her admiration and her content made him\nangry, until her pretty motions and loving eyes soothed down his\nimpatience.\n\n\"Really, Ruth,\" he exclaimed one day, when they had been imprisoned\nby rain a whole morning, \"one would think you had never seen a shower\nof rain before; it quite wearies me to see you sitting there watching\nthis detestable weather with such a placid countenance; and for the\nlast two hours you have said nothing more amusing or interesting\nthan--'Oh, how beautiful!' or, 'There's another cloud coming across\nMoel Wynn.'\"\n\nRuth left her seat very gently, and took up her work. She wished she\nhad the gift of being amusing; it must be dull for a man accustomed\nto all kinds of active employments to be shut up in the house. She\nwas recalled from her absolute self-forgetfulness. What could she say\nto interest Mr Bellingham? While she thought, he spoke again:\n\n\"I remember when we were reading here three years ago, we had a week\nof just such weather as this; but Howard and Johnson were capital\nwhist players, and Wilbraham not bad, so we got through the days\nfamously. Can you play _\u00c3\u00a9cart\u00c3\u00a9_, Ruth, or picquet?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I have sometimes played at beggar-my-neighbour,\" answered\nRuth, humbly, regretting her own deficiencies.\n\nHe murmured impatiently, and there was silence for another half-hour.\nThen he sprang up, and rung the bell violently. \"Ask Mrs Morgan for a\npack of cards. Ruthie, I'll teach you _\u00c3\u00a9cart\u00c3\u00a9_,\" said he.\n\nBut Ruth was stupid, not so good as a dummy, he said; and it was\nno fun betting against himself. So the cards were flung across the\ntable--on the floor--anywhere. Ruth picked them up. As she rose, she\nsighed a little with the depression of spirits consequent upon her\nown want of power to amuse and occupy him she loved.\n\n\"You're pale, love!\" said he, half repenting of his anger at her\nblunders over the cards. \"Go out before dinner; you know you don't\nmind this cursed weather; and see that you come home full of\nadventures to relate. Come, little blockhead! give me a kiss, and\nbegone.\"\n\nShe left the room with a feeling of relief; for if he were dull\nwithout her, she should not feel responsible, and unhappy at her own\nstupidity. The open air, that kind soothing balm which gentle mother\nNature offers to us all in our seasons of depression, relieved her.\nThe rain had ceased, though every leaf and blade was loaded with\ntrembling glittering drops. Ruth went down to the circular dale, into\nwhich the brown-foaming mountain river fell and made a deep pool,\nand, after resting there for a while, ran on between broken rocks\ndown to the valley below. The waterfall was magnificent, as she had\nanticipated; she longed to extend her walk to the other side of the\nstream, so she sought the stepping-stones, the usual crossing-place,\nwhich were over-shadowed by trees, a few yards from the pool. The\nwaters ran high and rapidly, as busy as life, between the pieces of\ngrey rock; but Ruth had no fear, and went lightly and steadily on.\nAbout the middle, however, there was a great gap; either one of the\nstones was so covered with water as to be invisible, or it had been\nwashed lower down; at any rate, the spring from stone to stone was\nlong, and Ruth hesitated for a moment before taking it. The sound of\nrushing waters was in her ears to the exclusion of every other noise;\nher eyes were on the current running swiftly below her feet; and\nthus she was startled to see a figure close before her on one of the\nstones, and to hear a voice offering help.\n\nShe looked up and saw a man, who was apparently long past middle\nlife, and of the stature of a dwarf; a second glance accounted for\nthe low height of the speaker, for then she saw he was deformed. As\nthe consciousness of this infirmity came into her mind, it must have\ntold itself in her softened eyes, for a faint flush of colour came\ninto the pale face of the deformed gentleman, as he repeated his\nwords:\n\n\"The water is very rapid; will you take my hand? Perhaps I can help\nyou.\"\n\nRuth accepted the offer, and with this assistance she was across in\na moment. He made way for her to precede him in the narrow wood path,\nand then silently followed her up the glen.\n\nWhen they had passed out of the wood into the pasture-land beyond,\nRuth once more turned to mark him. She was struck afresh with\nthe mild beauty of the face, though there was something in the\ncountenance which told of the body's deformity, something more and\nbeyond the pallor of habitual ill-health, something of a quick\nspiritual light in the deep set-eyes, a sensibility about the mouth;\nbut altogether, though a peculiar, it was a most attractive face.\n\n\"Will you allow me to accompany you if you are going the round by\nCwm Dhu, as I imagine you are? The hand-rail is blown away from the\nlittle wooden bridge by the storm last night, and the rush of waters\nbelow may make you dizzy; and it is really dangerous to fall there,\nthe stream is so deep.\"\n\nThey walked on without much speech. She wondered who her companion\nmight be. She should have known him, if she had seen him among the\nstrangers at the inn; and yet he spoke English too well to be a\nWelshman; he knew the country and the paths so perfectly, he must\nbe a resident; and so she tossed him from England to Wales and back\nagain in her imagination.\n\n\"I only came here yesterday,\" said he, as a widening in the path\npermitted them to walk abreast. \"Last night I went to the higher\nwaterfalls; they are most splendid.\"\n\n\"Did you go out in all that rain?\" asked Ruth, timidly.\n\n\"Oh, yes. Rain never hinders me from walking. Indeed, it gives a new\nbeauty to such a country as this. Besides, my time for my excursion\nis so short, I cannot afford to waste a day.\"\n\n\"Then, you do not live here?\" asked Ruth.\n\n\"No! my home is in a very different place. I live in a busy town,\nwhere at times it is difficult to feel the truth that\n\n\n   There are in this loud stunning tide\n      Of human care and crime,\n   With whom the melodies abide\n      Of th' everlasting chime;\n   Who carry music in their heart\n   Through dusky lane and crowded mart,\n   Plying their task with busier feet,\n   Because their secret souls a holy strain repeat.\n\n\nI have an annual holiday, which I generally spend in Wales; and often\nin this immediate neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"I do not wonder at your choice,\" replied Ruth. \"It is a beautiful\ncountry.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed; and I have been inoculated by an old innkeeper at\nConway with a love for its people, and history, and traditions. I\nhave picked up enough of the language to understand many of their\nlegends; and some are very fine and awe-inspiring, others very poetic\nand fanciful.\"\n\nRuth was too shy to keep up the conversation by any remark of her\nown, although his gentle, pensive manner was very winning.\n\n\"For instance,\" said he, touching a long bud-laden stem of fox-glove\nin the hedge-side, at the bottom of which one or two crimson-speckled\nflowers were bursting from their green sheaths, \"I dare say, you\ndon't know what makes this fox-glove bend and sway so gracefully. You\nthink it is blown by the wind, don't you?\" He looked at her with a\ngrave smile, which did not enliven his thoughtful eyes, but gave an\ninexpressible sweetness to his face.\n\n\"I always thought it was the wind. What is it?\" asked Ruth,\ninnocently.\n\n\"Oh, the Welsh tell you that this flower is sacred to the fairies,\nand that it has the power of recognising them, and all spiritual\nbeings who pass by, and that it bows in deference to them as they\nwaft along. Its Welsh name is Maneg Ellyllyn--the good people's\nglove; and hence, I imagine, our folk's-glove or fox-glove.\"\n\n\"It's a very pretty fancy,\" said Ruth, much interested, and wishing\nthat he would go on, without expecting her to reply.\n\nBut they were already at the wooden bridge; he led her across, and\nthen, bowing his adieu, he had taken a different path even before\nRuth had thanked him for his attention.\n\nIt was an adventure to tell Mr Bellingham, however; and it roused and\namused him till dinner-time came, after which he sauntered forth with\na cigar.\n\n\"Ruth,\" said he, when he returned, \"I've seen your little hunchback.\nHe looks like Riquet-with-the-Tuft. He's not a gentleman, though. If\nit had not been for his deformity, I should not have made him out\nfrom your description; you called him a gentleman.\"\n\n\"And don't you, sir?\" asked Ruth, surprised.\n\n\"Oh, no! he's regularly shabby and seedy in his appearance; lodging,\ntoo, the ostler told me, over that horrible candle and cheese shop,\nthe smell of which is insufferable twenty yards off--no gentleman\ncould endure it; he must be a traveller or artist, or something of\nthat kind.\"\n\n\"Did you see his face, sir?\" asked Ruth.\n\n\"No; but a man's back--his _tout ensemble_ has character enough in it\nto decide his rank.\"\n\n\"His face was very singular; quite beautiful!\" said she, softly; but\nthe subject did not interest Mr Bellingham, and he let it drop.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTroubles Gather About Ruth\n\n\nThe next day the weather was brave and glorious; a perfect \"bridal\nof the earth and sky;\" and every one turned out of the inn to enjoy\nthe fresh beauty of nature. Ruth was quite unconscious of being the\nobject of remark, and, in her light, rapid passings to and fro, had\nnever looked at the doors and windows, where many watchers stood\nobserving her, and commenting upon her situation or her appearance.\n\n\"She's a very lovely creature,\" said one gentleman, rising from the\nbreakfast-table to catch a glimpse of her as she entered from her\nmorning's ramble. \"Not above sixteen, I should think. Very modest and\ninnocent-looking in her white gown!\"\n\nHis wife, busy administering to the wants of a fine little boy, could\nonly say (without seeing the young girl's modest ways, and gentle,\ndowncast countenance):\n\n\"Well! I do think it's a shame such people should be allowed to come\nhere. To think of such wickedness under the same roof! Do come away,\nmy dear, and don't flatter her by such notice.\"\n\nThe husband returned to the breakfast-table; he smelt the broiled\nham and eggs, and he heard his wife's commands. Whether smelling\nor hearing had most to do in causing his obedience, I cannot tell;\nperhaps you can.\n\n\"Now, Harry, go and see if nurse and baby are ready to go out with\nyou. You must lose no time this beautiful morning.\"\n\nRuth found Mr Bellingham was not yet come down; so she sallied out\nfor an additional half-hour's ramble. Flitting about through the\nvillage, trying to catch all the beautiful sunny peeps at the scenery\nbetween the cold stone houses, which threw the radiant distance into\na\u00c3\u00abrial perspective far away, she passed by the little shop; and, just\nissuing from it, came the nurse and baby, and little boy. The baby\nsat in placid dignity in her nurse's arms, with a face of queenly\ncalm. Her fresh, soft, peachy complexion was really tempting; and\nRuth, who was always fond of children, went up to coo and to smile\nat the little thing, and, after some \"peep-boing,\" she was about to\nsnatch a kiss, when Harry, whose face had been reddening ever since\nthe play began, lifted up his sturdy little right arm and hit Ruth a\ngreat blow on the face.\n\n\"Oh, for shame, sir!\" said the nurse, snatching back his hand; \"how\ndare you do that to the lady who is so kind as to speak to Sissy.\"\n\n\"She's not a lady!\" said he, indignantly. \"She's a bad naughty\ngirl--mamma said so, she did; and she shan't kiss our baby.\"\n\nThe nurse reddened in her turn. She knew what he must have heard;\nbut it was awkward to bring it out, standing face to face with the\nelegant young lady.\n\n\"Children pick up such notions, ma'am,\" said she at last,\napologetically, to Ruth, who stood, white and still, with a new idea\nrunning through her mind.\n\n\"It's no notion; it's true, nurse; and I heard you say it yourself.\nGo away, naughty woman!\" said the boy, in infantile vehemence of\npassion to Ruth.\n\nTo the nurse's infinite relief, Ruth turned away, humbly and meekly,\nwith bent head, and slow, uncertain steps. But as she turned, she saw\nthe mild sad face of the deformed gentleman, who was sitting at the\nopen window above the shop; he looked sadder and graver than ever;\nand his eyes met her glance with an expression of deep sorrow. And\nso, condemned alike by youth and age, she stole with timid step into\nthe house. Mr Bellingham was awaiting her coming in the sitting-room.\nThe glorious day restored all his buoyancy of spirits. He talked\ngaily away, without pausing for a reply; while Ruth made tea, and\ntried to calm her heart, which was yet beating with the agitation of\nthe new ideas she had received from the occurrence of the morning.\nLuckily for her, the only answers required for some time were\nmono-syllables; but those few words were uttered in so depressed and\nmournful a tone, that at last they struck Mr Bellingham with surprise\nand displeasure, as the condition of mind they unconsciously implied\ndid not harmonise with his own.\n\n\"Ruth, what is the matter this morning? You really are very\nprovoking. Yesterday, when everything was gloomy, and you might have\nbeen aware that I was out of spirits, I heard nothing but expressions\nof delight; to-day, when every creature under heaven is rejoicing,\nyou look most deplorable and woe-begone. You really should learn to\nhave a little sympathy.\"\n\nThe tears fell quickly down Ruth's cheeks, but she did not speak.\nShe could not put into words the sense she was just beginning to\nentertain of the estimation in which she was henceforward to be held.\nShe thought he would be as much grieved as she was at what had taken\nplace that morning; she fancied she should sink in his opinion if she\ntold him how others regarded her; besides, it seemed ungenerous to\ndilate upon the suffering of which he was the cause.\n\n\"I will not,\" thought she, \"embitter his life; I will try and be\ncheerful. I must not think of myself so much. If I can but make him\nhappy, what need I care for chance speeches?\"\n\nAccordingly, she made every effort possible to be as light-hearted as\nhe was; but, somehow, the moment she relaxed, thoughts would intrude,\nand wonders would force themselves upon her mind; so that altogether\nshe was not the gay and bewitching companion Mr Bellingham had\npreviously found her.\n\nThey sauntered out for a walk. The path they chose led to a wood on\nthe side of a hill, and they entered, glad of the shade of the trees.\nAt first, it appeared like any common grove, but they soon came to a\ndeep descent, on the summit of which they stood, looking down on the\ntree-tops, which were softly waving far beneath their feet. There was\na path leading sharp down, and they followed it; the ledge of rock\nmade it almost like going down steps, and their walk grew into a\nbounding, and their bounding into a run, before they reached the\nlowest plane. A green gloom reigned there; it was the still hour of\nnoon; the little birds were quiet in some leafy shade. They went on a\nfew yards, and then they came to a circular pool overshadowed by the\ntrees, whose highest boughs had been beneath their feet a few minutes\nbefore. The pond was hardly below the surface of the ground, and\nthere was nothing like a bank on any side. A heron was standing there\nmotionless, but when he saw them he flapped his wings and slowly\nrose, and soared above the green heights of the wood up into the very\nsky itself, for at that depth the trees appeared to touch the round\nwhite clouds which brooded over the earth. The speed-well grew in\nthe shallowest water of the pool, and all around its margin, but the\nflowers were hardly seen at first, so deep was the green shadow cast\nby the trees. In the very middle of the pond the sky was mirrored\nclear and dark, a blue which looked as if a black void lay behind.\n\n\"Oh, there are water-lilies,\" said Ruth, her eye catching on the\nfarther side. \"I must go and get some.\"\n\n\"No; I will get them for you. The ground is spongy all round there.\nSit still, Ruth; this heap of grass will make a capital seat.\"\n\nHe went round, and she waited quietly for his return. When he came\nback he took off her bonnet, without speaking, and began to place\nhis flowers in her hair. She was quite still while he arranged her\ncoronet, looking up in his face with loving eyes, with a peaceful\ncomposure. She knew that he was pleased from his manner, which had\nthe joyousness of a child playing with a new toy, and she did not\nthink twice of his occupation. It was pleasant to forget everything\nexcept his pleasure. When he had decked her out, he said:\n\n\"There, Ruth! now you'll do. Come and look at yourself in the pond.\nHere, where there are no weeds. Come.\"\n\nShe obeyed, and could not help seeing her own loveliness; it gave\nher a sense of satisfaction for an instant, as the sight of any\nother beautiful object would have done, but she never thought of\nassociating it with herself. She knew that she was beautiful; but\nthat seemed abstract, and removed from herself. Her existence was in\nfeeling, and thinking, and loving.\n\nDown in that green hollow they were quite in harmony. Her beauty was\nall that Mr Bellingham cared for, and it was supreme. It was all he\nrecognised of her, and he was proud of it. She stood in her white\ndress against the trees which grew around; her face was flushed into\na brilliancy of colour which resembled that of a rose in June; the\ngreat heavy white flowers drooped on either side of her beautiful\nhead, and if her brown hair was a little disordered, the very\ndisorder only seemed to add a grace. She pleased him more by looking\nso lovely than by all her tender endeavours to fall in with his\nvarying humour.\n\nBut when they left the wood, and Ruth had taken out her flowers, and\nresumed her bonnet, as they came near the inn, the simple thought of\ngiving him pleasure was not enough to secure Ruth's peace. She became\npensive and sad, and could not rally into gaiety.\n\n\"Really, Ruth,\" said he, that evening, \"you must not encourage\nyourself in this habit of falling into melancholy reveries without\nany cause. You have been sighing twenty times during the last\nhalf-hour. Do be a little cheerful. Remember, I have no companion but\nyou in this out-of-the-way place.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry, sir,\" said Ruth, her eyes filling with tears; and\nthen she remembered that it was very dull for him to be alone with\nher, heavy-hearted as she had been all day. She said in a sweet,\npenitent tone:\n\n\"Would you be so kind as to teach me one of those games at cards you\nwere speaking about yesterday, sir? I would do my best to learn.\"\n\nHer soft, murmuring voice won its way. They rang for the cards, and\nhe soon forgot that there was such a thing as depression or gloom in\nthe world, in the pleasure of teaching such a beautiful ignoramus the\nmysteries of card-playing.\n\n\"There!\" said he, at last, \"that's enough for one lesson. Do you\nknow, little goose, your blunders have made me laugh myself into one\nof the worst headaches I have had for years.\"\n\nHe threw himself on the sofa, and in an instant she was by his side.\n\n\"Let me put my cool hands on your forehead,\" she begged; \"that used\nto do mamma good.\"\n\nHe lay still, his face away from the light, and not speaking.\nPresently he fell asleep. Ruth put out the candles, and sat patiently\nby him for a long time, fancying he would awaken refreshed. The room\ngrew cool in the night air; but Ruth dared not rouse him from what\nappeared to be sound, restoring slumber. She covered him with her\nshawl, which she had thrown over a chair on coming in from their\ntwilight ramble. She had ample time to think; but she tried to banish\nthought. At last, his breathing became quick and oppressed, and,\nafter listening to it for some minutes with increasing affright, Ruth\nventured to waken him. He seemed stupified and shivery. Ruth became\nmore and more terrified; all the household were asleep except one\nservant-girl, who was wearied out of what little English she had\nknowledge of in more waking hours, and she could only answer, \"Iss,\nindeed, ma'am,\" to any question put to her by Ruth.\n\nShe sat by the bedside all night long. He moaned and tossed, but\nnever spoke sensibly. It was a new form of illness to the miserable\nRuth. Her yesterday's suffering went into the black distance of\nlong-past years. The present was all-in-all. When she heard people\nstirring, she went in search of Mrs Morgan, whose shrewd, sharp\nmanners, unsoftened by inward respect for the poor girl, had awed\nRuth even when Mr Bellingham was by to protect her.\n\n\"Mrs Morgan,\" said she, sitting down in the little parlour\nappropriated to the landlady, for she felt her strength suddenly\ndesert her--\"Mrs Morgan, I'm afraid Mr Bellingham is very ill;\"--here\nshe burst into tears, but instantly checking herself, \"Oh, what\nmust I do?\" continued she; \"I don't think he has known anything all\nthrough the night, and he looks so strange and wild this morning.\"\n\nShe gazed up into Mrs Morgan's face, as if reading an oracle.\n\n\"Indeed, miss, ma'am, and it's a very awkward thing. But don't cry,\nthat can do no good, 'deed it can't. I'll go and see the poor young\nman myself, and then I can judge if a doctor is wanting.\"\n\nRuth followed Mrs Morgan upstairs. When they entered the sick-room Mr\nBellingham was sitting up in bed, looking wildly about him, and as he\nsaw them, he exclaimed:\n\n\"Ruth! Ruth! come here; I won't be left alone!\" and then he fell down\nexhausted on the pillow. Mrs Morgan went up and spoke to him, but he\ndid not answer or take any notice.\n\n\"I'll send for Mr Jones, my dear, 'deed and I will; we'll have him\nhere in a couple of hours, please God.\"\n\n\"Oh, can't he come sooner?\" asked Ruth, wild with terror.\n\n\"'Deed no; he lives at Llangl\u00c3\u00a2s when he's at home, and that's seven\nmile away, and he may be gone a round eight or nine mile on the other\nside Llangl\u00c3\u00a2s; but I'll send a boy on the pony directly.\"\n\nSaying this, Mrs Morgan left Ruth alone. There was nothing to be\ndone, for Mr Bellingham had again fallen into a heavy sleep. Sounds\nof daily life began, bells rang, breakfast-services clattered up\nand down the passages, and Ruth sat on shivering by the bedside in\nthat darkened room. Mrs Morgan sent her breakfast upstairs by a\nchambermaid, but Ruth motioned it away in her sick agony, and the\ngirl had no right to urge her to partake of it. That alone broke the\nmonotony of the long morning. She heard the sound of merry parties\nsetting out on excursions, on horseback or in carriages; and once,\nstiff and wearied, she stole to the window, and looked out on one\nside of the blind; but the day looked bright and discordant to her\naching, anxious heart. The gloom of the darkened room was better and\nmore befitting.\n\nIt was some hours after he was summoned before the doctor made his\nappearance. He questioned his patient, and, receiving no coherent\nanswers, he asked Ruth concerning the symptoms; but when she\nquestioned him in turn he only shook his head and looked grave. He\nmade a sign to Mrs Morgan to follow him out of the room, and they\nwent down to her parlour, leaving Ruth in a depth of despair, lower\nthan she could have thought it possible there remained for her to\nexperience, an hour before.\n\n\"I am afraid this is a bad case,\" said Mr Jones to Mrs Morgan in\nWelsh. \"A brain-fever has evidently set in.\"\n\n\"Poor young gentleman! poor young man! He looked the very picture of\nhealth!\"\n\n\"That very appearance of robustness will, in all probability, make\nhis disorder more violent. However, we must hope for the best, Mrs\nMorgan. Who is to attend upon him? He will require careful nursing.\nIs that young lady his sister? She looks too young to be his wife?\"\n\n\"No, indeed! Gentlemen like you must know, Mr Jones, that we can't\nalways look too closely into the ways of young men who come to\nour houses. Not but what I'm sorry for her, for she's an innocent,\ninoffensive young creature. I always think it right, for my own\nmorals, to put a little scorn into my manners when such as her come\nto stay here; but, indeed, she's so gentle, I've found it hard work\nto show the proper contempt.\"\n\nShe would have gone on to her inattentive listener if she had not\nheard a low tap at the door, which recalled her from her morality,\nand Mr Jones from his consideration of the necessary prescriptions.\n\n\"Come in!\" said Mrs Morgan, sharply. And Ruth came in. She was white\nand trembling; but she stood in that dignity which strong feeling,\nkept down by self-command, always imparts.\n\n\"I wish you, sir, to be so kind as to tell me, clearly and\ndistinctly, what I must do for Mr Bellingham. Every direction\nyou give me shall be most carefully attended to. You spoke about\nleeches--I can put them on, and see about them. Tell me everything,\nsir, that you wish to have done!\"\n\nHer manner was calm and serious, and her countenance and deportment\nshowed that the occasion was calling out strength sufficient to meet\nit. Mr Jones spoke with a deference which he had not thought of using\nupstairs, even while he supposed her to be the sister of the invalid.\nRuth listened gravely; she repeated some of the injunctions, in order\nthat she might be sure that she fully comprehended them, and then,\nbowing, left the room.\n\n\"She is no common person,\" said Mr Jones. \"Still she is too young to\nhave the responsibility of such a serious case. Have you any idea\nwhere his friends live, Mrs Morgan?\"\n\n\"Indeed and I have. His mother, as haughty a lady as you would wish\nto see, came travelling through Wales last year; she stopped here,\nand, I warrant you, nothing was good enough for her; she was real\nquality. She left some clothes and books behind her (for the maid was\nalmost as fine as the mistress, and little thought of seeing after\nher lady's clothes, having a taste for going to see scenery along\nwith the man-servant), and we had several letters from her. I have\nthem locked in the drawers in the bar, where I keep such things.\"\n\n\"Well! I should recommend your writing to the lady, and telling her\nher son's state.\"\n\n\"It would be a favour, Mr Jones, if you would just write it yourself.\nEnglish writing comes so strange to my pen.\"\n\nThe letter was written, and, in order to save time, Mr Jones took it\nto the Llangl\u00c3\u00a2s post-office.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe Crisis--Watching and Waiting\n\n\nRuth put away every thought of the past or future; everything that\ncould unfit her for the duties of the present. Exceeding love\nsupplied the place of experience. She never left the room after the\nfirst day; she forced herself to eat, because his service needed her\nstrength. She did not indulge in any tears, because the weeping she\nlonged for would make her less able to attend upon him. She watched,\nand waited, and prayed: prayed with an utter forgetfulness of self,\nonly with a consciousness that God was all-powerful, and that he,\nwhom she loved so much, needed the aid of the Mighty One.\n\nDay and night, the summer night, seemed merged into one. She lost\ncount of time in the hushed and darkened room. One morning Mrs Morgan\nbeckoned her out; and she stole on tiptoe into the dazzling gallery,\non one side of which the bedrooms opened.\n\n\"She's come,\" whispered Mrs Morgan, looking very much excited, and\nforgetting that Ruth had never heard that Mrs Bellingham had been\nsummoned.\n\n\"Who is come?\" asked Ruth. The idea of Mrs Mason flashed through her\nmind--but with a more terrible, because a more vague dread, she heard\nthat it was his mother; the mother of whom he had always spoken as a\nperson whose opinion was to be regarded more than that of any other\nindividual.\n\n\"What must I do? Will she be angry with me?\" said she, relapsing into\nher child-like dependence on others; and feeling that even Mrs Morgan\nwas some one to stand between her and Mrs Bellingham.\n\nMrs Morgan herself was a little perplexed. Her morality was rather\nshocked at the idea of a proper real lady like Mrs Bellingham\ndiscovering that she had winked at the connexion between her son and\nRuth. She was quite inclined to encourage Ruth in her inclination\nto shrink out of Mrs Bellingham's observation, an inclination which\narose from no definite consciousness of having done wrong, but\nprincipally from the representations she had always heard of the\nlady's awfulness. Mrs Bellingham swept into her son's room as if she\nwere unconscious what poor young creature had lately haunted it;\nwhile Ruth hurried into some unoccupied bedroom, and, alone there,\nshe felt her self-restraint suddenly give way, and burst into the\nsaddest, most utterly wretched weeping she had ever known. She was\nworn out with watching, and exhausted by passionate crying, and she\nlay down on the bed and fell asleep. The day passed on; she slumbered\nunnoticed and unregarded; she awoke late in the evening with a\nsense of having done wrong in sleeping so long; the strain upon\nher responsibility had not yet left her. Twilight was closing fast\naround; she waited until it had become night, and then she stole down\nto Mrs Morgan's parlour.\n\n\"If you please, may I come in?\" asked she.\n\nJenny Morgan was doing up the hieroglyphics which she called her\naccounts; she answered sharply enough, but it was a permission to\nenter, and Ruth was thankful for it.\n\n\"Will you tell me how he is? Do you think I may go back to him?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, that you may not. Nest, who has made his room tidy these\nmany days, is not fit to go in now. Mrs Bellingham has brought her\nown maid, and the family nurse, and Mr Bellingham's man; such a tribe\nof servants and no end to packages; water-beds coming by the carrier,\nand a doctor from London coming down to-morrow, as if feather-beds\nand Mr Jones was not good enough. Why, she won't let a soul of us\ninto the room; there's no chance for you!\"\n\nRuth sighed. \"How is he?\" she inquired, after a pause.\n\n\"How can I tell indeed, when I'm not allowed to go near him? Mr Jones\nsaid to-night was a turning point; but I doubt it, for it is four\ndays since he was taken ill, and who ever heard of a sick person\ntaking a turn on an even number of days; it's always on the third, or\nthe fifth, or seventh, or so on. He'll not turn till to-morrow night,\ntake my word for it, and their fine London doctor will get all the\ncredit, and honest Mr Jones will be thrown aside. I don't think he\nwill get better myself, though--Gelert does not howl for nothing. My\npatience! what's the matter with the girl?--lord, child, you're never\ngoing to faint, and be ill on my hands?\" Her sharp voice recalled\nRuth from the sick unconsciousness that had been creeping over her\nas she listened to the latter part of this speech. She sat down\nand could not speak--the room whirled round and round--her white\nfeebleness touched Mrs Morgan's heart.\n\n\"You've had no tea, I guess. Indeed, and the girls are very\ncareless.\" She rang the bell with energy, and seconded her pull\nby going to the door and shouting out sharp directions, in Welsh,\nto Nest and Gwen, and three or four other rough, kind, slatternly\nservants.\n\nThey brought her tea, which was comfortable, according to the idea of\ncomfort prevalent in that rude, hospitable place; there was plenty to\neat, too much, indeed, for it revolted the appetite it was intended\nto provoke. But the heartiness with which the kind, rosy waiter\npressed her to eat, and the scolding Mrs Morgan gave her when she\nfound the buttered toast untouched (toast on which she had herself\ndesired that the butter might not be spared), did Ruth more good than\nthe tea. She began to hope, and to long for the morning when hope\nmight have become certainty. It was all in vain that she was told\nthat the room she had been in all day was at her service; she did not\nsay a word, but she was not going to bed that night, of all nights in\nthe year, when life or death hung trembling in the balance. She went\ninto the bedroom till the bustling house was still, and heard busy\nfeet passing to and fro in the room she might not enter; and voices,\nimperious, though hushed down to a whisper, ask for innumerable\nthings. Then there was silence; and when she thought that all were\ndead asleep, except the watchers, she stole out into the gallery. On\nthe other side were two windows, cut into the thick stone wall, and\nflower pots were placed on the shelves thus formed, where great,\nuntrimmed, straggling geraniums grew, and strove to reach the light.\nThe window near Mr Bellingham's door was open; the soft, warm-scented\nnight air came sighing in in faint gusts, and then was still. It was\nsummer; there was no black darkness in the twenty-four hours; only\nthe light grew dusky, and colour disappeared from objects, of which\nthe shape and form remained distinct. A soft grey oblong of barred\nlight fell on the flat wall opposite to the windows, and deeper grey\nshadows marked out the tracery of the plants, more graceful thus than\nin reality. Ruth crouched where no light fell. She sat on the ground\nclose by the door; her whole existence was absorbed in listening;\nall was still; it was only her heart beating with the strong, heavy,\nregular sound of a hammer. She wished she could stop its rushing,\nincessant clang. She heard a rustle of a silken gown, and knew it\nought not to have been worn in a sick-room; for her senses seemed to\nhave passed into the keeping of the invalid, and to feel only as he\nfelt. The noise was probably occasioned by some change of posture in\nthe watcher inside, for it was once more dead-still. The soft wind\noutside sank with a low, long, distant moan among the windings of\nthe hills, and lost itself there, and came no more again. But Ruth's\nheart beat loud. She rose with as little noise as if she were a\nvision, and crept to the open window to try and lose the nervous\nlistening for the ever-recurring sound. Out beyond, under the calm\nsky, veiled with a mist rather than with a cloud, rose the high, dark\noutlines of the mountains, shutting in that village as if it lay in a\nnest. They stood, like giants, solemnly watching for the end of Earth\nand Time. Here and there a black round shadow reminded Ruth of some\n\"Cwm,\" or hollow, where she and her lover had rambled in sun and\nin gladness. She then thought the land enchanted into everlasting\nbrightness and happiness; she fancied, then, that into a region so\nlovely no bale or woe could enter, but would be charmed away and\ndisappear before the sight of the glorious guardian mountains. Now\nshe knew the truth, that earth has no barrier which avails against\nagony. It comes lightning-like down from heaven, into the mountain\nhouse and the town garret; into the palace and into the cottage. The\ngarden lay close under the house; a bright spot enough by day; for\nin that soil, whatever was planted grew and blossomed in spite of\nneglect. The white roses glimmered out in the dusk all the night\nthrough; the red were lost in shadow. Between the low boundary of\nthe garden and the hills swept one or two green meadows; Ruth looked\ninto the grey darkness till she traced each separate wave of outline.\nThen she heard a little restless bird chirp out its wakefulness from\na nest in the ivy round the walls of the house. But the mother-bird\nspread her soft feathers, and hushed it into silence. Presently,\nhowever, many little birds began to scent the coming dawn, and\nrustled among the leaves, and chirruped loud and clear. Just above\nthe horizon, too, the mist became a silvery grey cloud hanging on the\nedge of the world; presently it turned shimmering white; and then,\nin an instant, it flushed into rose, and the mountain-tops sprang\ninto heaven, and bathed in the presence of the shadow of God. With\na bound, the sun of a molten fiery red came above the horizon, and\nimmediately thousands of little birds sang out for joy, and a soft\nchorus of mysterious, glad murmurs came forth from the earth; the low\nwhispering wind left its hiding-place among the clefts and hollows of\nthe hills, and wandered among the rustling herbs and trees, waking\nthe flower-buds to the life of another day. Ruth gave a sigh of\nrelief that the night was over and gone; for she knew that soon\nsuspense would be ended, and the verdict known, whether for life or\nfor death. She grew faint and sick with anxiety; it almost seemed\nas if she must go into the room and learn the truth. Then she heard\nmovements, but they were not sharp or rapid, as if prompted by any\nemergency; then, again, it was still. She sat curled up upon the\nfloor, with her head thrown back against the wall, and her hands\nclasped round her knees. She had yet to wait. Meanwhile, the invalid\nwas slowly rousing himself from a long, deep, sound, health-giving\nsleep. His mother had sat by him the night through, and was now\ndaring to change her position for the first time; she was even\nventuring to give directions in a low voice to the old nurse, who\nhad dozed away in an arm-chair, ready to obey any summons of her\nmistress. Mrs Bellingham went on tiptoe towards the door, and chiding\nherself because her stiff, weary limbs made some slight noise. She\nhad an irrepressible longing for a few minutes' change of scene after\nher night of watching. She felt that the crisis was over; and the\nrelief to her mind made her conscious of every bodily feeling and\nirritation, which had passed unheeded as long as she had been in\nsuspense.\n\nShe slowly opened the door. Ruth sprang upright at the first sound\nof the creaking handle. Her very lips were stiff and unpliable with\nthe force of the blood which rushed to her head. It seemed as if she\ncould not form words. She stood right before Mrs Bellingham. \"How is\nhe, madam?\"\n\nMrs Bellingham was for a moment surprised at the white apparition\nwhich seemed to rise out of the ground. But her quick, proud mind\nunderstood it all in an instant. This was the girl, then, whose\nprofligacy had led her son astray; had raised up barriers in the way\nof her favourite scheme of his marriage with Miss Duncombe; nay, this\nwas the real cause of his illness, his mortal danger at this present\ntime, and of her bitter, keen anxiety. If, under any circumstances,\nMrs Bellingham could have been guilty of the ill-breeding of not\nanswering a question, it was now; and for a moment she was tempted to\npass on in silence. Ruth could not wait; she spoke again:\n\n\"For the love of God, madam, speak! How is he? Will he live?\"\n\nIf she did not answer her, she thought the creature was desperate\nenough to force her way into his room. So she spoke.\n\n\"He has slept well: he is better.\"\n\n\"Oh! my God, I thank Thee,\" murmured Ruth, sinking back against the\nwall.\n\nIt was too much to hear this wretched girl thanking God for her son's\nlife; as if, in fact, she had any lot or part in him, and to dare to\nspeak to the Almighty on her son's behalf! Mrs Bellingham looked at\nher with cold, contemptuous eyes, whose glances were like ice-bolts,\nand made Ruth shiver up away from them.\n\n\"Young woman, if you have any propriety or decency left, I trust that\nyou will not dare to force yourself into his room.\"\n\nShe stood for a moment as if awaiting an answer, and half expecting\nit to be a defiance. But she did not understand Ruth. She did not\nimagine the faithful trustfulness of her heart. Ruth believed that\nif Mr Bellingham was alive and likely to live, all was well. When he\nwanted her, he would send for her, ask for her, yearn for her, till\nevery one would yield before his steadfast will. At present she\nimagined that he was probably too weak to care or know who was about\nhim; and though it would have been an infinite delight to her to\nhover and brood around him, yet it was of him she thought and not\nof herself. She gently drew herself on one side to make way for Mrs\nBellingham to pass.\n\nBy-and-by Mrs Morgan came up. Ruth was still near the door, from\nwhich it seemed as if she could not tear herself away.\n\n\"Indeed, miss, and you must not hang about the door in this way; it\nis not pretty manners. Mrs Bellingham has been speaking very sharp\nand cross about it, and I shall lose the character of my inn if\npeople take to talking as she does. Did not I give you a room last\nnight to keep in, and never be seen or heard of; and did I not tell\nyou what a particular lady Mrs Bellingham was, but you must come out\nhere right in her way? Indeed, it was not pretty, nor grateful to me,\nJenny Morgan, and that I must say.\"\n\nRuth turned away like a chidden child. Mrs Morgan followed her to her\nroom, scolding as she went; and then, having cleared her heart after\nher wont by uttering hasty words, her real kindness made her add, in\na softened tone:\n\n\"You stop up here like a good girl. I'll send you your breakfast\nby-and-by, and let you know from time to time how he is; and you can\ngo out for a walk, you know; but if you do, I'll take it as a favour\nif you'll go out by the side door. It will, maybe, save scandal.\"\n\nAll that day long, Ruth kept herself close prisoner in the room to\nwhich Mrs Morgan accorded her; all that day, and many succeeding\ndays. But at nights, when the house was still, and even the little\nbrown mice had gathered up the crumbs, and darted again to their\nholes, Ruth stole out, and crept to his door to catch, if she could,\nthe sound of his beloved voice. She could tell by its tones how he\nfelt, and how he was getting on, as well as any of the watchers in\nthe room. She yearned and pined to see him once more; but she had\nreasoned herself down into something like patience. When he was well\nenough to leave his room, when he had not always one of the nurses\nwith him, then he would send for her, and she would tell him how very\npatient she had been for his dear sake. But it was long to wait even\nwith this thought of the manner in which the waiting would end. Poor\nRuth! her faith was only building up vain castles in the air; they\ntowered up into heaven, it is true, but, after all, they were but\nvisions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMrs Bellingham \"Does the Thing Handsomely\"\n\n\nIf Mr Bellingham did not get rapidly well, it was more owing to\nthe morbid querulous fancy attendant on great weakness than from\nany unfavourable medical symptom. But he turned away with peevish\nloathing from the very sight of food, prepared in the slovenly manner\nwhich had almost disgusted him when he was well. It was of no use\ntelling him that Simpson, his mother's maid, had superintended the\npreparation at every point. He offended her by detecting something\noffensive and to be avoided in her daintiest messes, and made Mrs\nMorgan mutter many a hasty speech, which, however, Mrs Bellingham\nthought it better not to hear until her son should be strong enough\nto travel.\n\n\"I think you are better to-day,\" said she, as his man wheeled his\nsofa to the bedroom window. \"We shall get you downstairs to-morrow.\"\n\n\"If it were to get away from this abominable place, I could go down\nto-day; but I believe I'm to be kept prisoner here for ever. I shall\nnever get well here, I'm sure.\"\n\nHe sank back on his sofa in impatient despair. The surgeon was\nannounced, and eagerly questioned by Mrs Bellingham as to the\npossibility of her son's removal; and he, having heard the same\nanxiety for the same end expressed by Mrs Morgan in the regions\nbelow, threw no great obstacles in the way. After the doctor had\ntaken his departure, Mrs Bellingham cleared her throat several times.\nMr Bellingham knew the prelude of old, and winced with nervous\nannoyance.\n\n\"Henry, there is something I must speak to you about; an unpleasant\nsubject, certainly, but one which has been forced upon me by the very\ngirl herself; you must be aware to what I refer without giving me the\npain of explaining myself.\"\n\nMr Bellingham turned himself sharply round to the wall, and prepared\nhimself for a lecture by concealing his face from her notice; but she\nherself was in too nervous a state to be capable of observation.\n\n\"Of course,\" she continued, \"it was my wish to be as blind to the\nwhole affair as possible, though you can't imagine how Mrs Mason has\nblazoned it abroad; all Fordham rings with it; but of course it could\nnot be pleasant, or, indeed, I may say correct, for me to be aware\nthat a person of such improper character was under the same--I beg\nyour pardon, dear Henry, what do you say?\"\n\n\"Ruth is no improper character, mother; you do her injustice!\"\n\n\"My dear boy, you don't mean to uphold her as a paragon of virtue!\"\n\n\"No, mother, but I led her wrong; I--\"\n\n\"We will let all discussions into the cause or duration of her\npresent character drop, if you please,\" said Mrs Bellingham, with\nthe sort of dignified authority which retained a certain power over\nher son--a power which originated in childhood, and which he only\ndefied when he was roused into passion. He was too weak in body to\noppose himself to her, and fight the ground inch by inch. \"As I have\nimplied, I do not wish to ascertain your share of blame; from what\nI saw of her one morning, I am convinced of her forward, intrusive\nmanners, utterly without shame, or even common modesty.\"\n\n\"What are you referring to?\" asked Mr Bellingham, sharply.\n\n\"Why, when you were at the worst, and I had been watching you all\nnight, and had just gone out in the morning for a breath of fresh\nair, this girl pushed herself before me, and insisted upon speaking\nto me. I really had to send Mrs Morgan to her before I could return\nto your room. A more impudent, hardened manner, I never saw.\"\n\n\"Ruth was neither impudent nor hardened; she was ignorant enough, and\nmight offend from knowing no better.\"\n\nHe was getting weary of the discussion, and wished it had never\nbeen begun. From the time he had become conscious of his mother's\npresence, he had felt the dilemma he was in in regard to Ruth, and\nvarious plans had directly crossed his brain; but it had been so\ntroublesome to weigh and consider them all properly, that they\nhad been put aside to be settled when he grew stronger. But this\ndifficulty in which he was placed by his connexion with Ruth,\nassociated the idea of her in his mind with annoyance and angry\nregret at the whole affair. He wished, in the languid way in which\nhe wished and felt everything not immediately relating to his daily\ncomfort, that he had never seen her. It was a most awkward, a most\nunfortunate affair. Notwithstanding this annoyance connected with\nand arising out of Ruth, he would not submit to hear her abused;\nand something in his manner impressed this on his mother, for she\nimmediately changed her mode of attack.\n\n\"We may as well drop all dispute as to the young woman's manners;\nbut I suppose you do not mean to defend your connexion with her; I\nsuppose you are not so lost to all sense of propriety as to imagine\nit fit or desirable that your mother and this degraded girl should\nremain under the same roof, liable to meet at any hour of the day?\"\nShe waited for an answer, but no answer came.\n\n\"I ask you a simple question; is it, or is it not desirable?\"\n\n\"I suppose it is not,\" he replied, gloomily.\n\n\"And _I_ suppose, from your manner, that you think the difficulty\nwould be best solved by my taking my departure, and leaving you with\nyour vicious companion?\"\n\nAgain no answer, but inward and increasing annoyance, of which Mr\nBellingham considered Ruth the cause. At length he spoke.\n\n\"Mother, you are not helping me in my difficulty. I have no desire\nto banish you, nor to hurt you, after all your care for me. Ruth has\nnot been so much to blame as you imagine, that I must say; but I\ndo not wish to see her again, if you can tell me how to arrange it\notherwise, without behaving unhandsomely. Only spare me all this\nworry while I am so weak. I put myself in your hands. Dismiss her, as\nyou wish it; but let it be done handsomely, and let me hear no more\nabout it; I cannot bear it; let me have a quiet life, without being\nlectured while I am pent up here, and unable to shake off unpleasant\nthoughts.\"\n\n\"My dear Henry, rely upon me.\"\n\n\"No more, mother; it's a bad business, and I can hardly avoid blaming\nmyself in the matter; I don't want to dwell upon it.\"\n\n\"Don't be too severe in your self-reproaches while you are so feeble,\ndear Henry; it is right to repent, but I have no doubt in my own mind\nshe led you wrong with her artifices. But, as you say, everything\nshould be done handsomely. I confess I was deeply grieved when I\nfirst heard of the affair, but since I have seen the girl-- Well!\nI'll say no more about her, since I see it displeases you; but I am\nthankful to God that you see the error of your ways.\"\n\nShe sat silent, thinking for a little while, and then sent for her\nwriting-case, and began to write. Her son became restless, and\nnervously irritated.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, \"this affair worries me to death. I cannot shake\noff the thoughts of it.\"\n\n\"Leave it to me, I'll arrange it satisfactorily.\"\n\n\"Could we not leave to-night? I should not be so haunted by this\nannoyance in another place. I dread seeing her again, because I fear\na scene; and yet I believe I ought to see her, in order to explain.\"\n\n\"You must not think of such a thing, Henry,\" said she, alarmed at\nthe very idea. \"Sooner than that, we will leave in half an hour, and\ntry to get to Pen tr\u00c3\u00aa Voelas to-night. It is not yet three, and the\nevenings are very long. Simpson should stay and finish the packing;\nshe could go straight to London and meet us there. Macdonald and\nnurse could go with us. Could you bear twenty miles, do you think?\"\n\nAnything to get rid of his uneasiness. He felt that he was not\nbehaving as he should do, to Ruth, though the really right never\nentered his head. But it would extricate him from his present\ndilemma, and save him many lectures; he knew that his mother, always\nliberal where money was concerned, would \"do the thing handsomely,\"\nand it would always be easy to write and give Ruth what explanation\nhe felt inclined, in a day or two; so he consented, and soon lost\nsome of his uneasiness in watching the bustle of the preparation for\ntheir departure.\n\nAll this time Ruth was quietly spending in her room, beguiling the\nwaiting, weary hours, with pictures of the meeting at the end.\nHer room looked to the back, and was in a side-wing away from the\nprincipal state apartments, consequently she was not roused to\nsuspicion by any of the commotion; but, indeed, if she had heard\nthe banging of doors, the sharp directions, the carriage-wheels,\nshe would still not have suspected the truth; her own love was too\nfaithful.\n\nIt was four o'clock and past, when some one knocked at her door,\nand, on entering, gave her a note, which Mrs Bellingham had left.\nThat lady had found some difficulty in wording it, so as to satisfy\nherself, but it was as follows:\n\n\n   My son, on recovering from his illness, is, I thank God,\n   happily conscious of the sinful way in which he has been\n   living with you. By his earnest desire, and in order to\n   avoid seeing you again, we are on the point of leaving\n   this place; but before I go, I wish to exhort you to\n   repentance, and to remind you that you will not have your\n   own guilt alone upon your head, but that of any young man\n   whom you may succeed in entrapping into vice. I shall\n   pray that you may turn to an honest life, and I strongly\n   recommend you, if indeed you are not 'dead in trespasses\n   and sins,' to enter some penitentiary. In accordance\n   with my son's wishes, I forward you in this envelope a\n   bank-note of fifty pounds.\n\n   MARGARET BELLINGHAM.\n\n\nWas this the end of all? Had he, indeed, gone? She started up, and\nasked this last question of the servant, who, half guessing at the\npurport of the note, had lingered about the room, curious to see the\neffect produced.\n\n\"Iss, indeed, miss; the carriage drove from the door as I came\nupstairs. You'll see it now on the Yspytty road, if you'll please to\ncome to the window of No. 24.\"\n\nRuth started up, and followed the chambermaid. Aye, there it was,\nslowly winding up the steep white road, on which it seemed to move at\na snail's pace.\n\nShe might overtake him--she might--she might speak one farewell word\nto him, print his face on her heart with a last look--nay, when\nhe saw her he might retract, and not utterly, for ever, leave her.\nThus she thought; and she flew back to her room, and snatching up\nher bonnet, ran, tying the strings with her trembling hands as she\nwent down the stairs, out at the nearest door, little heeding the\nangry words of Mrs Morgan; for the hostess, more irritated at Mrs\nBellingham's severe upbraiding at parting, than mollified by her\nample payment, was offended by the circumstance of Ruth, in her wild\nhaste, passing through the prohibited front door.\n\nBut Ruth was away before Mrs Morgan had finished her speech, out\nand away, scudding along the road, thought-lost in the breathless\nrapidity of her motion. Though her heart and head beat almost to\nbursting, what did it signify if she could but overtake the carriage?\nIt was a nightmare, constantly evading the most passionate wishes and\nendeavours, and constantly gaining ground. Every time it was visible\nit was in fact more distant, but Ruth would not believe it. If she\ncould but gain the summit of that weary, everlasting hill, she\nbelieved that she could run again, and would soon be nigh upon the\ncarriage. As she ran, she prayed with wild eagerness; she prayed that\nshe might see his face once more, even if she died on the spot before\nhim. It was one of those prayers which God is too merciful to grant;\nbut despairing and wild as it was, Ruth put her soul into it, and\nprayed it again, and yet again.\n\nWave above wave of the ever-rising hills were gained, were crossed,\nand at last Ruth struggled up to the very top and stood on the bare\ntable of moor, brown and purple, stretching far away till it was lost\nin the haze of the summer afternoon; and the white road was all flat\nbefore her, but the carriage she sought and the figure she sought had\ndisappeared. There was no human being there; a few wild, black-faced\nmountain sheep quietly grazing near the road, as if it were long\nsince they had been disturbed by the passing of any vehicle, was all\nthe life she saw on the bleak moorland.\n\nShe threw herself down on the ling by the side of the road in\ndespair. Her only hope was to die, and she believed she was dying.\nShe could not think; she could believe anything. Surely life was a\nhorrible dream, and God would mercifully awaken her from it. She had\nno penitence, no consciousness of error or offence; no knowledge\nof any one circumstance but that he was gone. Yet afterwards, long\nafterwards, she remembered the exact motion of a bright green beetle\nbusily meandering among the wild thyme near her, and she recalled the\nmusical, balanced, wavering drop of a skylark into her nest near the\nheather-bed where she lay. The sun was sinking low, the hot air had\nceased to quiver near the hotter earth, when she bethought her once\nmore of the note which she had impatiently thrown down before half\nmastering its contents. \"Oh, perhaps,\" she thought, \"I have been too\nhasty. There may be some words of explanation from him on the other\nside of the page, to which, in my blind anguish, I never turned. I\nwill go and find it.\"\n\nShe lifted herself heavily and stiffly from the crushed heather.\nShe stood dizzy and confused with her change of posture; and was so\nunable to move at first, that her walk was but slow and tottering;\nbut, by-and-by, she was tasked and goaded by thoughts which forced\nher into rapid motion, as if, by it, she could escape from her agony.\nShe came down on the level ground, just as many gay or peaceful\ngroups were sauntering leisurely home with hearts at ease; with low\nlaughs and quiet smiles, and many an exclamation at the beauty of the\nsummer evening.\n\nEver since her adventure with the little boy and his sister, Ruth had\nhabitually avoided encountering these happy--innocents, may I call\nthem?--these happy fellow-mortals! And even now, the habit grounded\non sorrowful humiliation had power over her; she paused, and then,\non looking back, she saw more people who had come into the main road\nfrom a side path. She opened a gate into a pasture-field, and crept\nup to the hedge-bank until all should have passed by, and she could\nsteal into the inn unseen. She sat down on the sloping turf by the\nroots of an old hawthorn-tree which grew in the hedge; she was still\ntearless with hot burning eyes; she heard the merry walkers pass by;\nshe heard the footsteps of the village children as they ran along to\ntheir evening play; she saw the small black cows come into the fields\nafter being milked; and life seemed yet abroad. When would the world\nbe still and dark, and fit for such a deserted, desolate creature\nas she was? Even in her hiding-place she was not long at peace. The\nlittle children, with their curious eyes peering here and there, had\npeeped through the hedge, and through the gate, and now they gathered\nfrom all the four corners of the hamlet, and crowded round the gate;\nand one more adventurous than the rest had run into the field to\ncry, \"Gi' me a halfpenny,\" which set the example to every little one,\nemulous of his boldness; and there, where she sat, low on the ground,\nand longing for the sure hiding-place earth gives to the weary, the\nchildren kept running in, and pushing one another forwards, and\nlaughing. Poor things; their time had not come for understanding what\nsorrow is. Ruth would have begged them to leave her alone, and not\nmadden her utterly; but they knew no English save the one eternal\n\"Gi' me a halfpenny.\" She felt in her heart that there was no pity\nanywhere. Suddenly, while she thus doubted God, a shadow fell across\nher garments, on which her miserable eyes were bent. She looked up.\nThe deformed gentleman she had twice before seen, stood there. He had\nbeen attracted by the noisy little crowd, and had questioned them in\nWelsh, but not understanding enough of the language to comprehend\ntheir answers, he had obeyed their signs, and entered the gate to\nwhich they pointed. There he saw the young girl whom he had noticed\nat first for her innocent beauty, and the second time for the idea he\nhad gained respecting her situation; there he saw her, crouched up\nlike some hunted creature, with a wild, scared look of despair, which\nalmost made her lovely face seem fierce; he saw her dress soiled and\ndim, her bonnet crushed and battered with her tossings to and fro on\nthe moorland bed; he saw the poor, lost wanderer, and when he saw\nher, he had compassion on her.\n\nThere was some look of heavenly pity in his eyes, as gravely and\nsadly they met her upturned gaze, which touched her stony heart.\nStill looking at him, as if drawing some good influence from him,\nshe said low and mournfully, \"He has left me, sir!--sir, he has\nindeed--he has gone and left me!\"\n\nBefore he could speak a word to comfort her, she had burst into the\nwildest, dreariest crying ever mortal cried. The settled form of the\nevent, when put into words, went sharp to her heart; her moans and\nsobs wrung his soul; but as no speech of his could be heard, if he\nhad been able to decide what best to say, he stood by her in apparent\ncalmness, while she, wretched, wailed and uttered her woe. But when\nshe lay worn out, and stupefied into silence, she heard him say to\nhimself, in a low voice:\n\n\"Oh, my God! for Christ's sake, pity her!\"\n\nRuth lifted up her eyes, and looked at him with a dim perception of\nthe meaning of his words. She regarded him fixedly in a dreamy way,\nas if they struck some chord in her heart, and she were listening to\nits echo; and so it was. His pitiful look, or his words, reminded her\nof the childish days when she knelt at her mother's knee, and she was\nonly conscious of a straining, longing desire to recall it all.\n\nHe let her take her time, partly because he was powerfully affected\nhimself by all the circumstances, and by the sad pale face upturned\nto his; and partly by an instinctive consciousness that the softest\npatience was required. But suddenly she startled him, as she herself\nwas startled into a keen sense of the suffering agony of the present;\nshe sprang up and pushed him aside, and went rapidly towards the gate\nof the field. He could not move as quickly as most men, but he put\nforth his utmost speed. He followed across the road, on to the rocky\ncommon; but as he went along, with his uncertain gait, in the dusk\ngloaming, he stumbled, and fell over some sharp projecting stone. The\nacute pain which shot up his back forced a short cry from him; and,\nwhen bird and beast are hushed into rest and the stillness of the\nnight is over all, a high-pitched sound, like the voice of pain,\nis carried far in the quiet air. Ruth, speeding on in her despair,\nheard the sharp utterance, and stopped suddenly short. It did what\nno remonstrance could have done; it called her out of herself. The\ntender nature was in her still, in that hour when all good angels\nseemed to have abandoned her. In the old days she could never bear\nto hear or see bodily suffering in any of God's meanest creatures,\nwithout trying to succour them; and now, in her rush to the awful\ndeath of the suicide, she stayed her wild steps, and turned to find\nfrom whom that sharp sound of anguish had issued.\n\nHe lay among the white stones, too faint with pain to move, but with\nan agony in his mind far keener than any bodily pain, as he thought\nthat by his unfortunate fall he had lost all chance of saving her.\nHe was almost overpowered by his intense thankfulness when he saw\nher white figure pause, and stand listening, and turn again with\nslow footsteps, as if searching for some lost thing. He could hardly\nspeak, but he made a sound which, though his heart was inexpressibly\nglad, was like a groan. She came quickly towards him.\n\n\"I am hurt,\" said he; \"do not leave me;\" his disabled and tender\nframe was overcome by the accident and the previous emotions, and he\nfainted away. Ruth flew to the little mountain stream, the dashing\nsound of whose waters had been tempting her, but a moment before, to\nseek forgetfulness in the deep pool into which they fell. She made a\nbasin of her joined hands, and carried enough of the cold fresh water\nback to dash into his face and restore him to consciousness. While he\nstill kept silence, uncertain what to say best fitted to induce her\nto listen to him, she said softly:\n\n\"Are you better, sir?--are you very much hurt?\"\n\n\"Not very much; I am better. Any quick movement is apt to cause me a\nsudden loss of power in my back, and I believe I stumbled over some\nof these projecting stones. It will soon go off, and you will help me\nto go home, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! Can you go now? I am afraid of your lying too long on this\nheather; there is a heavy dew.\"\n\nHe was so anxious to comply with her wish, and not weary out her\nthought for him, and so turn her back upon herself, that he tried to\nrise. The pain was acute, and this she saw.\n\n\"Don't hurry yourself, sir; I can wait.\"\n\nThen came across her mind the recollection of the business that was\nthus deferred; but the few homely words which had been exchanged\nbetween them seemed to have awakened her from her madness. She sat\ndown by him, and, covering her face with her hands, cried mournfully\nand unceasingly. She forgot his presence, and yet she had a\nconsciousness that some one looked for her kind offices, that she\nwas wanted in the world, and must not rush hastily out of it. The\nconsciousness did not take this definite form, it did not become a\nthought, but it kept her still, and it was gradually soothing her.\n\n\"Can you help me to rise now?\" said he, after a while. She did not\nspeak, but she helped him up, and then he took her arm, and she led\nhim tenderly through all the little velvet paths, where the turf grew\nshort and soft between the rugged stones. Once more on the highway,\nthey slowly passed along in the moonlight. He guided her by a slight\nmotion of the arm, through the more unfrequented lanes, to his\nlodgings at the shop; for he thought for her, and conceived the pain\nshe would have in seeing the lighted windows of the inn. He leant\nmore heavily on her arm, as they awaited the opening of the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" said he, not relaxing his hold, and yet dreading to\ntighten it, lest she should defy restraint, and once more rush away.\n\nThey went slowly into the little parlour behind the shop. The\nbonny-looking hostess, Mrs Hughes by name, made haste to light the\ncandle, and then they saw each other, face to face. The deformed\ngentleman looked very pale, but Ruth looked as if the shadow of death\nwas upon her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe Storm-Spirit Subdued\n\n\nMrs Hughes bustled about with many a sympathetic exclamation, now in\npretty broken English, now in more fluent Welsh, which sounded as\nsoft as Russian or Italian, in her musical voice. Mr Benson, for that\nwas the name of the hunchback, lay on the sofa, thinking; while the\ntender Mrs Hughes made every arrangement for his relief from pain.\nHe had lodged with her for three successive years, and she knew and\nloved him.\n\nRuth stood in the little bow-window, looking out. Across the moon,\nand over the deep blue heavens, large, torn, irregular-shaped clouds\nwent hurrying, as if summoned by some storm-spirit. The work they\nwere commanded to do was not here; the mighty gathering-place lay\neastward, immeasurable leagues, and on they went, chasing each other\nover the silent earth, now black, now silver-white at one transparent\nedge, now with the moon shining like Hope through their darkest\ncentre, now again with a silver lining; and now, utterly black,\nthey sailed lower in the lift, and disappeared behind the immovable\nmountains; they were rushing in the very direction in which Ruth\nhad striven and struggled to go that afternoon; they, in their wild\ncareer, would soon pass over the very spot where he (her world's he)\nwas lying sleeping, or perhaps not sleeping, perhaps thinking of her.\nThe storm was in her mind, and rent and tore her purposes into forms\nas wild and irregular as the heavenly shapes she was looking at. If,\nlike them, she could pass the barrier horizon in the night, she might\novertake him.\n\nMr Benson saw her look, and read it partially. He saw her longing\ngaze outwards upon the free, broad world, and thought that the syren\nwaters, whose deadly music yet rang in her ears, were again tempting\nher. He called her to him, praying that his feeble voice might have\npower.\n\n\"My dear young lady, I have much to say to you; and God has taken\nmy strength from me now when I most need it.--Oh, I sin to speak\nso--but, for His sake, I implore you to be patient here, if only till\nto-morrow morning.\" He looked at her, but her face was immovable, and\nshe did not speak. She could not give up her hope, her chance, her\nliberty till to-morrow.\n\n\"God help me,\" said he, mournfully, \"my words do not touch her;\"\nand, still holding her hand, he sank back on the pillows. Indeed,\nit was true that his words did not vibrate in her atmosphere. The\nstorm-spirit raged there, and filled her heart with the thought that\nshe was an outcast; and the holy words, \"for His sake,\" were answered\nby the demon, who held possession, with a blasphemous defiance of the\nmerciful God:\n\n\"What have I to do with Thee?\"\n\nHe thought of every softening influence of religion which over his\nown disciplined heart had power, but put them aside as useless. Then\nthe still small voice whispered, and he spake:\n\n\"In your mother's name, whether she be dead or alive, I command you\nto stay here until I am able to speak to you.\"\n\nShe knelt down at the foot of the sofa, and shook it with her sobs.\nHer heart was touched, and he hardly dared to speak again. At length\nhe said:\n\n\"I know you will not go--you could not--for her sake. You will not,\nwill you?\"\n\n\"No,\" whispered Ruth; and then there was a great blank in her heart.\nShe had given up her chance. She was calm, in the utter absence of\nall hope.\n\n\"And now you will do what I tell you,\" said he, gently, but,\nunconsciously to himself, in the tone of one who has found the hidden\nspell by which to rule spirits.\n\nShe slowly said, \"Yes.\" But she was subdued.\n\nHe called Mrs Hughes. She came from her adjoining shop.\n\n\"You have a bedroom within yours, where your daughter used to sleep,\nI think? I am sure you will oblige me, and I shall consider it as\na great favour, if you will allow this young lady to sleep there\nto-night. Will you take her there now? Go, my dear. I have full trust\nin your promise not to leave until I can speak to you.\" His voice\ndied away to silence; but as Ruth rose from her knees at his bidding,\nshe looked at his face through her tears. His lips were moving in\nearnest, unspoken prayer, and she knew it was for her.\n\nThat night, although his pain was relieved by rest, he could not\nsleep; and, as in fever, the coming events kept unrolling themselves\nbefore him in every changing and fantastic form. He met Ruth in all\npossible places and ways, and addressed her in every manner he could\nimagine most calculated to move and affect her to penitence and\nvirtue. Towards morning he fell asleep, but the same thoughts haunted\nhis dreams; he spoke, but his voice refused to utter aloud; and she\nfled, relentless, to the deep, black pool.\n\nBut God works in His own way.\n\nThe visions melted into deep, unconscious sleep. He was awakened by a\nknock at the door, which seemed a repetition of what he had heard in\nhis last sleeping moments.\n\nIt was Mrs Hughes. She stood at the first word of permission within\nthe room.\n\n\"Please, sir, I think the young lady is very ill indeed, sir; perhaps\nyou would please to come to her.\"\n\n\"How is she ill?\" said he, much alarmed.\n\n\"Quite quiet-like, sir; but I think she is dying, that's all, indeed,\nsir!\"\n\n\"Go away, I will be with you directly!\" he replied, his heart sinking\nwithin him.\n\nIn a very short time he was standing with Mrs Hughes by Ruth's\nbedside. She lay as still as if she were dead, her eyes shut, her wan\nface numbed into a fixed anguish of expression. She did not speak\nwhen they spoke, though after a while they thought she strove to\ndo so. But all power of motion and utterance had left her. She was\ndressed in everything, except her bonnet, as she had been the day\nbefore; although sweet, thoughtful Mrs Hughes had provided her with\nnightgear, which lay on the little chest of drawers that served as\na dressing-table. Mr Benson lifted up her arm to feel her feeble,\nfluttering pulse; and when he let go her hand, it fell upon the bed\nin a dull, heavy way, as if she were already dead.\n\n\"You gave her some food?\" said he, anxiously, to Mrs Hughes.\n\n\"Indeed, and I offered her the best in the house, but she shook her\npoor pretty head, and only asked if I would please to get her a cup\nof water. I brought her some milk though, and 'deed, I think she'd\nrather have had the water; but not to seem sour and cross, she took\nsome milk.\" By this time Mrs Hughes was fairly crying.\n\n\"When does the doctor come up here?\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir, and he's up nearly every day now, the inn is so full.\"\n\n\"I'll go for him. And can you manage to undress her and lay her in\nbed? Open the window too, and let in the air; if her feet are cold,\nput bottles of hot water to them.\"\n\nIt was a proof of the true love, which was the nature of both, that\nit never crossed their minds to regret that this poor young creature\nhad been thus thrown upon their hands. On the contrary, Mrs Hughes\ncalled it \"a blessing.\"\n\n\n   \"It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nA Note and the Answer\n\n\nAt the inn everything was life and bustle. Mr Benson had to wait long\nin Mrs Morgan's little parlour before she could come to him, and he\nkept growing more and more impatient. At last she made her appearance\nand heard his story.\n\nPeople may talk as they will about the little respect that is paid to\nvirtue, unaccompanied by the outward accidents of wealth or station;\nbut I rather think it will be found that, in the long run, true and\nsimple virtue always has its proportionate reward in the respect\nand reverence of every one whose esteem is worth having. To be\nsure, it is not rewarded after the way of the world as mere worldly\npossessions are, with low obeisance and lip-service; but all the\nbetter and more noble qualities in the hearts of others make ready\nand go forth to meet it on its approach, provided only it be pure,\nsimple, and unconscious of its own existence.\n\nMr Benson had little thought for outward tokens of respect just then,\nnor had Mrs Morgan much time to spare; but she smoothed her ruffled\nbrow, and calmed her bustling manner, as soon as ever she saw who it\nwas that awaited her; for Mr Benson was well known in the village\nwhere he had taken up his summer holiday among the mountains year\nafter year, always a resident at the shop, and seldom spending a\nshilling at the inn.\n\nMrs Morgan listened patiently--for her.\n\n\"Mr Jones will come this afternoon. But it is a shame you should be\ntroubled with such as her. I had but little time yesterday, but I\nguessed there was something wrong, and Gwen has just been telling me\nher bed has not been slept in. They were in a pretty hurry to be gone\nyesterday, for all that the gentleman was not fit to travel, to my\nway of thinking; indeed, William Wynn, the post-boy, said he was\nweary enough before he got to the end of that Yspytty road; and he\nthought they would have to rest there a day or two before they could\ngo further than Pen tr\u00c3\u00aa Voelas. Indeed, and anyhow, the servant is to\nfollow them with the baggage this very morning; and now I remember,\nWilliam Wynn said they would wait for her. You'd better write a note,\nMr Benson, and tell them her state.\"\n\nIt was good, though unpalatable advice. It came from one accustomed\nto bring excellent, if unrefined sense, to bear quickly upon any\nemergency, and to decide rapidly. She was, in truth, so little\naccustomed to have her authority questioned, that before Mr Benson\nhad made up his mind, she had produced paper, pens, and ink from the\ndrawer in her bureau, placed them before him, and was going to leave\nthe room.\n\n\"Leave the note on this shelf, and trust me that it goes by the maid.\nThe boy that drives her there in the car shall bring you an answer\nback.\"\n\nShe was gone before he could rally his scattered senses enough to\nremember that he had not the least idea of the name of the party to\nwhom he was to write. The quiet leisure and peace of his little study\nat home favoured his habit of reverie and long deliberation, just as\nher position as mistress of an inn obliged her to quick, decisive\nways.\n\nHer advice, though good in some points, was unpalatable in others. It\nwas true that Ruth's condition ought to be known by those who were\nher friends; but were these people to whom he was now going to write,\nfriends? He knew there was a rich mother, and a handsome, elegant\nson; and he had also some idea of the circumstances which might a\nlittle extenuate their mode of quitting Ruth. He had wide enough\nsympathy to understand that it must have been a most painful position\nin which the mother had been placed, on finding herself under the\nsame roof with a girl who was living with her son, as Ruth was. And\nyet he did not like to apply to her; to write to the son was still\nmore out of the question, as it seemed like asking him to return.\nBut through one or the other lay the only clue to her friends, who\ncertainly ought to be made acquainted with her position. At length he\nwrote:\n\n\n   MADAM,--I write to tell you of the condition of\n   the poor young woman--[here came a long pause of\n   deliberation]--who accompanied your son on his arrival\n   here, and who was left behind on your departure yesterday.\n   She is lying (as it appears to me) in a very dangerous\n   state at my lodgings; and, if I may suggest, it would be\n   kind to allow your maid to return and attend upon her\n   until she is sufficiently recovered to be restored to her\n   friends, if, indeed, they could not come to take charge of\n   her themselves.\n\n   I remain, madam,\n   Your obedient servant,\n\n   THURSTAN BENSON.\n\n\nThe note was very unsatisfactory after all his consideration, but it\nwas the best he could do. He made inquiry of a passing servant as to\nthe lady's name, directed the note, and placed it on the indicated\nshelf. He then returned to his lodgings, to await the doctor's coming\nand the post-boy's return. There was no alteration in Ruth; she was\nas one stunned into unconsciousness; she did not move her posture,\nshe hardly breathed. From time to time Mrs Hughes wetted her mouth\nwith some liquid, and there was a little mechanical motion of the\nlips; that was the only sign of life she gave. The doctor came and\nshook his head,--\"a thorough prostration of strength, occasioned by\nsome great shock on the nerves,\"--and prescribed care and quiet, and\nmysterious medicines, but acknowledged that the result was doubtful,\nvery doubtful. After his departure, Mr Benson took his Welsh grammar\nand tried again to master the ever-puzzling rules for the mutations\nof letters; but it was of no use, for his thoughts were absorbed by\nthe life-in-death condition of the young creature, who was lately\nbounding and joyous.\n\nThe maid and the luggage, the car and the driver, had arrived before\nnoon at their journey's end, and the note had been delivered. It\nannoyed Mrs Bellingham exceedingly. It was the worst of these kind\nof connexions, there was no calculating the consequences; they were\nnever-ending. All sorts of claims seemed to be established, and\nall sorts of people to step in to their settlement. The idea of\nsending her maid! Why, Simpson would not go if she asked her. She\nsoliloquised thus while reading the letter; and then, suddenly\nturning round to the favourite attendant, who had been listening to\nher mistress's remarks with no inattentive ear, she asked:\n\n\"Simpson, would you go and nurse this creature, as this--\" she looked\nat the signature--\"Mr Benson, whoever he is, proposes?\"\n\n\"Me! no, indeed, ma'am,\" said the maid, drawing herself up, stiff in\nher virtue. \"I'm sure, ma'am, you would not expect it of me; I could\nnever have the face to dress a lady of character again.\"\n\n\"Well, well! don't be alarmed; I cannot spare you; by the way, just\nattend to the strings on my dress; the chambermaid here pulled them\ninto knots, and broke them terribly, last night. It is awkward\nthough, very,\" said she, relapsing into a musing fit over the\ncondition of Ruth.\n\n\"If you'll allow me, ma'am, I think I might say something that would\nalter the case. I believe, ma'am, you put a bank-note into the letter\nto the young woman yesterday?\"\n\nMrs Bellingham bowed acquiescence, and the maid went on:\n\n\"Because, ma'am, when the little deformed man wrote that note (he's\nMr Benson, ma'am), I have reason to believe neither he nor Mrs\nMorgan knew of any provision being made for the young woman. Me and\nthe chambermaid found your letter and the bank-note lying quite\npromiscuous, like waste paper, on the floor of her room; for I\nbelieve she rushed out like mad after you left.\"\n\n\"That, as you say, alters the case. This letter, then, is principally\na sort of delicate hint that some provision ought to have been made,\nwhich is true enough, only it has been attended to already; what\nbecame of the money?\"\n\n\"Law, ma'am! do you ask? Of course, as soon as I saw it, I picked it\nup and took it to Mrs Morgan, in trust for the young person.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's right. What friends has she? Did you ever hear from\nMason?--perhaps they ought to know where she is.\"\n\n\"Mrs Mason did tell me, ma'am, she was an orphan; with a guardian who\nwas no-ways akin, and who washed his hands of her when she ran off;\nbut Mrs Mason was sadly put out, and went into hysterics, for fear\nyou would think she had not seen after her enough, and that she might\nlose your custom; she said it was no fault of hers, for the girl was\nalways a forward creature, boasting of her beauty, and saying how\npretty she was, and striving to get where her good looks could be\nseen and admired,--one night in particular, ma'am, at a county ball;\nand how Mrs Mason had found out she used to meet Mr Bellingham at an\nold woman's house, who was a regular old witch, ma'am, and lives in\nthe lowest part of the town, where all the bad characters haunt.\"\n\n\"There! that's enough,\" said Mrs Bellingham, sharply, for the maid's\nchattering had outrun her tact; and in her anxiety to vindicate the\ncharacter of her friend Mrs Mason by blackening that of Ruth, she had\nforgotten that she a little implicated her mistress's son, whom his\nproud mother did not like to imagine as ever passing through a low\nand degraded part of the town.\n\n\"If she has no friends, and is the creature you describe (which is\nconfirmed by my own observation), the best place for her is, as I\nsaid before, the Penitentiary. Her fifty pounds will keep her for\na week or so, if she is really unable to travel, and pay for her\njourney; and if on her return to Fordham she will let me know, I will\nundertake to obtain her admission immediately.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it's well for her she has to do with a lady who will take\nany interest in her, after what has happened.\"\n\nMrs Bellingham called for her writing-desk, and wrote a few hasty\nlines to be sent back by the post-boy, who was on the point of\nstarting:\n\n\n   Mrs Bellingham presents her compliments to her unknown\n   correspondent, Mr Benson, and begs to inform him of a\n   circumstance of which she believes he was ignorant when he\n   wrote the letter with which she has been favoured; namely,\n   that provision to the amount of \u00c2\u00a350 was left for the\n   unfortunate young person who is the subject of Mr Benson's\n   letter. This sum is in the hands of Mrs Morgan, as well as\n   a note from Mrs Bellingham to the miserable girl, in which\n   she proposes to procure her admission into the Fordham\n   Penitentiary, the best place for such a character, as by\n   this profligate action she has forfeited the only friend\n   remaining to her in the world. This proposition, Mrs\n   Bellingham repeats; and they are the young woman's best\n   friends who most urge her to comply with the course now\n   pointed out.\n\n\n\"Take care Mr Bellingham hears nothing of this Mr Benson's note,\"\nsaid Mrs Bellingham, as she delivered the answer to her maid; \"he is\nso sensitive just now that it would annoy him sadly, I am sure.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThurstan and Faith Benson\n\n\nYou have now seen the note which was delivered into Mr Benson's\nhands, as the cool shades of evening stole over the glowing summer\nsky. When he had read it, he again prepared to write a few hasty\nlines before the post went out. The post-boy was even now sounding\nhis horn through the village as a signal for letters to be ready; and\nit was well that Mr Benson, in his long morning's meditation, had\ndecided upon the course to be pursued, in case of such an answer as\nthat which he had received from Mrs Bellingham. His present note was\nas follows:\n\n\n   DEAR FAITH,--You must come to this place directly, where I\n   earnestly desire you and your advice. I am well myself, so\n   do not be alarmed. I have no time for explanation, but I\n   am sure you will not refuse me; let me trust that I shall\n   see you on Saturday at the latest. You know the mode by\n   which I came; it is the best for expedition and cheapness.\n   Dear Faith, do not fail me.\n\n   Your affectionate brother,\n\n   THURSTAN BENSON.\n\n   P.S.--I am afraid the money I left may be running short.\n   Do not let this stop you. Take my Facciolati to Johnson's,\n   he will advance upon it; it is the third row, bottom\n   shelf. Only come.\n\n\nWhen this letter was despatched he had done all he could; and the\nnext two days passed like a long monotonous dream of watching,\nthought, and care, undisturbed by any event, hardly by the change\nfrom day to night, which, now the harvest moon was at her full, was\nscarcely perceptible. On Saturday morning the answer came.\n\n\n   DEAREST THURSTAN,--Your incomprehensible summons has just\n   reached me, and I obey, thereby proving my right to my\n   name of Faith. I shall be with you almost as soon as this\n   letter. I cannot help feeling anxious, as well as curious.\n   I have money enough, and it is well I have; for Sally, who\n   guards your room like a dragon, would rather see me walk\n   the whole way, than have any of your things disturbed.\n\n   Your affectionate sister,\n\n   FAITH BENSON.\n\n\nIt was a great relief to Mr Benson to think that his sister would so\nsoon be with him. He had been accustomed from childhood to rely on\nher prompt judgment and excellent sense; and to her care he felt that\nRuth ought to be consigned, as it was too much to go on taxing good\nMrs Hughes with night watching and sick nursing, with all her other\nclaims on her time. He asked her once more to sit by Ruth, while he\nwent to meet his sister.\n\nThe coach passed by the foot of the steep ascent which led up to\nLlan-dhu. He took a boy to carry his sister's luggage when she\narrived; they were too soon at the bottom of the hill, and the boy\nbegan to make ducks and drakes in the shallowest part of the stream,\nwhich there flowed glassy and smooth, while Mr Benson sat down on a\ngreat stone, under the shadow of an alder bush which grew where the\ngreen, flat meadow skirted the water. It was delightful to be once\nmore in the open air, and away from the scenes and thoughts which had\nbeen pressing on him for the last three days. There was new beauty in\neverything: from the blue mountains which glimmered in the distant\nsunlight, down to the flat, rich, peaceful vale, with its calm round\nshadows, where he sat. The very margin of white pebbles which lay on\nthe banks of the stream had a sort of cleanly beauty about it. He\nfelt calmer and more at ease than he had done for some days; and yet,\nwhen he began to think, it was rather a strange story which he had to\ntell his sister, in order to account for his urgent summons. Here was\nhe, sole friend and guardian of a poor sick girl, whose very name he\ndid not know; about whom all that he did know was, that she had been\nthe mistress of a man who had deserted her, and that he feared--he\nbelieved--she had contemplated suicide. The offence, too, was one for\nwhich his sister, good and kind as she was, had little compassion.\nWell, he must appeal to her love for him, which was a very\nunsatisfactory mode of proceeding, as he would far rather have had\nher interest in the girl founded on reason, or some less personal\nbasis than showing it merely because her brother wished it.\n\nThe coach came slowly rumbling over the stony road. His sister was\noutside, but got down in a brisk active way, and greeted her brother\nheartily and affectionately. She was considerably taller than he was,\nand must have been very handsome; her black hair was parted plainly\nover her forehead, and her dark, expressive eyes and straight nose\nstill retained the beauty of her youth. I do not know whether she\nwas older than her brother, but, probably owing to his infirmity\nrequiring her care, she had something of a mother's manner towards\nhim.\n\n\"Thurstan, you are looking pale! I do not believe you are well,\nwhatever you may say. Have you had the old pain in your back?\"\n\n\"No--a little--never mind that, dearest Faith. Sit down here, while\nI send the boy up with your box.\" And then, with some little desire\nto show his sister how well he was acquainted with the language,\nhe blundered out his directions in very grammatical Welsh; so\ngrammatical, in fact, and so badly pronounced, that the boy,\nscratching his head, made answer,\n\n\"Dim Saesoneg.\"\n\nSo he had to repeat it in English.\n\n\"Well now, Thurstan, here I sit as you bid me. But don't try me too\nlong; tell me why you sent for me.\"\n\nNow came the difficulty, and oh! for a seraph's tongue, and a\nseraph's powers of representation! but there was no seraph at hand,\nonly the soft running waters singing a quiet tune, and predisposing\nMiss Benson to listen with a soothed spirit to any tale, not\nimmediately involving her brother's welfare, which had been the cause\nof her seeing that lovely vale.\n\n\"It is an awkward story to tell, Faith, but there is a young woman\nlying ill at my lodgings whom I wanted you to nurse.\"\n\nHe thought he saw a shadow on his sister's face, and detected a\nslight change in her voice as she spoke.\n\n\"Nothing very romantic, I hope, Thurstan. Remember, I cannot stand\nmuch romance; I always distrust it.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by romance. The story is real enough, and\nnot out of the common way, I'm afraid.\"\n\nHe paused; he did not get over the difficulty.\n\n\"Well, tell it me at once, Thurstan. I am afraid you have let some\none, or perhaps only your own imagination, impose upon you; but don't\ntry my patience too much; you know I've no great stock.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you. The young girl was brought to the inn here by a\ngentleman, who has left her; she is very ill, and has no one to see\nafter her.\"\n\nMiss Benson had some masculine tricks, and one was whistling a long,\nlow whistle when surprised or displeased. She had often found it a\nuseful vent for feelings, and she whistled now. Her brother would\nrather she had spoken.\n\n\"Have you sent for her friends?\" she asked at last.\n\n\"She has none.\"\n\nAnother pause and another whistle, but rather softer and more\nwavering than the last.\n\n\"How is she ill?\"\n\n\"Pretty nearly as quiet as if she were dead. She does not speak, or\nmove, or even sigh.\"\n\n\"It would be better for her to die at once, I think.\"\n\n\"Faith!\"\n\nThat one word put them right. It was spoken in the tone which had\nauthority over her; it was so full of grieved surprise and mournful\nupbraiding. She was accustomed to exercise a sway over him, owing to\nher greater decision of character, and, probably, if everything were\ntraced to its cause, to her superior vigour of constitution; but at\ntimes she was humbled before his pure, childlike nature, and felt\nwhere she was inferior. She was too good and true to conceal this\nfeeling, or to resent its being forced upon her. After a time she\nsaid,\n\n\"Thurstan, dear, let us go to her.\"\n\nShe helped him with tender care, and gave him her arm up the long and\ntedious hill; but when they approached the village, without speaking\na word on the subject, they changed their position, and she leant\n(apparently) on him. He stretched himself up into as vigorous a gait\nas he could, when they drew near to the abodes of men.\n\nOn the way they had spoken but little. He had asked after various\nmembers of his congregation, for he was a Dissenting minister in a\ncountry town, and she had answered; but they neither of them spoke of\nRuth, though their minds were full of her.\n\nMrs Hughes had tea ready for the traveller on her arrival. Mr Benson\nchafed a little internally at the leisurely way in which his sister\nsipped and sipped, and paused to tell him some trifling particular\nrespecting home affairs, which she had forgotten before.\n\n\"Mr Bradshaw has refused to let the children associate with the\nDixons any longer, because one evening they played at acting\ncharades.\"\n\n\"Indeed;--a little more bread and butter, Faith?\"\n\n\"Thank you. This Welsh air does make one hungry. Mrs Bradshaw is\npaying poor old Maggie's rent, to save her from being sent into the\nworkhouse.\"\n\n\"That's right. Won't you have another cup of tea?\"\n\n\"I have had two. However, I think I'll take another.\"\n\nMr Benson could not refrain from a little sigh as he poured it out.\nHe thought he had never seen his sister so deliberately hungry and\nthirsty before. He did not guess that she was feeling the meal rather\na respite from a distasteful interview, which she was aware was\nawaiting her at its conclusion. But all things come to an end, and so\ndid Miss Benson's tea.\n\n\"Now, will you go and see her?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAnd so they went. Mrs Hughes had pinned up a piece of green calico,\nby way of a Venetian blind, to shut out the afternoon sun; and in the\nlight thus shaded lay Ruth, still, and wan, and white. Even with her\nbrother's account of Ruth's state, such death-like quietness startled\nMiss Benson--startled her into pity for the poor lovely creature who\nlay thus stricken and felled. When she saw her, she could no longer\nimagine her to be an impostor, or a hardened sinner; such prostration\nof woe belonged to neither. Mr Benson looked more at his sister's\nface than at Ruth's; he read her countenance as a book.\n\nMrs Hughes stood by, crying.\n\nMr Benson touched his sister, and they left the room together.\n\n\"Do you think she will live?\" asked he.\n\n\"I cannot tell,\" said Miss Benson, in a softened voice. \"But how\nyoung she looks! Quite a child, poor creature! When will the doctor\ncome, Thurstan? Tell me all about her; you have never told me the\nparticulars.\"\n\nMr Benson might have said, she had never cared to hear them before,\nand had rather avoided the subject; but he was too happy to see this\nawakening of interest in his sister's warm heart to say anything in\nthe least reproachful. He told her the story as well as he could;\nand, as he felt it deeply, he told it with heart's eloquence; and, as\nhe ended and looked at her, there were tears in the eyes of both.\n\n\"And what does the doctor say?\" asked she, after a pause.\n\n\"He insists upon quiet; he orders medicines and strong broth. I\ncannot tell you all; Mrs Hughes can. She has been so truly good.\n'Doing good, hoping for nothing again.'\"\n\n\"She looks very sweet and gentle. I shall sit up to-night and watch\nher myself; and I shall send you and Mrs Hughes early to bed, for you\nhave both a worn look about you I don't like. Are you sure the effect\nof that fall has gone off? Do you feel anything of it in your back\nstill? After all, I owe her something for turning back to your help.\nAre you sure she was going to drown herself?\"\n\n\"I cannot be sure, for I have not questioned her. She has not been in\na state to be questioned; but I have no doubt whatever about it. But\nyou must not think of sitting up after your journey, Faith.\"\n\n\"Answer me, Thurstan. Do you feel any bad effect from that fall?\"\n\n\"No, hardly any. Don't sit up, Faith, to-night!\"\n\n\"Thurstan, it's no use talking, for I shall; and, if you go on\nopposing me, I dare say I shall attack your back, and put a blister\non it. Do tell me what that 'hardly any' means. Besides, to set you\nquite at ease, you know I have never seen mountains before, and they\nfill me and oppress me so much that I could not sleep; I must keep\nawake this first night, and see that they don't fall on the earth and\noverwhelm it. And now answer my questions about yourself.\"\n\nMiss Benson had the power, which some people have, of carrying her\nwishes through to their fulfilment; her will was strong, her sense\nwas excellent, and people yielded to her--they did not know why.\nBefore ten o'clock she reigned sole power and potentate in Ruth's\nlittle chamber. Nothing could have been better devised for giving her\nan interest in the invalid. The very dependence of one so helpless\nupon her care inclined her heart towards her. She thought she\nperceived a slight improvement in the symptoms during the night, and\nshe was a little pleased that this progress should have been made\nwhile she reigned monarch of the sick-room. Yes, certainly there was\nan improvement. There was more consciousness in the look of the eyes,\nalthough the whole countenance still retained its painful traces of\nacute suffering, manifested in an anxious, startled, uneasy aspect.\nIt was broad morning light, though barely five o'clock, when Miss\nBenson caught the sight of Ruth's lips moving, as if in speech. Miss\nBenson stooped down to listen.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Ruth, in the faintest of whispers.\n\n\"Miss Benson--Mr Benson's sister,\" she replied.\n\nThe words conveyed no knowledge to Ruth; on the contrary, weak as a\nbabe in mind and body as she was, her lips began to quiver, and her\neyes to show a terror similar to that of any little child who wakens\nin the presence of a stranger, and sees no dear, familiar face of\nmother or nurse to reassure its trembling heart.\n\nMiss Benson took her hand in hers, and began to stroke it\ncaressingly.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, dear; I'm a friend come to take care of you. Would\nyou like some tea now, my love?\"\n\nThe very utterance of these gentle words was unlocking Miss Benson's\nheart. Her brother was surprised to see her so full of interest, when\nhe came to inquire later on in the morning. It required Mrs Hughes's\npersuasions, as well as his own, to induce her to go to bed for an\nhour or two after breakfast; and, before she went, she made them\npromise that she should be called when the doctor came. He did not\ncome until late in the afternoon. The invalid was rallying fast,\nthough rallying to a consciousness of sorrow, as was evinced by the\ntears which came slowly rolling down her pale sad cheeks--tears which\nshe had not the power to wipe away.\n\nMr Benson had remained in the house all day to hear the doctor's\nopinion; and now that he was relieved from the charge of Ruth by\nhis sister's presence, he had the more time to dwell upon the\ncircumstances of her case--so far as they were known to him. He\nremembered his first sight of her; her little figure swaying to and\nfro as she balanced herself on the slippery stones, half smiling at\nher own dilemma, with a bright, happy light in the eyes that seemed\nlike a reflection from the glancing waters sparkling below. Then he\nrecalled the changed, affrighted look of those eyes as they met his,\nafter the child's rebuff of her advances;--how that little incident\nfilled up the tale at which Mrs Hughes had hinted, in a kind of\nsorrowful way, as if loath (as a Christian should be) to believe\nevil. Then that fearful evening, when he had only just saved her\nfrom committing suicide, and that nightmare sleep! And now, lost,\nforsaken, and but just delivered from the jaws of death, she lay\ndependent for everything on his sister and him,--utter strangers a\nfew weeks ago. Where was her lover? Could he be easy and happy? Could\nhe grow into perfect health, with these great sins pressing on his\nconscience with a strong and hard pain? Or had he a conscience?\n\nInto whole labyrinths of social ethics Mr Benson's thoughts wandered,\nwhen his sister entered suddenly and abruptly.\n\n\"What does the doctor say? Is she better?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! she's better,\" answered Miss Benson, sharp and short. Her\nbrother looked at her in dismay. She bumped down into a chair in a\ncross, disconcerted manner. They were both silent for a few minutes;\nonly Miss Benson whistled and clucked alternately.\n\n\"What is the matter, Faith? You say she is better.\"\n\n\"Why, Thurstan, there is something so shocking the matter, that I\ncannot tell you.\"\n\nMr Benson changed colour with affright. All things possible and\nimpossible crossed his mind but the right one. I said, \"all things\npossible;\" I made a mistake. He never believed Ruth to be more guilty\nthan she seemed.\n\n\"Faith, I wish you would tell me, and not bewilder me with those\nnoises of yours,\" said he, nervously.\n\n\"I beg your pardon; but something so shocking has just been\ndiscovered--I don't know how to word it--She will have a child. The\ndoctor says so.\"\n\nShe was allowed to make noises unnoticed for a few minutes. Her\nbrother did not speak. At last she wanted his sympathy.\n\n\"Isn't it shocking, Thurstan? You might have knocked me down with a\nstraw when he told me.\"\n\n\"Does she know?\"\n\n\"Yes; and I am not sure that that isn't the worst part of all.\"\n\n\"How?--what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh! I was just beginning to have a good opinion of her, but I'm\nafraid she is very depraved. After the doctor was gone, she pulled\nthe bed-curtain aside, and looked as if she wanted to speak to me. (I\ncan't think how she heard, for we were close to the window, and spoke\nvery low.) Well, I went to her, though I really had taken quite a\nturn against her. And she whispered, quite eagerly, 'Did he say I\nshould have a baby?' Of course, I could not keep it from her; but I\nthought it my duty to look as cold and severe as I could. She did not\nseem to understand how it ought to be viewed, but took it just as if\nshe had a right to have a baby. She said, 'Oh, my God, I thank Thee!\nOh! I will be so good!' I had no patience with her then, so I left\nthe room.\"\n\n\"Who is with her?\"\n\n\"Mrs Hughes. She is not seeing the thing in a moral light, as I\nshould have expected.\"\n\nMr Benson was silent again. After some time he began:\n\n\"Faith, I don't see this affair quite as you do. I believe I am\nright.\"\n\n\"You surprise me, brother! I don't understand you.\"\n\n\"Wait awhile! I want to make my feelings very clear to you, but I\ndon't know where to begin, or how to express myself.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed, an extraordinary subject for us to have to talk\nabout; but if once I get clear of this girl, I'll wash my hands of\nall such cases again.\"\n\nHer brother was not attending to her; he was reducing his own ideas\nto form.\n\n\"Faith, do you know I rejoice in this child's advent?\"\n\n\"May God forgive you, Thurstan!--if you know what you are saying.\nBut, surely, it is a temptation, dear Thurstan.\"\n\n\"I do not think it is a delusion. The sin appears to me to be quite\ndistinct from its consequences.\"\n\n\"Sophistry--and a temptation,\" said Miss Benson, decidedly.\n\n\"No, it is not,\" said her brother, with equal decision. \"In the eye\nof God, she is exactly the same as if the life she has led had left\nno trace behind. We knew her errors before, Faith.\"\n\n\"Yes, but not this disgrace--this badge of her shame!\"\n\n\"Faith, Faith! let me beg of you not to speak so of the little\ninnocent babe, who may be God's messenger to lead her back to Him.\nThink again of her first words--the burst of nature from her heart!\nDid she not turn to God, and enter into a covenant with Him--'I\nwill be so good?' Why, it draws her out of herself! If her life has\nhitherto been self-seeking, and wickedly thoughtless, here is the\nvery instrument to make her forget herself, and be thoughtful for\nanother. Teach her (and God will teach her, if man does not come\nbetween) to reverence her child; and this reverence will shut out\nsin,--will be purification.\"\n\nHe was very much excited; he was even surprised at his own\nexcitement; but his thoughts and meditations through the long\nafternoon had prepared his mind for this manner of viewing the\nsubject.\n\n\"These are quite new ideas to me,\" said Miss Benson, coldly. \"I think\nyou, Thurstan, are the first person I ever heard rejoicing over the\nbirth of an illegitimate child. It appears to me, I must own, rather\nquestionable morality.\"\n\n\"I do not rejoice. I have been all this afternoon mourning over the\nsin which has blighted this young creature; I have been dreading\nlest, as she recovered consciousness, there should be a return of her\ndespair. I have been thinking of every holy word, every promise to\nthe penitent--of the tenderness which led the Magdalen aright. I have\nbeen feeling, severely and reproachfully, the timidity which has\nhitherto made me blink all encounter with evils of this particular\nkind. Oh, Faith! once for all, do not accuse me of questionable\nmorality, when I am trying more than ever I did in my life to act as\nmy blessed Lord would have done.\"\n\nHe was very much agitated. His sister hesitated, and then she spoke\nmore softly than before.\n\n\"But, Thurstan, everything might have been done to 'lead her right'\n(as you call it), without this child, this miserable offspring of\nsin.\"\n\n\"The world has, indeed, made such children miserable, innocent as\nthey are; but I doubt if this be according to the will of God, unless\nit be His punishment for the parents' guilt; and even then the\nworld's way of treatment is too apt to harden the mother's natural\nlove into something like hatred. Shame, and the terror of friends'\ndispleasure, turn her mad--defile her holiest instincts; and, as for\nthe fathers--God forgive them! I cannot--at least, not just now.\"\n\nMiss Benson thought on what her brother said. At length she asked,\n\"Thurstan (remember I'm not convinced), how would you have this girl\ntreated according to your theory?\"\n\n\"It will require some time, and much Christian love, to find out the\nbest way. I know I'm not very wise; but the way I think it would be\nright to act in, would be this--\" He thought for some time before he\nspoke, and then said:\n\n\"She has incurred a responsibility--that we both acknowledge. She is\nabout to become a mother, and have the direction and guidance of a\nlittle tender life. I fancy such a responsibility must be serious and\nsolemn enough, without making it into a heavy and oppressive burden,\nso that human nature recoils from bearing it. While we do all we can\nto strengthen her sense of responsibility, I would likewise do all we\ncan to make her feel that it is responsibility for what may become a\nblessing.\"\n\n\"Whether the children are legitimate or illegitimate?\" asked Miss\nBenson, drily.\n\n\"Yes!\" said her brother, firmly. \"The more I think, the more I\nbelieve I am right. No one,\" said he, blushing faintly as he spoke,\n\"can have a greater recoil from profligacy than I have. You yourself\nhave not greater sorrow over this young creature's sin than I have:\nthe difference is this, you confuse the consequences with the sin.\"\n\n\"I don't understand metaphysics.\"\n\n\"I am not aware that I am talking metaphysics. I can imagine that if\nthe present occasion be taken rightly, and used well, all that is\ngood in her may be raised to a height unmeasured but by God; while\nall that is evil and dark may, by His blessing, fade and disappear\nin the pure light of her child's presence. Oh, Father! listen to my\nprayer, that her redemption may date from this time. Help us to speak\nto her in the loving spirit of thy Holy Son!\"\n\nThe tears were full in his eyes; he almost trembled in his\nearnestness. He was faint with the strong power of his own\nconviction, and with his inability to move his sister. But she was\nshaken. She sat very still for a quarter of an hour or more, while he\nleaned back, exhausted by his own feelings.\n\n\"The poor child!\" said she, at length--\"the poor, poor child! what\nit will have to struggle through and endure! Do you remember Thomas\nWilkins, and the way he threw the registry of his birth and baptism\nback in your face? Why, he would not have the situation; he went to\nsea and was drowned, rather than present the record of his shame.\"\n\n\"I do remember it all. It has often haunted me. She must strengthen\nher child to look to God, rather than to man's opinion. It will be\nthe discipline, the penance, she has incurred. She must teach it to\nbe (humanly speaking) self-dependent.\"\n\n\"But after all,\" said Miss Benson (for she had known and esteemed\npoor Thomas Wilkins, and had mourned over his untimely death, and\nthe recollection thereof softened her)--\"after all, it might be\nconcealed. The very child need never know its illegitimacy.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked her brother.\n\n\"Why--we know so little about her yet; but in that letter, it said\nshe had no friends;--now, could she not go into quite a fresh place,\nand be passed off as a widow?\"\n\nAh, tempter! unconscious tempter! Here was a way of evading the\ntrials for the poor little unborn child, of which Mr Benson had never\nthought. It was the decision--the pivot, on which the fate of years\nmoved; and he turned it the wrong way. But it was not for his own\nsake. For himself, he was brave enough to tell the truth; for the\nlittle helpless baby, about to enter a cruel, biting world, he was\ntempted to evade the difficulty. He forgot what he had just said, of\nthe discipline and penance to the mother consisting in strengthening\nher child to meet, trustfully and bravely, the consequences of her\nown weakness. He remembered more clearly the wild fierceness, the\nCain-like look, of Thomas Wilkins, as the obnoxious word in the\nbaptismal registry told him that he must go forth branded into the\nworld, with his hand against every man's, and every man's against\nhim.\n\n\"How could it be managed, Faith?\"\n\n\"Nay, I must know much more, which she alone can tell us, before I\ncan see how it is to be managed. It is certainly the best plan.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is,\" said her brother, thoughtfully, but no longer\nclearly or decidedly; and so the conversation dropped.\n\nRuth moved the bed-curtain aside, in her soft manner, when Miss\nBenson re-entered the room; she did not speak, but she looked at her\nas if she wished her to come near. Miss Benson went and stood by her.\nRuth took her hand in hers and kissed it; then, as if fatigued even\nby this slight movement, she fell asleep.\n\nMiss Benson took up her work, and thought over her brother's\nspeeches. She was not convinced, but she was softened and bewildered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nLosing Sight of the Welsh Mountains\n\n\nMiss Benson continued in an undecided state of mind for the two next\ndays; but on the third, as they sat at breakfast, she began to speak\nto her brother.\n\n\"That young creature's name is Ruth Hilton.\"\n\n\"Indeed! how did you find it out?\"\n\n\"From herself, of course. She is much stronger. I slept with her last\nnight, and I was aware she was awake long before I liked to speak,\nbut at last I began. I don't know what I said, or how it went on,\nbut I think it was a little relief to her to tell me something about\nherself. She sobbed and cried herself to sleep; I think she is asleep\nnow.\"\n\n\"Tell me what she said about herself.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was really very little; it was evidently a most painful\nsubject. She is an orphan, without brother or sister, and with\na guardian, whom, I think she said, she never saw but once. He\napprenticed her (after her father's death) to a dressmaker. This Mr\nBellingham got acquainted with her, and they used to meet on Sunday\nafternoons. One day they were late, lingering on the road, when the\ndressmaker came up by accident. She seems to have been very angry,\nand not unnaturally so. The girl took fright at her threats, and the\nlover persuaded her to go off with him to London, there and then.\nLast May, I think it was. That's all.\"\n\n\"Did she express any sorrow for her error?\"\n\n\"No, not in words, but her voice was broken with sobs, though she\ntried to make it steady. After a while she began to talk about her\nbaby, but shyly, and with much hesitation. She asked me how much I\nthought she could earn as a dressmaker, by working very, very hard;\nand that brought us round to her child. I thought of what you had\nsaid, Thurstan, and I tried to speak to her as you wished me. I am\nnot sure if it was right; I am doubtful in my own mind still.\"\n\n\"Don't be doubtful, Faith! Dear Faith, I thank you for your\nkindness.\"\n\n\"There is really nothing to thank me for. It is almost impossible to\nhelp being kind to her; there is something so meek and gentle about\nher, so patient, and so grateful!\"\n\n\"What does she think of doing?\"\n\n\"Poor child! she thinks of taking lodgings--very cheap ones, she\nsays; there she means to work night and day to earn enough for her\nchild. For, she said to me, with such pretty earnestness, 'It must\nnever know want, whatever I do. I have deserved suffering, but it\nwill be such a little innocent darling!' Her utmost earnings would\nnot be more than seven or eight shillings a week, I'm afraid; and\nthen she is so young and so pretty!\"\n\n\"There is that fifty pounds Mrs Morgan brought me, and those two\nletters. Does she know about them yet?\"\n\n\"No; I did not like to tell her till she is a little stronger. Oh,\nThurstan! I wish there was not this prospect of a child. I cannot\nhelp it. I do--I could see a way in which we might help her, if it\nwere not for that.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's no use thinking of it, as it is! Or else we might have\ntaken her home with us, and kept her till she had got a little\ndress-making in the congregation, but for this meddlesome child;\nthat spoils everything. You must let me grumble to you, Thurstan.\nI was very good to her, and spoke as tenderly and respectfully of\nthe little thing as if it were the Queen's, and born in lawful\nmatrimony.\"\n\n\"That's right, my dear Faith! Grumble away to me, if you like. I'll\nforgive you, for the kind thought of taking her home with us. But do\nyou think her situation is an insuperable objection?\"\n\n\"Why, Thurstan!--it's so insuperable, it puts it quite out of the\nquestion.\"\n\n\"How?--that's only repeating your objection. Why is it out of the\nquestion?\"\n\n\"If there had been no child coming, we might have called her by her\nright name--Miss Hilton; that's one thing. Then, another is, the baby\nin our house. Why, Sally would go distraught!\"\n\n\"Never mind Sally. If she were an orphan relation of our own, left\nwidowed,\" said he, pausing, as if in doubt. \"You yourself suggested\nshe should be considered as a widow, for the child's sake. I'm only\ntaking up your ideas, dear Faith. I respect you for thinking of\ntaking her home; it is just what we ought to do. Thank you for\nreminding me of my duty.\"\n\n\"Nay, it was only a passing thought. Think of Mr Bradshaw. Oh! I\ntremble at the thought of his grim displeasure.\"\n\n\"We must think of a higher than Mr Bradshaw. I own I should be a very\ncoward, if he knew. He is so severe, so inflexible. But after all he\nsees so little of us; he never comes to tea, you know, but is always\nengaged when Mrs Bradshaw comes. I don't think he knows of what our\nhousehold consists.\"\n\n\"Not know Sally? Oh yes, but he does. He asked Mrs Bradshaw one day,\nif she knew what wages we gave her, and said we might get a far more\nefficient and younger servant for the money. And, speaking about\nmoney, think what our expenses would be if we took her home for the\nnext six months.\"\n\nThat consideration was a puzzling one; and both sat silent and\nperplexed for a time. Miss Benson was as sorrowful as her brother,\nfor she was becoming as anxious as he was to find it possible that\nher plan could be carried out.\n\n\"There's the fifty pounds,\" said he, with a sigh of reluctance at the\nidea.\n\n\"Yes, there's the fifty pounds,\" echoed his sister, with the same\nsadness in her tone. \"I suppose it is hers.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is; and being so, we must not think who gave it to her.\nIt will defray her expenses. I am very sorry, but I think we must\ntake it.\"\n\n\"It would never do to apply to him under the present circumstances,\"\nsaid Miss Benson, in a hesitating manner.\n\n\"No, that we won't,\" said her brother, decisively. \"If she consents\nto let us take care of her, we will never let her stoop to request\nanything from him, even for his child. She can live on bread and\nwater. We can all live on bread and water rather than that.\"\n\n\"Then I will speak to her and propose the plan. Oh, Thurstan! from\na child you could persuade me to anything! I hope I am doing right.\nHowever much I oppose you at first, I am sure to yield soon; almost\nin proportion to my violence at first. I think I am very weak.\"\n\n\"No, not in this instance. We are both right: I, in the way in which\nthe child ought to be viewed; you, dear good Faith, for thinking of\ntaking her home with us. God bless you, dear, for it!\"\n\nWhen Ruth began to sit up (and the strange, new, delicious prospect\nof becoming a mother seemed to give her some mysterious source of\nstrength, so that her recovery was rapid and swift from that time),\nMiss Benson brought her the letters and the bank-note.\n\n\"Do you recollect receiving this letter, Ruth?\" asked she, with\ngrave gentleness. Ruth changed colour, and took it and read it again\nwithout making any reply to Miss Benson. Then she sighed, and thought\na while; and then took up and read the second note--the note which\nMrs Bellingham had sent to Mr Benson in answer to his. After that she\ntook up the bank-note and turned it round and round, but not as if\nshe saw it. Miss Benson noticed that her fingers trembled sadly, and\nthat her lips were quivering for some time before she spoke.\n\n\"If you please, Miss Benson, I should like to return this money.\"\n\n\"Why, my dear?\"\n\n\"I have a strong feeling against taking it. While he,\" said she,\ndeeply blushing, and letting her large white lids drop down and veil\nher eyes, \"loved me, he gave me many things--my watch--oh, many\nthings; and I took them from him gladly and thankfully because he\nloved me--for I would have given him anything--and I thought of them\nas signs of love. But this money pains my heart. He has left off\nloving me, and has gone away. This money seems--oh, Miss Benson--it\nseems as if he could comfort me, for being forsaken, by money.\" And\nat that word the tears, so long kept back and repressed, forced their\nway like rain.\n\nShe checked herself, however, in the violence of her emotion, for she\nthought of her child.\n\n\"So, will you take the trouble of sending it back to Mrs Bellingham?\"\n\n\"That I will, my dear. I am glad of it, that I am! They don't deserve\nto have the power of giving: they don't deserve that you should take\nit.\"\n\nMiss Benson went and enclosed it up, there and then; simply writing\nthese words in the envelope, \"From Ruth Hilton.\"\n\n\"And now we wash our hands of these Bellinghams,\" said she,\ntriumphantly. But Ruth looked tearful and sad; not about returning\nthe note, but from the conviction that the reason she had given for\nthe ground of her determination was true--he no longer loved her.\n\nTo cheer her, Miss Benson began to speak of the future. Miss Benson\nwas one of those people who, the more she spoke of a plan in its\ndetails, and the more she realised it in her own mind, the more\nfirmly she became a partisan of the project. Thus she grew warm and\nhappy in the idea of taking Ruth home; but Ruth remained depressed\nand languid under the conviction that he no longer loved her. No\nhome, no future, but the thought of her child, could wean her\nfrom this sorrow. Miss Benson was a little piqued; and this pique\nshowed itself afterwards in talking to her brother of the morning's\nproceedings in the sick-chamber.\n\n\"I admired her at the time for sending away her fifty pounds so\nproudly; but I think she has a cold heart: she hardly thanked me at\nall for my proposal of taking her home with us.\"\n\n\"Her thoughts are full of other things just now; and people have such\ndifferent ways of showing feeling: some by silence, some by words. At\nany rate, it is unwise to expect gratitude.\"\n\n\"What do you expect--not indifference or ingratitude?\"\n\n\"It is better not to expect or calculate consequences. The longer\nI live, the more fully I see that. Let us try simply to do right\nactions, without thinking of the feelings they are to call out in\nothers. We know that no holy or self-denying effort can fall to the\nground vain and useless; but the sweep of eternity is large, and God\nalone knows when the effect is to be produced. We are trying to do\nright now, and to feel right; don't let us perplex ourselves with\nendeavouring to map out how she should feel, or how she should show\nher feelings.\"\n\n\"That's all very fine, and I dare say very true,\" said Miss Benson, a\nlittle chagrined. \"But 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush;'\nand I would rather have had one good, hearty 'Thank you,' now, for\nall I have been planning to do for her, than the grand effects you\npromise me in the 'sweep of eternity.' Don't be grave and sorrowful,\nThurstan, or I'll go out of the room. I can stand Sally's scoldings,\nbut I can't bear your look of quiet depression whenever I am a little\nhasty or impatient. I had rather you would give me a good box on the\near.\"\n\n\"And I would often rather you would speak, if ever so hastily,\ninstead of whistling. So, if I box your ears when I am vexed with\nyou, will you promise to scold me when you are put out of the way,\ninstead of whistling?\"\n\n\"Very well! that's a bargain. You box, and I scold. But, seriously,\nI began to calculate our money when she so cavalierly sent off the\nfifty-pound note (I can't help admiring her for it), and I am very\nmuch afraid we shall not have enough to pay the doctor's bill, and\ntake her home with us.\"\n\n\"She must go inside the coach whatever we do,\" said Mr Benson,\ndecidedly. \"Who's there? Come in! Oh! Mrs Hughes! Sit down.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir, and I cannot stay; but the young lady has just made me\nfind up her watch for her, and asked me to get it sold to pay the\ndoctor, and the little things she has had since she came; and please,\nsir, indeed, I don't know where to sell it nearer than Carnarvon.\"\n\n\"That is good of her,\" said Miss Benson, her sense of justice\nsatisfied; and, remembering the way in which Ruth had spoken of the\nwatch, she felt what a sacrifice it must have been to resolve to part\nwith it.\n\n\"And her goodness just helps us out of our dilemma,\" said her\nbrother, who was unaware of the feelings with which Ruth regarded her\nwatch, or, perhaps, he might have parted with his Facciolati.\n\nMrs Hughes patiently awaited their leisure for answering her\npractical question. Where could the watch be sold? Suddenly her face\nbrightened.\n\n\"Mr Jones, the doctor, is going to be married, perhaps he would like\nnothing better than to give this pretty watch to his bride; indeed,\nand I think it's very likely; and he'll pay money for it as well as\nletting alone his bill. I'll ask him, sir, at any rate.\"\n\nMr Jones was only too glad to obtain possession of so elegant a\npresent at so cheap a rate. He even, as Mrs Hughes had foretold,\n\"paid money for it;\" more than was required to defray the expenses\nof Ruth's accommodation; as the most of the articles of food she had\nwere paid for at the time by Mr or Miss Benson, but they strictly\nforbade Mrs Hughes to tell Ruth of this.\n\n\"Would you object to my buying you a black gown?\" said Miss Benson to\nher the day after the sale of the watch. She hesitated a little, and\nthen went on:\n\n\"My brother and I think it would be better to call you--as if in fact\nyou were--a widow. It will save much awkwardness, and it will spare\nyour child much--\" Mortification she was going to have added, but\nthat word did not exactly do. But, at the mention of her child, Ruth\nstarted and turned ruby-red; as she always did when allusion was made\nto it.\n\n\"Oh, yes! certainly. Thank you much for thinking of it. Indeed,\" said\nshe, very low, as if to herself, \"I don't know how to thank you for\nall you are doing; but I do love you, and will pray for you, if I\nmay.\"\n\n\"If you may, Ruth!\" repeated Miss Benson, in a tone of surprise.\n\n\"Yes, if I may. If you will let me pray for you.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear. My dear Ruth, you don't know how often I sin; I\ndo so wrong, with my few temptations. We are both of us great sinners\nin the eyes of the Most Holy; let us pray for each other. Don't speak\nso again, my dear; at least, not to me!\"\n\nMiss Benson was actually crying. She had always looked upon herself\nas so inferior to her brother in real goodness; had seen such heights\nabove her, that she was distressed by Ruth's humility. After a short\ntime she resumed the subject.\n\n\"Then I may get you a black gown?--and we may call you Mrs Hilton?\"\n\n\"No; not Mrs Hilton!\" said Ruth, hastily.\n\nMiss Benson, who had hitherto kept her eyes averted from Ruth's face\nfrom a motive of kindly delicacy, now looked at her with surprise.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked she.\n\n\"It was my mother's name,\" said Ruth, in a low voice. \"I had better\nnot be called by it.\"\n\n\"Then, let us call you by my mother's name,\" said Miss Benson,\ntenderly. \"She would have-- But I'll talk to you about my mother some\nother time. Let me call you Mrs Denbigh. It will do very well, too.\nPeople will think you are a distant relation.\"\n\nWhen she told Mr Benson this choice of name, he was rather\nsorry; it was like his sister's impulsive kindness--impulsive in\neverything--and he could imagine how Ruth's humility had touched her.\nHe was sorry, but he said nothing.\n\nAnd now the letter was written home, announcing the probable arrival\nof the brother and sister on a certain day, \"with a distant relation,\nearly left a widow,\" as Miss Benson expressed it. She desired the\nspare room might be prepared, and made every provision she could\nthink of for Ruth's comfort; for Ruth still remained feeble and weak.\n\nWhen the black gown, at which she had stitched away incessantly,\nwas finished--when nothing remained but to rest for the next day's\njourney--Ruth could not sit still. She wandered from window to\nwindow, learning off each rock and tree by heart. Each had its tale,\nwhich it was agony to remember; but which it would have been worse\nagony to forget. The sound of running waters she heard that quiet\nevening, was in her ears as she lay on her death-bed; so well had she\nlearnt their tune.\n\nAnd now all was over. She had driven in to Llan-dhu, sitting by her\nlover's side, living in the bright present, and strangely forgetful\nof the past or the future; she had dreamed out her dream, and she had\nawakened from the vision of love. She walked slowly and sadly down\nthe long hill, her tears fast falling, but as quickly wiped away;\nwhile she strove to make steady the low quivering voice which was\noften called upon to answer some remark of Miss Benson's.\n\nThey had to wait for the coach. Ruth buried her face in some flowers\nwhich Mrs Hughes had given her on parting; and was startled when\nthe mail drew up with a sudden pull, which almost threw the horses\non their haunches. She was placed inside, and the coach had set\noff again, before she was fully aware that Mr and Miss Benson\nwere travelling on the outside; but it was a relief to feel she\nmight now cry without exciting their notice. The shadow of a heavy\nthunder-cloud was on the valley, but the little upland village church\n(that showed the spot in which so much of her life had passed) stood\nout clear in the sunshine. She grudged the tears that blinded her\nas she gazed. There was one passenger, who tried after a while to\ncomfort her.\n\n\"Don't cry, miss,\" said the kind-hearted woman. \"You're parting from\nfriends, maybe? Well, that's bad enough, but when you come to my age,\nyou'll think none of it. Why, I've three sons, and they're soldiers\nand sailors, all of them--here, there, and everywhere. One is in\nAmerica, beyond seas; another is in China, making tea; and another is\nat Gibraltar, three miles from Spain; and yet, you see, I can laugh\nand eat and enjoy myself. I sometimes think I'll try and fret a bit,\njust to make myself a better figure; but, Lord! it's no use, it's\nagainst my nature; so I laugh and grow fat again. I'd be quite\nthankful for a fit of anxiety as would make me feel easy in my\nclothes, which them manty-makers will make so tight I'm fairly\nthrottled.\"\n\nRuth durst cry no more; it was no relief, now she was watched and\nnoticed, and plied with a sandwich or a gingerbread each time she\nlooked sad. She lay back with her eyes shut, as if asleep, and went\non, and on, the sun never seeming to move from his high place in the\nsky, nor the bright hot day to show the least sign of waning. Every\nnow and then, Miss Benson scrambled down, and made kind inquiries of\nthe pale, weary Ruth; and once they changed coaches, and the fat old\nlady left her with a hearty shake of the hand.\n\n\"It is not much further now,\" said Miss Benson, apologetically, to\nRuth. \"See! we are losing sight of the Welsh mountains. We have about\neighteen miles of plain, and then we come to the moors and the rising\nground, amidst which Eccleston lies. I wish we were there, for my\nbrother is sadly tired.\"\n\nThe first wonder in Ruth's mind was, why then, if Mr Benson were so\ntired, did they not stop where they were for the night; for she knew\nlittle of the expenses of a night at an inn. The next thought was, to\nbeg that Mr Benson would take her place inside the coach, and allow\nher to mount up by Miss Benson. She proposed this, and Miss Benson\nwas evidently pleased.\n\n\"Well, if you're not tired, it would make a rest and a change for\nhim, to be sure; and if you were by me I could show you the first\nsight of Eccleston, if we reach there before it is quite dark.\"\n\nSo Mr Benson got down, and changed places with Ruth.\n\nShe hardly yet understood the numerous small economies which he and\nhis sister had to practise--the little daily self-denials,--all\nendured so cheerfully, and simply, that they had almost ceased to\nrequire an effort, and it had become natural to them to think of\nothers before themselves. Ruth had not understood that it was for\neconomy that their places had been taken on the outside of the coach,\nwhile hers, as an invalid requiring rest, was to be the inside; and\nthat the biscuits which supplied the place of a dinner were, in fact,\nchosen because the difference in price between the two would go a\nlittle way towards fulfilling their plan for receiving her as an\ninmate. Her thought about money had been hitherto a child's thought;\nthe subject had never touched her; but afterwards, when she had lived\na little with the Bensons, her eyes were opened, and she remembered\ntheir simple kindness on the journey, and treasured the remembrance\nof it in her heart.\n\nA low grey cloud was the first sign of Eccleston; it was the smoke\nof the town hanging over the plain. Beyond the place where she was\nexpected to believe it existed, arose round, waving uplands; nothing\nto the fine outlines of the Welsh mountains, but still going up\nnearer to heaven than the rest of the flat world into which she had\nnow entered. Rumbling stones, lamp-posts, a sudden stop, and they\nwere in the town of Eccleston; and a strange, uncouth voice, on the\ndark side of the coach, was heard to say,\n\n\"Be ye there, measter?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" said Miss Benson, quickly. \"Did Sally send you, Ben? Get\nthe ostler's lantern, and look out the luggage.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThe Dissenting Minister's Household\n\n\nMiss Benson had resumed every morsel of the briskness which she had\nrather lost in the middle of the day; her foot was on her native\nstones, and a very rough set they were, and she was near her home and\namong known people. Even Mr Benson spoke very cheerfully to Ben, and\nmade many inquiries of him respecting people whose names were strange\nto Ruth. She was cold, and utterly weary. She took Miss Benson's\noffered arm, and could hardly drag herself as far as the little quiet\nstreet in which Mr Benson's house was situated. The street was so\nquiet that their footsteps sounded like a loud disturbance, and\nannounced their approach as effectually as the \"trumpet's lordly\nblare\" did the coming of Abdallah. A door flew open, and a lighted\npassage stood before them. As soon as they had entered, a stout,\nelderly servant emerged from behind the door, her face radiant with\nwelcome.\n\n\"Eh, bless ye! are ye back again? I thought I should ha' been lost\nwithout ye.\"\n\nShe gave Mr Benson a hearty shake of the hand, and kissed Miss Benson\nwarmly; then, turning to Ruth, she said, in a loud whisper,\n\n\"Who's yon?\"\n\nMr Benson was silent, and walked a step onwards. Miss Benson said\nboldly out,\n\n\"The lady I named in my note, Sally--Mrs Denbigh, a distant\nrelation.\"\n\n\"Aye, but you said hoo was a widow. Is this chit a widow?\"\n\n\"Yes, this is Mrs Denbigh,\" answered Miss Benson.\n\n\"If I'd been her mother, I'd ha' given her a lollypop instead of a\nhusband. Hoo looks fitter for it.\"\n\n\"Hush! Sally, Sally! Look, there's your master trying to move that\nheavy box.\" Miss Benson calculated well when she called Sally's\nattention to her master; for it was well believed by every one, and\nby Sally herself, that his deformity was owing to a fall he had had\nwhen he was scarcely more than a baby, and entrusted to her care--a\nlittle nurse-girl, as she then was, not many years older than\nhimself. For years the poor girl had cried herself to sleep on her\npallet-bed, moaning over the blight her carelessness had brought upon\nher darling; nor was this self-reproach diminished by the forgiveness\nof the gentle mother, from whom Thurstan Benson derived so much of\nhis character. The way in which comfort stole into Sally's heart was\nin the gradually-formed resolution that she would never leave him nor\nforsake him, but serve him faithfully all her life long; and she had\nkept to her word. She loved Miss Benson, but she almost worshipped\nthe brother. The reverence for him was in her heart, however, and\ndid not always show itself in her manners. But if she scolded him\nherself, she allowed no one else that privilege. If Miss Benson\ndiffered from her brother, and ventured to think his sayings or\ndoings might have been improved, Sally came down upon her like a\nthunder-clap.\n\n\"My goodness gracious, Master Thurstan, when will you learn to leave\noff meddling with other folks' business! Here, Ben! help me up with\nthese trunks.\"\n\nThe little narrow passage was cleared, and Miss Benson took Ruth\ninto the sitting-room. There were only two sitting-rooms on the\nground-floor, one behind the other. Out of the back room the kitchen\nopened, and for this reason the back parlour was used as the family\nsitting-room; or else, being, with its garden aspect, so much\nthe pleasanter of the two, both Sally and Miss Benson would have\nappropriated it for Mr Benson's study. As it was, the front room,\nwhich looked to the street, was his room; and many a person coming\nfor help--help of which giving money was the lowest kind--was\nadmitted, and let forth by Mr Benson, unknown to any one else in the\nhouse. To make amends for his having the least cheerful room on the\nground-floor, he had the garden bedroom, while his sister slept over\nhis study. There were two more rooms again over these, with sloping\nceilings, though otherwise large and airy. The attic looking into\nthe garden was the spare bedroom; while the front belonged to\nSally. There was no room over the kitchen, which was, in fact, a\nsupplement to the house. The sitting-room was called by the pretty,\nold-fashioned name of the parlour, while Mr Benson's room was styled\nthe study.\n\nThe curtains were drawn in the parlour; there was a bright fire and a\nclean hearth; indeed, exquisite cleanliness seemed the very spirit of\nthe household, for the door which was open to the kitchen showed a\ndelicately-white and spotless floor, and bright glittering tins, on\nwhich the ruddy firelight danced.\n\nFrom the place in which Ruth sat she could see all Sally's movements;\nand though she was not conscious of close or minute observation at\nthe time (her body being weary, and her mind full of other thoughts),\nyet it was curious how faithfully that scene remained depicted on\nher memory in after years. The warm light filled every corner of the\nkitchen, in strong distinction to the faint illumination of the one\ncandle in the parlour, whose radiance was confined, and was lost in\nthe dead folds of window-curtains, carpet, and furniture. The square,\nstout, bustling figure, neat and clean in every respect, but dressed\nin the peculiar, old-fashioned costume of the county, namely, a\ndark-striped linsey-woolsey petticoat, made very short, displaying\nsturdy legs in woollen stockings beneath; a loose kind of jacket\ncalled there a \"bedgown,\" made of pink print; a snow-white apron\nand cap, both of linen, and the latter made in the shape of a\n\"mutch;\"--these articles completed Sally's costume, and were painted\non Ruth's memory. Whilst Sally was busied in preparing tea, Miss\nBenson took off Ruth's things; and the latter instinctively felt that\nSally, in the midst of her movements, was watching their proceedings.\nOccasionally she also put in a word in the conversation, and these\nlittle sentences were uttered quite in the tone of an equal, if not\nof a superior. She had dropped the more formal \"you,\" with which\nat first she had addressed Miss Benson, and thou'd her quietly and\nhabitually.\n\nAll these particulars sank unconsciously into Ruth's mind; but they\ndid not rise to the surface, and become perceptible, for a length of\ntime. She was weary, and much depressed. Even the very kindness that\nministered to her was overpowering. But over the dark, misty moor a\nlittle light shone,--a beacon; and on that she fixed her eyes, and\nstruggled out of her present deep dejection--the little child that\nwas coming to her!\n\nMr Benson was as languid and weary as Ruth, and was silent during all\nthis bustle and preparation. His silence was more grateful to Ruth\nthan Miss Benson's many words, although she felt their kindness.\nAfter tea, Miss Benson took her upstairs to her room. The white\ndimity bed, and the walls, stained green, had something of the\ncolouring and purity of effect of a snowdrop; while the floor, rubbed\nwith a mixture that turned it into a rich dark brown, suggested\nthe idea of the garden-mould out of which the snowdrop grows. As\nMiss Benson helped the pale Ruth to undress, her voice became less\nfull-toned and hurried; the hush of approaching night subdued her\ninto a softened, solemn kind of tenderness, and the murmured blessing\nsounded like granted prayer.\n\nWhen Miss Benson came downstairs, she found her brother reading\nsome letters which had been received during his absence. She went\nand softly shut the door of communication between the parlour and\nthe kitchen; and then, fetching a grey worsted stocking which\nshe was knitting, sat down near him, her eyes not looking at her\nwork but fixed on the fire; while the eternal rapid click of the\nknitting-needles broke the silence of the room, with a sound as\nmonotonous and incessant as the noise of a hand-loom. She expected\nhim to speak, but he did not. She enjoyed an examination into, and\ndiscussion of, her feelings; it was an interest and amusement to her,\nwhile he dreaded and avoided all such conversation. There were times\nwhen his feelings, which were always earnest, and sometimes morbid,\nburst forth, and defied control, and overwhelmed him; when a force\nwas upon him compelling him to speak. But he, in general, strove to\npreserve his composure, from a fear of the compelling pain of such\ntimes, and the consequent exhaustion. His heart had been very full\nof Ruth all day long, and he was afraid of his sister beginning the\nsubject; so he read on, or seemed to do so, though he hardly saw the\nletter he held before him. It was a great relief to him when Sally\nthrew open the middle door with a bang, which did not indicate either\ncalmness of mind or sweetness of temper.\n\n\"Is yon young woman going to stay any length o' time with us?\" asked\nshe of Miss Benson.\n\nMr Benson put his hand gently on his sister's arm, to check her from\nmaking any reply, while he said,\n\n\"We cannot exactly tell, Sally. She will remain until after her\nconfinement.\"\n\n\"Lord bless us and save us!--a baby in the house! Nay, then my time's\ncome, and I'll pack up and begone. I never could abide them things.\nI'd sooner have rats in the house.\"\n\nSally really did look alarmed.\n\n\"Why, Sally!\" said Mr Benson, smiling, \"I was not much more than a\nbaby when you came to take care of me.\"\n\n\"Yes, you were, Master Thurstan; you were a fine bouncing lad of\nthree year old and better.\"\n\nThen she remembered the change she had wrought in the \"fine bouncing\nlad,\" and her eyes filled with tears, which she was too proud to wipe\naway with her apron; for, as she sometimes said to herself, \"she\ncould not abide crying before folk.\"\n\n\"Well, it's no use talking, Sally,\" said Miss Benson, too anxious to\nspeak to be any longer repressed. \"We've promised to keep her, and\nwe must do it; you'll have none of the trouble, Sally, so don't be\nafraid.\"\n\n\"Well, I never! as if I minded trouble! You might ha' known me better\nnor that. I've scoured master's room twice over, just to make the\nboards look white, though the carpet is to cover them, and now you\ngo and cast up about me minding my trouble. If them's the fashions\nyou've learnt in Wales, I'm thankful I've never been there.\"\n\nSally looked red, indignant, and really hurt. Mr Benson came in with\nhis musical voice and soft words of healing.\n\n\"Faith knows you don't care for trouble, Sally; she is only anxious\nabout this poor young woman, who has no friends but ourselves. We\nknow there will be more trouble in consequence of her coming to stay\nwith us; and I think, though we never spoke about it, that in making\nour plans we reckoned on your kind help, Sally, which has never\nfailed us yet when we needed it.\"\n\n\"You've twice the sense of your sister, Master Thurstan, that you\nhave. Boys always has. It's truth there will be more trouble, and\nI shall have my share on't, I reckon. I can face it if I'm told out\nand out, but I cannot abide the way some folk has of denying there's\ntrouble or pain to be met; just as if their saying there was none,\nwould do away with it. Some folk treats one like a babby, and I don't\nlike it. I'm not meaning _you_, Master Thurstan.\"\n\n\"No, Sally, you need not say that. I know well enough who you mean\nwhen you say 'some folk.' However, I admit I was wrong in speaking as\nif you minded trouble, for there never was a creature minded it less.\nBut I want you to like Mrs Denbigh,\" said Miss Benson.\n\n\"I dare say I should, if you'd let me alone. I did na like her\nsitting down in master's chair. Set her up, indeed, in an arm-chair\nwi' cushions! Wenches in my day were glad enough of stools.\"\n\n\"She was tired to-night,\" said Mr Benson. \"We are all tired; so if\nyou have done your work, Sally, come in to reading.\"\n\nThe three quiet people knelt down side by side, and two of them\nprayed earnestly for \"them that had gone astray.\" Before ten o'clock,\nthe household were in bed.\n\nRuth, sleepless, weary, restless with the oppression of a sorrow\nwhich she dared not face and contemplate bravely, kept awake all the\nearly part of the night. Many a time did she rise, and go to the long\ncasement window, and look abroad over the still and quiet town--over\nthe grey stone walls, and chimneys, and old high-pointed roofs--on\nto the far-away hilly line of the horizon, lying calm under the\nbright moonshine. It was late in the morning when she woke from her\nlong-deferred slumbers; and when she went downstairs, she found Mr\nand Miss Benson awaiting her in the parlour. That homely, pretty,\nold-fashioned little room! How bright and still and clean it looked!\nThe window (all the windows at the back of the house were casements)\nwas open, to let in the sweet morning air, and streaming eastern\nsunshine. The long jessamine sprays, with their white-scented stars,\nforced themselves almost into the room. The little square garden\nbeyond, with grey stone walls all round, was rich and mellow in its\nautumnal colouring, running from deep crimson hollyhocks up to amber\nand gold nasturtiums, and all toned down by the clear and delicate\nair. It was so still, that the gossamer-webs, laden with dew, did not\ntremble or quiver in the least; but the sun was drawing to himself\nthe sweet incense of many flowers, and the parlour was scented with\nthe odours of mignonette and stocks. Miss Benson was arranging a\nbunch of China and damask roses in an old-fashioned jar; they lay,\nall dewy and fresh, on the white breakfast-cloth when Ruth entered.\nMr Benson was reading in some large folio. With gentle morning speech\nthey greeted her; but the quiet repose of the scene was instantly\nbroken by Sally popping in from the kitchen, and glancing at Ruth\nwith sharp reproach. She said:\n\n\"I reckon I may bring in breakfast, now?\" with a strong emphasis on\nthe last word.\n\n\"I am afraid I am very late,\" said Ruth.\n\n\"Oh, never mind,\" said Mr Benson, gently. \"It was our fault for not\ntelling you our breakfast hour. We always have prayers at half-past\nseven; and, for Sally's sake, we never vary from that time; for she\ncan so arrange her work, if she knows the hour of prayers, as to have\nher mind calm and untroubled.\"\n\n\"Ahem!\" said Miss Benson, rather inclined to \"testify\" against the\ninvariable calmness of Sally's mind at any hour of the day; but her\nbrother went on as if he did not hear her.\n\n\"But the breakfast does not signify being delayed a little; and I am\nsure you were sadly tired with your long day yesterday.\"\n\nSally came slapping in, and put down some withered, tough, dry toast,\nwith--\n\n\"It's not my doing if it is like leather;\" but as no one appeared to\nhear her, she withdrew to her kitchen, leaving Ruth's cheeks like\ncrimson at the annoyance she had caused.\n\nAll day long, she had that feeling common to those who go to stay at\na fresh house among comparative strangers: a feeling of the necessity\nthat she should become accustomed to the new atmosphere in which she\nwas placed, before she could move and act freely; it was, indeed,\na purer ether, a diviner air, which she was breathing in now,\nthan what she had been accustomed to for long months. The gentle,\nblessed mother, who had made her childhood's home holy ground, was\nin her very nature so far removed from any of earth's stains and\ntemptations, that she seemed truly one of those\n\n\n   Who ask not if Thine eye\n   Be on them; who, in love and truth,\n   Where no misgiving is, rely\n   Upon the genial sense of youth.\n\n\nIn the Bensons' house there was the same unconsciousness of\nindividual merit, the same absence of introspection and analysis of\nmotive, as there had been in her mother; but it seemed that their\nlives were pure and good, not merely from a lovely and beautiful\nnature, but from some law, the obedience to which was, of itself,\nharmonious peace, and which governed them almost implicitly, and with\nas little questioning on their part, as the glorious stars which\nhaste not, rest not, in their eternal obedience. This household had\nmany failings: they were but human, and, with all their loving desire\nto bring their lives into harmony with the will of God, they often\nerred and fell short; but, somehow, the very errors and faults of one\nindividual served to call out higher excellences in another, and so\nthey reacted upon each other, and the result of short discords was\nexceeding harmony and peace. But they had themselves no idea of the\nreal state of things; they did not trouble themselves with marking\ntheir progress by self-examination; if Mr Benson did sometimes, in\nhours of sick incapacity for exertion, turn inwards, it was to cry\naloud with almost morbid despair, \"God be merciful to me a sinner!\"\nBut he strove to leave his life in the hands of God, and to forget\nhimself.\n\nRuth sat still and quiet through the long first day. She was languid\nand weary from her journey; she was uncertain what help she might\noffer to give in the household duties, and what she might not. And,\nin her languor and in her uncertainty, it was pleasant to watch the\nnew ways of the people among whom she was placed. After breakfast,\nMr Benson withdrew to his study, Miss Benson took away the cups\nand saucers, and, leaving the kitchen door open, talked sometimes\nto Ruth, sometimes to Sally, while she washed them up. Sally had\nupstairs duties to perform, for which Ruth was thankful, as she kept\nreceiving rather angry glances for her unpunctuality as long as Sally\nremained downstairs. Miss Benson assisted in the preparation for the\nearly dinner, and brought some kidney-beans to shred into a basin of\nbright, pure spring-water, which caught and danced in the sunbeams\nas she sat near the open casement of the parlour, talking to Ruth of\nthings and people which as yet the latter did not understand, and\ncould not arrange and comprehend. She was like a child who gets a few\npieces of a dissected map, and is confused until a glimpse of the\nwhole unity is shown him. Mr and Mrs Bradshaw were the centre pieces\nin Ruth's map; their children, their servants, were the accessories;\nand one or two other names were occasionally mentioned. Ruth wondered\nand almost wearied at Miss Benson's perseverance in talking to her\nabout people whom she did not know; but, in truth, Miss Benson heard\nthe long-drawn, quivering sighs which came from the poor heavy heart,\nwhen it was left to silence, and had leisure to review the past;\nand her quick accustomed ear caught also the low mutterings of the\nthunder in the distance, in the shape of Sally's soliloquies, which,\nlike the asides at a theatre, were intended to be heard. Suddenly,\nMiss Benson called Ruth out of the room, upstairs into her own\nbed-chamber, and then began rummaging in little old-fashioned boxes,\ndrawn out of an equally old-fashioned bureau, half desk, half table,\nand wholly drawers.\n\n\"My dear, I've been very stupid and thoughtless. Oh! I'm so glad I\nthought of it before Mrs Bradshaw came to call. Here it is!\" and she\npulled out an old wedding-ring, and hurried it on Ruth's finger. Ruth\nhung down her head, and reddened deep with shame; her eyes smarted\nwith the hot tears that filled them. Miss Benson talked on, in a\nnervous hurried way:\n\n\"It was my grandmother's; it's very broad; they made them so then, to\nhold a posy inside: there's one in that;\n\n\n   Thine own sweetheart\n   Till death doth part,\n\n\nI think it is. There, there! Run away, and look as if you'd always\nworn it.\"\n\nRuth went up to her room, and threw herself down on her knees by the\nbedside, and cried as if her heart would break; and then, as if a\nlight had come down into her soul, she calmed herself and prayed--no\nwords can tell how humbly, and with what earnest feeling. When she\ncame down, she was tear-stained and wretchedly pale; but even Sally\nlooked at her with new eyes, because of the dignity with which she\nwas invested by an earnestness of purpose which had her child for its\nobject. She sat and thought, but she no longer heaved those bitter\nsighs which had wrung Miss Benson's heart in the morning. In this\nway the day wore on; early dinner, early tea, seemed to make it\npreternaturally long to Ruth; the only event was some unexplained\nabsence of Sally's, who had disappeared out of the house in the\nevening, much to Miss Benson's surprise, and somewhat to her\nindignation.\n\nAt night, after Ruth had gone up to her room, this absence was\nexplained to her at least. She had let down her long waving glossy\nhair, and was standing absorbed in thought in the middle of the room,\nwhen she heard a round clumping knock at her door, different from\nthat given by the small knuckles of delicate fingers, and in walked\nSally, with a judge-like severity of demeanour, holding in her hand\ntwo widow's caps of commonest make and coarsest texture. Queen\nEleanor herself, when she presented the bowl to Fair Rosamond, had\nnot a more relentless purpose stamped on her demeanour than had Sally\nat this moment. She walked up to the beautiful, astonished Ruth,\nwhere she stood in her long, soft, white dressing-gown, with all her\nluxuriant brown hair hanging dishevelled down her figure, and thus\nSally spoke:\n\n\"Missus--or miss, as the case may be--I've my doubts as to you. I'm\nnot going to have my master and Miss Faith put upon, or shame come\nnear them. Widows wears these sort o' caps, and has their hair cut\noff; and whether widows wears wedding-rings or not, they shall have\ntheir hair cut off--they shall. I'll have no half work in this house.\nI've lived with the family forty-nine year come Michaelmas, and I'll\nnot see it disgraced by any one's fine long curls. Sit down and let\nme snip off your hair, and let me see you sham decently in a widow's\ncap to-morrow, or I'll leave the house. Whatten's come over Miss\nFaith, as used to be as mim a lady as ever was, to be taken by such\nas you, I dunnot know. Here! sit down with ye, and let me crop you.\"\n\nShe laid no light hand on Ruth's shoulder; and the latter, partly\nintimidated by the old servant, who had hitherto only turned\nher vixen lining to observation, and partly because she was\nbroken-spirited enough to be indifferent to the measure proposed,\nquietly sat down. Sally produced the formidable pair of scissors that\nalways hung at her side, and began to cut in a merciless manner. She\nexpected some remonstrance or some opposition, and had a torrent of\nwords ready to flow forth at the least sign of rebellion; but Ruth\nwas still and silent, with meekly-bowed head, under the strange hands\nthat were shearing her beautiful hair into the clipped shortness of a\nboy's. Long before she had finished, Sally had some slight misgivings\nas to the fancied necessity of her task; but it was too late, for\nhalf the curls were gone, and the rest must now come off. When she\nhad done, she lifted up Ruth's face by placing her hand under the\nround white chin. She gazed into the countenance, expecting to read\nsome anger there, though it had not come out in words; but she only\nmet the large, quiet eyes, that looked at her with sad gentleness\nout of their finely-hollowed orbits. Ruth's soft, yet dignified\nsubmission, touched Sally with compunction, though she did not choose\nto show the change in her feelings. She tried to hide it, indeed, by\nstooping to pick up the long bright tresses; and, holding them up\nadmiringly, and letting them drop down and float on the air (like\nthe pendant branches of the weeping birch), she said: \"I thought\nwe should ha' had some crying--I did. They're pretty curls enough;\nyou've not been so bad to let them be cut off neither. You see,\nMaster Thurstan is no wiser than a babby in some things; and Miss\nFaith just lets him have his own way; so it's all left to me to keep\nhim out of scrapes. I'll wish you a very good night. I've heard many\na one say as long hair was not wholesome. Good night.\"\n\nBut in a minute she popped her head into Ruth's room once more:\n\n\"You'll put on them caps to-morrow morning. I'll make you a present\non them.\"\n\nSally had carried away the beautiful curls, and she could not find\nit in her heart to throw such lovely chestnut tresses away, so she\nfolded them up carefully in paper, and placed them in a safe corner\nof her drawer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nRuth's First Sunday at Eccleston\n\n\nRuth felt very shy when she came down (at half-past seven) the\nnext morning, in her widow's cap. Her smooth, pale face, with its\noval untouched by time, looked more young and childlike than ever,\nwhen contrasted with the head-gear usually associated with ideas\nof age. She blushed very deeply as Mr and Miss Benson showed the\nastonishment, which they could not conceal, in their looks. She said\nin a low voice to Miss Benson,\n\n\"Sally thought I had better wear it.\"\n\nMiss Benson made no reply; but was startled at the intelligence,\nwhich she thought was conveyed in this speech, of Sally's\nacquaintance with Ruth's real situation. She noticed Sally's looks\nparticularly this morning. The manner in which the old servant\ntreated Ruth had in it far more of respect than there had been the\nday before; but there was a kind of satisfied way of braving out Miss\nBenson's glances which made the latter uncertain and uncomfortable.\n\nShe followed her brother into his study.\n\n\"Do you know, Thurstan, I am almost certain Sally suspects.\"\n\nMr Benson sighed. The deception grieved him, and yet he thought he\nsaw its necessity.\n\n\"What makes you think so?\" asked he.\n\n\"Oh! many little things. It was her odd way of ducking her head\nabout, as if to catch a good view of Ruth's left hand, that made me\nthink of the wedding-ring; and once, yesterday, when I thought I had\nmade up quite a natural speech, and was saying how sad it was for\nso young a creature to be left a widow, she broke in with 'widow be\nfarred!' in a very strange, contemptuous kind of manner.\"\n\n\"If she suspects, we had far better tell her the truth at once. She\nwill never rest till she finds it out, so we must make a virtue of\nnecessity.\"\n\n\"Well, brother, you shall tell her then, for I am sure I daren't.\nI don't mind doing the thing, since you talked to me that day, and\nsince I've got to know Ruth; but I do mind all the clatter people\nwill make about it.\"\n\n\"But Sally is not 'people.'\"\n\n\"Oh, I see it must be done; she'll talk as much as all the other\npersons put together, so that's the reason I call her 'people.' Shall\nI call her?\" (For the house was too homely and primitive to have\nbells.)\n\nSally came, fully aware of what was now going to be told her, and\ndetermined not to help them out in telling their awkward secret, by\nunderstanding the nature of it before it was put into the plainest\nlanguage. In every pause, when they hoped she had caught the meaning\nthey were hinting at, she persisted in looking stupid and perplexed,\nand in saying, \"Well,\" as if quite unenlightened as to the end of\nthe story. When it was all complete and plain before her, she said,\nhonestly enough,\n\n\"It's just as I thought it was; and I think you may thank me for\nhaving had the sense to put her into widow's caps, and clip off that\nbonny brown hair that was fitter for a bride in lawful matrimony than\nfor such as her. She took it very well, though. She was as quiet as a\nlamb, and I clipped her pretty roughly at first. I must say, though,\nif I'd ha' known who your visitor was, I'd ha' packed up my things\nand cleared myself out of the house before such as her came into it.\nAs it's done, I suppose I must stand by you, and help you through\nwith it; I only hope I shan't lose my character,--and me a parish\nclerk's daughter.\"\n\n\"Oh, Sally! people know you too well to think any ill of you,\" said\nMiss Benson, who was pleased to find the difficulty so easily got\nover; for, in truth, Sally had been much softened by the unresisting\ngentleness with which Ruth had submitted to the \"clipping\" of the\nnight before.\n\n\"If I'd been with you, Master Thurstan, I'd ha' seen sharp after you,\nfor you're always picking up some one or another as nobody else would\ntouch with a pair of tongs. Why, there was that Nelly Brandon's child\nas was left at our door, if I hadn't gone to th' overseer we should\nhave had that Irish tramp's babby saddled on us for life; but I went\noff and told th' overseer, and th' mother was caught.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr Benson, sadly, \"and I often lie awake and wonder what\nis the fate of that poor little thing, forced back on the mother who\ntried to get quit of it. I often doubt whether I did right; but it's\nno use thinking about it now.\"\n\n\"I'm thankful it isn't,\" said Sally; \"and now, if we've talked\ndoctrine long enough, I'll go make th' beds. Yon girl's secret is\nsafe enough for me.\"\n\nSaying this she left the room, and Miss Benson followed. She found\nRuth busy washing the breakfast things; and they were done in so\nquiet and orderly a manner, that neither Miss Benson nor Sally, both\nparticular enough, had any of their little fancies or prejudices\nannoyed. She seemed to have an instinctive knowledge of the exact\nperiod when her help was likely to become a hindrance, and withdrew\nfrom the busy kitchen just at the right time.\n\nThat afternoon, as Miss Benson and Ruth sat at their work, Mrs and\nMiss Bradshaw called. Miss Benson was so nervous as to surprise Ruth,\nwho did not understand the probable and possible questions which\nmight be asked respecting any visitor at the minister's house.\nRuth went on sewing, absorbed in her own thoughts, and glad that\nthe conversation between the two elder ladies and the silence of\nthe younger one, who sat at some distance from her, gave her an\nopportunity of retreating into the haunts of memory; and soon the\nwork fell from her hands, and her eyes were fixed on the little\ngarden beyond, but she did not see its flowers or its walls; she\nsaw the mountains which girdled Llan-dhu, and saw the sun rise from\nbehind their iron outline, just as it had done--how long ago? was\nit months or was it years?--since she had watched the night through,\ncrouched up at _his_ door. Which was the dream and which the reality?\nthat distant life, or this? His moans rang more clearly in her ears\nthan the buzzing of the conversation between Mrs Bradshaw and Miss\nBenson.\n\nAt length the subdued, scared-looking little lady and her bright-eyed\nsilent daughter rose to take leave; Ruth started into the present,\nand stood up and curtseyed, and turned sick at heart with sudden\nrecollection.\n\nMiss Benson accompanied Mrs Bradshaw to the door; and in the passage\ngave her a long explanation of Ruth's (fictitious) history. Mrs\nBradshaw looked so much interested and pleased, that Miss Benson\nenlarged a little more than was necessary, and rounded off her\ninvention with one or two imaginary details, which, she was quite\nunconscious, were overheard by her brother through the half-open\nstudy door.\n\nShe was rather dismayed when he called her into his room after Mrs\nBradshaw's departure, and asked her what she had been saying about\nRuth?\n\n\"Oh! I thought it was better to explain it thoroughly--I mean, to\ntell the story we wished to have believed once for all--you know we\nagreed about that, Thurstan?\" deprecatingly.\n\n\"Yes; but I heard you saying you believed her husband had been a\nyoung surgeon, did I not?\"\n\n\"Well, Thurstan, you know he must have been something; and young\nsurgeons are so in the way of dying, it seemed very natural.\nBesides,\" said she, with sudden boldness, \"I do think I've a talent\nfor fiction, it is so pleasant to invent, and make the incidents\ndovetail together; and after all, if we are to tell a lie, we may as\nwell do it thoroughly, or else it's of no use. A bungling lie would\nbe worse than useless. And, Thurstan--it may be very wrong--but\nI believe--I am afraid I enjoy not being fettered by truth. Don't\nlook so grave. You know it is necessary, if ever it was, to tell\nfalsehoods now; and don't be angry with me because I do it well.\"\n\nHe was shading his eyes with his hand, and did not speak for some\ntime. At last he said:\n\n\"If it were not for the child, I would tell all; but the world is so\ncruel. You don't know how this apparent necessity for falsehood pains\nme, Faith, or you would not invent all these details, which are so\nmany additional lies.\"\n\n\"Well, well! I will restrain myself if I have to talk about Ruth\nagain. But Mrs Bradshaw will tell every one who need to know. You\ndon't wish me to contradict it, Thurstan, surely--it was such a\npretty, probable story.\"\n\n\"Faith! I hope God will forgive us if we are doing wrong; and pray,\ndear, don't add one unnecessary word that is not true.\"\n\nAnother day elapsed, and then it was Sunday; and the house seemed\nfilled with a deep peace. Even Sally's movements were less hasty and\nabrupt. Mr Benson seemed invested with a new dignity, which made his\nbodily deformity be forgotten in his calm, grave composure of spirit.\nEvery trace of week-day occupation was put away; the night before, a\nbright new handsome tablecloth had been smoothed down over the table,\nand the jars had been freshly filled with flowers. Sunday was a\nfestival and a holy day in the house. After the very early breakfast,\nlittle feet pattered into Mr Benson's study, for he had a class for\nboys--a sort of domestic Sunday-school, only that there was more\ntalking between teacher and pupils, than dry, absolute lessons going\non. Miss Benson, too, had her little, neat-tippeted maidens sitting\nwith her in the parlour; and she was far more particular in keeping\nthem to their reading and spelling, than her brother was with his\nboys. Sally, too, put in her word of instruction from the kitchen,\nhelping, as she fancied, though her assistance was often rather\n_malapropos_; for instance, she called out, to a little fat, stupid,\nroly-poly girl, to whom Miss Benson was busy explaining the meaning\nof the word quadruped,\n\n\"Quadruped, a thing wi' four legs, Jenny; a chair is a quadruped,\nchild!\"\n\nBut Miss Benson had a deaf manner sometimes when her patience was not\ntoo severely tried, and she put it on now. Ruth sat on a low hassock,\nand coaxed the least of the little creatures to her, and showed it\npictures till it fell asleep in her arms, and sent a thrill through\nher, at the thought of the tiny darling who would lie on her breast\nbefore long, and whom she would have to cherish and to shelter from\nthe storms of the world.\n\nAnd then she remembered, that she was once white and sinless as\nthe wee lassie who lay in her arms; and she knew that she had gone\nastray. By-and-by the children trooped away, and Miss Benson summoned\nher to put on her things for chapel.\n\nThe chapel was up a narrow street, or rather _cul-de-sac_, close by.\nIt stood on the outskirts of the town, almost in fields. It was built\nabout the time of Matthew and Philip Henry, when the Dissenters were\nafraid of attracting attention or observation, and hid their places\nof worship in obscure and out-of-the-way parts of the towns in which\nthey were built. Accordingly, it often happened, as in the present\ncase, that the buildings immediately surrounding, as well as the\nchapels themselves, looked as if they carried you back to a period\na hundred and fifty years ago. The chapel had a picturesque and\nold-world look, for luckily the congregation had been too poor\nto rebuild it, or new-face it, in George the Third's time. The\nstaircases which led to the galleries were outside, at each end of\nthe building, and the irregular roof and worn stone steps looked\ngrey and stained by time and weather. The grassy hillocks, each with\na little upright headstone, were shaded by a grand old wych-elm.\nA lilac-bush or two, a white rose-tree, and a few laburnums, all\nold and gnarled enough, were planted round the chapel yard; and\nthe casement windows of the chapel were made of heavy-leaded,\ndiamond-shaped panes, almost covered with ivy, producing a green\ngloom, not without its solemnity, within. This ivy was the home of an\ninfinite number of little birds, which twittered and warbled, till\nit might have been thought that they were emulous of the power of\npraise possessed by the human creatures within, with such earnest,\nlong-drawn strains did this crowd of winged songsters rejoice and be\nglad in their beautiful gift of life. The interior of the building\nwas plain and simple as plain and simple could be. When it was fitted\nup, oak-timber was much cheaper than it is now, so the wood-work was\nall of that description; but roughly hewed, for the early builders\nhad not much wealth to spare. The walls were whitewashed, and were\nrecipients of the shadows of the beauty without; on their \"white\nplains\" the tracery of the ivy might be seen, now still, now stirred\nby the sudden flight of some little bird. The congregation consisted\nof here and there a farmer with his labourers, who came down from the\nuplands beyond the town to worship where their fathers worshipped,\nand who loved the place because they knew how much those fathers had\nsuffered for it, although they never troubled themselves with the\nreason why they left the parish church; of a few shopkeepers, far\nmore thoughtful and reasoning, who were Dissenters from conviction,\nunmixed with old ancestral association; and of one or two families of\nstill higher worldly station. With many poor, who were drawn there by\nlove for Mr Benson's character, and by a feeling that the faith which\nmade him what he was could not be far wrong, for the base of the\npyramid, and with Mr Bradshaw for its apex, the congregation stood\ncomplete.\n\nThe country people came in sleeking down their hair, and treading\nwith earnest attempts at noiseless lightness of step over the floor\nof the aisle; and by-and-by, when all were assembled, Mr Benson\nfollowed, unmarshalled and unattended. When he had closed the\npulpit-door, and knelt in prayer for an instant or two, he gave out\na psalm from the dear old Scottish paraphrase, with its primitive\ninversion of the simple perfect Bible words; and a kind of precentor\nstood up, and, having sounded the note on a pitch-pipe, sang a couple\nof lines by way of indicating the tune; then all the congregation\nstood up, and sang aloud, Mr Bradshaw's great bass voice being half\na note in advance of the others, in accordance with his place of\nprecedence as principal member of the congregation. His powerful\nvoice was like an organ very badly played, and very much out of tune;\nbut as he had no ear, and no diffidence, it pleased him very much\nto hear the fine loud sound. He was a tall, large-boned, iron man;\nstern, powerful, and authoritative in appearance; dressed in clothes\nof the finest broadcloth, and scrupulously ill-made, as if to show\nthat he was indifferent to all outward things. His wife was sweet and\ngentle-looking, but as if she was thoroughly broken into submission.\n\nRuth did not see this, or hear aught but the words which were\nreverently--oh, how reverently!--spoken by Mr Benson. He had had Ruth\npresent in his thoughts all the time he had been preparing for his\nSunday duty; and he had tried carefully to eschew everything which\nshe might feel as an allusion to her own case. He remembered how the\nGood Shepherd, in Poussin's beautiful picture, tenderly carried the\nlambs which had wearied themselves by going astray, and felt how like\ntenderness was required towards poor Ruth. But where is the chapter\nwhich does not contain something which a broken and contrite spirit\nmay not apply to itself? And so it fell out that, as he read, Ruth's\nheart was smitten, and she sank down, and down, till she was kneeling\non the floor of the pew, and speaking to God in the spirit, if not in\nthe words, of the Prodigal Son: \"Father! I have sinned against Heaven\nand before Thee, and am no more worthy to be called Thy child!\" Miss\nBenson was thankful (although she loved Ruth the better for this\nself-abandonment) that the minister's seat was far in the shade of\nthe gallery. She tried to look most attentive to her brother, in\norder that Mr Bradshaw might not suspect anything unusual, while she\nstealthily took hold of Ruth's passive hand, as it lay helpless on\nthe cushion, and pressed it softly and tenderly. But Ruth sat on the\nground, bowed down and crushed in her sorrow, till all was ended.\n\nMiss Benson loitered in her seat, divided between the consciousness\nthat she, as _locum tenens_ for the minister's wife, was expected\nto be at the door to receive the kind greetings of many after her\nabsence from home, and her unwillingness to disturb Ruth, who was\nevidently praying, and, by her quiet breathing, receiving grave and\nsolemn influences into her soul. At length she rose up, calm and\ncomposed even to dignity. The chapel was still and empty; but Miss\nBenson heard the buzz of voices in the chapel-yard without. They were\nprobably those of people waiting for her; and she summoned courage,\nand taking Ruth's arm in hers, and holding her hand affectionately,\nthey went out into the broad daylight. As they issued forth, Miss\nBenson heard Mr Bradshaw's strong bass voice speaking to her brother,\nand winced, as she knew he would be wincing, under the broad praise,\nwhich is impertinence, however little it may be intended or esteemed\nas such.\n\n\"Oh, yes!--my wife told me yesterday about her--her husband was a\nsurgeon; my father was a surgeon too, as I think you have heard. Very\nmuch to your credit, I must say, Mr Benson, with your limited means,\nto burden yourself with a poor relation. Very creditable indeed.\"\n\nMiss Benson glanced at Ruth; she either did not hear or did not\nunderstand, but passed on into the awful sphere of Mr Bradshaw's\nobservation unmoved. He was in a bland and condescending humour of\nuniversal approval, and when he saw Ruth, he nodded his head in token\nof satisfaction. That ordeal was over, Miss Benson thought, and in\nthe thought rejoiced.\n\n\"After dinner, you must go and lie down, my dear,\" said she, untying\nRuth's bonnet-strings, and kissing her. \"Sally goes to church again,\nbut you won't mind staying alone in the house. I am sorry we have\nso many people to dinner, but my brother will always have enough\non Sundays for any old or weak people, who may have come from a\ndistance, to stay and dine with us; and to-day they all seem to have\ncome, because it is his first Sabbath at home.\"\n\nIn this way Ruth's first Sabbath passed over.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nMother and Child\n\n\n\"Here is a parcel for you, Ruth!\" said Miss Benson on the Tuesday\nmorning.\n\n\"For me!\" said Ruth, all sorts of rushing thoughts and hopes filling\nher mind, and turning her dizzy with expectation. If it had been from\n\"him,\" the new-born resolutions would have had a hard struggle for\nexistence.\n\n\"It is directed 'Mrs Denbigh,'\" said Miss Benson, before giving it\nup. \"It is in Mrs Bradshaw's handwriting;\" and, far more curious\nthan Ruth, she awaited the untying of the close-knotted string.\nWhen the paper was opened, it displayed a whole piece of delicate\ncambric-muslin; and there was a short note from Mrs Bradshaw to Ruth,\nsaying her husband had wished her to send this muslin in aid of any\npreparations Mrs Denbigh might have to make. Ruth said nothing, but\ncoloured up, and sat down again to her employment.\n\n\"Very fine muslin indeed,\" said Miss Benson, feeling it, and holding\nit up against the light, with the air of a connoisseur; yet all the\ntime she was glancing at Ruth's grave face. The latter kept silence,\nand showed no wish to inspect her present further. At last she said,\nin a low voice,\n\n\"I suppose I may send it back again?\"\n\n\"My dear child! send it back to Mr Bradshaw! You'd offend him for\nlife. You may depend upon it, he means it as a mark of high favour!\"\n\n\"What right had he to send it me?\" asked Ruth, still in her quiet\nvoice.\n\n\"What right? Mr Bradshaw thinks-- I don't know exactly what you mean\nby 'right.'\"\n\nRuth was silent for a moment, and then said:\n\n\"There are people to whom I love to feel that I owe\ngratitude--gratitude which I cannot express, and had better not talk\nabout--but I cannot see why a person whom I do not know should lay me\nunder an obligation. Oh! don't say I must take this muslin, please,\nMiss Benson!\"\n\nWhat Miss Benson might have said if her brother had not just then\nentered the room, neither he nor any other person could tell; but she\nfelt his presence was most opportune, and called him in as umpire.\nHe had come hastily, for he had much to do; but he no sooner heard\nthe case than he sat down, and tried to draw some more explicit\ndeclaration of her feeling from Ruth, who had remained silent during\nMiss Benson's explanation.\n\n\"You would rather send this present back?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, softly. \"Is it wrong?\"\n\n\"Why do you want to return it?\"\n\n\"Because I feel as if Mr Bradshaw had no right to offer it me.\"\n\nMr Benson was silent.\n\n\"It's beautifully fine,\" said Miss Benson, still examining the piece.\n\n\"You think that it is a right which must be earned?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, after a minute's pause. \"Don't you?\"\n\n\"I understand what you mean. It is a delight to have gifts made to\nyou by those whom you esteem and love, because then such gifts are\nmerely to be considered as fringes to the garment--as inconsiderable\nadditions to the mighty treasure of their affection, adding a grace,\nbut no additional value, to what before was precious, and proceeding\nas naturally out of that as leaves burgeon out upon the trees; but\nyou feel it to be different when there is no regard for the giver to\nidealise the gift--when it simply takes its stand among your property\nas so much money's value. Is this it, Ruth?\"\n\n\"I think it is. I never reasoned why I felt as I did; I only knew\nthat Mr Bradshaw's giving me a present hurt me, instead of making me\nglad.\"\n\n\"Well, but there is another side of the case we have not looked at\nyet--we must think of that, too. You know who said, 'Do unto others\nas ye would that they should do unto you'? Mr Bradshaw may not have\nhad that in his mind when he desired his wife to send you this; he\nmay have been self-seeking, and only anxious to gratify his love of\npatronising--that is the worst motive we can give him; and that would\nbe no excuse for your thinking only of yourself, and returning his\npresent.\"\n\n\"But you would not have me pretend to be obliged?\" asked Ruth.\n\n\"No, I would not. I have often been similarly situated to you, Ruth;\nMr Bradshaw has frequently opposed me on the points on which I feel\nthe warmest--am the most earnestly convinced. He, no doubt, thinks me\nQuixotic, and often speaks of me, and to me, with great contempt when\nhe is angry. I suppose he has a little fit of penitence afterwards,\nor perhaps he thinks he can pay for ungracious speeches by a present;\nso, formerly, he invariably sent me something after these occasions.\nIt was a time, of all others, to feel as you are doing now; but I\nbecame convinced it would be right to accept them, giving only the\nvery cool thanks which I felt. This omission of all show of much\ngratitude had the best effect--the presents have much diminished; but\nif the gifts have lessened, the unjustifiable speeches have decreased\nin still greater proportion, and I am sure we respect each other\nmore. Take this muslin, Ruth, for the reason I named; and thank him\nas your feelings prompt you. Overstrained expressions of gratitude\nalways seem like an endeavour to place the receiver of these\nexpressions in the position of debtor for future favours. But you\nwon't fall into this error.\"\n\nRuth listened to Mr Benson; but she had not yet fallen sufficiently\ninto the tone of his mind to understand him fully. She only felt that\nhe comprehended her better than Miss Benson, who once more tried to\nreconcile her to her present, by calling her attention to the length\nand breadth thereof.\n\n\"I will do what you wish me,\" she said, after a little pause of\nthoughtfulness. \"May we talk of something else?\"\n\nMr Benson saw that his sister's frame of mind was not particularly\ncongenial with Ruth's, any more than Ruth's was with Miss Benson's;\nand, putting aside all thought of returning to the business which had\nappeared to him so important when he came into the room (but which\nprincipally related to himself), he remained above an hour in the\nparlour, interesting them on subjects far removed from the present,\nand left them at the end of that time soothed and calm.\n\nBut the present gave a new current to Ruth's ideas. Her heart was as\nyet too sore to speak, but her mind was crowded with plans. She asked\nSally to buy her (with the money produced by the sale of a ring or\ntwo) the coarsest linen, the homeliest dark blue print, and similar\nmaterials; on which she set busily to work to make clothes for\nherself; and as they were made, she put them on; and as she put them\non, she gave a grace to each, which such homely material and simple\nshaping had never had before. Then the fine linen and delicate soft\nwhite muslin, which she had chosen in preference to more expensive\narticles of dress when Mr Bellingham had given her _carte blanche_ in\nLondon, were cut into small garments, most daintily stitched and made\nready for the little creature, for whom in its white purity of soul\nnothing could be too precious.\n\nThe love which dictated this extreme simplicity and coarseness of\nattire, was taken for stiff, hard economy by Mr Bradshaw, when he\ndeigned to observe it. And economy by itself, without any soul or\nspirit in it to make it living and holy, was a great merit in his\neyes. Indeed, Ruth altogether found favour with him. Her quiet\nmanner, subdued by an internal consciousness of a deeper cause for\nsorrow than he was aware of, he interpreted into a very proper and\nbecoming awe of him. He looked off from his own prayers to observe\nhow well she attended to hers at chapel; when he came to any verse\nin the hymn relating to immortality or a future life, he sang it\nunusually loud, thinking he should thus comfort her in her sorrow\nfor her deceased husband. He desired Mrs Bradshaw to pay her every\nattention she could; and even once remarked, that he thought her so\nrespectable a young person that he should not object to her being\nasked to tea the next time Mr and Miss Benson came. He added, that he\nthought, indeed, Benson had looked last Sunday as if he rather hoped\nto get an invitation; and it was right to encourage the ministers,\nand to show them respect, even though their salaries were small.\nThe only thing against this Mrs Denbigh was the circumstance of her\nhaving married too early, and without any provision for a family.\nThough Ruth pleaded delicacy of health, and declined accompanying Mr\nand Miss Benson on their visit to Mr Bradshaw, she still preserved\nher place in his esteem; and Miss Benson had to call a little upon\nher \"talent for fiction\" to spare Ruth from the infliction of further\npresents, in making which his love of patronising delighted.\n\nThe yellow and crimson leaves came floating down on the still October\nair; November followed, bleak and dreary; it was more cheerful when\nthe earth put on her beautiful robe of white, which covered up all\nthe grey naked stems, and loaded the leaves of the hollies and\nevergreens each with its burden of feathery snow. When Ruth sank down\nto languor and sadness, Miss Benson trotted upstairs, and rummaged\nup every article of spare or worn-out clothing, and bringing down a\nvariety of strange materials, she tried to interest Ruth in making\nthem up into garments for the poor. But though Ruth's fingers flew\nthrough the work, she still sighed with thought and remembrance.\nMiss Benson was at first disappointed, and then she was angry. When\nshe heard the low, long sigh, and saw the dreamy eyes filling with\nglittering tears, she would say, \"What is the matter, Ruth?\" in a\nhalf-reproachful tone, for the sight of suffering was painful to\nher; she had done all in her power to remedy it; and, though she\nacknowledged a cause beyond her reach for Ruth's deep sorrow, and, in\nfact, loved and respected her all the more for these manifestations\nof grief, yet at the time they irritated her. Then Ruth would snatch\nup the dropped work, and stitch away with drooping eyes, from which\nthe hot tears fell fast; and Miss Benson was then angry with herself,\nyet not at all inclined to agree with Sally when she asked her\nmistress \"why she kept 'mithering' the poor lass with asking her for\never what was the matter, as if she did not know well enough.\" Some\nelement of harmony was wanting--some little angel of peace, in loving\nwhom all hearts and natures should be drawn together, and their\ndiscords hushed.\n\nThe earth was still \"hiding her guilty front with innocent snow,\"\nwhen a little baby was laid by the side of the pale white mother. It\nwas a boy; beforehand she had wished for a girl, as being less likely\nto feel the want of a father--as being what a mother, worse than\nwidowed, could most effectually shelter. But now she did not think\nor remember this. What it was, she would not have exchanged for a\nwilderness of girls. It was her own, her darling, her individual\nbaby, already, though not an hour old, separate and sole in her\nheart, strangely filling up its measure with love and peace, and even\nhope. For here was a new, pure, beautiful, innocent life, which she\nfondly imagined, in that early passion of maternal love, she could\nguard from every touch of corrupting sin by ever watchful and most\ntender care. And _her_ mother had thought the same, most probably;\nand thousands of others think the same, and pray to God to purify and\ncleanse their souls, that they may be fit guardians for their little\nchildren. Oh, how Ruth prayed, even while she was yet too weak to\nspeak; and how she felt the beauty and significance of the words,\n\"Our Father!\"\n\nShe was roused from this holy abstraction by the sound of Miss\nBenson's voice. It was very much as if she had been crying.\n\n\"Look, Ruth!\" it said, softly, \"my brother sends you these. They are\nthe first snowdrops in the garden.\" And she put them on the pillow by\nRuth; the baby lay on the opposite side.\n\n\"Won't you look at him?\" said Ruth; \"he is so pretty!\"\n\nMiss Benson had a strange reluctance to see him. To Ruth, in spite\nof all that had come and gone, she was reconciled--nay, more, she\nwas deeply attached; but over the baby there hung a cloud of shame\nand disgrace. Poor little creature! her heart was closed against\nit--firmly, as she thought. But she could not resist Ruth's low faint\nvoice, nor her pleading eyes, and she went round to peep at him as he\nlay in his mother's arm, as yet his shield and guard.\n\n\"Sally says he will have black hair, she thinks,\" said Ruth. \"His\nlittle hand is quite a man's, already. Just feel how firmly he closes\nit;\" and with her own weak fingers she opened his little red fist,\nand taking Miss Benson's reluctant hand, placed one of her fingers\nin his grasp. That baby-touch called out her love; the doors of her\nheart were thrown open wide for the little infant to go in and take\npossession.\n\n\"Ah, my darling!\" said Ruth, falling back weak and weary. \"If God\nwill but spare you to me, never mother did more than I will. I have\ndone you a grievous wrong--but, if I may but live, I will spend my\nlife in serving you!\"\n\n\"And in serving God!\" said Miss Benson, with tears in her eyes. \"You\nmust not make him into an idol, or God will, perhaps, punish you\nthrough him.\"\n\nA pang of affright shot through Ruth's heart at these words; had\nshe already sinned and made her child into an idol, and was there\npunishment already in store for her through him? But then the\ninternal voice whispered that God was \"Our Father,\" and that He knew\nour frame, and knew how natural was the first outburst of a mother's\nlove; so, although she treasured up the warning, she ceased to\naffright herself for what had already gushed forth.\n\n\"Now go to sleep, Ruth,\" said Miss Benson, kissing her, and darkening\nthe room. But Ruth could not sleep; if her heavy eyes closed, she\nopened them again with a start, for sleep seemed to be an enemy\nstealing from her the consciousness of being a mother. That one\nthought excluded all remembrance and all anticipation, in those first\nhours of delight.\n\nBut soon remembrance and anticipation came. There was the natural\nwant of the person, who alone could take an interest similar in kind,\nthough not in amount, to the mother's. And sadness grew like a giant\nin the still watches of the night, when she remembered that there\nwould be no father to guide and strengthen the child, and place him\nin a favourable position for fighting the hard \"Battle of Life.\" She\nhoped and believed that no one would know the sin of his parents, and\nthat that struggle might be spared to him. But a father's powerful\ncare and mighty guidance would never be his; and then, in those hours\nof spiritual purification, came the wonder and the doubt of how far\nthe real father would be the one to whom, with her desire of heaven\nfor her child, whatever might become of herself, she would wish\nto entrust him. Slight speeches, telling of a selfish, worldly\nnature, unnoticed at the time, came back upon her ear, having\na new significance. They told of a low standard, of impatient\nself-indulgence, of no acknowledgment of things spiritual and\nheavenly. Even while this examination was forced upon her, by the new\nspirit of maternity that had entered into her, and made her child's\nwelfare supreme, she hated and reproached herself for the necessity\nthere seemed upon her of examining and judging the absent father of\nher child. And so the compelling presence that had taken possession\nof her wearied her into a kind of feverish slumber; in which she\ndreamt that the innocent babe that lay by her side in soft ruddy\nslumber had started up into man's growth, and, instead of the pure\nand noble being whom she had prayed to present as her child to \"Our\nFather in heaven,\" he was a repetition of his father; and, like him,\nlured some maiden (who in her dream seemed strangely like herself,\nonly more utterly sad and desolate even than she) into sin, and\nleft her there to even a worse fate than that of suicide. For Ruth\nbelieved there was a worse. She dreamt she saw the girl, wandering,\nlost; and that she saw her son in high places, prosperous--but with\nmore than blood on his soul. She saw her son dragged down by the\nclinging girl into some pit of horrors into which she dared not look,\nbut from whence his father's voice was heard, crying aloud, that in\nhis day and generation he had not remembered the words of God, and\nthat now he was \"tormented in this flame.\" Then she started in sick\nterror, and saw, by the dim rushlight, Sally, nodding in an arm-chair\nby the fire; and felt her little soft warm babe, nestled up against\nher breast, rocked by her heart, which yet beat hard from the effects\nof the evil dream. She dared not go to sleep again, but prayed. And\nevery time she prayed, she asked with a more complete wisdom, and\na more utter and self-forgetting faith. Little child! thy angel\nwas with God, and drew her nearer and nearer to Him, whose face is\ncontinually beheld by the angels of little children.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nSally Tells of Her Sweethearts, and Discourses on the Duties of Life\n\n\nSally and Miss Benson took it in turns to sit up, or rather, they\ntook it in turns to nod by the fire; for if Ruth was awake she lay\nvery still in the moonlight calm of her sick bed. That time resembled\na beautiful August evening, such as I have seen. The white, snowy\nrolling mist covers up under its great sheet all trees and meadows,\nand tokens of earth; but it cannot rise high enough to shut out the\nheavens, which on such nights seem bending very near, and to be the\nonly real and present objects; and so near, so real and present, did\nheaven, and eternity, and God seem to Ruth, as she lay encircling her\nmysterious holy child.\n\nOne night Sally found out she was not asleep.\n\n\"I'm a rare hand at talking folks to sleep,\" said she. \"I'll try on\nthee, for thou must get strength by sleeping and eating. What must\nI talk to thee about, I wonder. Shall I tell thee a love story or a\nfairy story, such as I've telled Master Thurstan many a time and many\na time, for all his father set his face again fairies, and called it\nvain talking; or shall I tell you the dinner I once cooked, when Mr\nHarding, as was Miss Faith's sweetheart, came unlooked for, and we'd\nnought in the house but a neck of mutton, out of which I made seven\ndishes, all with a different name?\"\n\n\"Who was Mr Harding?\" asked Ruth.\n\n\"Oh, he was a grand gentleman from Lunnon, as had seen Miss Faith,\nand been struck by her pretty looks when she was out on a visit, and\ncame here to ask her to marry him. She said, 'No, she would never\nleave Master Thurstan, as could never marry;' but she pined a deal\nat after he went away. She kept up afore Master Thurstan, but I seed\nher fretting, though I never let on that I did, for I thought she'd\nsoonest get over it and be thankful at after she'd the strength to\ndo right. However, I've no business to be talking of Miss Benson's\nconcerns. I'll tell you of my own sweethearts and welcome, or I'll\ntell you of the dinner, which was the grandest thing I ever did in my\nlife, but I thought a Lunnoner should never think country folks knew\nnothing; and, my word! I puzzled him with his dinner. I'm doubting\nwhether to this day he knows whether what he was eating was fish,\nflesh, or fowl. Shall I tell you how I managed?\"\n\nBut Ruth said she would rather hear about Sally's sweethearts, much\nto the disappointment of the latter, who considered the dinner by far\nthe greatest achievement.\n\n\"Well, you see, I don't know as I should call them sweethearts; for\nexcepting John Rawson, who was shut up in the mad-house the next\nweek, I never had what you may call a downright offer of marriage\nbut once. But I had once; and so I may say I had a sweetheart. I\nwas beginning to be afeard though, for one likes to be axed; that's\nbut civility; and I remember, after I had turned forty, and afore\nJeremiah Dixon had spoken, I began to think John Rawson had perhaps\nnot been so very mad, and that I'd done ill to lightly his offer, as\na madman's, if it was to be the only one I was ever to have; I don't\nmean as I'd have had him, but I thought, if it was to come o'er\nagain, I'd speak respectful of him to folk, and say it were only his\nway to go about on all fours, but that he was a sensible man in most\nthings. However, I'd had my laugh, and so had others, at my crazy\nlover, and it was late now to set him up as a Solomon. However, I\nthought it would be no bad thing to be tried again; but I little\nthought the trial would come when it did. You see, Saturday night is\na leisure night in counting-houses and such-like places, while it's\nthe busiest of all for servants. Well! it was a Saturday night, and\nI'd my baize apron on, and the tails of my bed-gown pinned together\nbehind, down on my knees, pipeclaying the kitchen, when a knock comes\nto the back door. 'Come in!' says I; but it knocked again, as if it\nwere too stately to open the door for itself; so I got up, rather\ncross, and opened the door; and there stood Jerry Dixon, Mr Holt's\nhead clerk; only he was not head clerk then. So I stood, stopping\nup the door, fancying he wanted to speak to master; but he kind of\npushed past me, and telling me summut about the weather (as if I\ncould not see it for myself), he took a chair, and sat down by the\noven. 'Cool and easy!' thought I; meaning hisself, not his place,\nwhich I knew must be pretty hot. Well! it seemed no use standing\nwaiting for my gentleman to go; not that he had much to say either;\nbut he kept twirling his hat round and round, and smoothing the nap\non't with the back of his hand. So at last I squatted down to my\nwork, and thinks I, I shall be on my knees all ready if he puts up\na prayer, for I knew he was a Methodee by bringing-up, and had only\nlately turned to master's way of thinking; and them Methodees are\nterrible hands at unexpected prayers when one least looks for 'em. I\ncan't say I like their way of taking one by surprise, as it were; but\nthen I'm a parish clerk's daughter, and could never demean myself to\ndissenting fashions, always save and except Master Thurstan's, bless\nhim. However, I'd been caught once or twice unawares, so this time I\nthought I'd be up to it, and I moved a dry duster wherever I went, to\nkneel upon in case he began when I were in a wet place. By-and-by I\nthought, if the man would pray it would be a blessing, for it would\nprevent his sending his eyes after me wherever I went; for when they\ntakes to praying they shuts their eyes, and quivers th' lids in a\nqueer kind o' way--them Dissenters does. I can speak pretty plain\nto you, for you're bred in the Church like mysel', and must find it\nas out o' the way as I do to be among dissenting folk. God forbid\nI should speak disrespectful of Master Thurstan and Miss Faith,\nthough; I never think on them as Church or Dissenters, but just as\nChristians. But to come back to Jerry. First, I tried always to be\ncleaning at his back; but when he wheeled round, so as always to face\nme, I thought I'd try a different game. So, says I, 'Master Dixon, I\nax your pardon, but I must pipeclay under your chair. Will you please\nto move?' Well, he moved; and by-and-by I was at him again with the\nsame words; and at after that, again and again, till he were always\nmoving about wi' his chair behind him, like a snail as carries its\nhouse on its back. And the great gaupus never seed that I were\npipeclaying the same places twice over. At last I got desperate\ncross, he were so in my way; so I made two big crosses on the tails\nof his brown coat; for you see, whenever he went, up or down, he drew\nout the tails of his coat from under him, and stuck them through the\nbars of the chair; and flesh and blood could not resist pipeclaying\nthem for him; and a pretty brushing he'd have, I reckon, to get it\noff again. Well! at length he clears his throat uncommon loud; so I\nspreads my duster, and shuts my eyes all ready; but when nought comed\nof it, I opened my eyes a little bit to see what he were about. My\nword! if there he wasn't down on his knees right facing me, staring\nas hard as he could. Well! I thought it would be hard work to stand\nthat, if he made a long ado; so I shut my eyes again, and tried to\nthink serious, as became what I fancied were coming; but, forgive\nme! but I thought why couldn't the fellow go in and pray wi' Master\nThurstan, as had always a calm spirit ready for prayer, instead o'\nme, who had my dresser to scour, let alone an apron to iron. At last\nhe says, says he, 'Sally! will you oblige me with your hand?' So I\nthought it were, maybe, Methodee fashion to pray hand in hand; and\nI'll not deny but I wished I'd washed it better after black-leading\nthe kitchen fire. I thought I'd better tell him it were not so clean\nas I could wish, so says I, 'Master Dixon, you shall have it, and\nwelcome, if I may just go and wash 'em first.' But, says he, 'My\ndear Sally, dirty or clean it's all the same to me, seeing I'm only\nspeaking in a figuring way. What I'm asking on my bended knees is,\nthat you'd please to be so kind as to be my wedded wife; week after\nnext will suit me, if it's agreeable to you!' My word! I were up on\nmy feet in an instant! It were odd now, weren't it? I never thought\nof taking the fellow, and getting married; for all, I'll not deny, I\nhad been thinking it would be agreeable to be axed. But all at once,\nI couldn't abide the chap. 'Sir,' says I, trying to look shame-faced\nas became the occasion, but for all that, feeling a twittering round\nmy mouth that I were afeard might end in a laugh--'Master Dixon, I'm\nobleeged to you for the compliment, and thank ye all the same, but\nI think I'd prefer a single life.' He looked mighty taken aback; but\nin a minute he cleared up, and was as sweet as ever. He still kept\non his knees, and I wished he'd take himself up; but, I reckon, he\nthought it would give force to his words; says he, 'Think again, my\ndear Sally. I've a four-roomed house, and furniture conformable; and\neighty pound a year. You may never have such a chance again.' There\nwere truth enough in that, but it was not pretty in the man to say\nit; and it put me up a bit. 'As for that, neither you nor I can tell,\nMaster Dixon. You're not the first chap as I've had down on his knees\nafore me, axing me to marry him (you see I were thinking of John\nRawson, only I thought there were no need to say he were on all\nfours--it were truth he were on his knees, you know), and maybe\nyou'll not be the last. Anyhow, I've no wish to change my condition\njust now.' 'I'll wait till Christmas,' says he. 'I've a pig as will\nbe ready for killing then, so I must get married before that.' Well\nnow! would you believe it? the pig were a temptation. I'd a receipt\nfor curing hams, as Miss Faith would never let me try, saying the\nold way were good enough. However, I resisted. Says I, very stern,\nbecause I felt I'd been wavering, 'Master Dixon, once for all, pig\nor no pig, I'll not marry you. And if you'll take my advice, you'll\nget up off your knees. The flags is but damp yet, and it would be an\nawkward thing to have rheumatiz just before winter.' With that he\ngot up, stiff enough. He looked as sulky a chap as ever I clapped\neyes on. And as he were so black and cross, I thought I'd done well\n(whatever came of the pig) to say 'No' to him. 'You may live to\nrepent this,' says he, very red. 'But I'll not be too hard upon ye,\nI'll give you another chance. I'll let you have the night to think\nabout it, and I'll just call in to hear your second thoughts, after\nchapel to-morrow.' Well now! did ever you hear the like? But that is\nthe way with all of them men, thinking so much of theirselves, and\nthat it's but ask and have. They've never had me, though; and I shall\nbe sixty-one next Martinmas, so there's not much time left for them\nto try me, I reckon. Well! when Jeremiah said that, he put me up more\nthan ever, and I says, 'My first thoughts, second thoughts, and third\nthoughts is all one and the same; you've but tempted me once, and\nthat was when you spoke of your pig. But of yoursel' you're nothing\nto boast on, and so I'll bid you good night, and I'll keep my\nmanners, or else, if I told the truth, I should say it had been a\ngreat loss of time listening to you. But I'll be civil--so good\nnight.' He never said a word, but went off as black as thunder,\nslamming the door after him. The master called me in to prayers, but\nI can't say I could put my mind to them, for my heart was beating so.\nHowever, it was a comfort to have had an offer of holy matrimony;\nand though it flustered me, it made me think more of myself. In the\nnight, I began to wonder if I'd not been cruel and hard to him. You\nsee, I were feverish-like; and the old song of Barbary Allen would\nkeep running in my head, and I thought I were Barbary, and he were\nyoung Jemmy Gray, and that maybe he'd die for love of me; and I\npictured him to mysel', lying on his death-bed, with his face turned\nto the wall, 'wi' deadly sorrow sighing,' and I could ha' pinched\nmysel' for having been so like cruel Barbary Allen. And when I got up\nnext day, I found it hard to think on the real Jerry Dixon I had seen\nthe night before, apart from the sad and sorrowful Jerry I thought on\na-dying, when I were between sleeping and waking. And for many a day\nI turned sick, when I heard the passing bell, for I thought it were\nthe bell loud-knelling which were to break my heart wi' a sense\nof what I'd missed in saying 'No' to Jerry, and so killing him\nwith cruelty. But in less than a three week, I heard parish bells\na-ringing merrily for a wedding; and in the course of a morning,\nsome one says to me, 'Hark! how the bells is ringing for Jerry\nDixon's wedding!' And, all on a sudden, he changed back again from a\nheart-broken young fellow, like Jemmy Gray, into a stout, middle-aged\nman, ruddy-complexioned, with a wart on his left cheek like life!\"\n\nSally waited for some exclamation at the conclusion of her tale; but\nreceiving none, she stepped softly to the bedside, and there lay\nRuth, peaceful as death, with her baby on her breast.\n\n\"I thought I'd lost some of my gifts if I could not talk a body to\nsleep,\" said Sally, in a satisfied and self-complacent tone.\n\nYouth is strong and powerful, and makes a hard battle against sorrow.\nSo Ruth strove and strengthened, and her baby flourished accordingly;\nand before the little celandines were out on the hedge-banks, or the\nwhite violets had sent forth their fragrance from the border under\nthe south wall of Miss Benson's small garden, Ruth was able to carry\nher baby into that sheltered place on sunny days.\n\nShe often wished to thank Mr Benson and his sister, but she did not\nknow how to tell the deep gratitude she felt, and therefore she was\nsilent. But they understood her silence well. One day, as she watched\nher sleeping child, she spoke to Miss Benson, with whom she happened\nto be alone.\n\n\"Do you know of any cottage where the people are clean, and where\nthey would not mind taking me in?\" asked she.\n\n\"Taking you in! What do you mean?\" said Miss Benson, dropping her\nknitting, in order to observe Ruth more closely.\n\n\"I mean,\" said Ruth, \"where I might lodge with my baby--any very poor\nplace would do, only it must be clean, or he might be ill.\"\n\n\"And what in the world do you want to go and lodge in a cottage for?\"\nsaid Miss Benson, indignantly.\n\nRuth did not lift up her eyes, but she spoke with a firmness which\nshowed that she had considered the subject.\n\n\"I think I could make dresses. I know I did not learn as much as I\nmight, but perhaps I might do for servants, and people who are not\nparticular.\"\n\n\"Servants are as particular as any one,\" said Miss Benson, glad to\nlay hold of the first objection that she could.\n\n\"Well! somebody who would be patient with me,\" said Ruth.\n\n\"Nobody is patient over an ill-fitting gown,\" put in Miss Benson.\n\"There's the stuff spoilt, and what not!\"\n\n\"Perhaps I could find plain work to do,\" said Ruth, very meekly.\n\"That I can do very well; mamma taught me, and I liked to learn from\nher. If you would be so good, Miss Benson, you might tell people I\ncould do plain work very neatly, and punctually, and cheaply.\"\n\n\"You'd get sixpence a day, perhaps,\" said Miss Benson, \"and who would\ntake care of baby, I should like to know? Prettily he'd be neglected,\nwould not he? Why, he'd have the croup and the typhus fever in no\ntime, and be burnt to ashes after.\"\n\n\"I have thought of all. Look how he sleeps! Hush, darling;\" for just\nat this point he began to cry, and to show his determination to be\nawake, as if in contradiction to his mother's words. Ruth took him\nup, and carried him about the room while she went on speaking.\n\n\"Yes, just now I know he will not sleep; but very often he will, and\nin the night he always does.\"\n\n\"And so you'd work in the night and kill yourself, and leave your\npoor baby an orphan. Ruth! I'm ashamed of you. Now, brother\" (Mr\nBenson had just come in), \"is not this too bad of Ruth; here she is\nplanning to go away and leave us, just as we--as I, at least, have\ngrown so fond of baby, and he's beginning to know me.\"\n\n\"Where were you thinking of going to, Ruth?\" interrupted Mr Benson,\nwith mild surprise.\n\n\"Anywhere to be near you and Miss Benson; in any poor cottage where I\nmight lodge very cheaply, and earn my livelihood by taking in plain\nsewing, and perhaps a little dressmaking; and where I could come and\nsee you and dear Miss Benson sometimes and bring baby.\"\n\n\"If he was not dead before then of some fever, or burn, or scald,\npoor neglected child; or you had not worked yourself to death with\nnever sleeping,\" said Miss Benson.\n\nMr Benson thought a minute or two, and then he spoke to Ruth.\n\n\"Whatever you may do when this little fellow is a year old, and able\nto dispense with some of a mother's care, let me beg you, Ruth, as\na favour to me--as a still greater favour to my sister, is it not,\nFaith?\"\n\n\"Yes; you may put it so if you like.\"\n\n\"To stay with us,\" continued he, \"till then. When baby is twelve\nmonths old, we'll talk about it again, and very likely before then\nsome opening may be shown us. Never fear leading an idle life, Ruth.\nWe'll treat you as a daughter, and set you all the household tasks;\nand it is not for your sake that we ask you to stay, but for this\nlittle dumb helpless child's; and it is not for our sake that you\nmust stay, but for his.\"\n\nRuth was sobbing.\n\n\"I do not deserve your kindness,\" said she, in a broken voice; \"I do\nnot deserve it.\"\n\nHer tears fell fast and soft like summer rain, but no further word\nwas spoken. Mr Benson quietly passed on to make the inquiry for which\nhe had entered the room.\n\nBut when there was nothing to decide upon, and no necessity for\nentering upon any new course of action, Ruth's mind relaxed from\nits strung-up state. She fell into trains of reverie, and mournful\nregretful recollections which rendered her languid and tearful. This\nwas noticed both by Miss Benson and Sally, and as each had keen\nsympathies, and felt depressed when they saw any one near them\ndepressed, and as each, without much reasoning on the cause or reason\nfor such depression, felt irritated at the uncomfortable state into\nwhich they themselves were thrown, they both resolved to speak to\nRuth on the next fitting occasion.\n\nAccordingly, one afternoon--the morning of that day had been spent by\nRuth in housework, for she had insisted on Mr Benson's words, and had\ntaken Miss Benson's share of the more active and fatiguing household\nduties, but she went through them heavily, and as if her heart was\nfar away--in the afternoon when she was nursing her child, Sally,\non coming into the back parlour, found her there alone, and easily\ndetected the fact that she had been crying.\n\n\"Where's Miss Benson?\" said Sally, gruffly.\n\n\"Gone out with Mr Benson,\" answered Ruth, with an absent sadness\nin her voice and manner. Her tears, scarce checked while she spoke,\nbegan to fall afresh; and as Sally stood and gazed she saw the babe\nlook back in his mother's face, and his little lip begin to quiver,\nand his open blue eye to grow over-clouded, as with some mysterious\nsympathy with the sorrowful face bent over him. Sally took him\nbriskly from his mother's arms; Ruth looked up in grave surprise, for\nin truth she had forgotten Sally's presence, and the suddenness of\nthe motion startled her.\n\n\"My bonny boy! are they letting the salt tears drop on thy sweet face\nbefore thou'rt weaned! Little somebody knows how to be a mother--I\ncould make a better myself. 'Dance, thumbkin, dance--dance, ye merry\nmen every one.' Aye, that's it! smile, my pretty. Any one but a child\nlike thee,\" continued she, turning to Ruth, \"would have known better\nthan to bring ill-luck on thy babby by letting tears fall on its face\nbefore it was weaned. But thou'rt not fit to have a babby, and so\nI've said many a time. I've a great mind to buy thee a doll, and take\nthy babby mysel'.\"\n\nSally did not look at Ruth, for she was too much engaged in amusing\nthe baby with the tassel of the string to the window-blind, or else\nshe would have seen the dignity which the mother's soul put into\nRuth at that moment. Sally was quelled into silence by the gentle\ncomposure, the self-command over her passionate sorrow, which gave to\nRuth an unconscious grandeur of demeanour as she came up to the old\nservant.\n\n\"Give him back to me, please. I did not know it brought ill-luck, or\nif my heart broke I would not have let a tear drop on his face--I\nnever will again. Thank you, Sally,\" as the servant relinquished him\nto her who came in the name of a mother. Sally watched Ruth's grave,\nsweet smile, as she followed up Sally's play with the tassel, and\nimitated, with all the docility inspired by love, every movement and\nsound which had amused her babe.\n\n\"Thou'lt be a mother, after all,\" said Sally, with a kind of\nadmiration of the control which Ruth was exercising over herself.\n\"But why talk of thy heart breaking? I don't question thee about\nwhat's past and gone; but now thou'rt wanting for nothing, nor thy\nchild either; the time to come is the Lord's, and in His hands; and\nyet thou goest about a-sighing and a-moaning in a way that I can't\nstand or thole.\"\n\n\"What do I do wrong?\" said Ruth; \"I try to do all I can.\"\n\n\"Yes, in a way,\" said Sally, puzzled to know how to describe her\nmeaning. \"Thou dost it--but there's a right and a wrong way of\nsetting about everything--and to my thinking, the right way is to\ntake a thing up heartily, if it is only making a bed. Why! dear ah\nme, making a bed may be done after a Christian fashion, I take it,\nor else what's to come of such as me in heaven, who've had little\nenough time on earth for clapping ourselves down on our knees for\nset prayers? When I was a girl, and wretched enough about Master\nThurstan, and the crook on his back which came of the fall I gave\nhim, I took to praying and sighing, and giving up the world; and\nI thought it were wicked to care for the flesh, so I made heavy\npuddings, and was careless about dinner and the rooms, and thought I\nwas doing my duty, though I did call myself a miserable sinner. But\none night, the old missus (Master Thurstan's mother) came in, and\nsat down by me, as I was a-scolding myself, without thinking of what\nI was saying; and, says she, 'Sally! what are you blaming yourself\nabout, and groaning over? We hear you in the parlour every night,\nand it makes my heart ache.' 'Oh, ma'am,' says I, 'I'm a miserable\nsinner, and I'm travailing in the new birth.' 'Was that the reason,'\nsays she, 'why the pudding was so heavy to-day?' 'Oh, ma'am, ma'am,'\nsaid I, 'if you would not think of the things of the flesh, but\ntrouble yourself about your immortal soul.' And I sat a-shaking my\nhead to think about her soul. 'But,' says she, in her sweet-dropping\nvoice, 'I do try to think of my soul every hour of the day, if by\nthat you mean trying to do the will of God, but we'll talk now about\nthe pudding; Master Thurstan could not eat it, and I know you'll be\nsorry for that.' Well! I was sorry, but I didn't choose to say so,\nas she seemed to expect me; so says I, 'It's a pity to see children\nbrought up to care for things of the flesh;' and then I could have\nbitten my tongue out, for the missus looked so grave, and I thought\nof my darling little lad pining for want of his food. At last, says\nshe, 'Sally, do you think God has put us into the world just to be\nselfish, and do nothing but see after our own souls? or to help one\nanother with heart and hand, as Christ did to all who wanted help?'\nI was silent, for, you see, she puzzled me. So she went on, 'What\nis that beautiful answer in your Church catechism, Sally?' I were\npleased to hear a Dissenter, as I did not think would have done it,\nspeak so knowledgeably about the catechism, and she went on: '\"to do\nmy duty in that station of life unto which it shall please God to\ncall me;\" well, your station is a servant, and it is as honourable as\na king's, if you look at it right; you are to help and serve others\nin one way, just as a king is to help others in another. Now what way\nare you to help and serve, or to do your duty, in that station of\nlife unto which it has pleased God to call you? Did it answer God's\npurpose, and serve Him, when the food was unfit for a child to eat,\nand unwholesome for any one?' Well! I would not give it up, I was so\npig-headed about my soul; so says I, 'I wish folks would be content\nwith locusts and wild honey, and leave other folks in peace to work\nout their salvation;' and I groaned out pretty loud to think of\nmissus's soul. I often think since she smiled a bit at me; but she\nsaid, 'Well, Sally, to-morrow, you shall have time to work out your\nsalvation; but as we have no locusts in England, and I don't think\nthey'd agree with Master Thurstan if we had, I will come and make the\npudding; but I shall try and do it well, not only for him to like\nit, but because everything may be done in a right way or a wrong;\nthe right way is to do it as well as we can, as in God's sight; the\nwrong is to do it in a self-seeking spirit, which either leads us to\nneglect it to follow out some device of our own for our own ends, or\nto give up too much time and thought to it both before and after the\ndoing.' Well! I thought of all old missus's words this morning, when\nI saw you making the beds. You sighed so, you could not half shake\nthe pillows; your heart was not in your work; and yet it was the duty\nGod had set you, I reckon; I know it's not the work parsons preach\nabout; though I don't think they go so far off the mark when they\nread, 'whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, that do with all thy\nmight.' Just try for a day to think of all the odd jobs as has to be\ndone well and truly as in God's sight, not just slurred over anyhow,\nand you'll go through them twice as cheerfully, and have no thought\nto spare for sighing or crying.\"\n\nSally bustled off to set on the kettle for tea, and felt half\nashamed, in the quiet of the kitchen, to think of the oration she\nhad made in the parlour. But she saw with much satisfaction, that\nhenceforward Ruth nursed her boy with a vigour and cheerfulness that\nwere reflected back from him; and the household work was no longer\nperformed with a languid indifference, as if life and duty were\ndistasteful. Miss Benson had her share in this improvement, though\nSally placidly took all the credit to herself. One day as she and\nRuth sat together, Miss Benson spoke of the child, and thence went on\nto talk about her own childhood. By degrees they spoke of education,\nand the book-learning that forms one part of it; and the result was\nthat Ruth determined to get up early all through the bright summer\nmornings, to acquire the knowledge hereafter to be given to her\nchild. Her mind was uncultivated, her reading scant; beyond the mere\nmechanical arts of education she knew nothing; but she had a refined\ntaste, and excellent sense and judgment to separate the true from\nthe false. With these qualities, she set to work under Mr Benson's\ndirections. She read in the early morning the books that he marked\nout; she trained herself with strict perseverance to do all\nthoroughly; she did not attempt to acquire any foreign language,\nalthough her ambition was to learn Latin, in order to teach it to her\nboy. Those summer mornings were happy, for she was learning neither\nto look backwards nor forwards, but to live faithfully and earnestly\nin the present. She rose while the hedge-sparrow was yet singing his\n_r\u00c3\u00a9veill\u00c3\u00a9_ to his mate; she dressed and opened her window, shading\nthe soft-blowing air and the sunny eastern light from her baby. If\nshe grew tired, she went and looked at him, and all her thoughts were\nholy prayers for him. Then she would gaze awhile out of the high\nupper window on to the moorlands, that swelled in waves one behind\nthe other, in the grey, cool morning light. These were her occasional\nrelaxations, and after them she returned with strength to her work.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nLeonard's Christening\n\n\nIn that body of Dissenters to which Mr Benson belonged, it is not\nconsidered necessary to baptize infants as early as the ceremony can\nbe performed; and many circumstances concurred to cause the solemn\nthanksgiving and dedication of the child (for so these Dissenters\nlook upon christenings) to be deferred until it was probably\nsomewhere about six months old. There had been many conversations\nin the little sitting-room between the brother and sister and their\n_proteg\u00c3\u00a9e_, which had consisted more of questions betraying a\nthoughtful wondering kind of ignorance on the part of Ruth, and\nanswers more suggestive than explanatory from Mr Benson; while Miss\nBenson kept up a kind of running commentary, always simple and often\nquaint, but with that intuition into the very heart of all things\ntruly religious which is often the gift of those who seem, at first\nsight, to be only affectionate and sensible. When Mr Benson had\nexplained his own views of what a christening ought to be considered,\nand, by calling out Ruth's latent feelings into pious earnestness,\nbrought her into a right frame of mind, he felt that he had done what\nhe could to make the ceremony more than a mere form, and to invest\nit, quiet, humble, and obscure as it must necessarily be in outward\nshape--mournful and anxious as much of its antecedents had rendered\nit--with the severe grandeur of an act done in faith and truth.\n\nIt was not far to carry the little one, for, as I said, the chapel\nalmost adjoined the minister's house. The whole procession was\nto have consisted of Mr and Miss Benson, Ruth carrying her baby,\nand Sally, who felt herself, as a Church-of-England woman, to be\ncondescending and kind in requesting leave to attend a baptism among\n\"them Dissenters;\" but unless she had asked permission, she would\nnot have been desired to attend, so careful was the habit of her\nmaster and mistress that she should be allowed that freedom which\nthey claimed for themselves. But they were glad she wished to go;\nthey liked the feeling that all were of one household, and that\nthe interests of one were the interests of all. It produced a\nconsequence, however, which they did not anticipate. Sally was full\nof the event which her presence was to sanction, and, as it were,\nto redeem from the character of being utterly schismatic; she spoke\nabout it with an air of patronage to three or four, and among them to\nsome of the servants at Mr Bradshaw's.\n\nMiss Benson was rather surprised to receive a call from Jemima\nBradshaw, on the very morning of the day on which little Leonard was\nto be baptized; Miss Bradshaw was rosy and breathless with eagerness.\nAlthough the second in the family, she had been at school when her\nyounger sisters had been christened, and she was now come, in the\nfull warmth of a girl's fancy, to ask if she might be present at the\nafternoon's service. She had been struck with Mrs Denbigh's grace\nand beauty at the very first sight, when she had accompanied her\nmother to call upon the Bensons on their return from Wales; and had\nkept up an enthusiastic interest in the widow only a little older\nthan herself, whose very reserve and retirement but added to her\nunconscious power of enchantment.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Benson! I never saw a christening; papa says I may go, if\nyou think Mr Benson and Mrs Denbigh would not dislike it; and I will\nbe quite quiet, and sit up behind the door, or anywhere; and that\nsweet little baby! I should so like to see him christened; is he to\nbe called Leonard, did you say? After Mr Denbigh, is it?\"\n\n\"No--not exactly,\" said Miss Benson, rather discomfited.\n\n\"Was not Mr Denbigh's name Leonard, then? Mamma thought it would be\nsure to be called after him, and so did I. But I may come to the\nchristening, may I not, dear Miss Benson?\"\n\nMiss Benson gave her consent with a little inward reluctance.\nBoth her brother and Ruth shared in this feeling, although no one\nexpressed it; and it was presently forgotten.\n\nJemima stood grave and quiet in the old-fashioned vestry adjoining\nthe chapel, as they entered with steps subdued to slowness. She\nthought Ruth looked so pale and awed because she was left a solitary\nparent; but Ruth came to the presence of God, as one who had gone\nastray, and doubted her own worthiness to be called His child; she\ncame as a mother who had incurred a heavy responsibility, and who\nentreated His almighty aid to enable her to discharge it; full of\npassionate, yearning love which craved for more faith in God, to\nstill her distrust and fear of the future that might hang over her\ndarling. When she thought of her boy, she sickened and trembled;\nbut when she heard of God's loving-kindness, far beyond all tender\nmother's love, she was hushed into peace and prayer. There she stood,\nher fair pale cheek resting on her baby's head, as he slumbered on\nher bosom; her eyes went slanting down under their half-closed white\nlids; but their gaze was not on the primitive cottage-like room, it\nwas earnestly fixed on a dim mist, through which she fain would have\nseen the life that lay before her child; but the mist was still and\ndense, too thick a veil for anxious human love to penetrate. The\nfuture was hid with God.\n\nMr Benson stood right under the casement window that was placed high\nup in the room; he was almost in shade, except for one or two marked\nlights which fell on hair already silvery white; his voice was always\nlow and musical when he spoke to few; it was too weak to speak so as\nto be heard by many without becoming harsh and strange; but now it\nfilled the little room with a loving sound, like the stock-dove's\nbrooding murmur over her young. He and Ruth forgot all in their\nearnestness of thought; and when he said \"Let us pray,\" and the\nlittle congregation knelt down, you might have heard the baby's faint\nbreathing, scarcely sighing out upon the stillness, so absorbed were\nall in the solemnity. But the prayer was long; thought followed\nthought, and fear crowded upon fear, and all were to be laid bare\nbefore God, and His aid and counsel asked. Before the end Sally had\nshuffled quietly out of the vestry into the green chapel-yard, upon\nwhich the door opened. Miss Benson was alive to this movement, and so\nfull of curiosity as to what it might mean that she could no longer\nattend to her brother, and felt inclined to rush off and question\nSally the moment all was ended. Miss Bradshaw hung about the babe\nand Ruth, and begged to be allowed to carry the child home, but Ruth\npressed him to her, as if there was no safe harbour for him but in\nhis mother's breast. Mr Benson saw her feeling, and caught Miss\nBradshaw's look of disappointment.\n\n\"Come home with us,\" said he, \"and stay to tea. You have never drank\ntea with us since you went to school.\"\n\n\"I wish I might,\" said Miss Bradshaw, colouring with pleasure. \"But I\nmust ask papa. May I run home and ask?\"\n\n\"To be sure, my dear!\"\n\nJemima flew off; and fortunately her father was at home; for her\nmother's permission would have been deemed insufficient. She received\nmany directions about her behaviour.\n\n\"Take no sugar in your tea, Jemima. I am sure the Bensons ought not\nto be able to afford sugar, with their means. And do not eat much;\nyou can have plenty at home on your return; remember Mrs Denbigh's\nkeep must cost them a great deal.\"\n\nSo Jemima returned considerably sobered, and very much afraid of her\nhunger leading her to forget Mr Benson's poverty. Meanwhile Miss\nBenson and Sally, acquainted with Mr Benson's invitation to Jemima,\nset about making some capital tea-cakes on which they piqued\nthemselves. They both enjoyed the offices of hospitality; and were\nglad to place some home-made tempting dainty before their guests.\n\n\"What made ye leave the chapel-vestry before my brother had ended?\"\ninquired Miss Benson.\n\n\"Indeed, ma'am, I thought master had prayed so long he'd be drouthy.\nSo I just slipped out to put on the kettle for tea.\"\n\nMiss Benson was on the point of reprimanding her for thinking of\nanything besides the object of the prayer, when she remembered how\nshe herself had been unable to attend after Sally's departure for\nwondering what had become of her; so she was silent.\n\nIt was a disappointment to Miss Benson's kind and hospitable\nexpectation when Jemima, as hungry as a hound, confined herself\nto one piece of the cake which her hostess had had such pleasure\nin making. And Jemima wished she had not a prophetic feeling all\ntea-time of the manner in which her father would inquire into the\nparticulars of the meal, elevating his eyebrows at every viand named\nbeyond plain bread-and-butter, and winding up with some such sentence\nas this: \"Well, I marvel how, with Benson's salary, he can afford to\nkeep such a table.\" Sally could have told of self-denial when no one\nwas by, when the left hand did not know what the right hand did, on\nthe part of both her master and mistress, practised without thinking\neven to themselves that it was either a sacrifice or a virtue, in\norder to enable them to help those who were in need, or even to\ngratify Miss Benson's kind, old-fashioned feelings on such occasions\nas the present, when a stranger came to the house. Her homely,\naffectionate pleasure in making others comfortable, might have shown\nthat such little occasional extravagances were not waste, but a good\nwork; and were not to be gauged by the standard of money-spending.\nThis evening her spirits were damped by Jemima's refusal to eat. Poor\nJemima! the cakes were so good, and she was so hungry; but still she\nrefused.\n\nWhile Sally was clearing away the tea-things, Miss Benson and Jemima\naccompanied Ruth upstairs, when she went to put little Leonard to\nbed.\n\n\"A christening is a very solemn service,\" said Miss Bradshaw; \"I had\nno idea it was so solemn. Mr Benson seemed to speak as if he had a\nweight of care on his heart that God alone could relieve or lighten.\"\n\n\"My brother feels these things very much,\" said Miss Benson, rather\nwishing to cut short the conversation, for she had been aware of\nseveral parts in the prayer which she knew were suggested by the\npeculiarity and sadness of the case before him.\n\n\"I could not quite follow him all through,\" continued Jemima; \"what\ndid he mean by saying, 'This child, rebuked by the world and bidden\nto stand apart, Thou wilt not rebuke, but wilt suffer it to come to\nThee and be blessed with Thine almighty blessing'? Why is this little\ndarling to be rebuked? I do not think I remember the exact words, but\nhe said something like that.\"\n\n\"My dear! your gown is dripping wet! it must have dipped into the\ntub; let me wring it out.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you! Never mind my gown!\" said Jemima, hastily, and\nwanting to return to her question; but just then she caught the sight\nof tears falling fast down the cheeks of the silent Ruth as she bent\nover her child, crowing and splashing away in his tub. With a sudden\nconsciousness that unwittingly she had touched on some painful chord,\nJemima rushed into another subject, and was eagerly seconded by Miss\nBenson. The circumstance seemed to die away, and leave no trace;\nbut in after-years it rose, vivid and significant, before Jemima's\nmemory. At present it was enough for her, if Mrs Denbigh would let\nher serve her in every possible way. Her admiration for beauty was\nkeen, and little indulged at home; and Ruth was very beautiful in her\nquiet mournfulness; her mean and homely dress left herself only the\nmore open to admiration, for she gave it a charm by her unconscious\nwearing of it that made it seem like the drapery of an old Greek\nstatue--subordinate to the figure it covered, yet imbued by it with\nan unspeakable grace. Then the pretended circumstances of her life\nwere such as to catch the imagination of a young romantic girl.\nAltogether, Jemima could have kissed her hand and professed herself\nRuth's slave. She moved away all the articles used at this little\n_coucher_; she folded up Leonard's day-clothes; she felt only too\nmuch honoured when Ruth trusted him to her for a few minutes--only\ntoo amply rewarded when Ruth thanked her with a grave, sweet smile,\nand a grateful look of her loving eyes.\n\nWhen Jemima had gone away with the servant who was sent to fetch her,\nthere was a little chorus of praise.\n\n\"She's a warm-hearted girl,\" said Miss Benson. \"She remembers all the\nold days before she went to school. She is worth two of Mr Richard.\nThey're each of them just the same as they were when they were\nchildren, when they broke that window in the chapel, and he ran\naway home, and she came knocking at our door, with a single knock,\njust like a beggar's, and I went to see who it was, and was quite\nstartled to see her round, brown, honest face looking up at me,\nhalf-frightened, and telling me what she had done, and offering me\nthe money in her savings bank to pay for it. We never should have\nheard of Master Richard's share in the business if it had not been\nfor Sally.\"\n\n\"But remember,\" said Mr Benson, \"how strict Mr Bradshaw has always\nbeen with his children. It is no wonder if poor Richard was a coward\nin those days.\"\n\n\"He is now, or I'm much mistaken,\" answered Miss Benson. \"And Mr\nBradshaw was just as strict with Jemima, and she's no coward. But\nI've no faith in Richard. He has a look about him that I don't like.\nAnd when Mr Bradshaw was away on business in Holland last year, for\nthose months my young gentleman did not come half as regularly to\nchapel, and I always believe that story of his being seen out with\nthe hounds at Smithiles.\"\n\n\"Those are neither of them great offences in a young man of twenty,\"\nsaid Mr Benson, smiling.\n\n\"No! I don't mind them in themselves; but when he could change back\nso easily to being regular and mim when his father came home, I don't\nlike that.\"\n\n\"Leonard shall never be afraid of me,\" said Ruth, following her own\ntrain of thought. \"I will be his friend from the very first; and I\nwill try and learn how to be a wise friend, and you will teach me,\nwon't you, sir?\"\n\n\"What made you wish to call him Leonard, Ruth?\" asked Miss Benson.\n\n\"It was my mother's father's name; and she used to tell me about him\nand his goodness, and I thought if Leonard could be like him--\"\n\n\"Do you remember the discussion there was about Miss Bradshaw's name,\nThurstan? Her father wanting her to be called Hepzibah, but insisting\nthat she was to have a Scripture name at any rate; and Mrs Bradshaw\nwanting her to be Juliana, after some novel she had read not long\nbefore; and at last Jemima was fixed upon, because it would do either\nfor a Scripture name or a name for a heroine out of a book.\"\n\n\"I did not know Jemima was a Scripture name,\" said Ruth.\n\n\"Oh yes, it is. One of Job's daughters; Jemima, Kezia, and\nKeren-Happuch. There are a good many Jemimas in the world, and some\nKezias, but I never heard of a Keren-Happuch; and yet we know just as\nmuch of one as of another. People really like a pretty name, whether\nin Scripture or out of it.\"\n\n\"When there is no particular association with the name,\" said Mr\nBenson.\n\n\"Now, I was called Faith after the cardinal virtue; and I like my\nname, though many people would think it too Puritan; that was\naccording to our gentle mother's pious desire. And Thurstan was\ncalled by his name because my father wished it; for, although he was\nwhat people called a radical and a democrat in his ways of talking\nand thinking, he was very proud in his heart of being descended from\nsome old Sir Thurstan, who figured away in the French wars.\"\n\n\"The difference between theory and practice, thinking and being,\" put\nin Mr Benson, who was in a mood for allowing himself a little social\nenjoyment. He leant back in his chair, with his eyes looking at,\nbut not seeing the ceiling. Miss Benson was clicking away with her\neternal knitting-needles, looking at her brother, and seeing him,\ntoo. Ruth was arranging her child's clothes against the morrow. It\nwas but their usual way of spending an evening; the variety was given\nby the different tone which the conversation assumed on the different\nnights. Yet, somehow, the peacefulness of the time, the window open\ninto the little garden, the scents that came stealing in, and the\nclear summer heaven above, made the time be remembered as a happy\nfestival by Ruth. Even Sally seemed more placid than usual when she\ncame in to prayers; and she and Miss Benson followed Ruth to her\nbedroom, to look at the beautiful sleeping Leonard.\n\n\"God bless him!\" said Miss Benson, stooping down to kiss his little\ndimpled hand, which lay outside the coverlet, tossed abroad in the\nheat of the evening.\n\n\"Now, don't get up too early, Ruth! Injuring your health will be\nshort-sighted wisdom and poor economy. Good night!\"\n\n\"Good night, dear Miss Benson. Good night, Sally.\" When Ruth had shut\nher door, she went again to the bed, and looked at her boy till her\neyes filled with tears.\n\n\"God bless thee, darling! I only ask to be one of His instruments,\nand not thrown aside as useless--or worse than useless.\"\n\nSo ended the day of Leonard's christening.\n\nMr Benson had sometimes taught the children of different people as\nan especial favour, when requested by them. But then his pupils were\nonly children, and by their progress he was little prepared for\nRuth's. She had had early teaching, of that kind which need never be\nunlearnt, from her mother; enough to unfold many of her powers; they\nhad remained inactive now for several years, but had grown strong\nin the dark and quiet time. Her tutor was surprised at the bounds\nby which she surmounted obstacles, the quick perception and ready\nadaptation of truths and first principles, and her immediate sense of\nthe fitness of things. Her delight in what was strong and beautiful\ncalled out her master's sympathy; but, most of all, he admired the\ncomplete unconsciousness of uncommon power, or unusual progress. It\nwas less of a wonder than he considered it to be, it is true, for\nshe never thought of comparing what she was now with her former self,\nmuch less with another. Indeed, she did not think of herself at all,\nbut of her boy, and what she must learn in order to teach him to be\nand to do as suited her hope and her prayer. If any one's devotion\ncould have flattered her into self-consciousness, it was Jemima's. Mr\nBradshaw never dreamed that his daughter could feel herself inferior\nto the minister's _proteg\u00c3\u00a9e_, but so it was; and no knight-errant of\nold could consider himself more honoured by his ladye's commands than\ndid Jemima, if Ruth allowed her to do anything for her or for her\nboy. Ruth loved her heartily, even while she was rather annoyed at\nthe open expressions Jemima used of admiration.\n\n\"Please, I really would rather not be told if people do think me\npretty.\"\n\n\"But it was not merely beautiful; it was sweet-looking and good, Mrs\nPostlethwaite called you,\" replied Jemima.\n\n\"All the more I would rather not hear it. I may be pretty, but I know\nI am not good. Besides, I don't think we ought to hear what is said\nof us behind our backs.\"\n\nRuth spoke so gravely, that Jemima feared lest she was displeased.\n\n\"Dear Mrs Denbigh, I never will admire or praise you again. Only let\nme love you.\"\n\n\"And let me love you!\" said Ruth, with a tender kiss.\n\nJemima would not have been allowed to come so frequently if Mr\nBradshaw had not been possessed with the idea of patronising Ruth. If\nthe latter had chosen, she might have gone dressed from head to foot\nin the presents which he wished to make her, but she refused them\nconstantly; occasionally to Miss Benson's great annoyance. But if\nhe could not load her with gifts, he could show his approbation by\nasking her to his house; and after some deliberation, she consented\nto accompany Mr and Miss Benson there. The house was square and\nmassy-looking, with a great deal of drab-colour about the furniture.\nMrs Bradshaw, in her lackadaisical, sweet-tempered way, seconded her\nhusband in his desire of being kind to Ruth; and as she cherished\nprivately a great taste for what was beautiful or interesting, as\nopposed to her husband's love of the purely useful, this taste of\nhers had rarely had so healthy and true a mode of gratification as\nwhen she watched Ruth's movements about the room, which seemed in\nits unobtrusiveness and poverty of colour to receive the requisite\nornament of light and splendour from Ruth's presence. Mrs Bradshaw\nsighed, and wished she had a daughter as lovely, about whom to weave\na romance; for castle-building, after the manner of the Minerva\npress, was the outlet by which she escaped from the pressure of her\nprosaic life, as Mr Bradshaw's wife. Her perception was only of\nexternal beauty, and she was not always alive to that, or she might\nhave seen how a warm, affectionate, ardent nature, free from all\nenvy or carking care of self, gave an unspeakable charm to her plain,\nbright-faced daughter Jemima, whose dark eyes kept challenging\nadmiration for her friend. The first evening spent at Mr Bradshaw's\npassed like many succeeding visits there. There was tea, the equipage\nfor which was as handsome and as ugly as money could purchase. Then\nthe ladies produced their sewing, while Mr Bradshaw stood before\nthe fire, and gave the assembled party the benefit of his opinions\non many subjects. The opinions were as good and excellent as the\nopinions of any man can be who sees one side of a case very strongly,\nand almost ignores the other. They coincided in many points with\nthose held by Mr Benson, but he once or twice interposed with a plea\nfor those who might differ; and then he was heard by Mr Bradshaw with\na kind of evident and indulgent pity, such as one feels for a child\nwho unwittingly talks nonsense. By-and-by, Mrs Bradshaw and Miss\nBenson fell into one _t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 t\u00c3\u00aate_, and Ruth and Jemima into another.\nTwo well-behaved but unnaturally quiet children were sent to bed\nearly in the evening, in an authoritative voice, by their father,\nbecause one of them had spoken too loud while he was enlarging on an\nalteration in the tariff. Just before the supper-tray was brought in,\na gentleman was announced whom Ruth had never previously seen, but\nwho appeared well known to the rest of the party. It was Mr Farquhar,\nMr Bradshaw's partner; he had been on the Continent for the last\nyear, and had only recently returned. He seemed perfectly at home,\nbut spoke little. He leaned back in his chair, screwed up his\neyes, and watched everybody; yet there was nothing unpleasant or\nimpertinent in his keenness of observation. Ruth wondered to hear\nhim contradict Mr Bradshaw, and almost expected some rebuff; but Mr\nBradshaw, if he did not yield the point, admitted, for the first time\nthat evening, that it was possible something might be said on the\nother side. Mr Farquhar differed also from Mr Benson, but it was in a\nmore respectful manner than Mr Bradshaw had done. For these reasons,\nalthough Mr Farquhar had never spoken to Ruth, she came away with the\nimpression that he was a man to be respected, and perhaps liked.\n\nSally would have thought herself mightily aggrieved if, on their\nreturn, she had not heard some account of the evening. As soon as\nMiss Benson came in, the old servant began:\n\n\"Well, and who was there? and what did they give you for supper?\"\n\n\"Only Mr Farquhar besides ourselves; and sandwiches, sponge-cake, and\nwine; there was no occasion for anything more,\" replied Miss Benson,\nwho was tired and preparing to go upstairs.\n\n\"Mr Farquhar! Why they do say he's thinking of Miss Jemima!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Sally! why he's old enough to be her father!\" said Miss\nBenson, half way up the first flight.\n\n\"There's no need for it to be called nonsense, though he may be\nten year older,\" muttered Sally, retreating towards the kitchen.\n\"Bradshaw's Betsy knows what she's about, and wouldn't have said it\nfor nothing.\"\n\nRuth wondered a little about it. She loved Jemima well enough to be\ninterested in what related to her; but, after thinking for a few\nminutes, she decided that such a marriage was, and would ever be,\nvery unlikely.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nRuth Becomes a Governess in Mr Bradshaw's Family\n\n\nOne afternoon, not long after this, Mr and Miss Benson set off to\ncall upon a farmer, who attended the chapel, but lived at some\ndistance from the town. They intended to stay to tea if they were\ninvited, and Ruth and Sally were left to spend a long afternoon\ntogether. At first, Sally was busy in her kitchen, and Ruth employed\nherself in carrying her baby out into the garden. It was now nearly\na year since she came to the Bensons'; it seemed like yesterday, and\nyet as if a lifetime had gone between. The flowers were budding now,\nthat were all in bloom when she came down, on the first autumnal\nmorning, into the sunny parlour. The yellow jessamine, that was then\na tender plant, had now taken firm root in the soil, and was sending\nout strong shoots; the wall-flowers, which Miss Benson had sown on\nthe wall a day or two after her arrival, were scenting the air with\ntheir fragrant flowers. Ruth knew every plant now; it seemed as\nthough she had always lived here, and always known the inhabitants\nof the house. She heard Sally singing her accustomed song in the\nkitchen, a song she never varied over her afternoon's work. It began,\n\n\n   As I was going to Derby, sir,\n     Upon a market-day.\n\n\nAnd if music is a necessary element in a song, perhaps I had better\ncall it by some other name.\n\nBut the strange change was in Ruth herself. She was conscious of\nit though she could not define it, and did not dwell upon it. Life\nhad become significant and full of duty to her. She delighted in\nthe exercise of her intellectual powers, and liked the idea of\nthe infinite amount of which she was ignorant; for it was a grand\npleasure to learn--to crave, and be satisfied. She strove to forget\nwhat had gone before this last twelve months. She shuddered up from\ncontemplating it; it was like a bad, unholy dream. And yet, there was\na strange yearning kind of love for the father of the child whom she\npressed to her heart, which came, and she could not bid it begone as\nsinful, it was so pure and natural, even when thinking of it, as in\nthe sight of God. Little Leonard cooed to the flowers, and stretched\nafter their bright colours; and Ruth laid him on the dry turf, and\npelted him with the gay petals. He chinked and crowed with laughing\ndelight, and clutched at her cap, and pulled it off. Her short rich\ncurls were golden-brown in the slanting sunlight, and by their very\nshortness made her look more child-like. She hardly seemed as if\nshe could be the mother of the noble babe over whom she knelt, now\nsnatching kisses, now matching his cheek with rose-leaves. All at\nonce, the bells of the old church struck the hour; and far away, high\nup in the air, began slowly to play the old tune of \"Life let us\ncherish;\" they had played it for years--for the life of man--and it\nalways sounded fresh and strange and a\u00c3\u00abrial. Ruth was still in a\nmoment, she knew not why; and the tears came into her eyes as she\nlistened. When it was ended, she kissed her baby, and bade God bless\nhim.\n\nJust then Sally came out, dressed for the evening, with a leisurely\nlook about her. She had done her work, and she and Ruth were to drink\ntea together in the exquisitely clean kitchen; but while the kettle\nwas boiling, she came out to enjoy the flowers. She gathered a piece\nof southern-wood, and stuffed it up her nose, by way of smelling it.\n\n\"Whatten you call this in your country?\" asked she.\n\n\"Old-man,\" replied Ruth.\n\n\"We call it here lad's-love. It and peppermint-drops always remind me\nof going to church in the country. Here! I'll get you a black-currant\nleaf to put in the teapot. It gives it a flavour. We had bees once\nagainst this wall; but when missus died, we forgot to tell 'em, and\nput 'em in mourning, and, in course, they swarmed away without our\nknowing, and the next winter came a hard frost, and they died. Now, I\ndare say, the water will be boiling; and it's time for little master\nthere to come in, for the dew is falling. See, all the daisies is\nshutting themselves up.\"\n\nSally was most gracious as a hostess. She quite put on her company\nmanners to receive Ruth in the kitchen. They laid Leonard to sleep on\nthe sofa in the parlour, that they might hear him the more easily,\nand then they sat quietly down to their sewing by the bright kitchen\nfire. Sally was, as usual, the talker; and, as usual, the subject was\nthe family of whom for so many years she had formed a part.\n\n\"Aye! things was different when I was a girl,\" quoth she. \"Eggs was\nthirty for a shilling, and butter only sixpence a pound. My wage when\nI came here was but three pound, and I did on it, and was always\nclean and tidy, which is more than many a lass can say now who gets\nher seven and eight pound a year; and tea was kept for an afternoon\ndrink, and pudding was eaten afore meat in them days, and the upshot\nwas, people paid their debts better; aye, aye! we'n gone backwards,\nand we thinken we'n gone forrards.\"\n\nAfter shaking her head a little over the degeneracy of the times,\nSally returned to a part of the subject on which she thought she had\ngiven Ruth a wrong idea.\n\n\"You'll not go for to think now that I've not more than three pound\na year. I've a deal above that now. First of all, old missus gave me\nfour pound, for she said I were worth it, and I thought in my heart\nthat I were; so I took it without more ado; but after her death,\nMaster Thurstan and Miss Faith took a fit of spending, and says they\nto me, one day as I carried tea in, 'Sally, we think your wages ought\nto be raised.' 'What matter what you think!' said I, pretty sharp,\nfor I thought they'd ha' shown more respect to missus if they'd let\nthings stand as they were in her time; and they'd gone and moved the\nsofa away from the wall to where it stands now, already that very\nday. So I speaks up sharp, and, says I, 'As long as I'm content, I\nthink it's no business of yours to be meddling wi' me and my money\nmatters.' 'But,' says Miss Faith (she's always the one to speak first\nif you'll notice, though it's master that comes in and clinches the\nmatter with some reason she'd never ha' thought of--he were always a\nsensible lad), 'Sally, all the servants in the town have six pound\nand better, and you have as hard a place as any of 'em.' 'Did you\never hear me grumble about my work that you talk about it in that\nway? wait till I grumble,' says I, 'but don't meddle wi' me till\nthen.' So I flung off in a huff; but in the course of the evening,\nMaster Thurstan came in and sat down in the kitchen, and he's such\nwinning ways he wiles one over to anything; and besides, a notion had\ncome into my head--now, you'll not tell,\" said she, glancing round\nthe room, and hitching her chair nearer to Ruth in a confidential\nmanner; Ruth promised, and Sally went on:\n\n\"I thought I should like to be an heiress wi' money, and leave it all\nto Master and Miss Faith; and I thought if I'd six pound a year I\ncould, maybe, get to be an heiress; all I was feared on was that some\nchap or other might marry me for my money, but I've managed to keep\nthe fellows off; so I looks mim and grateful, and I thanks Master\nThurstan for his offer, and I takes the wages; and what do you think\nI've done?\" asked Sally, with an exultant air.\n\n\"What have you done?\" asked Ruth.\n\n\"Why,\" replied Sally, slowly and emphatically, \"I've saved thirty\npound! but that's not it. I've getten a lawyer to make me a will;\nthat's it, wench!\" said she, slapping Ruth on the back.\n\n\"How did you manage it?\" asked Ruth.\n\n\"Aye, that was it,\" said Sally; \"I thowt about it many a night before\nI hit on the right way. I was afeard the money might be thrown into\nChancery, if I didn't make it all safe, and yet I could na' ask\nMaster Thurstan. At last and at length, John Jackson, the grocer, had\na nephew come to stay a week with him, as was 'prentice to a lawyer\nin Liverpool; so now was my time, and here was my lawyer. Wait a\nminute! I could tell you my story better if I had my will in my hand;\nand I'll scomfish you if ever you go for to tell.\"\n\nShe held up her hand, and threatened Ruth as she left the kitchen to\nfetch the will.\n\nWhen she came back, she brought a parcel tied up in a blue\npocket-handkerchief; she sat down, squared her knees, untied the\nhandkerchief, and displayed a small piece of parchment.\n\n\"Now, do you know what this is?\" said she, holding it up. \"It's\nparchment, and it's the right stuff to make wills on. People gets\ninto Chancery if they don't make them o' this stuff, and I reckon Tom\nJackson thowt he'd have a fresh job on it if he could get it into\nChancery; for the rascal went and wrote it on a piece of paper at\nfirst, and came and read it me out loud off a piece of paper no\nbetter than what one writes letters upon. I were up to him; and,\nthinks I, Come, come, my lad, I'm not a fool, though you may think\nso; I know a paper will won't stand, but I'll let you run your rig.\nSo I sits and I listens. And would you belie' me, he read it out as\nif it were as clear a business as your giving me that thimble--no\nmore ado, though it were thirty pound! I could understand it\nmysel'--that were no law for me. I wanted summat to consider about,\nand for th' meaning to be wrapped up as I wrap up my best gown. So\nsays I, 'Tom! it's not on parchment. I mun have it on parchment.'\n'This 'ill do as well,' says he. 'We'll get it witnessed, and it will\nstand good.' Well! I liked the notion of having it witnessed, and for\na while that soothed me; but after a bit, I felt I should like it\ndone according to law, and not plain out as anybody might ha' done\nit; I mysel', if I could have written. So says I, 'Tom! I mun have it\non parchment.' 'Parchment costs money,' says he, very grave. 'Oh, oh,\nmy lad! are ye there?' thinks I. 'That's the reason I'm clipped of\nlaw.' So says I, 'Tom! I mun have it on parchment. I'll pay the money\nand welcome. It's thirty pound, and what I can lay to it. I'll make\nit safe. It shall be on parchment, and I'll tell thee what, lad!\nI'll gie ye sixpence for every good law-word you put in it, sounding\nlike, and not to be caught up as a person runs. Your master had need\nto be ashamed of you as a 'prentice if you can't do a thing more\ntradesman-like than this!' Well! he laughed above a bit, but I were\nfirm, and stood to it. So he made it out on parchment. Now, woman,\ntry and read it!\" said she, giving it to Ruth.\n\nRuth smiled, and began to read; Sally listening with rapt attention.\nWhen Ruth came to the word \"testatrix,\" Sally stopped her.\n\n\"That was the first sixpence,\" said she. \"I thowt he was going to fob\nme off again wi' plain language; but when that word came, I out wi'\nmy sixpence, and gave it to him on the spot. Now go on.\"\n\nPresently Ruth read, \"accruing.\"\n\n\"That was the second sixpence. Four sixpences it were in all, besides\nsix-and-eightpence as we bargained at first, and three-and-fourpence\nparchment. There! that's what I call a will; witnessed according to\nlaw, and all. Master Thurstan will be prettily taken in when I die,\nand he finds all his extra wage left back to him. But it will teach\nhim it's not so easy as he thinks for, to make a woman give up her\nway.\"\n\nThe time was now drawing near when little Leonard might be\nweaned--the time appointed by all three for Ruth to endeavour to\nsupport herself in some way more or less independent of Mr and Miss\nBenson. This prospect dwelt much in all of their minds, and was in\neach shaded with some degree of perplexity; but they none of them\nspoke of it for fear of accelerating the event. If they had felt\nclear and determined as to the best course to be pursued, they were\nnone of them deficient in courage to commence upon that course at\nonce. Miss Benson would, perhaps, have objected the most to any\nalteration in their present daily mode of life; but that was because\nshe had the habit of speaking out her thoughts as they arose, and she\nparticularly disliked and dreaded change. Besides this, she had felt\nher heart open out, and warm towards the little helpless child, in a\nstrong and powerful manner. Nature had intended her warm instincts\nto find vent in a mother's duties; her heart had yearned after\nchildren, and made her restless in her childless state, without her\nwell knowing why; but now, the delight she experienced in tending,\nnursing, and contriving for the little boy--even contriving to the\npoint of sacrificing many of her cherished whims--made her happy\nand satisfied and peaceful. It was more difficult to sacrifice her\nwhims than her comforts; but all had been given up when and where\nrequired by the sweet lordly baby, who reigned paramount in his very\nhelplessness.\n\nFrom some cause or other, an exchange of ministers for one Sunday was\nto be effected with a neighbouring congregation, and Mr Benson went\non a short absence from home. When he returned on Monday, he was met\nat the house-door by his sister, who had evidently been looking out\nfor him for some time. She stepped out to greet him.\n\n\"Don't hurry yourself, Thurstan! all's well; only I wanted to tell\nyou something. Don't fidget yourself--baby is quite well, bless him!\nIt's only good news. Come into your room, and let me talk a little\nquietly with you.\"\n\nShe drew him into his study, which was near the outer door, and\nthen she took off his coat, and put his carpet-bag in a corner, and\nwheeled a chair to the fire, before she would begin.\n\n\"Well, now! to think how often things fall out just as we want them,\nThurstan! Have not you often wondered what was to be done with Ruth\nwhen the time came at which we promised her she should earn her\nliving? I am sure you have, because I have so often thought about it\nmyself. And yet I never dared to speak out my fear, because that\nseemed giving it a shape. And now Mr Bradshaw has put all to rights.\nHe invited Mr Jackson to dinner yesterday, just as we were going into\nchapel; and then he turned to me and asked me if I would come to\ntea--straight from afternoon chapel, because Mrs Bradshaw wanted\nto speak to me. He made it very clear I was not to bring Ruth; and,\nindeed, she was only too happy to stay at home with baby. And so I\nwent; and Mrs Bradshaw took me into her bedroom, and shut the doors,\nand said Mr Bradshaw had told her, that he did not like Jemima being\nso much confined with the younger ones while they were at their\nlessons, and that he wanted some one above a nursemaid to sit with\nthem while their masters were there--some one who would see about\ntheir learning their lessons, and who would walk out with them; a\nsort of nursery governess, I think she meant, though she did not\nsay so; and Mr Bradshaw (for, of course, I saw his thoughts and\nwords constantly peeping out, though he had told her to speak to me)\nbelieved that our Ruth would be the very person. Now, Thurstan, don't\nlook so surprised, as if she had never come into your head! I am sure\nI saw what Mrs Bradshaw was driving at, long before she came to the\npoint; and I could scarcely keep from smiling, and saying, 'We'd jump\nat the proposal'--long before I ought to have known anything about\nit.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wonder what we ought to do!\" said Mr Benson. \"Or rather, I\nbelieve I see what we ought to do, if I durst but do it.\"\n\n\"Why, what ought we to do?\" asked his sister, in surprise.\n\n\"I ought to go and tell Mr Bradshaw the whole story--\"\n\n\"And get Ruth turned out of our house,\" said Miss Benson,\nindignantly.\n\n\"They can't make us do that,\" said her brother. \"I do not think they\nwould try.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr Bradshaw would try; and he would blazon out poor Ruth's\nsin, and there would not be a chance for her left. I know him well,\nThurstan; and why should he be told now, more than a year ago?\"\n\n\"A year ago he did not want to put her in a situation of trust about\nhis children.\"\n\n\"And you think she'll abuse that trust, do you? You've lived a\ntwelvemonth in the house with Ruth, and the end of it is, you think\nshe will do his children harm! Besides, who encouraged Jemima to come\nto the house so much to see Ruth? Did you not say it would do them\nboth good to see something of each other?\"\n\nMr Benson sat thinking.\n\n\"If you had not known Ruth as well as you do--if during her stay\nwith us you had marked anything wrong, or forward, or deceitful, or\nimmodest, I would say at once, 'Don't allow Mr Bradshaw to take her\ninto his house;' but still I would say, 'Don't tell of her sin and\nher sorrow to so severe a man--so unpitiful a judge.' But here I\nask you, Thurstan, can you, or I, or Sally (quick-eyed as she is),\nsay, that in any one thing we have had true, just occasion to find\nfault with Ruth? I don't mean that she is perfect--she acts without\nthinking, her temper is sometimes warm and hasty; but have we any\nright to go and injure her prospects for life, by telling Mr Bradshaw\nall we know of her errors--only sixteen when she did so wrong, and\nnever to escape from it all her many years to come--to have the\ndespair which would arise from its being known, clutching her back\ninto worse sin? What harm do you think she can do? What is the risk\nto which you think you are exposing Mr Bradshaw's children?\" She\npaused, out of breath, her eyes glittering with tears of indignation,\nand impatient for an answer, that she might knock it to pieces.\n\n\"I do not see any danger that can arise,\" said he at length, and with\nslow difficulty, as if not fully convinced. \"I have watched Ruth, and\nI believe she is pure and truthful; and the very sorrow and penitence\nshe has felt--the very suffering she has gone through--has given her\na thoughtful conscientiousness beyond her age.\"\n\n\"That and the care of her baby,\" said Miss Benson, secretly delighted\nat the tone of her brother's thoughts.\n\n\"Ah, Faith! that baby you so much dreaded once, is turning out a\nblessing, you see,\" said Thurstan, with a faint, quiet smile.\n\n\"Yes! any one might be thankful, and better too, for Leonard; but how\ncould I tell that it would be like him?\"\n\n\"But to return to Ruth and Mr Bradshaw. What did you say?\"\n\n\"Oh! with my feelings, of course, I was only too glad to accept the\nproposal, and so I told Mrs Bradshaw then; and I afterwards repeated\nit to Mr Bradshaw, when he asked me if his wife had mentioned their\nplans. They would understand that I must consult you and Ruth, before\nit could be considered as finally settled.\"\n\n\"And have you named it to her?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Miss Benson, half afraid lest he should think she had\nbeen too precipitate.\n\n\"And what did she say?\" asked he, after a little pause of grave\nsilence.\n\n\"At first she seemed very glad, and fell into my mood of planning how\nit should all be managed; how Sally and I should take care of the\nbaby the hours that she was away at Mr Bradshaw's; but by-and-by she\nbecame silent and thoughtful, and knelt down by me and hid her face\nin my lap, and shook a little as if she was crying; and then I heard\nher speak in a very low smothered voice, for her head was still bent\ndown--quite hanging down, indeed, so that I could not see her face,\nso I stooped to listen, and I heard her say, 'Do you think I should\nbe good enough to teach little girls, Miss Benson?' She said it so\nhumbly and fearfully that all I thought of was how to cheer her, and\nI answered and asked her if she did not hope to be good enough to\nbring up her own darling to be a brave Christian man? And she lifted\nup her head, and I saw her eyes looking wild and wet and earnest, and\nshe said, 'With God's help, that will I try to make my child.' And I\nsaid then, 'Ruth, as you strive and as you pray for your own child,\nso you must strive and pray to make Mary and Elizabeth good, if you\nare trusted with them.' And she said out quite clear, though her face\nwas hidden from me once more, 'I will strive, and I will pray.' You\nwould not have had any fears, Thurstan, if you could have heard and\nseen her last night.\"\n\n\"I have no fear,\" said he, decidedly. \"Let the plan go on.\" After\na minute, he added, \"But I am glad it was so far arranged before I\nheard of it. My indecision about right and wrong--my perplexity as to\nhow far we are to calculate consequences--grows upon me, I fear.\"\n\n\"You look tired and weary, dear. You should blame your body rather\nthan your conscience at these times.\"\n\n\"A very dangerous doctrine.\"\n\nThe scroll of Fate was closed, and they could not foresee the Future;\nand yet, if they could have seen it, though they might have shrunk\nfearfully at first, they would have smiled and thanked God when all\nwas done and said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nAfter Five Years\n\n\nThe quiet days grew into weeks and months, and even years, without\nany event to startle the little circle into the consciousness of the\nlapse of time. One who had known them at the date of Ruth's becoming\na governess in Mr Bradshaw's family, and had been absent until the\ntime of which I am now going to tell you, would have noted some\nchanges which had imperceptibly come over all; but he, too, would\nhave thought, that the life which had brought so little of turmoil\nand vicissitude must have been calm and tranquil, and in accordance\nwith the bygone activity of the town in which their existence passed\naway.\n\nThe alterations that he would have perceived were those caused by\nthe natural progress of time. The Benson home was brightened into\nvividness by the presence of the little Leonard, now a noble boy of\nsix, large and grand in limb and stature, and with a face of marked\nbeauty and intelligence. Indeed, he might have been considered by\nmany as too intelligent for his years; and often the living with old\nand thoughtful people gave him, beyond most children, the appearance\nof pondering over the mysteries which meet the young on the threshold\nof life, but which fade away as advancing years bring us more into\ncontact with the practical and tangible--fade away and vanish, until\nit seems to require the agitation of some great storm of the soul\nbefore we can again realise spiritual things.\n\nBut, at times, Leonard seemed oppressed and bewildered, after\nlistening intent, with grave and wondering eyes, to the conversation\naround him; at others, the bright animal life shone forth radiant,\nand no three-months' kitten--no foal, suddenly tossing up its heels\nby the side of its sedate dam, and careering around the pasture in\npure mad enjoyment--no young creature of any kind, could show more\nmerriment and gladness of heart.\n\n\"For ever in mischief,\" was Sally's account of him at such times;\nbut it was not intentional mischief; and Sally herself would have\nbeen the first to scold any one else who had used the same words in\nreference to her darling. Indeed, she was once nearly giving warning,\nbecause she thought the boy was being ill-used. The occasion was\nthis: Leonard had for some time shown a strange, odd disregard of\ntruth; he invented stories, and told them with so grave a face, that\nunless there was some internal evidence of their incorrectness (such\nas describing a cow with a bonnet on), he was generally believed, and\nhis statements, which were given with the full appearance of relating\na real occurrence, had once or twice led to awkward results. All the\nthree, whose hearts were pained by this apparent unconsciousness of\nthe difference between truth and falsehood, were unaccustomed to\nchildren, or they would have recognised this as a stage through which\nmost infants, who have lively imaginations, pass; and, accordingly,\nthere was a consultation in Mr Benson's study one morning. Ruth was\nthere, quiet, very pale, and with compressed lips, sick at heart as\nshe heard Miss Benson's arguments for the necessity of whipping, in\norder to cure Leonard of his story-telling. Mr Benson looked unhappy\nand uncomfortable. Education was but a series of experiments to them\nall, and they all had a secret dread of spoiling the noble boy, who\nwas the darling of their hearts. And, perhaps, this very intensity of\nlove begot an impatient, unnecessary anxiety, and made them resolve\non sterner measures than the parent of a large family (where love\nwas more spread abroad) would have dared to use. At any rate, the\nvote for whipping carried the day; and even Ruth, trembling and cold,\nagreed that it must be done; only she asked, in a meek, sad voice, if\nshe need be present (Mr Benson was to be the executioner--the scene,\nthe study); and being instantly told that she had better not, she\nwent slowly and languidly up to her room, and kneeling down, she\nclosed her ears, and prayed.\n\nMiss Benson, having carried her point, was very sorry for the child,\nand would have begged him off; but Mr Benson had listened more to her\narguments than now to her pleadings, and only answered, \"If it is\nright, it shall be done!\" He went into the garden, and deliberately,\nalmost as if he wished to gain time, chose and cut off a little\nswitch from the laburnum-tree. Then he returned through the kitchen,\nand gravely taking the awed and wondering little fellow by the hand,\nhe led him silently into the study, and placing him before him, began\nan admonition on the importance of truthfulness, meaning to conclude\nwith what he believed to be the moral of all punishment: \"As you\ncannot remember this of yourself, I must give you a little pain to\nmake you remember it. I am very sorry it is necessary, and that you\ncannot recollect without my doing so.\"\n\nBut before he had reached this very proper and desirable conclusion,\nand while he was yet working his way, his heart aching with the\nterrified look of the child at the solemnly sad face and words of\nupbraiding, Sally burst in:\n\n\"And what may ye be going to do with that fine switch I saw ye\ngathering, Master Thurstan?\" asked she, her eyes gleaming with anger\nat the answer she knew must come, if answer she had at all.\n\n\"Go away, Sally,\" said Mr Benson, annoyed at the fresh difficulty in\nhis path.\n\n\"I'll not stir never a step till you give me that switch, as you've\ngot for some mischief, I'll be bound.\"\n\n\"Sally! remember where it is said, 'He that spareth the rod, spoileth\nthe child,'\" said Mr Benson, austerely.\n\n\"Aye, I remember; and I remember a bit more than you want me to\nremember, I reckon. It were King Solomon as spoke them words, and it\nwere King Solomon's son that were King Rehoboam, and no great shakes\neither. I can remember what is said on him, 2 Chronicles, xii.\nchapter, 14th verse: 'And he,' that's King Rehoboam, the lad that\ntasted the rod, 'did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek\nthe Lord.' I've not been reading my chapters every night for fifty\nyear to be caught napping by a Dissenter, neither!\" said she,\ntriumphantly. \"Come along, Leonard.\" She stretched out her hand to\nthe child, thinking that she had conquered.\n\nBut Leonard did not stir. He looked wistfully at Mr Benson. \"Come!\"\nsaid she, impatiently. The boy's mouth quivered.\n\n\"If you want to whip me, uncle, you may do it. I don't much mind.\"\n\nPut in this form, it was impossible to carry out his intentions; and\nso Mr Benson told the lad he might go--that he would speak to him\nanother time. Leonard went away, more subdued in spirit than if he\nhad been whipped. Sally lingered a moment. She stopped to add: \"I\nthink it's for them without sin to throw stones at a poor child, and\ncut up good laburnum-branches to whip him. I only do as my betters\ndo, when I call Leonard's mother Mrs Denbigh.\" The moment she had\nsaid this she was sorry; it was an ungenerous advantage after the\nenemy had acknowledged himself defeated. Mr Benson dropped his head\nupon his hands, and hid his face, and sighed deeply.\n\nLeonard flew in search of his mother, as in search of a refuge. If\nhe had found her calm, he would have burst into a passion of crying\nafter his agitation; as it was, he came upon her kneeling and\nsobbing, and he stood quite still. Then he threw his arms round her\nneck, and said: \"Mamma! mamma! I will be good--I make a promise; I\nwill speak true--I make a promise.\" And he kept his word.\n\nMiss Benson piqued herself upon being less carried away by her love\nfor this child than any one else in the house; she talked severely,\nand had capital theories; but her severity ended in talk, and\nher theories would not work. However, she read several books on\neducation, knitting socks for Leonard all the while; and, upon the\nwhole, I think, the hands were more usefully employed than the head,\nand the good honest heart better than either. She looked older than\nwhen we first knew her, but it was a ripe, kindly age that was coming\nover her. Her excellent practical sense, perhaps, made her a more\nmasculine character than her brother. He was often so much perplexed\nby the problems of life, that he let the time for action go by; but\nshe kept him in check by her clear, pithy talk, which brought back\nhis wandering thoughts to the duty that lay straight before him,\nwaiting for action; and then he remembered that it was the faithful\npart to \"wait patiently upon God,\" and leave the ends in His hands,\nwho alone knows why Evil exists in this world, and why it ever hovers\non either side of Good. In this respect, Miss Benson had more faith\nthan her brother--or so it seemed; for quick, resolute action in the\nnext step of Life was all she required, while he deliberated and\ntrembled, and often did wrong from his very deliberation, when his\nfirst instinct would have led him right.\n\nBut although decided and prompt as ever, Miss Benson was grown older\nsince the summer afternoon when she dismounted from the coach at the\nfoot of the long Welsh hill that led to Llan-dhu, where her brother\nawaited her to consult her about Ruth. Though her eye was as bright\nand straight-looking as ever, quick and brave in its glances, her\nhair had become almost snowy white; and it was on this point she\nconsulted Sally, soon after the date of Leonard's last untruth.\nThe two were arranging Miss Benson's room one morning, when, after\ndusting the looking-glass, she suddenly stopped in her operation, and\nafter a close inspection of herself, startled Sally by this speech:\n\n\"Sally! I'm looking a great deal older than I used to do!\"\n\nSally, who was busy dilating on the increased price of flour,\nconsidered this remark of Miss Benson's as strangely irrelevant to\nthe matter in hand, and only noticed it by a\n\n\"To be sure! I suppose we all on us do. But two-and-fourpence a dozen\nis too much to make us pay for it.\"\n\nMiss Benson went on with her inspection of herself, and Sally with\nher economical projects.\n\n\"Sally!\" said Miss Benson, \"my hair is nearly white. The last time I\nlooked it was only pepper-and-salt. What must I do?\"\n\n\"Do--why, what would the wench do?\" asked Sally, contemptuously.\n\"Ye're never going to be taken in, at your time of life, by hair-dyes\nand such gimcracks, as can only take in young girls whose\nwisdom-teeth are not cut.\"\n\n\"And who are not very likely to want them,\" said Miss Benson,\nquietly. \"No! but you see, Sally, it's very awkward having such grey\nhair, and feeling so young. Do you know, Sally, I've as great a mind\nfor dancing, when I hear a lively tune on the street-organs, as ever;\nand as great a mind to sing when I'm happy--to sing in my old way,\nSally, you know.\"\n\n\"Aye, you had it from a girl,\" said Sally; \"and many a time, when the\ndoor's been shut, I did not know if it was you in the parlour, or a\nbig bumble-bee in the kitchen, as was making that drumbling noise. I\nheard you at it yesterday.\"\n\n\"But an old woman with grey hair ought not to have a fancy for\ndancing or singing,\" continued Miss Benson.\n\n\"Whatten nonsense are ye talking?\" said Sally, roused to indignation.\n\"Calling yoursel' an old woman when you're better than ten years\nyounger than me! and many a girl has grey hair at five-and-twenty.\"\n\n\"But I'm more than five-and-twenty, Sally. I'm fifty-seven next May!\"\n\n\"More shame for ye, then, not to know better than to talk of dyeing\nyour hair. I cannot abide such vanities!\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! Sally, when will you understand what I mean? I want to\nknow how I am to keep remembering how old I am, so as to prevent\nmyself from feeling so young? I was quite startled just now to see my\nhair in the glass, for I can generally tell if my cap is straight by\nfeeling. I'll tell you what I'll do--I'll cut off a piece of my grey\nhair, and plait it together for a marker in my Bible!\" Miss Benson\nexpected applause for this bright idea, but Sally only made answer:\n\n\"You'll be taking to painting your cheeks next, now you've once\nthought of dyeing your hair.\" So Miss Benson plaited her grey hair in\nsilence and quietness, Leonard holding one end of it while she wove\nit, and admiring the colour and texture all the time, with a sort of\nimplied dissatisfaction at the auburn colour of his own curls, which\nwas only half-comforted away by Miss Benson's information, that, if\nhe lived long enough, his hair would be like hers.\n\nMr Benson, who had looked old and frail while he was yet but young,\nwas now stationary as to the date of his appearance. But there was\nsomething more of nervous restlessness in his voice and ways than\nformerly; that was the only change six years had brought to him.\nAnd as for Sally, she chose to forget age and the passage of years\naltogether, and had as much work in her, to use her own expression,\nas she had at sixteen; nor was her appearance very explicit as to the\nflight of time. Fifty, sixty, or seventy, she might be--not more than\nthe last, not less than the first--though her usual answer to any\ncircuitous inquiry as to her age was now (what it had been for many\nyears past), \"I'm feared I shall never see thirty again.\"\n\nThen as to the house. It was not one where the sitting-rooms are\nrefurnished every two or three years; not now, even (since Ruth came\nto share their living) a place where, as an article grew shabby or\nworn, a new one was purchased. The furniture looked poor, and the\ncarpets almost threadbare; but there was such a dainty spirit of\ncleanliness abroad, such exquisite neatness of repair, and altogether\nso bright and cheerful a look about the rooms--everything so\nabove-board--no shifts to conceal poverty under flimsy ornament--that\nmany a splendid drawing-room would give less pleasure to those who\ncould see evidences of character in inanimate things. But whatever\npoverty there might be in the house, there was full luxuriance in\nthe little square wall-encircled garden, on two sides of which the\nparlour and kitchen looked. The laburnum-tree, which when Ruth came\nwas like a twig stuck into the ground, was now a golden glory in\nspring, and a pleasant shade in summer. The wild hop, that Mr Benson\nhad brought home from one of his country rambles, and planted by the\nparlour-window, while Leonard was yet a baby in his mother's arms,\nwas now a garland over the casement, hanging down long tendrils,\nthat waved in the breezes, and threw pleasant shadows and traceries,\nlike some Bacchanalian carving, on the parlour-walls, at \"morn or\ndusky eve.\" The yellow rose had clambered up to the window of Mr\nBenson's bedroom, and its blossom-laden branches were supported by a\njargonelle pear-tree rich in autumnal fruit.\n\nBut, perhaps, in Ruth herself there was the greatest external change;\nfor of the change which had gone on in her heart, and mind, and soul,\nor if there had been any, neither she nor any one around her was\nconscious; but sometimes Miss Benson did say to Sally, \"How very\nhandsome Ruth is grown!\" To which Sally made ungracious answer, \"Yes!\nshe's well enough. Beauty is deceitful, and favour a snare, and I'm\nthankful the Lord has spared me from such man-traps and spring-guns.\"\nBut even Sally could not help secretly admiring Ruth. If her early\nbrilliancy of colour was gone, a clear ivory skin, as smooth as\nsatin, told of complete and perfect health, and was as lovely, if not\nso striking in effect, as the banished lilies and roses. Her hair had\ngrown darker and deeper, in the shadow that lingered in its masses;\nher eyes, even if you could have guessed that they had shed bitter\ntears in their day, had a thoughtful, spiritual look about them,\nthat made you wonder at their depth, and look--and look again. The\nincrease of dignity in her face had been imparted to her form. I do\nnot know if she had grown taller since the birth of her child, but\nshe looked as if she had. And although she had lived in a very humble\nhome, yet there was something about either it or her, or the people\namongst whom she had been thrown during the last few years, which had\nso changed her, that whereas, six or seven years ago, you would have\nperceived that she was not altogether a lady by birth and education,\nyet now she might have been placed among the highest in the land, and\nwould have been taken by the most critical judge for their equal,\nalthough ignorant of their conventional etiquette--an ignorance\nwhich she would have acknowledged in a simple child-like way, being\nunconscious of any false shame.\n\nHer whole heart was in her boy. She often feared that she loved him\ntoo much--more than God Himself--yet she could not bear to pray to\nhave her love for her child lessened. But she would kneel down by his\nlittle bed at night--at the deep, still midnight--with the stars that\nkept watch over Rizpah shining down upon her, and tell God what I\nhave now told you, that she feared she loved her child too much,\nyet could not, would not, love him less; and speak to Him of her\none treasure as she could speak to no earthly friend. And so,\nunconsciously, her love for her child led her up to love to God, to\nthe All-knowing, who read her heart.\n\nIt might be superstition--I dare say it was--but, somehow, she never\nlay down to rest without saying, as she looked her last on her boy,\n\"Thy will, not mine, be done;\" and even while she trembled and shrank\nwith infinite dread from sounding the depths of what that will might\nbe, she felt as if her treasure were more secure to waken up rosy and\nbright in the morning, as one over whose slumbers God's holy angels\nhad watched, for the very words which she had turned away in sick\nterror from realising the night before.\n\nHer daily absence at her duties to the Bradshaw children only\nministered to her love for Leonard. Everything does minister to love\nwhen its foundation lies deep in a true heart, and it was with an\nexquisite pang of delight that, after a moment of vague fear,\n\n\n   (Oh, mercy! to myself I said,\n   If Lucy should be dead!),\n\n\nshe saw her child's bright face of welcome as he threw open the door\nevery afternoon on her return home. For it was his silently-appointed\nwork to listen for her knock, and rush breathless to let her in.\nIf he were in the garden, or upstairs among the treasures of the\nlumber-room, either Miss Benson, or her brother, or Sally, would\nfetch him to his happy little task; no one so sacred as he to the\nallotted duty. And the joyous meeting was not deadened by custom, to\neither mother or child.\n\nRuth gave the Bradshaws the highest satisfaction, as Mr Bradshaw\noften said both to her and to the Bensons; indeed, she rather winced\nunder his pompous approbation. But his favourite recreation was\npatronising; and when Ruth saw how quietly and meekly Mr Benson\nsubmitted to gifts and praise, when an honest word of affection, or\na tacit, implied acknowledgment of equality, would have been worth\neverything said and done, she tried to be more meek in spirit, and\nto recognise the good that undoubtedly existed in Mr Bradshaw. He\nwas richer and more prosperous than ever;--a keen, far-seeing man\nof business, with an undisguised contempt for all who failed in the\nsuccess which he had achieved. But it was not alone those who were\nless fortunate in obtaining wealth than himself that he visited with\nseverity of judgment; every moral error or delinquency came under his\nunsparing comment. Stained by no vice himself, either in his own eyes\nor in that of any human being who cared to judge him, having nicely\nand wisely proportioned and adapted his means to his ends, he\ncould afford to speak and act with a severity which was almost\nsanctimonious in its ostentation of thankfulness as to himself. Not a\nmisfortune or a sin was brought to light but Mr Bradshaw could trace\nit to its cause in some former mode of action, which he had long ago\nforetold would lead to shame. If another's son turned out wild or\nbad, Mr Bradshaw had little sympathy; it might have been prevented\nby a stricter rule, or more religious life at home; young Richard\nBradshaw was quiet and steady, and other fathers might have had\nsons like him if they had taken the same pains to enforce obedience.\nRichard was an only son, and yet Mr Bradshaw might venture to say, he\nhad never had his own way in his life. Mrs Bradshaw was, he confessed\n(Mr Bradshaw did not dislike confessing his wife's errors), rather\nless firm than he should have liked with the girls; and with some\npeople, he believed, Jemima was rather headstrong; but to his wishes\nshe had always shown herself obedient. All children were obedient,\nif their parents were decided and authoritative; and every one would\nturn out well, if properly managed. If they did not prove good, they\nmust take the consequences of their errors.\n\nMrs Bradshaw murmured faintly at her husband when his back was\nturned; but if his voice was heard, or his footsteps sounded in the\ndistance, she was mute, and hurried her children into the attitude or\naction most pleasing to their father. Jemima, it is true, rebelled\nagainst this manner of proceeding, which savoured to her a little of\ndeceit; but even she had not, as yet, overcome her awe of her father\nsufficiently to act independently of him, and according to her own\nsense of right--or rather, I should say, according to her own warm,\npassionate impulses. Before him the wilfulness which made her dark\neyes blaze out at times was hushed and still; he had no idea of her\nself-tormenting, no notion of the almost southern jealousy which\nseemed to belong to her brunette complexion. Jemima was not pretty;\nthe flatness and shortness of her face made her almost plain; yet\nmost people looked twice at her expressive countenance, at the eyes\nwhich flamed or melted at every trifle, at the rich colour which\ncame at every expressed emotion into her usually sallow face, at\nthe faultless teeth which made her smile like a sunbeam. But then,\nagain, when she thought she was not kindly treated, when a suspicion\ncrossed her mind, or when she was angry with herself, her lips were\ntight-pressed together, her colour was wan and almost livid, and a\nstormy gloom clouded her eyes as with a film. But before her father\nher words were few, and he did not notice looks or tones.\n\nHer brother Richard had been equally silent before his father in\nboyhood and early youth; but since he had gone to be clerk in a\nLondon house, preparatory to assuming his place as junior partner in\nMr Bradshaw's business, he spoke more on his occasional visits at\nhome. And very proper and highly moral was his conversation; set\nsentences of goodness, which were like the flowers that children\nstick in the ground, and that have not sprung upwards from\nroots--deep down in the hidden life and experience of the heart. He\nwas as severe a judge as his father of other people's conduct, but\nyou felt that Mr Bradshaw was sincere in his condemnation of all\noutward error and vice, and that he would try himself by the same\nlaws as he tried others; somehow, Richard's words were frequently\nheard with a lurking distrust, and many shook their heads over the\npattern son; but then it was those whose sons had gone astray, and\nbeen condemned, in no private or tender manner, by Mr Bradshaw, so it\nmight be revenge in them. Still, Jemima felt that all was not right;\nher heart sympathised in the rebellion against his father's commands,\nwhich her brother had confessed to her in an unusual moment of\nconfidence, but her uneasy conscience condemned the deceit which he\nhad practised.\n\nThe brother and sister were sitting alone over a blazing Christmas\nfire, and Jemima held an old newspaper in her hand to shield her\nface from the hot light. They were talking of family events, when,\nduring a pause, Jemima's eye caught the name of a great actor,\nwho had lately given prominence and life to a character in one of\nShakspeare's plays. The criticism in the paper was fine, and warmed\nJemima's heart.\n\n\"How I should like to see a play!\" exclaimed she.\n\n\"Should you?\" said her brother, listlessly.\n\n\"Yes, to be sure! Just hear this!\" and she began to read a fine\npassage of criticism.\n\n\"Those newspaper people can make an article out of anything,\" said\nhe, yawning. \"I've seen the man myself, and it was all very well, but\nnothing to make such a fuss about.\"\n\n\"You! you seen ----! Have you seen a play, Richard? Oh, why did you\nnever tell me before? Tell me all about it! Why did you never name\nseeing ---- in your letters?\"\n\nHe half smiled, contemptuously enough. \"Oh! at first it strikes one\nrather, but after a while one cares no more for the theatre than one\ndoes for mince-pies.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wish I might go to London!\" said Jemima, impatiently. \"I've a\ngreat mind to ask papa to let me go to the George Smiths', and then I\ncould see ----. I would not think him like mince-pies.\"\n\n\"You must not do any such thing!\" said Richard, now neither yawning\nnor contemptuous. \"My father would never allow you to go to the\ntheatre; and the George Smiths are such old fogeys--they would be\nsure to tell.\"\n\n\"How do you go, then? Does my father give you leave?\"\n\n\"Oh! many things are right for men which are not for girls.\"\n\nJemima sat and pondered. Richard wished he had not been so\nconfidential.\n\n\"You need not name it,\" said he, rather anxiously.\n\n\"Name what?\" said she, startled, for her thoughts had gone far\nafield.\n\n\"Oh, name my going once or twice to the theatre!\"\n\n\"No, I shan't name it!\" said she. \"No one here would care to hear\nit.\"\n\nBut it was with some little surprise, and almost with a feeling of\ndisgust, that she heard Richard join with her father in condemning\nsome one, and add to Mr Bradshaw's list of offences, by alleging that\nthe young man was a playgoer. He did not think his sister heard his\nwords.\n\nMary and Elizabeth were the two girls whom Ruth had in charge; they\nresembled Jemima more than their brother in character. The household\nrules were occasionally a little relaxed in their favour, for Mary,\nthe elder, was nearly eight years younger than Jemima, and three\nintermediate children had died. They loved Ruth dearly, made a great\npet of Leonard, and had many profound secrets together, most of which\nrelated to their wonders if Jemima and Mr Farquhar would ever be\nmarried. They watched their sister closely; and every day had some\nfresh confidence to make to each other, confirming or discouraging to\ntheir hopes.\n\nRuth rose early, and shared the household work with Sally and Miss\nBenson till seven; and then she helped Leonard to dress, and had a\nquiet time alone with him till prayers and breakfast. At nine she\nwas to be at Mr Bradshaw's house. She sat in the room with Mary and\nElizabeth during the Latin, the writing, and arithmetic lessons,\nwhich they received from masters; then she read, and walked with\nthem, they clinging to her as to an elder sister; she dined with her\npupils at the family lunch, and reached home by four. That happy\nhome--those quiet days!\n\nAnd so the peaceful days passed on into weeks, and months, and years,\nand Ruth and Leonard grew and strengthened into the riper beauty of\ntheir respective ages; while as yet no touch of decay had come on the\nquaint, primitive elders of the household.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nJemima Refuses to Be Managed\n\n\nIt was no wonder that the lookers-on were perplexed as to the state\nof affairs between Jemima and Mr Farquhar, for they too were sorely\npuzzled themselves at the sort of relationship between them. Was it\nlove, or was it not? that was the question in Mr Farquhar's mind. He\nhoped it was not; he believed it was not; and yet he felt as if it\nwere. There was something preposterous, he thought, in a man nearly\nforty years of age being in love with a girl of twenty. He had gone\non reasoning through all the days of his manhood on the idea of a\nstaid, noble-minded wife, grave and sedate, the fit companion in\nexperience of her husband. He had spoken with admiration of reticent\ncharacters, full of self-control and dignity; and he hoped--he\ntrusted, that all this time he had not been allowing himself\nunconsciously to fall in love with a wild-hearted, impetuous girl,\nwho knew nothing of life beyond her father's house, and who chafed\nunder the strict discipline enforced there. For it was rather a\nsuspicious symptom of the state of Mr Farquhar's affections, that\nhe had discovered the silent rebellion which continued in Jemima's\nheart, unperceived by any of her own family, against the severe laws\nand opinions of her father. Mr Farquhar shared in these opinions; but\nin him they were modified, and took a milder form. Still, he approved\nof much that Mr Bradshaw did and said; and this made it all the more\nstrange that he should wince so for Jemima, whenever anything took\nplace which he instinctively knew that she would dislike. After an\nevening at Mr Bradshaw's, when Jemima had gone to the very verge\nof questioning or disputing some of her father's severe judgments,\nMr Farquhar went home in a dissatisfied, restless state of mind,\nwhich he was almost afraid to analyse. He admired the inflexible\nintegrity--and almost the pomp of principle--evinced by Mr Bradshaw\non every occasion; he wondered how it was that Jemima could not see\nhow grand a life might be, whose every action was shaped in obedience\nto some eternal law; instead of which, he was afraid she rebelled\nagainst every law, and was only guided by impulse. Mr Farquhar had\nbeen taught to dread impulses as promptings of the devil. Sometimes,\nif he tried to present her father's opinions before her in another\nform, so as to bring himself and her rather more into that state\nof agreement he longed for, she flashed out upon him with the\nindignation of difference that she dared not show to, or before,\nher father, as if she had some diviner instinct which taught her\nmore truly than they knew, with all their experience; at least, in\nher first expressions there seemed something good and fine; but\nopposition made her angry and irritable, and the arguments which he\nwas constantly provoking (whenever he was with her in her father's\nabsence) frequently ended in some vehemence of expression on her part\nthat offended Mr Farquhar, who did not see how she expiated her anger\nin tears and self-reproaches when alone in her chamber. Then he would\nlecture himself severely on the interest he could not help feeling in\na wilful girl; he would determine not to interfere with her opinions\nin future, and yet, the very next time they differed, he strove to\nargue her into harmony with himself, in spite of all resolutions to\nthe contrary.\n\nMr Bradshaw saw just enough of this interest which Jemima had excited\nin his partner's mind, to determine him in considering their future\nmarriage as a settled affair. The fitness of the thing had long ago\nstruck him; her father's partner--so the fortune he meant to give\nher might continue in the business; a man of such steadiness of\ncharacter, and such a capital eye for a desirable speculation as\nMr Farquhar--just the right age to unite the paternal with the\nconjugal affection, and consequently the very man for Jemima, who\nhad something unruly in her, which might break out under a _r\u00c3\u00a9gime_\nless wisely adjusted to the circumstances than was Mr Bradshaw's (in\nhis own opinion)--a house ready-furnished, at a convenient distance\nfrom her home--no near relations on Mr Farquhar's side, who might be\ninclined to consider his residence as their own for an indefinite\ntime, and so add to the household expenses--in short, what could\nbe more suitable in every way? Mr Bradshaw respected the very\nself-restraint he thought he saw in Mr Farquhar's demeanour,\nattributing it to a wise desire to wait until trade should be rather\nmore slack, and the man of business more at leisure to become the\nlover.\n\nAs for Jemima, at times she thought she almost hated Mr Farquhar.\n\n\"What business has he,\" she would think, \"to lecture me? Often I can\nhardly bear it from papa, and I will not bear it from him. He treats\nme just like a child, and as if I should lose all my present opinions\nwhen I know more of the world. I am sure I should like never to know\nthe world, if it was to make me think as he does, hard man that he\nis! I wonder what made him take Jem Brown on as gardener again, if he\ndoes not believe that above one criminal in a thousand is restored to\ngoodness. I'll ask him, some day, if that was not acting on impulse\nrather than principle. Poor impulse! how you do get abused. But I\nwill tell Mr Farquhar I will not let him interfere with me. If I\ndo what papa bids me, no one has a right to notice whether I do it\nwillingly or not.\"\n\nSo then she tried to defy Mr Farquhar, by doing and saying things\nthat she knew he would disapprove. She went so far that he was\nseriously grieved, and did not even remonstrate and \"lecture,\" and\nthen she was disappointed and irritated; for, somehow, with all her\nindignation at interference, she liked to be lectured by him; not\nthat she was aware of this liking of hers, but still it would have\nbeen more pleasant to be scolded than so quietly passed over. Her two\nlittle sisters, with their wide-awake eyes, had long ago put things\ntogether, and conjectured. Every day they had some fresh mystery\ntogether, to be imparted in garden walks and whispered talks.\n\n\"Lizzie, did you see how the tears came into Mimie's eyes when Mr\nFarquhar looked so displeased when she said good people were always\ndull? I think she's in love.\" Mary said the last words with grave\nemphasis, and felt like an oracle of twelve years of age.\n\n\"I don't,\" said Lizzie. \"I know I cry often enough when papa is\ncross, and I'm not in love with him.\"\n\n\"Yes! but you don't look as Mimie did.\"\n\n\"Don't call her Mimie--you know papa does not like it.\"\n\n\"Yes; but there are so many things papa does not like I can never\nremember them all. Never mind about that; but listen to something\nI've got to tell you, if you'll never, never tell.\"\n\n\"No, indeed I won't, Mary. What is it?\"\n\n\"Not to Mrs Denbigh?\"\n\n\"No, not even to Mrs Denbigh.\"\n\n\"Well, then, the other day--last Friday, Mimie--\"\n\n\"Jemima!\" interrupted the more conscientious Elizabeth.\n\n\"Jemima, if it must be so,\" jerked out Mary, \"sent me to her desk for\nan envelope, and what do you think I saw?\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Elizabeth, expecting nothing less than a red-hot\nValentine, signed Walter Farquhar, _pro_ Bradshaw, Farquhar, and Co.,\nin full.\n\n\"Why, a piece of paper, with dull-looking lines upon it, just like\nthe scientific dialogues; and I remembered all about it. It was once\nwhen Mr Farquhar had been telling us that a bullet does not go in a\nstraight line, but in a something curve, and he drew some lines on a\npiece of paper; and Mimie--\"\n\n\"Jemima,\" put in Elizabeth.\n\n\"Well, well! she had treasured it up, and written in a corner, 'W.\nF., April 3rd.' Now, that's rather like love, is not it? For Jemima\nhates useful information just as much as I do, and that's saying a\ngreat deal; and yet she had kept this paper, and dated it.\"\n\n\"If that's all, I know Dick keeps a paper with Miss Benson's name\nwritten on it, and yet he's not in love with her; and perhaps Jemima\nmay like Mr Farquhar, and he may not like her. It seems such a little\nwhile since her hair was turned up, and he has always been a grave\nmiddle-aged man ever since I can recollect; and then, have you never\nnoticed how often he finds fault with her--almost lectures her?\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Mary; \"but he may be in love, for all that. Just\nthink how often papa lectures mamma; and yet, of course, they're in\nlove with each other.\"\n\n\"Well! we shall see,\" said Elizabeth.\n\nPoor Jemima little thought of the four sharp eyes that watched her\ndaily course while she sat alone, as she fancied, with her secret in\nher own room. For, in a passionate fit of grieving, at the impatient,\nhasty temper which had made her so seriously displease Mr Farquhar\nthat he had gone away without remonstrance, without more leave-taking\nthan a distant bow, she had begun to suspect that rather than not be\nnoticed at all by him, rather than be an object of indifference to\nhim--oh! far rather would she be an object of anger and upbraiding;\nand the thoughts that followed this confession to herself, stunned\nand bewildered her; and for once that they made her dizzy with hope,\nten times they made her sick with fear. For an instant she planned\nto become and to be all he could wish her; to change her very nature\nfor him. And then a great gush of pride came over her, and she set\nher teeth tight together, and determined that he should either love\nher as she was, or not at all. Unless he could take her with all\nher faults, she would not care for his regard; \"love\" was too noble\na word to call such cold, calculating feeling as his must be, who\nwent about with a pattern idea in his mind, trying to find a wife to\nmatch. Besides, there was something degrading, Jemima thought, in\ntrying to alter herself to gain the love of any human creature. And\nyet, if he did not care for her, if this late indifference were to\nlast, what a great shroud was drawn over life! Could she bear it?\n\nFrom the agony she dared not look at, but which she was going to risk\nencountering, she was aroused by the presence of her mother.\n\n\"Jemima! your father wants to speak to you in the dining-room.\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Oh! he is fidgeted by something Mr Farquhar said to me, and which\nI repeated. I am sure I thought there was no harm in it, and your\nfather always likes me to tell him what everybody says in his\nabsence.\"\n\nJemima went with a heavy heart into her father's presence.\n\nHe was walking up and down the room, and did not see her at first.\n\n\"Oh, Jemima! is that you? Has your mother told you what I want to\nspeak to you about?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Jemima. \"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"She has been telling me what proves to me how very seriously you\nmust have displeased and offended Mr Farquhar, before he could have\nexpressed himself to her as he did, when he left the house. You know\nwhat he said?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Jemima, her heart swelling within her. \"He has no right to\nsay anything about me.\" She was desperate, or she durst not have said\nthis before her father.\n\n\"No right!--what do you mean, Jemima?\" said Mr Bradshaw, turning\nsharp round. \"Surely you must know that I hope he may one day be\nyour husband; that is to say, if you prove yourself worthy of the\nexcellent training I have given you. I cannot suppose Mr Farquhar\nwould take any undisciplined girl as a wife.\"\n\nJemima held tight by a chair near which she was standing. She did not\nspeak; her father was pleased by her silence--it was the way in which\nhe liked his projects to be received.\n\n\"But you cannot suppose,\" he continued, \"that Mr Farquhar will\nconsent to marry you--\"\n\n\"Consent to marry me!\" repeated Jemima, in a low tone of brooding\nindignation; were those the terms upon which her rich woman's heart\nwas to be given, with a calm consent of acquiescent acceptance, but a\nlittle above resignation on the part of the receiver?\n\n--\"if you give way to a temper which, although you have never dared\nto show it to me, I am well aware exists, although I hoped the\nhabits of self-examination I had instilled had done much to cure\nyou of manifesting it. At one time, Richard promised to be the more\nheadstrong of the two; now, I must desire you to take pattern by him.\nYes,\" he continued, falling into his old train of thought, \"it would\nbe a most fortunate connexion for you in every way. I should have you\nunder my own eye, and could still assist you in the formation of your\ncharacter, and I should be at hand to strengthen and confirm your\nprinciples. Mr Farquhar's connexion with the firm would be convenient\nand agreeable to me in a pecuniary point of view. He--\" Mr Bradshaw\nwas going on in his enumeration of the advantages which he in\nparticular, and Jemima in the second place, would derive from this\nmarriage, when his daughter spoke, at first so low that he could not\nhear her, as he walked up and down the room with his creaking boots,\nand he had to stop to listen.\n\n\"Has Mr Farquhar ever spoken to you about it?\" Jemima's cheek was\nflushed as she asked the question; she wished that she might have\nbeen the person to whom he had first addressed himself.\n\nMr Bradshaw answered,\n\n\"No, not spoken. It has been implied between us for some time. At\nleast, I have been so aware of his intentions that I have made\nseveral allusions, in the course of business, to it, as a thing that\nmight take place. He can hardly have misunderstood; he must have seen\nthat I perceived his design, and approved of it,\" said Mr Bradshaw,\nrather doubtfully; as he remembered how very little, in fact, passed\nbetween him and his partner which could have reference to the\nsubject, to any but a mind prepared to receive it. Perhaps Mr\nFarquhar had not really thought of it; but then again, that would\nimply that his own penetration had been mistaken, a thing not\nimpossible certainly, but quite beyond the range of probability. So\nhe reassured himself, and (as he thought) his daughter, by saying,\n\n\"The whole thing is so suitable--the advantages arising from the\nconnexion are so obvious; besides which, I am quite aware, from many\nlittle speeches of Mr Farquhar's, that he contemplates marriage at\nno very distant time; and he seldom leaves Eccleston, and visits\nfew families besides our own--certainly, none that can compare with\nours in the advantages you have all received in moral and religious\ntraining.\" But then Mr Bradshaw was checked in his implied praises of\nhimself (and only himself could be his martingale when he once set\nout on such a career) by a recollection that Jemima must not feel too\nsecure, as she might become if he dwelt too much on the advantages of\nher being her father's daughter. Accordingly, he said: \"But you must\nbe aware, Jemima, that you do very little credit to the education I\nhave given you, when you make such an impression as you must have\ndone to-day, before Mr Farquhar could have said what he did of you!\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked Jemima, still in the low, husky tone of\nsuppressed anger.\n\n\"Your mother says he remarked to her, 'What a pity it is, that Jemima\ncannot maintain her opinions without going into a passion; and what\na pity it is, that her opinions are such as to sanction, rather than\ncurb, these fits of rudeness and anger!'\"\n\n\"Did he say that?\" said Jemima, in a still lower tone, not\nquestioning her father, but speaking rather to herself.\n\n\"I have no doubt he did,\" replied her father, gravely. \"Your mother\nis in the habit of repeating accurately to me what takes place in my\nabsence; besides which, the whole speech is not one of hers; she has\nnot altered a word in the repetition, I am convinced. I have trained\nher to habits of accuracy very unusual in a woman.\"\n\nAt another time, Jemima might have been inclined to rebel against\nthis system of carrying constant intelligence to headquarters,\nwhich she had long ago felt as an insurmountable obstacle to any\nfree communication with her mother; but now, her father's means of\nacquiring knowledge faded into insignificance before the nature of\nthe information he imparted. She stood quite still, grasping the\nchair-back, longing to be dismissed.\n\n\"I have said enough now, I hope, to make you behave in a becoming\nmanner to Mr Farquhar; if your temper is too unruly to be always\nunder your own control, at least have respect to my injunctions, and\ntake some pains to curb it before him.\"\n\n\"May I go?\" asked Jemima, chafing more and more.\n\n\"You may,\" said her father. When she left the room he gently rubbed\nhis hands together, satisfied with the effect he had produced, and\nwondering how it was, that one so well brought up as his daughter\ncould ever say or do anything to provoke such a remark from Mr\nFarquhar as that which he had heard repeated.\n\n\"Nothing can be more gentle and docile than she is when spoken to in\nthe proper manner. I must give Farquhar a hint,\" said Mr Bradshaw to\nhimself.\n\nJemima rushed upstairs, and locked herself into her room. She began\npacing up and down at first, without shedding a tear; but then she\nsuddenly stopped, and burst out crying with passionate indignation.\n\n\"So! I am to behave well, not because it is right--not because it is\nright--but to show off before Mr Farquhar. Oh, Mr Farquhar!\" said\nshe, suddenly changing to a sort of upbraiding tone of voice, \"I did\nnot think so of you an hour ago. I did not think you could choose a\nwife in that cold-hearted way, though you did profess to act by rule\nand line; but you think to have me, do you? because it is fitting\nand suitable, and you want to be married, and can't spare time for\nwooing\" (she was lashing herself up by an exaggeration of all her\nfather had said). \"And how often I have thought you were too grand\nfor me! but now I know better. Now I can believe that all you do is\ndone from calculation; you are good because it adds to your business\ncredit--you talk in that high strain about principle because it\nsounds well, and is respectable--and even these things are better\nthan your cold way of looking out for a wife, just as you would do\nfor a carpet, to add to your comforts, and settle you respectably.\nBut I won't be that wife. You shall see something of me which shall\nmake you not acquiesce so quietly in the arrangements of the firm.\"\nShe cried too vehemently to go on thinking or speaking. Then she\nstopped, and said:\n\n\"Only an hour ago I was hoping--I don't know what I was hoping--but\nI thought--oh! how I was deceived!--I thought he had a true, deep,\nloving, manly heart, which God might let me win; but now I know he\nhas only a calm, calculating head--\"\n\nIf Jemima had been vehement and passionate before this conversation\nwith her father, it was better than the sullen reserve she assumed\nnow whenever Mr Farquhar came to the house. He felt it deeply; no\nreasoning with himself took off the pain he experienced. He tried to\nspeak on the subjects she liked, in the manner she liked, until he\ndespised himself for the unsuccessful efforts.\n\nHe stood between her and her father once or twice, in obvious\ninconsistency with his own previously expressed opinions; and Mr\nBradshaw piqued himself upon his admirable management, in making\nJemima feel that she owed his indulgence or forbearance to\nMr Farquhar's interference; but Jemima--perverse, miserable\nJemima--thought that she hated Mr Farquhar all the more. She\nrespected her father inflexible, much more than her father pompously\ngiving up to Mr Farquhar's subdued remonstrances on her behalf.\nEven Mr Bradshaw was perplexed, and shut himself up to consider how\nJemima was to be made more fully to understand his wishes and her own\ninterests. But there was nothing to take hold of as a ground for any\nfurther conversation with her. Her actions were so submissive that\nthey were spiritless; she did all her father desired; she did it\nwith a nervous quickness and haste, if she thought that otherwise\nMr Farquhar would interfere in any way. She wished evidently to\nowe nothing to him. She had begun by leaving the room when he came\nin, after the conversation she had had with her father; but at Mr\nBradshaw's first expression of his wish that she should remain, she\nremained--silent, indifferent, inattentive to all that was going on;\nat least there was this appearance of inattention. She would work\naway at her sewing as if she were to earn her livelihood by it; the\nlight was gone out of her eyes as she lifted them up heavily before\nreplying to any question, and the eyelids were often swollen with\ncrying.\n\nBut in all this there was no positive fault. Mr Bradshaw could not\nhave told her not to do this, or to do that, without her doing it;\nfor she had become much more docile of late.\n\nIt was a wonderful proof of the influence Ruth had gained in the\nfamily, that Mr Bradshaw, after much deliberation, congratulated\nhimself on the wise determination he had made of requesting her to\nspeak to Jemima, and find out what feeling was at the bottom of all\nthis change in her ways of going on.\n\nHe rang the bell.\n\n\"Is Mrs Denbigh here?\" he inquired of the servant who answered it.\n\n\"Yes, sir; she is just come.\"\n\n\"Beg her to come to me in this room as soon as she can leave the\nyoung ladies.\"\n\nRuth came.\n\n\"Sit down, Mrs Denbigh; sit down. I want to have a little\nconversation with you; not about your pupils, they are going on well\nunder your care, I am sure; and I often congratulate myself on the\nchoice I made--I assure you I do. But now I want to speak to you\nabout Jemima. She is very fond of you, and perhaps you could take\nsome opportunity of observing to her--in short, of saying to her,\nthat she is behaving very foolishly--in fact, disgusting Mr Farquhar\n(who was, I know, inclined to like her) by the sullen, sulky way she\nbehaves in, when he is by.\"\n\nHe paused for the ready acquiescence he expected. But Ruth did not\nquite comprehend what was required of her, and disliked the glimpse\nshe had gained of the task very much.\n\n\"I hardly understand, sir. You are displeased with Miss Bradshaw's\nmanners to Mr Farquhar.\"\n\n\"Well, well! not quite that; I am displeased with her manners--they\nare sulky and abrupt, particularly when he is by--and I want you (of\nwhom she is so fond) to speak to her about it.\"\n\n\"But I have never had the opportunity of noticing them. Whenever I\nhave seen her, she has been most gentle and affectionate.\"\n\n\"But I think you do not hesitate to believe me, when I say that I\nhave noticed the reverse,\" said Mr Bradshaw, drawing himself up.\n\n\"No, sir. I beg your pardon if I have expressed myself so badly as to\nseem to doubt. But am I to tell Miss Bradshaw that you have spoken\nof her faults to me?\" asked Ruth, a little astonished, and shrinking\nmore than ever from the proposed task.\n\n\"If you would allow me to finish what I have got to say, without\ninterruption, I could then tell you what I do wish.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" said Ruth, gently.\n\n\"I wish you to join our circle occasionally in an evening; Mrs\nBradshaw shall send you an invitation when Mr Farquhar is likely\nto be here. Warned by me, and, consequently, with your observation\nquickened, you can hardly fail to notice instances of what I have\npointed out; and then I will trust to your own good sense\" (Mr\nBradshaw bowed to her at this part of his sentence) \"to find an\nopportunity to remonstrate with her.\"\n\nRuth was beginning to speak, but he waved his hand for another minute\nof silence.\n\n\"Only a minute, Mrs Denbigh. I am quite aware that, in requesting\nyour presence occasionally in the evening, I shall be trespassing\nupon the time which is, in fact, your money; you may be assured that\nI shall not forget this little circumstance, and you can explain what\nI have said on this head to Benson and his sister.\"\n\n\"I am afraid I cannot do it,\" Ruth began; but while she was choosing\nwords delicate enough to express her reluctance to act as he wished,\nhe had almost bowed her out of the room; and thinking that she was\nmodest in her estimate of her qualifications for remonstrating with\nhis daughter, he added, blandly,\n\n\"No one so able, Mrs Denbigh. I have observed many qualities in\nyou--observed when, perhaps, you have little thought it.\"\n\nIf he had observed Ruth that morning, he would have seen an absence\nof mind, and depression of spirits, not much to her credit as a\nteacher; for she could not bring herself to feel that she had any\nright to go into the family purposely to watch over and find fault\nwith any one member of it. If she had seen anything wrong in Jemima,\nRuth loved her so much that she would have told her of it in private;\nand with many doubts, how far she was the one to pull out the mote\nfrom any one's eye, even in the most tender manner;--she would have\nhad to conquer reluctance before she could have done even this;\nbut there was something undefinably repugnant to her in the manner\nof acting which Mr Bradshaw had proposed, and she determined not\nto accept the invitations which were to place her in so false a\nposition.\n\nBut as she was leaving the house, after the end of the lessons, while\nshe stood in the hall tying on her bonnet, and listening to the last\nsmall confidences of her two pupils, she saw Jemima coming in through\nthe garden-door, and was struck by the change in her looks. The large\neyes, so brilliant once, were dim and clouded; the complexion sallow\nand colourless; a lowering expression was on the dark brow, and the\ncorners of her mouth drooped as with sorrowful thoughts. She looked\nup, and her eyes met Ruth's.\n\n\"Oh! you beautiful creature!\" thought Jemima, \"with your still, calm,\nheavenly face, what are you to know of earth's trials! You have lost\nyour beloved by death--but that is a blessed sorrow; the sorrow I\nhave pulls me down and down, and makes me despise and hate every\none--not you, though.\" And, her face changing to a soft, tender look,\nshe went up to Ruth, and kissed her fondly; as if it were a relief to\nbe near some one on whose true, pure heart she relied. Ruth returned\nthe caress; and even while she did so, she suddenly rescinded her\nresolution to keep clear of what Mr Bradshaw had desired her to do.\nOn her way home she resolved, if she could, to find out what were\nJemima's secret feelings; and if (as, from some previous knowledge,\nshe suspected) they were morbid and exaggerated in any way, to try\nand help her right with all the wisdom which true love gives. It\nwas time that some one should come to still the storm in Jemima's\nturbulent heart, which was daily and hourly knowing less and less of\npeace. The irritating difficulty was to separate the two characters,\nwhich at two different times she had attributed to Mr Farquhar--the\nold one, which she had formerly believed to be true, that he was a\nman acting up to a high standard of lofty principle, and acting up\nwithout a struggle (and this last had been the circumstance which\nhad made her rebellious and irritable once); the new one, which\nher father had excited in her suspicious mind, that Mr Farquhar\nwas cold and calculating in all he did, and that she was to be\ntransferred by the former, and accepted by the latter, as a sort of\nstock-in-trade--these were the two Mr Farquhars who clashed together\nin her mind. And in this state of irritation and prejudice, she could\nnot bear the way in which he gave up his opinions to please her;\nthat was not the way to win her; she liked him far better when he\ninflexibly and rigidly adhered to his idea of right and wrong, not\neven allowing any force to temptation, and hardly any grace to\nrepentance, compared with that beauty of holiness which had never\nyielded to sin. He had been her idol in those days, as she found out\nnow, however much at the time she had opposed him with violence.\n\nAs for Mr Farquhar, he was almost weary of himself; no reasoning,\neven no principle, seemed to have influence over him, for he saw\nthat Jemima was not at all what he approved of in woman. He saw her\nuncurbed and passionate, affecting to despise the rules of life he\nheld most sacred, and indifferent to, if not positively disliking\nhim; and yet he loved her dearly. But he resolved to make a great\neffort of will, and break loose from these trammels of sense. And\nwhile he resolved, some old recollection would bring her up, hanging\non his arm, in all the confidence of early girlhood, looking up in\nhis face with her soft, dark eyes, and questioning him upon the\nmysterious subjects which had so much interest for both of them at\nthat time, although they had become only matter for dissension in\nthese later days.\n\nIt was also true, as Mr Bradshaw had said, Mr Farquhar wished to\nmarry, and had not much choice in the small town of Eccleston. He\nnever put this so plainly before himself, as a reason for choosing\nJemima, as her father had done to her; but it was an unconscious\nmotive all the same. However, now he had lectured himself into the\nresolution to make a pretty long absence from Eccleston, and see if,\namongst his distant friends, there was no woman more in accordance\nwith his ideal, who could put the naughty, wilful, plaguing Jemima\nBradshaw out of his head, if he did not soon perceive some change in\nher for the better.\n\nA few days after Ruth's conversation with Mr Bradshaw, the invitation\nshe had been expecting, yet dreading, came. It was to her alone. Mr\nand Miss Benson were pleased at the compliment to her, and urged her\nacceptance of it. She wished that they had been included; she had not\nthought it right, or kind to Jemima, to tell them why she was going,\nand she feared now lest they should feel a little hurt that they were\nnot asked too. But she need not have been afraid. They were glad and\nproud of the attention to her, and never thought of themselves.\n\n\"Ruthie, what gown shall you wear to-night? your dark grey one, I\nsuppose?\" asked Miss Benson.\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so. I never thought of it; but that is my best.\"\n\n\"Well; then, I shall quill up a ruff for you. You know I am a famous\nquiller of net.\"\n\nRuth came downstairs with a little flush on her cheeks when she was\nready to go. She held her bonnet and shawl in her hand, for she knew\nMiss Benson and Sally would want to see her dressed.\n\n\"Is not mamma pretty?\" asked Leonard, with a child's pride.\n\n\"She looks very nice and tidy,\" said Miss Benson, who had an idea\nthat children should not talk or think about beauty.\n\n\"I think my ruff looks so nice,\" said Ruth, with gentle pleasure. And\nindeed it did look nice, and set off the pretty round throat most\nbecomingly. Her hair, now grown long and thick, was smoothed as close\nto her head as its waving nature would allow, and plaited up in a\ngreat rich knot low down behind. The grey gown was as plain as plain\ncould be.\n\n\"You should have light gloves, Ruth,\" said Miss Benson. She went\nupstairs, and brought down a delicate pair of Limerick ones, which\nhad been long treasured up in a walnut-shell.\n\n\"They say them gloves is made of chickens'-skins,\" said Sally,\nexamining them curiously. \"I wonder how they set about skinning 'em.\"\n\n\"Here, Ruth,\" said Mr Benson, coming in from the garden, \"here's a\nrose or two for you. I am sorry there are no more; I hoped I should\nhave had my yellow rose out by this time, but the damask and the\nwhite are in a warmer corner, and have got the start.\"\n\nMiss Benson and Leonard stood at the door, and watched her down the\nlittle passage-street till she was out of sight.\n\nShe had hardly touched the bell at Mr Bradshaw's door, when Mary and\nElizabeth opened it with boisterous glee.\n\n\"We saw you coming--we've been watching for you--we want you to come\nround the garden before tea; papa is not come in yet. Do come!\"\n\nShe went round the garden with a little girl clinging to each arm. It\nwas full of sunshine and flowers, and this made the contrast between\nit and the usual large family room (which fronted the north-east, and\ntherefore had no evening sun to light up its cold, drab furniture)\nmore striking than usual. It looked very gloomy. There was the great\ndining-table, heavy and square; the range of chairs, straight and\nsquare; the work-boxes, useful and square; the colouring of walls,\nand carpet, and curtains, all of the coldest description; everything\nwas handsome, and everything was ugly. Mrs Bradshaw was asleep in her\neasy-chair when they came in. Jemima had just put down her work, and,\nlost in thought, she leant her cheek on her hand. When she saw Ruth\nshe brightened a little, and went to her and kissed her. Mrs Bradshaw\njumped up at the sound of their entrance, and was wide awake in a\nmoment.\n\n\"Oh! I thought your father was here,\" said she, evidently relieved to\nfind that he had not come in and caught her sleeping.\n\n\"Thank you, Mrs Denbigh, for coming to us to-night,\" said she, in\nthe quiet tone in which she generally spoke in her husband's absence.\nWhen he was there, a sort of constant terror of displeasing him made\nher voice sharp and nervous; the children knew that many a thing\npassed over by their mother when their father was away, was sure\nto be noticed by her when he was present; and noticed, too, in a\ncross and querulous manner, for she was so much afraid of the blame\nwhich on any occasion of their misbehaviour fell upon her. And yet\nshe looked up to her husband with a reverence and regard, and a\nfaithfulness of love, which his decision of character was likely to\nproduce on a weak and anxious mind. He was a rest and a support to\nher, on whom she cast all her responsibilities; she was an obedient,\nunremonstrating wife to him; no stronger affection had ever brought\nher duty to him into conflict with any desire of her heart. She loved\nher children dearly, though they all perplexed her very frequently.\nHer son was her especial darling, because he very seldom brought her\ninto any scrapes with his father; he was so cautious and prudent,\nand had the art of \"keeping a calm sough\" about any difficulty he\nmight be in. With all her dutiful sense of the obligation, which her\nhusband enforced upon her, to notice and tell him everything that was\ngoing wrong in the household, and especially among his children, Mrs\nBradshaw, somehow, contrived to be honestly blind to a good deal that\nwas not praiseworthy in Master Richard.\n\nMr Bradshaw came in before long, bringing with him Mr Farquhar.\nJemima had been talking to Ruth with some interest before then; but,\non seeing Mr Farquhar, she bent her head down over her work, went a\nlittle paler, and turned obstinately silent. Mr Bradshaw longed to\ncommand her to speak; but even he had a suspicion that what she might\nsay, when so commanded, might be rather worse in its effect than\nher gloomy silence; so he held his peace, and a discontented, angry\nkind of peace it was. Mrs Bradshaw saw that something was wrong, but\ncould not tell what; only she became every moment more trembling, and\nnervous, and irritable, and sent Mary and Elizabeth off on all sorts\nof contradictory errands to the servants, and made the tea twice\nas strong, and sweetened it twice as much as usual, in hopes of\npacifying her husband with good things.\n\nMr Farquhar had gone for the last time, or so he thought. He had\nresolved (for the fifth time) that he would go and watch Jemima once\nmore, and if her temper got the better of her, and she showed the old\nsullenness again, and gave the old proofs of indifference to his good\nopinion, he would give her up altogether, and seek a wife elsewhere.\nHe sat watching her with folded arms, and in silence. Altogether they\nwere a pleasant family party!\n\nJemima wanted to wind a skein of wool. Mr Farquhar saw it, and came\nto her, anxious to do her this little service. She turned away\npettishly, and asked Ruth to hold it for her.\n\nRuth was hurt for Mr Farquhar, and looked sorrowfully at Jemima; but\nJemima would not see her glance of upbraiding, as Ruth, hoping that\nshe would relent, delayed a little to comply with her request. Mr\nFarquhar did; and went back to his seat to watch them both. He saw\nJemima turbulent and stormy in look; he saw Ruth, to all appearance\nheavenly calm as the angels, or with only that little tinge of sorrow\nwhich her friend's behaviour had called forth. He saw the unusual\nbeauty of her face and form, which he had never noticed before; and\nhe saw Jemima, with all the brilliancy she once possessed in eyes and\ncomplexion, dimmed and faded. He watched Ruth, speaking low and soft\nto the little girls, who seemed to come to her in every difficulty;\nand he remarked her gentle firmness when their bedtime came, and\nthey pleaded to stay up longer (their father was absent in his\ncounting-house, or they would not have dared to do so). He liked\nRuth's soft, distinct, unwavering \"No! you must go. You must keep to\nwhat is right,\" far better than the good-natured yielding to entreaty\nhe had formerly admired in Jemima. He was wandering off into this\ncomparison, while Ruth, with delicate and unconscious tact, was\ntrying to lead Jemima into some subject which should take her away\nfrom the thoughts, whatever they were, that made her so ungracious\nand rude.\n\nJemima was ashamed of herself before Ruth, in a way which she had\nnever been before any one else. She valued Ruth's good opinion so\nhighly, that she dreaded lest her friend should perceive her faults.\nShe put a check upon herself--a check at first; but after a little\ntime she had forgotten something of her trouble, and listened to\nRuth, and questioned her about Leonard, and smiled at his little\nwitticisms; and only the sighs, that would come up from the very\nforce of habit, brought back the consciousness of her unhappiness.\nBefore the end of the evening, Jemima had allowed herself to speak to\nMr Farquhar in the old way--questioning, differing, disputing. She\nwas recalled to the remembrance of that miserable conversation by the\nentrance of her father. After that she was silent. But he had seen\nher face more animated, and bright with a smile, as she spoke to Mr\nFarquhar; and although he regretted the loss of her complexion (for\nshe was still very pale), he was highly pleased with the success of\nhis project. He never doubted but that Ruth had given her some sort\nof private exhortation to behave better. He could not have understood\nthe pretty art with which, by simply banishing unpleasant subjects,\nand throwing a wholesome natural sunlit tone over others, Ruth had\ninsensibly drawn Jemima out of her gloom. He resolved to buy Mrs\nDenbigh a handsome silk gown the very next day. He did not believe\nshe had a silk gown, poor creature! He had noticed that dark grey\nstuff, this long, long time, as her Sunday dress. He liked the\ncolour; the silk one should be just the same tinge. Then he thought\nthat it would, perhaps, be better to choose a lighter shade, one\nwhich might be noticed as different to the old gown. For he had no\ndoubt she would like to have it remarked, and, perhaps, would not\nobject to tell people, that it was a present from Mr Bradshaw--a\ntoken of his approbation. He smiled a little to himself as he thought\nof this additional source of pleasure to Ruth. She, in the meantime,\nwas getting up to go home. While Jemima was lighting the bed-candle\nat the lamp, Ruth came round to bid good night. Mr Bradshaw could\nnot allow her to remain till the morrow, uncertain whether he was\nsatisfied or not.\n\n\"Good night, Mrs Denbigh,\" said he. \"Good night. Thank you. I am\nobliged to you--I am exceedingly obliged to you.\"\n\nHe laid emphasis on these words, for he was pleased to see Mr\nFarquhar step forward to help Jemima in her little office.\n\nMr Farquhar offered to accompany Ruth home; but the streets that\nintervened between Mr Bradshaw's and the Chapel-house were so quiet\nthat he desisted, when he learnt from Ruth's manner how much she\ndisliked his proposal. Mr Bradshaw, too, instantly observed:\n\n\"Oh! Mrs Denbigh need not trouble you, Farquhar. I have servants at\nliberty at any moment to attend on her, if she wishes it.\"\n\nIn fact, he wanted to make hay while the sun shone, and to detain Mr\nFarquhar a little longer, now that Jemima was so gracious. She went\nupstairs with Ruth to help her to put on her things.\n\n\"Dear Jemima!\" said Ruth, \"I am so glad to see you looking better\nto-night! You quite frightened me this morning, you looked so ill.\"\n\n\"Did I?\" replied Jemima. \"Oh, Ruth! I have been so unhappy lately. I\nwant you to come and put me to rights,\" she continued, half smiling.\n\"You know I'm a sort of out-pupil of yours, though we are so nearly\nof an age. You ought to lecture me, and make me good.\"\n\n\"Should I, dear?\" said Ruth. \"I don't think I'm the one to do it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! you are--you've done me good to-night.\"\n\n\"Well, if I can do anything for you, tell me what it is?\" asked Ruth,\ntenderly.\n\n\"Oh, not now--not now,\" replied Jemima. \"I could not tell you here.\nIt's a long story, and I don't know that I can tell you at all. Mamma\nmight come up at any moment, and papa would be sure to ask what we\nhad been talking about so long.\"\n\n\"Take your own time, love,\" said Ruth; \"only remember, as far as I\ncan, how glad I am to help you.\"\n\n\"You're too good, my darling!\" said Jemima, fondly.\n\n\"Don't say so,\" replied Ruth, earnestly, almost as if she were\nafraid. \"God knows I am not.\"\n\n\"Well! we're none of us too good,\" answered Jemima; \"I know that. But\nyou _are_ very good. Nay, I won't call you so, if it makes you look\nso miserable. But come away downstairs.\"\n\nWith the fragrance of Ruth's sweetness lingering about her, Jemima\nwas her best self during the next half-hour. Mr Bradshaw was more and\nmore pleased, and raised the price of the silk, which he was going\nto give Ruth, sixpence a yard during the time. Mr Farquhar went home\nthrough the garden-way, happier than he had been this long time. He\neven caught himself humming the old refrain:\n\n\n   On revient, on revient toujours,\n   A ses premiers amours.\n\n\nBut as soon as he was aware of what he was doing, he cleared away the\nremnants of the song into a cough, which was sonorous, if not\nperfectly real.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nMr Farquhar's Attentions Transferred\n\n\nThe next morning, as Jemima and her mother sat at their work, it came\ninto the head of the former to remember her father's very marked way\nof thanking Ruth the evening before.\n\n\"What a favourite Mrs Denbigh is with papa,\" said she. \"I am sure I\ndon't wonder at it. Did you notice, mamma, how he thanked her for\ncoming here last night?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear; but I don't think it was all--\" Mrs Bradshaw stopped\nshort. She was never certain if it was right or wrong to say\nanything.\n\n\"Not all what?\" asked Jemima, when she saw her mother was not going\nto finish the sentence.\n\n\"Not all because Mrs Denbigh came to tea here,\" replied Mrs Bradshaw.\n\n\"Why, what else could he be thanking her for? What has she done?\"\nasked Jemima, stimulated to curiosity by her mother's hesitating\nmanner.\n\n\"I don't know if I ought to tell you,\" said Mrs Bradshaw.\n\n\"Oh, very well!\" said Jemima, rather annoyed.\n\n\"Nay, dear! your papa never said I was not to tell; perhaps I may.\"\n\n\"Never mind! I don't want to hear,\" in a piqued tone.\n\nThere was silence for a little while. Jemima was trying to think of\nsomething else, but her thoughts would revert to the wonder what Mrs\nDenbigh could have done for her father.\n\n\"I think I may tell you, though,\" said Mrs Bradshaw, half\nquestioning.\n\nJemima had the honour not to urge any confidence, but she was too\ncurious to take any active step towards repressing it.\n\nMrs Bradshaw went on. \"I think you deserve to know. It is partly your\ndoing that papa is so pleased with Mrs Denbigh. He is going to buy\nher a silk gown this morning, and I think you ought to know why.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Jemima.\n\n\"Because papa is so pleased to find that you mind what she says.\"\n\n\"I mind what she says! To be sure I do, and always did. But why\nshould papa give her a gown for that? I think he ought to give it me\nrather,\" said Jemima, half laughing.\n\n\"I am sure he would, dear; he will give you one, I am certain, if\nyou want one. He was so pleased to see you like your old self to Mr\nFarquhar last night. We neither of us could think what had come over\nyou this last month; but now all seems right.\"\n\nA dark cloud came over Jemima's face. She did not like this close\nobservation and constant comment upon her manners; and what had Ruth\nto do with it?\n\n\"I am glad you were pleased,\" said she, very coldly. Then, after a\npause, she added, \"But you have not told me what Mrs Denbigh had to\ndo with my good behaviour.\"\n\n\"Did not she speak to you about it?\" asked Mrs Bradshaw, looking up.\n\n\"No; why should she? She has no right to criticise what I do. She\nwould not be so impertinent,\" said Jemima, feeling very uncomfortable\nand suspicious.\n\n\"Yes, love! she would have had a right, for papa had desired her to\ndo it.\"\n\n\"Papa desired her! What do you mean, mamma?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! I dare say I should not have told you,\" said Mrs Bradshaw,\nperceiving, from Jemima's tone of voice, that something had gone\nwrong. \"Only you spoke as if it would be impertinent in Mrs Denbigh,\nand I am sure she would not do anything that was impertinent. You\nknow, it would be but right for her to do what papa told her; and he\nsaid a great deal to her, the other day, about finding out why you\nwere so cross, and bringing you right. And you are right now, dear!\"\nsaid Mrs Bradshaw, soothingly, thinking that Jemima was annoyed (like\na good child) at the recollection of how naughty she had been.\n\n\"Then papa is going to give Mrs Denbigh a gown because I was civil to\nMr Farquhar last night?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear!\" said Mrs Bradshaw, more and more frightened at Jemima's\nangry manner of speaking--low-toned, but very indignant.\n\nJemima remembered, with smouldered anger, Ruth's pleading way\nof wiling her from her sullenness the night before. Management\neverywhere! but in this case it was peculiarly revolting; so much so,\nthat she could hardly bear to believe that the seemingly-transparent\nRuth had lent herself to it.\n\n\"Are you sure, mamma, that papa asked Mrs Denbigh to make me behave\ndifferently? It seems so strange.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure. He spoke to her last Friday morning in the study. I\nremember it was Friday, because Mrs Dean was working here.\"\n\nJemima remembered now that she had gone into the school-room on the\nFriday, and found her sisters lounging about, and wondering what papa\ncould possibly want with Mrs Denbigh.\n\nAfter this conversation, Jemima repulsed all Ruth's timid efforts to\nascertain the cause of her disturbance, and to help her if she could.\nRuth's tender, sympathising manner, as she saw Jemima daily looking\nmore wretched, was distasteful to the latter in the highest degree.\nShe could not say that Mrs Denbigh's conduct was positively wrong--it\nmight even be quite right; but it was inexpressibly repugnant to her\nto think of her father consulting with a stranger (a week ago she\nalmost considered Ruth as a sister) how to manage his daughter, so as\nto obtain the end he wished for; yes, even if that end was for her\nown good.\n\nShe was thankful and glad to see a brown paper parcel lying on the\nhall-table, with a note in Ruth's handwriting, addressed to her\nfather. She _knew_ what it was, the grey silk dress. That she was\nsure Ruth would never accept.\n\nNo one henceforward could induce Jemima to enter into conversation\nwith Mr Farquhar. She suspected manoeuvring in the simplest\nactions, and was miserable in this constant state of suspicion. She\nwould not allow herself to like Mr Farquhar, even when he said things\nthe most after her own heart. She heard him, one evening, talking\nwith her father about the principles of trade. Her father stood out\nfor the keenest, sharpest work, consistent with honesty; if he had\nnot been her father she would, perhaps, have thought some of his\nsayings inconsistent with true Christian honesty. He was for driving\nhard bargains, exacting interest and payment of just bills to a day.\nThat was (he said) the only way in which trade could be conducted.\nOnce allow a margin of uncertainty, or where feelings, instead of\nmaxims, were to be the guide, and all hope of there ever being any\ngood men of business was ended.\n\n\"Suppose a delay of a month in requiring payment might save a man's\ncredit--prevent his becoming a bankrupt?\" put in Mr Farquhar.\n\n\"I would not give it him. I would let him have money to set up again\nas soon as he had passed the Bankruptcy Court; if he never passed, I\nmight, in some cases, make him an allowance; but I would always keep\nmy justice and my charity separate.\"\n\n\"And yet charity (in your sense of the word) degrades; justice,\ntempered with mercy and consideration, elevates.\"\n\n\"That is not justice--justice is certain and inflexible. No! Mr\nFarquhar, you must not allow any Quixotic notions to mingle with your\nconduct as a tradesman.\"\n\nAnd so they went on; Jemima's face glowing with sympathy in all Mr\nFarquhar said; till once, on looking up suddenly with sparkling eyes,\nshe saw a glance of her father's which told her, as plain as words\ncould say, that he was watching the effect of Mr Farquhar's speeches\nupon his daughter. She was chilled thenceforward; she thought her\nfather prolonged the argument, in order to call out those sentiments\nwhich he knew would most recommend his partner to his daughter. She\nwould so fain have let herself love Mr Farquhar; but this constant\nmanoeuvring, in which she did not feel clear that he did not take a\npassive part, made her sick at heart. She even wished that they might\nnot go through the form of pretending to try to gain her consent\nto the marriage, if it involved all this premeditated action and\nspeech-making--such moving about of every one into their right\nplaces, like pieces at chess. She felt as if she would rather be\nbought openly, like an Oriental daughter, where no one is degraded in\ntheir own eyes by being parties to such a contract. The consequences\nof all this \"admirable management\" of Mr Bradshaw's would have been\nvery unfortunate to Mr Farquhar (who was innocent of all connivance\nin any of the plots--indeed, would have been as much annoyed at them\nas Jemima, had he been aware of them), but that the impression made\nupon him by Ruth on the evening I have so lately described, was\ndeepened by the contrast which her behaviour made to Miss Bradshaw's\non one or two more recent occasions.\n\nThere was no use, he thought, in continuing attentions so evidently\ndistasteful to Jemima. To her, a young girl hardly out of the\nschoolroom, he probably appeared like an old man; and he might even\nlose the friendship with which she used to regard him, and which was,\nand ever would be, very dear to him, if he persevered in trying to be\nconsidered as a lover. He should always feel affectionately towards\nher; her very faults gave her an interest in his eyes, for which\nhe had blamed himself most conscientiously and most uselessly when\nhe was looking upon her as his future wife, but which the said\nconscience would learn to approve of when she sank down to the place\nof a young friend, over whom he might exercise a good and salutary\ninterest. Mrs Denbigh, if not many months older in years, had known\nsorrow and cares so early that she was much older in character.\nBesides, her shy reserve, and her quiet daily walk within the lines\nof duty, were much in accordance with Mr Farquhar's notion of what a\nwife should be. Still, it was a wrench to take his affections away\nfrom Jemima. If she had not helped him to do so by every means in her\npower, he could never have accomplished it.\n\nYes! by every means in her power had Jemima alienated her lover, her\nbeloved--for so he was in fact. And now her quick-sighted eyes saw he\nwas gone for ever--past recall; for did not her jealous, sore heart\nfeel, even before he himself was conscious of the fact, that he was\ndrawn towards sweet, lovely, composed, and dignified Ruth--one who\nalways thought before she spoke (as Mr Farquhar used to bid Jemima\ndo)--who never was tempted by sudden impulse, but walked the world\ncalm and self-governed. What now availed Jemima's reproaches, as she\nremembered the days when he had watched her with earnest, attentive\neyes, as he now watched Ruth; and the times since, when, led astray\nby her morbid fancy, she had turned away from all his advances!\n\n\"It was only in March--last March, he called me 'dear Jemima.' Ah,\ndon't I remember it well? The pretty nosegay of green-house flowers\nthat he gave me in exchange for the wild daffodils--and how he seemed\nto care for the flowers I gave him--and how he looked at me, and\nthanked me--that is all gone and over now.\"\n\nHer sisters came in bright and glowing.\n\n\"Oh, Jemima, how nice and cool you are, sitting in this shady room!\"\n(She had felt it even chilly.) \"We have been such a long walk! We are\nso tired. It is so hot.\"\n\n\"Why did you go, then?\" said she.\n\n\"Oh! we wanted to go. We would not have stayed at home on any\naccount. It has been so pleasant,\" said Mary.\n\n\"We've been to Scaurside Wood, to gather wild strawberries,\" said\nElizabeth. \"Such a quantity! We've left a whole basketful in the\ndairy. Mr Farquhar says he'll teach us how to dress them in the way\nhe learnt in Germany, if we can get him some hock. Do you think papa\nwill let us have some?\"\n\n\"Was Mr Farquhar with you?\" asked Jemima, a dull light coming into\nher eyes.\n\n\"Yes; we told him this morning that mamma wanted us to take some old\nlinen to the lame man at Scaurside Farm, and that we meant to coax\nMrs Denbigh to let us go into the wood and gather strawberries,\" said\nElizabeth.\n\n\"I thought he would make some excuse and come,\" said the quick-witted\nMary, as eager and thoughtless an observer of one love-affair as\nof another, and quite forgetting that, not many weeks ago, she had\nfancied an attachment between him and Jemima.\n\n\"Did you? I did not,\" replied Elizabeth. \"At least I never thought\nabout it. I was quite startled when I heard his horse's feet behind\nus on the road.\"\n\n\"He said he was going to the farm, and could take our basket. Was not\nit kind of him?\" Jemima did not answer, so Mary continued:\n\n\"You know it's a great pull up to the farm, and we were so hot\nalready. The road was quite white and baked; it hurt my eyes\nterribly. I was so glad when Mrs Denbigh said we might turn into the\nwood. The light was quite green there, the branches are so thick\noverhead.\"\n\n\"And there are whole beds of wild strawberries,\" said Elizabeth,\ntaking up the tale now Mary was out of breath. Mary fanned herself\nwith her bonnet, while Elizabeth went on:\n\n\"You know where the grey rock crops out, don't you, Jemima? Well,\nthere was a complete carpet of strawberry runners. So pretty! And we\ncould hardly step without treading the little bright scarlet berries\nunder foot.\"\n\n\"We did so wish for Leonard,\" put in Mary.\n\n\"Yes! but Mrs Denbigh gathered a great many for him. And Mr Farquhar\ngave her all his.\"\n\n\"I thought you said he had gone on to Dawson's farm,\" said Jemima.\n\n\"Oh, yes! he just went up there; and then he left his horse there,\nlike a wise man, and came to us in the pretty, cool, green wood. Oh,\nJemima, it was so pretty--little flecks of light coming down here and\nthere through the leaves, and quivering on the ground. You must go\nwith us to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mary, \"we're going again to-morrow. We could not gather\nnearly all the strawberries.\"\n\n\"And Leonard is to go too, to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yes! we thought of such a capital plan. That's to say, Mr Farquhar\nthought of it--we wanted to carry Leonard up the hill in a king's\ncushion, but Mrs Denbigh would not hear of it.\"\n\n\"She said it would tire us so; and yet she wanted him to gather\nstrawberries!\"\n\n\"And so,\" interrupted Mary, for by this time the two girls were\nalmost speaking together, \"Mr Farquhar is to bring him up before him\non his horse.\"\n\n\"You'll go with us, won't you, dear Jemima?\" asked Elizabeth; \"it\nwill be at--\"\n\n\"No! I can't go!\" said Jemima, abruptly. \"Don't ask me--I can't.\"\n\nThe little girls were hushed into silence by her manner; for whatever\nshe might be to those above her in age and position, to those below\nher Jemima was almost invariably gentle. She felt that they were\nwondering at her.\n\n\"Go upstairs and take off your things. You know papa does not like\nyou to come into this room in the shoes in which you have been out.\"\n\nShe was glad to cut her sisters short in the details which they were\nso mercilessly inflicting--details which she must harden herself to,\nbefore she could hear them quietly and unmoved. She saw that she had\nlost her place as the first object in Mr Farquhar's eyes--a position\nshe had hardly cared for while she was secure in the enjoyment of it;\nbut the charm of it now was redoubled, in her acute sense of how she\nhad forfeited it by her own doing, and her own fault. For if he were\nthe cold, calculating man her father had believed him to be, and had\nrepresented him as being to her, would he care for a portionless\nwidow in humble circumstances like Mrs Denbigh; no money, no\nconnexion, encumbered with her boy? The very action which proved Mr\nFarquhar to be lost to Jemima reinstated him on his throne in her\nfancy. And she must go on in hushed quietness, quivering with every\nfresh token of his preference for another! That other, too, one so\ninfinitely more worthy of him than herself; so that she could not\nhave even the poor comfort of thinking that he had no discrimination,\nand was throwing himself away on a common or worthless person. Ruth\nwas beautiful, gentle, good, and conscientious. The hot colour\nflushed up into Jemima's sallow face as she became aware that, even\nwhile she acknowledged these excellences on Mrs Denbigh's part, she\nhated her. The recollection of her marble face wearied her even to\nsickness; the tones of her low voice were irritating from their very\nsoftness. Her goodness, undoubted as it was, was more distasteful\nthan many faults which had more savour of human struggle in them.\n\n\"What was this terrible demon in her heart?\" asked Jemima's better\nangel. \"Was she, indeed, given up to possession? Was not this the old\nstinging hatred which had prompted so many crimes? The hatred of all\nsweet virtues which might win the love denied to us? The old anger\nthat wrought in the elder brother's heart, till it ended in the\nmurder of the gentle Abel, while yet the world was young?\"\n\n\"Oh, God! help me! I did not know I was so wicked,\" cried Jemima\naloud in her agony. It had been a terrible glimpse into the dark,\nlurid gulf--the capability for evil, in her heart. She wrestled with\nthe demon, but he would not depart; it was to be a struggle whether\nor not she was to be given up to him, in this her time of sore\ntemptation.\n\nAll the next day long she sat and pictured the happy strawberry\ngathering going on, even then, in pleasant Scaurside Wood. Every\ntouch of fancy which could heighten her idea of their enjoyment, and\nof Mr Farquhar's attention to the blushing, conscious Ruth--every\nsuch touch which would add a pang to her self-reproach and keen\njealousy, was added by her imagination. She got up and walked about,\nto try and stop her over-busy fancy by bodily exercise. But she had\neaten little all day, and was weak and faint in the intense heat of\nthe sunny garden. Even the long grass-walk under the filbert-hedge,\nwas parched and dry in the glowing August sun. Yet her sisters found\nher there when they returned, walking quickly up and down, as if to\nwarm herself on some winter's day. They were very weary; and not half\nso communicative as on the day before, now that Jemima was craving\nfor every detail to add to her agony.\n\n\"Yes! Leonard came up before Mr Farquhar. Oh! how hot it is, Jemima;\ndo sit down, and I'll tell you about it, but I can't if you keep\nwalking so!\"\n\n\"I can't sit still to-day,\" said Jemima, springing up from the turf\nas soon as she had sat down. \"Tell me! I can hear you while I walk\nabout.\"\n\n\"Oh! but I can't shout; I can hardly speak I am so tired. Mr Farquhar\nbrought Leonard--\"\n\n\"You've told me that before,\" said Jemima, sharply.\n\n\"Well! I don't know what else to tell. Somebody had been since\nyesterday, and gathered nearly all the strawberries off the grey\nrock. Jemima! Jemima!\" said Elizabeth, faintly, \"I am so dizzy--I\nthink I am ill.\"\n\nThe next minute the tired girl lay swooning on the grass. It was an\noutlet for Jemima's fierce energy. With a strength she had never\nagain, and never had known before, she lifted up her fainting sister,\nand bidding Mary run and clear the way, she carried her in through\nthe open garden-door, up the wide old-fashioned stairs, and laid her\non the bed in her own room, where the breeze from the window came\nsoftly and pleasantly through the green shade of the vine-leaves and\njessamine.\n\n\"Give me the water. Run for mamma, Mary,\" said Jemima, as she\nsaw that the fainting-fit did not yield to the usual remedy of a\nhorizontal position and the water sprinkling.\n\n\"Dear! dear Lizzie!\" said Jemima, kissing the pale, unconscious face.\n\"I think you loved me, darling.\"\n\nThe long walk on the hot day had been too much for the delicate\nElizabeth, who was fast outgrowing her strength. It was many days\nbefore she regained any portion of her spirit and vigour. After\nthat fainting-fit, she lay listless and weary, without appetite or\ninterest, through the long sunny autumn weather, on the bed or on the\ncouch in Jemima's room, whither she had been carried at first. It was\na comfort to Mrs Bradshaw to be able at once to discover what it was\nthat had knocked up Elizabeth; she did not rest easily until she had\nsettled upon a cause for every ailment or illness in the family. It\nwas a stern consolation to Mr Bradshaw, during his time of anxiety\nrespecting his daughter, to be able to blame somebody. He could not,\nlike his wife, have taken comfort from an inanimate fact; he wanted\nthe satisfaction of feeling that some one had been in fault, or else\nthis never could have happened. Poor Ruth did not need his implied\nreproaches. When she saw her gentle Elizabeth lying feeble and\nlanguid, her heart blamed her for thoughtlessness so severely as to\nmake her take all Mr Bradshaw's words and hints as too light censure\nfor the careless way in which, to please her own child, she had\nallowed her two pupils to fatigue themselves with such long walks.\nShe begged hard to take her share of nursing. Every spare moment\nshe went to Mr Bradshaw's, and asked, with earnest humility, to be\nallowed to pass them with Elizabeth; and, as it was often a relief\nto have her assistance, Mrs Bradshaw received these entreaties very\nkindly, and desired her to go upstairs, where Elizabeth's pale\ncountenance brightened when she saw her, but where Jemima sat in\nsilent annoyance that her own room was now become open ground for\none, whom her heart rose up against, to enter in and be welcomed.\nWhether it was that Ruth, who was not an inmate of the house, brought\nwith her a fresher air, more change of thought to the invalid, I do\nnot know, but Elizabeth always gave her a peculiarly tender greeting;\nand if she had sunk down into languid fatigue, in spite of all\nJemima's endeavours to interest her, she roused up into animation\nwhen Ruth came in with a flower, a book, or a brown and ruddy pear,\nsending out the warm fragrance it retained from the sunny garden-wall\nat Chapel-house.\n\nThe jealous dislike which Jemima was allowing to grow up in her heart\nagainst Ruth was, as she thought, never shown in word or deed. She\nwas cold in manner, because she could not be hypocritical; but her\nwords were polite and kind in purport; and she took pains to make\nher actions the same as formerly. But rule and line may measure out\nthe figure of a man; it is the soul that gives it life; and there\nwas no soul, no inner meaning, breathing out in Jemima's actions.\nRuth felt the change acutely. She suffered from it some time before\nshe ventured to ask what had occasioned it. But, one day, she took\nMiss Bradshaw by surprise, when they were alone together for a few\nminutes, by asking her if she had vexed her in any way, she was so\nchanged? It is sad when friendship has cooled so far as to render\nsuch a question necessary. Jemima went rather paler than usual, and\nthen made answer:\n\n\"Changed! How do you mean? How am I changed? What do I say or do\ndifferent from what I used to do?\"\n\nBut the tone was so constrained and cold, that Ruth's heart sank\nwithin her. She knew now, as well as words could have told her, that\nnot only had the old feeling of love passed away from Jemima, but\nthat it had gone unregretted, and no attempt had been made to recall\nit. Love was very precious to Ruth now, as of old time. It was one of\nthe faults of her nature to be ready to make any sacrifices for those\nwho loved her, and to value affection almost above its price. She\nhad yet to learn the lesson, that it is more blessed to love than\nto be beloved; and lonely as the impressible years of her youth had\nbeen--without parents, without brother or sister--it was, perhaps,\nno wonder that she clung tenaciously to every symptom of regard, and\ncould not relinquish the love of any one without a pang.\n\nThe doctor who was called in to Elizabeth prescribed sea-air as the\nbest means of recruiting her strength. Mr Bradshaw, who liked to\nspend money ostentatiously, went down straight to Abermouth, and\nengaged a house for the remainder of the autumn; for, as he told\nthe medical man, money was no object to him in comparison with his\nchildren's health; and the doctor cared too little about the mode in\nwhich his remedy was administered, to tell Mr Bradshaw that lodgings\nwould have done as well, or better, than the complete house he had\nseen fit to take. For it was now necessary to engage servants, and\ntake much trouble, which might have been obviated, and Elizabeth's\nremoval effected more quietly and speedily, if she had gone into\nlodgings. As it was, she was weary of hearing all the planning and\ntalking, and deciding and un-deciding, and re-deciding, before it was\npossible for her to go. Her only comfort was in the thought that dear\nMrs Denbigh was to go with her.\n\nIt had not been entirely by way of pompously spending his money that\nMr Bradshaw had engaged this seaside house. He was glad to get his\nlittle girls and their governess out of the way; for a busy time was\nimpending, when he should want his head clear for electioneering\npurposes, and his house clear for electioneering hospitality. He was\nthe mover of a project for bringing forward a man on the Liberal\nand Dissenting interest, to contest the election with the old Tory\nmember, who had on several successive occasions walked over the\ncourse, as he and his family owned half the town, and votes and rent\nwere paid alike to the landlord.\n\nKings of Eccleston had Mr Cranworth and his ancestors been this many\na long year; their right was so little disputed that they never\nthought of acknowledging the allegiance so readily paid to them.\nThe old feudal feeling between land-owner and tenant did not quake\nprophetically at the introduction of manufactures; the Cranworth\nfamily ignored the growing power of the manufacturers, more\nespecially as the principal person engaged in the trade was a\nDissenter. But notwithstanding this lack of patronage from the\none great family in the neighbourhood, the business flourished,\nincreased, and spread wide; and the Dissenting head thereof\nlooked around, about the time of which I speak, and felt himself\npowerful enough to defy the great Cranworth interest even in their\nhereditary stronghold, and, by so doing, avenge the slights of many\nyears--slights which rankled in Mr Bradshaw's mind as much as if he\ndid not go to chapel twice every Sunday, and pay the largest pew-rent\nof any member of Mr Benson's congregation.\n\nAccordingly, Mr Bradshaw had applied to one of the Liberal\nparliamentary agents in London--a man whose only principle was to do\nwrong on the Liberal side; he would not act, right or wrong, for a\nTory, but for a Whig the latitude of his conscience had never yet\nbeen discovered. It was possible Mr Bradshaw was not aware of the\ncharacter of this agent; at any rate, he knew he was the man for his\npurpose, which was to hear of some one who would come forward as\na candidate for the representation of Eccleston on the Dissenting\ninterest.\n\n\"There are in round numbers about six hundred voters,\" said he; \"two\nhundred are decidedly in the Cranworth interest--dare not offend Mr\nCranworth, poor souls! Two hundred more we may calculate upon as\npretty certain--factory hands, or people connected with our trade\nin some way or another--who are indignant at the stubborn way in\nwhich Cranworth has contested the right of water; two hundred are\ndoubtful.\"\n\n\"Don't much care either way,\" said the parliamentary agent. \"Of\ncourse, we must make them care.\"\n\nMr Bradshaw rather shrunk from the knowing look with which this was\nsaid. He hoped that Mr Pilson did not mean to allude to bribery; but\nhe did not express this hope, because he thought it would deter the\nagent from using this means, and it was possible it might prove to\nbe the only way. And if he (Mr Bradshaw) once embarked on such an\nenterprise, there must be no failure. By some expedient or another,\nsuccess must be certain, or he could have nothing to do with it.\n\nThe parliamentary agent was well accustomed to deal with all kinds\nand shades of scruples. He was most at home with men who had none;\nbut still he could allow for human weakness; and he perfectly\nunderstood Mr Bradshaw.\n\n\"I have a notion I know of a man who will just suit your purpose.\nPlenty of money--does not know what to do with it, in fact--tired of\nyachting, travelling; wants something new. I heard, through some of\nthe means of intelligence I employ, that not very long ago he was\nwishing for a seat in Parliament.\"\n\n\"A Liberal?\" said Mr Bradshaw.\n\n\"Decidedly. Belongs to a family who were in the Long Parliament in\ntheir day.\"\n\nMr Bradshaw rubbed his hands.\n\n\"Dissenter?\" asked he.\n\n\"No, no! Not so far as that. But very lax Church.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\" asked Mr Bradshaw, eagerly.\n\n\"Excuse me. Until I am certain that he would like to come forward for\nEccleston, I think I had better not mention his name.\"\n\nThe anonymous gentleman did like to come forward, and his name proved\nto be Donne. He and Mr Bradshaw had been in correspondence during\nall the time of Mr Ralph Cranworth's illness; and when he died,\neverything was arranged ready for a start, even before the Cranworths\nhad determined who should keep the seat warm till the eldest son came\nof age, for the father was already member for the county. Mr Donne\nwas to come down to canvass in person, and was to take up his abode\nat Mr Bradshaw's; and therefore it was that the seaside house, within\ntwenty miles' distance of Eccleston, was found to be so convenient\nas an infirmary and nursery for those members of his family who\nwere likely to be useless, if not positive encumbrances, during the\nforthcoming election.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nThe Liberal Candidate and His Precursor\n\n\nJemima did not know whether she wished to go to Abermouth or not.\nShe longed for change. She wearied of the sights and sounds of\nhome. But yet she could not bear to leave the neighbourhood of Mr\nFarquhar; especially as, if she went to Abermouth, Ruth would in all\nprobability be left to take her holiday at home.\n\nWhen Mr Bradshaw decided that she was to go, Ruth tried to feel glad\nthat he gave her the means of repairing her fault towards Elizabeth;\nand she resolved to watch over the two girls most faithfully and\ncarefully, and to do all in her power to restore the invalid to\nhealth. But a tremor came over her whenever she thought of leaving\nLeonard; she had never quitted him for a day, and it seemed to her as\nif her brooding, constant care was his natural and necessary shelter\nfrom all evils--from very death itself. She would not go to sleep at\nnights, in order to enjoy the blessed consciousness of having him\nnear her; when she was away from him teaching her pupils, she kept\ntrying to remember his face, and print it deep on her heart, against\nthe time when days and days would elapse without her seeing that\nlittle darling countenance. Miss Benson would wonder to her brother\nthat Mr Bradshaw did not propose that Leonard should accompany his\nmother; he only begged her not to put such an idea into Ruth's head,\nas he was sure Mr Bradshaw had no thoughts of doing any such thing,\nyet to Ruth it might be a hope, and then a disappointment. His sister\nscolded him for being so cold-hearted; but he was full of sympathy,\nalthough he did not express it, and made some quiet little sacrifices\nin order to set himself at liberty to take Leonard a long walking\nexpedition on the day when his mother left Eccleston.\n\nRuth cried until she could cry no longer, and felt very much ashamed\nof herself as she saw the grave and wondering looks of her pupils,\nwhose only feeling on leaving home was delight at the idea of\nAbermouth, and into whose minds the possibility of death to any of\ntheir beloved ones never entered. Ruth dried her eyes, and spoke\ncheerfully as soon as she caught the perplexed expression of their\nfaces; and by the time they arrived at Abermouth, she was as much\ndelighted with all the new scenery as they were, and found it hard\nwork to resist their entreaties to go rambling out on the seashore at\nonce; but Elizabeth had undergone more fatigue that day than she had\nhad before for many weeks, and Ruth was determined to be prudent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bradshaws' house at Eccleston was being rapidly\nadapted for electioneering hospitality. The partition-wall between\nthe unused drawing-room and the school-room was broken down, in order\nto admit of folding doors; the \"ingenious\" upholsterer of the town\n(and what town does not boast of the upholsterer full of contrivances\nand resources, in opposition to the upholsterer of steady capital and\nno imagination, who looks down with uneasy contempt on ingenuity?)\nhad come in to give his opinion, that \"nothing could be easier than\nto convert a bathroom into a bedroom, by the assistance of a little\ndrapery to conceal the shower-bath,\" the string of which was to be\ncarefully concealed, for fear that the unconscious occupier of the\nbath-bed might innocently take it for a bell-rope. The professional\ncook of the town had been already engaged to take up her abode for a\nmonth at Mr Bradshaw's, much to the indignation of Betsy, who became\na vehement partisan of Mr Cranworth, as soon as ever she heard of the\nplan of her deposition from sovereign authority in the kitchen, in\nwhich she had reigned supreme for fourteen years. Mrs Bradshaw sighed\nand bemoaned herself in all her leisure moments, which were not many,\nand wondered why their house was to be turned into an inn for this\nMr Donne, when everybody knew that the George was good enough for\nthe Cranworths, who never thought of asking the electors to the\nHall;--and they had lived at Cranworth ever since Julius Caesar's\ntime, and if that was not being an old family, she did not know what\nwas. The excitement soothed Jemima. There was something to do. It was\nshe who planned with the upholsterer; it was she who soothed Betsy\ninto angry silence; it was she who persuaded her mother to lie down\nand rest, while she herself went out to buy the heterogeneous things\nrequired to make the family and house presentable to Mr Donne and\nhis precursor--the friend of the parliamentary agent. This latter\ngentleman never appeared himself on the scene of action, but pulled\nall the strings notwithstanding. The friend was a Mr Hickson, a\nlawyer--a briefless barrister, some people called him; but he himself\nprofessed a great disgust to the law, as a \"great sham,\" which\ninvolved an immensity of underhand action, and truckling, and\ntime-serving, and was perfectly encumbered by useless forms and\nceremonies, and dead obsolete words. So, instead of putting his\nshoulder to the wheel to reform the law, he talked eloquently against\nit, in such a high-priest style, that it was occasionally a matter of\nsurprise how he could ever have made a friend of the parliamentary\nagent before mentioned. But, as Mr Hickson himself said, it was the\nvery corruptness of the law which he was fighting against, in doing\nall he could to effect the return of certain members to Parliament;\nthese certain members being pledged to effect a reform in the law,\naccording to Mr Hickson. And, as he once observed confidentially, \"If\nyou had to destroy a hydra-headed monster, would you measure swords\nwith the demon as if he were a gentleman? Would you not rather seize\nthe first weapon that came to hand? And so do I. My great object in\nlife, sir, is to reform the law of England, sir. Once get a majority\nof Liberal members into the House, and the thing is done. And I\nconsider myself justified, for so high--for, I may say, so holy--an\nend, in using men's weaknesses to work out my purpose. Of course, if\nmen were angels, or even immaculate--men invulnerable to bribes, we\nwould not bribe.\"\n\n\"Could you?\" asked Jemima, for the conversation took place at Mr\nBradshaw's dinner-table, where a few friends were gathered together\nto meet Mr Hickson; and among them was Mr Benson.\n\n\"We neither would nor could,\" said the ardent barrister, disregarding\nin his vehemence the point of the question, and floating on over the\nbar of argument into the wide ocean of his own eloquence: \"As it\nis--as the world stands, they who would succeed even in good deeds\nmust come down to the level of expediency; and therefore, I say once\nmore, if Mr Donne is the man for your purpose, and your purpose is\na good one, a lofty one, a holy one\" (for Mr Hickson remembered the\nDissenting character of his little audience, and privately considered\nthe introduction of the word \"holy\" a most happy hit), \"then, I say,\nwe must put all the squeamish scruples which might befit Utopia, or\nsome such place, on one side, and treat men as they are. If they are\navaricious, it is not we who have made them so; but as we have to\ndo with them, we must consider their failings in dealing with them;\nif they have been careless or extravagant, or have had their little\npeccadillos, we must administer the screw. The glorious reform of the\nlaw will justify, in my idea, all means to obtain the end--that law,\nfrom the profession of which I have withdrawn myself from perhaps a\ntoo scrupulous conscience!\" he concluded softly to himself.\n\n\"We are not to do evil that good may come,\" said Mr Benson. He was\nstartled at the deep sound of his own voice as he uttered these\nwords; but he had not been speaking for some time, and his voice came\nforth strong and unmodulated.\n\n\"True, sir; most true,\" said Mr Hickson, bowing. \"I honour you for\nthe observation.\" And he profited by it, insomuch that he confined\nhis further remarks on elections to the end of the table, where\nhe sat near Mr Bradshaw, and one or two equally eager, though not\nequally influential partisans of Mr Donne's. Meanwhile, Mr Farquhar\ntook up Mr Benson's quotation, at the end where he and Jemima sat\nnear to Mrs Bradshaw and him.\n\n\"But in the present state of the world, as Mr Hickson says, it is\nrather difficult to act upon that precept.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr Farquhar!\" said Jemima, indignantly, the tears springing to\nher eyes with a feeling of disappointment. For she had been chafing\nunder all that Mr Hickson had been saying, perhaps the more for one\nor two attempts on his part at a flirtation with the daughter of\nhis wealthy host, which she resented with all the loathing of a\npre-occupied heart; and she had longed to be a man, to speak out her\nwrath at this paltering with right and wrong. She had felt grateful\nto Mr Benson for his one clear, short precept, coming down with a\ndivine force against which there was no appeal; and now to have Mr\nFarquhar taking the side of expediency! It was too bad.\n\n\"Nay, Jemima!\" said Mr Farquhar, touched, and secretly flattered by\nthe visible pain his speech had given. \"Don't be indignant with me\ntill I have explained myself a little more. I don't understand myself\nyet; and it is a very intricate question, or so it appears to me,\nwhich I was going to put, really, earnestly, and humbly, for Mr\nBenson's opinion. Now, Mr Benson, may I ask, if you always find it\npracticable to act strictly in accordance with that principle? For\nif you do not, I am sure no man living can! Are there not occasions\nwhen it is absolutely necessary to wade through evil to good? I am\nnot speaking in the careless, presumptuous way of that man yonder,\"\nsaid he, lowering his voice, and addressing himself to Jemima more\nexclusively; \"I am really anxious to hear what Mr Benson will say\non the subject, for I know no one to whose candid opinion I should\nattach more weight.\"\n\nBut Mr Benson was silent. He did not see Mrs Bradshaw and Jemima\nleave the room. He was really, as Mr Farquhar supposed him,\ncompletely absent, questioning himself as to how far his practice\ntallied with his principle. By degrees he came to himself; he found\nthe conversation still turned on the election; and Mr Hickson, who\nfelt that he had jarred against the little minister's principles,\nand yet knew, from the _carte du pays_ which the scouts of the\nparliamentary agent had given him, that Mr Benson was a person to be\nconciliated, on account of his influence over many of the working\npeople, began to ask him questions with an air of deferring to\nsuperior knowledge, that almost surprised Mr Bradshaw, who had been\naccustomed to treat \"Benson\" in a very different fashion, of civil\ncondescending indulgence, just as one listens to a child who can have\nhad no opportunities of knowing better.\n\nAt the end of a conversation that Mr Hickson held with Mr Benson, on\na subject in which the latter was really interested, and on which he\nhad expressed himself at some length, the young barrister turned to\nMr Bradshaw, and said very audibly,\n\n\"I wish Donne had been here. This conversation during the last\nhalf-hour would have interested him almost as much as it has done\nme.\"\n\nMr Bradshaw little guessed the truth, that Mr Donne was, at that\nvery moment, coaching up the various subjects of public interest in\nEccleston, and privately cursing the particular subject on which\nMr Benson had been holding forth, as being an unintelligible piece\nof Quixotism; or the leading Dissenter of the town need not have\nexperienced a pang of jealousy at the possible future admiration his\nminister might excite in the possible future member for Eccleston.\nAnd if Mr Benson had been clairvoyant, he need not have made an\nespecial subject of gratitude out of the likelihood that he might\nhave an opportunity of so far interesting Mr Donne in the condition\nof the people of Eccleston as to induce him to set his face against\nany attempts at bribery.\n\nMr Benson thought of this half the night through; and ended by\ndetermining to write a sermon on the Christian view of political\nduties, which might be good for all, both electors and member, to\nhear on the eve of an election. For Mr Donne was expected at Mr\nBradshaw's before the next Sunday; and, of course, as Mr and Miss\nBenson had settled it, he would appear at the chapel with them on\nthat day. But the stinging conscience refused to be quieted. No\npresent plan of usefulness allayed the aching remembrance of the evil\nhe had done that good might come. Not even the look of Leonard, as\nthe early dawn fell on him, and Mr Benson's sleepless eyes saw the\nrosy glow on his firm round cheeks; his open mouth, through which the\nsoft, long-drawn breath came gently quivering; and his eyes not fully\nshut, but closed to outward sight--not even the aspect of the quiet,\ninnocent child could soothe the troubled spirit.\n\nLeonard and his mother dreamt of each other that night. Her dream of\nhim was one of undefined terror--terror so great that it wakened her\nup, and she strove not to sleep again, for fear that ominous ghastly\ndream should return. He, on the contrary, dreamt of her sitting\nwatching and smiling by his bedside, as her gentle self had been many\na morning; and when she saw him awake (so it fell out in the dream),\nshe smiled still more sweetly, and bending down she kissed him, and\nthen spread out large, soft, white-feathered wings (which in no way\nsurprised her child--he seemed to have known they were there all\nalong), and sailed away through the open window far into the blue\nsky of a summer's day. Leonard wakened up then, and remembered how\nfar away she really was--far more distant and inaccessible than the\nbeautiful blue sky to which she had betaken herself in his dream--and\ncried himself to sleep again.\n\nIn spite of her absence from her child, which made one great and\nabiding sorrow, Ruth enjoyed her seaside visit exceedingly. In the\nfirst place, there was the delight of seeing Elizabeth's daily and\nalmost hourly improvement. Then, at the doctor's express orders,\nthere were so few lessons to be done, that there was time for the\nlong exploring rambles, which all three delighted in. And when the\nrain came and the storms blew, the house, with its wild sea-views,\nwas equally delightful.\n\nIt was a large house, built on the summit of a rock, which nearly\noverhung the shore below; there were, to be sure, a series of zigzag\ntacking paths down the face of this rock, but from the house they\ncould not be seen. Old or delicate people would have considered the\nsituation bleak and exposed; indeed, the present proprietor wanted to\ndispose of it on this very account; but by its present inhabitants,\nthis exposure and bleakness were called by other names, and\nconsidered as charms. From every part of the rooms they saw the grey\nstorms gather on the sea-horizon, and put themselves in marching\narray; and soon the march became a sweep, and the great dome of the\nheavens was covered with the lurid clouds, between which and the\nvivid green earth below there seemed to come a purple atmosphere,\nmaking the very threatening beautiful; and by-and-by the house was\nwrapped in sheets of rain shutting out sky, and sea, and inland view;\ntill, of a sudden, the storm was gone by, and the heavy rain-drops\nglistened in the sun as they hung on leaf and grass, and the \"little\nbirds sang east, and the little birds sang west,\" and there was a\npleasant sound of running waters all abroad.\n\n\"Oh! if papa would but buy this house!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, after\none such storm, which she had watched silently from the very\nbeginning of the \"little cloud no bigger than a man's hand.\"\n\n\"Mamma would never like it, I am afraid,\" said Mary. \"She would call\nour delicious gushes of air, draughts, and think we should catch\ncold.\"\n\n\"Jemima would be on our side. But how long Mrs Denbigh is! I hope she\nwas near enough the post-office when the rain came on!\"\n\nRuth had gone to \"the shop\" in the little village, about half-a-mile\ndistant, where all letters were left till fetched. She only expected\none, but that one was to tell her of Leonard. She, however, received\ntwo; the unexpected one was from Mr Bradshaw, and the news it\ncontained was, if possible, a greater surprise than the letter\nitself. Mr Bradshaw informed her, that he planned arriving by\ndinner-time the following Saturday at Eagle's Crag; and more, that he\nintended bringing Mr Donne and one or two other gentlemen with him,\nto spend the Sunday there! The letter went on to give every possible\ndirection regarding the household preparations. The dinner-hour was\nfixed to be at six; but, of course, Ruth and the girls would have\ndined long before. The (professional) cook would arrive the day\nbefore, laden with all the provisions that could not be obtained\non the spot. Ruth was to engage a waiter from the inn, and this it\nwas that detained her so long. While she sat in the little parlour,\nawaiting the coming of the landlady, she could not help wondering why\nMr Bradshaw was bringing this strange gentleman to spend two days\nat Abermouth, and thus giving himself so much trouble and fuss of\npreparation.\n\nThere were so many small reasons that went to make up the large one\nwhich had convinced Mr Bradshaw of the desirableness of this step,\nthat it was not likely that Ruth should guess at one half of them. In\nthe first place, Miss Benson, in the pride and fulness of her heart,\nhad told Mrs Bradshaw what her brother had told her; how he meant to\npreach upon the Christian view of the duties involved in political\nrights; and as, of course, Mrs Bradshaw had told Mr Bradshaw, he\nbegan to dislike the idea of attending chapel on that Sunday at all;\nfor he had an uncomfortable idea that by the Christian standard--that\ndivine test of the true and pure--bribery would not be altogether\napproved of; and yet he was tacitly coming round to the understanding\nthat \"packets\" would be required, for what purpose both he and Mr\nDonne were to be supposed to remain ignorant. But it would be very\nawkward, so near to the time, if he were to be clearly convinced that\nbribery, however disguised by names and words, was in plain terms\na sin. And yet he knew Mr Benson had once or twice convinced him\nagainst his will of certain things, which he had thenceforward found\nit impossible to do, without such great uneasiness of mind, that he\nhad left off doing them, which was sadly against his interest. And if\nMr Donne (whom he had intended to take with him to chapel, as fair\nDissenting prey) should also become convinced, why, the Cranworths\nwould win the day, and he should be the laughing-stock of Eccleston.\nNo! in this one case bribery must be allowed--was allowable; but\nit was a great pity human nature was so corrupt, and if his member\nsucceeded, he would double his subscription to the schools, in order\nthat the next generation might be taught better. There were various\nother reasons, which strengthened Mr Bradshaw in the bright idea\nof going down to Abermouth for the Sunday; some connected with the\nout-of-door politics, and some with the domestic. For instance,\nit had been the plan of the house to have a cold dinner on the\nSundays--Mr Bradshaw had piqued himself on this strictness--and yet\nhe had an instinctive feeling that Mr Donne was not quite the man to\npartake of cold meat for conscience' sake with cheerful indifference\nto his fare.\n\nMr Donne had, in fact, taken the Bradshaw household a little by\nsurprise. Before he came, Mr Bradshaw had pleased himself with\nthinking, that more unlikely things had happened than the espousal\nof his daughter with the member of a small borough. But this pretty\nairy bubble burst as soon as he saw Mr Donne; and its very existence\nwas forgotten in less than half an hour, when he felt the quiet but\nincontestible difference of rank and standard that there was, in\nevery respect, between his guest and his own family. It was not\nthrough any circumstance so palpable, and possibly accidental, as the\nbringing down a servant, whom Mr Donne seemed to consider as much\na matter of course as a carpet-bag (though the smart gentleman's\narrival \"fluttered the Volscians in Corioli\" considerably more\nthan his gentle-spoken master's). It was nothing like this; it was\nsomething indescribable--a quiet being at ease, and expecting every\none else to be so--an attention to women, which was so habitual as\nto be unconsciously exercised to those subordinate persons in Mr\nBradshaw's family--a happy choice of simple and expressive words,\nsome of which it must be confessed were slang, but fashionable\nslang, and that makes all the difference--a measured, graceful way\nof utterance, with a style of pronunciation quite different to\nthat of Eccleston. All these put together make but a part of the\nindescribable whole which unconsciously affected Mr Bradshaw, and\nestablished Mr Donne in his estimation as a creature quite different\nto any he had seen before, and as most unfit to mate with Jemima. Mr\nHickson, who had appeared as a model of gentlemanly ease before Mr\nDonne's arrival, now became vulgar and coarse in Mr Bradshaw's eyes.\nAnd yet, such was the charm of that languid, high-bred manner, that\nMr Bradshaw \"cottoned\" (as he expressed it to Mr Farquhar) to his\nnew candidate at once. He was only afraid lest Mr Donne was too\nindifferent to all things under the sun to care whether he gained or\nlost the election; but he was reassured after the first conversation\nthey had together on the subject. Mr Donne's eye lightened with an\neagerness that was almost fierce, though his tones were as musical,\nand nearly as slow, as ever; and when Mr Bradshaw alluded distantly\nto \"probable expenses\" and \"packets,\" Mr Donne replied,\n\n\"Oh, of course! disagreeable necessity! Better speak as little about\nsuch things as possible; other people can be found to arrange all the\ndirty work. Neither you nor I would like to soil our fingers by it, I\nam sure. Four thousand pounds are in Mr Pilson's hands, and I shall\nnever inquire what becomes of them; they may, very probably, be\nabsorbed in the law expenses, you know. I shall let it be clearly\nunderstood from the hustings, that I most decidedly disapprove of\nbribery, and leave the rest to Hickson's management. He is accustomed\nto these sort of things. I am not.\"\n\nMr Bradshaw was rather perplexed by this want of bustling energy on\nthe part of the new candidate; and if it had not been for the four\nthousand pounds aforesaid, would have doubted whether Mr Donne\ncared sufficiently for the result of the election. Jemima thought\ndifferently. She watched her father's visitor attentively, with\nsomething like the curious observation which a naturalist bestows on\na new species of animal.\n\n\"Do you know what Mr Donne reminds me of, mamma?\" said she, one day,\nas the two sat at work, while the gentlemen were absent canvassing.\n\n\"No! he is not like anybody I ever saw. He quite frightens me, by\nbeing so ready to open the door for me if I am going out of the room,\nand by giving me a chair when I come in. I never saw any one like\nhim. Who is it, Jemima?\"\n\n\"Not any person--not any human being, mamma,\" said Jemima, half\nsmiling. \"Do you remember our stopping at Wakefield once, on our way\nto Scarborough, and there were horse-races going on somewhere, and\nsome of the racers were in the stables at the inn where we dined?\"\n\n\"Yes! I remember it; but what about that?\"\n\n\"Why, Richard, somehow, knew one of the jockeys, and, as we were\ncoming in from our ramble through the town, this man, or boy, asked\nus to look at one of the racers he had the charge of.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear!\"\n\n\"Well, mamma! Mr Donne is like that horse!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Jemima; you must not say so. I don't know what your father\nwould say, if he heard you likening Mr Donne to a brute.\"\n\n\"Brutes are sometimes very beautiful, mamma. I am sure I should think\nit a compliment to be likened to a race-horse, such as the one we\nsaw. But the thing in which they are alike, is the sort of repressed\neagerness in both.\"\n\n\"Eager! Why, I should say there never was any one cooler than Mr\nDonne. Think of the trouble your papa has had this month past, and\nthen remember the slow way in which Mr Donne moves when he is going\nout to canvass, and the low, drawling voice in which he questions the\npeople who bring him intelligence. I can see your papa standing by,\nready to shake them to get out their news.\"\n\n\"But Mr Donne's questions are always to the point, and force out the\ngrain without the chaff. And look at him, if any one tells him ill\nnews about the election! Have you never seen a dull red light come\ninto his eyes? That is like my race-horse. Her flesh quivered all\nover, at certain sounds and noises which had some meaning to her;\nbut she stood quite still, pretty creature! Now, Mr Donne is just as\neager as she was, though he may be too proud to show it. Though he\nseems so gentle, I almost think he is very headstrong in following\nout his own will.\"\n\n\"Well! don't call him like a horse again, for I am sure papa would\nnot like it. Do you know, I thought you were going to say he was like\nlittle Leonard, when you asked me who he was like.\"\n\n\"Leonard! Oh, mamma, he is not in the least like Leonard. He is\ntwenty times more like my race-horse.\n\n\"Now, my dear Jemima, do be quiet. Your father thinks racing so\nwrong, that I am sure he would be very seriously displeased if he\nwere to hear you.\"\n\nTo return to Mr Bradshaw, and to give one more of his various reasons\nfor wishing to take Mr Donne to Abermouth. The wealthy Eccleston\nmanufacturer was uncomfortably impressed with an indefinable sense of\ninferiority to his visitor. It was not in education, for Mr Bradshaw\nwas a well-educated man; it was not in power, for, if he chose, the\npresent object of Mr Donne's life might be utterly defeated; it\ndid not arise from anything overbearing in manner, for Mr Donne\nwas habitually polite and courteous, and was just now anxious to\npropitiate his host, whom he looked upon as a very useful man.\nWhatever this sense of inferiority arose from, Mr Bradshaw was\nanxious to relieve himself of it, and imagined that if he could make\nmore display of his wealth his object would be obtained. Now his\nhouse in Eccleston was old-fashioned, and ill-calculated to exhibit\nmoney's worth. His mode of living, though strained to a high pitch\njust at this time, he became aware was no more than Mr Donne was\naccustomed to every day of his life. The first day at dessert, some\nremark (some opportune remark, as Mr Bradshaw in his innocence had\nthought) was made regarding the price of pine-apples, which was\nrather exorbitant that year, and Mr Donne asked Mrs Bradshaw, with\nquiet surprise, if they had no pinery, as if to be without a pinery\nwere indeed a depth of pitiable destitution. In fact, Mr Donne had\nbeen born and cradled in all that wealth could purchase, and so had\nhis ancestors before him for so many generations, that refinement\nand luxury seemed the natural condition of man, and they that dwelt\nwithout were in the position of monsters. The absence was noticed;\nbut not the presence.\n\nNow, Mr Bradshaw knew that the house and grounds of Eagle's Crag were\nexorbitantly dear, and yet he really thought of purchasing them. And\nas one means of exhibiting his wealth, and so raising himself up to\nthe level of Mr Donne, he thought that if he could take the latter\ndown to Abermouth, and show him the place for which, \"because his\nlittle girls had taken a fancy to it,\" he was willing to give the\nfancy-price of fourteen thousand pounds, he should at last make those\nhalf-shut dreamy eyes open wide, and their owner confess that, in\nwealth at least, the Eccleston manufacturer stood on a par with him.\n\nAll these mingled motives caused the determination which made Ruth\nsit in the little inn-parlour at Abermouth during the wild storm's\npassage.\n\nShe wondered if she had fulfilled all Mr Bradshaw's directions. She\nlooked at the letter. Yes! everything was done. And now home with her\nnews, through the wet lane, where the little pools by the roadside\nreflected the deep blue sky and the round white clouds with even\ndeeper blue and clearer white; and the rain-drops hung so thick on\nthe trees, that even a little bird's flight was enough to shake them\ndown in a bright shower as of rain. When she told the news, Mary\nexclaimed,\n\n\"Oh, how charming! Then we shall see this new member after all!\"\nwhile Elizabeth added,\n\n\"Yes! I shall like to do that. But where must we be? Papa will want\nthe dining-room and this room, and where must we sit?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Ruth, \"in the dressing-room next to my room. All that your\npapa wants always, is that you are quiet and out of the way.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nRecognition\n\n\nSaturday came. Torn, ragged clouds were driven across the sky. It was\nnot a becoming day for the scenery, and the little girls regretted it\nmuch. First they hoped for a change at twelve o'clock, and then at\nthe afternoon tide-turning. But at neither time did the sun show his\nface.\n\n\"Papa will never buy this dear place,\" said Elizabeth, sadly, as she\nwatched the weather. \"The sun is everything to it. The sea looks\nquite leaden to-day, and there is no sparkle on it. And the sands,\nthat were so yellow and sun-speckled on Thursday, are all one dull\nbrown now.\"\n\n\"Never mind! to-morrow may be better,\" said Ruth, cheerily.\n\n\"I wonder what time they will come at?\" inquired Mary.\n\n\"Your papa said they would be at the station at five o'clock. And\nthe landlady at the Swan said it would take them half an hour to get\nhere.\"\n\n\"And they are to dine at six?\" asked Elizabeth.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Ruth. \"And I think if we had our tea half an hour\nearlier, at half-past four, and then went out for a walk, we should\nbe nicely out of the way just during the bustle of the arrival and\ndinner; and we could be in the drawing-room ready against your papa\ncame in after dinner.\"\n\n\"Oh! that would be nice,\" said they; and tea was ordered accordingly.\n\nThe south-westerly wind had dropped, and the clouds were stationary,\nwhen they went out on the sands. They dug little holes near the\nin-coming tide, and made canals to them from the water, and blew the\nlight sea-foam against each other; and then stole on tiptoe near to\nthe groups of grey and white sea-gulls, which despised their caution,\nflying softly and slowly away to a little distance as soon as they\ndrew near. And in all this Ruth was as great a child as any. Only she\nlonged for Leonard with a mother's longing, as indeed she did every\nday, and all hours of the day. By-and-by the clouds thickened yet\nmore, and one or two drops of rain were felt. It was very little, but\nRuth feared a shower for her delicate Elizabeth, and besides, the\nSeptember evening was fast closing in the dark and sunless day. As\nthey turned homewards in the rapidly increasing dusk, they saw three\nfigures on the sand near the rocks, coming in their direction.\n\n\"Papa and Mr Donne!\" exclaimed Mary. \"Now we shall see him!\"\n\n\"Which do you make out is him?\" asked Elizabeth.\n\n\"Oh! the tall one, to be sure. Don't you see how papa always turns to\nhim, as if he was speaking to him and not to the other?\"\n\n\"Who is the other?\" asked Elizabeth.\n\n\"Mr Bradshaw said that Mr Farquhar and Mr Hickson would come with\nhim. But that is not Mr Farquhar, I am sure,\" said Ruth.\n\nThe girls looked at each other, as they always did, when Ruth\nmentioned Mr Farquhar's name; but she was perfectly unconscious both\nof the look and of the conjectures which gave rise to it.\n\nAs soon as the two parties drew near, Mr Bradshaw called out in his\nstrong voice,\n\n\"Well, my dears! we found there was an hour before dinner, so we came\ndown upon the sands, and here you are.\"\n\nThe tone of his voice assured them that he was in a bland and\nindulgent mood, and the two little girls ran towards him. He kissed\nthem, and shook hands with Ruth; told his companions that these\nwere the little girls who were tempting him to this extravagance of\npurchasing Eagle's Crag; and then, rather doubtfully, and because\nhe saw that Mr Donne expected it, he introduced \"My daughters'\ngoverness, Mrs Denbigh.\"\n\nIt was growing darker every moment, and it was time they should\nhasten back to the rocks, which were even now indistinct in the grey\nhaze. Mr Bradshaw held a hand of each of his daughters, and Ruth\nwalked alongside, the two strange gentlemen being on the outskirts of\nthe party.\n\nMr Bradshaw began to give his little girls some home news. He told\nthem that Mr Farquhar was ill, and could not accompany them; but\nJemima and their mamma were quite well.\n\nThe gentleman nearest to Ruth spoke to her.\n\n\"Are you fond of the sea?\" asked he. There was no answer, so he\nrepeated his question in a different form.\n\n\"Do you enjoy staying by the seaside? I should rather ask.\"\n\nThe reply was \"Yes,\" rather breathed out in a deep inspiration than\nspoken in a sound. The sands heaved and trembled beneath Ruth. The\nfigures near her vanished into strange nothingness; the sounds of\ntheir voices were as distant sounds in a dream, while the echo of one\nvoice thrilled through and through. She could have caught at his arm\nfor support, in the awful dizziness which wrapped her up, body and\nsoul. That voice! No! if name, and face, and figure were all changed,\nthat voice was the same which had touched her girlish heart, which\nhad spoken most tender words of love, which had won, and wrecked her,\nand which she had last heard in the low mutterings of fever. She\ndared not look round to see the figure of him who spoke, dark as it\nwas. She knew he was there--she heard him speak in the manner in\nwhich he used to address strangers years ago; perhaps she answered\nhim, perhaps she did not--God knew. It seemed as if weights were tied\nto her feet--as if the steadfast rocks receded--as if time stood\nstill;--it was so long, so terrible, that path across the reeling\nsand.\n\nAt the foot of the rocks they separated. Mr Bradshaw, afraid lest\ndinner should cool, preferred the shorter way for himself and his\nfriends. On Elizabeth's account, the girls were to take the longer\nand easier path, which wound upwards through a rocky field, where\nlarks' nests abounded, and where wild thyme and heather were now\nthrowing out their sweets to the soft night air.\n\nThe little girls spoke in eager discussion of the strangers. They\nappealed to Ruth, but Ruth did not answer, and they were too\nimpatient to convince each other to repeat the question. The first\nlittle ascent from the sands to the field surmounted, Ruth sat\ndown suddenly and covered her face with her hands. This was so\nunusual--their wishes, their good, was so invariably the rule of\nmotion or of rest in their walks--that the girls, suddenly checked,\nstood silent and affrighted in surprise. They were still more\nstartled when Ruth wailed aloud some inarticulate words.\n\n\"Are you not well, dear Mrs Denbigh?\" asked Elizabeth, gently,\nkneeling down on the grass by Ruth.\n\nShe sat facing the west. The low watery twilight was on her face as\nshe took her hands away. So pale, so haggard, so wild and wandering a\nlook the girls had never seen on human countenance before.\n\n\"Well! what are you doing here with me? You should not be with me,\"\nsaid she, shaking her head slowly.\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n\"You are sadly tired,\" said Elizabeth, soothingly. \"Come home, and\nlet me help you to bed. I will tell papa you are ill, and ask him to\nsend for a doctor.\"\n\nRuth looked at her as if she did not understand the meaning of her\nwords. No more she did at first. But by-and-by the dulled brain began\nto think most vividly and rapidly, and she spoke in a sharp way which\ndeceived the girls into a belief that nothing had been the matter.\n\n\"Yes! I was tired. I am tired. Those sands--oh! those sands, those\nweary, dreadful sands! But that is all over now. Only my heart aches\nstill. Feel how it flutters and beats,\" said she, taking Elizabeth's\nhand, and holding it to her side. \"I am quite well, though,\" she\ncontinued, reading pity in the child's looks, as she felt the\ntrembling, quivering beat. \"We will go straight to the dressing-room,\nand read a chapter; that will still my heart; and then I'll go to\nbed, and Mr Bradshaw will excuse me, I know, this one night. I only\nask for one night. Put on your right frocks, dears, and do all you\nought to do. But I know you will,\" said she, bending down to kiss\nElizabeth, and then, before she had done so, raising her head\nabruptly. \"You are good and dear girls--God keep you so!\"\n\nBy a strong effort at self-command, she went onwards at an even pace,\nneither rushing nor pausing to sob and think. The very regularity of\nmotion calmed her. The front and back doors of the house were on two\nsides, at right angles with each other. They all shrunk a little\nfrom the idea of going in at the front door, now that the strange\ngentlemen were about, and, accordingly, they went through the quiet\nfarm-yard right into the bright, ruddy kitchen, where the servants\nwere dashing about with the dinner things. It was a contrast in\nmore than colour to the lonely, dusky field, which even the little\ngirls perceived; and the noise, the warmth, the very bustle of the\nservants, were a positive relief to Ruth, and for the time lifted\noff the heavy press of pent-up passion. A silent house, with moonlit\nrooms, or with a faint gloom brooding over the apartments, would have\nbeen more to be dreaded. Then, she must have given way, and cried\nout. As it was, she went up the old awkward back stairs, and into the\nroom they were to sit in. There was no candle. Mary volunteered to go\ndown for one; and when she returned she was full of the wonders of\npreparation in the drawing-room, and ready and eager to dress, so as\nto take her place there before the gentlemen had finished dinner. But\nshe was struck by the strange paleness of Ruth's face, now that the\nlight fell upon it.\n\n\"Stay up here, dear Mrs Denbigh! We'll tell papa you are tired, and\nare gone to bed.\"\n\nAnother time Ruth would have dreaded Mr Bradshaw's displeasure; for\nit was an understood thing that no one was to be ill or tired in his\nhousehold without leave asked, and cause given and assigned. But\nshe never thought of that now. Her great desire was to hold quiet\ntill she was alone. Quietness it was not--it was rigidity; but she\nsucceeded in being rigid in look and movement, and went through her\nduties to Elizabeth (who preferred remaining with her upstairs) with\nwooden precision. But her heart felt at times like ice, at times\nlike burning fire; always a heavy, heavy weight within her. At last\nElizabeth went to bed. Still Ruth dared not think. Mary would come\nupstairs soon; and with a strange, sick, shrinking yearning, Ruth\nawaited her--and the crumbs of intelligence she might drop out about\n_him_. Ruth's sense of hearing was quickened to miserable intensity\nas she stood before the chimney-piece, grasping it tight with both\nhands--gazing into the dying fire, but seeing--not the dead grey\nembers, or the little sparks of vivid light that ran hither and\nthither among the wood-ashes--but an old farm-house, and climbing,\nwinding road, and a little golden breezy common, with a rural inn on\nthe hill-top, far, far away. And through the thoughts of the past\ncame the sharp sounds of the present--of three voices, one of which\nwas almost silence, it was so hushed. Indifferent people would only\nhave guessed that Mr Donne was speaking by the quietness in which\nthe others listened; but Ruth heard the voice and many of the words,\nthough they conveyed no idea to her mind. She was too much stunned\neven to feel curious to know to what they related. _He_ spoke. That\nwas her one fact.\n\nPresently up came Mary, bounding, exultant. Papa had let her stay\nup one quarter of an hour longer, because Mr Hickson had asked. Mr\nHickson was so clever! She did not know what to make of Mr Donne,\nhe seemed such a dawdle. But he was very handsome. Had Ruth seen\nhim? Oh, no! She could not, it was so dark on those stupid sands.\nWell, never mind, she would see him to-morrow. She _must_ be well\nto-morrow. Papa seemed a good deal put out that neither she nor\nElizabeth were in the drawing-room to-night; and his last words were,\n\"Tell Mrs Denbigh I hope\" (and papa's \"hopes\" always meant \"expect\")\n\"she will be able to make breakfast at nine o'clock;\" and then she\nwould see Mr Donne.\n\nThat was all Ruth heard about him. She went with Mary into her\nbedroom, helped her to undress, and put the candle out. At length she\nwas alone in her own room! At length!\n\nBut the tension did not give way immediately. She fastened her door,\nand threw open the window, cold and threatening as was the night. She\ntore off her gown; she put her hair back from her heated face. It\nseemed now as if she could not think--as if thought and emotion had\nbeen repressed so sternly that they would not come to relieve her\nstupified brain. Till all at once, like a flash of lightning, her\nlife, past and present, was revealed to her in its minutest detail.\nAnd when she saw her very present \"Now,\" the strange confusion of\nagony was too great to be borne, and she cried aloud. Then she was\nquite dead, and listened as to the sound of galloping armies.\n\n\"If I might see him! If I might see him! If I might just ask him why\nhe left me; if I had vexed him in any way; it was so strange--so\ncruel! It was not him; it was his mother,\" said she, almost fiercely,\nas if answering herself. \"Oh, God! but he might have found me out\nbefore this,\" she continued, sadly. \"He did not care for me, as I\ndid for him. He did not care for me at all,\" she went on wildly and\nsharply. \"He did me cruel harm. I can never again lift up my face in\ninnocence. They think I have forgotten all, because I do not speak.\nOh, darling love! am I talking against you?\" asked she, tenderly. \"I\nam so torn and perplexed! You, who are the father of my child!\"\n\nBut that very circumstance, full of such tender meaning in many\ncases, threw a new light into her mind. It changed her from the woman\ninto the mother--the stern guardian of her child. She was still for a\ntime, thinking. Then she began again, but in a low, deep voice,\n\n\"He left me. He might have been hurried off, but he might have\ninquired--he might have learnt, and explained. He left me to bear\nthe burden and the shame; and never cared to learn, as he might have\ndone, of Leonard's birth. He has no love for his child, and I will\nhave no love for him.\"\n\nShe raised her voice while uttering this determination, and then,\nfeeling her own weakness, she moaned out, \"Alas! alas!\"\n\nAnd then she started up, for all this time she had been rocking\nherself backwards and forwards as she sat on the ground, and began to\npace the room with hurried steps.\n\n\"What am I thinking of? Where am I? I who have been praying these\nyears and years to be worthy to be Leonard's mother. My God! what a\ndepth of sin is in my heart! Why, the old time would be as white as\nsnow to what it would be now, if I sought him out, and prayed for the\nexplanation, which should re-establish him in my heart. I who have\nstriven (or made a mock of trying) to learn God's holy will, in order\nto bring up Leonard into the full strength of a Christian--I who have\ntaught his sweet innocent lips to pray, 'Lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from evil;' and yet, somehow, I've been longing to\ngive him to his father, who is--who is--\" she almost choked, till\nat last she cried sharp out, \"Oh, my God! I do believe Leonard's\nfather is a bad man, and yet, oh! pitiful God, I love him; I cannot\nforget--I cannot!\"\n\nShe threw her body half out of the window into the cold night air.\nThe wind was rising, and came in great gusts. The rain beat down on\nher. It did her good. A still, calm night would not have soothed her\nas this did. The wild tattered clouds, hurrying past the moon, gave\nher a foolish kind of pleasure that almost made her smile a vacant\nsmile. The blast-driven rain came on her again, and drenched her hair\nthrough and through. The words \"stormy wind fulfilling His word\" came\ninto her mind.\n\nShe sat down on the floor. This time her hands were clasped round her\nknees. The uneasy rocking motion was stilled.\n\n\"I wonder if my darling is frightened with this blustering, noisy\nwind. I wonder if he is awake.\"\n\nAnd then her thoughts went back to the various times of old, when,\naffrighted by the weather--sounds so mysterious in the night--he had\ncrept into her bed and clung to her, and she had soothed him, and\nsweetly awed him into stillness and childlike faith, by telling him\nof the goodness and power of God.\n\nOf a sudden she crept to a chair, and there knelt as in the very\npresence of God, hiding her face, at first not speaking a word (for\ndid He not know her heart), but by-and-by moaning out, amid her sobs\nand tears (and now for the first time she wept),\n\n\"Oh, my God, help me, for I am very weak. My God! I pray Thee be my\nrock and my strong fortress, for I of myself am nothing. If I ask in\nHis name, Thou wilt give it me. In the name of Jesus Christ I pray\nfor strength to do Thy will!\"\n\nShe could not think, or, indeed, remember anything but that she\nwas weak, and God was strong, and \"a very present help in time of\ntrouble;\" and the wind rose yet higher, and the house shook and\nvibrated as, in measured time, the great and terrible gusts came from\nthe four quarters of the heavens and blew around it, dying away in\nthe distance with loud and unearthly wails, which were not utterly\nstill before the sound of the coming blast was heard like the\ntrumpets of the vanguard of the Prince of Air.\n\nThere was a knock at the bedroom door--a little, gentle knock, and a\nsoft child's voice.\n\n\"Mrs Denbigh, may I come in, please? I am so frightened!\"\n\nIt was Elizabeth. Ruth calmed her passionate breathing by one hasty\ndraught of water, and opened the door to the timid girl.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs Denbigh! did you ever hear such a night? I am so frightened!\nand Mary sleeps so sound.\"\n\nRuth was too much shaken to be able to speak all at once; but she\ntook Elizabeth in her arms to reassure her. Elizabeth stood back.\n\n\"Why, how wet you are, Mrs Denbigh! and there's the window open, I do\nbelieve! Oh, how cold it is!\" said she, shivering.\n\n\"Get into my bed, dear!\" said Ruth.\n\n\"But do come too! The candle gives such a strange light with that\nlong wick, and, somehow, your face does not look like you. Please,\nput the candle out, and come to bed. I am so frightened, and it seems\nas if I should be safer if you were by me.\"\n\nRuth shut the window, and went to bed. Elizabeth was all shivering\nand quaking. To soothe her, Ruth made a great effort; and spoke of\nLeonard and his fears, and, in a low hesitating voice, she spoke of\nGod's tender mercy, but very humbly, for she feared lest Elizabeth\nshould think her better and holier than she was. The little girl was\nsoon asleep, her fears forgotten; and Ruth, worn out by passionate\nemotion, and obliged to be still for fear of awaking her bedfellow,\nwent off into a short slumber, through the depths of which the echoes\nof her waking sobs quivered up.\n\nWhen she awoke the grey light of autumnal dawn was in the room.\nElizabeth slept on; but Ruth heard the servants about, and the\nearly farmyard sounds. After she had recovered from the shock of\nconsciousness and recollection, she collected her thoughts with a\nstern calmness. He was here. In a few hours she must meet him. There\nwas no escape, except through subterfuges and contrivances that were\nboth false and cowardly. How it would all turn out she could not say,\nor even guess. But of one thing she was clear, and to one thing she\nwould hold fast: that was, that, come what might, she would obey\nGod's law, and, be the end of all what it might, she would say, \"Thy\nwill be done!\" She only asked for strength enough to do this when\nthe time came. How the time would come--what speech or action would\nbe requisite on her part, she did not know--she did not even try to\nconjecture. She left that in His hands.\n\nShe was icy cold, but very calm, when the breakfast-bell rang. She\nwent down immediately; because she felt that there was less chance\nof a recognition if she were already at her place beside the tea-urn,\nand busied with the cups, than if she came in after all were settled.\nHer heart seemed to stand still, but she felt almost a strange\nexultant sense of power over herself. She felt, rather than saw,\nthat he was not there. Mr Bradshaw and Mr Hickson were, and so\nbusy talking election-politics that they did not interrupt their\nconversation even when they bowed to her. Her pupils sat one on each\nside of her. Before they were quite settled, and while the other two\ngentlemen yet hung over the fire, Mr Donne came in. Ruth felt as if\nthat moment was like death. She had a kind of desire to make some\nsharp sound, to relieve a choking sensation, but it was over in an\ninstant, and she sat on very composed and silent--to all outward\nappearance the very model of a governess who knew her place. And\nby-and-by she felt strangely at ease in her sense of power. She could\neven listen to what was being said. She had never dared as yet to\nlook at Mr Donne, though her heart burnt to see him once again. He\nsounded changed. The voice had lost its fresh and youthful eagerness\nof tone, though in peculiarity of modulation it was the same. It\ncould never be mistaken for the voice of another person. There was a\ngood deal said at that breakfast, for none seemed inclined to hurry,\nalthough it was Sunday morning. Ruth was compelled to sit there, and\nit was good for her that she did. That half-hour seemed to separate\nthe present Mr Donne very effectively from her imagination of what Mr\nBellingham had been. She was no analyser; she hardly even had learnt\nto notice character; but she felt there was some strange difference\nbetween the people she had lived with lately and the man who now\nleant back in his chair, listening in a careless manner to the\nconversation, but never joining in, or expressing any interest in it,\nunless it somewhere, or somehow, touched himself. Now, Mr Bradshaw\nalways threw himself into a subject; it might be in a pompous,\ndogmatic sort of way, but he did do it, whether it related to himself\nor not; and it was part of Mr Hickson's trade to assume an interest\nif he felt it not. But Mr Donne did neither the one nor the other.\nWhen the other two were talking of many of the topics of the day, he\nput his glass in his eye, the better to examine into the exact nature\nof a cold game-pie at the other side of the table. Suddenly Ruth\nfelt that his attention was caught by her. Until now, seeing his\nshort-sightedness, she had believed herself safe; now her face\nflushed with a painful, miserable blush. But in an instant she was\nstrong and quiet. She looked up straight at his face; and, as if this\naction took him aback, he dropped his glass, and began eating away\nwith great diligence. She had seen him. He was changed, she knew\nnot how. In fact, the expression, which had been only occasional\nformerly, when his worse self predominated, had become permanent. He\nlooked restless and dissatisfied. But he was very handsome still;\nand her quick eye had recognised, with a sort of strange pride, that\nthe eyes and mouth were like Leonard's. Although perplexed by the\nstraightforward, brave look she had sent right at him, he was not\nentirely baffled. He thought this Mrs Denbigh was certainly like\npoor Ruth; but this woman was far handsomer. Her face was positively\nGreek; and then such a proud, superb turn of her head; quite queenly!\nA governess in Mr Bradshaw's family! Why, she might be a Percy or\na Howard for the grandeur of her grace! Poor Ruth! This woman's\nhair was darker, though; and she had less colour; altogether a more\nrefined-looking person. Poor Ruth! and, for the first time for\nseveral years, he wondered what had become of her; though, of course,\nthere was but one thing that could have happened, and perhaps it was\nas well he did not know her end, for most likely it would have made\nhim very uncomfortable. He leant back in his chair, and, unobserved\n(for he would not have thought it gentlemanly to look so fixedly at\nher if she or any one noticed him), he put up his glass again. She\nwas speaking to one of her pupils, and did not see him.\n\nBy Jove! it must be she, though! There were little dimples came out\nabout the mouth as she spoke, just like those he used to admire\nso much in Ruth, and which he had never seen in any one else--the\nsunshine without the positive movement of a smile. The longer he\nlooked the more he was convinced; and it was with a jerk that he\nrecovered himself enough to answer Mr Bradshaw's question, whether he\nwished to go to church or not.\n\n\"Church? how far--a mile? No; I think I shall perform my devotions at\nhome to-day.\"\n\nHe absolutely felt jealous when Mr Hickson sprang up to open the door\nas Ruth and her pupils left the room. He was pleased to feel jealous\nagain. He had been really afraid he was too much \"used-up\" for such\nsensations. But Hickson must keep his place. What he was paid for was\ndoing the talking to the electors, not paying attention to the ladies\nin their families. Mr Donne had noticed that Mr Hickson had tried to\nbe gallant to Miss Bradshaw; let him, if he liked; but let him beware\nhow he behaved to this fair creature, Ruth or no Ruth. It certainly\nwas Ruth; only how the devil had she played her cards so well as to\nbe the governess--the respected governess, in such a family as Mr\nBradshaw's?\n\nMr Donne's movements were evidently to be the guide of Mr Hickson's.\nMr Bradshaw always disliked going to church, partly from principle,\npartly because he never could find the places in the Prayer-book. Mr\nDonne was in the drawing-room as Mary came down ready equipped; he\nwas turning over the leaves of the large and handsome Bible. Seeing\nMary, he was struck with a new idea.\n\n\"How singular it is,\" said he, \"that the name of Ruth is so seldom\nchosen by those good people who go to the Bible before they christen\ntheir children. It is a pretty name, I think.\"\n\nMr Bradshaw looked up. \"Why, Mary!\" said he, \"is not that Mrs\nDenbigh's name?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa,\" replied Mary, eagerly; \"and I know two other Ruths;\nthere's Ruth Brown here, and Ruth Macartney at Eccleston.\"\n\n\"And I have an aunt called Ruth, Mr Donne! I don't think your\nobservation holds good. Besides my daughters' governess, I know three\nother Ruths.\"\n\n\"Oh! I have no doubt I was wrong. It was just a speech of which one\nperceives the folly the moment it is made.\"\n\nBut, secretly, he rejoiced with a fierce joy over the success of his\ndevice.\n\nElizabeth came to summon Mary.\n\nRuth was glad when she got into the open air, and away from the\nhouse. Two hours were gone and over. Two out of a day, a day and a\nhalf--for it might be late on Monday morning before the Eccleston\nparty returned.\n\nShe felt weak and trembling in body, but strong in power over\nherself. They had left the house in good time for church, so they\nneeded not to hurry; and they went leisurely along the road, now and\nthen passing some country person whom they knew, and with whom they\nexchanged a kindly, placid greeting. But presently, to Ruth's dismay,\nshe heard a step behind, coming at a rapid pace, a peculiar clank\nof rather high-heeled boots, which gave a springy sound to the walk,\nthat she had known well long ago. It was like a nightmare, where the\nEvil dreaded is never avoided, never completely shunned, but is by\none's side at the very moment of triumph in escape. There he was by\nher side; and there was a quarter of a mile intervening between her\nand the church; but even yet she trusted that he had not recognised\nher.\n\n\"I have changed my mind, you see,\" said he, quietly. \"I have some\ncuriosity to see the architecture of the church; some of these old\ncountry churches have singular bits about them. Mr Bradshaw kindly\ndirected me part of the way, but I was so much puzzled by 'turns to\nthe right,' and 'turns to the left,' that I was quite glad to espy\nyour party.\"\n\nThat speech required no positive answer of any kind; and no answer\ndid it receive. He had not expected a reply. He knew, if she were\nRuth, she could not answer any indifferent words of his; and her\nsilence made him more certain of her identity with the lady by his\nside.\n\n\"The scenery here is of a kind new to me; neither grand, wild, nor\nyet marked by high cultivation; and yet it has great charms. It\nreminds me of some parts of Wales.\" He breathed deeply, and then\nadded, \"You have been in Wales, I believe?\"\n\nHe spoke low; almost in a whisper. The little church-bell began to\ncall the lagging people with its quick, sharp summons. Ruth writhed\nin body and spirit, but struggled on. The church-door would be gained\nat last; and in that holy place she would find peace.\n\nHe repeated in a louder tone, so as to compel an answer in order to\nconceal her agitation from the girls:\n\n\"Have you never been in Wales?\" He used \"never\" instead of \"ever,\"\nand laid the emphasis on that word, in order to mark his meaning to\nRuth, and Ruth only. But he drove her to bay.\n\n\"I have been in Wales, sir,\" she replied, in a calm, grave tone. \"I\nwas there many years ago. Events took place there, which contribute\nto make the recollection of that time most miserable to me. I shall\nbe obliged to you, sir, if you will make no further reference to it.\"\n\nThe little girls wondered how Mrs Denbigh could speak in such a\ntone of quiet authority to Mr Donne, who was almost a member of\nParliament. But they settled that her husband must have died in\nWales, and, of course, that would make the recollection of the\ncountry \"most miserable,\" as she said.\n\nMr Donne did not dislike the answer, and he positively admired the\ndignity with which she spoke. His leaving her as he did must have\nmade her very miserable; and he liked the pride that made her retain\nher indignation, until he could speak to her in private, and explain\naway a good deal of what she might complain of with some justice.\n\nThe church was reached. They all went up the middle aisle into the\nEagle's Crag pew. He followed them in, entered himself, and shut the\ndoor. Ruth's heart sank as she saw him there; just opposite to her;\ncoming between her and the clergyman who was to read out the Word of\nGod. It was merciless--it was cruel to haunt her there. She durst\nnot lift her eyes to the bright eastern light--she could not see how\npeacefully the marble images of the dead lay on their tombs, for he\nwas between her and all Light and Peace. She knew that his look was\non her; that he never turned his glance away. She could not join in\nthe prayer for the remission of sins while he was there, for his very\npresence seemed as a sign that their stain would never be washed out\nof her life. But, although goaded and chafed by her thoughts and\nrecollections, she kept very still. No sign of emotion, no flush of\ncolour was on her face as he looked at her. Elizabeth could not find\nher place, and then Ruth breathed once, long and deeply, as she moved\nup the pew, and out of the straight, burning glance of those eyes of\nevil meaning. When they sat down for the reading of the first lesson,\nRuth turned the corner of the seat so as no longer to be opposite to\nhim. She could not listen. The words seemed to be uttered in some\nworld far away, from which she was exiled and cast out; their sound,\nand yet more their meaning, was dim and distant. But in this extreme\ntension of mind to hold in her bewildered agony, it so happened that\none of her senses was preternaturally acute. While all the church\nand the people swam in misty haze, one point in a dark corner grew\nclearer and clearer till she saw (what at another time she could not\nhave discerned at all) a face--a gargoyle I think they call it--at\nthe end of the arch next to the narrowing of the nave into the\nchancel, and in the shadow of that contraction. The face was\nbeautiful in feature (the next to it was a grinning monkey), but it\nwas not the features that were the most striking part. There was a\nhalf-open mouth, not in any way distorted out of its exquisite beauty\nby the intense expression of suffering it conveyed. Any distortion of\nthe face by mental agony implies that a struggle with circumstance is\ngoing on. But in this face, if such struggle had been, it was over\nnow. Circumstance had conquered; and there was no hope from mortal\nendeavour, or help from mortal creature to be had. But the eyes\nlooked onward and upward to the \"Hills from whence cometh our help.\"\nAnd though the parted lips seemed ready to quiver with agony, yet\nthe expression of the whole face, owing to these strange, stony,\nand yet spiritual eyes, was high and consoling. If mortal gaze had\nnever sought its meaning before, in the deep shadow where it had\nbeen placed long centuries ago, yet Ruth's did now. Who could have\nimagined such a look? Who could have witnessed--perhaps felt--such\ninfinite sorrow, and yet dared to lift it up by Faith into a peace\nso pure? Or was it a mere conception? If so, what a soul the unknown\ncarver must have had! for creator and handicraftsman must have been\none; no two minds could have been in such perfect harmony. Whatever\nit was--however it came there--imaginer, carver, sufferer, all\nwere long passed away. Human art was ended--human life done--human\nsuffering over; but this remained; it stilled Ruth's beating heart\nto look on it. She grew still enough to hear words which have come\nto many in their time of need, and awed them in the presence of the\nextremest suffering that the hushed world has ever heard of.\n\nThe second lesson for the morning of the 25th of September is the\n26th chapter of St Matthew's Gospel.\n\nAnd when they prayed again, Ruth's tongue was unloosed, and she also\ncould pray, in His name, who underwent the agony in the garden.\n\nAs they came out of church, there was a little pause and gathering at\nthe door. It had begun to rain; those who had umbrellas were putting\nthem up; those who had not were regretting, and wondering how long\nit would last. Standing for a moment, impeded by the people who were\nthus collected under the porch, Ruth heard a voice close to her say,\nvery low, but very distinctly,\n\n\"I have much to say to you--much to explain. I entreat you to give me\nthe opportunity.\"\n\nRuth did not reply. She would not acknowledge that she heard; but\nshe trembled nevertheless, for the well-remembered voice was low and\nsoft, and had yet its power to thrill. She earnestly desired to know\nwhy and how he had left her. It appeared to her as if that knowledge\ncould alone give her a relief from the restless wondering that\ndistracted her mind, and that one explanation could do no harm.\n\n\"_No!_\" the higher spirit made answer; \"_it must not be._\"\n\nRuth and the girls had each an umbrella. She turned to Mary, and\nsaid,\n\n\"Mary, give your umbrella to Mr Donne, and come under mine.\" Her way\nof speaking was short and decided; she was compressing her meaning\ninto as few words as possible. The little girl obeyed in silence. As\nthey went first through the churchyard stile, Mr Donne spoke again.\n\n\"You are unforgiving,\" said he. \"I only ask you to hear me. I have a\nright to be heard, Ruth! I won't believe you are so much changed, as\nnot to listen to me when I entreat.\"\n\nHe spoke in a tone of soft complaint. But he himself had done much\nto destroy the illusion which had hung about his memory for years,\nwhenever Ruth had allowed herself to think of it. Besides which,\nduring the time of her residence in the Benson family, her feeling of\nwhat people ought to be had been unconsciously raised and refined;\nand Mr Donne, even while she had to struggle against the force of\npast recollections, repelled her so much by what he was at present,\nthat every speech of his, every minute they were together, served\nto make her path more and more easy to follow. His voice retained\nsomething of its former influence. When he spoke, without her seeing\nhim, she could not help remembering former days.\n\nShe did not answer this last speech any more than the first. She\nsaw clearly, that, putting aside all thought as to the character of\ntheir former relationship, it had been dissolved by his will--his\nact and deed; and that, therefore, the power to refuse any further\nintercourse whatsoever remained with her.\n\nIt sometimes seems a little strange how, after having earnestly\nprayed to be delivered from temptation, and having given ourselves\nwith shut eyes into God's hand, from that time every thought, every\noutward influence, every acknowledged law of life, seems to lead us\non from strength to strength. It seems strange sometimes, because\nwe notice the coincidence; but it is the natural, unavoidable\nconsequence of all truth and goodness being one and the same, and\ntherefore carried out in every circumstance, external and internal,\nof God's creation.\n\nWhen Mr Donne saw that Ruth would not answer him, he became only the\nmore determined that she should hear what he had to say. What that\nwas he did not exactly know. The whole affair was most mysterious and\npiquant.\n\nThe umbrella protected Ruth from more than the rain on that walk\nhomewards, for under its shelter she could not be spoken to unheard.\nShe had not rightly understood at what time she and the girls were to\ndine. From the gathering at meal-times she must not shrink. She must\nshow no sign of weakness. But, oh! the relief, after that walk, to\nsit in her own room, locked up, so that neither Mary nor Elizabeth\ncould come by surprise, and to let her weary frame (weary with being\nso long braced up to rigidity and stiff quiet) fall into a chair\nanyhow--all helpless, nerveless, motionless, as if the very bones had\nmelted out of her!\n\nThe peaceful rest which her mind took was in thinking of Leonard.\nShe dared not look before or behind, but she could see him well\nat present. She brooded over the thought of him, till she dreaded\nhis father more and more. By the light of her child's purity and\ninnocence, she saw evil clearly, and yet more clearly. She thought\nthat, if Leonard ever came to know the nature of his birth, she\nhad nothing for it but to die out of his sight. He could never\nknow--human heart could never know, her ignorant innocence, and all\nthe small circumstances which had impelled her onwards. But God knew.\nAnd if Leonard heard of his mother's error, why, nothing remained\nbut death; for she felt, then, as if she had it in her power to die\ninnocently out of such future agony; but that escape is not so easy.\nSuddenly a fresh thought came, and she prayed that, through whatever\nsuffering, she might be purified. Whatever trials, woes, measureless\npangs, God might see fit to chastise her with, she would not shrink,\nif only at last she might come into His presence in Heaven. Alas!\nthe shrinking from suffering we cannot help. That part of her prayer\nwas vain. And as for the rest, was not the sure justice of His law\nfinding her out even now? His laws once broken, His justice and the\nvery nature of those laws bring the immutable retribution; but if we\nturn penitently to Him, He enables us to bear our punishment with a\nmeek and docile heart, \"for His mercy endureth for ever.\"\n\nMr Bradshaw had felt himself rather wanting in proper attention\nto his guest, inasmuch as he had been unable, all in a minute, to\ncomprehend Mr Donne's rapid change of purpose; and, before it had\nentered into his mind that, notwithstanding the distance of the\nchurch, Mr Donne was going thither, that gentleman was out of the\nsight, and far out of the reach, of his burly host. But though the\nlatter had so far neglected the duties of hospitality as to allow\nhis visitor to sit in the Eagle's Crag pew with no other guard of\nhonour than the children and the governess, Mr Bradshaw determined\nto make up for it by extra attention during the remainder of the day.\nAccordingly he never left Mr Donne. Whatever wish that gentleman\nexpressed, it was the study of his host to gratify. Did he hint at\nthe pleasure which a walk in such beautiful scenery would give him,\nMr Bradshaw was willing to accompany him, although at Eccleston it\nwas a principle with him not to take any walks for pleasure on a\nSunday. When Mr Donne turned round, and recollected letters which\nmust be written, and which would compel him to stay at home, Mr\nBradshaw instantly gave up the walk, and remained at hand, ready to\nfurnish him with any writing-materials which could be wanted, and\nwhich were not laid out in the half-furnished house. Nobody knew\nwhere Mr Hickson was all this time. He had sauntered out after Mr\nDonne, when the latter set off for church, and he had never returned.\nMr Donne kept wondering if he could have met Ruth--if, in fact, she\nhad gone out with her pupils, now that the afternoon had cleared\nup. This uneasy wonder, and a few mental imprecations on his host's\npolite attention, together with the letter-writing pretence, passed\naway the afternoon--the longest afternoon he had ever spent; and\nof weariness he had had his share. Lunch was lingering in the\ndining-room, left there for the truant Mr Hickson; but of the\nchildren or Ruth there was no sign. He ventured on a distant inquiry\nas to their whereabouts.\n\n\"They dine early; they are gone to church again. Mrs Denbigh was a\nmember of the Establishment once; and, though she attends chapel at\nhome, she seems glad to have an opportunity of going to church.\"\n\nMr Donne was on the point of asking some further questions about \"Mrs\nDenbigh,\" when Mr Hickson came in, loud-spoken, cheerful, hungry, and\nas ready to talk about his ramble, and the way in which he had lost\nand found himself, as he was about everything else. He knew how to\ndress up the commonest occurrence with a little exaggeration, a few\npuns, and a happy quotation or two, so as to make it sound very\nagreeable. He could read faces, and saw that he had been missed;\nboth host and visitor looked moped to death. He determined to devote\nhimself to their amusement during the remainder of the day, for he\nhad really lost himself, and felt that he had been away too long on a\ndull Sunday, when people were apt to get hypped if not well amused.\n\n\"It is really a shame to be indoors in such a place. Rain? yes, it\nrained some hours ago, but now it is splendid weather. I feel myself\nquite qualified for guide, I assure you. I can show you all the\nbeauties of the neighbourhood, and throw in a bog and a nest of\nvipers to boot.\"\n\nMr Donne languidly assented to this proposal of going out; and then\nhe became restless until Mr Hickson had eaten a hasty lunch, for he\nhoped to meet Ruth on the way from church, to be near her, and watch\nher, though he might not be able to speak to her. To have the slow\nhours roll away--to know he must leave the next day--and yet, so\nclose to her, not to be seeing her--was more than he could bear. In\nan impetuous kind of way, he disregarded all Mr Hickson's offers of\nguidance to lovely views, and turned a deaf ear to Mr Bradshaw's\nexpressed wish of showing him the land belonging to the house (\"very\nlittle for fourteen thousand pounds\"), and set off wilfully on the\nroad leading to the church, from which, he averred, he had seen a\nview which nothing else about the place could equal.\n\nThey met the country people dropping homewards. No Ruth was there.\nShe and her pupils had returned by the field-way, as Mr Bradshaw\ninformed his guests at dinner-time. Mr Donne was very captious\nall through dinner. He thought it would never be over, and cursed\nHickson's interminable stories, which were told on purpose to\namuse him. His heart gave a fierce bound when he saw her in the\ndrawing-room with the little girls.\n\nShe was reading to them--with how sick and trembling a heart, no\nwords can tell. But she could master and keep down outward signs of\nher emotion. An hour more to-night (part of which was to be spent in\nfamily prayer, and all in the safety of company), another hour in the\nmorning (when all would be engaged in the bustle of departure)--if,\nduring this short space of time, she could not avoid speaking to him,\nshe could at least keep him at such a distance as to make him feel\nthat henceforward her world and his belonged to separate systems,\nwide as the heavens apart.\n\nBy degrees she felt that he was drawing near to where she stood.\nHe was by the table examining the books that lay upon it. Mary and\nElizabeth drew off a little space, awe-stricken by the future member\nfor Eccleston. As he bent his head over a book, he said, \"I implore\nyou; five minutes alone.\"\n\nThe little girls could not hear; but Ruth, hemmed in so that no\nescape was possible, did hear.\n\nShe took sudden courage, and said, in a clear voice,\n\n\"Will you read the whole passage aloud? I do not remember it.\"\n\nMr Hickson, hovering at no great distance, heard these words, and\ndrew near to second Mrs Denbigh's request. Mr Bradshaw, who was very\nsleepy after his unusually late dinner, and longing for bedtime,\njoined in the request, for it would save the necessity for making\ntalk, and he might, perhaps, get in a nap, undisturbed and unnoticed,\nbefore the servants came in to prayers.\n\nMr Donne was caught; he was obliged to read aloud, although he did\nnot know what he was reading. In the middle of some sentence the\ndoor opened, a rush of servants came in, and Mr Bradshaw became\nparticularly wide awake in an instant, and read them a long sermon\nwith great emphasis and unction, winding up with a prayer almost as\nlong.\n\nRuth sat with her head drooping, more from exhaustion after a season\nof effort than because she shunned Mr Donne's looks. He had so lost\nhis power over her--his power, which had stirred her so deeply the\nnight before--that, except as one knowing her error and her shame,\nand making a cruel use of such knowledge, she had quite separated him\nfrom the idol of her youth. And yet, for the sake of that first and\nonly love, she would gladly have known what explanation he could\noffer to account for leaving her. It would have been something gained\nto her own self-respect, if she had learnt that he was not then, as\nshe felt him to be now, cold and egotistical, caring for no one and\nnothing but what related to himself.\n\nHome, and Leonard--how strangely peaceful the two seemed! Oh, for the\nrest that a dream about Leonard would bring!\n\nMary and Elizabeth went to bed immediately after prayers, and Ruth\naccompanied them. It was planned that the gentlemen should leave\nearly the next morning. They were to breakfast half an hour sooner,\nto catch the railway train; and this by Mr Donne's own arrangement,\nwho had been as eager about his canvassing, the week before, as it\nwas possible for him to be, but who now wished Eccleston and the\nDissenting interest therein very fervently at the devil.\n\nJust as the carriage came round, Mr Bradshaw turned to Ruth: \"Any\nmessage for Leonard beyond love, which is a matter of course?\"\n\nRuth gasped--for she saw Mr Donne catch at the name; she did not\nguess the sudden sharp jealousy called out by the idea that Leonard\nwas a grown-up man.\n\n\"Who is Leonard?\" said he to the little girl standing by him; he did\nnot know which she was.\n\n\"Mrs Denbigh's little boy,\" answered Mary.\n\nUnder some pretence or other, he drew near to Ruth; and in that low\nvoice, which she had learnt to loathe, he said,\n\n\"Our child!\"\n\nBy the white misery that turned her face to stone--by the wild terror\nin her imploring eyes--by the gasping breath which came out as the\ncarriage drove away--he knew that he had seized the spell to make her\nlisten at last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nThe Meeting on the Sands\n\n\n\"He will take him away from me! He will take the child from me!\"\n\nThese words rang like a tolling bell through Ruth's head. It seemed\nto her that her doom was certain. Leonard would be taken from her!\nShe had a firm conviction--not the less firm because she knew not on\nwhat it was based--that a child, whether legitimate or not, belonged\nof legal right to the father. And Leonard, of all children, was the\nprince and monarch. Every man's heart would long to call Leonard\n\"Child!\" She had been too strongly taxed to have much power left\nher to reason coolly and dispassionately, just then, even if she had\nbeen with any one who could furnish her with information from which\nto draw correct conclusions. The one thought haunted her night and\nday--\"He will take my child away from me!\" In her dreams she saw\nLeonard borne away into some dim land, to which she could not follow.\nSometimes he sat in a swiftly-moving carriage, at his father's side,\nand smiled on her as he passed by, as if going to promised pleasure.\nAt another time he was struggling to return to her; stretching out\nhis little arms, and crying to her for the help she could not give.\nHow she got through the days, she did not know; her body moved about\nand habitually acted, but her spirit was with her child. She thought\noften of writing and warning Mr Benson of Leonard's danger; but then\nshe shrank from recurring to circumstances, all mention of which had\nceased years ago; the very recollection of which seemed buried deep\nfor ever. Besides, she feared occasioning discord or commotion in the\nquiet circle in which she lived. Mr Benson's deep anger against her\nbetrayer had been shown too clearly in the old time to allow her to\nthink that he would keep it down without expression now. He would\ncease to do anything to forward his election; he would oppose him\nas much as he could; and Mr Bradshaw would be angry, and a storm\nwould arise, from the bare thought of which Ruth shrank with the\ncowardliness of a person thoroughly worn out with late contest. She\nwas bodily wearied with her spiritual buffeting.\n\nOne morning, three or four days after their departure, she received a\nletter from Miss Benson. She could not open it at first, and put it\non one side, clenching her hand over it all the time. At last she\ntore it open. Leonard was safe as yet. There were a few lines in his\ngreat round hand, speaking of events no larger than the loss of a\nbeautiful \"alley.\" There was a sheet from Miss Benson. She always\nwrote letters in the manner of a diary. \"Monday we did so-and-so;\nTuesday, so-and-so, &c.\" Ruth glanced rapidly down the page. Yes,\nhere it was! Sick, fluttering heart, be still!\n\n\"In the middle of the damsons, when they were just on the fire, there\nwas a knock at the door. My brother was out, and Sally was washing\nup, and I was stirring the preserve with my great apron and bib on;\nso I bade Leonard come in from the garden and open the door. But I\nwould have washed his face first, if I had known who it was! It was\nMr Bradshaw and the Mr Donne that they hope to send up to the House\nof Commons, as member of Parliament for Eccleston, and another\ngentleman, whose name I never heard. They had come canvassing; and\nwhen they found my brother was out, they asked Leonard if they could\nsee me. The child said, 'Yes! if I could leave the damsons;' and\nstraightway came to call me, leaving them standing in the passage. I\nwhipped off my apron, and took Leonard by the hand, for I fancied I\nshould feel less awkward if he was with me; and then I went and asked\nthem all into the study, for I thought I should like them to see how\nmany books Thurstan had got. Then they began talking politics at me\nin a very polite manner, only I could not make head or tail of what\nthey meant; and Mr Donne took a deal of notice of Leonard, and called\nhim to him; and I am sure he noticed what a noble, handsome boy he\nwas, though his face was very brown and red, and hot with digging,\nand his curls all tangled. Leonard talked back as if he had known him\nall his life, till, I think, Mr Bradshaw thought he was making too\nmuch noise, and bid him remember he ought to be seen, not heard. So\nhe stood as still and stiff as a soldier, close to Mr Donne; and as\nI could not help looking at the two, and thinking how handsome they\nboth were in their different ways, I could not tell Thurstan half the\nmessages the gentlemen left for him. But there was one thing more I\nmust tell you, though I said I would not. When Mr Donne was talking\nto Leonard, he took off his watch and chain and put it round the\nboy's neck, who was pleased enough, you may be sure. I bade him give\nit back to the gentleman, when they were all going away; and I was\nquite surprised, and very uncomfortable, when Mr Donne said he had\ngiven it to Leonard, and that he was to keep it for his own. I could\nsee Mr Bradshaw was annoyed, and he and the other gentleman spoke to\nMr Donne, and I heard them say, 'too barefaced;' and I shall never\nforget Mr Donne's proud, stubborn look back at them, nor his way of\nsaying, 'I allow no one to interfere with what I choose to do with my\nown.' And he looked so haughty and displeased, I durst say nothing\nat the time. But when I told Thurstan, he was very grieved and angry;\nand said he had heard that our party were bribing, but that he never\ncould have thought they would have tried to do it at his house.\nThurstan is very much out of spirits about this election altogether;\nand, indeed, it does make sad work up and down the town. However, he\nsent back the watch with a letter to Mr Bradshaw; and Leonard was\nvery good about it, so I gave him a taste of the new damson-preserve\non his bread for supper.\"\n\nAlthough a stranger might have considered this letter wearisome\nfrom the multiplicity of the details, Ruth craved greedily after\nmore. What had Mr Donne said to Leonard? Had Leonard liked his new\nacquaintance? Were they likely to meet again? After wondering and\nwondering over these points, Ruth composed herself by the hope that\nin a day or two she should hear again; and to secure this end, she\nanswered the letters by return of post. That was on Thursday. On\nFriday she had another letter, in a strange hand. It was from Mr\nDonne. No name, no initials were given. If it had fallen into another\nperson's hands, they could not have recognised the writer, nor\nguessed to whom it was sent. It contained simply these words:\n\n\"For our child's sake, and in his name, I summon you to appoint a\nplace where I can speak, and you can listen, undisturbed. The time\nmust be on Sunday; the limit of distance may be the circumference of\nyour power of walking. My words may be commands, but my fond heart\nentreats. More I shall not say now, but, remember! your boy's welfare\ndepends on your acceding to this request. Address B. D., Post-Office,\nEccleston.\"\n\nRuth did not attempt to answer this letter till the last five minutes\nbefore the post went out. She could not decide until forced to it.\nEither way she dreaded. She was very nearly leaving the letter\naltogether unanswered. But suddenly she resolved she would know all,\nthe best, the worst. No cowardly dread of herself, or of others,\nshould make her neglect aught that came to her in her child's name.\nShe took up a pen and wrote:\n\n\"The sands below the rocks, where we met you the other night. Time,\nafternoon church.\"\n\nSunday came.\n\n\"I shall not go to church this afternoon. You know the way, of\ncourse; and I can trust you to go steadily by yourselves.\"\n\nWhen they came to kiss her before leaving her, according to their\nfond wont, they were struck by the coldness of her face and lips.\n\n\"Are you not well, dear Mrs Denbigh? How cold you are!\"\n\n\"Yes, darling! I am well;\" and tears sprang into her eyes as she\nlooked at their anxious little faces. \"Go now, dears. Five o'clock\nwill soon be here, and then we will have tea.\"\n\n\"And that will warm you!\" said they, leaving the room.\n\n\"And then it will be over,\" she murmured--\"over.\"\n\nIt never came into her head to watch the girls as they disappeared\ndown the lane on their way to church. She knew them too well to\ndistrust their doing what they were told. She sat still, her head\nbowed on her arms for a few minutes, and then rose up and went to put\non her walking things. Some thoughts impelled her to sudden haste.\nShe crossed the field by the side of the house, ran down the steep\nand rocky path, and was carried by the impetus of her descent far\nout on the level sands--but not far enough for her intent. Without\nlooking to the right hand or to the left, where comers might be\nseen, she went forwards to the black posts, which, rising above the\nheaving waters, marked where the fishermen's nets were laid. She went\nstraight towards this place, and hardly stinted her pace even where\nthe wet sands were glittering with the receding waves. Once there,\nshe turned round, and in a darting glance, saw that as yet no one\nwas near. She was perhaps half-a-mile or more from the grey, silvery\nrocks, which sloped away into brown moorland, interspersed with a\nfield here and there of golden, waving corn. Behind were purple\nhills, with sharp, clear outlines, touching the sky. A little on one\nside from where she stood, she saw the white cottages and houses\nwhich formed the village of Abermouth, scattered up and down, and, on\na windy hill, about a mile inland, she saw the little grey church,\nwhere even now many were worshipping in peace.\n\n\"Pray for me!\" she sighed out, as this object caught her eye.\n\nAnd now, close under the heathery fields, where they fell softly down\nand touched the sands, she saw a figure moving in the direction of\nthe great shadow made by the rocks--going towards the very point\nwhere the path from Eagle's Crag came down to the shore.\n\n\"It is he!\" said she to herself. And she turned round and looked\nseaward. The tide had turned; the waves were slowly receding, as\nif loath to lose the hold they had, so lately, and with such swift\nbounds, gained on the yellow sands. The eternal moan they have made\nsince the world began filled the ear, broken only by the skirl of the\ngrey sea-birds as they alighted in groups on the edge of the waters,\nor as they rose up with their measured, balancing motion, and the\nsunlight caught their white breasts. There was no sign of human life\nto be seen; no boat, or distant sail, or near shrimper. The black\nposts there were all that spoke of men's work or labour. Beyond a\nstretch of the waters, a few pale grey hills showed like films; their\nsummits clear, though faint, their bases lost in a vapoury mist.\n\nOn the hard, echoing sands, and distinct from the ceaseless murmur of\nthe salt sea waves, came footsteps--nearer--nearer. Very near they\nwere when Ruth, unwilling to show the fear that rioted in her heart,\nturned round, and faced Mr Donne.\n\nHe came forward, with both hands extended.\n\n\"This is kind! my own Ruth,\" said he. Ruth's arms hung down\nmotionless at her sides.\n\n\"What! Ruth, have you no word for me?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say,\" said Ruth.\n\n\"Why, you little revengeful creature! And so I am to explain all\nbefore you will even treat me with decent civility.\"\n\n\"I do not want explanations,\" said Ruth, in a trembling tone. \"We\nmust not speak of the past. You asked me to come in Leonard's--in my\nchild's name, and to hear what you had to say about him.\"\n\n\"But what I have to say about him relates to you even more. And how\ncan we talk about him without recurring to the past? That past, which\nyou try to ignore--I know you cannot do it in your heart--is full of\nhappy recollections to me. Were you not happy in Wales?\" he said, in\nhis tenderest tone.\n\nBut there was no answer; not even one faint sigh, though he listened\nintently.\n\n\"You dare not speak; you dare not answer me. Your heart will not\nallow you to prevaricate, and you know you were happy.\"\n\nSuddenly Ruth's beautiful eyes were raised to him, full of lucid\nsplendour, but grave and serious in their expression; and her cheeks,\nheretofore so faintly tinged with the tenderest blush, flashed into a\nruddy glow.\n\n\"I was happy. I do not deny it. Whatever comes, I will not blench\nfrom the truth. I have answered you.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" replied he, secretly exulting in her admission, and not\nperceiving the inner strength of which she must have been conscious\nbefore she would have dared to make it--\"and yet, Ruth, we are not\nto recur to the past! Why not? If it was happy at the time, is the\nrecollection of it so miserable to you?\"\n\nHe tried once more to take her hand, but she quietly stepped back.\n\n\"I came to hear what you had to say about my child,\" said she,\nbeginning to feel very weary.\n\n\"_Our_ child, Ruth.\"\n\nShe drew herself up, and her face went very pale.\n\n\"What have you to say about him?\" asked she, coldly.\n\n\"Much,\" exclaimed he--\"much that may affect his whole life. But it\nall depends upon whether you will hear me or not.\"\n\n\"I listen.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens! Ruth, you will drive me mad. Oh! what a changed person\nyou are from the sweet, loving creature you were! I wish you were not\nso beautiful.\" She did not reply, but he caught a deep, involuntary\nsigh.\n\n\"Will you hear me if I speak, though I may not begin all at once\nto talk of this boy--a boy of whom any mother--any parent, might\nbe proud? I could see that, Ruth. I have seen him; he looked like\na prince in that cramped, miserable house, and with no earthly\nadvantages. It is a shame he should not have every kind of\nopportunity laid open before him.\"\n\nThere was no sign of maternal ambition on the motionless face, though\nthere might be some little spring in her heart, as it beat quick and\nstrong at the idea of the proposal she imagined he was going to make\nof taking her boy away to give him the careful education she had\noften craved for him. She should refuse it, as she would everything\nelse which seemed to imply that she acknowledged a claim over\nLeonard; but yet sometimes, for her boy's sake, she had longed for a\nlarger opening--a more extended sphere.\n\n\"Ruth! you acknowledge we were happy once;--there were circumstances\nwhich, if I could tell you them all in detail, would show you how\nin my weak, convalescent state I was almost passive in the hands of\nothers. Ah, Ruth! I have not forgotten the tender nurse who soothed\nme in my delirium. When I am feverish, I dream that I am again at\nLlan-dhu, in the little old bed-chamber, and you, in white--which you\nalways wore then, you know--flitting about me.\"\n\nThe tears dropped, large and round, from Ruth's eyes--she could not\nhelp it--how could she?\n\n\"We were happy then,\" continued he, gaining confidence from the sight\nof her melted mood, and recurring once more to the admission which he\nconsidered so much in his favour. \"Can such happiness never return?\"\nThus he went on, quickly, anxious to lay before her all he had to\noffer, before she should fully understand his meaning.\n\n\"If you would consent, Leonard should be always with you--educated\nwhere and how you liked--money to any amount you might choose to name\nshould be secured to you and him--if only, Ruth--if only those happy\ndays might return.\"\n\nRuth spoke.\n\n\"I said that I was happy, because I had asked God to protect and help\nme--and I dared not tell a lie. I was happy. Oh! what is happiness or\nmisery that we should talk about them now?\"\n\nMr Donne looked at her, as she uttered these words, to see if she\nwas wandering in her mind, they seemed to him so utterly strange and\nincoherent.\n\n\"I dare not think of happiness--I must not look forward to sorrow.\nGod did not put me here to consider either of these things.\"\n\n\"My dear Ruth, compose yourself! There is no hurry in answering the\nquestion I asked.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" said Ruth.\n\n\"I love you so, I cannot live without you. I offer you my heart, my\nlife--I offer to place Leonard wherever you would have him placed. I\nhave the power and the means to advance him in any path of life you\nchoose. All who have shown kindness to you shall be rewarded by me,\nwith a gratitude even surpassing your own. If there is anything else\nI can do that you can suggest, I will do it.\"\n\n\"Listen to me!\" said Ruth, now that the idea of what he proposed had\nentered her mind. \"When I said that I was happy with you long ago, I\nwas choked with shame as I said it. And yet it may be a vain, false\nexcuse that I make for myself. I was very young; I did not know how\nsuch a life was against God's pure and holy will--at least, not as I\nknow it now; and I tell you truth--all the days of my years since I\nhave gone about with a stain on my hidden soul--a stain which made me\nloathe myself, and envy those who stood spotless and undefiled; which\nmade me shrink from my child--from Mr Benson, from his sister, from\nthe innocent girls whom I teach--nay, even I have cowered away from\nGod Himself; and what I did wrong then, I did blindly to what I\nshould do now if I listened to you.\"\n\nShe was so strongly agitated that she put her hands over her face,\nand sobbed without restraint. Then, taking them away, she looked at\nhim with a glowing face, and beautiful, honest, wet eyes, and tried\nto speak calmly, as she asked if she needed to stay longer (she would\nhave gone away at once but that she thought of Leonard, and wished to\nhear all that his father might have to say). He was so struck anew by\nher beauty, and understood her so little, that he believed that she\nonly required a little more urging to consent to what he wished; for\nin all she had said there was no trace of the anger and resentment\nfor his desertion of her, which he had expected would be a prominent\nfeature--the greatest obstacle he had to encounter. The deep sense\nof penitence she expressed, he mistook for earthly shame; which he\nimagined he could soon soothe away.\n\n\"Yes, I have much more to say. I have not said half. I cannot tell\nyou how fondly I will--how fondly I do love you--how my life shall\nbe spent in ministering to your wishes. Money, I see--I know, you\ndespise--\"\n\n\"Mr Bellingham! I will not stay to hear you speak to me so again.\nI have been sinful, but it is not you who should--\" She could not\nspeak, she was so choking with passionate sorrow.\n\nHe wanted to calm her, as he saw her shaken with repressed sobs. He\nput his hand on her arm. She shook it off impatiently, and moved away\nin an instant.\n\n\"Ruth!\" said he, nettled by her action of repugnance, \"I begin to\nthink you never loved me.\"\n\n\"I!--I never loved you! Do you dare to say so?\"\n\nHer eyes flamed on him as she spoke. Her red, round lip curled into\nbeautiful contempt.\n\n\"Why do you shrink so from me?\" said he, in his turn getting\nimpatient.\n\n\"I did not come here to be spoken to in this way,\" said she. \"I came,\nif by any chance I could do Leonard good. I would submit to many\nhumiliations for his sake--but to no more from you.\"\n\n\"Are not you afraid to brave me so?\" said he. \"Don't you know how\nmuch you are in my power?\"\n\nShe was silent. She longed to go away, but dreaded lest he should\nfollow her, where she might be less subject to interruption than she\nwas here--near the fisherman's nets, which the receding tide was\nleaving every moment barer and more bare, and the posts they were\nfastened to more blackly uprising above the waters.\n\nMr Donne put his hands on her arms as they hung down before her--her\nhands tightly clasped together.\n\n\"Ask me to let you go,\" said he. \"I will, if you will ask me.\" He\nlooked very fierce and passionate and determined. The vehemence of\nhis action took Ruth by surprise, and the painful tightness of the\ngrasp almost made her exclaim. But she was quite still and mute.\n\n\"Ask me,\" said he, giving her a little shake. She did not speak. Her\neyes, fixed on the distant shore, were slowly filling with tears.\nSuddenly a light came through the mist that obscured them, and the\nshut lips parted. She saw some distant object that gave her hope.\n\n\"It is Stephen Bromley,\" said she. \"He is coming to his nets. They\nsay he is a very desperate, violent man, but he will protect me.\"\n\n\"You obstinate, wilful creature!\" said Mr Donne, releasing his grasp.\n\"You forget that one word of mine could undeceive all these good\npeople at Eccleston; and that if I spoke out ever so little, they\nwould throw you off in an instant. Now!\" he continued, \"do you\nunderstand how much you are in my power?\"\n\n\"Mr and Miss Benson know all--they have not thrown me off,\" Ruth\ngasped out. \"Oh! for Leonard's sake! you would not be so cruel.\"\n\n\"Then do not you be cruel to him--to me. Think once more!\"\n\n\"I think once more;\" she spoke solemnly. \"To save Leonard from the\nshame and agony of knowing my disgrace, I would lie down and die. Oh!\nperhaps it would be best for him--for me, if I might; my death would\nbe a stingless grief--but to go back into sin would be the real\ncruelty to him. The errors of my youth may be washed away by my\ntears--it was so once when the gentle, blessed Christ was upon earth;\nbut now, if I went into wilful guilt, as you would have me, how could\nI teach Leonard God's holy will? I should not mind his knowing my\npast sin, compared to the awful corruption it would be if he knew\nme living now, as you would have me, lost to all fear of God--\" Her\nspeech was broken by sobs. \"Whatever may be my doom--God is just--I\nleave myself in His hands. I will save Leonard from evil. Evil\nwould it be for him if I lived with you. I will let him die first!\"\nShe lifted her eyes to heaven, and clasped and wreathed her hands\ntogether tight. Then she said: \"You have humbled me enough, sir. I\nshall leave you now.\"\n\nShe turned away resolutely. The dark, grey fisherman was at hand. Mr\nDonne folded his arms, and set his teeth, and looked after her.\n\n\"What a stately step she has! How majestic and graceful all her\nattitudes were! She thinks she has baffled me now. We will try\nsomething more, and bid a higher price.\" He unfolded his arms, and\nbegan to follow her. He gained upon her, for her beautiful walk was\nnow wavering and unsteady. The works which had kept her in motion\nwere running down fast.\n\n\"Ruth!\" said he, overtaking her. \"You shall hear me once more.\nAye, look round! Your fisherman is near. He may hear me, if he\nchooses--hear your triumph. I am come to offer to marry you, Ruth;\ncome what may, I will have you. Nay--I will make you hear me. I will\nhold this hand till you have heard me. To-morrow I will speak to\nany one in Eccleston you like--to Mr Bradshaw; Mr ----, the little\nminister, I mean. We can make it worth while for him to keep our\nsecret, and no one else need know but what you are really Mrs\nDenbigh. Leonard shall still bear this name, but in all things else\nhe shall be treated as my son. He and you would grace any situation.\nI will take care the highest paths are open to him!\"\n\nHe looked to see the lovely face brighten into sudden joy; on the\ncontrary, the head was still hung down with a heavy droop.\n\n\"I cannot,\" said she; her voice was very faint and low.\n\n\"It is sudden for you, my dearest. But be calm. It will all be easily\nmanaged. Leave it to me.\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" repeated she, more distinct and clear, though still very\nlow.\n\n\"Why! what on earth makes you say that?\" asked he, in a mood to be\nirritated by any repetition of such words.\n\n\"I do not love you. I did once. Don't say I did not love you then;\nbut I do not now. I could never love you again. All you have said\nand done since you came with Mr Bradshaw to Abermouth first, has\nonly made me wonder how I ever could have loved you. We are very far\napart. The time that has pressed down my life like brands of hot\niron, and scarred me for ever, has been nothing to you. You have\ntalked of it with no sound of moaning in your voice--no shadow over\nthe brightness of your face; it has left no sense of sin on your\nconscience, while me it haunts and haunts; and yet I might plead that\nI was an ignorant child--only I will not plead anything, for God\nknows all-- But this is only one piece of our great difference--\"\n\n\"You mean that I am no saint,\" he said, impatient at her speech.\n\"Granted. But people who are no saints have made very good\nhusbands before now. Come, don't let any morbid, overstrained\nconscientiousness interfere with substantial happiness--happiness\nboth to you and to me--for I am sure I can make you happy--aye! and\nmake you love me, too, in spite of your pretty defiance. I love you\nso dearly I must win love back. And here are advantages for Leonard,\nto be gained by you quite in a holy and legitimate way.\"\n\nShe stood very erect.\n\n\"If there was one thing needed to confirm me, you have named it. You\nshall have nothing to do with my boy, by my consent, much less by my\nagency. I would rather see him working on the roadside than leading\nsuch a life--being such a one as you are. You have heard my mind\nnow, Mr Bellingham. You have humbled me--you have baited me; and\nif at last I have spoken out too harshly, and too much in a spirit\nof judgment, the fault is yours. If there were no other reason to\nprevent our marriage but the one fact that it would bring Leonard\ninto contact with you, that would be enough.\"\n\n\"It is enough!\" said he, making her a low bow. \"Neither you nor your\nchild shall ever more be annoyed by me. I wish you a good evening.\"\n\nThey walked apart--he back to the inn, to set off instantly, while\nthe blood was hot within him, from the place where he had been so\nmortified--she to steady herself along till she reached the little\npath, more like a rude staircase than anything else, by which she had\nto climb to the house.\n\nShe did not turn round for some time after she was fairly lost to\nthe sight of any one on the shore; she clambered on, almost stunned\nby the rapid beating of her heart. Her eyes were hot and dry; and\nat last became as if she were suddenly blind. Unable to go on, she\ntottered into the tangled underwood which grew among the stones,\nfilling every niche and crevice, and little shelving space, with\ngreen and delicate tracery. She sank down behind a great overhanging\nrock, which hid her from any one coming up the path. An ash-tree was\nrooted in this rock, slanting away from the sea-breezes that were\nprevalent in most weathers; but this was a still, autumnal Sabbath\nevening. As Ruth's limbs fell, so they lay. She had no strength, no\npower of volition to move a finger. She could not think or remember.\nShe was literally stunned. The first sharp sensation which roused\nher from her torpor was a quick desire to see him once more; up she\nsprang, and climbed to an out-jutting dizzy point of rock, but a\nlittle above her sheltered nook, yet commanding a wide view over the\nbare, naked sands;--far away below, touching the rippling water-line,\nwas Stephen Bromley, busily gathering in his nets; besides him there\nwas no living creature visible. Ruth shaded her eyes, as if she\nthought they might have deceived her; but no, there was no one there.\nShe went slowly down to her old place, crying sadly as she went.\n\n\"Oh! if I had not spoken so angrily to him--the last things I said\nwere so bitter--so reproachful!--and I shall never, never see him\nagain!\"\n\nShe could not take in the general view and scope of their\nconversation--the event was too near her for that; but her heart felt\nsore at the echo of her last words, just and true as their severity\nwas. Her struggle, her constant flowing tears, which fell from very\nweakness, made her experience a sensation of intense bodily fatigue;\nand her soul had lost the power of throwing itself forward, or\ncontemplating anything beyond the dreary present, when the expanse of\ngrey, wild, bleak moors, stretching wide away below a sunless sky,\nseemed only an outward sign of the waste world within her heart, for\nwhich she could claim no sympathy;--for she could not even define\nwhat its woes were; and if she could, no one would understand how the\npresent time was haunted by the terrible ghost of the former love.\n\n\"I am so weary! I am so weary!\" she moaned aloud at last. \"I wonder\nif I might stop here, and just die away.\"\n\nShe shut her eyes, until through the closed lids came a ruddy blaze\nof light. The clouds had parted away, and the sun was going down in a\ncrimson glory behind the distant purple hills. The whole western sky\nwas one flame of fire. Ruth forgot herself in looking at the gorgeous\nsight. She sat up gazing, and, as she gazed, the tears dried on her\ncheeks; and, somehow, all human care and sorrow were swallowed up in\nthe unconscious sense of God's infinity. The sunset calmed her more\nthan any words, however wise and tender, could have done. It even\nseemed to give her strength and courage; she did not know how or why,\nbut so it was.\n\nShe rose, and went slowly towards home. Her limbs were very stiff,\nand every now and then she had to choke down an unbidden sob. Her\npupils had been long returned from church, and had busied themselves\nin preparing tea--an occupation which had probably made them feel the\ntime less long.\n\nIf they had ever seen a sleep-walker, they might have likened Ruth\nto one for the next few days, so slow and measured did her movements\nseem--so far away was her intelligence from all that was passing\naround her--so hushed and strange were the tones of her voice. They\nhad letters from home announcing the triumphant return of Mr Donne as\nM.P. for Eccleston. Mrs Denbigh heard the news without a word, and\nwas too languid to join in the search after purple and yellow flowers\nwith which to deck the sitting-room at Eagle's Crag.\n\nA letter from Jemima came the next day, summoning them home. Mr Donne\nand his friends had left the place, and quiet was restored in the\nBradshaw household; so it was time that Mary's and Elizabeth's\nholiday should cease. Mrs Denbigh had also a letter--a letter from\nMiss Benson, saying that Leonard was not quite well. There was so\nmuch pains taken to disguise anxiety, that it was very evident much\nanxiety was felt; and the girls were almost alarmed by Ruth's sudden\nchange from taciturn langour to eager, vehement energy. Body and mind\nseemed strained to exertion. Every plan that could facilitate packing\nand winding-up affairs at Abermouth, every errand and arrangement\nthat could expedite their departure by one minute, was done by Ruth\nwith stern promptitude. She spared herself in nothing. She made\nthem rest, made them lie down, while she herself lifted weights and\ntransacted business with feverish power, never resting, and trying\nnever to have time to think.\n\nFor in remembrance of the Past there was Remorse,--how had she\nforgotten Leonard these last few days!--how had she repined and been\ndull of heart to her blessing! And in anticipation of the Future\nthere was one sharp point of red light in the darkness which pierced\nher brain with agony, and which she would not see or recognise--and\nsaw and recognised all the more for such mad determination--which is\nnot the true shield against the bitterness of the arrows of Death.\n\nWhen the seaside party arrived in Eccleston, they were met by Mrs and\nMiss Bradshaw and Mr Benson. By a firm resolution, Ruth kept from\nshaping the question, \"Is he alive?\" as if by giving shape to her\nfears she made their realisation more imminent. She said merely, \"How\nis he?\" but she said it with drawn, tight, bloodless lips, and in her\neyes Mr Benson read her anguish of anxiety.\n\n\"He is very ill, but we hope he will soon be better. It is what every\nchild has to go through.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nJemima Makes a Discovery\n\n\nMr Bradshaw had been successful in carrying his point. His member had\nbeen returned; his proud opponents mortified. So the public thought\nhe ought to be well pleased; but the public were disappointed to see\nthat he did not show any of the gratification they supposed him to\nfeel.\n\nThe truth was, that he had met with so many small mortifications\nduring the progress of the election, that the pleasure which he would\notherwise have felt in the final success of his scheme was much\ndiminished.\n\nHe had more than tacitly sanctioned bribery; and now that the\nexcitement was over, he regretted it; not entirely from conscientious\nmotives, though he was uneasy from a slight sense of wrong-doing; but\nhe was more pained, after all, to think that, in the eyes of some of\nhis townsmen, his hitherto spotless character had received a blemish.\nHe, who had been so stern and severe a censor on the undue influence\nexercised by the opposite party in all preceding elections, could not\nexpect to be spared by their adherents now, when there were rumours\nthat the hands of the scrupulous Dissenters were not clean. Before,\nit had been his boast that neither friend nor enemy could say one\nword against him; now, he was constantly afraid of an indictment for\nbribery, and of being compelled to appear before a Committee to swear\nto his own share in the business.\n\nHis uneasy, fearful consciousness made him stricter and sterner\nthan ever; as if he would quench all wondering, slanderous talk\nabout him in the town by a renewed austerity of uprightness; that\nthe slack-principled Mr Bradshaw of one month of ferment and\nexcitement might not be confounded with the highly-conscientious and\ndeeply-religious Mr Bradshaw, who went to chapel twice a day, and\ngave a hundred pounds a-piece to every charity in the town, as a sort\nof thank-offering that his end was gained.\n\nBut he was secretly dissatisfied with Mr Donne. In general, that\ngentleman had been rather too willing to act in accordance with\nany one's advice, no matter whose; as if he had thought it too\nmuch trouble to weigh the wisdom of his friends, in which case Mr\nBradshaw's would have, doubtless, proved the most valuable. But\nnow and then he unexpectedly, and utterly without reason, took the\nconduct of affairs into his own hands, as when he had been absent\nwithout leave only just before the day of nomination. No one guessed\nwhither he had gone; but the fact of his being gone was enough to\nchagrin Mr Bradshaw, who was quite ready to pick a quarrel on this\nvery head, if the election had not terminated favourably. As it\nwas, he had a feeling of proprietorship in Mr Donne which was not\ndisagreeable. He had given the new M.P. his seat; his resolution,\nhis promptitude, his energy, had made Mr Donne \"our member;\" and Mr\nBradshaw began to feel proud of him accordingly. But there had been\nno one circumstance during this period to bind Jemima and Mr Farquhar\ntogether. They were still misunderstanding each other with all their\npower. The difference in the result was this: Jemima loved him all\nthe more, in spite of quarrels and coolness. He was growing utterly\nweary of the petulant temper of which he was never certain; of the\nreception which varied day after day, according to the mood she was\nin and the thoughts that were uppermost; and he was almost startled\nto find how very glad he was that the little girls and Mrs Denbigh\nwere coming home. His was a character to bask in peace; and lovely,\nquiet Ruth, with her low tones and quiet replies, her delicate waving\nmovements, appeared to him the very type of what a woman should be--a\ncalm, serene soul, fashioning the body to angelic grace.\n\nIt was, therefore, with no slight interest that Mr Farquhar inquired\ndaily after the health of little Leonard. He asked at the Bensons'\nhouse; and Sally answered him, with swollen and tearful eyes, that\nthe child was very bad--very bad indeed. He asked at the doctor's;\nand the doctor told him, in a few short words, that \"it was only a\nbad kind of measles, and that the lad might have a struggle for it,\nbut he thought he would get through. Vigorous children carried their\nforce into everything; never did things by halves; if they were ill,\nthey were sure to be in a high fever directly; if they were well,\nthere was no peace in the house for their rioting. For his part,\"\ncontinued the doctor, \"he thought he was glad he had had no children;\nas far as he could judge, they were pretty much all plague and no\nprofit.\" But as he ended his speech he sighed; and Mr Farquhar\nwas none the less convinced that common report was true, which\nrepresented the clever, prosperous surgeon of Eccleston as bitterly\ndisappointed at his failure of offspring.\n\nWhile these various interests and feelings had their course outside\nthe Chapel-house, within there was but one thought which possessed\nall the inmates. When Sally was not cooking for the little invalid,\nshe was crying; for she had had a dream about green rushes, not\nthree months ago, which, by some queer process of oneiromancy she\ninterpreted to mean the death of a child; and all Miss Benson's\nendeavours were directed to making her keep silence to Ruth about\nthis dream. Sally thought that the mother ought to be told; what were\ndreams sent for but for warnings? But it was just like a pack of\nDissenters, who would not believe anything like other folks. Miss\nBenson was too much accustomed to Sally's contempt for Dissenters, as\nviewed from the pinnacle of the Establishment, to pay much attention\nto all this grumbling; especially as Sally was willing to take as\nmuch trouble about Leonard as if she believed he was going to live,\nand that his recovery depended upon her care. Miss Benson's great\nobject was to keep her from having any confidential talks with Ruth;\nas if any repetition of the dream could have deepened the conviction\nin Ruth's mind that the child would die.\n\nIt seemed to her that his death would only be the fitting punishment\nfor the state of indifference towards him--towards life and\ndeath--towards all things earthly or divine, into which she had\nsuffered herself to fall since her last interview with Mr Donne.\nShe did not understand that such exhaustion is but the natural\nconsequence of violent agitation and severe tension of feeling. The\nonly relief she experienced was in constantly serving Leonard; she\nhad almost an animal's jealousy lest any one should come between her\nand her young. Mr Benson saw this jealous suspicion, although he\ncould hardly understand it; but he calmed his sister's wonder and\nofficious kindness, so that the two patiently and quietly provided\nall that Ruth might want, but did not interfere with her right to\nnurse Leonard. But when he was recovering, Mr Benson, with the slight\ntone of authority he knew how to assume when need was, bade Ruth\nlie down and take some rest, while his sister watched. Ruth did not\nanswer, but obeyed in a dull, weary kind of surprise at being so\ncommanded. She lay down by her child, gazing her fill at his calm\nslumber; and as she gazed, her large white eyelids were softly\npressed down as with a gentle irresistible weight, and she fell\nasleep.\n\nShe dreamed that she was once more on the lonely shore, striving to\ncarry Leonard away from some pursuer--some human pursuer--she knew he\nwas human, and she knew who he was, although she dared not say his\nname even to herself, he seemed so close and present, gaining on her\nflying footsteps, rushing after her as with the sound of the roaring\ntide. Her feet seemed heavy weights fixed to the ground; they would\nnot move. All at once, just near the shore, a great black whirlwind\nof waves clutched her back to her pursuer; she threw Leonard on to\nland, which was safety; but whether he reached it or no, or was swept\nback like her into a mysterious something too dreadful to be borne,\nshe did not know, for the terror awakened her. At first the dream\nseemed yet a reality, and she thought that the pursuer was couched\neven there, in that very room, and the great boom of the sea was\nstill in her ears. But as full consciousness returned, she saw\nherself safe in the dear old room--the haven of rest--the shelter\nfrom storms. A bright fire was glowing in the little old-fashioned,\ncup-shaped grate, niched into a corner of the wall, and guarded on\neither side by whitewashed bricks, which rested on hobs. On one of\nthese the kettle hummed and buzzed, within two points of boiling\nwhenever she or Leonard required tea. In her dream that home-like\nsound had been the roaring of the relentless sea, creeping swiftly on\nto seize its prey. Miss Benson sat by the fire, motionless and still;\nit was too dark to read any longer without a candle; but yet on the\nceiling and upper part of the walls the golden light of the setting\nsun was slowly moving--so slow, and yet a motion gives the feeling of\nrest to the weary yet more than perfect stillness. The old clock on\nthe staircase told its monotonous click-clack, in that soothing way\nwhich more marked the quiet of the house than disturbed with any\nsense of sound. Leonard still slept that renovating slumber, almost\nin her arms, far from that fatal pursuing sea, with its human form of\ncruelty. The dream was a vision; the reality which prompted the dream\nwas over and past--Leonard was safe--she was safe; all this loosened\nthe frozen springs, and they gushed forth in her heart, and her lips\nmoved in accordance with her thoughts.\n\n\"What were you saying, my darling?\" said Miss Benson, who caught\nsight of the motion, and fancied she was asking for something. Miss\nBenson bent over the side of the bed on which Ruth lay, to catch the\nlow tones of her voice.\n\n\"I only said,\" replied Ruth, timidly, \"thank God! I have so much to\nthank Him for, you don't know.\"\n\n\"My dear, I am sure we have all of us cause to be thankful that our\nboy is spared. See! he is wakening up; and we will have a cup of tea\ntogether.\"\n\nLeonard strode on to perfect health; but he was made older in\ncharacter and looks by his severe illness. He grew tall and thin, and\nthe lovely child was lost in the handsome boy. He began to wonder,\nand to question. Ruth mourned a little over the vanished babyhood,\nwhen she was all in all, and over the childhood, whose petals had\nfallen away; it seemed as though two of her children were gone--the\none an infant, the other a bright, thoughtless darling; and she\nwished that they could have remained quick in her memory for ever,\ninstead of being absorbed in loving pride for the present boy. But\nthese were only fanciful regrets, flitting like shadows across a\nmirror. Peace and thankfulness were once more the atmosphere of\nher mind; nor was her unconsciousness disturbed by any suspicion\nof Mr Farquhar's increasing approbation and admiration, which he\nwas diligently nursing up into love for her. She knew that he had\nsent--she did not know how often he had brought--fruit for the\nconvalescent Leonard. She heard, on her return from her daily\nemployment, that Mr Farquhar had brought a little gentle pony on\nwhich Leonard, weak as he was, might ride. To confess the truth, her\nmaternal pride was such that she thought that all kindness shown\nto such a boy as Leonard was but natural; she believed him to be\n\n\n   A child whom all that looked on, loved.\n\n\nAs in truth he was; and the proof of this was daily shown in many\nkind inquiries, and many thoughtful little offerings, besides Mr\nFarquhar's. The poor (warm and kind of heart to all sorrow common\nto humanity) were touched with pity for the young widow, whose only\nchild lay ill, and nigh unto death. They brought what they could--a\nfresh egg, when eggs were scarce--a few ripe pears that grew on the\nsunniest side of the humblest cottage, where the fruit was regarded\nas a source of income--a call of inquiry, and a prayer that God would\nspare the child, from an old crippled woman, who could scarcely drag\nherself so far as the Chapel-house, yet felt her worn and weary heart\nstirred with a sharp pang of sympathy, and a very present remembrance\nof the time when she too was young, and saw the life-breath quiver\nout of her child, now an angel in that heaven which felt more like\nhome to the desolate old creature than this empty earth. To all such,\nwhen Leonard was better, Ruth went, and thanked them from her heart.\nShe and the old cripple sat hand in hand over the scanty fire on the\nhearth of the latter, while she told in solemn, broken, homely words,\nhow her child sickened and died. Tears fell like rain down Ruth's\ncheeks; but those of the old woman were dry. All tears had been wept\nout of her long ago, and now she sat patient and quiet, waiting\nfor death. But after this, Ruth \"clave unto her,\" and the two were\nhenceforward a pair of friends. Mr Farquhar was only included in the\ngeneral gratitude which she felt towards all who had been kind to her\nboy.\n\nThe winter passed away in deep peace after the storms of the autumn,\nyet every now and then a feeling of insecurity made Ruth shake for an\ninstant. Those wild autumnal storms had torn aside the quiet flowers\nand herbage that had gathered over the wreck of her early life, and\nshown her that all deeds, however hidden and long passed by, have\ntheir eternal consequences. She turned sick and faint whenever Mr\nDonne's name was casually mentioned. No one saw it; but she felt the\nmiserable stop in her heart's beating, and wished that she could\nprevent it by any exercise of self-command. She had never named his\nidentity with Mr Bellingham, nor had she spoken about the seaside\ninterview. Deep shame made her silent and reserved on all her\nlife before Leonard's birth; from that time she rose again in her\nself-respect, and spoke as openly as a child (when need was) of all\noccurrences which had taken place since then; except that she could\nnot, and would not, tell of this mocking echo, this haunting phantom,\nthis past, that would not rest in its grave. The very circumstance\nthat it was stalking abroad in the world, and might reappear at any\nmoment, made her a coward: she trembled away from contemplating what\nthe reality had been; only she clung more faithfully than before\nto the thought of the great God, who was a rock in the dreary land,\nwhere no shadow was.\n\nAutumn and winter, with their lowering skies, were less dreary than\nthe woeful, desolate feelings that shed a gloom on Jemima. She found\ntoo late that she had considered Mr Farquhar so securely her own\nfor so long a time, that her heart refused to recognise him as lost\nto her, unless her reason went through the same weary, convincing,\nmiserable evidence day after day, and hour after hour. He never spoke\nto her now, except from common civility. He never cared for her\ncontradictions; he never tried, with patient perseverance, to bring\nher over to his opinions; he never used the wonted wiles (so tenderly\nremembered now they had no existence but in memory) to bring her\nround out of some wilful mood--and such moods were common enough\nnow! Frequently she was sullenly indifferent to the feelings of\nothers--not from any unkindness, but because her heart seemed\nnumb and stony, and incapable of sympathy. Then afterwards her\nself-reproach was terrible--in the dead of night, when no one saw it.\nWith a strange perversity, the only intelligence she cared to hear,\nthe only sights she cared to see, were the circumstances which gave\nconfirmation to the idea that Mr Farquhar was thinking of Ruth for a\nwife. She craved with stinging curiosity to hear something of their\naffairs every day; partly because the torture which such intelligence\ngave was almost a relief from the deadness of her heart to all other\ninterests.\n\nAnd so spring (_gioventu dell'anno_) came back to her, bringing all\nthe contrasts which spring alone can bring to add to the heaviness of\nthe soul. The little winged creatures filled the air with bursts of\njoy; the vegetation came bright and hopefully onwards, without any\ncheck of nipping frost. The ash-trees in the Bradshaws' garden were\nout in leaf by the middle of May, which that year wore more the\naspect of summer than most Junes do. The sunny weather mocked Jemima,\nand the unusual warmth oppressed her physical powers. She felt very\nweak and languid; she was acutely sensible that no one else noticed\nher want of strength; father, mother, all seemed too full of other\nthings to care if, as she believed, her life was waning. She herself\nfelt glad that it was so. But her delicacy was not unnoticed by all.\nHer mother often anxiously asked her husband if he did not think\nJemima was looking ill; nor did his affirmation to the contrary\nsatisfy her, as most of his affirmations did. She thought every\nmorning, before she got up, how she could tempt Jemima to eat, by\nordering some favourite dainty for dinner; in many other little ways\nshe tried to minister to her child; but the poor girl's own abrupt\nirritability of temper had made her mother afraid of openly speaking\nto her about her health.\n\nRuth, too, saw that Jemima was not looking well. How she had become\nan object of dislike to her former friend she did not know; but\nshe was sensible that Miss Bradshaw disliked her now. She was not\naware that this feeling was growing and strengthening almost into\nrepugnance, for she seldom saw Jemima out of school-hours, and then\nonly for a minute or two. But the evil element of a fellow-creature's\ndislike oppressed the atmosphere of her life. That fellow-creature\nwas one who had once loved her so fondly, and whom she still loved,\nalthough she had learnt to fear her, as we fear those whose faces\ncloud over when we come in sight--who cast unloving glances at us,\nof which we, though not seeing, are conscious, as of some occult\ninfluence; and the cause of whose dislike is unknown to us, though\nevery word and action seems to increase it. I believe that this sort\nof dislike is only shown by the jealous, and that it renders the\ndisliker even more miserable, because more continually conscious than\nthe object; but the growing evidence of Jemima's feeling made Ruth\nvery unhappy at times. This very May, too, an idea had come into her\nmind, which she had tried to repress--namely, that Mr Farquhar was in\nlove with her. It annoyed her extremely; it made her reproach herself\nthat she ever should think such a thing possible. She tried to\nstrangle the notion, to drown it, to starve it out by neglect--its\nexistence caused her such pain and distress.\n\nThe worst was, he had won Leonard's heart, who was constantly\nseeking him out; or, when absent, talking about him. The best was\nsome journey connected with business, which would take him to the\nContinent for several weeks; and, during that time, surely this\ndisagreeable fancy of his would die away, if untrue; and if true,\nsome way would be opened by which she might put a stop to all\nincrease of predilection on his part, and yet retain him as a friend\nfor Leonard--that darling for whom she was far-seeing and covetous,\nand miserly of every scrap of love and kindly regard.\n\nMr Farquhar would not have been flattered if he had known how much\nhis departure contributed to Ruth's rest of mind on the Saturday\nafternoon on which he set out on his journey. It was a beautiful day;\nthe sky of that intense quivering blue which seemed as though you\ncould look through it for ever, yet not reach the black, infinite\nspace which is suggested as lying beyond. Now and then a thin, torn,\nvaporous cloud floated slowly within the vaulted depth; but the soft\nair that gently wafted it was not perceptible among the leaves on the\ntrees, which did not even tremble. Ruth sat at her work in the shadow\nformed by the old grey garden wall; Miss Benson and Sally--the one in\nthe parlour window-seat mending stockings, the other hard at work in\nher kitchen--were both within talking distance, for it was weather\nfor open doors and windows; but none of the three kept up any\ncontinued conversation; and in the intervals Ruth sang low a brooding\nsong, such as she remembered her mother singing long ago. Now and\nthen she stopped to look at Leonard, who was labouring away with\nvehement energy at digging over a small plot of ground, where he\nmeant to prick out some celery plants that had been given to him.\nRuth's heart warmed at the earnest, spirited way in which he thrust\nhis large spade deep down into the brown soil, his ruddy face\nglowing, his curly hair wet with the exertion; and yet she sighed\nto think that the days were over when her deeds of skill could give\nhim pleasure. Now, his delight was in acting himself; last year, not\nfourteen months ago, he had watched her making a daisy-chain for him,\nas if he could not admire her cleverness enough; this year--this\nweek, when she had been devoting every spare hour to the simple\ntailoring which she performed for her boy (she had always made every\narticle he wore, and felt almost jealous of the employment), he had\ncome to her with a wistful look, and asked when he might begin to\nhave clothes made by a man?\n\nEver since the Wednesday when she had accompanied Mary and Elizabeth,\nat Mrs Bradshaw's desire, to be measured for spring clothes by the\nnew Eccleston dressmaker, she had been looking forward to this\nSaturday afternoon's pleasure of making summer trousers for Leonard;\nbut the satisfaction of the employment was a little taken away by\nLeonard's speech. It was a sign, however, that her life was very\nquiet and peaceful, that she had leisure to think upon the thing at\nall; and often she forgot it entirely in her low, chanting song, or\nin listening to the thrush warbling out his afternoon ditty to his\npatient mate in the holly-bush below.\n\nThe distant rumble of carts through the busy streets (it was\nmarket-day) not only formed a low rolling bass to the nearer and\npleasanter sounds, but enhanced the sense of peace by the suggestion\nof the contrast afforded to the repose of the garden by the bustle\nnot far off.\n\nBut besides physical din and bustle, there is mental strife and\nturmoil.\n\nThat afternoon, as Jemima was restlessly wandering about the house,\nher mother desired her to go on an errand to Mrs Pearson's, the new\ndressmaker, in order to give some directions about her sisters' new\nfrocks. Jemima went, rather than have the trouble of resisting;\nor else she would have preferred staying at home, moving or being\noutwardly quiet according to her own fitful will. Mrs Bradshaw, who,\nas I have said, had been aware for some time that something was wrong\nwith her daughter, and was very anxious to set it to rights if she\nonly knew how, had rather planned this errand with a view to dispel\nJemima's melancholy.\n\n\"And, Mimie, dear,\" said her mother, \"when you are there, look out\nfor a new bonnet for yourself; she has got some very pretty ones, and\nyour old one is so shabby.\"\n\n\"It does for me, mother,\" said Jemima, heavily. \"I don't want a new\nbonnet.\"\n\n\"But I want you to have one, my lassie. I want my girl to look well\nand nice.\"\n\nThere was something of homely tenderness in Mrs Bradshaw's tone that\ntouched Jemima's heart. She went to her mother, and kissed her with\nmore of affection than she had shown to any one for weeks before; and\nthe kiss was returned with warm fondness.\n\n\"I think you love me, mother,\" said Jemima.\n\n\"We all love you, dear, if you would but think so. And if you want\nanything, or wish for anything, only tell me, and with a little\npatience I can get your father to give it you, I know. Only be happy,\nthere's a good girl.\"\n\n\"Be happy! as if one could by an effort of will!\" thought Jemima, as\nshe went along the street, too absorbed in herself to notice the bows\nof acquaintances and friends, but instinctively guiding herself right\namong the throng and press of carts, and gigs, and market people in\nHigh Street.\n\nBut her mother's tones and looks, with their comforting power,\nremained longer in her recollection than the inconsistency of any\nwords spoken. When she had completed her errand about the frocks, she\nasked to look at some bonnets, in order to show her recognition of\nher mother's kind thought.\n\nMrs Pearson was a smart, clever-looking woman of five or six and\nthirty. She had all the variety of small-talk at her finger-ends\nthat was formerly needed by barbers to amuse the people who came to\nbe shaved. She had admired the town till Jemima was weary of its\npraises, sick and oppressed by its sameness, as she had been these\nmany weeks.\n\n\"Here are some bonnets, ma'am, that will be just the thing for\nyou--elegant and tasty, yet quite of the simple style, suitable to\nyoung ladies. Oblige me by trying on this white silk!\"\n\nJemima looked at herself in the glass; she was obliged to own it was\nvery becoming, and perhaps not the less so for the flush of modest\nshame which came into her cheeks as she heard Mrs Pearson's open\npraises of the \"rich, beautiful hair,\" and the \"Oriental eyes\" of the\nwearer.\n\n\"I induced the young lady who accompanied your sisters the other\nday--the governess, is she, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Yes--Mrs Denbigh is her name,\" said Jemima, clouding over.\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am. Well, I persuaded Mrs Denbigh to try on that\nbonnet, and you can't think how charming she looked in it; and yet I\ndon't think it became her as much as it does you.\"\n\n\"Mrs Denbigh is very beautiful,\" said Jemima, taking off the bonnet,\nand not much inclined to try on any other.\n\n\"Very, ma'am. Quite a peculiar style of beauty. If I might be\nallowed, I should say that hers was a Grecian style of loveliness,\nwhile yours was Oriental. She reminded me of a young person I once\nknew in Fordham.\" Mrs Pearson sighed an audible sigh.\n\n\"In Fordham!\" said Jemima, remembering that Ruth had once spoken of\nthe place as one in which she had spent some time, while the county\nin which it was situated was the same in which Ruth was born. \"In\nFordham! Why, I think Mrs Denbigh comes from that neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"Oh, ma'am! she cannot be the young person I mean--I am sure,\nma'am--holding the position she does in your establishment. I should\nhardly say I knew her myself; for I only saw her two or three times\nat my sister's house; but she was so remarked for her beauty, that I\nremember her face quite well--the more so, on account of her vicious\nconduct afterwards.\"\n\n\"Her vicious conduct!\" repeated Jemima, convinced by these words\nthat there could be no identity between Ruth and the \"young person\"\nalluded to. \"Then it could not have been our Mrs Denbigh.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, ma'am! I am sure I should be sorry to be understood to have\nsuggested anything of the kind. I beg your pardon if I did so. All\nI meant to say--and perhaps that was a liberty I ought not to have\ntaken, considering what Ruth Hilton was--\"\n\n\"Ruth Hilton!\" said Jemima, turning suddenly round, and facing Mrs\nPearson.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, that was the name of the young person I allude to.\"\n\n\"Tell me about her--what did she do?\" asked Jemima, subduing her\neagerness of tone and look as best she might, but trembling as on the\nverge of some strange discovery.\n\n\"I don't know whether I ought to tell you, ma'am--it is hardly a fit\nstory for a young lady; but this Ruth Hilton was an apprentice to\nmy sister-in-law, who had a first-rate business in Fordham, which\nbrought her a good deal of patronage from the county families; and\nthis young creature was very artful and bold, and thought sadly too\nmuch of her beauty; and, somehow, she beguiled a young gentleman, who\ntook her into keeping (I am sure, ma'am, I ought to apologise for\npolluting your ears--)\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Jemima, breathlessly.\n\n\"I don't know much more. His mother followed him into Wales. She was\na lady of a great deal of religion, and of a very old family, and\nwas much shocked at her son's misfortune in being captivated by\nsuch a person; but she led him to repentance, and took him to Paris,\nwhere, I think, she died; but I am not sure, for, owing to family\ndifferences, I have not been on terms for some years with my\nsister-in-law, who was my informant.\"\n\n\"Who died?\" interrupted Jemima--\"the young man's mother, or--or Ruth\nHilton?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, ma'am! pray don't confuse the two. It was the mother, Mrs--\nI forget the name--something like Billington. It was the lady who\ndied.\"\n\n\"And what became of the other?\" asked Jemima, unable, as her dark\nsuspicion seemed thickening, to speak the name.\n\n\"The girl? Why, ma'am, what could become of her? Not that I know\nexactly--only one knows they can but go from bad to worse, poor\ncreatures! God forgive me, if I am speaking too transiently of such\ndegraded women, who, after all, are a disgrace to our sex.\"\n\n\"Then you know nothing more about her?\" asked Jemima.\n\n\"I did hear that she had gone off with another gentleman that she met\nwith in Wales, but I'm sure I can't tell who told me.\"\n\nThere was a little pause. Jemima was pondering on all she had heard.\nSuddenly she felt that Mrs Pearson's eyes were upon her, watching\nher; not with curiosity, but with a newly-awakened intelligence;--and\nyet she must ask one more question; but she tried to ask it in an\nindifferent, careless tone, handling the bonnet while she spoke.\n\n\"How long is it since all this--all you have been telling me\nabout--happened?\" (Leonard was eight years old.)\n\n\"Why--let me see. It was before I was married, and I was married\nthree years, and poor dear Pearson has been deceased five--I should\nsay going on for nine years this summer. Blush roses would become\nyour complexion, perhaps, better than these lilacs,\" said she, as\nwith superficial observation she watched Jemima turning the bonnet\nround and round on her hand--the bonnet that her dizzy eyes did not\nsee.\n\n\"Thank you. It is very pretty. But I don't want a bonnet. I beg\nyour pardon for taking up your time.\" And with an abrupt bow to\nthe discomfited Mrs Pearson, she was out and away in the open air,\nthreading her way with instinctive energy along the crowded street.\nSuddenly she turned round, and went back to Mrs Pearson's with even\nmore rapidity than she had been walking away from the house.\n\n\"I have changed my mind,\" said she, as she came, breathless, up into\nthe show-room. \"I will take the bonnet. How much is it?\"\n\n\"Allow me to change the flowers; it can be done in an instant, and\nthen you can see if you would not prefer the roses; but with either\nfoliage it is a lovely little bonnet,\" said Mrs Pearson, holding it\nup admiringly on her hand.\n\n\"Oh! never mind the flowers--yes! change them to roses.\" And she\nstood by, agitated (Mrs Pearson thought with impatience), all the\ntime the milliner was making the alteration with skilful, busy haste.\n\n\"By the way,\" said Jemima, when she saw the last touches were being\ngiven, and that she must not delay executing the purpose which was\nthe real cause of her return--\"Papa, I am sure, would not like your\nconnecting Mrs Denbigh's name with such a--story as you have been\ntelling me.\"\n\n\"Oh dear! ma'am, I have too much respect for you all to think of\ndoing such a thing! Of course I know, ma'am, that it is not to be\ncast up to any lady that she is like anybody disreputable.\"\n\n\"But I would rather you did not name the likeness to any one,\" said\nJemima; \"not to any one. Don't tell any one the story you have told\nme this morning.\"\n\n\"Indeed, ma'am, I should never think of such a thing! My poor husband\ncould have borne witness that I am as close as the grave where there\nis anything to conceal.\"\n\n\"Oh dear!\" said Jemima, \"Mrs Pearson, there is nothing to conceal;\nonly you must not speak about it.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall not do it, ma'am; you may rest assured of me.\"\n\nThis time Jemima did not go towards home, but in the direction of\nthe outskirts of the town, on the hilly side. She had some dim\nrecollection of hearing her sisters ask if they might not go and\ninvite Leonard and his mother to tea; and how could she face Ruth,\nafter the conviction had taken possession of her heart that she, and\nthe sinful creature she had just heard of, were one and the same?\n\nIt was yet only the middle of the afternoon; the hours were early\nin the old-fashioned town of Eccleston. Soft white clouds had come\nslowly sailing up out of the west; the plain was flecked with thin\nfloating shadows, gently borne along by the westerly wind that was\nwaving the long grass in the hay-fields into alternate light and\nshade. Jemima went into one of these fields, lying by the side of\nthe upland road. She was stunned by the shock she had received.\nThe diver, leaving the green sward, smooth and known, where his\nfriends stand with their familiar smiling faces, admiring his glad\nbravery--the diver, down in an instant in the horrid depths of the\nsea, close to some strange, ghastly, lidless-eyed monster, can hardly\nmore feel his blood curdle at the near terror than did Jemima now.\nTwo hours ago--but a point of time on her mind's dial--she had never\nimagined that she should ever come in contact with any one who had\ncommitted open sin; she had never shaped her conviction into words\nand sentences, but still it was _there_, that all the respectable,\nall the family and religious circumstances of her life, would hedge\nher in, and guard her from ever encountering the great shock of\ncoming face to face with vice. Without being pharisaical in her\nestimation of herself, she had all a Pharisee's dread of publicans\nand sinners, and all a child's cowardliness--that cowardliness which\nprompts it to shut its eyes against the object of terror, rather\nthan acknowledge its existence with brave faith. Her father's often\nreiterated speeches had not been without their effect. He drew a\nclear line of partition, which separated mankind into two great\ngroups, to one of which, by the grace of God, he and his belonged;\nwhile the other was composed of those whom it was his duty to try and\nreform, and bring the whole force of his morality to bear upon, with\nlectures, admonitions, and exhortations--a duty to be performed,\nbecause it was a duty--but with very little of that Hope and Faith\nwhich is the Spirit that maketh alive. Jemima had rebelled against\nthese hard doctrines of her father's, but their frequent repetition\nhad had its effect, and led her to look upon those who had gone\nastray with shrinking, shuddering recoil, instead of with a pity so\nChrist-like as to have both wisdom and tenderness in it.\n\nAnd now she saw among her own familiar associates one, almost her\nhousefellow, who had been stained with that evil most repugnant to\nher womanly modesty, that would fain have ignored its existence\naltogether. She loathed the thought of meeting Ruth again. She\nwished that she could take her up, and put her down at a distance\nsomewhere--anywhere--where she might never see or hear of her more;\nnever be reminded, as she must be whenever she saw her, that such\nthings were in this sunny, bright, lark-singing earth, over which the\nblue dome of heaven bent softly down as Jemima sat in the hayfield\nthat June afternoon; her cheeks flushed and red, but her lips pale\nand compressed, and her eyes full of a heavy, angry sorrow. It was\nSaturday, and the people in that part of the country left their work\nan hour earlier on that day. By this, Jemima knew it must be growing\ntime for her to be at home. She had had so much of conflict in her\nown mind of late, that she had grown to dislike struggle, or speech,\nor explanation; and so strove to conform to times and hours much\nmore than she had done in happier days. But oh! how full of hate her\nheart was growing against the world! And oh! how she sickened at the\nthought of seeing Ruth! Who was to be trusted more, if Ruth--calm,\nmodest, delicate, dignified Ruth--had a memory blackened by sin?\n\nAs she went heavily along, the thought of Mr Farquhar came into\nher mind. It showed how terrible had been the stun, that he had\nbeen forgotten until now. With the thought of him came in her first\nmerciful feeling towards Ruth. This would never have been, had there\nbeen the least latent suspicion in Jemima's jealous mind that Ruth\nhad purposely done aught--looked a look--uttered a word--modulated a\ntone--for the sake of attracting. As Jemima recalled all the passages\nof their intercourse, she slowly confessed to herself how pure and\nsimple had been all Ruth's ways in relation to Mr Farquhar. It was\nnot merely that there had been no coquetting, but there had been\nsimple unconsciousness on Ruth's part, for so long a time after\nJemima had discovered Mr Farquhar's inclination for her; and when at\nlength she had slowly awakened to some perception of the state of his\nfeelings, there had been a modest, shrinking dignity of manner, not\nstartled, or emotional, or even timid, but pure, grave, and quiet;\nand this conduct of Ruth's, Jemima instinctively acknowledged to be\nof necessity transparent and sincere. Now, and here, there was no\nhypocrisy; but some time, somewhere, on the part of somebody, what\nhypocrisy, what lies must have been acted, if not absolutely spoken,\nbefore Ruth could have been received by them all as the sweet,\ngentle, girlish widow, which she remembered they had all believed\nMrs Denbigh to be when first she came among them! Could Mr and Miss\nBenson know? Could they be a party to the deceit? Not sufficiently\nacquainted with the world to understand how strong had been the\ntemptation to play the part they did, if they wished to give Ruth a\nchance, Jemima could not believe them guilty of such deceit as the\nknowledge of Mrs Denbigh's previous conduct would imply; and yet how\nit darkened the latter into a treacherous hypocrite, with a black\nsecret shut up in her soul for years--living in apparent confidence,\nand daily household familiarity with the Bensons for years, yet never\ntelling the remorse that ought to be corroding her heart! Who was\ntrue? Who was not? Who was good and pure? Who was not? The very\nfoundations of Jemima's belief in her mind were shaken.\n\nCould it be false? Could there be two Ruth Hiltons? She went over\nevery morsel of evidence. It could not be. She knew that Mrs\nDenbigh's former name had been Hilton. She had heard her speak\ncasually, but charily, of having lived in Fordham. She knew she had\nbeen in Wales but a short time before she made her appearance in\nEccleston. There was no doubt of the identity. Into the middle of\nJemima's pain and horror at the afternoon's discovery, there came a\nsense of the power which the knowledge of this secret gave her over\nRuth; but this was no relief, only an aggravation of the regret with\nwhich Jemima looked back on her state of ignorance. It was no wonder\nthat when she arrived at home, she was so oppressed with headache\nthat she had to go to bed directly.\n\n\"Quiet, mother! quiet, dear, dear mother\" (for she clung to the known\nand tried goodness of her mother more than ever now), \"that is all\nI want.\" And she was left to the stillness of her darkened room,\nthe blinds idly flapping to and fro in the soft evening breeze, and\nletting in the rustling sound of the branches which waved close to\nher window, and the thrush's gurgling warble, and the distant hum of\nthe busy town.\n\nHer jealousy was gone--she knew not how or where. She might shun and\nrecoil from Ruth, but she now thought that she could never more be\njealous of her. In her pride of innocence, she felt almost ashamed\nthat such a feeling could have had existence. Could Mr Farquhar\nhesitate between her own self and one who-- No! she could not name\nwhat Ruth had been, even in thought. And yet he might never know,\nso fair a seeming did her rival wear. Oh! for one ray of God's\nholy light to know what was seeming, and what was truth, in this\ntraitorous hollow earth! It might be--she used to think such things\npossible, before sorrow had embittered her--that Ruth had worked her\nway through the deep purgatory of repentance up to something like\npurity again; God only knew! If her present goodness was real--if,\nafter having striven back thus far on the heights, a fellow-woman\nwas to throw her down into some terrible depth with her unkind,\nincontinent tongue, that would be too cruel! And yet, if--there was\nsuch woeful uncertainty and deceit somewhere--if Ruth-- No! that\nJemima, with noble candour, admitted was impossible. Whatever Ruth\nhad been, she was good, and to be respected as such, now. It did not\nfollow that Jemima was to preserve the secret always; she doubted her\nown power to do so, if Mr Farquhar came home again, and were still\nconstant in his admiration of Mrs Denbigh, and if Mrs Denbigh gave\nhim any--the least encouragement. But this last she thought, from\nwhat she knew of Ruth's character, was impossible. Only, what was\nimpossible after this afternoon's discovery? At any rate, she would\nwatch and wait. Come what might, Ruth was in her power. And, strange\nto say, this last certainty gave Jemima a kind of protecting,\nalmost pitying, feeling for Ruth. Her horror at the wrong was not\ndiminished; but the more she thought of the struggles that the\nwrong-doer must have made to extricate herself, the more she felt how\ncruel it would be to baffle all by revealing what had been. But for\nher sisters' sake she had a duty to perform; she must watch Ruth. For\nher love's sake she could not have helped watching; but she was too\nmuch stunned to recognise the force of her love, while duty seemed\nthe only stable thing to cling to. For the present she would neither\nmeddle nor mar in Ruth's course of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nMr Bradshaw's Virtuous Indignation\n\n\nSo it was that Jemima no longer avoided Ruth, nor manifested by\nword or look the dislike which for a long time she had been scarce\nconcealing. Ruth could not help noticing that Jemima always sought to\nbe in her presence while she was at Mr Bradshaw's house; either when\ndaily teaching Mary and Elizabeth, or when she came as an occasional\nvisitor with Mr and Miss Benson, or by herself. Up to this time\nJemima had used no gentle skill to conceal the abruptness with which\nshe would leave the room rather than that Ruth and she should be\nbrought into contact--rather than that it should fall to her lot to\nentertain Ruth during any part of the evening. It was months since\nJemima had left off sitting in the schoolroom, as had been her wont\nduring the first few years of Ruth's governess-ship. Now, each\nmorning Miss Bradshaw seated herself at a little round table in the\nwindow, at her work, or at her writing; but whether she sewed, or\nwrote, or read, Ruth felt that she was always watching--watching. At\nfirst Ruth had welcomed all these changes in habit and behaviour,\nas giving her a chance, she thought, by some patient waiting or\nsome opportune show of enduring, constant love, to regain her lost\nfriend's regard; but by-and-by the icy chillness, immovable and grey,\nstruck more to her heart than many sudden words of unkindness could\nhave done. They might be attributed to the hot impulses of a hasty\ntemper--to the vehement anger of an accuser; but this measured manner\nwas the conscious result of some deep-seated feeling; this cold\nsternness befitted the calm implacability of some severe judge. The\nwatching, which Ruth felt was ever upon her, made her unconsciously\nshiver, as you would if you saw that the passionless eyes of the dead\nwere visibly gazing upon you. Her very being shrivelled and parched\nup in Jemima's presence, as if blown upon by a bitter, keen, east\nwind.\n\nJemima bent every power she possessed upon the one object of\nascertaining what Ruth really was. Sometimes the strain was very\npainful; the constant tension made her soul weary; and she moaned\naloud, and upbraided circumstance (she dared not go higher--to the\nMaker of circumstance) for having deprived her of her unsuspicious\nhappy ignorance.\n\nThings were in this state when Mr Richard Bradshaw came on his annual\nhome visit. He was to remain another year in London, and then to\nreturn and be admitted into the firm. After he had been a week at\nhome, he grew tired of the monotonous regularity of his father's\nhousehold, and began to complain of it to Jemima.\n\n\"I wish Farquhar were at home. Though he is such a stiff, quiet old\nfellow, his coming in in the evenings makes a change. What has become\nof the Millses? They used to drink tea with us sometimes, formerly.\"\n\n\"Oh! papa and Mr Mills took opposite sides at the election, and we\nhave never visited since. I don't think they are any great loss.\"\n\n\"Anybody is a loss--the stupidest bore that ever was would be a\nblessing, if he only would come in sometimes.\"\n\n\"Mr and Miss Benson have drank tea here twice since you came.\"\n\n\"Come, that's capital! Apropos of stupid bores, you talk of the\nBensons. I did not think you had so much discrimination, my little\nsister.\"\n\nJemima looked up in surprise; and then reddened angrily.\n\n\"I never meant to say a word against Mr or Miss Benson, and that you\nknow quite well, Dick.\"\n\n\"Never mind! I won't tell tales. They are stupid old fogeys, but they\nare better than nobody, especially as that handsome governess of the\ngirls always comes with them to be looked at.\"\n\nThere was a little pause; Richard broke it by saying:\n\n\"Do you know, Mimie, I've a notion, if she plays her cards well, she\nmay hook Farquhar!\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Jemima, shortly, though she knew quite well.\n\n\"Mrs Denbigh, to be sure. We were talking of her, you know. Farquhar\nasked me to dine with him at his hotel as he passed through town,\nand--I'd my own reasons for going and trying to creep up his\nsleeve--I wanted him to tip me, as he used to do.\"\n\n\"For shame! Dick,\" burst in Jemima.\n\n\"Well! well! not tip me exactly, but lend me some money. The governor\nkeeps me so deucedly short.\"\n\n\"Why! it was only yesterday, when my father was speaking about your\nexpenses, and your allowance, I heard you say that you'd more than\nyou knew how to spend.\"\n\n\"Don't you see that was the perfection of art? If my father had\nthought me extravagant, he would have kept me in with a tight rein;\nas it is, I'm in great hopes of a handsome addition, and I can tell\nyou it's needed. If my father had given me what I ought to have had\nat first, I should not have been driven to the speculations and\nmesses I've got into.\"\n\n\"What speculations? What messes?\" asked Jemima, with anxious\neagerness.\n\n\"Oh! messes was not the right word. Speculations hardly was; for\nthey are sure to turn out well, and then I shall surprise my father\nwith my riches.\" He saw that he had gone a little too far in his\nconfidence, and was trying to draw in.\n\n\"But, what do you mean? Do explain it to me.\"\n\n\"Never you trouble your head about my business, my dear. Women can't\nunderstand the share-market, and such things. Don't think I've\nforgotten the awful blunders you made when you tried to read the\nstate of the money-market aloud to my father, that night when he\nhad lost his spectacles. What were we talking of? Oh! of Farquhar\nand pretty Mrs Denbigh. Yes! I soon found out that was the subject\nmy gentleman liked me to dwell on. He did not talk about her much\nhimself, but his eyes sparkled when I told him what enthusiastic\nletters Polly and Elizabeth wrote about her. How old d'ye think she\nis?\"\n\n\"I know!\" said Jemima. \"At least, I heard her age spoken\nabout, amongst other things, when first she came. She will be\nfive-and-twenty this autumn.\"\n\n\"And Farquhar is forty, if he is a day. She's young, too, to have\nsuch a boy as Leonard; younger-looking, or full as young-looking as\nshe is! I tell you what, Mimie, she looks younger than you. How old\nare you? Three-and-twenty, ain't it?\"\n\n\"Last March,\" replied Jemima.\n\n\"You'll have to make haste and pick up somebody, if you're losing\nyour good looks at this rate. Why, Jemima, I thought you had a good\nchance of Farquhar a year or two ago. How come you to have lost him?\nI'd far rather you'd had him than that proud, haughty Mrs Denbigh,\nwho flashes her great grey eyes upon me if ever I dare to pay her a\ncompliment. She ought to think it an honour that I take that much\nnotice of her. Besides, Farquhar is rich, and it's keeping the\nbusiness of the firm in one's own family; and if he marries Mrs\nDenbigh she will be sure to be wanting Leonard in when he's of age,\nand I won't have that. Have a try for Farquhar, Mimie! Ten to one\nit's not too late. I wish I'd brought you a pink bonnet down. You go\nabout so dowdy--so careless of how you look.\"\n\n\"If Mr Farquhar has not liked me as I am,\" said Jemima, choking, \"I\ndon't want to owe him to a pink bonnet.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! I don't like to have my sisters' governess stealing a\nmarch on my sister. I tell you Farquhar is worth trying for. If\nyou'll wear the pink bonnet I'll give it you, and I'll back you\nagainst Mrs Denbigh. I think you might have done something with\n'our member,' as my father calls him, when you had him so long\nin the house. But, altogether, I should like Farquhar best for a\nbrother-in-law. By the way, have you heard down here that Donne is\ngoing to be married? I heard of it in town, just before I left, from\na man that was good authority. Some Sir Thomas Campbell's seventh\ndaughter: a girl without a penny; father ruined himself by gambling,\nand obliged to live abroad. But Donne is not a man to care for any\nobstacle, from all accounts, when once he has taken a fancy. It was\nlove at first sight, they say. I believe he did not know of her\nexistence a month ago.\"\n\n\"No! we have not heard of it,\" replied Jemima. \"My father will like\nto know; tell it him;\" continued she, as she was leaving the room, to\nbe alone, in order to still her habitual agitation whenever she heard\nMr Farquhar and Ruth coupled together.\n\nMr Farquhar came home the day before Richard Bradshaw left for town.\nHe dropped in after tea at the Bradshaws'; he was evidently\ndisappointed to see none but the family there, and looked round\nwhenever the door opened.\n\n\"Look! look!\" said Dick to his sister. \"I wanted to make sure of\nhis coming in to-night, to save me my father's parting exhortations\nagainst the temptations of the world (as if I did not know much more\nof the world than he does!), so I used a spell I thought would prove\nefficacious; I told him that we should be by ourselves, with the\nexception of Mrs Denbigh, and look how he is expecting her to come\nin!\"\n\nJemima did see; did understand. She understood, too, why certain\npackets were put carefully on one side, apart from the rest of the\npurchases of Swiss toys and jewellery, by which Mr Farquhar proved\nthat none of Mr Bradshaw's family had been forgotten by him during\nhis absence. Before the end of the evening, she was very conscious\nthat her sore heart had not forgotten how to be jealous. Her brother\ndid not allow a word, a look, or an incident, which might be supposed\non Mr Farquhar's side to refer to Ruth, to pass unnoticed; he\npointed out all to his sister, never dreaming of the torture he was\ninflicting, only anxious to prove his own extreme penetration. At\nlength Jemima could stand it no longer, and left the room. She went\ninto the schoolroom, where the shutters were not closed, as it only\nlooked into the garden. She opened the window, to let the cool night\nair blow in on her hot cheeks. The clouds were hurrying over the\nmoon's face in a tempestuous and unstable manner, making all things\nseem unreal; now clear out in its bright light, now trembling and\nquivering in shadow. The pain at her heart seemed to make Jemima's\nbrain grow dull; she laid her head on her arms, which rested on the\nwindow-sill, and grew dizzy with the sick weary notion that the earth\nwas wandering lawless and aimless through the heavens, where all\nseemed one tossed and whirling wrack of clouds. It was a waking\nnightmare, from the uneasy heaviness of which she was thankful to be\nroused by Dick's entrance.\n\n\"What, you are here, are you? I have been looking everywhere for you.\nI wanted to ask you if you have any spare money you could lend me for\na few weeks?\"\n\n\"How much do you want?\" asked Jemima, in a dull, hopeless voice.\n\n\"Oh! the more the better. But I should be glad of any trifle, I am\nkept so confoundedly short.\"\n\nWhen Jemima returned with her little store, even her careless,\nselfish brother was struck by the wanness of her face, lighted by the\nbed-candle she carried.\n\n\"Come, Mimie, don't give it up. If I were you, I would have a good\ntry against Mrs Denbigh. I'll send you the bonnet as soon as ever\nI get back to town, and you pluck up a spirit, and I'll back you\nagainst her even yet.\"\n\nIt seemed to Jemima strange--and yet only a fitting part of this\nstrange, chaotic world--to find that her brother, who was the last\nperson to whom she could have given her confidence in her own family,\nand almost the last person of her acquaintance to whom she could look\nfor real help and sympathy, should have been the only one to hit upon\nthe secret of her love. And the idea passed away from his mind as\nquickly as all ideas not bearing upon his own self-interests did.\n\nThe night, the sleepless night, was so crowded and haunted by\nmiserable images, that she longed for day; and when day came, with\nits stinging realities, she wearied and grew sick for the solitude of\nnight. For the next week, she seemed to see and hear nothing but what\nconfirmed the idea of Mr Farquhar's decided attachment to Ruth. Even\nher mother spoke of it as a thing which was impending, and which she\nwondered how Mr Bradshaw would like; for his approval or disapproval\nwas the standard by which she measured all things.\n\n\"Oh! merciful God,\" prayed Jemima, in the dead silence of the night,\n\"the strain is too great--I cannot bear it longer--my life--my\nlove--the very essence of me, which is myself through time and\neternity; and on the other side there is all-pitying Charity. If she\nhad not been what she is--if she had shown any sign of triumph--any\nknowledge of her prize--if she had made any effort to gain his dear\nheart, I must have given way long ago, and taunted her, even if I did\nnot tell others--taunted her, even though I sank down to the pit the\nnext moment.\n\n\"The temptation is too strong for me. Oh Lord! where is Thy peace\nthat I believed in, in my childhood?--that I hear people speaking\nof now, as if it hushed up the troubles of life, and had not to be\nsought for--sought for, as with tears of blood!\"\n\nThere was no sound nor sight in answer to this wild imploring cry,\nwhich Jemima half thought must force out a sign from Heaven. But\nthere was a dawn stealing on through the darkness of her night.\n\nIt was glorious weather for the end of August. The nights were as\nfull of light as the days--everywhere, save in the low dusky meadows\nby the river-side, where the mists rose and blended the pale sky with\nthe lands below. Unknowing of the care and trouble around them, Mary\nand Elizabeth exulted in the weather, and saw some new glory in every\ntouch of the year's decay. They were clamorous for an expedition\nto the hills, before the calm stillness of the autumn should be\ndisturbed by storms. They gained permission to go on the next\nWednesday--the next half-holiday. They had won their mother over to\nconsent to a full holiday, but their father would not hear of it. Mrs\nBradshaw had proposed an early dinner, but the idea was scouted at by\nthe girls. What would the expedition be worth if they did not carry\ntheir dinners with them in baskets? Anything out of a basket, and\neaten in the open air, was worth twenty times as much as the most\nsumptuous meal in the house. So the baskets were packed up, while\nMrs Bradshaw wailed over probable colds to be caught from sitting on\nthe damp ground. Ruth and Leonard were to go; they four. Jemima had\nrefused all invitations to make one of the party; and yet she had a\nhalf-sympathy with her sisters' joy--a sort of longing, lingering\nlook back to the time when she too would have revelled in the\nprospect that lay before them. They, too, would grow up, and suffer;\nthough now they played, regardless of their doom.\n\nThe morning was bright and glorious; just cloud enough, as some one\nsaid, to make the distant plain look beautiful from the hills, with\nits floating shadows passing over the golden corn-fields. Leonard\nwas to join them at twelve, when his lessons with Mr Benson, and the\ngirls' with their masters, should be over. Ruth took off her bonnet,\nand folded her shawl with her usual dainty, careful neatness, and\nlaid them aside in a corner of the room to be in readiness. She\ntried to forget the pleasure she always anticipated from a long walk\ntowards the hills, while the morning's work went on; but she showed\nenough of sympathy to make the girls cling round her with many a\ncaress of joyous love. Everything was beautiful in their eyes; from\nthe shadows of the quivering leaves on the wall to the glittering\nbeads of dew, not yet absorbed by the sun, which decked the gossamer\nweb in the vine outside the window. Eleven o'clock struck. The Latin\nmaster went away, wondering much at the radiant faces of his pupils,\nand thinking that it was only very young people who could take such\npleasure in the \"Delectus.\" Ruth said, \"Now, do let us try to be very\nsteady this next hour,\" and Mary pulled back Ruth's head, and gave\nthe pretty budding mouth a kiss. They sat down to work, while Mrs\nDenbigh read aloud. A fresh sun-gleam burst into the room, and they\nlooked at each other with glad, anticipating eyes.\n\nJemima came in, ostensibly to seek for a book, but really from that\nsort of restless weariness of any one place or employment, which had\ntaken possession of her since Mr Farquhar's return. She stood before\nthe bookcase in the recess, languidly passing over the titles in\nsearch of the one she wanted. Ruth's voice lost a tone or two of its\npeacefulness, and her eyes looked more dim and anxious at Jemima's\npresence. She wondered in her heart if she dared to ask Miss Bradshaw\nto accompany them in their expedition. Eighteen months ago she would\nhave urged it on her friend with soft, loving entreaty; now she was\nafraid even to propose it as a hard possibility; everything she did\nor said was taken so wrongly--seemed to add to the old dislike, or\nthe later stony contempt with which Miss Bradshaw had regarded her.\nWhile they were in this way Mr Bradshaw came into the room. His\nentrance--his being at home at all at this time--was so unusual\na thing, that the reading was instantly stopped; and all four\ninvoluntarily looked at him, as if expecting some explanation of his\nunusual proceeding.\n\nHis face was almost purple with suppressed agitation.\n\n\"Mary and Elizabeth, leave the room. Don't stay to pack up your\nbooks. Leave the room, I say!\" He spoke with trembling anger, and the\nfrightened girls obeyed without a word. A cloud passing over the sun\ncast a cold gloom into the room which was late so bright and beaming;\nbut, by equalising the light, it took away the dark shadow from the\nplace where Jemima had been standing, and her figure caught her\nfather's eye.\n\n\"Leave the room, Jemima,\" said he.\n\n\"Why, father?\" replied she, in an opposition that was strange even to\nherself, but which was prompted by the sullen passion which seethed\nbelow the stagnant surface of her life, and which sought a vent in\ndefiance. She maintained her ground, facing round upon her father,\nand Ruth--Ruth, who had risen, and stood trembling, shaking, a\nlightning-fear having shown her the precipice on which she stood. It\nwas of no use; no quiet, innocent life--no profound silence, even to\nher own heart, as to the Past; the old offence could never be drowned\nin the Deep; but thus, when all was calm on the great, broad, sunny\nsea, it rose to the surface, and faced her with its unclosed eyes and\nits ghastly countenance. The blood bubbled up to her brain, and made\nsuch a sound there, as of boiling waters, that she did not hear the\nwords which Mr Bradshaw first spoke; indeed, his speech was broken\nand disjointed by intense passion. But she needed not to hear; she\nknew. As she rose up at first, so she stood now--numb and helpless.\nWhen her ears heard again (as if the sounds were drawing nearer, and\nbecoming more distinct, from some faint, vague distance of space),\nMr Bradshaw was saying, \"If there be one sin I hate--I utterly\nloathe--more than all others, it is wantonness. It includes all\nother sins. It is but of a piece that you should have come with your\nsickly, hypocritical face, imposing upon us all. I trust Benson did\nnot know of it--for his own sake, I trust not. Before God, if he got\nyou into my house on false pretences, he shall find his charity at\nother men's expense shall cost him dear--you--the common talk of\nEccleston for your profligacy--\" He was absolutely choked by his\nboiling indignation. Ruth stood speechless, motionless. Her head\ndrooped a little forward, her eyes were more than half veiled by\nthe large quivering lids, her arms hung down straight and heavy. At\nlast she heaved the weight off her heart enough to say, in a faint,\nmoaning voice, speaking with infinite difficulty:\n\n\"I was so young.\"\n\n\"The more depraved, the more disgusting you,\" Mr Bradshaw exclaimed,\nalmost glad that the woman, unresisting so long, should now begin to\nresist. But to his surprise (for in his anger he had forgotten her\npresence) Jemima moved forwards, and said, \"Father!\"\n\n\"You hold your tongue, Jemima. You have grown more and more\ninsolent--more and more disobedient every day. I now know who to\nthank for it. When such a woman came into my family there is no\nwonder at any corruption--any evil--any defilement--\"\n\n\"Father!\"\n\n\"Not a word! If, in your disobedience, you choose to stay and hear\nwhat no modest young woman would put herself in the way of hearing,\nyou shall be silent when I bid you. The only good you can gain is in\nthe way of warning. Look at that woman\" (indicating Ruth, who moved\nher drooping head a little on one side, as if by such motion she\ncould avert the pitiless pointing--her face growing whiter and whiter\nstill every instant)--\"look at that woman, I say--corrupt long before\nshe was your age--hypocrite for years! If ever you, or any child of\nmine, cared for her, shake her off from you, as St Paul shook off\nthe viper--even into the fire.\" He stopped for very want of breath.\nJemima, all flushed and panting, went up and stood side by side with\nwan Ruth. She took the cold, dead hand which hung next to her in her\nwarm convulsive grasp, and holding it so tight that it was blue and\ndiscoloured for days, she spoke out beyond all power of restraint\nfrom her father.\n\n\"Father, I will speak. I will not keep silence. I will bear witness\nto Ruth. I have hated her--so keenly, may God forgive me! but you\nmay know, from that, that my witness is true. I have hated her,\nand my hatred was only quenched into contempt--not contempt now,\ndear Ruth--dear Ruth\"--(this was spoken with infinite softness and\ntenderness, and in spite of her father's fierce eyes and passionate\ngesture)--\"I heard what you have learnt now, father, weeks and weeks\nago--a year it may be, all time of late has been so long; and I\nshuddered up from her and from her sin; and I might have spoken of\nit, and told it there and then, if I had not been afraid that it was\nfrom no good motive I should act in so doing, but to gain a way to\nthe desire of my own jealous heart. Yes, father, to show you what a\nwitness I am for Ruth, I will own that I was stabbed to the heart\nwith jealousy; some one--some one cared for Ruth that--oh, father!\nspare me saying all.\" Her face was double-dyed with crimson blushes,\nand she paused for one moment--no more.\n\n\"I watched her, and I watched her with my wild-beast eyes. If I had\nseen one paltering with duty--if I had witnessed one flickering\nshadow of untruth in word or action--if, more than all things, my\nwoman's instinct had ever been conscious of the faintest speck of\nimpurity in thought, or word, or look, my old hate would have flamed\nout with the flame of hell! my contempt would have turned to loathing\ndisgust, instead of my being full of pity, and the stirrings of\nnew-awakened love, and most true respect. Father, I have borne my\nwitness!\"\n\n\"And I will tell you how much your witness is worth,\" said her\nfather, beginning low, that his pent-up wrath might have room to\nswell out. \"It only convinces me more and more how deep is the\ncorruption this wanton has spread in my family. She has come amongst\nus with her innocent seeming, and spread her nets well and skilfully.\nShe has turned right into wrong, and wrong into right, and taught you\nall to be uncertain whether there be any such thing as Vice in the\nworld, or whether it ought not to be looked upon as Virtue. She has\nled you to the brink of the deep pit, ready for the first chance\ncircumstance to push you in. And I trusted her--I trusted her--I\nwelcomed her.\"\n\n\"I have done very wrong,\" murmured Ruth, but so low, that perhaps he\ndid not hear her, for he went on, lashing himself up.\n\n\"I welcomed her. I was duped into allowing her bastard--(I sicken at\nthe thought of it)--\"\n\nAt the mention of Leonard, Ruth lifted up her eyes for the first time\nsince the conversation began, the pupils dilating, as if she were\njust becoming aware of some new agony in store for her. I have seen\nsuch a look of terror on a poor dumb animal's countenance, and once\nor twice on human faces. I pray I may never see it again on either!\nJemima felt the hand she held in her strong grasp writhe itself free.\nRuth spread her arms before her, clasping and lacing her fingers\ntogether, her head thrown a little back, as if in intensest\nsuffering.\n\nMr Bradshaw went on:\n\n\"That very child and heir of shame to associate with my own innocent\nchildren! I trust they are not contaminated.\"\n\n\"I cannot bear it--I cannot bear it!\" were the words wrung out of\nRuth.\n\n\"Cannot bear it! cannot bear it!\" he repeated. \"You must bear it,\nmadam. Do you suppose your child is to be exempt from the penalties\nof his birth? Do you suppose that he alone is to be saved from the\nupbraiding scoff? Do you suppose that he is ever to rank with other\nboys, who are not stained and marked with sin from their birth? Every\ncreature in Eccleston may know what he is; do you think they will\nspare him their scorn? 'Cannot bear it,' indeed! Before you went\ninto your sin, you should have thought whether you could bear the\nconsequences or not--have had some idea how far your offspring would\nbe degraded and scouted, till the best thing that could happen to\nhim would be for him to be lost to all sense of shame, dead to all\nknowledge of guilt, for his mother's sake.\"\n\nRuth spoke out. She stood like a wild creature at bay, past fear now.\n\"I appeal to God against such a doom for my child. I appeal to God to\nhelp me. I am a mother, and as such I cry to God for help--for help\nto keep my boy in His pitying sight, and to bring him up in His holy\nfear. Let the shame fall on me! I have deserved it, but he--he is so\ninnocent and good.\"\n\nRuth had caught up her shawl, and was tying on her bonnet with her\ntrembling hands. What if Leonard was hearing of her shame from common\nreport? What would be the mysterious shock of the intelligence? She\nmust face him, and see the look in his eyes, before she knew whether\nhe recoiled from her; he might have his heart turned to hate her, by\ntheir cruel jeers.\n\nJemima stood by, dumb and pitying. Her sorrow was past her power. She\nhelped in arranging the dress, with one or two gentle touches, which\nwere hardly felt by Ruth, but which called out all Mr Bradshaw's\nire afresh; he absolutely took her by the shoulders and turned her\nby force out of the room. In the hall, and along the stairs, her\npassionate woeful crying was heard. The sound only concentrated Mr\nBradshaw's anger on Ruth. He held the street-door open wide, and\nsaid, between his teeth, \"If ever you, or your bastard, darken this\ndoor again, I will have you both turned out by the police!\"\n\nHe need not have added this, if he had seen Ruth's face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nPreparing to Stand on the Truth\n\n\nAs Ruth went along the accustomed streets, every sight and every\nsound seemed to bear a new meaning, and each and all to have some\nreference to her boy's disgrace. She held her head down, and scudded\nalong dizzy with fear, lest some word should have told him what she\nhad been, and what he was, before she could reach him. It was a wild,\nunreasoning fear, but it took hold of her as strongly as if it had\nbeen well founded. And, indeed, the secret whispered by Mrs Pearson,\nwhose curiosity and suspicion had been excited by Jemima's manner,\nand confirmed since by many a little corroborating circumstance, had\nspread abroad, and was known to most of the gossips in Eccleston\nbefore it reached Mr Bradshaw's ears.\n\nAs Ruth came up to the door of the Chapel-house, it was opened, and\nLeonard came out, bright and hopeful as the morning, his face radiant\nat the prospect of the happy day before him. He was dressed in the\nclothes it had been such a pleasant pride to her to make for him. He\nhad the dark blue ribbon tied round his neck that she had left out\nfor him that very morning, with a smiling thought of how it would\nset off his brown, handsome face. She caught him by the hand as they\nmet, and turned him, with his face homewards, without a word. Her\nlooks, her rushing movement, her silence, awed him; and although he\nwondered, he did not stay to ask why she did so. The door was on the\nlatch; she opened it, and only said, \"Upstairs,\" in a hoarse whisper.\nUp they went into her own room. She drew him in, and bolted the door;\nand then, sitting down, she placed him (she had never let go of him)\nbefore her, holding him with her hands on each of his shoulders, and\ngazing into his face with a woeful look of the agony that could not\nfind vent in words. At last she tried to speak; she tried with strong\nbodily effort, almost amounting to convulsion. But the words would\nnot come; it was not till she saw the absolute terror depicted on\nhis face that she found utterance; and then the sight of that terror\nchanged the words from what she meant them to have been. She drew him\nto her, and laid her head upon his shoulder; hiding her face even\nthere.\n\n\"My poor, poor boy! my poor, poor darling! Oh! would that I had\ndied--I had died, in my innocent girlhood!\"\n\n\"Mother! mother!\" sobbed Leonard. \"What is the matter? Why do you\nlook so wild and ill? Why do you call me your 'poor boy'? Are we not\ngoing to Scaurside-hill? I don't much mind it, mother; only please\ndon't gasp and quiver so. Dearest mother, are you ill? Let me call\nAunt Faith!\"\n\nRuth lifted herself up, and put away the hair that had fallen\nover and was blinding her eyes. She looked at him with intense\nwistfulness.\n\n\"Kiss me, Leonard!\" said she--\"kiss me, my darling, once more in the\nold way!\" Leonard threw himself into her arms and hugged her with all\nhis force, and their lips clung together as in the kiss given to the\ndying.\n\n\"Leonard!\" said she at length, holding him away from her, and nerving\nherself up to tell him all by one spasmodic effort--\"listen to me.\"\nThe boy stood breathless and still, gazing at her. On her impetuous\ntransit from Mr Bradshaw's to the Chapel-house, her wild, desperate\nthought had been that she would call herself by every violent,\ncoarse name which the world might give her--that Leonard should hear\nthose words applied to his mother first from her own lips; but the\ninfluence of his presence--for he was a holy and sacred creature in\nher eyes, and this point remained steadfast, though all the rest were\nupheaved--subdued her; and now it seemed as if she could not find\nwords fine enough, and pure enough, to convey the truth that he must\nlearn, and should learn from no tongue but hers.\n\n\"Leonard--when I was very young I did very wrong. I think God, who\nknows all, will judge me more tenderly than men--but I did wrong in a\nway which you cannot understand yet\" (she saw the red flush come into\nhis cheek, and it stung her as the first token of that shame which\nwas to be his portion through life)--\"in a way people never forget,\nnever forgive. You will hear me called the hardest names that ever\ncan be thrown at women--I have been, to-day; and, my child, you\nmust bear it patiently, because they will be partly true. Never get\nconfused, by your love for me, into thinking that what I did was\nright.--Where was I?\" said she, suddenly faltering, and forgetting\nall she had said and all she had got to say; and then, seeing\nLeonard's face of wonder, and burning shame and indignation, she went\non more rapidly, as fearing lest her strength should fail before she\nhad ended.\n\n\"And, Leonard,\" continued she, in a trembling, sad voice, \"this is\nnot all. The punishment of punishments lies awaiting me still. It is\nto see you suffer for my wrongdoing. Yes, darling! they will speak\nshameful things of you, poor innocent child! as well as of me, who\nam guilty. They will throw it in your teeth through life, that your\nmother was never married--was not married when you were born--\"\n\n\"Were not you married? Are not you a widow?\" asked he abruptly, for\nthe first time getting anything like a clear idea of the real state\nof the case.\n\n\"No! May God forgive me, and help me!\" exclaimed she, as she saw a\nstrange look of repugnance cloud over the boy's face, and felt a\nslight motion on his part to extricate himself from her hold. It\nwas as slight, as transient as it could be--over in an instant. But\nshe had taken her hands away, and covered up her face with them as\nquickly--covered up her face in shame before her child; and in the\nbitterness of her heart she was wailing out, \"Oh, would to God I had\ndied--that I had died as a baby--that I had died as a little baby\nhanging at my mother's breast!\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said Leonard, timidly putting his hand on her arm; but she\nshrunk from him, and continued her low, passionate wailing. \"Mother,\"\nsaid he, after a pause, coming nearer, though she saw it not--\"mammy\ndarling,\" said he, using the caressing name, which he had been trying\nto drop as not sufficiently manly, \"mammy, my own, own dear, dear,\ndarling mother, I don't believe them--I don't, I don't, I don't, I\ndon't!\" He broke out into a wild burst of crying as he said this. In\na moment her arms were round the poor boy, and she was hushing him\nup like a baby on her bosom. \"Hush, Leonard! Leonard, be still, my\nchild! I have been too sudden with you!--I have done you harm--oh!\nI have done you nothing but harm,\" cried she, in a tone of bitter\nself-reproach.\n\n\"No, mother,\" said he, stopping his tears, and his eyes blazing out\nwith earnestness; \"there never was such a mother as you have been to\nme, and I won't believe any one who says it. I won't; and I'll knock\nthem down if they say it again, I will!\" He clenched his fist, with a\nfierce, defiant look on his face.\n\n\"You forget, my child,\" said Ruth, in the sweetest, saddest tone that\never was heard, \"I said it of myself; I said it because it was true.\"\nLeonard threw his arms tight round her, and hid his face against her\nbosom. She felt him pant there like some hunted creature. She had no\nsoothing comfort to give him. \"Oh, that she and he lay dead!\"\n\nAt last, exhausted, he lay so still and motionless, that she feared\nto look. She wanted him to speak, yet dreaded his first words.\nShe kissed his hair, his head, his very clothes, murmuring low,\ninarticulate, moaning sounds.\n\n\"Leonard,\" said she, \"Leonard, look up at me! Leonard, look up!\" But\nhe only clung the closer, and hid his face the more.\n\n\"My boy!\" said she, \"what can I do or say? If I tell you never to\nmind it--that it is nothing--I tell you false. It is a bitter shame\nand a sorrow that I have drawn down upon you. A shame, Leonard,\nbecause of me, your mother; but, Leonard, it is no disgrace or\nlowering of you in the eyes of God.\" She spoke now as if she had\nfound the clue which might lead him to rest and strength at last.\n\"Remember that, always. Remember that, when the time of trial\ncomes--and it seems a hard and cruel thing that you should be\ncalled reproachful names by men, and all for what was no fault of\nyours--remember God's pity and God's justice; and though my sin shall\nhave made you an outcast in the world--oh, my child, my child!\"--(she\nfelt him kiss her, as if mutely trying to comfort her--it gave her\nstrength to go on)--\"remember, darling of my heart, it is only your\nown sin that can make you an outcast from God.\"\n\nShe grew so faint that her hold of him relaxed. He looked up\naffrighted. He brought her water--he threw it over her; in his terror\nat the notion that she was going to die and leave him, he called her\nby every fond name, imploring her to open her eyes.\n\nWhen she partially recovered, he helped her to the bed, on which\nshe lay still, wan and death-like. She almost hoped the swoon that\nhung around her might be Death, and in that imagination she opened\nher eyes to take a last look at her boy. She saw him pale and\nterror-stricken; and pity for his affright roused her, and made her\nforget herself in the wish that he should not see her death, if she\nwere indeed dying.\n\n\"Go to Aunt Faith!\" whispered she; \"I am weary, and want sleep.\"\n\nLeonard arose slowly and reluctantly. She tried to smile upon him,\nthat what she thought would be her last look might dwell in his\nremembrance as tender and strong; she watched him to the door; she\nsaw him hesitate, and return to her. He came back to her, and said in\na timid, apprehensive tone:\n\n\"Mother--will _they_ speak to me about--it?\"\n\nRuth closed her eyes, that they might not express the agony she felt,\nlike a sharp knife, at this question. Leonard had asked it with a\nchild's desire of avoiding painful and mysterious topics,--from no\npersonal sense of shame as she understood it, shame beginning thus\nearly, thus instantaneously.\n\n\"No,\" she replied. \"You may be sure they will not.\"\n\nSo he went. But now she would have been thankful for the\nunconsciousness of fainting; that one little speech bore so much\nmeaning to her hot, irritable brain. Mr and Miss Benson, all in their\nhouse, would never speak to the boy--but in his home alone would he\nbe safe from what he had already learnt to dread. Every form in which\nshame and opprobrium could overwhelm her darling, haunted her. She\nhad been exercising strong self-control for his sake ever since she\nhad met him at the house-door; there was now a reaction. His presence\nhad kept her mind on its perfect balance. When that was withdrawn,\nthe effect of the strain of power was felt. And athwart the\nfever-mists that arose to obscure her judgment, all sorts of\nwill-o'-the-wisp plans flittered before her; tempting her to this and\nthat course of action--to anything rather than patient endurance--to\nrelieve her present state of misery by some sudden spasmodic effort,\nthat took the semblance of being wise and right. Gradually all\nher desires, all her longing, settled themselves on one point.\nWhat had she done--what could she do, to Leonard, but evil? If she\nwere away, and gone no one knew where--lost in mystery, as if she\nwere dead--perhaps the cruel hearts might relent, and show pity\non Leonard; while her perpetual presence would but call up the\nremembrance of his birth. Thus she reasoned in her hot, dull brain;\nand shaped her plans in accordance.\n\nLeonard stole downstairs noiselessly. He listened to find some\nquiet place where he could hide himself. The house was very still.\nMiss Benson thought the purposed expedition had taken place, and\nnever dreamed but that Ruth and Leonard were on distant, sunny\nScaurside-hill; and after a very early dinner, she had set out to\ndrink tea with a farmer's wife who lived in the country two or three\nmiles off. Mr Benson meant to have gone with her; but while they were\nat dinner, he had received an unusually authoritative note from Mr\nBradshaw desiring to speak with him, so he went to that gentleman's\nhouse instead. Sally was busy in her kitchen, making a great noise\n(not unlike a groom rubbing down a horse) over her cleaning.\nLeonard stole into the sitting-room, and crouched behind the large\nold-fashioned sofa to ease his sore, aching heart, by crying with all\nthe prodigal waste and abandonment of childhood.\n\nMr Benson was shown into Mr Bradshaw's own particular room. The\nlatter gentleman was walking up and down, and it was easy to perceive\nthat something had occurred to chafe him to great anger.\n\n\"Sit down, sir!\" said he to Mr Benson, nodding to a chair.\n\nMr Benson sat down. But Mr Bradshaw continued his walk for a few\nminutes longer without speaking. Then he stopped abruptly, right in\nfront of Mr Benson; and in a voice which he tried to render calm, but\nwhich trembled with passion--with a face glowing purple as he thought\nof his wrongs (and real wrongs they were), he began:\n\n\"Mr Benson, I have sent for you to ask--I am almost too indignant\nat the bare suspicion to speak as becomes me--but did you--I really\nshall be obliged to beg your pardon, if you are as much in the dark\nas I was yesterday as to the character of that woman who lives under\nyour roof?\"\n\nThere was no answer from Mr Benson. Mr Bradshaw looked at him very\nearnestly. His eyes were fixed on the ground--he made no inquiry--he\nuttered no expression of wonder or dismay. Mr Bradshaw ground his\nfoot on the floor with gathering rage; but just as he was about to\nspeak, Mr Benson rose up--a poor deformed old man--before the stern\nand portly figure that was swelling and panting with passion.\n\n\"Hear me, sir!\" (stretching out his hand as if to avert the words\nwhich were impending). \"Nothing you can say, can upbraid me like my\nown conscience; no degradation you can inflict, by word or deed, can\ncome up to the degradation I have suffered for years, at being a\nparty to a deceit, even for a good end--\"\n\n\"For a good end!--Nay! what next?\"\n\nThe taunting contempt with which Mr Bradshaw spoke these words almost\nsurprised himself by what he imagined must be its successful power of\nwithering; but in spite of it, Mr Benson lifted his grave eyes to Mr\nBradshaw's countenance, and repeated:\n\n\"For a good end. The end was not, as perhaps you consider it to have\nbeen, to obtain her admission into your family--nor yet to put her in\nthe way of gaining her livelihood; my sister and I would willingly\nhave shared what we have with her; it was our intention to do so at\nfirst, if not for any length of time, at least as long as her health\nmight require it. Why I advised (perhaps I only yielded to advice)\na change of name--an assumption of a false state of widowhood--was\nbecause I earnestly desired to place her in circumstances in which\nshe might work out her self-redemption; and you, sir, know how\nterribly the world goes against all such as have sinned as Ruth did.\nShe was so young, too.\"\n\n\"You mistake, sir; my acquaintance has not lain so much among that\nclass of sinners as to give me much experience of the way in which\nthey are treated. But, judging from what I have seen, I should say\nthey meet with full as much leniency as they deserve; and supposing\nthey do not--I know there are plenty of sickly sentimentalists just\nnow who reserve all their interest and regard for criminals--why\nnot pick out one of these to help you in your task of washing the\nblackamoor white? Why choose me to be imposed upon--my household into\nwhich to intrude your prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e? Why were my innocent children to be\nexposed to corruption? I say,\" said Mr Bradshaw, stamping his foot,\n\"how dared you come into this house, where you were looked upon as a\nminister of religion, with a lie in your mouth? How dared you single\nme out, of all people, to be gulled and deceived, and pointed at\nthrough the town as the person who had taken an abandoned woman into\nhis house to teach his daughters?\"\n\n\"I own my deceit was wrong and faithless.\"\n\n\"Yes! you can own it, now it is found out! There is small merit in\nthat, I think!\"\n\n\"Sir! I claim no merit. I take shame to myself. I did not single you\nout. You applied to me with your proposal that Ruth should be your\nchildren's governess.\"\n\n\"Pah!\"\n\n\"And the temptation was too great-- No! I will not say that--but the\ntemptation was greater than I could stand--it seemed to open out a\npath of usefulness.\"\n\n\"Now, don't let me hear you speak so,\" said Mr Bradshaw, blazing\nup. \"I can't stand it. It is too much to talk in that way when the\nusefulness was to consist in contaminating my innocent girls.\"\n\n\"God knows that if I had believed there had been any danger of such\ncontamination--God knows how I would have died sooner than have\nallowed her to enter your family. Mr Bradshaw, you believe me, don't\nyou?\" asked Mr Benson, earnestly.\n\n\"I really must be allowed the privilege of doubting what you say in\nfuture,\" said Mr Bradshaw, in a cold, contemptuous manner.\n\n\"I have deserved this,\" Mr Benson replied. \"But,\" continued he, after\na moment's pause, \"I will not speak of myself, but of Ruth. Surely,\nsir, the end I aimed at (the means I took to obtain it were wrong;\nyou cannot feel that more than I do) was a right one; and you\nwill not--you cannot say, that your children have suffered from\nassociating with her. I had her in my family, under the watchful eyes\nof three anxious persons for a year or more; we saw faults--no human\nbeing is without them--and poor Ruth's were but slight venial errors;\nbut we saw no sign of a corrupt mind--no glimpse of boldness or\nforwardness--no token of want of conscientiousness; she seemed, and\nwas, a young and gentle girl, who had been led astray before she\nfairly knew what life was.\"\n\n\"I suppose most depraved women have been innocent in their time,\"\nsaid Mr Bradshaw, with bitter contempt.\n\n\"Oh, Mr Bradshaw! Ruth was not depraved, and you know it. You cannot\nhave seen her--have known her daily, all these years, without\nacknowledging that!\" Mr Benson was almost breathless, awaiting Mr\nBradshaw's answer. The quiet self-control which he had maintained so\nlong, was gone now.\n\n\"I saw her daily--I did _not_ know her. If I had known her, I should\nhave known she was fallen and depraved, and consequently not fit to\ncome into my house, nor to associate with my pure children.\"\n\n\"Now I wish God would give me power to speak out convincingly what\nI believe to be His truth, that not every woman who has fallen is\ndepraved; that many--how many the Great Judgment Day will reveal\nto those who have shaken off the poor, sore, penitent hearts on\nearth--many, many crave and hunger after a chance for virtue--the\nhelp which no man gives to them--help--that gentle, tender help which\nJesus gave once to Mary Magdalen.\" Mr Benson was almost choked by his\nown feelings.\n\n\"Come, come, Mr Benson, let us have no more of this morbid way of\ntalking. The world has decided how such women are to be treated; and,\nyou may depend upon it, there is so much practical wisdom in the\nworld that its way of acting is right in the long run, and that no\none can fly in its face with impunity, unless, indeed, they stoop to\ndeceit and imposition.\"\n\n\"I take my stand with Christ against the world,\" said Mr Benson,\nsolemnly, disregarding the covert allusion to himself. \"What have the\nworld's ways ended in? Can we be much worse than we are?\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself, if you please.\"\n\n\"Is it not time to change some of our ways of thinking and acting? I\ndeclare before God, that if I believe in any one human truth, it is\nthis--that to every woman who, like Ruth, has sinned, should be given\na chance of self-redemption--and that such a chance should be given\nin no supercilious or contemptuous manner, but in the spirit of the\nholy Christ.\"\n\n\"Such as getting her into a friend's house under false colours.\"\n\n\"I do not argue on Ruth's case. In that I have acknowledged my error.\nI do not argue on any case. I state my firm belief, that it is God's\nwill that we should not dare to trample any of His creatures down\nto the hopeless dust; that it is God's will that the women who have\nfallen should be numbered among those who have broken hearts to be\nbound up, not cast aside as lost beyond recall. If this be God's\nwill, as a thing of God it will stand; and He will open a way.\"\n\n\"I should have attached much more importance to all your exhortation\non this point if I could have respected your conduct in other\nmatters. As it is, when I see a man who has deluded himself into\nconsidering falsehood right, I am disinclined to take his opinion on\nsubjects connected with morality; and I can no longer regard him as\na fitting exponent of the will of God. You perhaps understand what I\nmean, Mr Benson. I can no longer attend your chapel.\"\n\nIf Mr Benson had felt any hope of making Mr Bradshaw's obstinate\nmind receive the truth, that he acknowledged and repented of his\nconnivance at the falsehood by means of which Ruth had been received\ninto the Bradshaw family, this last sentence prevented his making the\nattempt. He simply bowed and took his leave--Mr Bradshaw attending\nhim to the door with formal ceremony.\n\nHe felt acutely the severance of the tie which Mr Bradshaw had just\nannounced to him. He had experienced many mortifications in his\nintercourse with that gentleman, but they had fallen off from\nhis meek spirit like drops of water from a bird's plumage; and\nnow he only remembered the acts of substantial kindness rendered\n(the ostentation all forgotten)--many happy hours and pleasant\nevenings--the children whom he had loved dearer than he thought\ntill now--the young people about whom he had cared, and whom he had\nstriven to lead aright. He was but a young man when Mr Bradshaw\nfirst came to his chapel; they had grown old together; he had never\nrecognised Mr Bradshaw as an old familiar friend so completely as now\nwhen they were severed.\n\nIt was with a heavy heart that he opened his own door. He went to his\nstudy immediately; he sat down to steady himself into his position.\n\nHow long he was there--silent and alone--reviewing his\nlife--confessing his sins--he did not know; but he heard some unusual\nsound in the house that disturbed him--roused him to present life.\nA slow, languid step came along the passage to the front door--the\nbreathing was broken by many sighs.\n\nRuth's hand was on the latch when Mr Benson came out. Her face\nwas very white, except two red spots on each cheek--her eyes were\ndeep-sunk and hollow, but glittered with feverish lustre. \"Ruth!\"\nexclaimed he. She moved her lips, but her throat and mouth were too\ndry for her to speak.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked he; for she had all her walking things\non, yet trembled so, even as she stood, that it was evident she could\nnot walk far without falling.\n\nShe hesitated--she looked up at him, still with the same dry\nglittering eyes. At last she whispered (for she could only speak in a\nwhisper), \"To Helmsby--I am going to Helmsby.\"\n\n\"Helmsby! my poor girl--may God have mercy upon you!\" for he saw she\nhardly knew what she was saying. \"Where is Helmsby?\"\n\n\"I don't know. In Lincolnshire, I think.\"\n\n\"But why are you going there?\"\n\n\"Hush! he's asleep,\" said she, as Mr Benson had unconsciously raised\nhis voice.\n\n\"Who is asleep?\" asked Mr Benson.\n\n\"That poor little boy,\" said she, beginning to quiver and cry.\n\n\"Come here!\" said he, authoritatively, drawing her into the study.\n\n\"Sit down in that chair. I will come back directly.\"\n\nHe went in search of his sister, but she had not returned. Then he\nhad recourse to Sally, who was as busy as ever about her cleaning.\n\n\"How long has Ruth been at home?\" asked he.\n\n\"Ruth! She has never been at home sin' morning. She and Leonard were\nto be off for the day somewhere or other with them Bradshaw girls.\"\n\n\"Then she has had no dinner?\"\n\n\"Not here, at any rate. I can't answer for what she may have done at\nother places.\"\n\n\"And Leonard--where is he?\"\n\n\"How should I know? With his mother, I suppose. Leastways, that was\nwhat was fixed on. I've enough to do of my own, without routing after\nother folks.\"\n\nShe went on scouring in no very good temper. Mr Benson stood silent\nfor a moment.\n\n\"Sally,\" he said, \"I want a cup of tea. Will you make it as soon as\nyou can; and some dry toast too? I'll come for it in ten minutes.\"\n\nStruck by something in his voice, she looked up at him for the first\ntime.\n\n\"What ha' ye been doing to yourself, to look so grim and grey? Tiring\nyourself all to tatters, looking after some naught, I'll be bound!\nWell! well! I mun make ye your tea, I reckon; but I did hope as you\ngrew older you'd ha' grown wiser!\"\n\nMr Benson made no reply, but went to look for Leonard, hoping that\nthe child's presence might bring back to his mother the power of\nself-control. He opened the parlour-door, and looked in, but saw no\none. Just as he was shutting it, however, he heard a deep, broken,\nsobbing sigh; and, guided by the sound, he found the boy lying on the\nfloor, fast asleep, but with his features all swollen and disfigured\nby passionate crying.\n\n\"Poor child! This was what she meant, then,\" thought Mr Benson. \"He\nhas begun his share of the sorrows too,\" he continued, pitifully.\n\"No! I will not waken him back to consciousness.\" So he returned\nalone into the study. Ruth sat where he had placed her, her head bent\nback, and her eyes shut. But when he came in she started up.\n\n\"I must be going,\" she said, in a hurried way.\n\n\"Nay, Ruth, you must not go. You must not leave us. We cannot do\nwithout you. We love you too much.\"\n\n\"Love me!\" said she, looking at him wistfully. As she looked, her\neyes filled slowly with tears. It was a good sign, and Mr Benson took\nheart to go on.\n\n\"Yes! Ruth. You know we do. You may have other things to fill up your\nmind just now, but you know we love you; and nothing can alter our\nlove for you. You ought not to have thought of leaving us. You would\nnot, if you had been quite well.\"\n\n\"Do you know what has happened?\" she asked, in a low, hoarse voice.\n\n\"Yes. I know all,\" he answered. \"It makes no difference to us. Why\nshould it?\"\n\n\"Oh! Mr Benson, don't you know that my shame is discovered?\" she\nreplied, bursting into tears--\"and I must leave you, and leave\nLeonard, that you may not share in my disgrace.\"\n\n\"You must do no such thing. Leave Leonard! You have no right to leave\nLeonard. Where could you go to?\"\n\n\"To Helmsby,\" she said, humbly. \"It would break my heart to go, but\nI think I ought, for Leonard's sake. I know I ought.\" She was crying\nsadly by this time, but Mr Benson knew the flow of tears would ease\nher brain. \"It will break my heart to go, but I know I must.\"\n\n\"Sit still here at present,\" said he, in a decided tone of command.\nHe went for the cup of tea. He brought it to her without Sally's\nbeing aware for whom it was intended.\n\n\"Drink this!\" He spoke as you would do to a child, if desiring it\nto take medicine. \"Eat some toast.\" She took the tea, and drank it\nfeverishly; but when she tried to eat, the food seemed to choke her.\nStill she was docile, and she tried.\n\n\"I cannot,\" said she at last, putting down the piece of toast. There\nwas a return to something of her usual tone in the words. She spoke\ngently and softly; no longer in the shrill, hoarse voice she had used\nat first. Mr Benson sat down by her.\n\n\"Now, Ruth, we must talk a little together. I want to understand what\nyour plan was. Where is Helmsby? Why did you fix to go there?\"\n\n\"It is where my mother lived,\" she answered. \"Before she was married\nshe lived there; and wherever she lived, the people all loved her\ndearly; and I thought--I think, that for her sake some one would give\nme work. I meant to tell them the truth,\" said she, dropping her\neyes; \"but still they would, perhaps, give me some employment--I\ndon't care what--for her sake. I could do many things,\" said she,\nsuddenly looking up. \"I am sure I could weed--I could in gardens--if\nthey did not like to have me in their houses. But perhaps some one,\nfor my mother's sake--oh! my dear, dear mother!--do you know where\nand what I am?\" she cried out, sobbing afresh.\n\nMr Benson's heart was very sore, though he spoke authoritatively, and\nalmost sternly.\n\n\"Ruth! you must be still and quiet. I cannot have this. I want you\nto listen to me. Your thought of Helmsby would be a good one, if it\nwas right for you to leave Eccleston; but I do not think it is. I\nam certain of this, that it would be a great sin in you to separate\nyourself from Leonard. You have no right to sever the tie by which\nGod has bound you together.\"\n\n\"But if I am here they will all know and remember the shame of his\nbirth; and if I go away they may forget--\"\n\n\"And they may not. And if you go away, he may be unhappy or ill; and\nyou, who above all others have--and have from God--remember _that_,\nRuth!--the power to comfort him, the tender patience to nurse him,\nhave left him to the care of strangers. Yes; I know! But we ourselves\nare as strangers, dearly as we love him, compared to a mother. He may\nturn to sin, and want the long forbearance, the serene authority of\na parent; and where are you? No dread of shame, either for yourself,\nor even for him, can ever make it right for you to shake off your\nresponsibility.\" All this time he was watching her narrowly, and saw\nher slowly yield herself up to the force of what he was saying.\n\n\"Besides, Ruth,\" he continued, \"we have gone on falsely hitherto. It\nhas been my doing, my mistake, my sin. I ought to have known better.\nNow, let us stand firm on the truth. You have no new fault to repent\nof. Be brave and faithful. It is to God you answer, not to men. The\nshame of having your sin known to the world, should be as nothing to\nthe shame you felt at having sinned. We have dreaded men too much,\nand God too little, in the course we have taken. But now be of good\ncheer. Perhaps you will have to find your work in the world very\nlow--not quite working in the fields,\" said he, with a gentle smile,\nto which she, downcast and miserable, could give no response. \"Nay,\nperhaps, Ruth,\" he went on, \"you may have to stand and wait for some\ntime; no one may be willing to use the services you would gladly\nrender; all may turn aside from you, and may speak very harshly of\nyou. Can you accept all this treatment meekly, as but the reasonable\nand just penance God has laid upon you--feeling no anger against\nthose who slight you, no impatience for the time to come (and come it\nsurely will--I speak as having the word of God for what I say) when\nHe, having purified you, even as by fire, will make a straight path\nfor your feet? My child, it is Christ the Lord who has told us of\nthis infinite mercy of God. Have you faith enough in it to be brave,\nand bear on, and do rightly in patience and in tribulation?\"\n\nRuth had been hushed and very still until now, when the pleading\nearnestness of his question urged her to answer:\n\n\"Yes!\" said she. \"I hope--I believe I can be faithful for myself, for\nI have sinned and done wrong. But Leonard--\" She looked up at him.\n\n\"But Leonard,\" he echoed. \"Ah! there it is hard, Ruth. I own the\nworld is hard and persecuting to such as he.\" He paused to think\nof the true comfort for this sting. He went on. \"The world is not\neverything, Ruth; nor is the want of men's good opinion and esteem\nthe highest need which man has. Teach Leonard this. You would not\nwish his life to be one summer's day. You dared not make it so, if\nyou had the power. Teach him to bid a noble, Christian welcome to\nthe trials which God sends--and this is one of them. Teach him not\nto look on a life of struggle, and perhaps of disappointment and\nincompleteness, as a sad and mournful end, but as the means permitted\nto the heroes and warriors in the army of Christ, by which to show\ntheir faithful following. Tell him of the hard and thorny path which\nwas trodden once by the bleeding feet of One. Ruth! think of the\nSaviour's life and cruel death, and of His divine faithfulness. Oh,\nRuth!\" exclaimed he, \"when I look and see what you may be--what you\n_must_ be to that boy, I cannot think how you could be coward enough,\nfor a moment, to shrink from your work! But we have all been cowards\nhitherto,\" he added, in bitter self-accusation. \"God help us to be so\nno longer!\"\n\nRuth sat very quiet. Her eyes were fixed on the ground, and she\nseemed lost in thought. At length she rose up.\n\n\"Mr Benson!\" said she, standing before him, and propping herself by\nthe table, as she was trembling sadly from weakness, \"I mean to try\nvery, very hard, to do my duty to Leonard--and to God,\" she added,\nreverently. \"I am only afraid my faith may sometimes fail about\nLeonard--\"\n\n\"Ask, and it shall be given unto you. That is no vain or untried\npromise, Ruth!\"\n\nShe sat down again, unable longer to stand. There was another long\nsilence.\n\n\"I must never go to Mr Bradshaw's again,\" she said at last, as if\nthinking aloud.\n\n\"No, Ruth, you shall not,\" he answered.\n\n\"But I shall earn no money!\" added she, quickly, for she thought that\nhe did not perceive the difficulty that was troubling her.\n\n\"You surely know, Ruth, that while Faith and I have a roof to shelter\nus, or bread to eat, you and Leonard share it with us.\"\n\n\"I know--I know your most tender goodness,\" said she, \"but it ought\nnot to be.\"\n\n\"It must be at present,\" he said, in a decided manner. \"Perhaps\nbefore long you may have some employment; perhaps it may be some time\nbefore an opportunity occurs.\"\n\n\"Hush,\" said Ruth; \"Leonard is moving about in the parlour. I must go\nto him.\"\n\nBut when she stood up, she turned so dizzy, and tottered so much,\nthat she was glad to sit down again immediately.\n\n\"You must rest here. I will go to him,\" said Mr Benson. He left her;\nand when he was gone, she leaned her head on the back of the chair,\nand cried quietly and incessantly; but there was a more patient,\nhopeful, resolved feeling in her heart, which all along, through all\nthe tears she shed, bore her onwards to higher thoughts, until at\nlast she rose to prayers.\n\nMr Benson caught the new look of shrinking shame in Leonard's eye, as\nit first sought, then shunned, meeting his. He was pained, too, by\nthe sight of the little sorrowful, anxious face, on which, until now,\nhope and joy had been predominant. The constrained voice, the few\nwords the boy spoke, when formerly there would have been a glad and\nfree utterance--all this grieved Mr Benson inexpressibly, as but the\nbeginning of an unwonted mortification, which must last for years.\nHe himself made no allusion to any unusual occurrence; he spoke of\nRuth as sitting, overcome by headache, in the study for quietness:\nhe hurried on the preparations for tea, while Leonard sat by in the\ngreat arm-chair, and looked on with sad, dreamy eyes. He strove\nto lessen the shock which he knew Leonard had received, by every\nmixture of tenderness and cheerfulness that Mr Benson's gentle heart\nprompted; and now and then a languid smile stole over the boy's face.\nWhen his bedtime came, Mr Benson told him of the hour, although\nhe feared that Leonard would have but another sorrowful crying of\nhimself to sleep; but he was anxious to accustom the boy to cheerful\nmovement within the limits of domestic law, and by no disobedience to\nit to weaken the power of glad submission to the Supreme; to begin\nthe new life that lay before him, where strength to look up to God\nas the Law-giver and Ruler of events would be pre-eminently required.\nWhen Leonard had gone upstairs, Mr Benson went immediately to Ruth,\nand said,\n\n\"Ruth! Leonard is just gone up to bed,\" secure in the instinct which\nmade her silently rise, and go up to the boy--certain, too, that\nthey would each be the other's best comforter, and that God would\nstrengthen each through the other.\n\nNow, for the first time, he had leisure to think of himself; and to\ngo over all the events of the day. The half-hour of solitude in his\nstudy, that he had before his sister's return, was of inestimable\nvalue; he had leisure to put events in their true places, as to\nimportance and eternal significance.\n\nMiss Faith came in laden with farm produce. Her kind entertainers had\nbrought her in their shandry to the opening of the court in which\nthe Chapel-house stood; but she was so heavily burdened with eggs,\nmushrooms, and plums, that when her brother opened the door she was\nalmost breathless.\n\n\"Oh, Thurstan! take this basket--it is such a weight! Oh, Sally,\nis that you? Here are some magnum-bonums which we must preserve\nto-morrow. There are guinea-fowl eggs in that basket.\"\n\nMr Benson let her unburden her body, and her mind too, by giving\ncharges to Sally respecting her housekeeping treasures, before he\nsaid a word; but when she returned into the study, to tell him the\nsmall pieces of intelligence respecting her day at the farm, she\nstood aghast.\n\n\"Why, Thurstan, dear! What's the matter? Is your back hurting you?\"\n\nHe smiled to reassure her; but it was a sickly and forced smile.\n\n\"No, Faith! I am quite well, only rather out of spirits, and wanting\nto talk to you to cheer me.\"\n\nMiss Faith sat down, straight, sitting bolt-upright to listen the\nbetter.\n\n\"I don't know how, but the real story about Ruth is found out.\"\n\n\"Oh, Thurstan!\" exclaimed Miss Benson, turning quite white.\n\nFor a moment, neither of them said another word. Then she went on.\n\n\"Does Mr Bradshaw know?\"\n\n\"Yes! He sent for me, and told me.\"\n\n\"Does Ruth know that it has all come out?\"\n\n\"Yes. And Leonard knows.\"\n\n\"How? Who told him?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I have asked no questions. But of course it was his\nmother.\"\n\n\"She was very foolish and cruel, then,\" said Miss Benson, her eyes\nblazing, and her lips trembling, at the thought of the suffering her\ndarling boy must have gone through.\n\n\"I think she was wise. I am sure it was not cruel. He must have soon\nknown that there was some mystery, and it was better that it should\nbe told him openly and quietly by his mother than by a stranger.\"\n\n\"How could she tell him quietly?\" asked Miss Benson, still indignant.\n\n\"Well! perhaps I used the wrong word--of course no one was by--and I\ndon't suppose even they themselves could now tell how it was told, or\nin what spirit it was borne.\"\n\nMiss Benson was silent again.\n\n\"Was Mr Bradshaw very angry?\"\n\n\"Yes, very; and justly so. I did very wrong in making that false\nstatement at first.\"\n\n\"No! I am sure you did not,\" said Miss Faith. \"Ruth has had some\nyears of peace, in which to grow stronger and wiser, so that she can\nbear her shame now in a way she never could have done at first.\"\n\n\"All the same it was wrong in me to do what I did.\"\n\n\"I did it too, as much or more than you. And I don't think it wrong.\nI'm certain it was quite right, and I would do just the same again.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it has not done you the harm it has done me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Thurstan. Don't be morbid. I'm sure you are as good--and\nbetter than ever you were.\"\n\n\"No, I am not. I have got what you call morbid just in consequence of\nthe sophistry by which I persuaded myself that wrong could be right.\nI torment myself. I have lost my clear instincts of conscience.\nFormerly, if I believed that such or such an action was according\nto the will of God, I went and did it, or at least I tried to do it,\nwithout thinking of consequences. Now, I reason and weigh what will\nhappen if I do so and so--I grope where formerly I saw. Oh, Faith! it\nis such a relief to me to have the truth known, that I am afraid I\nhave not been sufficiently sympathising with Ruth.\"\n\n\"Poor Ruth!\" said Miss Benson. \"But at any rate our telling a lie has\nbeen the saving of her. There is no fear of her going wrong now.\"\n\n\"God's omnipotence did not need our sin.\"\n\nThey did not speak for some time.\n\n\"You have not told me what Mr Bradshaw said.\"\n\n\"One can't remember the exact words that are spoken on either side in\nmoments of such strong excitement. He was very angry, and said some\nthings about me that were very just, and some about Ruth that were\nvery hard. His last words were that he should give up coming to\nchapel.\"\n\n\"Oh, Thurstan! did it come to that?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Does Ruth know all he said?\"\n\n\"No! Why should she? I don't know if she knows he has spoken to me at\nall. Poor creature! she had enough to craze her almost without that!\nShe was for going away and leaving us, that we might not share in her\ndisgrace. I was afraid of her being quite delirious. I did so want\nyou, Faith! However, I did the best I could; I spoke to her very\ncoldly, and almost sternly, all the while my heart was bleeding for\nher. I dared not give her sympathy; I tried to give her strength. But\nI did so want you, Faith.\"\n\n\"And I was so full of enjoyment, I am ashamed to think of it. But the\nDawsons are so kind--and the day was so fine-- Where is Ruth now?\"\n\n\"With Leonard. He is her great earthly motive--I thought that being\nwith him would be best. But he must be in bed and asleep now.\"\n\n\"I will go up to her,\" said Miss Faith.\n\nShe found Ruth keeping watch by Leonard's troubled sleep; but when\nshe saw Miss Faith she rose up, and threw herself on her neck and\nclung to her, without speaking. After a while Miss Benson said:\n\n\"You must go to bed, Ruth!\" So, after she had kissed the sleeping\nboy, Miss Benson led her away, and helped to undress her, and brought\nher up a cup of soothing violet tea--not so soothing as tender\nactions and soft loving tones.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nAn Understanding Between Lovers\n\n\nIt was well they had so early and so truly strengthened the spirit\nto bear, for the events which had to be endured soon came thick and\nthreefold.\n\nEvery evening Mr and Miss Benson thought the worst must be over;\nand every day brought some fresh occurrence to touch upon the raw\nplace. They could not be certain, until they had seen all their\nacquaintances, what difference it would make in the cordiality of\ntheir reception: in some cases it made much; and Miss Benson was\nproportionably indignant. She felt this change in behaviour more than\nher brother. His great pain arose from the coolness of the Bradshaws.\nWith all the faults which had at times grated on his sensitive\nnature (but which he now forgot, and remembered only their kindness),\nthey were his old familiar friends--his kind, if ostentatious,\npatrons--his great personal interest, out of his own family; and he\ncould not get over the suffering he experienced from seeing their\nlarge square pew empty on Sundays--from perceiving how Mr Bradshaw,\nthough he bowed in a distant manner when he and Mr Benson met face to\nface, shunned him as often as he possibly could. All that happened in\nthe household, which once was as patent to him as his own, was now\na sealed book; he heard of its doings by chance, if he heard at all.\nJust at the time when he was feeling the most depressed from this\ncause, he met Jemima at a sudden turn of the street. He was uncertain\nfor a moment how to accost her, but she saved him all doubt; in an\ninstant she had his hand in both of hers, her face flushed with\nhonest delight.\n\n\"Oh, Mr Benson, I am so glad to see you! I have so wanted to know all\nabout you! How is poor Ruth? dear Ruth! I wonder if she has forgiven\nme my cruelty to her? And I may not go to her now, when I should be\nso glad and thankful to make up for it.\"\n\n\"I never heard you had been cruel to her. I am sure she does not\nthink so.\"\n\n\"She ought; she must. What is she doing? Oh! I have so much to ask, I\ncan never hear enough; and papa says\"--she hesitated a moment, afraid\nof giving pain, and then, believing that they would understand the\nstate of affairs, and the reason for her behaviour better if she told\nthe truth, she went on: \"Papa says I must not go to your house--I\nsuppose it's right to obey him?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear. It is your clear duty. We know how you feel\ntowards us.\"\n\n\"Oh! but if I could do any good--if I could be of any use or comfort\nto any of you--especially to Ruth, I should come, duty or not. I\nbelieve it would be my duty,\" said she, hurrying on to try and stop\nany decided prohibition from Mr Benson. \"No! don't be afraid; I won't\ncome till I know I can do some good. I hear bits about you through\nSally every now and then, or I could not have waited so long. Mr\nBenson,\" continued she, reddening very much, \"I think you did quite\nright about poor Ruth.\"\n\n\"Not in the falsehood, my dear.\"\n\n\"No! not perhaps in that. I was not thinking of that. But I have been\nthinking a great deal about poor Ruth's--you know I could not help it\nwhen everybody was talking about it--and it made me think of myself,\nand what I am. With a father and mother, and home and careful\nfriends, I am not likely to be tempted like Ruth; but oh! Mr Benson,\"\nsaid she, lifting her eyes, which were full of tears, to his face,\nfor the first time since she began to speak, \"if you knew all I have\nbeen thinking and feeling this last year, you would see how I have\nyielded to every temptation that was able to come to me; and, seeing\nhow I have no goodness or strength in me, and how I might just have\nbeen like Ruth, or rather, worse than she ever was, because I am more\nheadstrong and passionate by nature, I do so thank you and love you\nfor what you did for her! And will you tell me really and truly now\nif I can ever do anything for Ruth? If you'll promise me that, I\nwon't rebel unnecessarily against papa; but if you don't, I will, and\ncome and see you all this very afternoon. Remember! I trust you!\"\nsaid she, breaking away. Then turning back, she came to ask after\nLeonard.\n\n\"He must know something of it,\" said she. \"Does he feel it much?\"\n\n\"Very much,\" said Mr Benson. Jemima shook her head sadly.\n\n\"It is hard upon him,\" said she.\n\n\"It is,\" Mr Benson replied.\n\nFor in truth, Leonard was their greatest anxiety indoors. His health\nseemed shaken, he spoke half sentences in his sleep, which showed\nthat in his dreams he was battling on his mother's behalf against an\nunkind and angry world. And then he would wail to himself, and utter\nsad words of shame, which they never thought had reached his ears. By\nday, he was in general grave and quiet; but his appetite varied, and\nhe was evidently afraid of going into the streets, dreading to be\npointed at as an object of remark. Each separately in their hearts\nlonged to give him change of scene, but they were all silent, for\nwhere was the requisite money to come from?\n\nHis temper became fitful and variable. At times he would be most\nsullen against his mother; and then give way to a passionate remorse.\nWhen Mr Benson caught Ruth's look of agony at her child's rebuffs,\nhis patience failed; or rather, I should say, he believed that a\nstronger, severer hand than hers was required for the management of\nthe lad. But, when she heard Mr Benson say so, she pleaded with him.\n\n\"Have patience with Leonard,\" she said. \"I have deserved the anger\nthat is fretting in his heart. It is only I who can reinstate myself\nin his love and respect. I have no fear. When he sees me really\nstriving hard and long to do what is right, he must love me. I am not\nafraid.\"\n\nEven while she spoke, her lips quivered, and her colour went and came\nwith eager anxiety. So Mr Benson held his peace, and let her take her\ncourse. It was beautiful to see the intuition by which she divined\nwhat was passing in every fold of her child's heart, so as to be\nalways ready with the right words to soothe or to strengthen him. Her\nwatchfulness was unwearied, and with no thought of self-tainting in\nit, or else she might have often paused to turn aside and weep at the\nclouds of shame which came over Leonard's love for her, and hid it\nfrom all but her faithful heart; she believed and knew that he was\nyet her own affectionate boy, although he might be gloomily silent,\nor apparently hard and cold. And in all this, Mr Benson could not\nchoose but admire the way in which she was insensibly teaching\nLeonard to conform to the law of right, to recognise Duty in the mode\nin which every action was performed. When Mr Benson saw this, he\nknew that all goodness would follow, and that the claims which his\nmother's infinite love had on the boy's heart would be acknowledged\nat last, and all the more fully because she herself never urged them,\nbut silently admitted the force of the reason that caused them to be\nfor a time forgotten. By-and-by Leonard's remorse at his ungracious\nand sullen ways to his mother--ways that alternated with passionate,\nfitful bursts of clinging love--assumed more the character of\nrepentance; he tried to do so no more. But still his health was\ndelicate; he was averse to going out-of-doors; he was much graver\nand sadder than became his age. It was what must be, an inevitable\nconsequence of what had been; and Ruth had to be patient, and pray in\nsecret, and with many tears, for the strength she needed.\n\nShe knew what it was to dread the going out into the streets after\nher story had become known. For days and days she had silently shrunk\nfrom this effort. But one evening towards dusk, Miss Benson was busy,\nand asked her to go an errand for her; and Ruth got up and silently\nobeyed her. That silence as to inward suffering was only one part of\nher peculiar and exquisite sweetness of nature; part of the patience\nwith which she \"accepted her penance.\" Her true instincts told her\nthat it was not right to disturb others with many expressions of her\nremorse; that the holiest repentance consisted in a quiet and daily\nsacrifice. Still there were times when she wearied pitifully of\nher inaction. She was so willing to serve and work, and every one\ndespised her services. Her mind, as I have said before, had been\nwell cultivated during these last few years; so now she used all the\nknowledge she had gained in teaching Leonard, which was an employment\nthat Mr Benson relinquished willingly, because he felt that it would\ngive her some of the occupation that she needed. She endeavoured to\nmake herself useful in the house in every way she could; but the\nwaters of housekeeping had closed over her place during the time of\nher absence at Mr Bradshaw's--and, besides, now that they were trying\nto restrict every unnecessary expense, it was sometimes difficult\nto find work for three women. Many and many a time Ruth turned over\nin her mind every possible chance of obtaining employment for her\nleisure hours, and nowhere could she find it. Now and then Sally, who\nwas her confidante in this wish, procured her some needlework, but\nit was of a coarse and common kind, soon done, lightly paid for. But\nwhatever it was, Ruth took it, and was thankful, although it added\nbut a few pence to the household purse. I do not mean that there was\nany great need of money; but a new adjustment of expenditure was\nrequired--a reduction of wants which had never been very extravagant.\n\nRuth's salary of forty pounds was gone, while more of her \"keep,\"\nas Sally called it, was thrown upon the Bensons. Mr Benson received\nabout eighty pounds a year for his salary as minister. Of this, he\nknew that twenty pounds came from Mr Bradshaw; and when the old man\nappointed to collect the pew-rents brought him the quarterly amount,\nand he found no diminution in them, he inquired how it was, and\nlearnt that, although Mr Bradshaw had expressed to the collector his\ndetermination never to come to chapel again, he had added, that of\ncourse his pew-rent should be paid all the same. But this Mr Benson\ncould not suffer; and the old man was commissioned to return the\nmoney to Mr Bradshaw, as being what his deserted minister could not\nreceive.\n\nMr and Miss Benson had about thirty or forty pounds coming in\nannually from a sum which, in happier days, Mr Bradshaw had invested\nin Canal shares for them. Altogether their income did not fall much\nshort of a hundred a year, and they lived in the Chapel-house free of\nrent. So Ruth's small earnings were but very little in actual hard\ncommercial account, though in another sense they were much; and Miss\nBenson always received them with quiet simplicity. By degrees, Mr\nBenson absorbed some of Ruth's time in a gracious and natural way. He\nemployed her mind in all the kind offices he was accustomed to render\nto the poor around him. And as much of the peace and ornament of life\nas they gained now, was gained on a firm basis of truth. If Ruth\nbegan low down to find her place in the world, at any rate there was\nno flaw in the foundation.\n\nLeonard was still their great anxiety. At times the question seemed\nto be, could he live through all this trial of the elasticity of\nchildhood? And then they knew how precious a blessing--how true a\npillar of fire, he was to his mother; and how black the night, and\nhow dreary the wilderness would be, when he was not. The child and\nthe mother were each messengers of God--angels to each other.\n\nThey had long gaps between the pieces of intelligence respecting\nthe Bradshaws. Mr Bradshaw had at length purchased the house at\nAbermouth, and they were much there. The way in which the Bensons\nheard most frequently of the family of their former friends, was\nthrough Mr Farquhar. He called on Mr Benson about a month after the\nlatter had met Jemima in the street. Mr Farquhar was not in the habit\nof paying calls on any one; and though he had always entertained and\nevinced the most kind and friendly feeling towards Mr Benson, he had\nrarely been in the Chapel-house. Mr Benson received him courteously,\nbut he rather expected that there would be some especial reason\nalleged, before the conclusion of the visit, for its occurrence; more\nparticularly as Mr Farquhar sat talking on the topics of the day in a\nsomewhat absent manner, as if they were not the subjects most present\nto his mind. The truth was, he could not help recurring to the last\ntime when he was in that room, waiting to take Leonard a ride, and\nhis heart beating rather more quickly than usual at the idea that\nRuth might bring the boy in when he was equipped. He was very full\nnow of the remembrance of Ruth; and yet he was also most thankful,\nmost self-gratulatory, that he had gone no further in his admiration\nof her--that he had never expressed his regard in words--that no one,\nas he believed, was cognisant of the incipient love which had grown\npartly out of his admiration, and partly out of his reason. He was\nthankful to be spared any implication in the nine-days' wonder which\nher story had made in Eccleston. And yet his feeling for her had been\nof so strong a character, that he winced, as with extreme pain, at\nevery application of censure to her name. These censures were often\nexaggerated, it is true; but when they were just in their judgment of\nthe outward circumstances of the case, they were not the less painful\nand distressing to him. His first rebound to Jemima was occasioned by\nMrs Bradshaw's account of how severely her husband was displeased at\nher daughter's having taken part with Ruth; and he could have thanked\nand almost blessed Jemima when she dropped in (she dared do no more)\nher pleading excuses and charitable explanations on Ruth's behalf.\nJemima had learnt some humility from the discovery which had been\nto her so great a shock; standing, she had learnt to take heed lest\nshe fell; and when she had once been aroused to a perception of the\nviolence of the hatred which she had indulged against Ruth, she was\nmore reticent and measured in the expression of all her opinions. It\nshowed how much her character had been purified from pride, that now\nshe felt aware that what in her was again attracting Mr Farquhar was\nher faithful advocacy of her rival, wherever such advocacy was wise\nor practicable. He was quite unaware that Jemima had been conscious\nof his great admiration for Ruth; he did not know that she had ever\ncared enough for him to be jealous. But the unacknowledged bond\nbetween them now was their grief, and sympathy, and pity for Ruth;\nonly in Jemima these feelings were ardent, and would fain have\nbecome active; while in Mr Farquhar they were strongly mingled\nwith thankfulness that he had escaped a disagreeable position,\nand a painful notoriety. His natural caution induced him to make\na resolution never to think of any woman as a wife until he had\nascertained all her antecedents, from her birth upwards; and the\nsame spirit of caution, directed inwardly, made him afraid of giving\ntoo much pity to Ruth, for fear of the conclusions to which such\na feeling might lead him. But still his old regard for her, for\nLeonard, and his esteem and respect for the Bensons, induced him to\nlend a willing ear to Jemima's earnest entreaty that he would go and\ncall on Mr Benson, in order that she might learn something about the\nfamily in general, and Ruth in particular. It was thus that he came\nto sit by Mr Benson's study fire, and to talk, in an absent way, to\nthat gentleman. How they got on the subject he did not know, more\nthan one-half of his attention being distracted; but they were\nspeaking about politics, when Mr Farquhar learned that Mr Benson took\nin no newspaper.\n\n\"Will you allow me to send you over my _Times_? I have generally\ndone with it before twelve o'clock, and after that it is really\nwaste-paper in my house. You will oblige me by making use of it.\"\n\n\"I am sure I am very much obliged to you for thinking of it. But do\nnot trouble yourself to send it; Leonard can fetch it.\"\n\n\"How is Leonard now?\" asked Mr Farquhar, and he tried to speak\nindifferently; but a grave look of intelligence clouded his eyes as\nhe looked for Mr Benson's answer. \"I have not met him lately.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Mr Benson, with an expression of pain in his countenance,\nthough he, too, strove to speak in his usual tone.\n\n\"Leonard is not strong, and we find it difficult to induce him to go\nmuch out-of-doors.\"\n\nThere was a little silence for a minute or two, during which Mr\nFarquhar had to check an unbidden sigh. But, suddenly rousing himself\ninto a determination to change the subject, he said:\n\n\"You will find rather a lengthened account of the exposure of Sir\nThomas Campbell's conduct at Baden. He seems to be a complete\nblackleg, in spite of his baronetcy. I fancy the papers are glad to\nget hold of anything just now.\"\n\n\"Who is Sir Thomas Campbell?\" asked Mr Benson.\n\n\"Oh, I thought you might have heard the report--a true one, I\nbelieve--of Mr Donne's engagement to his daughter. He must be glad\nshe jilted him now, I fancy, after this public exposure of her\nfather's conduct.\" (That was an awkward speech, as Mr Farquhar felt;\nand he hastened to cover it, by going on without much connexion:)\n\n\"Dick Bradshaw is my informant about all these projected marriages\nin high life--they are not much in my way; but since he has come\ndown from London to take his share in the business, I think I have\nheard more of the news and the scandal of what, I suppose, would\nbe considered high life, than ever I did before; and Mr Donne's\nproceedings seem to be an especial object of interest to him.\"\n\n\"And Mr Donne is engaged to a Miss Campbell, is he?\"\n\n\"Was engaged; if I understood right, she broke off the engagement to\nmarry some Russian prince or other--a better match, Dick Bradshaw\ntold me. I assure you,\" continued Mr Farquhar, smiling, \"I am a very\npassive recipient of all such intelligence, and might very probably\nhave forgotten all about it, if the _Times_ of this morning had not\nbeen so full of the disgrace of the young lady's father.\"\n\n\"Richard Bradshaw has quite left London, has he?\" asked Mr Benson,\nwho felt far more interest in his old patron's family than in all the\nCampbells that ever were or ever would be.\n\n\"Yes. He has come to settle down here. I hope he may do well, and not\ndisappoint his father, who has formed very high expectations from\nhim; I am not sure if they are not too high for any young man to\nrealise.\" Mr Farquhar could have said more, but Dick Bradshaw was\nJemima's brother, and an object of anxiety to her.\n\n\"I am sure, I trust such a mortification--such a grief as any\ndisappointment in Richard, may not befall his father,\" replied Mr\nBenson.\n\n\"Jemima--Miss Bradshaw,\" said Mr Farquhar, hesitating, \"was most\nanxious to hear of you all. I hope I may tell her you are all well\"\n(with an emphasis on _all_); \"that--\"\n\n\"Thank you. Thank her for us. We are all well; all except Leonard,\nwho is not strong, as I said before. But we must be patient. Time,\nand such devoted, tender love as he has from his mother, must do\nmuch.\"\n\nMr Farquhar was silent.\n\n\"Send him to my house for the papers. It will be a little necessity\nfor him to have some regular exercise, and to face the world. He must\ndo it, sooner or later.\"\n\nThe two gentlemen shook hands with each other on parting; but no\nfurther allusion was made to either Ruth or Leonard.\n\nSo Leonard went for the papers. Stealing along by back\nstreets--running with his head bent down--his little heart panting\nwith dread of being pointed out as his mother's child--so he used to\ncome back, and run trembling to Sally, who would hush him up to her\nbreast with many a rough-spoken word of pity and sympathy.\n\nMr Farquhar tried to catch him to speak to him, and tame him as it\nwere; and, by-and-by, he contrived to interest him sufficiently to\ninduce the boy to stay a little while in the house, or stables, or\ngarden. But the race through the streets was always to be dreaded as\nthe end of ever so pleasant a visit.\n\nMr Farquhar kept up the intercourse with the Bensons which he had\nthus begun. He persevered in paying calls--quiet visits, where\nnot much was said, political or local news talked about, and the\nsame inquiries always made and answered as to the welfare of the\ntwo families, who were estranged from each other. Mr Farquhar's\nreports were so little varied that Jemima grew anxious to know more\nparticulars.\n\n\"Oh, Mr Farquhar!\" said she; \"do you think they tell you the truth? I\nwonder what Ruth can be doing to support herself and Leonard? Nothing\nthat you can hear of, you say; and, of course, one must not ask the\ndownright question. And yet I am sure they must be pinched in some\nway. Do you think Leonard is stronger?\"\n\n\"I am not sure. He is growing fast; and such a blow as he has had\nwill be certain to make him more thoughtful and full of care than\nmost boys of his age; both these circumstances may make him thin and\npale, which he certainly is.\"\n\n\"Oh! how I wish I might go and see them all! I could tell in a\ntwinkling the real state of things.\" She spoke with a tinge of her\nold impatience.\n\n\"I will go again, and pay particular attention to anything you wish\nme to observe. You see, of course, I feel a delicacy about asking\nany direct questions, or even alluding in any way to these late\noccurrences.\"\n\n\"And you never see Ruth by any chance?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\nThey did not look at each other while this last question was asked\nand answered.\n\n\"I will take the paper to-morrow myself; it will be an excuse for\ncalling again, and I will try to be very penetrating; but I have not\nmuch hope of success.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you. It is giving you a great deal of trouble; but you are\nvery kind.\"\n\n\"Kind, Jemima!\" he repeated, in a tone which made her go very red\nand hot; \"must I tell you how you can reward me?--Will you call me\nWalter?--say, thank you, Walter--just for once.\"\n\nJemima felt herself yielding to the voice and tone in which this was\nspoken; but her very consciousness of the depth of her love made her\nafraid of giving way, and anxious to be wooed, that she might be\nreinstated in her self-esteem.\n\n\"No!\" said she, \"I don't think I can call you so. You are too old. It\nwould not be respectful.\" She meant it half in joke, and had no idea\nhe would take the allusion to his age so seriously as he did. He rose\nup, and coldly, as a matter of form, in a changed voice, wished her\n\"Good-bye.\" Her heart sank; yet the old pride was there. But as he\nwas at the very door, some sudden impulse made her speak:\n\n\"I have not vexed you, have I, Walter?\"\n\nHe turned round, glowing with a thrill of delight. She was as red as\nany rose; her looks dropped down to the ground.\n\nThey were not raised when, half an hour afterwards, she said, \"You\nwon't forbid my going to see Ruth, will you? because if you do,\nI give you notice I shall disobey you.\" The arm around her waist\nclasped her yet more fondly at the idea, suggested by this speech, of\nthe control which he should have a right to exercise over her actions\nat some future day.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said he, \"how much of your goodness to me, this last happy\nhour, has been owing to the desire of having more freedom as a wife\nthan as a daughter?\"\n\nShe was almost glad that he should think she needed any additional\nmotive to her love for him before she could have accepted him. She\nwas afraid that she had betrayed the deep, passionate regard with\nwhich she had long looked upon him. She was lost in delight at her\nown happiness. She was silent for a time. At length she said:\n\n\"I don't think you know how faithful I have been to you ever since\nthe days when you first brought me pistachio-candy from London--when\nI was quite a little girl.\"\n\n\"Not more faithful than I have been to you,\" for in truth, the\nrecollection of his love for Ruth had utterly faded away, and he\nthought himself a model of constancy; \"and you have tried me pretty\nwell. What a vixen you have been!\"\n\nJemima sighed; smitten with the consciousness of how little she had\ndeserved her present happiness; humble with the recollection of the\nevil thoughts that had raged in her heart during the time (which she\nremembered well, though he might have forgotten it) when Ruth had had\nthe affection which her jealous rival coveted.\n\n\"I may speak to your father, may not I, Jemima?\"\n\nNo! for some reason or fancy which she could not define, and\ncould not be persuaded out of, she wished to keep their mutual\nunderstanding a secret. She had a natural desire to avoid the\ncongratulations she expected from her family. She dreaded her\nfather's consideration of the whole affair as a satisfactory disposal\nof his daughter to a worthy man, who, being his partner, would not\nrequire any abstraction of capital from the concern, and Richard's\nmore noisy delight at his sister's having \"hooked\" so good a match.\nIt was only her simple-hearted mother that she longed to tell. She\nknew that her mother's congratulations would not jar upon her, though\nthey might not sound the full organ-peal of her love. But all that\nher mother knew passed onwards to her father; so for the present,\nat any rate, she determined to realise her secret position alone.\nSomehow, the sympathy of all others that she most longed for was\nRuth's; but the first communication of such an event was due to\nher parents. She imposed very strict regulations on Mr Farquhar's\nbehaviour; and quarrelled and differed from him more than ever, but\nwith a secret joyful understanding with him in her heart, even while\nthey disagreed with each other--for similarity of opinion is not\nalways--I think not often--needed for fulness and perfection of love.\n\nAfter Ruth's \"detection,\" as Mr Bradshaw used to call it, he said he\ncould never trust another governess again; so Mary and Elizabeth had\nbeen sent to school the following Christmas, and their place in the\nfamily was but poorly supplied by the return of Mr Richard Bradshaw,\nwho had left London, and been received as a partner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nSally Takes Her Money Out of the Bank\n\n\nThe conversation narrated in the last chapter as taking place between\nMr Farquhar and Jemima, occurred about a year after Ruth's dismissal\nfrom her situation. That year, full of small events, and change\nof place to the Bradshaws, had been monotonous and long in its\ncourse to the other household. There had been no want of peace and\ntranquillity; there had, perhaps, been more of them than in the\npreceding years, when, though unacknowledged by any, all must have\noccasionally felt the oppression of the falsehood--and a slight\nglancing dread must have flashed across their most prosperous state,\nlest, somehow or another, the mystery should be disclosed. But now,\nas the shepherd-boy in John Bunyan sweetly sang, \"He that is low need\nfear no fall.\"\n\nStill, their peace was as the stillness of a grey autumnal day, when\nno sun is to be seen above, and when a quiet film seems drawn before\nboth sky and earth, as if to rest the wearied eyes after the summer's\nglare. Few events broke the monotony of their lives, and those events\nwere of a depressing kind. They consisted in Ruth's futile endeavours\nto obtain some employment, however humble; in Leonard's fluctuations\nof spirits and health; in Sally's increasing deafness; in the final\nand unmendable wearing-out of the parlour carpet, which there was\nno spare money to replace, and so they cheerfully supplied its want\nby a large hearth-rug that Ruth made out of ends of list; and, what\nwas more a subject of unceasing regret to Mr Benson than all, the\ndefection of some of the members of his congregation, who followed\nMr Bradshaw's lead. Their places, to be sure, were more than filled\nup by the poor, who thronged to his chapel; but still it was a\ndisappointment to find that people about whom he had been earnestly\nthinking--to whom he had laboured to do good--should dissolve the\nconnexion without a word of farewell or explanation. Mr Benson did\nnot wonder that they should go; nay, he even felt it right that they\nshould seek that spiritual help from another, which he, by his error,\nhad forfeited his power to offer; he only wished they had spoken of\ntheir intention to him in an open and manly way. But not the less did\nhe labour on among those to whom God permitted him to be of use. He\nfelt age stealing upon him apace, although he said nothing about\nit, and no one seemed to be aware of it; and he worked the more\ndiligently while \"it was yet day.\" It was not the number of his years\nthat made him feel old, for he was only sixty, and many men are hale\nand strong at that time of life; in all probability, it was that\nearly injury to his spine which affected the constitution of his mind\nas well as his body, and predisposed him, in the opinion of some at\nleast, to a feminine morbidness of conscience. He had shaken off\nsomewhat of this since the affair with Mr Bradshaw; he was simpler\nand more dignified than he had been for several years before, during\nwhich time he had been anxious and uncertain in his manner, and more\ngiven to thought than to action.\n\nThe one happy bright spot in this grey year was owing to Sally. As\nshe said of herself, she believed she grew more \"nattered\" as she\ngrew older; but that she was conscious of her \"natteredness\" was\na new thing, and a great gain to the comfort of the house, for it\nmade her very grateful for forbearance, and more aware of kindness\nthan she had ever been before. She had become very deaf; yet she\nwas uneasy and jealous if she were not informed of all the family\nthoughts, plans, and proceedings, which often had (however private in\ntheir details) to be shouted to her at the full pitch of the voice.\nBut she always heard Leonard perfectly. His clear and bell-like\nvoice, which was similar to his mother's, till sorrow had taken the\nring out of it, was sure to be heard by the old servant, though\nevery one else had failed. Sometimes, however, she \"got her hearing\nsudden,\" as she phrased it, and was alive to every word and noise,\nmore particularly when they did not want her to hear; and at such\ntimes she resented their continuance of the habit of speaking loud\nas a mortal offence. One day, her indignation at being thought deaf\ncalled out one of the rare smiles on Leonard's face; she saw it, and\nsaid, \"Bless thee, lad! if it but amuses thee, they may shout through\na ram's horn to me, and I'll never let on I'm not deaf. It's as good\na use as I can be of,\" she continued to herself, \"if I can make that\npoor lad smile a bit.\"\n\nIf she expected to be everybody's confidante, she made Leonard hers.\n\"There!\" said she, when she came home from her marketing one Saturday\nnight, \"look here, lad! Here's forty-two pound, seven shillings, and\ntwopence! It's a mint of money, isn't it? I took it all in sovereigns\nfor fear of fire.\"\n\n\"What is it all for, Sally?\" said he.\n\n\"Aye, lad! that's asking. It's Mr Benson's money,\" said she,\nmysteriously, \"that I've been keeping for him. Is he in the study,\nthink ye?\"\n\n\"Yes! I think so. Where have you been keeping it?\"\n\n\"Never you mind!\" She went towards the study, but thinking she might\nhave been hard on her darling in refusing to gratify his curiosity,\nshe turned back, and said:\n\n\"I say--if thou wilt, thou mayst do me a job of work some day. I'm\nwanting a frame made for a piece of writing.\"\n\nAnd then she returned to go into the study, carrying her sovereigns\nin her apron.\n\n\"Here, Master Thurstan,\" said she, pouring them out on the table\nbefore her astonished master. \"Take it, it's all yours.\"\n\n\"All mine! What can you mean?\" asked he, bewildered.\n\nShe did not hear him, and went on:\n\n\"Lock it up safe, out o' the way. Dunnot go and leave it about to\ntempt folks. I'll not answer for myself if money's left about. I may\nbe cribbing a sovereign.\"\n\n\"But where does it come from?\" said he.\n\n\"Come from!\" she replied. \"Where does all money come from, but the\nbank, to be sure? I thought any one could tell that.\"\n\n\"I have no money in the bank!\" said he, more and more perplexed.\n\n\"No! I knowed that; but I had. Dunnot ye remember how you would\nraise my wage, last Martinmas eighteen year? You and Faith were very\nheadstrong, but I was too deep for you. See thee! I went and put\nit i' th' bank. I was never going to touch it; and if I had died\nit would have been all right, for I'd a will made, all regular and\ntight--made by a lawyer (leastways he would have been a lawyer, if he\nhadn't got transported first). And now, thinks I, I think I'll just\ngo and get it out and give it 'em. Banks is not always safe.\"\n\n\"I'll take care of it for you with the greatest pleasure. Still, you\nknow, banks allow interest.\"\n\n\"D'ye suppose I don't know all about interest, and compound interest\ntoo, by this time? I tell ye I want ye to spend it. It's your own.\nIt's not mine. It always was yours. Now you're not going to fret me\nby saying you think it mine.\"\n\nMr Benson held out his hand to her, for he could not speak. She bent\nforward to him as he sat there, and kissed him.\n\n\"Eh, bless ye, lad! It's the first kiss I've had of ye sin' ye were\na little lad, and it's a great refreshment. Now don't you and Faith\ngo and bother me with talking about it. It's just yours, and make no\nmore ado.\"\n\nShe went back into the kitchen, and brought out her will, and gave\nLeonard directions how to make a frame for it; for the boy was a very\ntolerable joiner, and had a box of tools which Mr Bradshaw had given\nhim some years ago.\n\n\"It's a pity to lose such fine writing,\" said she; \"though I can't\nsay as I can read it. Perhaps you'd just read it for me, Leonard.\"\nShe sat open-mouthed with admiration at all the long words.\n\nThe frame was made, and the will hung up opposite to her bed, unknown\nto any one but Leonard; and, by dint of his repeated reading it over\nto her, she learnt all the words, except \"testatrix,\" which she would\nalways call \"testy tricks.\" Mr Benson had been too much gratified and\ntouched, by her unconditional gift of all she had in the world, to\nreject it; but he only held it in his hands as a deposit until he\ncould find a safe investment befitting so small a sum. The little\nrearrangements of the household expenditure had not touched him as\nthey had done the women. He was aware that meat dinners were not\nnow every-day occurrences; but he preferred puddings and vegetables,\nand was glad of the exchange. He observed, too, that they all sat\ntogether in the kitchen in the evenings; but the kitchen, with the\nwell-scoured dresser, the shining saucepans, the well-blacked grate\nand whitened hearth, and the warmth which seemed to rise up from the\nvery flags, and ruddily cheer the most distant corners, appeared a\nvery cozy and charming sitting-room; and, besides, it appeared but\nright that Sally, in her old age, should have the companionship of\nthose with whom she had lived in love and faithfulness for so many\nyears. He only wished he could more frequently leave the solitary\ncomfort of his study, and join the kitchen party, where Sally sat\nas mistress in the chimney-corner, knitting by fire-light, and Miss\nBenson and Ruth, with the candle between them, stitched away at their\nwork; while Leonard strewed the ample dresser with his slate and\nbooks. He did not mope and pine over his lessons; they were the\none thing that took him out of himself. As yet his mother could\nteach him, though in some respects it was becoming a strain upon her\nacquirements and powers. Mr Benson saw this, but reserved his offers\nof help as long as he could, hoping that before his assistance became\nabsolutely necessary, some mode of employment beyond that of\noccasional plain-work might be laid open to Ruth.\n\nIn spite of the communication they occasionally had with Mr Farquhar,\nwhen he gave them the intelligence of his engagement to Jemima, it\nseemed like a glimpse into a world from which they were shut out.\nThey wondered--Miss Benson and Ruth did at least--much about the\ndetails. Ruth sat over her sewing, fancying how all had taken place;\nand as soon as she had arranged the events which were going on\namong people and places once so familiar to her, she found some\ndiscrepancy, and set-to afresh to picture the declaration of love,\nand the yielding, blushing acceptance; for Mr Farquhar had told\nlittle beyond the mere fact that there was an engagement between\nhimself and Jemima which had existed for some time, but which had\nbeen kept secret until now, when it was acknowledged, sanctioned, and\nto be fulfilled as soon as he returned from an arrangement of family\naffairs in Scotland. This intelligence had been enough for Mr Benson,\nwho was the only person Mr Farquhar saw; as Ruth always shrank from\nthe post of opening the door, and Mr Benson was apt at recognising\nindividual knocks, and always prompt to welcome Mr Farquhar.\n\nMiss Benson occasionally thought--and what she thought she was in\nthe habit of saying--that Jemima might have come herself to announce\nsuch an event to old friends; but Mr Benson decidedly vindicated her\nfrom any charge of neglect, by expressing his strong conviction that\nto her they owed Mr Farquhar's calls--his all but outspoken offers\nof service--his quiet, steady interest in Leonard; and, moreover\n(repeating the conversation he had had with her in the street, the\nfirst time they met after the disclosure), Mr Benson told his sister\nhow glad he was to find that, with all the warmth of her impetuous\ndisposition hurrying her on to rebellion against her father, she was\nnow attaining to that just self-control which can distinguish between\nmere wishes and true reasons--that she could abstain from coming to\nsee Ruth while she could do but little good, reserving herself for\nsome great occasion or strong emergency.\n\nRuth said nothing, but she yearned all the more in silence to\nsee Jemima. In her recollection of that fearful interview with\nMr Bradshaw, which haunted her yet, sleeping or waking, she was\npainfully conscious that she had not thanked Jemima for her generous,\nloving advocacy; it had passed unregarded at the time in intensity\nof agony--but now she recollected that by no word, or tone, or touch,\nhad she given any sign of gratitude. Mr Benson had never told her of\nhis meeting with Jemima; so it seemed as if there were no hope of any\nfuture opportunity: for it is strange how two households, rent apart\nby some dissension, can go through life, their parallel existences\nrunning side by side, yet never touching each other, near neighbours\nas they are, habitual and familiar guests as they may have been.\n\nRuth's only point of hope was Leonard. She was weary of looking for\nwork and employment, which everywhere seemed held above her reach.\nShe was not impatient of this, but she was very, very sorry. She felt\nwithin her such capability, and all ignored her, and passed her by\non the other side. But she saw some progress in Leonard. Not that he\ncould continue to have the happy development, and genial ripening,\nwhich other boys have; leaping from childhood to boyhood, and thence\nto youth, with glad bounds, and unconsciously enjoying every age. At\npresent there was no harmony in Leonard's character; he was as full\nof thought and self-consciousness as many men, planning his actions\nlong beforehand, so as to avoid what he dreaded, and what she could\nnot yet give him strength to face, coward as she was herself, and\nshrinking from hard remarks. Yet Leonard was regaining some of his\nlost tenderness towards his mother; when they were alone he would\nthrow himself on her neck and smother her with kisses, without any\napparent cause for such a passionate impulse. If any one was by, his\nmanner was cold and reserved. The hopeful parts of his character were\nthe determination evident in him to be a \"law unto himself,\" and the\nserious thought which he gave to the formation of this law. There was\nan inclination in him to reason, especially and principally with Mr\nBenson, on the great questions of ethics which the majority of the\nworld have settled long ago. But I do not think he ever so argued\nwith his mother. Her lovely patience, and her humility, was earning\nits reward; and from her quiet piety, bearing sweetly the denial of\nher wishes--the refusal of her begging--the disgrace in which she\nlay, while others, less worthy, were employed--this, which perplexed\nhim, and almost angered him at first, called out his reverence at\nlast, and what she said he took for his law with proud humility;\nand thus softly, she was leading him up to God. His health was not\nstrong; it was not likely to be. He moaned and talked in his sleep,\nand his appetite was still variable, part of which might be owing\nto his preference of the hardest lessons to any outdoor exercise.\nBut this last unnatural symptom was vanishing before the assiduous\nkindness of Mr Farquhar, and the quiet but firm desire of his mother.\nNext to Ruth, Sally had perhaps the most influence over him; but\nhe dearly loved both Mr and Miss Benson; although he was reserved\non this, as on every point not purely intellectual. His was a hard\nchildhood, and his mother felt that it was so. Children bear any\nmoderate degree of poverty and privation cheerfully; but, in addition\nto a good deal of this, Leonard had to bear a sense of disgrace\nattaching to him and to the creature he loved best; this it was that\ntook out of him the buoyancy and natural gladness of youth, in a\nway which no scantiness of food or clothing, or want of any outward\ncomfort, could ever have done.\n\nTwo years had passed away--two long, eventless years. Something was\nnow going to happen, which touched their hearts very nearly, though\nout of their sight and hearing. Jemima was going to be married this\nAugust, and by-and-by the very day was fixed. It was to be on the\n14th. On the evening of the 13th, Ruth was sitting alone in the\nparlour, idly gazing out on the darkening shadows in the little\ngarden; her eyes kept filling with quiet tears, that rose, not\nfor her own isolation from all that was going on of bustle and\npreparation for the morrow's event, but because she had seen how\nMiss Benson had felt that she and her brother were left out from\nthe gathering of old friends in the Bradshaw family. As Ruth sat,\nsuddenly she was aware of a figure by her; she started up, and in the\ngloom of the apartment she recognised Jemima. In an instant they were\nin each other's arms--a long, fast embrace.\n\n\"Can you forgive me?\" whispered Jemima in Ruth's ear.\n\n\"Forgive you! What do you mean? What have I to forgive? The question\nis, can I ever thank you as I long to do, if I could find words?\"\n\n\"Oh, Ruth, how I hated you once!\"\n\n\"It was all the more noble in you to stand by me as you did. You must\nhave hated me when you knew how I was deceiving you all!\"\n\n\"No, that was not it that made me hate you. It was before that. Oh,\nRuth, I did hate you!\"\n\nThey were silent for some time, still holding each other's hands.\nRuth spoke first.\n\n\"And you are going to be married to-morrow!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jemima. \"To-morrow, at nine o'clock. But I don't think\nI could have been married without coming to wish Mr Benson and Miss\nFaith good-bye.\"\n\n\"I will go for them,\" said Ruth.\n\n\"No, not just yet. I want to ask you one or two questions first.\nNothing very particular; only it seems as if there had been such a\nstrange, long separation between us. Ruth,\" said she, dropping her\nvoice, \"is Leonard stronger than he was? I was so sorry to hear about\nhim from Walter. But he is better?\" asked she, anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, he is better. Not what a boy of his age should be,\" replied\nhis mother, in a tone of quiet but deep mournfulness. \"Oh, Jemima!\"\ncontinued she, \"my sharpest punishment comes through him. To think\nwhat he might have been, and what he is!\"\n\n\"But Walter says he is both stronger in health, and not so--nervous\nand shy.\" Jemima added the last words in a hesitating and doubtful\nmanner, as if she did not know how to express her full meaning\nwithout hurting Ruth.\n\n\"He does not show that he feels his disgrace so much. I cannot talk\nabout it, Jemima, my heart aches so about him. But he is better,\" she\ncontinued, feeling that Jemima's kind anxiety required an answer at\nany cost of pain to herself. \"He is only studying too closely now; he\ntakes to his lessons evidently as a relief from thought. He is very\nclever, and I hope and trust, yet I tremble to say it, I believe he\nis very good.\"\n\n\"You must let him come and see us very often when we come back. We\nshall be two months away. We are going to Germany, partly on Walter's\nbusiness. Ruth, I have been talking to papa to-night, very seriously\nand quietly, and it has made me love him so much more, and understand\nhim so much better.\"\n\n\"Does he know of your coming here? I hope he does,\" said Ruth.\n\n\"Yes. Not that he liked my doing it at all. But, somehow, I can\nalways do things against a person's wishes more easily when I am\non good terms with them--that's not exactly what I meant; but now\nto-night, after papa had been showing me that he really loved me\nmore than I ever thought he had done (for I always fancied he was so\nabsorbed in Dick, he did not care much for us girls), I felt brave\nenough to say that I intended to come here and bid you all good-bye.\nHe was silent for a minute, and then said I might do it, but I must\nremember he did not approve of it, and was not to be compromised by\nmy coming; still I can tell that, at the bottom of his heart, there\nis some of the old kindly feeling to Mr and Miss Benson, and I don't\ndespair of its all being made up, though, perhaps, I ought to say\nthat mamma does.\"\n\n\"Mr and Miss Benson won't hear of my going away,\" said Ruth, sadly.\n\n\"They are quite right.\"\n\n\"But I am earning nothing. I cannot get any employment. I am only a\nburden and an expense.\"\n\n\"Are you not also a pleasure? And Leonard, is he not a dear object of\nlove? It is easy for me to talk, I know, who am so impatient. Oh, I\nnever deserved to be so happy as I am! You don't know how good Walter\nis. I used to think him so cold and cautious. But now, Ruth, will you\ntell Mr and Miss Benson that I am here? There is signing of papers,\nand I don't know what to be done at home. And when I come back, I\nhope to see you often, if you'll let me.\"\n\nMr and Miss Benson gave her a warm greeting. Sally was called in,\nand would bring a candle with her, to have a close inspection of\nher, in order to see if she was changed--she had not seen her for\nso long a time, she said; and Jemima stood laughing and blushing in\nthe middle of the room, while Sally studied her all over, and would\nnot be convinced that the old gown which she was wearing for the\nlast time was not one of the new wedding ones. The consequence of\nwhich misunderstanding was, that Sally, in her short petticoats and\nbedgown, turned up her nose at the old-fashioned way in which Miss\nBradshaw's gown was made. But Jemima knew the old woman, and rather\nenjoyed the contempt for her dress. At last she kissed them all, and\nran away to her impatient Mr Farquhar, who was awaiting her.\n\nNot many weeks after this, the poor old woman whom I have named\nas having become a friend of Ruth's, during Leonard's illness\nthree years ago, fell down and broke her hip-bone. It was a\nserious--probably a fatal injury, for one so old; and as soon as\nRuth heard of it she devoted all her leisure time to old Ann Fleming.\nLeonard had now outstript his mother's powers of teaching, and Mr\nBenson gave him his lessons; so Ruth was a great deal at the cottage\nboth night and day.\n\nThere Jemima found her one November evening, the second after their\nreturn from their prolonged stay on the Continent. She and Mr\nFarquhar had been to the Bensons, and had sat there some time; and\nnow Jemima had come on just to see Ruth for five minutes, before the\nevening was too dark for her to return alone. She found Ruth sitting\non a stool before the fire, which was composed of a few sticks on the\nhearth. The blaze they gave was, however, enough to enable her to\nread; and she was deep in study of the Bible, in which she had read\naloud to the poor old woman, until the latter had fallen asleep.\nJemima beckoned her out, and they stood on the green just before the\nopen door, so that Ruth could see if Ann awoke.\n\n\"I have not many minutes to stay, only I felt as if I must see you.\nAnd we want Leonard to come to us to see all our German purchases,\nand hear all our German adventures. May he come to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yes; thank you. Oh! Jemima, I have heard something--I have got a\nplan that makes me so happy! I have not told any one yet. But Mr\nWynne (the parish doctor, you know) has asked me if I would go out as\na sick nurse--he thinks he could find me employment.\"\n\n\"You, a sick nurse!\" said Jemima, involuntarily glancing over the\nbeautiful lithe figure, and the lovely refinement of Ruth's face as\nthe light of the rising moon fell upon it. \"My dear Ruth, I don't\nthink you are fitted for it!\"\n\n\"Don't you?\" said Ruth, a little disappointed. \"I think I am; at\nleast, that I should be very soon. I like being about sick and\nhelpless people; I always feel so sorry for them; and then I think I\nhave the gift of a very delicate touch, which is such a comfort in\nmany cases. And I should try to be very watchful and patient. Mr\nWynne proposed it himself.\"\n\n\"It was not in that way I meant you were not fitted for it. I meant\nthat you were fitted for something better. Why, Ruth, you are better\neducated than I am!\"\n\n\"But if nobody will allow me to teach?--for that is what I suppose\nyou mean. Besides, I feel as if all my education would be needed to\nmake me a good sick nurse.\"\n\n\"Your knowledge of Latin, for instance,\" said Jemima, hitting, in\nher vexation at the plan, on the first acquirement of Ruth she could\nthink of.\n\n\"Well!\" said Ruth, \"that won't come amiss; I can read the\nprescriptions.\"\n\n\"Which the doctors would rather you did not do.\"\n\n\"Still, you can't say that any knowledge of any kind will be in my\nway, or will unfit me for my work.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. But all your taste and refinement will be in your way,\nand will unfit you.\"\n\n\"You have not thought about this so much as I have, or you would not\nsay so. Any fastidiousness I shall have to get rid of, and I shall\nbe better without; but any true refinement I am sure I shall find\nof use; for don't you think that every power we have may be made to\nhelp us in any right work, whatever that is? Would you not rather be\nnursed by a person who spoke gently and moved quietly about than by a\nloud bustling woman?\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure; but a person unfit for anything else may move\nquietly, and speak gently, and give medicine when the doctor orders\nit, and keep awake at night; and those are the best qualities I ever\nheard of in a sick nurse.\"\n\nRuth was quite silent for some time. At last she said: \"At any rate\nit is work, and as such I am thankful for it. You cannot discourage\nme--and perhaps you know too little of what my life has been--how set\napart in idleness I have been--to sympathise with me fully.\"\n\n\"And I wanted you to come to see us--me in my new home. Walter and I\nhad planned that we would persuade you to come to us very often\" (she\nhad planned, and Mr Farquhar had consented); \"and now you will have\nto be fastened up in a sick-room.\"\n\n\"I could not have come,\" said Ruth quickly. \"Dear Jemima! it is like\nyou to have thought of it--but I could not come to your house. It is\nnot a thing to reason about. It is just feeling. But I do feel as if\nI could not go. Dear Jemima! if you are ill or sorrowful, and want\nme, I will come--\"\n\n\"So you would and must to any one, if you take up that calling.\"\n\n\"But I should come to you, love, in quite a different way; I should\ngo to you with my heart full of love--so full that I am afraid I\nshould be too anxious.\"\n\n\"I almost wish I were ill, that I might make you come at once.\"\n\n\"And I am almost ashamed to think how I should like you to be in some\nposition in which I could show you how well I remember that day--that\nterrible day in the school-room. God bless you for it, Jemima!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nThe Forged Deed\n\n\nMr Wynne, the parish surgeon, was right. He could and did obtain\nemployment for Ruth as a sick nurse. Her home was with the Bensons;\nevery spare moment was given to Leonard and to them; but she was\nat the call of all the invalids in the town. At first her work lay\nexclusively among the paupers. At first, too, there was a recoil\nfrom many circumstances, which impressed upon her the most fully the\nphysical sufferings of those whom she tended. But she tried to lose\nthe sense of these--or rather to lessen them, and make them take\ntheir appointed places--in thinking of the individuals themselves,\nas separate from their decaying frames; and all along she had\nenough self-command to control herself from expressing any sign of\nrepugnance. She allowed herself no nervous haste of movement or\ntouch that should hurt the feelings of the poorest, most friendless\ncreature, who ever lay a victim to disease. There was no rough\ngetting over of all the disagreeable and painful work of her\nemployment. When it was a lessening of pain to have the touch careful\nand delicate, and the ministration performed with gradual skill, Ruth\nthought of her charge, and not of herself. As she had foretold, she\nfound a use for all her powers. The poor patients themselves were\nunconsciously gratified and soothed by her harmony and refinement of\nmanner, voice, and gesture. If this harmony and refinement had been\nmerely superficial, it would not have had this balmy effect. That\narose from its being the true expression of a kind, modest, and\nhumble spirit. By degrees her reputation as a nurse spread upwards,\nand many sought her good offices who could well afford to pay for\nthem. Whatever remuneration was offered to her, she took it simply\nand without comment; for she felt that it was not hers to refuse;\nthat it was, in fact, owing to the Bensons for her and her child's\nsubsistence. She went wherever her services were first called for.\nIf the poor bricklayer, who broke both his legs in a fall from the\nscaffolding, sent for her when she was disengaged, she went and\nremained with him until he could spare her, let who would be the next\nclaimant. From the happy and prosperous in all but health, she would\noccasionally beg off, when some one less happy and more friendless\nwished for her; and sometimes she would ask for a little money\nfrom Mr Benson to give to such in their time of need. But it was\nastonishing how much she was able to do without money.\n\nHer ways were very quiet; she never spoke much. Any one who has been\noppressed with the weight of a vital secret for years, and much more\nany one the character of whose life has been stamped by one event,\nand that producing sorrow and shame, is naturally reserved. And yet\nRuth's silence was not like reserve; it was too gentle and tender\nfor that. It had more the effect of a hush of all loud or disturbing\nemotions, and out of the deep calm the words that came forth had a\nbeautiful power. She did not talk much about religion; but those\nwho noticed her knew that it was the unseen banner which she was\nfollowing. The low-breathed sentences which she spoke into the ear of\nthe sufferer and the dying carried them upwards to God.\n\nShe gradually became known and respected among the roughest boys of\nthe rough populace of the town. They would make way for her when she\npassed along the streets with more deference than they used to most;\nfor all knew something of the tender care with which she had attended\nthis or that sick person, and, besides, she was so often in connexion\nwith Death that something of the superstitious awe with which the\ndead were regarded by those rough boys in the midst of their strong\nlife, surrounded her.\n\nShe herself did not feel changed. She felt just as faulty--as far\nfrom being what she wanted to be, as ever. She best knew how many\nof her good actions were incomplete, and marred with evil. She did\nnot feel much changed from the earliest Ruth she could remember.\nEverything seemed to change but herself. Mr and Miss Benson grew old,\nand Sally grew deaf, and Leonard was shooting up, and Jemima was\na mother. She and the distant hills that she saw from her chamber\nwindow, seemed the only things which were the same as when she first\ncame to Eccleston. As she sat looking out, and taking her fill of\nsolitude, which sometimes was her most thorough rest--as she sat at\nthe attic window looking abroad--she saw their next-door neighbour\ncarried out to sun himself in his garden. When she first came to\nEccleston, this neighbour and his daughter were often seen taking\nlong and regular walks; by-and-by his walks became shorter, and the\nattentive daughter would convoy him home, and set out afresh to\nfinish her own. Of late years he had only gone out in the garden\nbehind his house; but at first he had walked pretty briskly there\nby his daughter's help--now he was carried, and placed in a large,\ncushioned easy-chair, his head remaining where it was placed against\nthe pillow, and hardly moving when his kind daughter, who was now\nmiddle-aged, brought him the first roses of the summer. This told\nRuth of the lapse of life and time.\n\nMr and Mrs Farquhar were constant in their attentions; but there was\nno sign of Mr Bradshaw ever forgiving the imposition which had been\npractised upon him, and Mr Benson ceased to hope for any renewal of\ntheir intercourse. Still, he thought that he must know of all the\nkind attentions which Jemima paid to them, and of the fond regard\nwhich both she and her husband bestowed on Leonard. This latter\nfeeling even went so far that Mr Farquhar called one day, and with\nmuch diffidence begged Mr Benson to urge Ruth to let him be sent to\nschool at his (Mr Farquhar's) expense.\n\nMr Benson was taken by surprise, and hesitated. \"I do not know. It\nwould be a great advantage in some respects; and yet I doubt whether\nit would in others. His mother's influence over him is thoroughly\ngood, and I should fear that any thoughtless allusions to his\npeculiar position might touch the raw spot in his mind.\"\n\n\"But he is so unusually clever, it seems a shame not to give him all\nthe advantages he can have. Besides, does he see much of his mother\nnow?\"\n\n\"Hardly a day passes without her coming home to be an hour or so with\nhim, even at her busiest times; she says it is her best refreshment.\nAnd often, you know, she is disengaged for a week or two, except the\noccasional services which she is always rendering to those who need\nher. Your offer is very tempting, but there is so decidedly another\nview of the question to be considered, that I believe we must refer\nit to her.\"\n\n\"With all my heart. Don't hurry her to a decision. Let her weigh it\nwell. I think she will find the advantages preponderate.\"\n\n\"I wonder if I might trouble you with a little business, Mr Farquhar,\nas you are here?\"\n\n\"Certainly; I am only too glad to be of any use to you.\"\n\n\"Why, I see from the report of the Star Life Assurance Company in the\n_Times_, which you are so good as to send me, that they have declared\na bonus on the shares; now it seems strange that I have received no\nnotification of it, and I thought that perhaps it might be lying at\nyour office, as Mr Bradshaw was the purchaser of the shares, and I\nhave always received the dividends through your firm.\"\n\nMr Farquhar took the newspaper, and ran his eye over the report.\n\n\"I've no doubt that's the way of it,\" said he. \"Some of our clerks\nhave been careless about it; or it may be Richard himself. He is not\nalways the most punctual and exact of mortals; but I'll see about it.\nPerhaps after all it mayn't come for a day or two; they have always\nsuch numbers of these circulars to send out.\"\n\n\"Oh! I'm in no hurry about it. I only want to receive it some time\nbefore I incur any expenses, which the promise of this bonus may\ntempt me to indulge in.\"\n\nMr Farquhar took his leave. That evening there was a long conference,\nfor, as it happened, Ruth was at home. She was strenuously\nagainst the school plan. She could see no advantages that would\ncounterbalance the evil which she dreaded from any school for\nLeonard; namely, that the good opinion and regard of the world would\nassume too high an importance in his eyes. The very idea seemed to\nproduce in her so much shrinking affright, that by mutual consent\nthe subject was dropped; to be taken up again, or not, according to\ncircumstances.\n\nMr Farquhar wrote the next morning, on Mr Benson's behalf, to the\nInsurance Company, to inquire about the bonus. Although he wrote\nin the usual formal way, he did not think it necessary to tell Mr\nBradshaw what he had done; for Mr Benson's name was rarely mentioned\nbetween the partners; each had been made fully aware of the views\nwhich the other entertained on the subject that had caused the\nestrangement; and Mr Farquhar felt that no external argument could\naffect Mr Bradshaw's resolved disapproval and avoidance of his former\nminister.\n\nAs it happened, the answer from the Insurance Company (directed to\nthe firm) was given to Mr Bradshaw along with the other business\nletters. It was to the effect that Mr Benson's shares had been sold\nand transferred above a twelvemonth ago, which sufficiently accounted\nfor the circumstance that no notification of the bonus had been sent\nto him.\n\nMr Bradshaw tossed the letter on one side, not displeased to have\na good reason for feeling a little contempt at the unbusiness-like\nforgetfulness of Mr Benson, at whose instance some one had evidently\nbeen writing to the Insurance Company. On Mr Farquhar's entrance he\nexpressed this feeling to him.\n\n\"Really,\" he said, \"these Dissenting ministers have no more notion of\nexactitude in their affairs than a child! The idea of forgetting that\nhe has sold his shares, and applying for the bonus, when it seems he\nhas transferred them only a year ago!\"\n\nMr Farquhar was reading the letter while Mr Bradshaw spoke.\n\n\"I don't quite understand it,\" said he. \"Mr Benson was quite clear\nabout it. He could not have received his half-yearly dividends unless\nhe had been possessed of these shares; and I don't suppose Dissenting\nministers, with all their ignorance of business, are unlike other men\nin knowing whether or not they receive the money that they believe to\nbe owing to them.\"\n\n\"I should not wonder if they were--if Benson was, at any rate. Why,\nI never knew his watch to be right in all my life--it was always too\nfast or too slow; it must have been a daily discomfort to him. It\nought to have been. Depend upon it, his money matters are just in the\nsame irregular state; no accounts kept, I'll be bound.\"\n\n\"I don't see that that follows,\" said Mr Farquhar, half amused.\n\"That watch of his is a very curious one--belonged to his father and\ngrandfather, I don't know how far back.\"\n\n\"And the sentimental feelings which he is guided by prompt him to\nkeep it, to the inconvenience of himself and every one else.\"\n\nMr Farquhar gave up the subject of the watch as hopeless.\n\n\"But about this letter. I wrote, at Mr Benson's desire, to the\nInsurance Office, and I am not satisfied with this answer. All the\ntransaction has passed through our hands. I do not think it is likely\nMr Benson would write and sell the shares without, at any rate,\ninforming us at the time, even though he forgot all about it\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"Probably he told Richard, or Mr Watson.\"\n\n\"We can ask Mr Watson at once. I am afraid we must wait till Richard\ncomes home, for I don't know where a letter would catch him.\"\n\nMr Bradshaw pulled the bell that rang into the head-clerk's room,\nsaying as he did so,\n\n\"You may depend upon it, Farquhar, the blunder lies with\nBenson himself. He is just the man to muddle away his money in\nindiscriminate charity, and then to wonder what has become of it.\"\n\nMr Farquhar was discreet enough to hold his tongue.\n\n\"Mr Watson,\" said Mr Bradshaw, as the old clerk made his appearance,\n\"here is some mistake about those Insurance shares we purchased for\nBenson ten or a dozen years ago. He spoke to Mr Farquhar about some\nbonus they are paying to the shareholders, it seems; and, in reply to\nMr Farquhar's letter, the Insurance Company say the shares were sold\ntwelve months since. Have you any knowledge of the transaction? Has\nthe transfer passed through your hands? By the way\" (turning to Mr\nFarquhar), \"who kept the certificates? Did Benson or we?\"\n\n\"I really don't know,\" said Mr Farquhar. \"Perhaps Mr Watson can tell\nus.\"\n\nMr Watson meanwhile was studying the letter. When he had ended it, he\ntook off his spectacles, wiped them, and replacing them, he read it\nagain.\n\n\"It seems very strange, sir,\" he said at length, with his trembling,\naged voice, \"for I paid Mr Benson the account of the dividends myself\nlast June, and got a receipt in form, and that is since the date of\nthe alleged transfer.\"\n\n\"Pretty nearly twelve months after it took place,\" said Mr Farquhar.\n\n\"How did you receive the dividends? An order on the Bank, along with\nold Mrs Cranmer's?\" asked Mr Bradshaw, sharply.\n\n\"I don't know how they came. Mr Richard gave me the money, and\ndesired me to get the receipt.\"\n\n\"It's unlucky Richard is from home,\" said Mr Bradshaw. \"He could have\ncleared up this mystery for us.\"\n\nMr Farquhar was silent.\n\n\"Do you know where the certificates were kept, Mr Watson?\" said he.\n\n\"I'll not be sure, but I think they were with Mrs Cranmer's papers\nand deeds in box A, 24.\"\n\n\"I wish old Cranmer would have made any other man his executor. She,\ntoo, is always coming with some unreasonable request or other.\"\n\n\"Mr Benson's inquiry about his bonus is perfectly reasonable, at any\nrate.\"\n\nMr Watson, who was dwelling in the slow fashion of age on what had\nbeen said before, now spoke:\n\n\"I'll not be sure, but I am almost certain, Mr Benson said, when I\npaid him last June, that he thought he ought to give the receipt on\na stamp, and had spoken about it to Mr Richard the time before, but\nthat Mr Richard said it was of no consequence. Yes,\" continued he,\ngathering up his memory as he went on, \"he did--I remember now--and\nI thought to myself that Mr Richard was but a young man. Mr Richard\nwill know all about it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr Farquhar, gravely.\n\n\"I shan't wait till Richard's return,\" said Mr Bradshaw. \"We can soon\nsee if the certificates are in the box Watson points out; if they are\nthere, the Insurance people are no more fit to manage their concern\nthan that cat, and I shall tell them so. If they are not there (as\nI suspect will prove to be the case), it is just forgetfulness on\nBenson's part, as I have said from the first.\"\n\n\"You forget the payment of the dividends,\" said Mr Farquhar, in a low\nvoice.\n\n\"Well, sir! what then?\" said Mr Bradshaw, abruptly. While he\nspoke--while his eye met Mr Farquhar's--the hinted meaning of the\nlatter flashed through his mind; but he was only made angry to find\nthat such a suspicion could pass through any one's imagination.\n\n\"I suppose I may go, sir,\" said Watson, respectfully, an uneasy\nconsciousness of what was in Mr Farquhar's thoughts troubling the\nfaithful old clerk.\n\n\"Yes. Go. What do you mean about the dividends?\" asked Mr Bradshaw,\nimpetuously of Mr Farquhar.\n\n\"Simply, that I think there can have been no forgetfulness--no\nmistake on Mr Benson's part,\" said Mr Farquhar, unwilling to put his\ndim suspicion into words.\n\n\"Then of course it is some blunder of that confounded Insurance\nCompany. I will write to them to-day, and make them a little brisker\nand more correct in their statements.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it would be better to wait till Richard's return? He\nmay be able to explain it.\"\n\n\"No, sir!\" said Mr Bradshaw, sharply. \"I do not think it would be\nbetter. It has not been my way of doing business to spare any one,\nor any company, the consequences of their own carelessness; nor to\nobtain information second-hand when I could have it direct from the\nsource. I shall write to the Insurance Office by the next post.\"\n\nMr Farquhar saw that any further remonstrance on his part would\nonly aggravate his partner's obstinacy; and, besides, it was but a\nsuspicion--an uncomfortable suspicion. It was possible that some of\nthe clerks at the Insurance Office might have made a mistake. Watson\nwas not sure, after all, that the certificates had been deposited in\nbox A, 24; and when he and Mr Farquhar could not find them there,\nthe old man drew more and yet more back from his first assertion of\nbelief that they had been placed there.\n\nMr Bradshaw wrote an angry and indignant reproach of carelessness to\nthe Insurance Company. By the next mail one of their clerks came down\nto Eccleston; and having leisurely refreshed himself at the inn, and\nordered his dinner with care, he walked up to the great warehouse of\nBradshaw and Co., and sent in his card, with a pencil notification,\n\"On the part of the Star Insurance Company,\" to Mr Bradshaw himself.\n\nMr Bradshaw held the card in his hand for a minute or two without\nraising his eyes. Then he spoke out loud and firm:\n\n\"Desire the gentleman to walk up. Stay! I will ring my bell in a\nminute or two, and then show him upstairs.\"\n\nWhen the errand-boy had closed the door, Mr Bradshaw went to a\ncupboard where he usually kept a glass and a bottle of wine (of which\nhe very seldom partook, for he was an abstemious man). He intended\nnow to take a glass, but the bottle was empty; and though there was\nplenty more to be had for ringing, or even simply going into another\nroom, he would not allow himself to do this. He stood and lectured\nhimself in thought.\n\n\"After all, I am a fool for once in my life. If the certificates are\nin no box which I have yet examined, that does not imply they may not\nbe in some one which I have not had time to search. Farquhar would\nstay so late last night! And even if they are in none of the boxes\nhere, that does not prove--\" He gave the bell a jerking ring, and it\nwas yet sounding when Mr Smith, the insurance clerk, entered.\n\nThe manager of the Insurance Company had been considerably nettled at\nthe tone of Mr Bradshaw's letter; and had instructed the clerk to\nassume some dignity at first in vindicating (as it was well in his\npower to do) the character of the proceedings of the Company, but\nat the same time he was not to go too far, for the firm of Bradshaw\nand Co. was daily looming larger in the commercial world, and if any\nreasonable explanation could be given it was to be received, and\nbygones be bygones.\n\n\"Sit down, sir!\" said Mr Bradshaw.\n\n\"You are aware, sir, I presume, that I come on the part of Mr\nDennison, the manager of the Star Insurance Company, to reply in\nperson to a letter of yours, of the 29th, addressed to him?\"\n\nMr Bradshaw bowed. \"A very careless piece of business,\" he said,\nstiffly.\n\n\"Mr Dennison does not think you will consider it as such when you\nhave seen the deed of transfer, which I am commissioned to show you.\"\n\nMr Bradshaw took the deed with a steady hand. He wiped his spectacles\nquietly, without delay, and without hurry, and adjusted them on his\nnose. It is possible that he was rather long in looking over the\ndocument--at least, the clerk had just begun to wonder if he was\nreading through the whole of it, instead of merely looking at the\nsignature, when Mr Bradshaw said: \"It is possible that it may be--of\ncourse, you will allow me to take this paper to Mr Benson, to--to\ninquire if this be his signature?\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt of it, I think, sir,\" said the clerk, calmly\nsmiling, for he knew Mr Benson's signature well.\n\n\"I don't know, sir--I don't know.\" (He was speaking as if the\npronunciation of every word required a separate effort of will, like\na man who has received a slight paralytic stroke.)\n\n\"You have heard, sir, of such a thing as forgery--forgery, sir?\" said\nhe, repeating the last word very distinctly; for he feared that the\nfirst time he had said it, it was rather slurred over.\n\n\"Oh, sir! there is no room for imagining such a thing, I assure you.\nIn our affairs we become aware of curious forgetfulness on the part\nof those who are not of business habits.\"\n\n\"Still I should like to show it Mr Benson, to prove to him his\nforgetfulness, you know. I believe, on my soul, it is some of his\ncareless forgetfulness--I do, sir,\" said he. Now he spoke very\nquickly. \"It must have been. Allow me to convince myself. You shall\nhave it back to-night, or the first thing in the morning.\"\n\nThe clerk did not quite like to relinquish the deed, nor yet did\nhe like to refuse Mr Bradshaw. If that very uncomfortable idea of\nforgery should have any foundation in truth--and he had given up\nthe writing! There were a thousand chances to one against its being\nanything but a stupid blunder; the risk was more imminent of\noffending one of the directors.\n\nAs he hesitated, Mr Bradshaw spoke, very calmly, and almost with\na smile on his face. He had regained his self-command. \"You are\nafraid, I see. I assure you, you may trust me. If there has been any\nfraud--if I have the slightest suspicion of the truth of the surmise\nI threw out just now,\"--he could not quite speak the bare naked word\nthat was chilling his heart--\"I will not fail to aid the ends of\njustice, even though the culprit should be my own son.\"\n\nHe ended, as he began, with a smile--such a smile!--the stiff lips\nrefused to relax and cover the teeth. But all the time he kept saying\nto himself:\n\n\"I don't believe it--I don't believe it. I'm convinced it's a blunder\nof that old fool Benson.\"\n\nBut when he had dismissed the clerk, and secured the piece of paper,\nhe went and locked the door, and laid his head on his desk, and\nmoaned aloud.\n\nHe had lingered in the office for the two previous nights; at first,\noccupying himself in searching for the certificates of the Insurance\nshares; but, when all the boxes and other repositories for papers had\nbeen ransacked, the thought took hold of him that they might be in\nRichard's private desk; and, with the determination which overlooks\nthe means to get at the end, he had first tried all his own keys on\nthe complicated lock, and then broken it open with two decided blows\nof a poker, the instrument nearest at hand. He did not find the\ncertificates. Richard had always considered himself careful in\ndestroying any dangerous or tell-tale papers; but the stern father\nfound enough, in what remained, to convince him that his pattern\nson--more even than his pattern son, his beloved pride--was far other\nthan what he seemed.\n\nMr Bradshaw did not skip or miss a word. He did not shrink while he\nread. He folded up letter by letter; he snuffed the candle just when\nits light began to wane, and no sooner; but he did not miss or omit\none paper--he read every word. Then, leaving the letters in a heap\nupon the table, and the broken desk to tell its own tale, he locked\nthe door of the room which was appropriated to his son as junior\npartner, and carried the key away with him.\n\nThere was a faint hope, even after this discovery of many\ncircumstances of Richard's life which shocked and dismayed his\nfather--there was still a faint hope that he might not be guilty of\nforgery--that it might be no forgery after all--only a blunder--an\nomission--a stupendous piece of forgetfulness. That hope was the one\nstraw that Mr Bradshaw clung to.\n\nLate that night Mr Benson sat in his study. Every one else in the\nhouse had gone to bed; but he was expecting a summons to someone\nwho was dangerously ill. He was not startled, therefore, at the\nknock which came to the front door about twelve; but he was rather\nsurprised at the character of the knock, so slow and loud, with a\npause between each rap. His study-door was but a step from that which\nled into the street. He opened it, and there stood--Mr Bradshaw; his\nlarge, portly figure not to be mistaken even in the dusky night.\n\nHe said, \"That is right. It was you I wanted to see.\" And he walked\nstraight into the study. Mr Benson followed, and shut the door. Mr\nBradshaw was standing by the table, fumbling in his pocket. He pulled\nout the deed; and opening it, after a pause, in which you might have\ncounted five, he held it out to Mr Benson.\n\n\"Read it!\" said he. He spoke not another word until time had been\nallowed for its perusal. Then he added:\n\n\"That is your signature?\" The words were an assertion, but the tone\nwas that of question.\n\n\"No, it is not,\" said Mr Benson, decidedly. \"It is very like my\nwriting. I could almost say it was mine, but I know it is not.\"\n\n\"Recollect yourself a little. The date is August the third of last\nyear, fourteen months ago. You may have forgotten it.\" The tone of\nthe voice had a kind of eager entreaty in it, which Mr Benson did not\nnotice,--he was so startled at the fetch of his own writing.\n\n\"It is most singularly like mine; but I could not have signed away\nthese shares--all the property I have--without the slightest\nremembrance of it.\"\n\n\"Stranger things have happened. For the love of Heaven, think if you\ndid not sign it. It's a deed of transfer for those Insurance shares,\nyou see. You don't remember it? You did not write this name--these\nwords?\" He looked at Mr Benson with craving wistfulness for one\nparticular answer. Mr Benson was struck at last by the whole\nproceeding, and glanced anxiously at Mr Bradshaw, whose manner, gait,\nand voice were so different from usual that he might well excite\nattention. But as soon as the latter was aware of this momentary\ninspection, he changed his tone all at once.\n\n\"Don't imagine, sir, I wish to force any invention upon you as a\nremembrance. If you did not write this name, I know who did. Once\nmore I ask you,--does no glimmering recollection of--having needed\nmoney, we'll say--I never wanted you to refuse my subscription to the\nchapel, God knows!--of having sold these accursed shares?--Oh! I see\nby your face you did not write it; you need not speak to me--I know.\"\n\nHe sank down into a chair near him. His whole figure drooped. In a\nmoment he was up, and standing straight as an arrow, confronting Mr\nBenson, who could find no clue to this stern man's agitation.\n\n\"You say you did not write these words?\" pointing to the signature,\nwith an untrembling finger. \"I believe you; Richard Bradshaw did\nwrite them.\"\n\n\"My dear sir--my dear old friend!\" exclaimed Mr Benson, \"you are\nrushing to a conclusion for which, I am convinced, there is no\nfoundation; there is no reason to suppose that because--\"\n\n\"There is reason, sir. Do not distress yourself--I am perfectly\ncalm.\" His stony eyes and immovable face did indeed look rigid. \"What\nwe have now to do is to punish the offence. I have not one standard\nfor myself and those I love--(and, Mr Benson, I did love him)--and\nanother for the rest of the world. If a stranger had forged my\nname, I should have known it was my duty to prosecute him. You must\nprosecute Richard.\"\n\n\"I will not,\" said Mr Benson.\n\n\"You think, perhaps, that I shall feel it acutely. You are mistaken.\nHe is no longer as my son to me. I have always resolved to disown\nany child of mine who was guilty of sin. I disown Richard. He is\nas a stranger to me. I shall feel no more at his exposure--his\npunishment--\" He could not go on, for his voice was choking. \"Of\ncourse, you understand that I must feel shame at our connexion; it is\nthat that is troubling me; that is but consistent with a man who has\nalways prided himself on the integrity of his name; but as for that\nboy, who has been brought up all his life as I have brought up my\nchildren, it must be some innate wickedness! Sir, I can cut him off,\nthough he has been as my right hand--beloved. Let me be no hindrance\nto the course of justice, I beg. He has forged your name--he has\ndefrauded you of money--of your all, I think you said.\"\n\n\"Someone has forged my name. I am not convinced that it was your son.\nUntil I know all the circumstances, I decline to prosecute.\"\n\n\"What circumstances?\" asked Mr Bradshaw, in an authoritative manner,\nwhich would have shown irritation but for his self-command.\n\n\"The force of the temptation--the previous habits of the person--\"\n\n\"Of Richard. He is the person,\" Mr Bradshaw put in.\n\nMr Benson went on, without taking any notice. \"I should think it\nright to prosecute, if I found out that this offence against me was\nonly one of a series committed, with premeditation, against society.\nI should then feel, as a protector of others more helpless than\nmyself--\"\n\n\"It was your all,\" said Mr Bradshaw.\n\n\"It was all my money; it was not my all,\" replied Mr Benson; and\nthen he went on as if the interruption had never been: \"Against an\nhabitual offender. I shall not prosecute Richard. Not because he is\nyour son--do not imagine that! I should decline taking such a step\nagainst any young man without first ascertaining the particulars\nabout him, which I know already about Richard, and which determine me\nagainst doing what would blast his character for life--would destroy\nevery good quality he has.\"\n\n\"What good quality remains to him?\" asked Mr Bradshaw. \"He has\ndeceived me--he has offended God.\"\n\n\"Have we not all offended Him?\" Mr Benson said, in a low tone.\n\n\"Not consciously. I never do wrong consciously. But\nRichard--Richard.\" The remembrance of the undeceiving letters--the\nforgery--filled up his heart so completely that he could not speak\nfor a minute or two. Yet when he saw Mr Benson on the point of saying\nsomething, he broke in:\n\n\"It is no use talking, sir. You and I cannot agree on these subjects.\nOnce more, I desire you to prosecute that boy, who is no longer a\nchild of mine.\"\n\n\"Mr Bradshaw, I shall not prosecute him. I have said it once for all.\nTo-morrow you will be glad that I do not listen to you. I should only\ndo harm by saying more at present.\"\n\nThere is always something aggravating in being told, that the mood in\nwhich we are now viewing things strongly will not be our mood at some\nother time. It implies that our present feelings are blinding us, and\nthat some more clear-sighted spectator is able to distinguish our\nfuture better than we do ourselves. The most shallow person dislikes\nto be told that any one can gauge his depth. Mr Bradshaw was not\nsoothed by this last remark of Mr Benson's. He stooped down to take\nup his hat and be gone. Mr Benson saw his dizzy way of groping, and\ngave him what he sought for; but he received no word of thanks. Mr\nBradshaw went silently towards the door, but, just as he got there,\nhe turned round, and said:\n\n\"If there were more people like me, and fewer like you, there would\nbe less evil in the world, sir. It's your sentimentalists that nurse\nup sin.\"\n\nAlthough Mr Benson had been very calm during this interview, he had\nbeen much shocked by what had been let out respecting Richard's\nforgery; not by the fact itself so much as by what it was a sign of.\nStill, he had known the young man from childhood, and had seen, and\noften regretted, that his want of moral courage had rendered him\npeculiarly liable to all the bad effects arising from his father's\nsevere and arbitrary mode of treatment. Dick would never have had\n\"pluck\" enough to be a hardened villain, under any circumstances;\nbut, unless some good influence, some strength, was brought to bear\nupon him, he might easily sink into the sneaking scoundrel. Mr Benson\ndetermined to go to Mr Farquhar's the first thing in the morning, and\nconsult him as a calm, clear-headed family friend--partner in the\nbusiness, as well as son and brother-in-law to the people concerned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nAn Accident to the Dover Coach\n\n\nWhile Mr Benson lay awake for fear of oversleeping himself, and so\nbeing late at Mr Farquhar's (it was somewhere about six o'clock--dark\nas an October morning is at that time), Sally came to his door and\nknocked. She was always an early riser; and if she had not been gone\nto bed long before Mr Bradshaw's visit last night, Mr Benson might\nsafely have trusted to her calling him.\n\n\"Here's a woman down below as must see you directly. She'll be\nupstairs after me if you're not down quick.\"\n\n\"Is it any one from Clarke's?\"\n\n\"No, no! not it, master,\" said she, through the keyhole; \"I reckon\nit's Mrs Bradshaw, for all she's muffled up.\"\n\nHe needed no other word. When he went down, Mrs Bradshaw sat in\nhis easy-chair, swaying her body to and fro, and crying without\nrestraint. Mr Benson came up to her, before she was aware that he was\nthere.\n\n\"Oh! sir,\" said she, getting up and taking hold of both his\nhands, \"you won't be so cruel, will you? I have got some money\nsomewhere--some money my father settled on me, sir; I don't know how\nmuch, but I think it's more than two thousand pounds, and you shall\nhave it all. If I can't give it you now, I'll make a will, sir. Only\nbe merciful to poor Dick--don't go and prosecute him, sir.\"\n\n\"My dear Mrs Bradshaw, don't agitate yourself in this way. I never\nmeant to prosecute him.\"\n\n\"But Mr Bradshaw says that you must.\"\n\n\"I shall not, indeed. I have told Mr Bradshaw so.\"\n\n\"Has he been here? Oh! is not he cruel? I don't care. I've been a\ngood wife till now. I know I have. I have done all he bid me, ever\nsince we were married. But now I will speak my mind, and say to\neverybody how cruel he is--how hard to his own flesh and blood! If he\nputs poor Dick in prison, I will go too. If I'm to choose between my\nhusband and my son, I choose my son; for he will have no friends,\nunless I am with him.\"\n\n\"Mr Bradshaw will think better of it. You will see that, when his\nfirst anger and disappointment are over, he will not be hard or\ncruel.\"\n\n\"You don't know Mr Bradshaw,\" said she, mournfully, \"if you think\nhe'll change. I might beg and beg--I have done many a time, when we\nhad little children, and I wanted to save them a whipping--but no\nbegging ever did any good. At last I left it off. He'll not change.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not for human entreaty. Mrs Bradshaw, is there nothing more\npowerful?\"\n\nThe tone of his voice suggested what he did not say.\n\n\"If you mean that God may soften his heart,\" replied she, humbly,\n\"I'm not going to deny God's power--I have need to think of Him,\"\nshe continued, bursting into fresh tears, \"for I am a very miserable\nwoman. Only think! he cast it up against me last night, and said, if\nI had not spoilt Dick this never would have happened.\"\n\n\"He hardly knew what he was saying last night. I will go to Mr\nFarquhar's directly, and see him; and you had better go home, my dear\nMrs Bradshaw; you may rely upon our doing all that we can.\"\n\nWith some difficulty he persuaded her not to accompany him to Mr\nFarquhar's; but he had, indeed, to take her to her own door before he\ncould convince her that, at present, she could do nothing but wait\nthe result of the consultation of others.\n\nIt was before breakfast, and Mr Farquhar was alone; so Mr Benson had\na quiet opportunity of telling the whole story to the husband before\nthe wife came down. Mr Farquhar was not much surprised, though\ngreatly distressed. The general opinion he had always entertained\nof Richard's character had predisposed him to fear, even before the\ninquiry respecting the Insurance shares. But it was still a shock\nwhen it came, however much it might have been anticipated.\n\n\"What can we do?\" said Mr Benson, as Mr Farquhar sat gloomily silent.\n\n\"That is just what I was asking myself. I think I must see Mr\nBradshaw, and try and bring him a little out of this unmerciful frame\nof mind. That must be the first thing. Will you object to accompany\nme at once? It seems of particular consequence that we should subdue\nhis obduracy before the affair gets wind.\"\n\n\"I will go with you willingly. But I believe I rather serve to\nirritate Mr Bradshaw; he is reminded of things he has said to me\nformerly, and which he thinks he is bound to act up to. However, I\ncan walk with you to the door, and wait for you (if you'll allow\nme) in the street. I want to know how he is to-day, both bodily and\nmentally; for indeed, Mr Farquhar, I should not have been surprised\nlast night if he had dropped down dead, so terrible was his strain\nupon himself.\"\n\nMr Benson was left at the door as he had desired, while Mr Farquhar\nwent in.\n\n\"Oh, Mr Farquhar, what is the matter?\" exclaimed the girls, running\nto him. \"Mamma sits crying in the old nursery. We believe she has\nbeen there all night. She will not tell us what it is, nor let us be\nwith her; and papa is locked up in his room, and won't even answer us\nwhen we speak, though we know he is up and awake, for we heard him\ntramping about all night.\"\n\n\"Let me go up to him,\" said Mr Farquhar.\n\n\"He won't let you in. It will be of no use.\" But in spite of what\nthey said, he went up; and to their surprise, after hearing who it\nwas, their father opened the door, and admitted their brother-in-law.\nHe remained with Mr Bradshaw about half an hour, and then came into\nthe dining-room, where the two girls stood huddled over the fire,\nregardless of the untasted breakfast behind them; and, writing a few\nlines, he desired them to take his note up to their mother, saying it\nwould comfort her a little, and that he should send Jemima, in two or\nthree hours, with the baby--perhaps to remain some days with them. He\nhad no time to tell them more; Jemima would.\n\nHe left them, and rejoined Mr Benson. \"Come home and breakfast with\nme. I am off to London in an hour or two, and must speak with you\nfirst.\"\n\nOn reaching his house, he ran upstairs to ask Jemima to breakfast\nalone in her dressing-room, and returned in five minutes or less.\n\n\"Now I can tell you about it,\" said he. \"I see my way clearly to a\ncertain point. We must prevent Dick and his father meeting just now,\nor all hope of Dick's reformation is gone for ever. His father is as\nhard as the nether mill-stone. He has forbidden me his house.\"\n\n\"Forbidden you!\"\n\n\"Yes; because I would not give up Dick as utterly lost and bad; and\nbecause I said I should return to London with the clerk, and fairly\ntell Dennison (he's a Scotchman, and a man of sense and feeling) the\nreal state of the case. By the way, we must not say a word to the\nclerk; otherwise he will expect an answer, and make out all sorts of\ninferences for himself, from the unsatisfactory reply he must have.\nDennison will be upon honour--will see every side of the case--will\nknow you refuse to prosecute; the Company of which he is manager are\nno losers. Well! when I said what I thought wise, of all this--when\nI spoke as if my course were a settled and decided thing, the grim\nold man asked me if he was to be an automaton in his own house. He\nassured me he had no feeling for Dick--all the time he was shaking\nlike an aspen; in short, repeated much the same things he must have\nsaid to you last night. However, I defied him; and the consequence\nis, I'm forbidden the house, and, what is more, he says he will not\ncome to the office while I remain a partner.\"\n\n\"What shall you do?\"\n\n\"Send Jemima and the baby. There's nothing like a young child for\nbringing people round to a healthy state of feeling; and you don't\nknow what Jemima is, Mr Benson! No! though you've known her from her\nbirth. If she can't comfort her mother, and if the baby can't steal\ninto her grandfather's heart, why--I don't know what you may do to\nme. I shall tell Jemima all, and trust to her wit and wisdom to work\nat this end, while I do my best at the other.\"\n\n\"Richard is abroad, is not he?\"\n\n\"He will be in England to-morrow. I must catch him somewhere; but\nthat I can easily do. The difficult point will be, what to do with\nhim--what to say to him, when I find him. He must give up his\npartnership, that's clear. I did not tell his father so, but I am\nresolved upon it. There shall be no tampering with the honour of the\nfirm to which I belong.\"\n\n\"But what will become of him?\" asked Mr Benson, anxiously.\n\n\"I do not yet know. But, for Jemima's sake--for his dear old father's\nsake--I will not leave him adrift. I will find him some occupation\nas clear from temptation as I can. I will do all in my power. And he\nwill do much better, if he has any good in him, as a freer agent, not\ncowed by his father into a want of individuality and self-respect.\nI believe I must dismiss you, Mr Benson,\" said he, looking at his\nwatch; \"I have to explain all to my wife, and to go to that clerk.\nYou shall hear from me in a day or two.\"\n\nMr Benson half envied the younger man's elasticity of mind, and power\nof acting promptly. He himself felt as if he wanted to sit down\nin his quiet study, and think over the revelations and events of\nthe last twenty-four hours. It made him dizzy even to follow Mr\nFarquhar's plans, as he had briefly detailed them; and some solitude\nand consideration would be required before Mr Benson could decide\nupon their justice and wisdom. He had been much shocked by the\ndiscovery of the overt act of guilt which Richard had perpetrated,\nlow as his opinion of that young man had been for some time; and the\nconsequence was, that he felt depressed, and unable to rally for the\nnext few days. He had not even the comfort of his sister's sympathy,\nas he felt bound in honour not to tell her anything; and she was\nluckily so much absorbed in some household contest with Sally that\nshe did not notice her brother's quiet languor.\n\nMr Benson felt that he had no right at this time to intrude into the\nhouse which he had been once tacitly forbidden. If he went now to Mr\nBradshaw's without being asked, or sent for, he thought it would seem\nlike presuming on his knowledge of the hidden disgrace of one of the\nfamily. Yet he longed to go: he knew that Mr Farquhar must be writing\nalmost daily to Jemima, and he wanted to hear what he was doing. The\nfourth day after her husband's departure she came, within half an\nhour of the post-delivery, and asked to speak to Mr Benson alone.\n\nShe was in a state of great agitation, and had evidently been crying\nvery much.\n\n\"Oh, Mr Benson!\" said she, \"will you come with me, and tell papa this\nsad news about Dick? Walter has written me a letter at last to say he\nhas found him--he could not at first; but now it seems that, the day\nbefore yesterday, he heard of an accident which had happened to the\nDover coach; it was overturned--two passengers killed, and several\nbadly hurt. Walter says we ought to be thankful, as he is, that Dick\nwas not killed. He says it was such a relief to him on going to the\nplace--the little inn nearest to where the coach was overturned--to\nfind that Dick was only severely injured; not one of those who was\nkilled. But it is a terrible shock to us all. We had had no more\ndreadful fear to lessen the shock; mamma is quite unfit for anything,\nand we none of us dare to tell papa.\" Jemima had hard work to keep\ndown her sobs thus far, and now they overmastered her.\n\n\"How is your father? I have wanted to hear every day,\" asked Mr\nBenson, tenderly.\n\n\"It was careless of me not to come and tell you; but, indeed, I have\nhad so much to do. Mamma would not go near him. He has said something\nwhich she seems as if she could not forgive. Because he came to\nmeals, she would not. She has almost lived in the nursery; taking out\nall Dick's old playthings, and what clothes of his were left, and\nturning them over, and crying over them.\"\n\n\"Then Mr Bradshaw has joined you again; I was afraid, from what Mr\nFarquhar said, he was going to isolate himself from you all?\"\n\n\"I wish he had,\" said Jemima, crying afresh. \"It would have been more\nnatural than the way he has gone on; the only difference from his\nusual habits is, that he has never gone near the office, or else he\nhas come to meals just as usual, and talked just as usual; and even\ndone what I never knew him do before, tried to make jokes--all in\norder to show us how little he cares.\"\n\n\"Does he not go out at all?\"\n\n\"Only in the garden. I am sure he does care after all; he must care;\nhe cannot shake off a child in this way, though he thinks he can; and\nthat makes me so afraid of telling him of this accident. Will you\ncome, Mr Benson?\"\n\nHe needed no other word. He went with her, as she rapidly threaded\nher way through the by-streets. When they reached the house, she\nwent in without knocking, and putting her husband's letter into\nMr Benson's hand, she opened the door of her father's room, and\nsaying--\"Papa, here is Mr Benson,\" left them alone.\n\nMr Benson felt nervously incapable of knowing what to do, or to say.\nHe had surprised Mr Bradshaw sitting idly over the fire--gazing\ndreamily into the embers. But he had started up, and drawn his chair\nto the table, on seeing his visitor; and, after the first necessary\nwords of politeness were over, he seemed to expect him to open the\nconversation.\n\n\"Mrs Farquhar has asked me,\" said Mr Benson, plunging into the\nsubject with a trembling heart, \"to tell you about a letter she has\nreceived from her husband;\" he stopped for an instant, for he felt\nthat he did not get nearer the real difficulty, and yet could not\ntell the best way of approaching it.\n\n\"She need not have given you that trouble. I am aware of the reason\nof Mr Farquhar's absence. I entirely disapprove of his conduct. He is\nregardless of my wishes; and disobedient to the commands which, as my\nson-in-law, I thought he would have felt bound to respect. If there\nis any more agreeable subject that you can introduce, I shall be glad\nto hear you, sir.\"\n\n\"Neither you, nor I, must think of what we like to hear or to say.\nYou must hear what concerns your son.\"\n\n\"I have disowned the young man who was my son,\" replied he, coldly.\n\n\"The Dover coach has been overturned,\" said Mr Benson, stimulated\ninto abruptness by the icy sternness of the father. But, in a flash,\nhe saw what lay below that terrible assumption of indifference. Mr\nBradshaw glanced up in his face one look of agony--and then went\ngrey-pale; so livid that Mr Benson got up to ring the bell in\naffright, but Mr Bradshaw motioned to him to sit still.\n\n\"Oh! I have been too sudden, sir--he is alive, he is alive!\" he\nexclaimed, as he saw the ashy face working in a vain attempt to\nspeak; but the poor lips (so wooden, not a minute ago) went working\non and on, as if Mr Benson's words did not sink down into the mind,\nor reach the understanding. Mr Benson went hastily for Mrs Farquhar.\n\n\"Oh, Jemima!\" said he, \"I have done it so badly--I have been so\ncruel--he is very ill, I fear--bring water, brandy--\" and he returned\nwith all speed into the room. Mr Bradshaw--the great, strong, iron\nman--lay back in his chair in a swoon, a fit.\n\n\"Fetch my mother, Mary. Send for the doctor, Elizabeth,\" said Jemima,\nrushing to her father. She and Mr Benson did all in their power to\nrestore him. Mrs Bradshaw forgot all her vows of estrangement from\nthe dead-like husband, who might never speak to her, or hear her\nagain, and bitterly accused herself for every angry word she had\nspoken against him during these last few miserable days.\n\nBefore the doctor came, Mr Bradshaw had opened his eyes and partially\nrallied, although he either did not, or could not speak. He looked\nstruck down into old age. His eyes were sensible in their expression,\nbut had the dim glaze of many years of life upon them. His lower jaw\nfell from his upper one, giving a look of melancholy depression to\nthe face, although the lips hid the unclosed teeth. But he answered\ncorrectly (in monosyllables, it is true) all the questions which the\ndoctor chose to ask. And the medical man was not so much impressed\nwith the serious character of the seizure as the family, who knew\nall the hidden mystery behind, and had seen their father lie for the\nfirst time with the precursor aspect of death upon his face. Rest,\nwatching, and a little medicine were what the doctor prescribed; it\nwas so slight a prescription, for what had appeared to Mr Benson so\nserious an attack, that he wished to follow the medical man out of\nthe room to make further inquiries, and learn the real opinion which\nhe thought must lurk behind. But as he was following the doctor,\nhe--they all--were aware of the effort Mr Bradshaw was making to\nrise, in order to arrest Mr Benson's departure. He did stand up,\nsupporting himself with one hand on the table, for his legs shook\nunder him. Mr Benson came back instantly to the spot where he was.\nFor a moment it seemed as if he had not the right command of his\nvoice: but at last he said, with a tone of humble, wistful entreaty,\nwhich was very touching:\n\n\"He is alive, sir; is he not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir--indeed he is; he is only hurt. He is sure to do well. Mr\nFarquhar is with him,\" said Mr Benson, almost unable to speak for\ntears.\n\nMr Bradshaw did not remove his eyes from Mr Benson's face for more\nthan a minute after his question had been answered. He seemed as\nthough he would read his very soul, and there see if he spoke the\ntruth. Satisfied at last, he sank slowly into his chair; and they\nwere silent for a little space, waiting to perceive if he would wish\nfor any further information just then. At length he put his hands\nslowly together in the clasped attitude of prayer, and said--\"Thank\nGod!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nThe Bradshaw Pew Again Occupied\n\n\nIf Jemima allowed herself now and then to imagine that one good would\nresult from the discovery of Richard's delinquency, in the return of\nher father and Mr Benson to something of their old understanding and\ntheir old intercourse--if this hope fluttered through her mind, it\nwas doomed to disappointment. Mr Benson would have been most happy\nto go, if Mr Bradshaw had sent for him; he was on the watch for\nwhat might be even the shadow of such an invitation--but none came.\nMr Bradshaw, on his part, would have been thoroughly glad if the\nwilful seclusion of his present life could have been broken by the\noccasional visits of the old friend whom he had once forbidden the\nhouse; but this prohibition having passed his lips, he stubbornly\nrefused to do anything which might be construed into unsaying it.\nJemima was for some time in despair of his ever returning to the\noffice, or resuming his old habits of business. He had evidently\nthreatened as much to her husband. All that Jemima could do was to\nturn a deaf ear to every allusion to this menace, which he threw out\nfrom time to time, evidently with a view to see if it had struck deep\nenough into her husband's mind for him to have repeated it to his\nwife. If Mr Farquhar had named it--if it was known only to two or\nthree to have been, but for one half-hour even, his resolution--Mr\nBradshaw could have adhered to it, without any other reason than the\nmaintenance of what he called consistency, but which was in fact\ndoggedness. Jemima was often thankful that her mother was absent,\nand gone to nurse her son. If she had been at home, she would have\nentreated and implored her husband to fall back into his usual\nhabits, and would have shown such a dread of his being as good as his\nword, that he would have been compelled to adhere to it by the very\nconsequence affixed to it. Mr Farquhar had hard work, as it was,\nin passing rapidly enough between the two places--attending to his\nbusiness at Eccleston; and deciding, comforting, and earnestly\ntalking, in Richard's sick-room. During an absence of his, it\nwas necessary to apply to one of the partners on some matter of\nimportance; and accordingly, to Jemima's secret joy, Mr Watson came\nup and asked if her father was well enough to see him on business?\nJemima carried in this inquiry literally; and the hesitating answer\nwhich her father gave was in the affirmative. It was not long before\nshe saw him leave the house, accompanied by the faithful old clerk;\nand when he met her at dinner, he made no allusion to his morning\nvisitor, or to his subsequent going out. But from that time forwards\nhe went regularly to the office. He received all the information\nabout Dick's accident, and his progress towards recovery, in perfect\nsilence, and in as indifferent a manner as he could assume; but yet\nhe lingered about the family sitting-room every morning until the\npost had come in which brought all letters from the south.\n\nWhen Mr Farquhar at last returned to bring the news of Dick's perfect\nconvalescence, he resolved to tell Mr Bradshaw all that he had done\nand arranged for his son's future career; but, as Mr Farquhar told\nMr Benson afterwards, he could not really say if Mr Bradshaw had\nattended to one word that he said.\n\n\"Rely upon it,\" said Mr Benson, \"he has not only attended to it, but\ntreasured up every expression you have used.\"\n\n\"Well, I tried to get some opinion, or sign of emotion, out of him. I\nhad not much hope of the latter, I must own; but I thought he would\nhave said whether I had done wisely or not in procuring that Glasgow\nsituation for Dick--that he would, perhaps, have been indignant\nat my ousting him from the partnership so entirely on my own\nresponsibility.\"\n\n\"How did Richard take it?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing could exceed his penitence. If one had never heard of\nthe proverb, 'When the devil was sick, the devil a monk would be,' I\nshould have had greater faith in him; or if he had had more strength\nof character to begin with, or more reality and less outward\nappearance of good principle instilled into him. However, this\nGlasgow situation is the very thing; clear, defined duties, no great\ntrust reposed in him, a kind and watchful head, and introductions to\na better class of associates than I fancy he has ever been thrown\namongst before. For, you know, Mr Bradshaw dreaded all intimacies\nfor his son, and wanted him to eschew all society beyond his own\nfamily--would never allow him to ask a friend home. Really, when I\nthink of the unnatural life Mr Bradshaw expected him to lead, I get\ninto charity with him, and have hopes. By the way, have you ever\nsucceeded in persuading his mother to send Leonard to school? He\nmay run the same risk from isolation as Dick: not be able to choose\nhis companions wisely when he grows up, but be too much overcome\nby the excitement of society to be very discreet as to who are his\nassociates. Have you spoken to her about my plan?\"\n\n\"Yes! but to no purpose. I cannot say that she would even admit an\nargument on the subject. She seemed to have an invincible repugnance\nto the idea of exposing him to the remarks of other boys on his\npeculiar position.\"\n\n\"They need never know of it. Besides, sooner or later, he must step\nout of his narrow circle, and encounter remark and scorn.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Mr Benson, mournfully. \"And you may depend upon it,\nif it really is the best for Leonard, she will come round to it\nby-and-by. It is almost extraordinary to see the way in which her\nearnest and most unselfish devotion to this boy's real welfare leads\nher to right and wise conclusions.\"\n\n\"I wish I could tame her so as to let me meet her as a friend. Since\nthe baby was born, she comes to see Jemima. My wife tells me, that\nshe sits and holds it soft in her arms, and talks to it as if her\nwhole soul went out to the little infant. But if she hears a strange\nfootstep on the stair, what Jemima calls the 'wild-animal look'\ncomes back into her eyes, and she steals away like some frightened\ncreature. With all that she has done to redeem her character, she\nshould not be so timid of observation.\"\n\n\"You may well say 'with all that she has done!' We of her own\nhousehold hear little or nothing of what she does. If she wants help,\nshe simply tells us how and why; but if not--perhaps because it is\nsome relief to her to forget for a time the scenes of suffering in\nwhich she has been acting the part of comforter, and perhaps because\nthere always was a shy, sweet reticence about her--we never should\nknow what she is and what she does, except from the poor people\nthemselves, who would bless her in words if the very thought of her\ndid not choke them with tears. Yet, I do assure you, she passes out\nof all this gloom, and makes sunlight in our house. We are never so\ncheerful as when she is at home. She always had the art of diffusing\npeace, but now it is positive cheerfulness. And about Leonard; I\ndoubt if the wisest and most thoughtful schoolmaster could teach half\nas much directly, as his mother does unconsciously and indirectly\nevery hour that he is with her. Her noble, humble, pious endurance of\nthe consequences of what was wrong in her early life, seems expressly\nfitted to act upon him, whose position is (unjustly, for he has done\nno harm) so similar to hers.\"\n\n\"Well! I suppose we must leave it alone for the present. You will\nthink me a hard practical man when I own to you, that all I expect\nfrom Leonard's remaining a home-bird is that, with such a mother, it\nwill do him no harm. At any rate, remember my offer is the same for a\nyear--two years hence, as now. What does she look forward to making\nhim into, finally?\"\n\n\"I don't know. The wonder comes into my mind sometimes; but never\ninto hers, I think. It is part of her character--part perhaps of that\nwhich made her what she was--that she never looks forward, and seldom\nback. The present is enough for her.\"\n\nAnd so the conversation ended. When Mr Benson repeated the substance\nof it to his sister, she mused awhile, breaking out into an\noccasional whistle (although she had cured herself of this habit in a\ngreat measure), and at last she said:\n\n\"Now, do you know, I never liked poor Dick; and yet I'm angry with\nMr Farquhar for getting him out of the partnership in such a summary\nway. I can't get over it, even though he has offered to send Leonard\nto school. And here he's reigning lord-paramount at the office! As if\nyou, Thurstan, weren't as well able to teach him as any schoolmaster\nin England! But I should not mind that affront, if I were not sorry\nto think of Dick (though I never could abide him) labouring away\nin Glasgow for a petty salary of nobody knows how little, while Mr\nFarquhar is taking halves, instead of thirds, of the profits here!\"\n\nBut her brother could not tell her--and even Jemima did not know,\ntill long afterwards--that the portion of income which would have\nbeen Dick's as a junior partner, if he had remained in the business,\nwas carefully laid aside for him by Mr Farquhar; to be delivered up,\nwith all its accumulated interest, when the prodigal should have\nproved his penitence by his conduct.\n\nWhen Ruth had no call upon her time, it was indeed a holiday at\nChapel-house. She threw off as much as she could of the care and\nthe sadness in which she had been sharing; and returned fresh and\nhelpful, ready to go about in her soft, quiet way, and fill up every\nmeasure of service, and heap it with the fragrance of her own sweet\nnature. The delicate mending, that the elder women could no longer\nsee to do, was put by for Ruth's swift and nimble fingers. The\noccasional copying, or patient writing to dictation, that gave rest\nto Mr Benson's weary spine, was done by her with sunny alacrity. But,\nmost of all, Leonard's heart rejoiced when his mother came home.\nThen came the quiet confidences, the tender exchange of love, the\nhappy walks from which he returned stronger and stronger--going from\nstrength to strength as his mother led the way. It was well, as they\nsaw now, that the great shock of the disclosure had taken place when\nit did. She, for her part, wondered at her own cowardliness in having\neven striven to keep back the truth from her child--the truth that\nwas so certain to be made clear, sooner or later, and which it was\nonly owing to God's mercy that she was alive to encounter with him,\nand, by so encountering, shield and give him good courage. Moreover,\nin her secret heart, she was thankful that all occurred while he\nwas yet too young to have much curiosity as to his father. If an\nunsatisfied feeling of this kind occasionally stole into his mind,\nat any rate she never heard any expression of it; for the past was\na sealed book between them. And so, in the bright strength of good\nendeavour, the days went on, and grew again to months and years.\n\nPerhaps one little circumstance which occurred during this time had\nscarcely external importance enough to be called an event; but in\nMr Benson's mind it took rank as such. One day, about a year after\nRichard Bradshaw had ceased to be a partner in his father's house, Mr\nBenson encountered Mr Farquhar in the street, and heard from him of\nthe creditable and respectable manner in which Richard was conducting\nhimself in Glasgow, where Mr Farquhar had lately been on business.\n\n\"I am determined to tell his father of this,\" said he; \"I think his\nfamily are far too obedient to his tacit prohibition of all mention\nof Richard's name.\"\n\n\"Tacit prohibition?\" inquired Mr Benson.\n\n\"Oh! I dare say I use the words in a wrong sense for the correctness\nof a scholar; but what I mean is, that he made a point of immediately\nleaving the room if Richard's name was mentioned; and did it in so\nmarked a manner, that by degrees they understood that it was their\nfather's desire that he should never be alluded to; which was all\nvery well as long as there was nothing pleasant to be said about him;\nbut to-night I am going there, and shall take good care he does not\nescape me before I have told him all I have heard and observed about\nRichard. He will never be a hero of virtue, for his education has\ndrained him of all moral courage; but with care, and the absence of\nall strong temptation for a time, he will do very well; nothing to\ngratify paternal pride, but certainly nothing to be ashamed of.\"\n\nIt was on the Sunday after this that the little circumstance to which\nI have alluded took place.\n\nDuring the afternoon service, Mr Benson became aware that the large\nBradshaw pew was no longer unoccupied. In a dark corner Mr Bradshaw's\nwhite head was to be seen, bowed down low in prayer. When last he had\nworshipped there, the hair on that head was iron-grey, and even in\nprayer he had stood erect, with an air of conscious righteousness\nsufficient for all his wants, and even some to spare with which to\njudge others. Now, that white and hoary head was never uplifted;\npart of his unobtrusiveness might, it is true, be attributed to the\nuncomfortable feeling which was sure to attend any open withdrawal of\nthe declaration he had once made, never to enter the chapel in which\nMr Benson was minister again; and as such a feeling was natural to\nall men, and especially to such a one as Mr Bradshaw, Mr Benson\ninstinctively respected it, and passed out of the chapel with his\nhousehold, without ever directing his regards to the obscure place\nwhere Mr Bradshaw still remained immovable.\n\nFrom this day Mr Benson felt sure that the old friendly feeling\nexisted once more between them, although some time might elapse\nbefore any circumstance gave the signal for a renewal of their\nintercourse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nA Mother to Be Proud Of\n\n\nOld people tell of certain years when typhus fever swept over the\ncountry like a pestilence; years that bring back the remembrance of\ndeep sorrow--refusing to be comforted--to many a household; and which\nthose whose beloved passed through the fiery time unscathed, shrink\nfrom recalling: for great and tremulous was the anxiety--miserable\nthe constant watching for evil symptoms; and beyond the threshold\nof home a dense cloud of depression hung over society at large.\nIt seemed as if the alarm was proportionate to the previous\nlight-heartedness of fancied security--and indeed it was so; for,\nsince the days of King Belshazzar, the solemn decrees of Doom have\never seemed most terrible when they awe into silence the merry\nrevellers of life. So it was this year to which I come in the\nprogress of my story.\n\nThe summer had been unusually gorgeous. Some had complained of the\nsteaming heat, but others had pointed to the lush vegetation, which\nwas profuse and luxuriant. The early autumn was wet and cold, but\npeople did not regard it, in contemplation of some proud rejoicing\nof the nation, which filled every newspaper and gave food to every\ntongue. In Eccleston these rejoicings were greater than in most\nplaces; for, by the national triumph of arms, it was supposed that a\nnew market for the staple manufacture of the place would be opened;\nand so the trade, which had for a year or two been languishing, would\nnow revive with redoubled vigour. Besides these legitimate causes\nof good spirits, there was the rank excitement of a coming election,\nin consequence of Mr Donne having accepted a Government office,\nprocured for him by one of his influential relations. This time,\nthe Cranworths roused themselves from their magnificent torpor of\nsecurity in good season, and were going through a series of pompous\nand ponderous hospitalities, in order to bring back the Eccleston\nvoters to their allegiance.\n\nWhile the town was full of these subjects by turns--now thinking and\nspeaking of the great revival of trade--now of the chances of the\nelection, as yet some weeks distant--now of the balls at Cranworth\nCourt, in which Mr Cranworth had danced with all the belles of the\nshopocracy of Eccleston--there came creeping, creeping, in hidden,\nslimy courses, the terrible fever--that fever which is never utterly\nbanished from the sad haunts of vice and misery, but lives in such\ndarkness, like a wild beast in the recesses of his den. It had begun\nin the low Irish lodging-houses; but there it was so common it\nexcited little attention. The poor creatures died almost without the\nattendance of the unwarned medical men, who received their first\nnotice of the spreading plague from the Roman Catholic priests.\n\nBefore the medical men of Eccleston had had time to meet together\nand consult, and compare the knowledge of the fever which they had\nseverally gained, it had, like the blaze of a fire which had long\nsmouldered, burst forth in many places at once--not merely among the\nloose-living and vicious, but among the decently poor--nay, even\namong the well-to-do and respectable. And to add to the horror, like\nall similar pestilences, its course was most rapid at first, and was\nfatal in the great majority of cases--hopeless from the beginning.\nThere was a cry, and then a deep silence, and then rose the long wail\nof the survivors.\n\nA portion of the Infirmary of the town was added to that already\nset apart for a fever-ward; the smitten were carried thither at\nonce, whenever it was possible, in order to prevent the spread of\ninfection; and on that lazar-house was concentrated all the medical\nskill and force of the place.\n\nBut when one of the physicians had died, in consequence of his\nattendance--when the customary staff of matrons and nurses had been\nswept off in two days--and the nurses belonging to the Infirmary had\nshrunk from being drafted into the pestilential fever-ward--when\nhigh wages had failed to tempt any to what, in their panic, they\nconsidered as certain death--when the doctors stood aghast at the\nswift mortality among the untended sufferers, who were dependent only\non the care of the most ignorant hirelings, too brutal to recognise\nthe solemnity of Death (all this had happened within a week from the\nfirst acknowledgment of the presence of the plague)--Ruth came one\nday, with a quieter step than usual, into Mr Benson's study, and told\nhim she wanted to speak to him for a few minutes.\n\n\"To be sure, my dear! Sit down,\" said he; for she was standing and\nleaning her head against the chimney-piece, idly gazing into the\nfire. She went on standing there, as if she had not heard his words;\nand it was a few moments before she began to speak. Then she said:\n\n\"I want to tell you, that I have been this morning and offered myself\nas matron to the fever-ward while it is so full. They have accepted\nme; and I am going this evening.\"\n\n\"Oh, Ruth! I feared this; I saw your look this morning as we spoke of\nthis terrible illness.\"\n\n\"Why do you say 'fear,' Mr Benson? You yourself have been with John\nHarrison, and old Betty, and many others, I dare say, of whom we have\nnot heard.\"\n\n\"But this is so different! in such poisoned air! among such malignant\ncases! Have you thought and weighed it enough, Ruth?\"\n\nShe was quite still for a moment, but her eyes grew full of tears. At\nlast she said, very softly, with a kind of still solemnity:\n\n\"Yes! I have thought, and I have weighed. But through the very midst\nof all my fears and thoughts I have felt that I must go.\"\n\nThe remembrance of Leonard was present in both their minds; but for a\nfew moments longer they neither of them spoke. Then Ruth said:\n\n\"I believe I have no fear. That is a great preservative, they say. At\nany rate, if I have a little natural shrinking, it is quite gone when\nI remember that I am in God's hands! Oh, Mr Benson,\" continued she,\nbreaking out into the irrepressible tears--\"Leonard, Leonard!\"\n\nAnd now it was his turn to speak out the brave words of faith.\n\n\"Poor, poor mother!\" said he. \"Be of good heart. He, too, is in God's\nhands. Think what a flash of time only will separate you from him, if\nyou should die in this work!\"\n\n\"But he--but he--it will be long to him, Mr Benson! He will be\nalone!\"\n\n\"No, Ruth, he will not. God and all good men will watch over him. But\nif you cannot still this agony of fear as to what will become of him,\nyou ought not to go. Such tremulous passion will predispose you to\ntake the fever.\"\n\n\"I will not be afraid,\" she replied, lifting up her face, over which\na bright light shone, as of God's radiance. \"I am not afraid for\nmyself. I will not be so for my darling.\"\n\nAfter a little pause, they began to arrange the manner of her going,\nand to speak of the length of time that she might be absent on her\ntemporary duties. In talking of her return, they assumed it to be\ncertain, although the exact time when was to them unknown, and would\nbe dependent entirely on the duration of the fever; but not the less,\nin their secret hearts, did they feel where alone the issue lay. Ruth\nwas to communicate with Leonard and Miss Faith through Mr Benson\nalone, who insisted on his determination to go every evening to the\nHospital to learn the proceedings of the day, and the state of Ruth's\nhealth.\n\n\"It is not alone on your account, my dear! There may be many sick\npeople of whom, if I can give no other comfort, I can take\nintelligence to their friends.\"\n\nAll was settled with grave composure; yet still Ruth lingered, as if\nnerving herself up for some effort. At length she said, with a faint\nsmile upon her pale face:\n\n\"I believe I am a great coward. I stand here talking because I dread\nto tell Leonard.\"\n\n\"You must not think of it,\" exclaimed he. \"Leave it to me. It is sure\nto unnerve you.\"\n\n\"I must think of it. I shall have self-control enough in a minute\nto do it calmly--to speak hopefully. For only think,\" continued she,\nsmiling through the tears that would gather in her eyes, \"what a\ncomfort the remembrance of the last few words may be to the poor\nfellow, if--\" The words were choked, but she smiled bravely on.\n\"No!\" said she, \"that must be done; but perhaps you will spare me\none thing--will you tell Aunt Faith? I suppose I am very weak, but,\nknowing that I must go, and not knowing what may be the end, I feel\nas if I could not bear to resist her entreaties just at last. Will\nyou tell her, sir, while I go to Leonard?\"\n\nSilently he consented, and the two rose up and came forth, calm and\nserene. And calmly and gently did Ruth tell her boy of her purpose;\nnot daring even to use any unaccustomed tenderness of voice or\ngesture, lest, by so doing, she should alarm him unnecessarily as to\nthe result. She spoke hopefully, and bade him be of good courage; and\nhe caught her bravery, though his, poor boy, had root rather in his\nignorance of the actual imminent danger than in her deep faith.\n\nWhen he had gone down, Ruth began to arrange her dress. When she\ncame downstairs she went into the old familiar garden and gathered\na nosegay of the last lingering autumn flowers--a few roses and the\nlike.\n\nMr Benson had tutored his sister well; and although Miss Faith's\nface was swollen with crying, she spoke with almost exaggerated\ncheerfulness to Ruth. Indeed, as they all stood at the front door,\nmaking-believe to have careless nothings to say, just as at an\nordinary leave-taking, you would not have guessed the strained chords\nof feeling there were in each heart. They lingered on, the last rays\nof the setting sun falling on the group. Ruth once or twice had\nroused herself to the pitch of saying \"Good-bye,\" but when her eye\nfell on Leonard she was forced to hide the quivering of her lips, and\nconceal her trembling mouth amid the bunch of roses.\n\n\"They won't let you have your flowers, I'm afraid,\" said Miss Benson.\n\"Doctors so often object to the smell.\"\n\n\"No; perhaps not,\" said Ruth, hurriedly. \"I did not think of it. I\nwill only keep this one rose. Here, Leonard, darling!\" She gave the\nrest to him. It was her farewell; for having now no veil to hide her\nemotion, she summoned all her bravery for one parting smile, and,\nsmiling, turned away. But she gave one look back from the street,\njust from the last point at which the door could be seen, and\ncatching a glimpse of Leonard standing foremost on the step, she ran\nback, and he met her half-way, and mother and child spoke never a\nword in that close embrace.\n\n\"Now, Leonard,\" said Miss Faith, \"be a brave boy. I feel sure she\nwill come back to us before very long.\"\n\nBut she was very near crying herself; and she would have given way, I\nbelieve, if she had not found the wholesome outlet of scolding Sally,\nfor expressing just the same opinion respecting Ruth's proceedings as\nshe herself had done not two hours before. Taking what her brother\nhad said to her as a text, she delivered such a lecture to Sally\non want of faith that she was astonished at herself, and so much\naffected by what she had said that she had to shut the door of\ncommunication between the kitchen and the parlour pretty hastily, in\norder to prevent Sally's threatened reply from weakening her belief\nin the righteousness of what Ruth had done. Her words had gone beyond\nher conviction.\n\nEvening after evening Mr Benson went forth to gain news of Ruth;\nand night after night he returned with good tidings. The fever, it\nis true, raged; but no plague came nigh her. He said her face was\never calm and bright, except when clouded by sorrow as she gave the\naccounts of the deaths which occurred in spite of every care. He said\nhe had never seen her face so fair and gentle as it was now, when she\nwas living in the midst of disease and woe.\n\nOne evening Leonard (for they had grown bolder as to the infection)\naccompanied him to the street on which the hospital abutted. Mr\nBenson left him there, and told him to return home; but the boy\nlingered, attracted by the crowd that had gathered, and were gazing\nup intently towards the lighted windows of the hospital. There was\nnothing beyond to be seen; but the greater part of these poor people\nhad friends or relations in that palace of Death.\n\nLeonard stood and listened. At first their talk consisted of vague\nand exaggerated accounts (if such could be exaggerated) of the\nhorrors of the fever. Then they spoke of Ruth--of his mother; and\nLeonard held his breath to hear.\n\n\"They say she has been a great sinner, and that this is her penance,\"\nquoth one. And as Leonard gasped, before rushing forward to give the\nspeaker straight the lie, an old man spoke:\n\n\"Such a one as her has never been a great sinner; nor does she do her\nwork as a penance, but for the love of God, and of the blessed Jesus.\nShe will be in the light of God's countenance when you and I will be\nstanding afar off. I tell you, man, when my poor wench died, as no\none would come near, her head lay at that hour on this woman's sweet\nbreast. I could fell you,\" the old man went on, lifting his shaking\narm, \"for calling that woman a great sinner. The blessing of them who\nwere ready to perish is upon her.\"\n\nImmediately there arose a clamour of tongues, each with some tale of\nhis mother's gentle doings, till Leonard grew dizzy with the beatings\nof his glad, proud heart. Few were aware how much Ruth had done;\nshe never spoke of it, shrinking with sweet shyness from over-much\nallusion to her own work at all times. Her left hand truly knew not\nwhat her right hand did; and Leonard was overwhelmed now to hear\nof the love and the reverence with which the poor and outcast had\nsurrounded her. It was irrepressible. He stepped forward with a proud\nbearing, and touching the old man's arm who had first spoken, Leonard\ntried to speak; but for an instant he could not, his heart was too\nfull: tears came before words, but at length he managed to say:\n\n\"Sir, I am her son!\"\n\n\"Thou! thou her bairn! God bless you, lad,\" said an old woman,\npushing through the crowd. \"It was but last night she kept my child\nquiet with singing psalms the night through. Low and sweet, low and\nsweet, they tell me--till many poor things were hushed, though they\nwere out of their minds, and had not heard psalms this many a year.\nGod in heaven bless you, lad!\"\n\nMany other wild, woe-begone creatures pressed forward with blessings\non Ruth's son, while he could only repeat:\n\n\"She is my mother.\"\n\nFrom that day forward Leonard walked erect in the streets of\nEccleston, where \"many arose and called her blessed.\"\n\nAfter some weeks the virulence of the fever abated; and the general\npanic subsided--indeed, a kind of fool-hardiness succeeded. To\nbe sure, in some instances the panic still held possession of\nindividuals to an exaggerated extent. But the number of patients in\nthe hospital was rapidly diminishing, and, for money, those were to\nbe found who could supply Ruth's place. But to her it was owing that\nthe overwrought fear of the town was subdued; it was she who had gone\nvoluntarily, and, with no thought of greed or gain, right into the\nvery jaws of the fierce disease. She bade the inmates of the hospital\nfarewell, and after carefully submitting herself to the purification\nrecommended by Mr Davis, the principal surgeon of the place, who had\nalways attended Leonard, she returned to Mr Benson's just at gloaming\ntime.\n\nThey each vied with the other in the tenderest cares. They hastened\ntea; they wheeled the sofa to the fire; they made her lie down; and\nto all she submitted with the docility of a child; and when the\ncandles came, even Mr Benson's anxious eye could see no change in her\nlooks, but that she seemed a little paler. The eyes were as full of\nspiritual light, the gently parted lips as rosy, and the smile, if\nmore rare, yet as sweet as ever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\"I Must Go and Nurse Mr Bellingham\"\n\n\nThe next morning, Miss Benson would insist upon making Ruth lie down\non the sofa. Ruth longed to do many things; to be much more active;\nbut she submitted, when she found that it would gratify Miss Faith if\nshe remained as quiet as if she were really an invalid.\n\nLeonard sat by her holding her hand. Every now and then he looked up\nfrom his book, as if to make sure that she indeed was restored to\nhim. He had brought her down the flowers which she had given him the\nday of her departure, and which he had kept in water as long as they\nhad any greenness or fragrance, and then had carefully dried and put\nby. She too, smiling, had produced the one rose which she had carried\naway to the hospital. Never had the bond between her and her boy been\ndrawn so firm and strong.\n\nMany visitors came this day to the quiet Chapel-house. First of all\nMrs Farquhar appeared. She looked very different from the Jemima\nBradshaw of three years ago. Happiness had called out beauty; the\ncolouring of her face was lovely, and vivid as that of an autumn\nday; her berry-red lips scarce closed over the short white teeth for\nher smiles; and her large dark eyes glowed and sparkled with daily\nhappiness. They were softened by a mist of tears as she looked upon\nRuth.\n\n\"Lie still! Don't move! You must be content to-day to be waited upon,\nand nursed! I have just seen Miss Benson in the lobby, and had charge\nupon charge not to fatigue you. Oh, Ruth! how we all love you, now we\nhave you back again! Do you know, I taught Rosa to say her prayers as\nsoon as ever you were gone to that horrid place, just on purpose that\nher little innocent lips might pray for you--I wish you could hear\nher say it--'Please, dear God, keep Ruth safe.' Oh, Leonard! are not\nyou proud of your mother?\"\n\nLeonard said \"Yes,\" rather shortly, as if he were annoyed that any\none else should know, or even have a right to imagine, how proud he\nwas. Jemima went on:\n\n\"Now, Ruth! I have got a plan for you. Walter and I have partly made\nit; and partly it's papa's doing. Yes, dear! papa has been quite\nanxious to show his respect for you. We all want you to go to the\ndear Eagle's Crag for this next month, and get strong, and have some\nchange in that fine air at Abermouth. I am going to take little\nRosa there. Papa has lent it to us. And the weather is often very\nbeautiful in November.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much. It is very tempting; for I have been almost\nlonging for some such change. I cannot tell all at once whether I\ncan go; but I will see about it, if you will let me leave it open a\nlittle.\"\n\n\"Oh! as long as you like, so that you will but go at last. And,\nMaster Leonard! you are to come too. Now, I know I have you on my\nside.\"\n\nRuth thought of the place. Her only reluctance arose from the\nremembrance of that one interview on the sands. That walk she could\nnever go again; but how much remained! How much that would be a\ncharming balm and refreshment to her!\n\n\"What happy evenings we shall have together! Do you know, I think\nMary and Elizabeth may perhaps come.\"\n\nA bright gleam of sunshine came into the room. \"Look! how bright and\npropitious for our plans. Dear Ruth, it seems like an omen for the\nfuture!\"\n\nAlmost while she spoke, Miss Benson entered, bringing with her Mr\nGrey, the rector of Eccleston. He was an elderly man, short and\nstoutly-built, with something very formal in his manner; but any one\nmight feel sure of his steady benevolence who noticed the expression\nof his face, and especially of the kindly black eyes that gleamed\nbeneath his grey and shaggy eyebrows. Ruth had seen him at the\nhospital once or twice, and Mrs Farquhar had met him pretty\nfrequently in general society.\n\n\"Go and tell your uncle,\" said Miss Benson to Leonard.\n\n\"Stop, my boy! I have just met Mr Benson in the street, and my errand\nnow is to your mother. I should like you to remain and hear what it\nis; and I am sure that my business will give these ladies\"--bowing to\nMiss Benson and Jemima--\"so much pleasure, that I need not apologise\nfor entering upon it in their presence.\"\n\nHe pulled out his double eye-glass, saying, with a grave smile:\n\n\"You ran away from us yesterday so quietly and cunningly, Mrs\nDenbigh, that you were, perhaps, not aware that the Board was sitting\nat that very time, and trying to form a vote sufficiently expressive\nof our gratitude to you. As Chairman, they requested me to present\nyou with this letter, which I shall have the pleasure of reading.\"\n\nWith all due emphasis he read aloud a formal letter from the\nSecretary to the Infirmary, conveying a vote of thanks to Ruth.\n\nThe good rector did not spare her one word, from date to signature;\nand then, folding the letter up, he gave it to Leonard, saying:\n\n\"There, sir! when you are an old man, you may read that testimony to\nyour mother's noble conduct with pride and pleasure. For, indeed,\"\ncontinued he, turning to Jemima, \"no words can express the relief\nit was to us. I speak of the gentlemen composing the Board of the\nInfirmary. When Mrs Denbigh came forward, the panic was at its\nheight, and the alarm of course aggravated the disorder. The poor\ncreatures died rapidly; there was hardly time to remove the dead\nbodies before others were brought in to occupy the beds, so little\nhelp was to be procured on account of the universal terror; and the\nmorning when Mrs Denbigh offered us her services, we seemed at the\nvery worst. I shall never forget the sensation of relief in my mind\nwhen she told us what she proposed to do; but we thought it right to\nwarn her to the full extent--\n\n\"Nay, madam,\" said he, catching a glimpse of Ruth's changing colour,\n\"I will spare you any more praises. I will only say, if I can be a\nfriend to you, or a friend to your child, you may command my poor\npowers to the utmost.\"\n\nHe got up, and bowing formally, he took his leave. Jemima came and\nkissed Ruth. Leonard went upstairs to put the precious letter away.\nMiss Benson sat crying heartily in a corner of the room. Ruth went to\nher and threw her arms round her neck, and said:\n\n\"I could not tell him just then. I durst not speak for fear of\nbreaking down; but if I have done right, it was all owing to you and\nMr Benson. Oh! I wish I had said how the thought first came into my\nhead from seeing the things Mr Benson has done so quietly ever since\nthe fever first came amongst us. I could not speak; and it seemed\nas if I was taking those praises to myself, when all the time I was\nfeeling how little I deserved them--how it was all owing to you.\"\n\n\"Under God, Ruth,\" said Miss Benson, speaking through her tears.\n\n\"Oh! I think there is nothing humbles one so much as undue praise.\nWhile he was reading that letter, I could not help feeling how many\nthings I have done wrong! Could he know of--of what I have been?\"\nasked she, dropping her voice very low.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Jemima, \"he knew--everybody in Eccleston did know--but\nthe remembrance of those days is swept away. Miss Benson,\" she\ncontinued, for she was anxious to turn the subject, \"you must be on\nmy side, and persuade Ruth to come to Abermouth for a few weeks. I\nwant her and Leonard both to come.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid my brother will think that Leonard is missing his lessons\nsadly. Just of late we could not wonder that the poor child's heart\nwas so full; but he must make haste, and get on all the more for his\nidleness.\" Miss Benson piqued herself on being a disciplinarian.\n\n\"Oh, as for lessons, Walter is so very anxious that you should give\nway to his superior wisdom, Ruth, and let Leonard go to school. He\nwill send him to any school you fix upon, according to the mode of\nlife you plan for him.\"\n\n\"I have no plan,\" said Ruth. \"I have no means of planning. All I can\ndo is to try and make him ready for anything.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Jemima, \"we must talk it over at Abermouth; for I\nam sure you won't refuse to come, dearest, dear Ruth! Think of\nthe quiet, sunny days, and the still evenings, that we shall have\ntogether, with little Rosa to tumble about among the fallen leaves;\nand there's Leonard to have his first sight of the sea.\"\n\n\"I do think of it,\" said Ruth, smiling at the happy picture Jemima\ndrew. And both smiling at the hopeful prospect before them, they\nparted--never to meet again in life.\n\nNo sooner had Mrs Farquhar gone than Sally burst in.\n\n\"Oh! dear, dear!\" said she, looking around her. \"If I had but known\nthat the rector was coming to call, I'd ha' put on the best covers,\nand the Sunday tablecloth! You're well enough,\" continued she,\nsurveying Ruth from head to foot; \"you're always trim and dainty\nin your gowns, though I reckon they cost but tuppence a yard, and\nyou've a face to set 'em off; but as for you\" (as she turned to Miss\nBenson), \"I think you might ha' had something better on than that\nold stuff, if it had only been to do credit to a parishioner like me,\nwhom he has known ever sin' my father was his clerk.\"\n\n\"You forget, Sally, I have been making jelly all the morning. How\ncould I tell it was Mr Grey when there was a knock at the door?\" Miss\nBenson replied.\n\n\"You might ha' letten me do the jelly; I'se warrant I could ha'\npleased Ruth as well as you. If I had but known he was coming,\nI'd ha' slipped round the corner and bought ye a neck-ribbon, or\nsummut to lighten ye up. I'se loath he should think I'm living with\nDissenters, that don't know how to keep themselves trig and smart.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Sally; he never thought of me. What he came for, was to\nsee Ruth; and, as you say, she's always neat and dainty.\"\n\n\"Well! I reckon it cannot be helped now; but if I buy ye a ribbon,\nwill you promise to wear it when church-folks come? for I cannot\nabide the way they have of scoffing at the Dissenters about their\ndress.\"\n\n\"Very well! we'll make that bargain,\" said Miss Benson; \"and now,\nRuth, I'll go and fetch you a cup of warm jelly.\"\n\n\"Oh! indeed, Aunt Faith,\" said Ruth, \"I am very sorry to balk you;\nbut if you're going to treat me as an invalid, I am afraid I shall\nrebel.\"\n\nBut when she found that Aunt Faith's heart was set upon it, she\nsubmitted very graciously, only dimpling up a little, as she found\nthat she must consent to lie on the sofa, and be fed, when, in truth,\nshe felt full of health, with a luxurious sensation of languor\nstealing over her now and then, just enough to make it very pleasant\nto think of the salt breezes, and the sea beauty which awaited her at\nAbermouth.\n\nMr Davis called in the afternoon, and his visit was also to Ruth. Mr\nand Miss Benson were sitting with her in the parlour, and watching\nher with contented love, as she employed herself in household sewing,\nand hopefully spoke about the Abermouth plan.\n\n\"Well! so you had our worthy rector here to-day; I am come on\nsomething of the same kind of errand; only I shall spare you the\nreading of my letter, which, I'll answer for it, he did not. Please\nto take notice,\" said he, putting down a sealed letter, \"that I have\ndelivered you a vote of thanks from my medical brothers; and open\nand read it at your leisure; only not just now, for I want to have\na little talk with you on my own behoof. I want to ask you a favour,\nMrs Denbigh.\"\n\n\"A favour!\" exclaimed Ruth; \"what can I do for you? I think I may say\nI will do it, without hearing what it is.\"\n\n\"Then you're a very imprudent woman,\" replied he; \"however, I'll take\nyou at your word. I want you to give me your boy.\"\n\n\"Leonard!\"\n\n\"Aye! there it is, you see, Mr Benson. One minute she is as ready as\ncan be, and the next, she looks at me as if I was an ogre!\"\n\n\"Perhaps we don't understand what you mean,\" said Mr Benson.\n\n\"The thing is this. You know I've no children; and I can't say I've\never fretted over it much; but my wife has; and whether it is that\nshe has infected me, or that I grieve over my good practice going\nto a stranger, when I ought to have had a son to take it after me, I\ndon't know; but, of late, I've got to look with covetous eyes on all\nhealthy boys, and at last I've settled down my wishes on this Leonard\nof yours, Mrs Denbigh.\"\n\nRuth could not speak; for, even yet, she did not understand what he\nmeant. He went on:\n\n\"Now, how old is the lad?\" He asked Ruth, but Miss Benson replied:\n\n\"He'll be twelve next February.\"\n\n\"Umph! only twelve! He's tall and old-looking for his age. You look\nyoung enough, it is true.\" He said this last sentence as if to\nhimself, but seeing Ruth crimson up, he abruptly changed his tone.\n\n\"Twelve, is he! Well, I take him from now. I don't mean that I really\ntake him away from you,\" said he, softening all at once, and becoming\ngrave and considerate. \"His being your son--the son of one whom I\nhave seen--as I have seen you, Mrs Denbigh (out and out the best\nnurse I ever met with, Miss Benson; and good nurses are things\nwe doctors know how to value)--his being your son is his great\nrecommendation to me; not but what the lad himself is a noble boy.\nI shall be glad to leave him with you as long and as much as we can;\nhe could not be tied to your apron-strings all his life, you know.\nOnly I provide for his education, subject to your consent and good\npleasure, and he is bound apprentice to me. I, his guardian, bind him\nto myself, the first surgeon in Eccleston, be the other who he may;\nand in process of time he becomes partner, and some day or other\nsucceeds me. Now, Mrs Denbigh, what have you got to say against this\nplan? My wife is just as full of it as me. Come! begin with your\nobjections. You're not a woman if you have not a whole bag-full of\nthem ready to turn out against any reasonable proposal.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" faltered Ruth. \"It is so sudden--\"\n\n\"It is very, very kind of you, Mr Davis,\" said Miss Benson, a little\nscandalised at Ruth's non-expression of gratitude.\n\n\"Pooh! pooh! I'll answer for it, in the long run, I am taking good\ncare of my own interests. Come, Mrs Denbigh, is it a bargain?\"\n\nNow Mr Benson spoke.\n\n\"Mr Davis, it is rather sudden, as she says. As far as I can see,\nit is the best as well as the kindest proposal that could have been\nmade; but I think we must give her a little time to think about it.\"\n\n\"Well, twenty-four hours! Will that do?\"\n\nRuth lifted up her head. \"Mr Davis, I am not ungrateful because I\ncan't thank you\" (she was crying while she spoke); \"let me have a\nfortnight to consider about it. In a fortnight I will make up my\nmind. Oh, how good you all are!\"\n\n\"Very well. Then this day fortnight--Thursday the 28th--you will let\nme know your decision. Mind! if it's against me, I shan't consider it\na decision, for I'm determined to carry my point. I'm not going to\nmake Mrs Denbigh blush, Mr Benson, by telling you, in her presence,\nof all I have observed about her this last three weeks, that has made\nme sure of the good qualities I shall find in this boy of hers. I was\nwatching her when she little thought it. Do you remember that night\nwhen Hector O'Brien was so furiously delirious, Mrs Denbigh?\"\n\nRuth went very white at the remembrance.\n\n\"Why now, look there! how pale she is at the very thought of it. And\nyet, I assure you, she was the one to go up and take the piece of\nglass from him which he had broken out of the window for the sole\npurpose of cutting his throat, or the throat of any one else, for\nthat matter. I wish we had some others as brave as she is.\"\n\n\"I thought the great panic was passed away!\" said Mr Benson.\n\n\"Aye! the general feeling of alarm is much weaker; but, here and\nthere, there are as great fools as ever. Why, when I leave here, I am\ngoing to see our precious member, Mr Donne--\"\n\n\"Mr Donne?\" said Ruth.\n\n\"Mr Donne, who lies ill at the Queen's--came last week, with the\nintention of canvassing, but was too much alarmed by what he heard of\nthe fever to set to work; and, in spite of all his precautions, he\nhas taken it; and you should see the terror they are in at the hotel;\nlandlord, landlady, waiters, servants--all; there's not a creature\nwill go near him, if they can help it; and there's only his groom--a\nlad he saved from drowning, I'm told--to do anything for him. I must\nget him a proper nurse, somehow or somewhere, for all my being a\nCranworth man. Ah, Mr Benson! you don't know the temptations we\nmedical men have. Think, if I allowed your member to die now, as he\nmight very well, if he had no nurse--how famously Mr Cranworth would\nwalk over the course!--Where's Mrs Denbigh gone to? I hope I've not\nfrightened her away by reminding her of Hector O'Brien, and that\nawful night, when I do assure you she behaved like a heroine!\"\n\nAs Mr Benson was showing Mr Davis out, Ruth opened the study-door,\nand said, in a very calm, low voice:\n\n\"Mr Benson! will you allow me to speak to Mr Davis alone?\"\n\nMr Benson immediately consented, thinking that, in all probability,\nshe wished to ask some further questions about Leonard; but as Mr\nDavis came into the room, and shut the door, he was struck by her\npale, stern face of determination, and awaited her speaking first.\n\n\"Mr Davis! I must go and nurse Mr Bellingham,\" said she at last,\nclenching her hands tight together, but no other part of her body\nmoving from its intense stillness.\n\n\"Mr Bellingham?\" asked he, astonished at the name.\n\n\"Mr Donne, I mean,\" said she, hurriedly. \"His name was Bellingham.\"\n\n\"Oh! I remember hearing he had changed his name for some property.\nBut you must not think of any more such work just now. You are not\nfit for it. You are looking as white as ashes.\"\n\n\"I must go,\" she repeated.\n\n\"Nonsense! Here's a man who can pay for the care of the first\nhospital nurses in London--and I doubt if his life is worth the risk\nof one of theirs even, much more of yours.\"\n\n\"We have no right to weigh human lives against each other.\"\n\n\"No! I know we have not. But it's a way we doctors are apt to get\ninto; and, at any rate, it's ridiculous of you to think of such a\nthing. Just listen to reason.\"\n\n\"I can't! I can't!\" cried she, with sharp pain in her voice. \"You\nmust let me go, dear Mr Davis!\" said she, now speaking with soft\nentreaty.\n\n\"No!\" said he, shaking his head authoritatively. \"I'll do no such\nthing.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said she, dropping her voice, and going all over the\ndeepest scarlet; \"he is Leonard's father! Now! you will let me go!\"\n\nMr Davis was indeed staggered by what she said, and for a moment he\ndid not speak. So she went on:\n\n\"You will not tell! You must not tell! No one knows, not even Mr\nBenson, who it was. And now--it might do him so much harm to have it\nknown. You will not tell!\"\n\n\"No! I will not tell,\" replied he. \"But, Mrs Denbigh, you must answer\nme this one question, which I ask you in all true respect, but which\nI must ask, in order to guide both myself and you aright--of course\nI knew Leonard was illegitimate--in fact, I will give you secret for\nsecret: it was being so myself that first made me sympathise with\nhim, and desire to adopt him. I knew that much of your history; but\ntell me, do you now care for this man? Answer me truly--do you love\nhim?\"\n\nFor a moment or two she did not speak; her head was bent down; then\nshe raised it up, and looked with clear and honest eyes into his\nface.\n\n\"I have been thinking--but I do not know--I cannot tell--I don't\nthink I should love him, if he were well and happy--but you said he\nwas ill--and alone--how can I help caring for him?--how can I help\ncaring for him?\" repeated she, covering her face with her hands, and\nthe quick hot tears stealing through her fingers. \"He is Leonard's\nfather,\" continued she, looking up at Mr Davis suddenly. \"He need not\nknow--he shall not--that I have ever been near him. If he is like the\nothers, he must be delirious--I will leave him before he comes to\nhimself--but now let me go--I must go.\"\n\n\"I wish my tongue had been bitten out before I had named him to\nyou. He would do well enough without you; and, I dare say, if he\nrecognises you, he will only be annoyed.\"\n\n\"It is very likely,\" said Ruth, heavily.\n\n\"Annoyed,--why! he may curse you for your unasked-for care of him.\nI have heard my poor mother--and she was as pretty and delicate a\ncreature as you are--cursed for showing tenderness when it was not\nwanted. Now, be persuaded by an old man like me, who has seen enough\nof life to make his heart ache--leave this fine gentleman to his\nfate. I'll promise you to get him as good a nurse as can be had for\nmoney.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Ruth, with dull persistency--as if she had not attended to\nhis dissuasions; \"I must go. I will leave him before he recognises\nme.\"\n\n\"Why, then,\" said the old surgeon, \"if you're so bent upon it,\nI suppose I must let you. It is but what my mother would have\ndone--poor, heart-broken thing! However, come along, and let us\nmake the best of it. It saves me a deal of trouble, I know; for, if\nI have you for a right hand, I need not worry myself continually\nwith wondering how he is taken care of. Go! get your bonnet, you\ntender-hearted fool of a woman! Let us get you out of the house\nwithout any more scenes or explanations; I'll make all straight with\nthe Bensons.\"\n\n\"You will not tell my secret, Mr Davis,\" she said, abruptly.\n\n\"No! not I! Does the woman think I had never to keep a secret of the\nkind before? I only hope he'll lose his election, and never come near\nthe place again. After all,\" continued he, sighing, \"I suppose it is\nbut human nature!\" He began recalling the circumstances of his own\nearly life, and dreamily picturing scenes in the grey dying embers of\nthe fire; and he was almost startled when she stood before him, ready\nequipped, grave, pale, and quiet.\n\n\"Come along!\" said he. \"If you're to do any good at all, it must be\nin these next three days. After that, I'll ensure his life for this\nbout; and mind! I shall send you home then; for he might know you,\nand I'll have no excitement to throw him back again, and no sobbing\nand crying from you. But now every moment your care is precious to\nhim. I shall tell my own story to the Bensons, as soon as I have\ninstalled you.\"\n\nMr Donne lay in the best room of the Queen's Hotel--no one with him\nbut his faithful, ignorant servant, who was as much afraid of the\nfever as any one else could be, but who, nevertheless, would not\nleave his master--his master who had saved his life as a child, and\nafterwards put him in the stables at Bellingham Hall, where he learnt\nall that he knew. He stood in a farther corner of the room, watching\nhis delirious master with affrighted eyes, not daring to come near\nhim, nor yet willing to leave him.\n\n\"Oh! if that doctor would but come! He'll kill himself or me--and\nthem stupid servants won't stir a step over the threshold; how shall\nI get over the night? Blessings on him--here's the old doctor back\nagain! I hear him creaking and scolding up the stairs!\"\n\nThe door opened, and Mr Davis entered, followed by Ruth.\n\n\"Here's the nurse, my good man--such a nurse as there is not in the\nthree counties. Now, all you'll have to do is to mind what she says.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir! he's mortal bad! won't you stay with us through the night,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Look there!\" whispered Mr Davis to the man, \"see how she knows how\nto manage him! Why, I could not do it better myself!\"\n\nShe had gone up to the wild, raging figure, and with soft authority\nhad made him lie down: and then, placing a basin of cold water by the\nbedside, she had dipped in it her pretty hands, and was laying their\ncool dampness on his hot brow, speaking in a low soothing voice all\nthe time, in a way that acted like a charm in hushing his mad talk.\n\n\"But I will stay,\" said the doctor, after he had examined his\npatient; \"as much on her account as his! and partly to quieten the\nfears of this poor, faithful fellow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nOut of Darkness into Light\n\n\nThe third night after this was to be the crisis--the turning-point\nbetween Life and Death. Mr Davis came again to pass it by the bedside\nof the sufferer. Ruth was there, constant and still, intent upon\nwatching the symptoms, and acting according to them, in obedience\nto Mr Davis's directions. She had never left the room. Every sense\nhad been strained in watching--every power of thought or judgment\nhad been kept on the full stretch. Now that Mr Davis came and took\nher place, and that the room was quiet for the night, she became\noppressed with heaviness, which yet did not tend to sleep. She could\nnot remember the present time, or where she was. All times of her\nearliest youth--the days of her childhood--were in her memory with a\nminuteness and fulness of detail which was miserable; for all along\nshe felt that she had no real grasp on the scenes that were passing\nthrough her mind--that, somehow, they were long gone by, and gone by\nfor ever--and yet she could not remember who she was now, nor where\nshe was, and whether she had now any interests in life to take the\nplace of those which she was conscious had passed away, although\ntheir remembrance filled her mind with painful acuteness. Her head\nlay on her arms, and they rested on the table. Every now and then she\nopened her eyes, and saw the large room, handsomely furnished with\narticles that were each one incongruous with the other, as if bought\nat sales. She saw the flickering night-light--she heard the ticking\nof the watch, and the two breathings, each going on at a separate\nrate--one hurried, abruptly stopping, and then panting violently, as\nif to make up for lost time; and the other slow, steady, and regular,\nas if the breather was asleep; but this supposition was contradicted\nby an occasional repressed sound of yawning. The sky through the\nuncurtained window looked dark and black--would this night never have\nan end? Had the sun gone down for ever, and would the world at last\nawaken to a general sense of everlasting night?\n\nThen she felt as if she ought to get up, and go and see how the\ntroubled sleeper in yonder bed was struggling through his illness;\nbut she could not remember who the sleeper was, and she shrunk\nfrom seeing some phantom-face on the pillow, such as now began to\nhaunt the dark corners of the room, and look at her, jibbering and\nmowing as they looked. So she covered her face again, and sank into\na whirling stupor of sense and feeling. By-and-by she heard her\nfellow-watcher stirring, and a dull wonder stole over her as to what\nhe was doing; but the heavy languor pressed her down, and kept her\nstill. At last she heard the words, \"Come here,\" and listlessly\nobeyed the command. She had to steady herself in the rocking chamber\nbefore she could walk to the bed by which Mr Davis stood; but\nthe effort to do so roused her, and, although conscious of an\noppressive headache, she viewed with sudden and clear vision all the\ncircumstances of her present position. Mr Davis was near the head of\nthe bed, holding the night-lamp high, and shading it with his hand,\nthat it might not disturb the sick person, who lay with his face\ntowards them, in feeble exhaustion, but with every sign that the\nviolence of the fever had left him. It so happened that the rays of\nthe lamp fell bright and full upon Ruth's countenance, as she stood\nwith her crimson lips parted with the hurrying breath, and the\nfever-flush brilliant on her cheeks. Her eyes were wide open, and\ntheir pupils distended. She looked on the invalid in silence, and\nhardly understood why Mr Davis had summoned her there.\n\n\"Don't you see the change? He is better!--the crisis is past!\"\n\nBut she did not speak; her looks were riveted on his softly-unclosing\neyes, which met hers as they opened languidly. She could not stir\nor speak. She was held fast by that gaze of his, in which a faint\nrecognition dawned, and grew to strength.\n\nHe murmured some words. They strained their sense to hear. He\nrepeated them even lower than before; but this time they caught what\nhe was saying.\n\n\"Where are the water-lilies? Where are the lilies in her hair?\"\n\nMr Davis drew Ruth away.\n\n\"He is still rambling,\" said he, \"but the fever has left him.\"\n\nThe grey dawn was now filling the room with its cold light; was it\nthat made Ruth's cheek so deadly pale? Could that call out the wild\nentreaty of her look, as if imploring help against some cruel foe\nthat held her fast, and was wrestling with her Spirit of Life? She\nheld Mr Davis's arm. If she had let it go, she would have fallen.\n\n\"Take me home,\" she said, and fainted dead away.\n\nMr Davis carried her out of the chamber, and sent the groom to keep\nwatch by his master. He ordered a fly to convey her to Mr Benson's,\nand lifted her in when it came, for she was still half unconscious.\nIt was he who carried her upstairs to her room, where Miss Benson and\nSally undressed and laid her in her bed.\n\nHe awaited their proceedings in Mr Benson's study. When Mr Benson\ncame in, Mr Davis said:\n\n\"Don't blame me. Don't add to my self-reproach. I have killed her. I\nwas a cruel fool to let her go. Don't speak to me.\"\n\n\"It may not be so bad,\" said Mr Benson, himself needing comfort in\nthat shock. \"She may recover. She surely will recover. I believe she\nwill.\"\n\n\"No, no! she won't. But by ---- she shall, if I can save her.\" Mr\nDavis looked defiantly at Mr Benson, as if he were Fate. \"I tell you\nshe shall recover, or else I am a murderer. What business had I to\ntake her to nurse him--\"\n\nHe was cut short by Sally's entrance and announcement that Ruth was\nnow prepared to see him.\n\nFrom that time forward Mr Davis devoted all his leisure, his skill,\nhis energy, to save her. He called on the rival surgeon to beg him\nto undertake the management of Mr Donne's recovery, saying, with his\nusual self-mockery, \"I could not answer it to Mr Cranworth if I had\nbrought his opponent round, you know, when I had had such a fine\nopportunity in my power. Now, with your patients, and general Radical\ninterest, it will be rather a feather in your cap; for he may want a\ngood deal of care yet, though he is getting on famously--so rapidly,\nin fact, that it's a strong temptation to me to throw him back--a\nrelapse, you know.\"\n\nThe other surgeon bowed gravely, apparently taking Mr Davis in\nearnest, but certainly very glad of the job thus opportunely thrown\nin his way. In spite of Mr Davis's real and deep anxiety about Ruth,\nhe could not help chuckling over his rival's literal interpretation\nof all he had said.\n\n\"To be sure, what fools men are! I don't know why one should watch\nand strive to keep them in the world. I have given this fellow\nsomething to talk about confidentially to all his patients; I wonder\nhow much stronger a dose the man would have swallowed! I must\nbegin to take care of my practice for that lad yonder. Well-a-day!\nwell-a-day! What was this sick fine gentleman sent here for, that she\nshould run a chance of her life for him? or why was he sent into the\nworld at all, for that matter?\"\n\nIndeed, however much Mr Davis might labour with all his professional\nskill--however much they might all watch--and pray--and weep--it was\nbut too evident that Ruth \"home must go, and take her wages.\" Poor,\npoor Ruth!\n\nIt might be that, utterly exhausted by watching and nursing, first\nin the hospital, and then by the bedside of her former lover, the\npower of her constitution was worn out; or, it might be, her gentle,\npliant sweetness, but she displayed no outrage or discord even in her\ndelirium. There she lay in the attic-room in which her baby had been\nborn, her watch over him kept, her confession to him made; and now\nshe was stretched on the bed in utter helplessness, softly gazing at\nvacancy with her open, unconscious eyes, from which all the depth of\ntheir meaning had fled, and all they told was of a sweet, child-like\ninsanity within. The watchers could not touch her with their\nsympathy, or come near her in her dim world;--so, mutely, but looking\nat each other from time to time with tearful eyes, they took a poor\ncomfort from the one evident fact that, though lost and gone astray,\nshe was happy and at peace. They had never heard her sing; indeed,\nthe simple art which her mother had taught her, had died, with her\nearly joyousness, at that dear mother's death. But now she sang\ncontinually, very soft and low. She went from one childish ditty to\nanother without let or pause, keeping a strange sort of time with\nher pretty fingers, as they closed and unclosed themselves upon the\ncounterpane. She never looked at any one with the slightest glimpse\nof memory or intelligence in her face; no, not even at Leonard.\n\nHer strength faded day by day; but she knew it not. Her sweet lips\nwere parted to sing, even after the breath and the power to do so had\nleft her, and her fingers fell idly on the bed. Two days she lingered\nthus--all but gone from them, and yet still there.\n\nThey stood around her bedside, not speaking, or sighing, or moaning;\nthey were too much awed by the exquisite peacefulness of her look\nfor that. Suddenly she opened wide her eyes, and gazed intently\nforwards, as if she saw some happy vision, which called out a lovely,\nrapturous, breathless smile. They held their very breaths.\n\n\"I see the Light coming,\" said she. \"The Light is coming,\" she said.\nAnd, raising herself slowly, she stretched out her arms, and then\nfell back, very still for evermore.\n\nThey did not speak. Mr Davis was the first to utter a word.\n\n\"It is over!\" said he. \"She is dead!\"\n\nOut rang through the room the cry of Leonard:\n\n\"Mother! mother! mother! You have not left me alone! You will not\nleave me alone! You are not dead! Mother! Mother!\"\n\nThey had pent in his agony of apprehension till then, that no wail of\nher child might disturb her ineffable calm. But now there was a cry\nheard through the house, of one refusing to be comforted: \"Mother!\nMother!\"\n\nBut Ruth lay dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nThe End\n\n\nA stupor of grief succeeded to Leonard's passionate cries. He became\nso much depressed, physically as well as mentally, before the end of\nthe day, that Mr Davis was seriously alarmed for the consequences. He\nhailed with gladness a proposal made by the Farquhars, that the boy\nshould be removed to their house, and placed under the fond care of\nhis mother's friend, who sent her own child to Abermouth the better\nto devote herself to Leonard.\n\nWhen they told him of this arrangement, he at first refused to go and\nleave _her_; but when Mr Benson said:\n\n\"_She_ would have wished it, Leonard! Do it for her sake!\" he went\naway very quietly; not speaking a word, after Mr Benson had made the\nvoluntary promise that he should see her once again. He neither spoke\nnor cried for many hours; and all Jemima's delicate wiles were called\nforth, before his heavy heart could find the relief of tears. And\nthen he was so weak, and his pulse so low, that all who loved him\nfeared for his life.\n\nAnxiety about him made a sad distraction from the sorrow for the\ndead. The three old people, who now formed the household in the\nChapel-house, went about slowly and dreamily, each with a dull wonder\nat their hearts why they, the infirm and worn-out, were left, while\nshe was taken in her lovely prime.\n\nThe third day after Ruth's death, a gentleman came to the door and\nasked to speak to Mr Benson. He was very much wrapped up in furs and\ncloaks, and the upper, exposed part of his face was sunk and hollow,\nlike that of one but partially recovered from illness. Mr and Miss\nBenson were at Mr Farquhar's, gone to see Leonard, and poor old Sally\nhad been having a hearty cry over the kitchen fire before answering\nthe door-knock. Her heart was tenderly inclined just then towards any\none who had the aspect of suffering; so, although her master was out,\nand she was usually chary of admitting strangers, she proposed to Mr\nDonne (for it was he) that he should come in and await Mr Benson's\nreturn in the study. He was glad enough to avail himself of her\noffer; for he was feeble and nervous, and come on a piece of business\nwhich he exceedingly disliked, and about which he felt very awkward.\nThe fire was nearly, if not quite, out; nor did Sally's vigorous\nblows do much good, although she left the room with an assurance that\nit would soon burn up. He leant against the chimney-piece, thinking\nover events, and with a sensation of discomfort, both external and\ninternal, growing and gathering upon him. He almost wondered whether\nthe proposal he meant to make with regard to Leonard could not be\nbetter arranged by letter than by an interview. He became very\nshivery, and impatient of the state of indecision to which his bodily\nweakness had reduced him.\n\nSally opened the door and came in. \"Would you like to walk upstairs,\nsir?\" asked she, in a trembling voice, for she had learnt who the\nvisitor was from the driver of the fly, who had run up to the house\nto inquire what was detaining the gentleman that he had brought from\nthe Queen's Hotel; and, knowing that Ruth had caught the fatal fever\nfrom her attendance on Mr Donne, Sally imagined that it was but a\npiece of sad civility to invite him upstairs to see the poor dead\nbody, which she had laid out and decked for the grave, with such fond\ncare that she had grown strangely proud of its marble beauty.\n\nMr Donne was glad enough of any proposal of a change from the\ncold and comfortless room where he had thought uneasy, remorseful\nthoughts. He fancied that a change of place would banish the train of\nreflection that was troubling him; but the change he anticipated was\nto a well-warmed, cheerful sitting-room, with signs of life, and a\nbright fire therein; and he was on the last flight of stairs,--at the\ndoor of the room where Ruth lay--before he understood whither Sally\nwas conducting him. He shrank back for an instant, and then a strange\nsting of curiosity impelled him on. He stood in the humble low-roofed\nattic, the window open, and the tops of the distant snow-covered\nhills filling up the whiteness of the general aspect. He muffled\nhimself up in his cloak, and shuddered, while Sally reverently drew\ndown the sheet, and showed the beautiful, calm, still face, on which\nthe last rapturous smile still lingered, giving an ineffable look\nof bright serenity. Her arms were crossed over her breast; the\nwimple-like cap marked the perfect oval of her face, while two braids\nof the waving auburn hair peeped out of the narrow border, and lay on\nthe delicate cheeks.\n\nHe was awed into admiration by the wonderful beauty of that dead\nwoman.\n\n\"How beautiful she is!\" said he, beneath his breath. \"Do all dead\npeople look so peaceful--so happy?\"\n\n\"Not all,\" replied Sally, crying. \"Few has been as good and as gentle\nas she was in their lives.\" She quite shook with her sobbing.\n\nMr Donne was disturbed by her distress.\n\n\"Come, my good woman! we must all die--\" he did not know what to say,\nand was becoming infected by her sorrow. \"I am sure you loved her\nvery much, and were very kind to her in her lifetime; you must take\nthis from me to buy yourself some remembrance of her.\" He had pulled\nout a sovereign, and really had a kindly desire to console her, and\nreward her, in offering it to her.\n\nBut she took her apron from her eyes, as soon as she became aware of\nwhat he was doing, and, still holding it midway in her hands, she\nlooked at him indignantly, before she burst out:\n\n\"And who are you, that think to pay for my kindness to her by money?\nAnd I was not kind to you, my darling,\" said she, passionately\naddressing the motionless, serene body--\"I was not kind to you. I\nfrabbed you, and plagued you from the first, my lamb! I came and cut\noff your pretty locks in this very room--I did--and you said never\nan angry word to me;--no! not then, nor many a time after, when I\nwas very sharp and cross to you.--No! I never was kind to you, and\nI dunnot think the world was kind to you, my darling,--but you are\ngone where the angels are very tender to such as you--you are, my\npoor wench!\" She bent down and kissed the lips, from whose marble,\nunyielding touch Mr Donne recoiled, even in thought.\n\nJust then, Mr Benson entered the room. He had returned home before\nhis sister, and come upstairs in search of Sally, to whom he wanted\nto speak on some subject relating to the funeral. He bowed in\nrecognition of Mr Donne, whom he knew as the member for the town, and\nwhose presence impressed him painfully, as his illness had been the\nproximate cause of Ruth's death. But he tried to check this feeling,\nas it was no fault of Mr Donne's. Sally stole out of the room, to cry\nat leisure in her kitchen.\n\n\"I must apologise for being here,\" said Mr Donne. \"I was hardly\nconscious where your servant was leading me to, when she expressed\nher wish that I should walk upstairs.\"\n\n\"It is a very common idea in this town, that it is a gratification to\nbe asked to take a last look at the dead,\" replied Mr Benson.\n\n\"And in this case I am glad to have seen her once more,\" said Mr\nDonne. \"Poor Ruth!\"\n\nMr Benson glanced up at him at the last word. How did he know her\nname? To him she had only been Mrs Denbigh. But Mr Donne had no idea\nthat he was talking to one unaware of the connexion that had formerly\nexisted between them; and, though he would have preferred carrying on\nthe conversation in a warmer room, yet, as Mr Benson was still gazing\nat her with sad, lingering love, he went on:\n\n\"I did not recognise her when she came to nurse me; I believe I was\ndelirious. My servant, who had known her long ago, in Fordham, told\nme who she was. I cannot tell how I regret that she should have died\nin consequence of her love of me.\"\n\nMr Benson looked up at him again, a stern light filling his eyes\nas he did so. He waited impatiently to hear more, either to quench\nor confirm his suspicions. If she had not been lying there, very\nstill and calm, he would have forced the words out of Mr Donne, by\nsome abrupt question. As it was, he listened silently, his heart\nquick-beating.\n\n\"I know that money is but a poor compensation,--is no remedy for this\nevent, or for my youthful folly.\"\n\nMr Benson set his teeth hard together, to keep in words little short\nof a curse.\n\n\"Indeed, I offered her money to almost any amount before;--do me\njustice, sir,\" catching the gleam of indignation on Mr Benson's face;\n\"I offered to marry her, and provide for the boy as if he had been\nlegitimate. It's of no use recurring to that time,\" said he, his\nvoice faltering; \"what is done cannot be undone. But I came now to\nsay, that I should be glad to leave the boy still under your charge,\nand that every expense you think it right to incur in his education\nI will defray;--and place a sum of money in trust for him--say,\ntwo thousand pounds--or more: fix what you will. Of course, if you\ndecline retaining him, I must find some one else; but the provision\nfor him shall be the same, for my poor Ruth's sake.\"\n\nMr Benson did not speak. He could not, till he had gathered some\npeace from looking at the ineffable repose of the Dead.\n\nThen, before he answered, he covered up her face; and in his voice\nthere was the stillness of ice.\n\n\"Leonard is not unprovided for. Those that honoured his mother will\ntake care of him. He shall never touch a penny of your money. Every\noffer of service you have made, I reject in his name,--and in her\npresence,\" said he, bending towards the Dead. \"Men may call such\nactions as yours, youthful follies! There is another name for them\nwith God. Sir! I will follow you downstairs.\"\n\nAll the way down, Mr Benson heard Mr Donne's voice urging and\nentreating, but the words he could not recognise for the thoughts\nthat filled his brain--the rapid putting together of events that was\ngoing on there. And when Mr Donne turned at the door, to speak again,\nand repeat his offers of service to Leonard, Mr Benson made answer,\nwithout well knowing whether the answer fitted the question or not:\n\n\"I thank God, you have no right, legal or otherwise, over the child.\nAnd for her sake, I will spare him the shame of ever hearing your\nname as his father.\"\n\nHe shut the door in Mr Donne's face.\n\n\"An ill-bred, puritanical old fellow! He may have the boy, I am sure,\nfor aught I care. I have done my duty, and will get out of this\nabominable place as soon as I can. I wish my last remembrance of my\nbeautiful Ruth was not mixed up with all these people.\"\n\nMr Benson was bitterly oppressed with this interview; it disturbed\nthe peace with which he was beginning to contemplate events. His\nanger ruffled him, although such anger had been just, and such\nindignation well deserved; and both had been unconsciously present in\nhis heart for years against the unknown seducer, whom he met face to\nface by the death-bed of Ruth.\n\nIt gave him a shock which he did not recover from for many days. He\nwas nervously afraid lest Mr Donne should appear at the funeral; and\nnot all the reasons he alleged to himself against this apprehension,\nput it utterly away from him. Before then, however, he heard casually\n(for he would allow himself no inquiries) that he had left the town.\nNo! Ruth's funeral passed over in calm and simple solemnity. Her\nchild, her own household, her friend, and Mr Farquhar, quietly walked\nafter the bier, which was borne by some of the poor to whom she had\nbeen very kind in her lifetime. And many others stood aloof in the\nlittle burying-ground, sadly watching that last ceremony.\n\nThey slowly dispersed; Mr Benson leading Leonard by the hand, and\nsecretly wondering at his self-restraint. Almost as soon as they had\nlet themselves into the Chapel-house, a messenger brought a note from\nMrs Bradshaw, with a pot of quince marmalade, which, she said to Miss\nBenson, she thought that Leonard might fancy, and if he did, they\nwere to be sure and let her know, as she had plenty more; or, was\nthere anything else that he would like? She would gladly make him\nwhatever he fancied.\n\nPoor Leonard! he lay stretched on the sofa, white and tearless,\nbeyond the power of any such comfort, however kindly offered; but\nthis was only one of the many homely, simple attentions, which all\ncame round him to offer, from Mr Grey, the rector, down to the\nnameless poor who called at the back door to inquire how it fared\nwith _her_ child.\n\nMr Benson was anxious, according to Dissenting custom, to preach an\nappropriate funeral sermon. It was the last office he could render to\nher; it should be done well and carefully. Moreover, it was possible\nthat the circumstances of her life, which were known to all, might\nbe made effective in this manner to work conviction of many truths.\nAccordingly, he made great preparation of thought and paper; he\nlaboured hard, destroying sheet after sheet--his eyes filling with\ntears between-whiles, as he remembered some fresh proof of the\nhumility and sweetness of her life. Oh, that he could do her justice!\nbut words seemed hard and inflexible, and refused to fit themselves\nto his ideas. He sat late on Saturday, writing; he watched through\nthe night till Sunday morning was far advanced. He had never taken\nsuch pains with any sermon, and he was only half satisfied with it\nafter all.\n\nMrs Farquhar had comforted the bitterness of Sally's grief by giving\nher very handsome mourning. At any rate, she felt oddly proud and\nexulting when she thought of her new black gown; but when she\nremembered why she wore it, she scolded herself pretty sharply for\nher satisfaction, and took to crying afresh with redoubled vigour.\nShe spent the Sunday morning in alternately smoothing down her skirts\nand adjusting her broad hemmed collar, or bemoaning the occasion with\ntearful earnestness. But the sorrow overcame the little quaint vanity\nof her heart, as she saw troop after troop of humbly-dressed mourners\npass by into the old chapel. They were very poor--but each had\nmounted some rusty piece of crape, or some faded black ribbon.\nThe old came halting and slow--the mothers carried their quiet,\nawe-struck babes.\n\nAnd not only these were there--but others--equally unaccustomed to\nnonconformist worship: Mr Davis, for instance, to whom Sally acted\nas chaperone; for he sat in the minister's pew, as a stranger; and,\nas she afterwards said, she had a fellow-feeling with him, being a\nChurch-woman herself, and Dissenters had such awkward ways; however,\nshe had been there before, so she could set him to rights about their\nfashions.\n\nFrom the pulpit, Mr Benson saw one and all--the well-filled Bradshaw\npew--all in deep mourning, Mr Bradshaw conspicuously so (he would\nhave attended the funeral gladly if they would have asked him)--the\nFarquhars--the many strangers--the still more numerous poor--one or\ntwo wild-looking outcasts, who stood afar off, but wept silently and\ncontinually. Mr Benson's heart grew very full.\n\nHis voice trembled as he read and prayed. But he steadied it as he\nopened his sermon--his great, last effort in her honour--the labour\nthat he had prayed God to bless to the hearts of many. For an instant\nthe old man looked on all the upturned faces, listening, with wet\neyes, to hear what he could say to interpret that which was in their\nhearts, dumb and unshaped, of God's doings as shown in her life.\nHe looked, and, as he gazed, a mist came before him, and he could\nnot see his sermon, nor his hearers, but only Ruth, as she had\nbeen--stricken low, and crouching from sight, in the upland field by\nLlan-dhu--like a woeful, hunted creature. And now her life was over!\nher struggle ended! Sermon and all was forgotten. He sat down, and\nhid his face in his hands for a minute or so. Then he arose, pale and\nserene. He put the sermon away, and opened the Bible, and read the\nseventh chapter of Revelations, beginning at the ninth verse.\n\nBefore it was finished, most of his hearers were in tears. It came\nhome to them as more appropriate than any sermon could have been.\nEven Sally, though full of anxiety as to what her fellow-Churchman\nwould think of such proceedings, let the sobs come freely as she\nheard the words:\n\n\n   And he said to me, These are they which came out of great\n   tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them\n   white in the blood of the Lamb.\n\n   Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve\n   him day and night in his temple; and he that sitteth on\n   the throne shall dwell among them.\n\n   They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;\n   neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.\n\n   For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall\n   feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of\n   waters, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\n\n\n\"He preaches sermons sometimes,\" said Sally, nudging Mr Davis, as\nthey rose from their knees at last. \"I make no doubt there was as\ngrand a sermon in yon paper-book as ever we hear in church. I've\nheard him pray uncommon fine--quite beyond any but learned folk.\"\n\nMr Bradshaw had been anxious to do something to testify his respect\nfor the woman, who, if all had entertained his opinions, would have\nbeen driven into hopeless sin. Accordingly, he ordered the first\nstonemason of the town to meet him in the chapel-yard on Monday\nmorning, to take measurement and receive directions for a tombstone.\nThey threaded their way among the grassy heaps to where Ruth was\nburied, in the south corner, beneath the great Wych-elm. When they\ngot there, Leonard raised himself up from the new-stirred turf. His\nface was swollen with weeping; but when he saw Mr Bradshaw he calmed\nhimself, and checked his sobs, and, as an explanation of being where\nhe was when thus surprised, he could find nothing to say but the\nsimple words:\n\n\"My mother is dead, sir.\"\n\nHis eyes sought those of Mr Bradshaw with a wild look of agony, as\nif to find comfort for that great loss in human sympathy; and at the\nfirst word--the first touch of Mr Bradshaw's hand on his shoulder--he\nburst out afresh.\n\n\"Come, come! my boy!--Mr Francis, I will see you about this\nto-morrow--I will call at your house.--Let me take you home, my poor\nfellow. Come, my lad, come!\"\n\nThe first time, for years, that he had entered Mr Benson's house, he\ncame leading and comforting her son--and, for a moment, he could not\nspeak to his old friend, for the sympathy which choked up his voice,\nand filled his eyes with tears.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RUTH***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 4275-8.txt or 4275-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/4\/2\/7\/4275\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1410,"split":"test"}
