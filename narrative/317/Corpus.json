{"ori_id":"48e4a4f877a7b8844de565b4dc1269db01803435","title":"Get Low (film)","context":"Get Low (film)\n No one really knows Felix Bush (Robert Duvall), who lives as a hermit deep in the woods. Rumors surround him, such as how he might have killed in cold blood, and that he's in league with the devil. So the town is surprised when Felix shows up in town with a fat wad of cash, requesting a \"funeral party\" at Reverend Gus Horton's church for himself. Rev. Horton declines this proposal. Frank Quinn (Bill Murray), the owner of the local funeral parlor in financial trouble, coveting Bush's wad of cash, agrees to advertise a funeral party at which the townsfolk will be invited to tell Felix Bush the stories they've heard about him. To ensure a good turnout, a lottery is organized, with Bush's property as the prize. Many people buy tickets.\nThings get more complicated when an old mystery is remembered, involving a local widow named Mattie Darrow (Sissy Spacek), who was Bush's girlfriend in their youth, and her deceased sister, Mary Lee Stroup (Arin Logan). With the help of a preacher who insists on Bush telling Mattie the truth, Bush tells those gathered at his funeral party (including Mattie) what happened forty years earlier. He reveals his affair with Mattie's married sister, Mary Lee. He confesses to Mattie that it was Mary Lee who was his true love, his only love. They made plans to run away together, and when she didn't arrive at the agreed place, he went to her home to search for her. He discovered that her husband had attacked her with a hammer, knocking her out. The husband threw a kerosene lamp against a wall to set the house on fire and kill himself, the unconscious Mary Lee, and Bush. Bush freed himself from the attacking husband, but as his clothes caught fire, he also saw Mary Lee catch fire. As he went to put the fire out, he felt himself flying through the window, possibly pushed by the husband, and he was unable to re-enter the house to save Mary Lee.\nMattie returns, seeming to forgive Bush. He sees what appears to be the ghost of Mary Lee down the lane. He dies shortly after his funeral party. His actual funeral service is held on a burial plot on his property. Charlie officiates the ceremony, with Reverend Gus Horton, Buddy, his wife and child, Mattie and Frank in attendance. After a short benediction from Charlie, Mattie places a portrait of her sister, Mary Lee on Felix's casket, signifying her forgiveness of his past actions and allowing them to be together, even if only figuratively. The mourners leave Felix's property as his grave is filled.\n<html>\n<head><title>Get Low Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Get Low script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Get Low script, Get Low movie script, Get Low film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

HOUSE - NIGHT 1\n<\/b>\n          From a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell\n          fire engulfing a small two story house. It burns and burns.\n          Out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window,\n          lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes.\n          He crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if\n          he might run back into the flames.

BUSH'S BARN - EARLY MORNING\/CONTINUOUS 3\n<\/b>\n          Panting in terror, Tom is hunkered down in strips of light,\n          trying to see through the cracks. There is a loud SNORT and\n          the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his\n          shoulder.\n          Tom jumps, panicked, just as a SHADOWY FIGURE creeps into the\n          barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him!\n          Tom freezes, bends over, and throws up!\n          When Tom looks up, a ray of light reveals the half face of a\n          fierce gray bearded man, FELIX BUSH. He is holding out a\n          handkerchief to the boy. Shaking hard, Tom hesitates then\n          takes it and wipes his mouth.\n          Bush pushes open the door and gives Tom a sad look that the\n          boy will never forget before waving him away.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>          2.\n<\/b>\n<b>          4 EXT.

He wears an old\n          mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold. He fidgets\n          nervously from all the excitement.

He finds\n          what he's looking for: A PICTURE of a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN.\n          She smiles at us from happier days.

BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 165\n<\/b>\n          Bush sits on the edge his bed. His face is drawn and haunted.\n          The door open and closes. He doesn't look up.\n          Mattie sits down beside him. Tears are streaming down her\n          face. She lays her head gently on his shoulder.\n\n<b>                         MATTIE\n<\/b>          Oh, Felix..\n          He sniffs her hair and tenderly touches it.\n\n<b>                         BUSH\n<\/b>          Wonder if her hair would be white?\n\n<b>          166 EXT.

Buddy takes the baby\n          and holds it close.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>          99.\n<\/b>          Finally Mattie and Bush come out of the shack and walk down\n          to the others.

There is no back seat so they\n          all have to crawl in the back door and sit along the sides.\n          It makes everyone smile. Mattie gives Bush one last fleeting\n          embrace then climbs in. Bush looks in on them all for a long\n          moment all then closes the door.\n          As the hearse moves out, he waves to Buddy who is looking out\n          the back window.

He squints, recognizes her, and his face fills\n          with a timeless love.\n\n<b>          168 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER 168\n<\/b>\n          It's a cold day beneath the spreading pecan tree. Mule stands\n          hitched to the wagon. The three dog grave markers are\n          frosted.\n          A fourth grave marker just like the others leans against the\n          tree. It is freshly carved with: Felix Elijah Bush. A pot of\n          fresh yellow flowers sit beside the marker.\n          Bush's beautiful handmade casket is inside his grave.\n          Frank, Mattie, Charlie, Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton stand\n          beside the grave. Several MEN with shovels wait near the\n          tree. Charlie's eulogy is more of a one-sided conversation\n          which Bush would probably love.\n\n<b>                         CHARLIE\n<\/b>          Well, Felix, this one's for real, I\n          guess.

I wish you peace from\n          the burdens of your mind and heart.\n          I wish it for us all.\n          Mattie moves toward the edge of the grave. Frank puts a hand\n          out to catch her should she should stumble. She stares down\n          at the FB on the coffin, opens her hand, and lets the picture\n          of her sister drift down onto the coffin.\n\n<b>          169 EXT.

As the laughter\n          fades we see in their faces the impact that Felix Bush has\n          had upon them. Buddy feels the comfort of this odd but\n          growing family and stops and looks back at the grave and the\n          pot of yellow flowers. His curiosity about the fearsome old\n          man has not abated.
