{"ori_id":"f0a45e1d3a587d322c7629727fd448303fb82a43","title":"Up the Down Staircase","context":"Up the Down Staircase\n The plot revolves around Sylvia Barrett, an idealistic English language teacher at an inner-city high school who hopes to nurture her students' interest in classic literature (especially Chaucer and writing). She quickly becomes discouraged during her first year of teaching, frustrated by bureaucracy, the indifference of her students, and the incompetence of many of her colleagues. The title of the book is taken from a memo telling her why a student was being punished: he had gone \"up the down staircase\". She decides to leave the public school (government funded) system to work in a smaller private setting. She changes her mind, though, when she realizes that she has, indeed, touched the lives of her students.\nThe novel is epistolary; aside from opening and closing chapters consisting entirely of dialogue the story is told through memos from the office, fragments of notes dropped in the trash can, essays handed in to be graded, lesson plans, suggestions dropped in the class suggestion box, and most often by inter-classroom notes that are a dialogue between Sylvia and an older teacher. Sylvia also writes letters to a friend from college who chose to get married and start a family rather than pursuing a career. The letters serve as a recap and summary of key events in the book, and offer a portrait of women's roles and responsibilities in American society in the mid-1960s.\nAn inter-classroom note in which the older teacher is translating the jargon of the memos from the office includes the memorable epigram \"'Let it be a challenge to you' means you're stuck with it.\" Calling a trash can a circular file comes from the same memo: \"'Keep on file in numerical order' means throw in waste-basket.\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Up and Down, by Edward Frederic Benson\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

I greet the new heaven\nand the new earth, or, perhaps more accurately, the beloved old heaven\nand the beloved old earth; I hail the sun, and know that something\nwithin me has slept and dreamed and yearned while I lived up in the\nnorth, and wakes again now with the awakening of Br\u00c3\u00bcnnhilde....\n\nThe conviction is as unfathomable and as impervious to analysis as the\nsprings of character, and if it is an illusion I am deceived by it as\ncompletely as by some master-trick of conjuring. It is not merely that\nI love for their own sakes the liquid and dustless thoroughfares of\nVenice, the dim cool churches and galleries that glow with the jewels\nof Bellini and Tintoret, the push of the gliding gondola round the\ncorners of the narrow canals beneath the mouldering cornices and mellow\nbrickwork, for I should love these things wherever they happened to be,\nand the actual spell of Venice would be potent if Venice was situated\nin the United States of America or in Manchester. But right at the back\nof all Venetian sounds and scents and sights sits enthroned the fact\nthat the theatre of those things is in Italy. Florence has her spell,\ntoo, when from the hills above it in the early morning you see her\nhundred towers pricking the mists; Rome the imperial has her spell,\nwhen at sunset you wander through the Forum and see the small blue\ncampanulas bubbling out of the crumbling travertine, while the Coliseum\nglows like a furnace of molten amber, or pushing aside the leather\ncurtain you pass into the huge hushed halls of St. Peter's; Naples has\nher spell, and the hill-side of Assisi hers, but all these are but the\nblossoms that cluster on the imperishable stem that nourishes them. Yet\nfor all the waving of these wands, it is not Bellini nor Tintoret, nor\nPope nor Emperor who gives the spells their potency, but Italy, the\nfact of Italy. Indeed (if in soul you are an Italian) you will find\nthe spell not only and not so fully in the churches and forums and\ngalleries of cities, but on empty hill-sides and in orchards, where the\nvine grows in garlands from tree to tree, and the purple clusters of\nshadowed grapes alternate with the pale sunshine of the ripened lemons.\nThere, more than among marbles, you get close to that which the lover\nof Italy adores in her inviolable shrine, and if you say that such\nadoration is very easily explicable since lemon trees and vines are\nbeautiful things, we will take some example that shall be really devoid\nof beauty to anyone who has not Italy in his heart, but to her lover is\nmore characteristic of her than any of her conventional manifestations.\n\nSo imagine yourself standing on a hilly road ankledeep in dust. On one\nside of it is a wine-shop, in the open doorway of which sits a lean,\ndishevelled cat, while from the dim interior there oozes out a stale\nsour smell of spilt wine mingled with the odour of frying oil. A rough\nwooden balcony projects from the stained stucco of the house-front,\nand on the lip of the balcony is perched a row of petroleum tins, in\nwhich are planted half a dozen unprosperous carnations. An oblong of\nsharp-edged shadow stretches across the road; but you, the lover of\nItaly, stand in the white of the scorching sunshine, blinded by the\ndazzle, choked by the dust, and streaming with the heat. On the side of\nthe road opposite the wine-shop is a boulder-built wall, buttressing\nthe hillside; a little behind the wall stands a grey-foliaged\nolive-tree, and on the wall, motionless but tense as a curled spring,\nlies a dappled lizard. From somewhere up the road comes the jingle of\nbells and the sound of a cracked whip, and presently round the corner\nswings a dingy little victoria drawn by two thin horses decorated\nbetween their ears with a plume of a pheasant's tail feathers. The\ndriver sits cross-legged on the box, with a red flower behind his ear,\nand inside are three alien English folk with puggarees and parasols\nand Baedekers. You step aside into the gutter to avoid the equipage,\nand as he passes, the driver, with a white-toothed smile, raises and\nflourishes his hat and says, \"Giorno, signor!\" The lizard darts into\na crevice from which his tail protrudes, the carriage yaws along in a\ncloud of dust.... It all sounds marvellously ugly and uncomfortable,\nand yet, if you are an exiled Italian, the thought of it will bring\nyour heart into your mouth.\n\nIt was just this, of which I have given the unvarnished but faithful\njotting, that I saw this morning as I came up from my bathe, and all\nat once it struck me that this, after all, more than all the forums\nand galleries, and gleams of past splendour and glory of light and\nlandscape, revealed Italy. But that was all there was to it, the sense\nof the lizard and the dust and the _trattoria,_ and yet never before\nhad my mistress worn so translucent a veil, or so nearly shown me the\nsecret of her elusive charm. Never had I come so near to catching it;\nfor the moment, as the Baedekers went by, I thought that by contrast\nI should comprehend at last what it is that makes to me the sense of\nhome in the \"dark and fierce and fickle south,\" as one of our Laureates\nso inappropriately calls it, having no more sympathy with Italy than I\nwith Lapland. For the moment the secret was trembling in the spirit,\nready to flower in the understanding.... But then it passed away\nagain in the dust or the wine-smell, and when I tried to express to\nFrancis at lunch in beautiful language what I have here written, he\nthought it over impartially, and said: \"It sounds like when you all but\nsneeze, and can't quite manage it.\" And there was point in that prosaic\nreflection: the secret remained inaccessible somewhere within me, like\nthe sneeze.\n\nFrancis has been an exceedingly wise person in the conduct of his life.\nSome fifteen years ago he settled, much to the dismay of his uncle, who\nthought that all gentlemen were stockbrokers, that he liked Italy much\nbetter than any other country in the world, and that, of all the towns\nand mountains and plains of Italy, he loved best this rocky pinnacle of\nan island that rises sheer from the sapphire in the mouth of the Bay of\nNaples. Thus, having come across from Naples for the inside of a day,\nhe telegraphed to his hotel for his luggage and stopped a month. After\na brief absence in England, feverish with interviews, he proceeded\nto stop here for a year, and, when that year was over, to stop here\npermanently. He was always unwell in England and always well here;\nthere was no material reason why he should ever return to the fogs,\nnor any moral reason except that the English idea of duty seems to be\ninextricably entwined with the necessity of doing something you dislike\nand are quite unfitted for. So herein he showed true wisdom, firstly,\nin knowing what he liked, and secondly, in doing it. For many otherwise\nsensible people have not the slightest idea what they like, and a\nlarge proportion of that elect remainder have not the steadfastness\nto do it. But Francis, with no ties that bound him to the island of\nEngland, which did not suit him at all, had the good sense to make his\nhome in this island of Italy that did. Otherwise he most certainly\nwould have lived an\u00c3\u00a6mically in an office in the City, and have amassed\nmoney that he did not in the least want. And though it was thought very\nodd that he should have chosen to be cheerful and busy here rather\nthan occupied and miserable in London, I applaud the unworldliness of\nhis wisdom. He settled also (which is a rarer wisdom) that he wanted\nto think, and, as you will see before this record of diary is out, he\nsucceeded in so doing.\n\nMany Mays and Junes I spent with him here, and six months ago now,\nwhile I was groping and choking in the fogs, he wrote to me, saying\nthat the Villa Tiberiana, at which we had for years cast longing\nglances as at a castle in Spain, was to be let on lease. It was too\nbig for him alone, but if I felt inclined to go shares in the rent, we\nmight take it together. I sent an affirmative telegram, and sat stewing\nwith anxiety till I received his favourable reply. So, when a fortnight\nago I returned here, I made my return home not to Italy alone, but to\nmy home in Italy.\n\nThe Villa Tiberiana, though not quite so imperial as it sounds, is one\nof the most \"amiable dwellings.\" It stands high on the hill-side above\nthe huddled, picturesque little town of Alatri, and is approachable\nonly by a steep cobbled path that winds deviously between other\nscattered houses and plots of vineyard. Having arrived at the piazza\nof the town, the carriage road goes no further, and you must needs\nwalk, while your luggage is conveyed up by strapping female porters,\nwhom on their arrival you reward with _soldi_ and refresh with wine.\nWhitewashed and thick-built, two-storied and flat-roofed, it crouches\nbehind the tall rubble wall of its garden that lies in terraces below\nit. A great stone-pine rears its whispering umbrella in the middle of\nthis plot, and now in the May-time of the year there is to be seen\nscarcely a foot of the earth of its garden beds, so dense is the\ntapestry of flowers that lies embroidered over it. For here in the\nfar south of Europe, the droughts of summer and early autumn render\nunpractical any horticultural legislation with a view to securing\ncolour in your flower-beds all the year round. However much you\nlegislated, you would never get your garden to be gay through July\nand August, and so, resigning yourself to emptiness then, you console\nyourself with an intoxication of blossom from March to June. And never\nwas a garden so drunk with colour as is ours to-day; never have I seen\nso outrageous a riot. Nor is it in the garden-beds alone that rose and\ncarnation and hollyhock and nasturtium and delphinium unpunctually but\nsimultaneously sing and blaze together. The southern front of the house\nis hidden in plumbago and vines with green seed-pearl berries, and as\nfor the long garden wall, it is literally invisible under the cloak of\nblue morning-glory that decks it as with a raiment from foundation to\ncoping-stone. Every morning fresh battalions of blue trumpets deploy\nthere as soon as the sun strikes it, and often as I have seen it thus,\nI cannot bring myself to believe that it is real; it is more like some\namazing theatrical decoration. Beyond on the further side lies the\norchard of fig and peach, and I observe with some emotion that the\nfigs, like the lady in Pickwick, are swelling visibly.\n\nWithin, the house has assumed its summer toilet, which is another way\nof saying that it has been undressed; carpets and curtains have been\nbanished; doors are latched back, and the air sweeps softly from end\nto end of it. A sitting-room that faces south has been dismantled, and\nits contents put in the big studio that looks northwards, and even in\nthe height of summer, we hope, will not get over-hot, especially since\na few days ago we had the roof whitewashed and thick matting hung over\nits one southern window. Breakfast and dinner, now that the true May\nweather has begun, we have on the terrace-top of the big cistern in the\ngarden, roofed over between the pilasters of its pergola with trellis,\nthrough which the vineleaves wriggle and wrestle. But now at noon it\nis too hot in the garden, and to-day I found lunch ready in the square\nvaulted little dining-room, with Pasqualino bringing in macaroni and\nvine-leaf-stoppered decanter, and Francis, who refrained from bathing\nthis morning owing to the Martha-cares of the household, debating\nwith Seraphina (the cook) as to whether the plumbago ought not to be\npruned. It has come right into the room, and, as Seraphina most justly\nremarks, it is already impossible to shut the window. But since we\nshall not need to shut the window for some months to come, I give my\nvote to support Francis, and suffer the plumbago to do exactly as it\nlikes. So we are two to one, and Seraphina takes her defeat, wreathed\nin smiles, and says it is not her fault if burglars come. That is a\npoor argument, for there are no burglars in Alatri, and, besides, there\nis nothing to steal except the grand piano....\n\nJust now social duties weigh rather heavily on Francis and me, for\nthe British colony in Alatri consider that, as we have moved into\na new house, they must behave to us as if we were new-comers, and\nhave been paying formal visits. These civilities must be responded\nto, and we have had two house-warmings and are going to have a third\nand last to-day. The house-warmings should perhaps be described as\ngarden-warmings, since we have tea on the terrace in great pomp,\nand then get cool in the house afterwards. Rather embarrassing\nincidents have occurred, as, for instance, when Miss Machonochie came\nto a garden-warming the day before yesterday. She is a red amiable\nScotchwoman, with a prodigious Highland accent, which Francis, whom\nshe has for years tried to marry, imitates to perfection. So perfect,\nindeed, is his mimicry of it, that when Miss Machonochie appeared and\nbegan to talk about the wee braw garden, Pasqualino, who was bringing\nout a fresh teapot, had to put it hurriedly down on the ground, and\nrun back again into the kitchen, from which issued peal after peal\nof laughter. So overcome was he, that after a second attempt (Miss\nMachonochie being still full of conversation) he had to retire again,\nand Seraphina must serve us till Miss Machonochie went away. This she\ndid not do for a long time, since, after just a little vermouth, she\nwanted no persuasion at all to sing a quantity of Scotch ditties about\nBonnie Charlie and Loch Lomond, and other beautiful and interesting\ntopics. Technically, I should say that she had one note in her voice,\nwhich she was in a great hurry to get on to and very loath to leave.\nThis had an amazing timbre like a steam siren, and as I played her\naccompaniment for her, my left ear sang all the evening afterwards.\nBut her accent was indubitably Highland, and Mrs. Macgregor declared\nshe could smell the heather. I was glad of that, for I was afraid that\nwhat I smelled (it being now near dinner-time) was the _fritura_ that\nSeraphina was preparing in the kitchen.\n\nThis island-life is the busiest sort of existence, though I suppose a\nstockbroker would say it was the laziest, and, in consequence, these\nsocial efforts give one a sense of rush that I have never felt in\nLondon. The whole of the morning is taken up with bathing (of which\nmore presently), and on the way up you call at the post-office for\npapers and letters. The letters it is impossible to answer immediately,\nsince there is so much to do, and the pile on my table grows steadily,\nwaiting for a wet day. After lunch you read the papers, and then,\nfollowing the example of the natives, who may be supposed to know the\nproper way of living in their own climate, you have a good siesta.\nAfter tea, the English habit of physical exercise asserts itself, and\nwe walk or water the garden till dinner. After dinner it is, I take\nit, permissible to have a little relaxation, and we either play a game\nor two of picquet up here in the studio, or more often stroll down to\nthe piazza and play in the caf\u00c3\u00a9, or attend a thrilling cinematograph\nshow. In the country it is natural to go to bed early, and, behold, it\nis to-morrow almost before you knew it was to-day. When it rains, or\nwhen the weather is cold, it is possible to do some work, and Francis\nasserts that he does an immense quantity during the winter. I daresay\nthat is so; I should be the last person to quarrel with the statement,\nsince he so amiably agrees that it is impossible to behave like that in\nthe summer.\n\nThe mind is equally well occupied, for we always take down books to the\nbathing-place, and for the rest the affairs of the island, Pasqualino\nand his family, Seraphina and her family, the fact that Mrs. Macgregor\nhas dismissed her cook, that Mr. Tarn has built a pergola, completely\nabsorb the intellectual and speculative faculties. What happens outside\nthe island seems not to matter at all. England, with its fogs and its\nfuss, is less real and much further away than the hazy shores of the\nmainland, where all that concerns us is the smoke of Vesuvius, which\nduring the last week has been increasing in volume, and now stands up\nabove the mountain like a huge stone-pine. The wiseacres shake their\nheads and prophesy an eruption, but _che sar\u00c3\u00a0, sar\u00c3\u00a0_--if it comes, it\ncomes, and meantime it is a marvellous thing to see the red level rays\nat sunset turn the edges of the smoke-cloud into wreaths of rose-colour\nand crimson; the denser portions they are unable to pierce, and can\nbut lay a wash of colour on them, through which the black shows like\na thing of nightmare. In the calm weather, which we have been having,\nthis stone-pine of smoke is reflected in the bay, and the great tree of\nvapour steals slowly across the water, nearer and nearer every day. The\nobservatory reports tell us that its topmost wreaths are eight vertical\nmiles away from the earth. Sometimes when it is quite calm here we see\nthese tops torn by winds and blown about into fantastic foliage, but\nthe solidity of the trunk remains untouched.\n\nBut Vesuvius is far away, twenty-five miles at the least, and here in\nthis siren, lotus-eating island nothing across the sea really interests\nus. But island affairs, as I have said, are perfectly absorbing, and\nduring this last fortnight we have been in vertiginous heights of\nexcitement. Only yesterday occurred the _finale_ of all this business,\nand Francis thinks with excellent reason, that he is accomplice to a\nfelony. The person chiefly concerned was Luigi, nephew of our cook\nSeraphina, who till six months ago was valet, butler, major-domo,\nand gardener to Francis. Then, in a misguided moment, he thought to\n\"better himself\" by going as hall-boy to the Grand Hotel in Alatri.\nThere were tips, no doubt, in the tourist season at the Grand Hotel,\nbut there was also trouble. It happened like this.\n\nFrom the day of the supposed crime the sympathy of the island generally\nwas on the side of Luigi, in the fiery trials that awaited him. It\nwas felt to be intolerable that a boy who had just changed into his\nbest clothes, and had taken a carnation from one of the tables in the\ndining-room, and was actually going out of the hotel gate to spend the\nafternoon of the _festa_ in the Piazza, should have been summarily\nordered back by the porter, and commanded to show a fat white German\ngentleman, who was staying in the hotel, the way to the bathing-place\nat the _Palazzo a mare,_ and carry his towels and bathing-dress for\nhim, the latter of which included sandals, so that the fat white\ngentleman should not hurt his fat white toes on the shingle. This\nabominable personage had also preferred, in the unaccountable manner of\nforeigners, to go all the way on foot, instead of taking a victoria,\nwhich would have conveyed him three-quarters of the distance and saved\nmuch time. But he would go on his feet, and being very fat had walked\nat tortoise-pace along the dusty road, under a large green umbrella,\nperspiring profusely, and stopping every now and then to sit down.\nThere was Luigi standing by, carrying the sandals and the bathing-dress\nand the towels, while all the time the precious moments of this holiday\nafternoon were slipping along, and the Piazza, where Luigi should have\nbeen (having been granted a half-holiday on account of the _festa_),\nwas full of his young friends, male and female, all in their best\nclothes, conversing and laughing together, and standing about and\nsmoking an occasional cigarette, in the orthodox fashion of a holiday\nafternoon. Then, after this interminable walk, during which the German\ngentleman kept asking the baffled Luigi a series of questions in an\nunknown tongue, and appeared singularly annoyed when the boy was unable\nto answer him except in a Tower-of-Babel manner, he drew three coppers\nfrom his pocket, and after a prolonged mental struggle, presented\nLuigi with two of them, as a reward for his services. He then told\nhim that he could find his way up again alone, and having undressed,\nswam majestically off round the promontory of rock that enclosed the\nbathing-beach.\n\nAn hour afterwards Luigi, defrauded of half his holiday afternoon,\nreturned to the gaiety and companionship of the Piazza, and recounted\nto an indignant audience this outrageous affair. But some time during\nthe afternoon, Francis, looking out of his bedroom window after his\nsiesta, thought he saw Luigi slipping across the garden of the Villa\nTiberiana, and climbing down over the wall at the bottom. He says he\nwas not sure, being still sleepy, and when he shouted Luigi's name out\nof his window, there came no answer.\n\nLuigi returned to the Grand Hotel in time to get into his livery again\nbefore dinner, and on entrance was summoned into the manager's bureau,\nwhere he was confronted with his Teutonic taskmaster of the afternoon,\nand charged with having picked his pocket while he was bathing. A\nportfolio was missing, containing a note for a hundred liras, and this\nthe German gentleman was gutturally certain he had on his person when\nhe started off to bathe, and equally certain that he had lost when he\ncame to dress for dinner. His certainty was partly founded on the fact\nthat he had tipped the boy when they arrived at the _Palazzo a mare,_\nand to have tipped him he must have had his money in his pocket. In\nanswer, Luigi absolutely denied the charge, and then made a dreadful\nmistake by suggesting that the Signor had a hole in his pocket, through\nwhich the portfolio had slipped. This was quite the most unfortunate\nthing he could have said, for, as the German gentleman instantly\ndemonstrated, the hole in his pocket was undoubtedly there. But how, so\nhe overpoweringly urged, could Luigi have known there was a hole there,\nunless he had been examining his pockets? And an hour later poor Luigi,\nwith gyves upon his wrists, was ignominiously led through the Piazza,\nall blazing with acetylene lights and resonant with the blare of the\nband, and was clapped into prison to await the formal charge.\n\nArrived there, he was searched, and a similar examination was made in\nhis room at his mother's house, where he went to sleep at night, but\nnothing that ever so remotely resembled a German portfolio or a note\nfor a hundred liras was found, and he still doggedly denied his guilt.\nThen, since nothing incriminating could be got out of him, the key\nwas turned, while through the small high-grated window came the sound\nof the band in the Piazza for this _festa_ night. Later, by standing\non his board bed, he could see the fiery segment of the aspiring path\nof the rockets, as they ascended from the peak above the Piazza, and\nlisten to the echo of their explosions flap and buffet against the\ncliffs of Monte Gennaro. But it was from prison that he saw and heard.\n\nOutside in the Piazza the tragic history of his incarceration formed a\nfine subject for talk, and public opinion, which cheerfully supposed\nhim guilty, found extenuating circumstances that almost amounted to\ninnocence. The provocation of being obliged to spend the best part\nof a _festa_ afternoon in walking down to the sea with a fat white\nTedesco was really immense, and the reward of twopence for those lost\nhours of holiday was nothing less than an insult. What wonder if Luigi\nfor a moment mislaid his honesty, what wonder if when so smooth-faced\nand ready-made a temptation came, he just yielded to it for a second?\nCertainly it was wrong to steal, everyone knows that--_Mamma mia,_\nwhat a rocket, what a _bellezza_ of stars!--but it was also primarily\nwrong to dock a jolly boy of his promised half-holiday. No wonder,\nwhen the German signor--ah, it was the same, no doubt, as was sick in\nAntonio's carriage the other day, and refused to pay for a new rug--no\nwonder, when that fat-head, that pumpkin (for who but a pumpkin would\ncarry a hundred liras about with him?) swam away round the corner of\nthose rocks, that Luigi's hand just paid a visit to his great pockets\nto see if he was as poor as that miserable tip of twopence seemed to\nsay! Then he found the portfolio, and turned bitter with the thought\nof the _quattro soldi_ which was all that had been given him for his\nloss of the half-holiday. Ah, look! Was it really a wheel like that\non which Santa Caterina had been bound? How she must have spun round!\nWhat giddiness! What burning! A steadfast soul not to have consented\nto worship Apollo; no wonder that Holy Church made a saint of her.\nBut what could Luigi have done with the portfolio and the note for a\nhundred liras? He had been searched and on him was nothing found; his\nroom had been searched, but there was nothing there. Was it possible\nthat he was innocent, _il povero?_ Could the sick German gentleman\nreally have lost his foolish pocket-book by natural means as he came up\nfrom his bathe? It might be worth while taking a walk there to-morrow,\nalways keeping a peeled eye on the margin of the path. It was possible,\nafter all, that he had lost his pocket-book all by himself, without aid\nfrom Luigi, for the hole in his pocket was admitted, and shown to the\nmanager of the Grand Hotel. But then there was Luigi's fatal knowledge\nof the hole in his pocket. That was very bad; that looked like guilt.\nIf only the boy had held his tongue and not said that fatal thing! He\nonly suggested that there was a hole in his pocket? No, no; he said\nthere _was_ a hole in his pocket, didn't he? What a lesson to keep the\ntongue still! Luigi had always a lot to learn about keeping the tongue\nstill, for who will soon forget the dreadful things he shouted out last\nwinter at the priest, his mother's cousin's uncle, when he had smacked\nhis head? They were quite true, too, like the hole in the pocket....\nAh, there is the great bomb. Pouf! How it echoes! So the fireworks are\nover! _Buona notte! Buona notte!_\n\nAll this, while lounging in the Piazza, listening to the band and\nwatching the fireworks, I heard from the tobacconist and the barber and\na few other friends. I coupled with this information that which Francis\ntold me as we strolled up homewards again, namely, that he thought\nhe had seen Luigi that afternoon slipping through the garden. He was\nnot sure about it, so leaving it aside, he recalled a few facts about\nLuigi when he was in his service. He used to hurry over his house-work\nalways, for he preferred his r\u00c3\u00b4le of gardener to all others, and used\nto wander among the flower-beds, making plants comfortable, and giving\nthis one a drop of water, and that a fresh piece of stick to lean\non. Then he would make a mud pie by turning on the cistern tap, and\nplant verbenas in it, or in more mysterious fashion made _caches_ in a\nhole behind loose masonry in the cistern wall. Francis has got a just\nappreciation of the secrecy and rapture of making _caches,_ and never\nlet Luigi know that he was aware of this hidden treasure. But after\nLuigi had gone home to his mother's of an evening, he would yield to\ncuriosity and see what the boy had put there. Sometimes there would\nbe a matchbox, or a pilfered cigarette, or a piece of string carefully\nwrapped up in paper.... And now poor Luigi was behind his grated\nwindow, and Seraphina, with deepest sarcasm, said that this was what he\ncalled bettering himself. He would have done better to have done worse\nand remained at the Villa Tiberiana in the service of the Signori.\n\nBut suddenly next day, like a change in the weather coming from\na cloudless sky, a fresh train of thought was suggested by the\nLuigi-episode, and the mention of the lottery, and how the various\nincidents and personages bore on the luck of numbers. On the instant\nLuigi and all he had done or not done ceased to interest anybody\nexcept in so far as the events were concerned with the science and\ninterpretation of numbers in the lottery as set forth in the amazing\nvolume called \"Smorfia.\" There you will find what any numeral means,\nso that should an earthquake occur or an eclipse, the wise speculator\nlooks out \"earthquake\" or \"eclipse\" in \"Smorfia,\" and at the next\ndrawing of the National Lottery or the lottery at Naples backs the\nnumbers to which these significations are attached. As it happened, no\nevent of striking local interest had occurred in Alatri since, in April\nlast, the carpenter in the Corso Agosto had unsuccessfully attempted to\ncut his throat with a razor, after successfully smothering his aunt.\nThis had been the last occasion on which there was clear guidance\nas to the choice of numbers in the Naples lottery, and nobody of a\nsporting turn of mind who had the smallest sense of the opportunities\nlife offers had failed to back No. 17, which among other things means\n\"aunt,\" and numbers which signified \"razor,\" \"throat,\" \"blood\" and\n\"bolster.\" Nor had \"Smorfia,\" the dictionary that gives this useful\ninformation, disappointed its adherents, for Carmine, Pasqualino's\nbrother, had backed the numbers that meant \"throat,\" \"razor,\"\n\"carpenter,\" \"aunt\" and \"Sunday,\" the last being the day on which those\ndistressing events occurred, and went to bed that night to dream of\nthe glories which awaited him who nominated a _quinterno secco._ (This\nmeans that you back five numbers, all of which come out in the order\nnamed.) Once, so succulent tradition said, a baker at the Marina had\naccomplished this enviable feat, after which Alatri saw him no more,\nfor his reward was a million francs, a marquisate and an estate in\nCalabria, where soon afterwards he was murdered for the sake of his\nmillion. This stimulating page of history was not wholly repeated in\nthe case of Carmine and the carpenter's aunt, but by his judicious\nselection he had certainly reaped two hundred francs where he had only\nsowed five. The doctor also, who had attended the abortive suicide, had\ndone very well by backing salient features of the tragedy, and astute\nsuperstition had, on the whole, been adequately rewarded.\n\nNext day, accordingly, the Piazza seethed with excitement as to the\ndue application of the Luigi episode to the enchanting Lorelei of\nthe lottery. It had magnificent and well-marked features; \"Smorfia\"\nshouted with opportunities. First of all, there was Luigi himself to\nbe backed, and, as everyone knew, \"boy\" was the number 2. Next there\nwas the German gentleman. (\"Michele, turn up 'German.'\") Then there\nwas \"pocket\" and \"hole\" and \"portfolio\" and \"bathe.\" All these were\nlikely chances. Other aspects of the affair struck the serious mind.\n\"_Festa_\" was connected with it; so, too, was \"prison,\" where now Luigi\nlanguished. Then there was \"theft\" and \"denial.\" Here were abundant\nmaterials for a _quinterno secco_, when once the initial difficulty\nof selecting the right numbers was surmounted. And marquisates and\nmillions hovered on the horizon, ready to move up and descend on Alatri.\n\nAmong those who were thus interested in the _affaire Luigi_ from the\npurely lottery point of view, there was no more eager student than the\nboy's mother. Maria was a confirmed and steadfast gambler, of that\noptimistic type that feels itself amply rewarded for the expenditure of\nten liras on a series of numbers that prove quite barren of reward, if\nat the eleventh attempt she gained five. She had been to see her son\nin prison, had wept a little and consoled him a little, had smuggled\na packet of cigarettes into his hand, and had reminded him that the\nsame sort of thing, though far worse, had happened to his father, with\nwhom be peace. For at the most Luigi would get but a couple of months\nin prison, owing to his youth (and the cool of the cell was really not\nunpleasant in the hot weather), and the severity of his sentence would\ndoubtless be much mitigated if he would only say where he had hidden\nthe portfolio and the hundred liras. But nothing would induce Luigi\nto do this; he still firmly adhered to his innocence, and repeated\n_ad nauseam_ his unfortunate remark that there was a hole in the fat\nGerman's pocket.\n\nExpostulation being useless, and Luigi being fairly comfortable, Maria\nleft him, and on her way home gave very serious consideration to the\nfeatures of the case which she intended to back at the lottery. She\nhad ascertained that Luigi had his new clothes on (which was the sort\nof flower on which that butterfly Chance alighted), and on looking up\nthe number of \"new clothes, novelty, freshness,\" found that it was\n8. Then, on further study of \"Smorfia,\" she learned that the word\n\"thief\" was represented by No. 28, and following her own train of\nthought, discovered that No. 88 meant \"liar.\" Here was a strange thing,\nespecially when, with an emotional spasm, she remembered that \"boy\" was\nNo. 2. Here was the whole adventure nutshelled for her. For was there\nnot a boy (2) who put on his new clothes (8), showed himself a thief\n(28) and subsequently a liar (88)? 2 and 8 covered the whole thing, and\nalmost throttled by the thread of coincidence, she hurried down to the\nlottery-office, aflame with the premonition of some staggering success,\nand invested fifteen liras in the numbers 2, 8, 28, 88.\n\nShe lingered in the Piazza a little, after laying this touching garland\non the altar of luck, to receive the condolences of her friends\non Luigi's wickedness, and had a kind word thrown to her by Signor\nGelotti, the great lawyer, who had come over for a week's holiday to\nhis native island. Ah, there was a man! Why, if he got you into the\nwitness-box, he could make you contradict yourself before you knew you\nhad opened your mouth. Give him a couple of minutes at you, and he\nwould make you say that the man you had described as having a black\ncoat and a moustache had no coat at all and whiskers, and that, though\nyou had met him at three o'clock precisely in the Piazza, you had just\ninformed the Court that at that hour you were having a siesta in your\nown house. Luigi's father had at one time been in his service, and\nthough he had left it, handcuffed, for a longer period of imprisonment\nthan his son was threatened with, Lawyer Gelotti had always a nod and a\nsmile for his widow, and to-day a pleasant little joke about heredity.\nAh, if Lawyer Gelotti would only take up the case! He would muddle\neverybody up finely, and in especial that fat German fellow, who, like\nhis beastly, swaggering, truculent race, was determined to press home\nhis charge. But Lawyer Gelotti, as all the world knew, never held up\nhis forefinger at a witness under a thousand liras. What a forefinger.\nIt made you tell two more lies in order to escape from each lie that\nyou had already told.\n\nThree days passed, while still Luigi languished behind bars, and\nthen a sudden thrill of excitement emanating from the offices of the\nlottery swept over the island. For the Naples lottery had been drawn,\nand the five winning numbers were issued, which in due order of their\noccurrence were 2, 8, 28, 4, 91. Alatri grew rosy with prospective\nriches, for in this _affaire Luigi_ it would have been slapping the\nface of the Providence that looks after lotteries not to have backed\nNo. 2 (boy) and No. 28 (thief). At least ten dutiful folk had done\nthat. But--_che peccato_--why did we not all back No. 8, as Luigi's\nmother had done, for we all knew that Luigi must have had his new\nclothes on, as did every boy on a _festa?_ What a thing it is to use\nrightly the knowledge you possess! The lucky woman! She had won a\n_terno,_ for the first three numbers she backed came out in the order\nshe nominated. Never was such a thing seen since the days of the\nclassical baker! Why, her _terno_ would be worth three thousand liras\nat least, which was next door to the title of a marchioness. But No.\n91 now: what does No. 91 mean? Quick, turn it up in \"Smorfia\"! Who has\na \"Smorfia?\" Ernesto, the tobacconist, of course, but he is a mean\nman, and will not lend his \"Smorfia\" to any who does not buy a packet\nof cigarettes. Never mind, let us have both; a cigarette is always a\ncigarette. There! No. 91! What does No. 91 signify? _Dio!_ What a lot\nof meanings! \"The man in the moon\" ... \"the hairs on the tail of an\nelephant\" ... \"an empty egg-shell.\" ... Who ever heard the like? There\nis no sense in such a number! And No. 4--what does No. 4 mean? Why, the\nvery first meaning of all is \"truth.\" There is a curious thing when we\nall thought that Luigi was telling lies! And No. 4, look you, was the\nfourth number that came out. It would have been simple to conjecture\nthat No. 4 would be No. 4. Pity that we did not think of that last\nweek. But it is easy to be wise after the event, as the bridegroom said.\n\nThe talk on the Piazza rose to ever loftier peaks of triumph as fresh\nbeneficiaries of Luigi, who had made a few liras over \"boy\" and\n\"thief,\" joined the chattering groups. He had done very well for his\nfriends, had poor Luigi, though \"pocket\" and \"portfolio\" had brought\nin nothing to their backers. And it was like him--already Luigi was\nconsidered directly responsible for these windfalls--it was like him to\nhave turned up that ridiculous No. 91, with its man in the moon, and\nits empty egg-shell. Luigi, the gay _ragazzo,_ loved that extravagant\nsort of joke, of which the point was that there was no point, but\nwhich made everybody laugh, as when he affixed a label, \"Three liras\ncomplete,\" to the fringe of Donna Margherita's new shawl from Naples\nas she walked about the Piazza, showing it off and never guessing\nwhat so many smiles meant. But No. 4, which stood for \"truth,\" it was\nstrange that No. 4 should have turned up, and that nobody dreamed of\nsupposing that Luigi was telling the truth. His mother, for all her\nwinnings, must be finely vexed that she had not trusted her son's word,\nand backed \"truth,\" instead of putting her money on \"liar.\" Why, if\nshe backed \"truth,\" she would have gained a _quaterno,_ and God knows\nhow many liras! Ah, there she is! Let us go and congratulate the good\nsoul. Her winnings will make up to her for having a son as well as a\nhusband who was a thief.\n\nBut Luigi's mother was in a hot haste. She had put on all her best\nclothes, not, as was at first conjectured, because in the affluence\nthat had come to her they had been instantly degraded into second-best,\nbut because she was making a business call on Lawyer Gelotti. She\nwas not one to turn her broad back on her own son--though it is true\nthat she had confidently selected No. 88 with its signification of\n\"liar\"--and if the satanic skill of Lawyer Gelotti could get Luigi off,\nthat skill was going to be invoked for his defence. A hundred thanks,\na hundred greetings to everybody, but she had no time for conversation\njust now. Lawyer Gelotti must be seen at once, if he was at home; if\nnot, she must just sit on his doorstep and wait for him. Yes; she had\nheard that a thousand liras was his fee, and he should have it, if that\nwas right and proper. There was plenty more where they came from! And\nthis _bravura_ passage pleased the Piazza; it showed the gaiety and\nswagger proper to a lady of property.\n\nIn due course followed the event which Alatri was quite prepared for\nwhen it knew that Lawyer Gelotti was engaged on Luigi's behalf, and\nthat the full blast of his hurricane of interrogations would be turned\non the fat German gentleman. Never was there such a tearing to shreds\nof apparently stout evidence; its fragments were scattered to all\npoints of the compass like the rocket-stars which Luigi had watched\nfrom his grated window. The Tedesco was forced to allow that he had\nnot looked in his pockets, to see if his portfolio was safe, till full\nthree hours after he had returned from his bathe. What had he done in\nthose three hours? He did not know? Then the Court would guess! (That\nwas nasty!) Again he had told the manager of the hotel that he knew\nhe had his portfolio with him when he went to bathe, because he had\ntipped the boy. Ah, that wonderful tip! Was it, or was it not twopence?\nYes: Lawyer Gelotti thought so! Twopence for carrying a basket of\ntowels and a bathing costume and two elephant sandals all over the\nisland! _Tante grazie!_ But was it really his custom to carry coppers\nin his portfolio? Did he not usually carry pence loose in a pocket?\nHad he ever to his knowledge carried pennies in his portfolio? Would\nhe swear that he had? Come, sir, do not keep the Court waiting for a\nsimple answer! Very good! This magnificent tip did not come out of the\nportfolio at all, as he had previously affirmed.\n\nLawyer Gelotti had a tremendous lunch at this stage of the proceedings,\nand tackled his German afterwards with renewed vigour. Was it credible\nthat a man so careful--let us say, so laudably careful--with his money\nas to make so miserly a tip, would have taken a portfolio containing a\nhundred liras down to the bathing-place, and left it in his clothes?\nAnd what was the number of this note? Surely this prudent, this\neconomical citizen of Germany, a man so scrupulously careful of his\nmoney as to tip on this scale, would have taken the precaution to have\nregistered the number of his note. Did he not usually do so? Yes. So\nLawyer Gelotti suspected. But in this case, very strangely, he had not.\nThat was odd; that was hard to account for except on the supposition\nthat there was no such note. And this portfolio, about which it seemed\nreally impossible to get accurate information? It was shabby, was\nit, and yet an hour before we had been told it was new! And who else\nhad ever set eyes on this wonderful portfolio, this new and ragged\nportfolio with its note of unknown number? Nobody; of course, nobody.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere followed a most disagreeable forensic picture of the fat German\ngentleman, while above him, as a stained glass window looks down on\nMephistopheles, Lawyer Gelotti proceeded to paint Luigi's portrait\nin such seraphic lines and colour that Maria, brimming with emotion,\nfelt that sixteen years ago she had given birth to a saint and had\nnever known it till now. Here was a boy who had lost his father--and\nGelotti's voice faltered as he spoke of this egregious scamp--who\nfrom morning till night slaved to support his stricken mother, and\nthrough all the self-sacrificing days of his spotless boyhood never\nhad suspicion or hint of sin come near him. The Court had heard how\nblithely and eagerly he had gone down to the _Palazzo a mare_--it\nwas as well the Court had not heard his blithe remarks as he passed\nthrough the Piazza--on the afternoon of what should have been his\nholiday. What made him so gay? Gentlemen, the thought that inspired him\nwas that by his service he might earn a franc or perhaps two francs,\nsince it was a _festa,_ to bring home to his aged parent. And what was\nhis reward? Twopence, twopence followed by this base and unfounded\nand disproved and diabolical accusation. Prison had been his reward;\nhe languished in a dungeon while all Alatri kept holiday and holy\nfestival. As for the admission of which the prosecution had made so\nmuch, namely, that Luigi had said that the German gentleman had a hole\nin his pocket, how rejoiced was Lawyer Gelotti that he had done so.\nIt was suggested that Luigi must have searched his clothes, and found\nthere the apocryphal portfolio and the note that had no number. But it\nwas true that Luigi was intimately acquainted with those voluminous\ntrousers. But how and why and when?... And Lawyer Gelotti paused, while\nLuigi's friends held their breath, not having the slightest idea of the\nanswer.\n\nLawyer Gelotti wiped his eyes and proceeded. This industrious saintly\nlad, the support of his mother's declining years, was hall-boy at the\nGrand Hotel. Numerous were the duties of a hall-boy, and Lawyer Gelotti\nwould not detain them over the complete catalogue. He would only tell\nthem that while others slept, while opulent German gentlemen dreamed\nabout portfolios, the hall-boy was busy, helping his cousin, the valet\nof the first floor, to brush the clothes of those who so magnificently\nrewarded the services rendered them. Inside and outside were those\nclothes brushed: not a speck of dust remained when the supporter of\nhis mother had done with them. They were turned inside and out, they\nwere shaken, they were brushed again, they were neatly folded. In this\nway, gentlemen, and in no other came the knowledge of the hole in the\npocket....\n\n_Dio mio!_ Who spoke of fireworks?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat evening Luigi came up to the villa to receive Francis's\ncongratulations on his acquittal and departed through the garden. Next\nmorning Francis, strolling about, came to the wall of the cistern,\nwhere Luigi's cache used to lurk behind the loosened masonry. The\ngarden-bed just below it looked as if it had been lately disturbed,\nand with a vague idea in his mind he began digging with his stick in\nit. Very soon he came upon some shredded fragments of leather buried\nthere.... I am rather afraid Francis is an accomplice.\n\n\n\n\nJUNE, 1914\n\n\nWe have had a month of the perfect weather, days and nights of flawless\nand crystalline brightness, with the sun marching serene all day across\nthe empty blue, and setting at evening unveiled by cloud or vapour\ninto the sea, and a light wind pouring steadily as a stream from the\nnorth. But one morning there gathered a cloud on the southern horizon\nno bigger than a man's hand, which the weather-wise say betokens a\nchange. On that day, too, there appeared in the paper that other cloud\nwhich presaged the wild tempest of blood and fire. Here in this secure\nsiren isle we hardly gave a thought to it. We just had it hot at\nlunch and cold at dinner, and after that we thought of it no more. It\nseemed to have disappeared, even as the column of smoke above Vesuvius\ndisappeared a few weeks ago.\n\nIt had been a very hot clear morning, and since, the evening before,\nit had been necessary to tell Pasqualino that the wages he received,\nthe food he ate, and the room he occupied were not given him gratis by\na beneficent Providence in order that he should have complete leisure\nto make himself smart and spend his whole time with his Caterina, he\nhad been very busy sweeping and embellishing the house, while it was\nstill scarcely light, in order to put into practice the fervency of\nhis reformed intentions. He had come into my bedroom while dawn was\nyet grey, on tiptoe, in order not to awaken me, and taken away the\nstep-ladder which he needed. As a matter of fact, I was already awake,\nand so his falling downstairs or throwing the step-ladder downstairs\na moment afterwards with a crash that would have roused the dead did\nnot annoy but only interested me, and I wondered what he wanted the\nstep-ladder for, and whether it was much broken. Soon the sound of\nmuffled hammering began from the dining-room below, which showed he was\nvery busy, and the beaming face with which he called me half an hour\nlater was further evidence of his delighted and approving conscience.\nIt was clear that he could hardly refrain from telling me what he\nhad been doing, but the desire to surprise and amaze me prevailed,\nand he went off again with a broad grin. Soon I came downstairs, and\ndiscovered that he had woven a great wreath of flowering myrtle, gay\nwith bows of red riband, and had nailed it up over the door into the\ndining-room. A cataract of whitewash and plaster had been dislodged\nin the fixing of it, which he was then very busy sweeping up, and\nhe radiantly told me that he had been on the hill-side at half-past\nfour to gather materials for his decoration. Certainly it looked very\npretty, and when the plaster and whitewash was cleared away, you could\nnot tell that any damage had been done to the fabric of the house. Soon\nafter Caterina came in with the week's washing balanced in a basket on\nher head, and Pasqualino took her through to show her his wreath. She\nhighly approved, and he kissed her in the passage. I may remark that\nshe is sixteen and he seventeen, so there is plenty of time for him\nto do a little work as domestic servant before he devotes himself to\nCaterina. Of all the young things in the island these two are far the\nfairest, and I have a great sympathy with Pasqualino when he neglects\nhis work and goes strutting before Caterina. But I intend that he shall\ndo his work all the same.\n\nThere is no such delicious hour in this sea-girt south as that of early\nmorning ushering in a hot day. The air is full of a warm freshness.\nThe vigour of sea and starlight has renewed it, and though for several\nweeks now no drop of rain has fallen, the earth has drunk and been\nrefreshed by the invisible waters of the air. The stucco path that\nruns along the southern face of the house, still shadowed by the\nstone-pine, glistened with heavy dews, and the morning-glory along the\ngarden walls, drenched with moisture, was unfolding a new galaxy of wet\ncrumpled blossoms. Yet in spite of the freshness of the early hour,\nthere was a certain hint of oppression in the air, and strolling along\nthe lower terrace, I saw the cloud of which I have spoken, already\nforming on the southern horizon. But it looked so small, so lost, in\nthe vast dome of blue that surrounded it, that I scarcely gave it a\nsecond thought.\n\nPresently afterwards Francis and I set out to walk down to the\nbathing-place. We stopped in the Piazza to order a cab to come down\nto the point where the road approaches nearest to the beach from which\nwe bathed, for the midday walk up again would clearly be intolerable\nin the heat that was growing greater every moment, and set out through\nnarrow ways between the vineyards, in order to avoid the dust of the\nhigh road. The light north wind, which for the past month had given\nvigour to the air, had altogether fallen, and not a breath disturbed\nthe polished surface of the bay, where twenty miles away Naples and\nthe hills above it were unwaveringly mirrored on the water. So clear\nwas it that you could see individual houses there, so still that the\nhair-like stalks of the campanulas which frothed out of the crevices\nof the walls stood stiff and motionless, as if made of steel. Above us\nthe terraced vineyards rose in tiers to the foot of the sheer cliffs\nof Monte Gennaro, fringed with yellow broom; below they stretched, in\nan unbroken staircase down to the roofs of the Marina, to which at\nmidday comes the steamer from Naples carrying our post and a horde of\ntourists who daily, for the space of three or four hours, invade the\nplace. Still downwards we went between vines and lemon orchards, and an\noccasional belt of olive-trees, till the bay opened before us again and\nthe flight of steps that led to the enchanted beach of the _Palazzo a\nmare_.\n\nHere on the edge of the sea the Emperor Tiberius built one of his seven\nisland palaces, but in the course of centuries this northern shore has\nsubsided, so that the great halls that once stood on the margin of the\nbay are partly submerged, and the waves wash up cubes of green and red\nmarble from tesselated pavements that once formed the floors of the\npalace. Portions of the cliff-side are faced with the brickwork of its\nwalls, from the fissures in which sprout spurge and tufts of valerian,\nand tumbled fragments of its foundations lie about on the beach and\nproject into the water, in lumps twenty feet thick of compounded stone\nand mortar. The modern historian has been busy lately with Tiberius,\ndevoting to his memory pailfuls of antiquarian whitewash, and here,\nwhere tradition says there lay the scene of infamous orgies, we are\ntold now to reconstruct a sort of Sunday-school presided over by an\naged and benevolent emperor, who, fatigued with affairs of state, found\nhere an innocent and rural retreat, where he could forget his purple,\nand refresh himself with the beauties of Nature. Whatever the truth\nof that may be, there is no doubt that he built this palace in a most\ndelectable place, and I sincerely hope that he was as happy in it as I\nam every morning among its ruins.\n\nAt one end of this little bay project huge masses of the palace walls,\nforming the promontory round which the fat and thwarted German swam,\nthe day that he brought Luigi down to carry his clothes and his towels\nand his shoes. These latter were to enable him to cross the shingly\nbeach, which, when the feet are unaccustomed to it, is undeniably\npainful. Along it, and by the edge of this tideless water, are pockets\nand streaks of grey sand, and to-day the sea lies as motionless as\nif it was the surface of some sheltered lake. Not a ripple disturbs\nit, not a breath of wind ruffles its surface. Standing knee-deep in\nit and looking down, you might think, but for a certain fullness and\nliquid clarity in the pebbles that lie at the bottom, that there was\nno water there at all, so closely does its translucence approach to\ninvisibility. But it is impossible to stand dry-skinned there for long,\nso hotly does the sun strike on the shoulders, and soon I fall forward\nin it, and lie submerged there like a log, looking subaqueously at the\nbright diaper of pebbles, with a muffled thunder of waters in my ears,\nlonging to have a hundred limbs in order to get fuller contact with\nthis gladdest and loveliest of all the creatures of God.\n\nBut even in this hedonistic bathing one's ridiculous mind makes tasks\nfor itself, and it has become an affair of duty with me to swim\nbackwards and forwards twice to a certain rock that lies some three\nhundred yards away. There (for Luigi is not alone in this island in\nthe matter of caches) I have what you may really call an emporium\nstowed away in a small seaweed-faced nook which I believe to be\nundiscoverable. If you know exactly where that nook is (it lies about\ntwo feet above the surface of the water), and put your hand through the\nseaweed at exactly the right spot, you will find a tin box containing\n(_i_) a box of matches, (_ii_) a handful of cigarettes, (_iii_) a\nthermometer. The first time that I arrive at the rock I have no truck\nwith my cache, but only touch the rock with a finger, and swim back\nto the beach again. There I touch another rock with my finger (these\ntwo rocks, in fact, are like the creases at cricket, which you must\ntouch with your bat in order to score a run), and swim back for the\nsecond time to my wicket out at sea. Then, oh then, after a cautious\nsurvey, in order to see that no one, not even Francis, can observe my\nmovements, I take the tin box from its place, get out of the water on\nto the rock, and having dried my fingers on wisps of seaweed, light\na cigarette and smoke it. As I smoke it, I submerge the thermometer\nin the sea, and when the cigarette is finished, read the temperature.\nAfter that the thermometer has to be dried, and is put back in the box\nwith the cigarettes and matches, and the treasure is stowed away again\nin its seaweed-fronted cave. Once a fortnight or so I must go through\na perilous manoeuvre, for I have to bring the box back to be refilled.\nThis entails swimming with one hand in the air holding the box like\nExcalibur above the sea, and it can only be done on very calm mornings,\nfor otherwise there is danger of some ripples intruding through the\nhinges or edge of the lid, which does not shut very well. And all the\ntime the risk of detection is imminent, for if Francis saw me swimming\nto land with a bright tin box in my hand, he would be certain to make\ninquires. But so far no such heartbreaking disaster has befallen, and\nwithout detection (and I humbly trust without suspicion) the cache-box\nhas been twice taken back to be refilled and gone on its return journey\nagain to its romantic hiding-place. Sometimes I have been within an\nace of discovery, as when, to my horror, two days ago Francis swam out\nto my rock, instead of going to his own, while I was in the middle of\nmy cigarette. I had time to put the box back, but somehow it never\noccurred to me to throw the cigarette away. By a special dispensation\nof Providence, however, it was not permitted that it should occur to\nhim as odd that I should be seated on a rock in the middle of the sea,\nsmoking. He was accustomed to the sight, I must suppose, of my smoking\non land, and the question of locality did not occur to him. But it\nseemed a weary, weary time before he slid off into the sea again, I\nairily remarking that I should sit there a little longer. Sometimes,\nwhen Francis has been unusually communicative about private matters\nthat concern himself alone, I wonder whether I ought to tell him about\nmy cache. But I don't, for those who understand the true science of\ncaches understand that if you have made a cache alone, you might just\nas well not have made it at all if you share your secret with anybody.\nYou can have joint caches, of course....\n\n      *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis morning the thermometer registered seventy-six degrees, which\ngave me a feeling of personal pride in the sea and Italy generally,\nand I swam lazily back through the warm clinging water. The sun flamed\noverhead, and the line of the beach was reeling and dancing in the\nheat. But if you think that now my bathe was over, you are miserably\nmistaken; you might as well suppose that the play of _Hamlet_ was\nfinished when the ghost appeared. The swim to the rock is only the\nfirst act, the main bathe; and now begins the second or basking act,\nwhich may or may not be studious.\n\nSome dozen bathers, English and American, for the most part, are dotted\nabout the beach. Francis is already out of the water, and is lying on\nhis back in a pocket of sand, with his hands across his eyes to keep\nthe glare out, and I take my volume of \"The Ring and the Book,\" which I\nhave made it my task to read through, put on a hat, and, wet and cool,\nsit down propped up against a smooth white rock. This is so hot that I\nmust needs hang a towel over it, and then I open my book where I last\nturned down the page. For ten minutes perhaps I am a model of industry,\nand then insensibly my eye wanders from the dazzling white page where\nthe words by some optical delusion seem printed in red....\n\nThe sea is still a mirror of crystal; some little way out a big\nsteamer, high in the water, so that the screw revolves in a smother\nof foam, is kicking her way into Naples, and soon the dark blue lines\nof her wash will come creaming to land. Otherwise nothing stirs; the\nsun-burned figures disposed about the beach might be asleep, and on the\nsteep hill-side behind there is no sound or movement of life. Perhaps\na little draught draws downward towards the sea, for mixed with the\naromatic smells of the dried seaweed on the beach there is a faint\nodour of the broom flower that flames on the slope. Already my book\nhas slipped from my knee on to the pebbles, and gradually--a phenomenon\nto which I am getting accustomed in these noonday baskings--thought\nfades also, and I am only conscious, though very vividly conscious; I\nknow vividly, acutely, that this is Italy, that here is the sea and the\nbaking beach, and the tumbled fragments of Tiberius's palace, that a\ndozen yards away Francis, having sat up, is clasping his knees with his\narms, and is looking seaward, but all these things are not objects of\nthought, but only of consciousness. They seem part of me, or I of them;\nthe welding of the world to me gets closer and more complete every\nmoment; I am so nearly _the same thing_ as the stones on the beach, and\nthe liquid rim of the sea; so nearly too, am I Francis, or, indeed,\nany other of these quiet dreaming basking figures. The line of the\nsteamer's wash which is now on the point of breaking along the shore\nis so nearly realizable as one with the sun or the sky, or me, or any\nvisible or tangible part of the whole, for each is the expression of\nthe Absolute....\n\nI do not know whether this is Paganism or Pantheism, or what, but that\nit is true seems beyond all power of doubt; it is certain, invariable,\nall that varies is our power of feeling it. To me personally the sense\nof home that Italy gives quickens my perception and assimilation\nof it, and this is further fulfilled by the intimacy with external\nthings produced by these sun-soaked and sea-pickled mornings. Here in\nthe south one gets closer to the simple facts of the world, one is\nwelded to sun and sea; the communications between soul and body and\nthe external world are cleaned and fortified. It is as if the buzz\nand clatter of a telephone suddenly cleared away, and the voice came\nthrough unhindered. In England the distraction and complications that\nnecessarily crowd in on one in the land where one lives and earns one's\nliving, and is responsible for a house and is making arrangements\nand fitting them into the hours of the day, choke the lines of\ncommunication; here I strip them off even as I strip off my clothes to\nwallow in the sea and lie in the sand. The barriers of individualism,\nin which are situated both the sense of identity, and the loneliness\nwhich the sense of _being oneself_ brings, are drawn up like the\nsluices of a lock, letting the pour of external things, of sun and sea\nand human beings into the quiet sundered pool. I begin to realize with\nexperience that I am part of the whole creation to which I belong.\n\nYou will find something of this consciousness in all that school of\nthought known as mysticism; it is, indeed, the basis of mysticism,\nwhether that mysticism is pagan or Christian. In Greek thought you will\nfind it, expressed guardedly and tentatively, and it undoubtedly lies\nat the base of some of their myths. It lurks in that myth of Narcissus,\nthe youth who, beholding his own fair image in tranquil water, was\ndrawn in by the spirits of the stream, and became a flower on the bank\nof the pool where he had lost himself, becoming merged in creation. So,\ntoo, in the story of Hyacinthus, whom Apollo loved. Him, as he was\nplaying with the discus, the sun-god inadvertently slew, and from his\nblood came up the flowers that bear his name. And more especially, for\nhere we get not the instance only but the statement of the idea itself,\nwe find it in the myth of Pan, the god of all Nature, the spirit of all\nthat is. He was not to be found in town or market-place, nor where men\ncongregate, but it might happen that the lonely wayfarer, as he passed\nthrough untenanted valley or over empty hill-side, might hear the sound\nof his magical fluting of the tune that has no beginning and no ending,\nfor it is as young as spring and as old as Time. He might even see him\nseated in some vine-wreathed cave, and though the sight of him meant,\neven as to Narcissus or to Hyacinthus, the death of the body, who shall\ndoubt that he to whom that vision was vouchsafed died because he had\nutterly fulfilled himself as an individual, and his passing was the\nbursting of his heart with the greatness of the joy that illuminated\nhim? He had beheld Nature--Nature itself with true eyes, and could no\nlonger exist in separate individual consciousness; seeing the spirit of\nthe All, he knew and was merged in his union with it.\n\nHere is the pagan view of the All-embracing, All-containing God, and it\nis hardly necessary to point out how completely it is parallel to, even\nidentical with, the revelations of Christian mysticism. The bridal of\nthe soul with her Lord, as known to St. Theresa, the dissolution and\nbathing of the soul in love, its forsaking of itself and going wholly\nfrom itself, which is the spirit of what Thomas \u00c3\u00a0 Kempis tells us of\nthe true way, are all expressions of the same spiritual attainment. To\nthem it came in the light of Christian revelation, but it was the same\nthing as the Greek was striving after in terms of Pan. And in every\nhuman soul is planted this seed of mystic knowledge, which grows fast\nor slow, according to the soil where it is set, and the cultivation\nit receives. To some the knowledge of it comes only in fitful faraway\nflashes; others live always in its light. And the consciousness of it\nmay come in a hundred manners: to the worshipper when he receives the\nmystery of his faith at the altar, to the lover when he beholds his\nbeloved, to the artist when the lift of cloud or the \"clear shining\nafter rain\" suddenly smites him personally and intimately, so that for\nthe moment he is no longer an observer but is part of what he sees.\n\nBut to none of us does the complete realization come until the time\nwhen our individuality, as known to us here and now, breaks like the\nfolded flower from the sheath of the body. Often we seem nearly to get\nthere; we feel that if only we could stay in a state of mind that is\npurely receptive and quiescent, the sense of it would come to us with\ncomplete comprehension. But as we get near it, some thought, like a\nbuzzing fly, stirs in our brain, and with a jerk we are brought back\nto normal consciousness, with the feeling that some noise has brought\nus back from a dream that was infinitely more vivid and truer than the\nworld we awake to.\n\nSo it happened to me now. I saw and heard the hissing of the wash of\nthe steamer break on the shore, observing it and thinking about it. I\nsaw, too, that Francis had got up and was walking along towards me,\nankle-deep in the shallow water. He groped among the pebbles with his\nhand, and picked something up. Then he came and lay down alongside, and\nbefore he spoke I think I knew the gist of what he was going to say.\n\nHe held out to me what he had picked up. It was one of those fragments\nof green mottled marble, such as we often find here, washed up from the\nruined pavements of the palace.\n\n\"What is it?\" he said. \"What is it really? God somehow, you know.\"\n\n\"Or you or me?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Yes, of course. Either, both. But there is something, Someone, call it\nthe Absolute or the First Cause or God, which is quite everywhere. It\ncan't be local. That's the only explanation of All-there-is which will\nhold water, and it holds water and everything else. But you don't get\nat it by discussion and arguments, or even by thought. You've got to\nopen the windows and doors; let the air in. Perhaps you've got to knock\ndown and blow up the very house of your identity, and sit on the ruins\nand wait. But it's the idea of that which makes me so busy in my lazy\nlife.\"\n\nThe ripple of the steamer's wash died away again.\n\n\"Funny that you should have said that just now,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Why? Just because you had been thinking about it? I don't see that. If\nthe wind blew here, it would be odder that it didn't blow when I was\nsitting over there.\"\n\n\"But did you know I had been thinking about it?\"\n\n\"Well, it seemed likely. Let's have another swim before we dress.\nThere's trouble coming in the sky. It's the last of the serene days for\nthe present.\"\n\n\"But there was a high barometer this morning.\"\n\n\"There won't be when we get up to the Villa again,\" he said. \"The sun\nhas got the central-heating touch to-day. It's been stuffy heat for the\nlast hour, not the heat of the fire. And look at the sky.\"\n\nCertainly a curious change had taken place all over the firmament. It\nwas as if some celestial painter had put body-colour into what had been\na wash of pure blue; there was a certain white opacity mingled with\nthe previous clarity of it. The sun itself, too, was a little veiled,\nand its heat, as Francis had said, seemed more like the radiation from\nhot-water pipes than the genial glow of an open fire. Round it at a\ndistance of three or four of its diameters ran a pale complete halo, as\nof mist. Yet what mist could live in such a burning and be unconsumed?\n\n  \"'Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines,\n    And often is his gold complexion dimmed,'\"\n\nquoted Francis. \"But here we have the two things occurring\nsimultaneously, which Shakespeare did not mean. But what, after all,\n_didn't_ Shakespeare mean?\"\n\nWe swam out round the fat German's promontory, floated, drifting with\nthe eastward setting current, came lazily in again, and even more\nlazily walked up through the narrow cobbled path to where the rickety\nlittle victoria was waiting for us on the road. The tourist boat had\narrived, and clouds of dust hung in the air, where their vehicles\nhad passed, undispersed by any breeze. The intolerable oppression of\nthe air was increasing every moment; the horse felt himself unable\nto evolve even the semblance of a trot, and the driver, usually the\nsmartest and most brisk of charioteers, sat huddled up on his box,\nwithout the energy to crack his whip or encourage his steed to a\nlivelier pace. Usually he sits upright and sideways, with bits of\nlocal news for his passengers, and greetings for his friends on the\nroad; to-day he had nothing beyond a grunt of salutation, and a shrug\nof the shoulders for the tip which he usually receives with a wave of\nhis hat, and a white-toothed \"_Tante grazie!_\" The Piazza, usually a\ncrowded cheerful sort of outdoor club at midday, was empty, but for a\nfew exhausted individuals who sat in the strips of narrow shadow, and\nthe post-office clerk just chucked our letters and papers at us. The\napproach of Scirocco, though as yet no wind stirred, made everyone\ncross and irritable, and set every nerve on edge, and from the kitchen,\nwhen we arrived at the Villa, we heard sounds of shrill altercation\ngoing on between Pasqualino and Seraphina, a thing portentously\nunusual with those amicable souls. Pasqualino banged down the macaroni\non the table, and spilt the wine and frowned and shrugged till Francis\ntold him abruptly to mend his manners or let Seraphina serve us; on\nwhich for a moment the sunny Italian child looked out from the clouds\nand begged pardon, and said it was not he but the cursed Scirocco. And\nthen, following on the cloud in the sky that had spread so quickly over\nthe heavens, came the second cloud.\n\nFrancis had just opened the Italian paper which we had got at the\npost-office and gave one glance at it.\n\n\"Horrible thing!\" he said. \"The Archduke Ferdinand, heir to the\nAustrian throne, and his wife have been murdered at Serajevo. Where is\nSerajevo? Pass the mustard, please.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPasqualino's myrtle wreath fell down during lunch (he told us that it\nhad done the same thing a good deal all morning), and he, exhausted by\nhis early rising to pick it, and the increasing tension of Scirocco,\nwent and lay down on the bench by the cistern in the garden as soon as\nhis ministrations were over, and after the fashion of Italians took off\nhis coat and put it over his head, which seemed odd on this broiling\nand airless day. From the kitchen came the choking reverberation of\nsnores, and looking in, I saw Seraphina reposing augustly on the floor,\nwith her back propped up against the kitchen dresser and her mouth\nwide, as if for presentation to a dentist. Francis retired to his\nbedroom to lie down and sleep, and, feeling like Oenone that \"I alone\nawake,\" I went to my sitting-room to read the paper, and, if possible,\nwrite a letter that ought to have been sent quite a week ago.\n\nThis room is furnished exactly as I chose to furnish it; consequently\nit has got exactly all that I want in it, and, what is even more\nimportant, it has nothing that I don't want. There is a vast table made\nof chestnut wood, so big that a week's arrears can accumulate on it,\nand yet leave space to write, to play picquet at the corner and to have\ntea. (If there are any other uses for a table, I don't know them.) This\ntable stands so that the light from the window number one falls on it,\nand close behind it along the wall is the spring mattress of a bed. On\nit lies another thick comfortable mattress; above that a stamped linen\ncoverlet, and on that are three enormous cushions and two little ones.\nThe debilitated author, therefore, when the fatigue of composition\ngrows to breaking-point, can thus slide from his chair at the enormous\ntable, and dispose the cushions so as to ensure a little repose.\nOpposite this couch stands a bookcase, where are those few works that\nare necessary to salvation, such as \"Wuthering Heights,\" \"Emma,\" and\n\"The Rub\u00c3\u00a1iy\u00c3\u00a1t,\" books that you can open anywhere and be instantly\nwafted, as on a magic carpet, to familiar scenes that never lose the\nchallenge of novelty (for this is the reason of a book, just as it is\nalso of a friend). After the bookcase comes the door into my bedroom,\nand after that, on the wall at right angles, window number two, looking\nsouth. A chair is set against the wall just beyond it, and beyond again\n(coming back to window number one, which looks west) another chair,\nbig, low and comfortable, convenient to which stands a small table, on\nwhich Pasqualino has placed a huge glass wine-flask, and has arranged\nin it the myrtle that was left over from his wreath. The walls of this\nabode of peace are whitewashed and ungarnished by pictures, the ceiling\nis vaulted, the tiled floor is uncarpeted, and outside window number\none is a small terrace, on the walls of which stand pots of scarlet\ngeraniums, where, when nights are too hot within, I drag a mattress, a\npillow and a sheet. There are electric lamps on both tables and above\nthe couch, and I know nothing that a mortal man can really want, which\nis not comprised in this brief catalogue.\n\nI wrote the letter that should have been written a week ago, found that\nit didn't meet the case, and after tearing it up, lay down on the couch\n(completely conscious of my own duplicity of purpose) in order, so I\nsaid to myself, to think it over. But my mind was all abroad, and I\nthought of a hundred other things instead, of the bathe, of the garden,\nand wondered whether if I went into the studio and played the piano\nvery softly, it would disturb anybody. Then I had the idea that there\nwas someone in the studio, and found myself listening as to whether I\nheard steps there or not. Certainly I heard no steps, but the sense\nthat there was someone there was rather marked. Then, simultaneously\nI remembered how both Pasqualino and Seraphina had heard steps there,\nwhen the house was otherwise empty, and had gone there, both singly and\ntogether, to see if Francis or I had come in. But even as I did now,\nthey have entered and found the studio empty. Often I have hoped that\na ghost might lurk in those unexplained footfalls, but apparently the\nghost cannot make itself more manifest than this.\n\nI stood there a moment still feeling that there was somebody there,\nthough I neither saw nor heard anything, and then went quietly along\nthe passage, under the spur of the restlessness that some people\nexperience before Scirocco bursts, and looked into Francis's room, the\ndoor of which was open. He lay on his bed in trousers and opened shirt,\nsleeping quietly. From here I could catch the sound of Seraphina's\nsnoring, and from the window could see the head-muffled Pasqualino\nspread out in the shade of the awning above the garden cistern. And\nfeeling more Oenone-ish than ever, I went back and lay down again. It\nwas impossible in this stillness and stagnation of the oppressed air to\ndo more than wait, as quiescently as possible, for the passing of the\nhours.\n\nI was not in the least sleepy, but I had hardly lain down when the\nmuddle and blur of sudden slumber began to steal over my brain. I\nthought I remembered seeing the murdered Archduke once in London, and\nwas I wrong in recollecting that he always wore a fur-tippet over\nhis mouth? I recognized that as nonsense, for I had never seen him at\nall, and fell to thinking about Francis lying there on his bed, with\ndoors and windows open. It seemed to me rather dangerous that he should\nlie there, relaxed and defenceless, for it was quite possible that\nMiss Machonochie, recognizing that everything was one (even as I had\nfelt this morning on the beach) might easily prove to be Artemis, and\ncoming in moon-wise through Francis's window might annex her Endymion.\nThis seemed quite sensible ... or Caterina might float into the garden\nin similar guise, and carry off Pasqualino ... perhaps both of these\nlove-disasters might happen, and then Seraphina and I alone would\nbe left.... I should certainly swim away to my _cache_, and live on\ncigarettes and seaweed, and mercury from the thermometer.... I should\nhave to break the bulb to get at it, and I thought that I was actually\ndoing so.\n\nIt broke with a terrific crash, which completely awoke me. Another\ncrash followed and a scream: it was the second shutter of my window\nthat faced south being blown against the sash, and the scream was that\nof the pent-up wind that burst with the suddenness of lightning out of\nthe sky. On the instant the house was full of noises, other shutters\nclattered and banged, my open door slammed to, as the Scirocco howled\nalong the passage, as if making a raid to search the house. My pile of\nunanswered businesses rose like a snowdrift from the table, and were\nlittered over the room; the wine flask and its myrtle overturned; a\npot of geraniums on the edge of the terrace came crashing down. In a\nmoment the whole stagnation of the world was rent to ribands, and the\nribands went flying on the wings of the wind. There was no doubt about\nfootsteps now: Pasqualino came rushing in from the garden, Seraphina\nleft her kitchen and bundled upstairs, and I collided with Francis as\nwe ran into the studio to close the windows. Never have I known so\nsurprising a pounce of the elemental forces of the world. A volcano\nbursting in flame and lava at one's feet, a war suddenly springing\nfull-armed in a peaceful country, could not have shattered stillness\nwith so unheralded an uproar.\n\nFive minutes served to bolt and bar the southern and western aspects\nof the house from the quarter of the gale, and five more to repair\nthe damage of its first assault. After that we listened with glee to\nits bellowing, and while Seraphina made tea, I went out of an eastern\nentrance to gain further acquaintance with this savage south-wester\nat first hand. It threw me back like a hot wave when I emerged from\nthe sheltered side of the house into its full blast, but soon, leaning\nagainst it, I crept across the garden to the lower terrace. The\nolive-trees were bending to it, as if some savage, invisible fish had\ntaken a bait they held out; twigs and branches were scurrying along\nthe paths, and mixed with them were the petals and the buds of flowers\nthat should have made July gay for us. A whirl of blue blossoms was\nsquibbing off the tangle of morning-glory; even the red pillar-trunk\nof the stone-pine groaned as the wind drove through its umbrella of\ndense foliage. The sun was quite hidden; only a pale discolourment\nin the sky showed where it travelled, and to the south the sea was\nalready a sheet of whipped wave-tops under this Niagara of wind. It was\nimpossible to stand there long, and soon I let myself be blown back\nup the garden and round the corner of the house into calm. Upstairs\nFrancis was already at tea; he had picked up the sheet of the Italian\npaper which he had only glanced at during lunch.\n\n\"Serajevo appears to be in Servia,\" he said, \"or Bosnia. One of those\ncountries.\"\n\n\"Oh, the murder!\" said I. \"The garden's in an awful mess.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. Tea?\"\n\n\n\n\nJULY, 1914\n\n\nFor the last seven weeks not a drop of rain has fallen on the island.\nThe great Scirocco of June brought none with it, and when that three\ndays' hurricane was over, we returned to the wonderful calm weather\nthat preceded it. Already nearly a month before the ordinary time the\ngrape clusters are beginning to grow tight-skinned on the vines, and\nwe expect an unprecedented vintage, for the Scirocco, though violent\nenough on the south of the island, did no damage to the northern\nslopes, where are the most of the vineyards. But the dearth of water\nis already becoming serious, for depending, as we do, on the cisterns\nwhere the rain is stored, it is full time that replenishment came to\ntheir ebbing surfaces. For the last fortnight, unable to spare water\nfor other than household purposes, we have been obliged to maroon the\ngarden, so to speak, on a desert island, and already many householders\nare buying water for purposes of ablution and cooking. Indeed, when,\nlast night, the sprightly Pasqualino announced that there was only\nhalf a metre of water left in the second cistern (the first one we\nimprovidently emptied in order to clean it), and that the Signori would\nhave to have their risotto and macaroni boiled in the wine-juice, of\nwhich there promised so remarkable a supply, Seraphina, who had come\nupstairs for orders, told him pretty roundly that if this was meant for\na joke, it was in the worst possible taste, for it was she who ordered\nthe wine, and was responsible for the lowness of the Signori's bills.\nUpon which Pasqualino sinuously retired with a deprecating smile,\nleaving Seraphina, flushed with victory, in possession of the field....\nIn fact the situation is so serious, she proceeded to tell us, that the\npriests have arranged that the silver image of San Costanzo is to-night\nto be taken in procession from the cathedral, where it usually abides,\ndown to the Marina, where an altar is to be set up for him close to the\nquay, and fireworks to be let off, so that he may be gratified and by\nmaking intercession cause the rain we so sorely need to fall.\n\nCertainly that seems a very sensible idea. The islanders adore\nfireworks and processions, and it is only reasonable of them to endow\ntheir saints with the same amiable tastes. San Costanzo, like all\nsensible folk, whether saints or sinners, delights in fireworks and\nprocessions, and of course he will be pleased to do his best after\nthat. (As a matter of fact, though I hate cynicism, I cannot help\nremembering that the barometer has been falling these last three days,\nand I wonder whether the priests who have arranged this _festa_ for San\nCostanzo know that. I hope not.)\n\nSeraphina's informant on these matters was not the priest, anyhow, but\nTeresa of the cake shop.\n\n\"And is Teresa then going down to the Marina?\" I asked.\n\nSeraphina threw open her hands and tossed back her head in emphatic\ndenial. The Signor surely knew very well (or if he did not, Signorino\nFrancesco did) that it was twelve years now since Teresa had gone down\nto the port, and never again would she set foot on that ill-omened\nquay. _La povera!..._ And Seraphina stood in silence a moment, gravely\nshaking her head. Then she threw off the melancholy train of thought\ninto which the mention of Teresa had led her.\n\n\"The meat comes from Naples to-morrow,\" she announced. \"For dinner then\na piece of roast meat and the fish that Nino has promised and a soup of\nvegetables. _Ecco!_ And there will be no cooking in wine as that scamp\nsaid.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfterwards Francis told me why Teresa of the cake shop never goes down\nto the Marina, though _festas_ and fireworks beckon, and though San\nCostanzo's silver image is borne there in solemn procession, so that he\nmay intercede for us, and cause to break up the brazen sky. It filled\nup in the telling the studious or basking stage of our bathe next\nmorning.\n\n\"Fifteen years ago,\" he said, \"when first I came to the enchanted\nisland, Teresa Stali was the prettiest maid and the daintiest cook in\nall Alatri. That year I took for six months the Villa Bardi, which\nbelonged to her father, who told me that if I was in need of a cook he\ncould supply me with one of whom I should have no complaints. So, if I\nhad not already got one, Teresa would do everything I needed--cook my\nfood, look after the garden, and keep the house as bright as a Sunday\nbrooch. Teresa, he explained, was his daughter, a good girl, and would\nI interview her. In answer to his loud cries of 'Teresa! Teresina!'\ntaken up by shrill voices along the street, there came to the door a\nvision of tall black-haired maidenhood.\n\n\"'She is strong, too,' said her grinning parent, clapping her on the\nshoulder. 'Eh, the Signor should have seen her bump the heads of\nher two brothers together last week, when they threw stones at the\nwashing she had hung up to dry. Bang! bang! they will not meddle with\nTeresina's washing again!'\n\n\"Of course I engaged this paragon, and never has a house been so\nresplendent, never were such meals offered for the refreshment of\nthe esurient sons of men, as when Teresa was Prime Minister in the\nVilla Bardi. She was scarcely capable, it seemed, of walking, for her\nnimble feet broke into a run whenever more than a yard or two must\nbe traversed; household work was a festival to her, and she sang as\nshe emptied slops. Flowers, fresh every day, decked my table; you\ncould have eaten off the floors, and each morning my shoes shone with\nspeckless whitening. One thing alone had power to depress her, and that\nif by chance I went out to dine with friends, so that there was no\nopportunity that evening for her kitchen-magic. The antidote was that\non another day someone would dine with me, so that others beside her\nown signor should taste the perfect fruits of her oven.\n\n\"Often, when the table was cleared in the evening, and she came to\nget orders for next day before going back to her father's house for\nthe night, she would stop and talk to me, for, in that she was in my\nhousehold, she was of my family, identified with my interests and I\nwith hers. By degrees I learned her domestic history, how there was a\nbrother doing his military service, how there were two younger boys\nstill at home, whom Satan continually inspired to unspeakable deeds (of\nwhich the stoning of her washing was among the milder); how her mother\nhad taught her all she knew of cooking, how her father was the best\ncarpenter in all South Italy, so that he had orders from Naples, from\nSalerno, from Rome even. And, finally, she told me about herself, how\nthat she was engaged to Vincenzo Rhombo, of Santa Agatha, who had gone\nto Buenos Ayres to seek his fortune, and was finding it, too, with both\nhands. He had been gone for two years now, and last year he had sent\nher seven hundred francs to keep for him. Every year he was going to\nsend her all he saved, and when he came home, Dio!...\n\n\"The post used to arrive about half-past eight in the morning, and was\nannounced by sepulchral knocking on the garden door, on which Teresa,\nif she was brushing and tidying upstairs, flew down to take in the\nletters, duster in hand, or with whatever occupied her busy fingers at\nthe moment. From there she rushed along the garden terrace to where\nI was breakfasting underneath the pergola, bringing me my letters.\nBut one morning, I saw her take them in, and instead of coming to me,\nshe sat down on the steps and remained there a long time, reading.\nEventually I called to her.\n\n\"'Nothing for me, Teresa?' I asked.\n\n\"Instantly she sprang up.\n\n\"'Pardon--a thousand pardons,' she said. 'There are two letters, and a\npacket, a great packet.'\n\n\"'And you have had a packet?' I asked.\n\n\"'Jesu! Such a packet! May I show the Signor? Look, here is Vincenzo,\nhis very self! And again seven hundred francs. Ah, it _is_ Vincenzo! I\ncan hear him laughing.'\n\n\"She laid the photograph before me, and, indeed, you could hear\nVincenzo laughing. The merry handsome face was thrown back, with mouth\nhalf open.\n\n\"'And such news!' she said. 'He has done better than ever this year,\nand has bought a piece of land, or he would have sent even more money\nhome. And at the end----' she turned over the sheets, 'at the end he\nwrites in English, which he is learning. What does it mean, Signor?'\n\n\"This is what Vincenzo had written:\n\n\"'My corrospondence must now stopp, my Teresina, but never stopps my\nlove for you. Across the sea come my kisses, O my Teresina, and from\nthe Heart of your Vincenzo. I kiss my corrospondence, and I put it in\nthe envelop.'\n\n\"I translated this and turned to the dim-eyed Teresina.\n\n\"'And that is better than all the money,' she said.\n\n\"Then she became suddenly conscious that she was carrying my trousers,\nwhich she was brushing when the knock of the postman came.\n\n\"'Dio! What a slut is Teresina!' she exclaimed. 'Scusi, Signor.'\n\n\"I went back to England at the termination of my lease of the Villa\nBardi, for interviews with stormy uncles, and the settlement of many\nbusinesses, and it was some months later that I set off on my return\nhere, with finality in my movements. On the way I had intended to stop\nhalf a week in Naples to take my last draught of European culture. But\nthe sight of Alatri on the evening I arrived there, harp-shaped and\nswimming molten in a June sunset, proved too potent a magnet. Besides,\nthere was reputed to be a great deal of cholera in Naples, and I have\nno use for cholera. So, early next morning I embarked at the Castello\nd'Ovo to come back to my beloved island.\n\n\"It was a morning made for such islanders as I: the heat was\nintense but lively, and the first thing to do on landing was to\n'Mediterranizer' myself, as Nietzsche says, and bathe, wash off the\nstain of the mainland and of civilization, and be baptized, finally\nbaptized, into this dreamland life. I often wonder whether dreams----\"\n\n\"Stick to your story,\" said I. \"It's about Teresa.\"\n\nFrancis shifted on his elbow.\n\n\"There was a bucketful of changes here,\" he said, \"and I was\ndisconcerted, because I expected to find everything exactly as I had\nleft it. Alatri is the sleeping-beauty--isn't it true?--and the years\npass, and you expect to see her exactly as she was in the nineties.\nBut now they were talking of a funicular railway to connect the Marina\nwith the town, and Giovanni the boatman had married, and they said his\nwife had already cured him of his habits. Oh, she brushed his hair for\nhim, she did! And a damned American had started a lending library, and\nwe were all going to enlarge our minds on a circulating system, and\nthere was a bathing establishment planned, where on Sunday afternoon\nyou could drink your sirop to the sound of a band, and see the sluts\nfrom Naples. But it fell into the sea all right, and the posts of it\nare covered with barnacles. Far more important it was that Teresa had\nopened a cake-shop in a superb position, as you know, close to the\nPiazza, so that when you come in from your walk you cannot help buying\na cake: the force of its suggestion is irresistible. She opened it with\ngood money, too, the money that Vincenzo had sent her back from Buenos\nAyres. The cake-shop was now proceeding famously, and it was believed\nthat Teresa was making twenty per cent. on her outlay, which is as much\nas you can hope to get with safety. But it had been--the cake-shop--a\nprodigious risk; for a month when the island was empty it had not\nprospered, and Teresa's family distended their poor stomachs nightly\nwith the cakes that were left unsold that day, for Teresa had high\nideas, and would have nothing stale in her shop. She brought the unsold\nthings home every night in a bag, for fresh every morning must be her\ncakes, and so the family ate the old ones and saved the money for their\nsupper. Rich they were, many of them, and stuffed with cream.\n\n\"But after an anxious four weeks the _forestieri_ began to arrive,\nand under their patronage, up went Teresa's cake-shop like a rocket.\nCustomers increased and jostled; and Teresa, the daring, the audacious,\ntook good luck on the wing, and started a tea-place on the balcony\nabove the cake-shop, and bought four iron-legged, marble-topped\ntea-tables, and linen napkins, no less. She washed these incessantly,\nfor her tea-place was always full, and Teresa would no more have dirty\nnapkins than she would have stale cakes. That is Teresa!\n\n\"Business expanded. One of the two young brothers (whose heads she so\nsoundingly knocked together) she now employed in the baking of her\ncakes, and for the other she bought, straight off, a suit of white\ndrill with ten thousand bone buttons, and gave him employment in\nbringing the tea-trays up to the customers in the balcony. She paid\nthem both good wages, but Satan, as usual, entered into their malicious\nheads, and once in the height of the season they confabulated, and\nthought themselves indispensable, and struck for higher wages. Else\nthey would no longer bake or hand the bakeries.\n\n\"A less supreme spirit than Teresa's might have given in, and raised\ntheir wages. Instead she hurried their departure, and no whit\ndiscouraged, she rose at four in the morning, and baked, and when\nafternoon came had all ready, and flew upstairs and downstairs, and\nnever was there so good a tea as at Teresa's, nor so quickly served.\nIn three days she had broken the fraternal strike, and the baffled\nbrothers begged to be taken back. Then Teresa, who had been too busy\nto attend to them before, for she was doing their work in addition to\nher own, condescended to them, and told them what she really thought of\nthem. She sat in a chair, did Teresa, and loosed her tongue. There was\na blistering of paint that day on the balcony, though some said it was\nonly the sun which had caused it....\n\n\"Two sad-faced males returned to their work next day, at a stipend\nof five francs per month less than they had hitherto received. The\nisland, which had watched the crisis with the intensest interest,\nloudly applauded her spirit, and told the discouraged but repentant\nlabour-party that only a good-hearted sister would have taken them back\nat all. She had not even smacked them, which she was perfectly capable\nof doing, in spite of their increasing inches, but perhaps her tongue\nwas even more stinging than the flat of her hand. Great was Teresa of\nthe cake-shop!\n\n\"All this I heard, and the best news of all remained to tell, for\nVincenzo was even now on his way back from Buenos Ayres. He had made\na tremendous hit with the land he had bought last summer, had money\nenough to pay off the mortgages on his father's farm at Santa Agatha,\nand he and Teresa would marry at once. Then, alas! Alatri would know\nTeresa no more, for she would live with her husband on the mainland.\nAlready she had been made a very decent offer for the appurtenances\nand goodwill of the cake-shop, which, so she told me, she was secretly\ninclined to accept. But according to the proper ritual of bargaining,\nshe had, of course, refused it, and told Giorgio Stofa that when he had\na sensible proposition to make to her, he might call again. Giorgio, a\nmean man by all accounts, had been seen going to the bank that morning,\nand Teresa expected him to call again very soon.\n\n\"This conversation took place in the cake-shop while all the time she\nbustled about, now diving into the bake-house to stimulate the industry\nof Giovanni, now flying up to the balcony to see if Satan's other limb\nhad put flowers on the marble-topped tables. Then, for a moment there\nwas peace, and love looked out of Teresa's eyes.\n\n\"'Eh, Signor,' she said. 'Vincenzo will be home, if God wills, by the\nday of Corpus Domini. What a _festa! Dio!_ What a _festa_ will that be!'\n\n\"The serene island days began to unroll themselves again, with long\nswimmings, long baskings on the beach, long siestas on grilling\nafternoons, when the whole island lay mute till the evening coolness\nbegan, and only the cicalas chirped in the oleanders. Then, as the heat\nof the day declined, I would often have tea on Teresa's balcony, and\non one such afternoon the great news came, and Teresa put into my hand\nthe telegram she had just received from Naples, which told her that\nVincenzo's ship had arrived, and that her lover had come back. Business\nnecessary to transact would detain him there for a day, and for another\nday he must be at Santa Agatha, but on the morning of Corpus Domini he\nwould come to Alatri, by the steamer that arrived at noon....\n\n\"'Six years since he went,' said Teresa. 'And oh, Signor, it is but as\na day. We shall keep the _festa_ together and see the fireworks.... We\nshall go up into the rockets,' she cried in a sudden kindling of her\ntongue. 'We shall be golden rain, Vincenzo and I.'\n\n\"'And I shall stand below, oh, so far below,' said I, 'and clap my\nhands, and say \"Eccoli!\" That is, if I approve of Vincenzo.'\n\n\"Teresa put her hands together.\n\n\"'Eh! but will Vincenzo approve of me?' she said. 'Will he think I have\ngrown old? Six years! Oh, a long time.'\n\n\"'It is to be hoped that Vincenzo will not be a pumpkin,' I remarked.\n'Give me the large sort of cake, Teresa. I will carry it up to the\nVilla.'\n\n\"Teresa frowned.\n\n\"'The cakes are a little heavy to-day,' she said. 'I had a careless\nhand. You had better take two small ones, and if you do not like them,\nyou will send back the second. _Grazie tante, Signor._'\n\n\"The news that Vincenzo was to arrive by the midday boat on Corpus\nDomini, spread through the town, and all Teresa's family and friends\nwere down at the Marina to give him welcome. A heavy boat-load of\nvisitors was expected, and the little pier was cleared of loungers,\nso that the disembarkation in small boats from the steamer might, be\nunimpeded. But by special permission Teresa was given access to the\nlanding-steps, so that she might be the first to meet her lover, even\nas he set foot on the shore, and there, bare-headed and twinkling with\nall her _festa_ finery, she waited for him. In the first boat-load that\nput off from the steamer he came, standing in the prow, and waving to\nher, while she stood with clasped hands and her heart eager with love.\nHe was the first to spring ashore, leaping across to the steps before\nthe boat had come alongside, and with a great cry, jubilant and young,\nhe caught Teresa to him, and for a supreme moment they stood there,\nclasped in each other's arms. And then he seemed to fall from her and\ncollapsed suddenly on the quay, and lay there writhing.... The cholera\nthat was prevalent in Naples had him in his grip, and in two hours he\nwas dead....\"\n\nFrancis sat silent a little after the end of his story.\n\n\"So now you know,\" he said, \"why for fourteen years Teresa of the\ncake-shop has never gone down to the Marina.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night, when the thud and reverberation of the fireworks began down\non the Marina, Francis and I went into the town to see them from above.\nThe Piazza was deserted, for all Alatri had gone down to the port to\ntake part in this procession and explosion in honour of San Costanzo,\nso that he might make intercession and send rain to the parched island,\nand we went out on to the broad paved platform which overlooks the\nMarina. This, too, seemed to be deserted, and perched on the railing\nthat surrounds it, we watched the golden streaks of the ascending\nrockets, and their flowering into many-coloured fires. At this distance\nthe reports reached the ear some seconds after their burstings; their\nplumes of flame had vanished before their echoes flapped in the cliffs\nof Monte Gennaro. The moon was not yet risen, and their splendour\nburned brilliantly against the dark background of the star-sown sky.\nBy and by a whole sheaf of them went up together, and afterwards a\ndetonating bomb showed that the exhibition was over. And then we saw\nthat we were not alone, for in the dark at the far end of the railings\na black figure was watching. She turned and came towards us, and I saw\nwho it was.\n\n\"You have been looking at the fireworks, Teresa?\" said Francis.\n\n\"_Sissignor._ They have been very good. San Costanzo should send us\nrain after that. But who knows? It is God's will, after all.\"\n\n\"Surely. And how goes it?\"\n\nShe smiled at him with that sweet patient face, out of which fourteen\nyears ago all joy and fire died.\n\n\"The cake-shop?\" she said. \"Oh, it prospers. It always prospers. I am\ntrying a new recipe to-morrow--a meringue.\"\n\n\"And you--you yourself?\" he asked.\n\n\"I? I am always well. But often I am tired of waiting. _Pazienza!_\nShall I send some of the new meringues up to the Villa, if they turn\nout well, Signor?\"\n\nFrancis had an inexplicable longing that evening to play chess, and\nas he despises the sort of chess I play with the same completeness\nas I despise parsnips, I left him with someone less contemptible at\nthe caf\u00c3\u00a9, and strolled up to the Villa again alone, going along the\npaved way that overlooks the sea to the south. High up was hung an\namazing planet, and I felt rather glad I was no astronomer, and knew\nnot which it was, for the noblest of names would have been unworthy\nof that celestial jewel. As if it had been a moon, the reflection of\nits splendour made a golden path across the sea, and posturing in its\nlight, I found that it actually cast a vague shadow of me against a\nwhitewashed wall. To the east the rim of the hill, where is situated\nthe wireless station, was beginning to stand out very black against a\ndove-coloured sky, and before I had reached the steep steps that lead\npast the garden wall, the rim of the full moon had cut the hill-top,\ndimming the stars around it, and swiftly ascending, a golden bubble\nin the waters of the firmament, it had shot up clear of the horizon\nand refashioned the world again in ivory and black. All the gamut of\ncolours was dipped anew; blues were translated into a velvety grey,\nso too were greens, and though the eye could see the difference, it\nwas impossible to say what the difference was. Simply what we call\nblue by daylight became some kind of grey; what we call green a\ntotally distinct kind of grey and blacker than the darkest shadow of\nthe stone-pine was the shouting scarlet of the geraniums. No painter\n(pace the Whistlerians) has ever so faintly suggested the magic of\nmoon-colouring, and small blame to him, since the tone of it cannot be\nrendered in pictures that are seen in the daylight. But if you take the\npicture of a sunny day, and look at it in moonlight, you will see, not\na daylight picture, but a moonlight scene. The same thing holds with\ndaylight scents and night-scents, and the fragrance of the verbena by\nthe house wall was not only dimmer in quality, but different in tone.\nIt was recognizable but different, ghost-like, disembodied without the\nsmack of the sun in it.\n\nI strolled about for a little, and then having (as usual) writing\non hand that should have been done days before, I went reluctantly\ninto the house. I was quite alone in it, for Seraphina had gone home,\nPasqualino was down at the Marina taking part in fireworks and\n_festa,_ and I had left Francis in a stuffy caf\u00c3\u00a9 pondering on gambits.\nWe had dined early by reason of the fireworks, and before going up to\nmy sitting-room to work, I foraged for cake and wine in the kitchen,\nand carried these upstairs. It was very hot, and I went first into the\nstudio, where I set the windows wide, and next into Francis's room and\nPasqualino's, where I did the same. Then I came back to my own room,\nexactly opposite the studio, and, stripped to shirt and trousers, with\ndoor and windows wide, I sat down for an hour's writing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is no such incentive to constructive thought as the knowledge\nthat, humanly speaking, interruption is impossible. Seraphina would\nnot return till morning, while _festa_ and chess would undoubtedly\ndetain Pasqualino and Francis for the next couple of hours. I had a\nluxurious sense of security; should I be so fortunate as to strike\nthe vein I was delving for, I could go on mining there without let\nor hindrance. Reluctant though I had been to begin, I speedily found\nmyself delightfully engrossed in what I was doing. Probably it did not\namount to much, but the illusion in the author's mind, when he tinkers\naway at his tale, that he is doing something vastly important, is one\nthat is never shaken, even though he continually finds out afterwards\nthat the masterpiece has missed fire again. While he is engaged on his\nscribbling (given that his pen is in an interpreting frame of mind,\nand records without too many stumblings the dictation his brain gives\nit), he is in that Jerusalem that opens its gates of pearl only to\nthe would-be artist, be he painter or poet or writer or sculptor. He\nis constructing, recording his impressions, and though (I hasten to\nrepeat) they may be totally unworthy of record, he doesn't think so\nwhen he is engaged on them, for if he did, he would be conscious of\nexternal affairs, his mind would wander, and he would stop. Often, of\ncourse, that happens, but there are other blessed occasions when he is\nengulfed by his own imaginings, and absorbed in the reproduction of\nthem.\n\nIt was so with me that night, when I sat quite alone in the silent\nhouse, knowing that none could disturb me for a couple of hours to\ncome. Italy, even the fact that I was in Italy, vanished from my mind,\nand for the sake of the curious, at the risk of egoism, I may mention\nthat I was with Mrs. Hancock in her bedroom in her horrid villa called\nArundel, and looking over her jewels with her, to see what she could\nspare, without missing it, as a wedding present for her daughter.\nEngaged in that trivial pursuit, I lost conscious touch with everything\nelse.\n\nQuite suddenly a very ordinary noise, though as startling as the\nringing of a telephone-bell at my elbow, where there was no telephone,\nsnatched me away from my imaginings. There was a step in the studio\njust opposite, and I made no doubt that Francis had got home, had come\nupstairs without my hearing him, and no doubt thinking that I was at\nwork, had passed into the studio. But then, looking at my watch, which\nlay on the table before me, I saw that it was still only half-past\nten, and that I had been at work (and he at chess) for barely half an\nhour. But there was no reason that I should not go on working for an\nhour yet, and though my sense of security from interruption was gone,\nI anchored myself to my page again. But something had snapped; I could\nnot get back into Mrs. Hancock's bedroom again, and after a few feeble\nsentences, and a corresponding number of impatient erasures, I came to\na full stop.\n\nI sat there for some ten minutes more, vainly endeavouring to\nconcentrate again over Mrs. Hancock's jewels, but Francis's steps were\nin some way strangely disturbing. They passed up the studio, paused\nand returned, and paused and passed up again. Then, but not till then,\nthere came into my mind the fact that Seraphina and Pasqualino had at\ndifferent times heard (or thought they heard) footsteps in the studio,\nand on investigation had found it empty, and I began to wonder, still\nrather dimly and remotely, whether these were indeed the pacings of\nFrancis up and down the room. My reasonable mind told me that they\nwere, but the recollection of those other occasions became momently\nmore vivid, and I got up to see.\n\nThe door of my room and that of the studio were exactly opposite each\nother, with the width of a narrow passage between them. Both doors\nwere open, and on going into the passage I saw that the studio was\ndark within. It seemed odd that Francis should walk up and down, as he\nwas still continuing to do, in the dark.\n\nI suddenly felt an intense curiosity to know whether this was Francis\nwalking up and down in the dark, or rather an intense desire to satisfy\nmyself that it was not. The switch of the electric light was just\ninside the door, and even as my hand fumbled for it I still heard the\nsteps quite close to me. Next moment the studio leaped into light as I\npressed the switch, and I looked eagerly up and down it. There was no\none there, though half a second before I had heard the footsteps quite\nclose to me.\n\nI stood there a moment, not conscious of fear, though I knew that\nfor some reason my heart was creaking in my throat, and that I felt\nan odd prickly sensation on my head. But my paramount feeling was\ncuriosity as to who or what it was that went walking here, my paramount\nconsciousness that, though I could see no one, and the steps had\nceased, there was someone close to me all the time, watching me not\nunkindly. But beyond doubt, for all visible presence, the studio was\nempty, and I knew that the search which I now carried out, visiting the\ndarker corners, and going on to the balcony outside, from which there\nwas no external communication further, was all in vain. Whatever it was\nthat I, like Pasqualino and Seraphina, had heard, it was not a thing\nthat hid itself. It was there, waiting for us to perceive it, waiting\nfor the withdrawal of the shutter that separates the unseen world from\nthe seen. The shutter had been partly withdrawn, for I had heard it; I\nhad also the strong sense of its presence. But I had no conception as\nto what it was, except that I felt it was no evil or malignant thing.\n\nI went back to my room, and, oddly enough, directly after so curious\nan experience, I found myself able to concentrate on Mrs. Hancock\nagain without the slightest difficulty, and spent an absorbed hour.\nThen I heard the garden gate open, there were steps on the stairs, and\na moment afterwards Francis came up. I told him what had happened,\nexactly as I have set it down. He asked a few slightly scornful\nquestions, and then proceeded to tell me how he had lost his king's\nbishop. I could not ask scornful questions about that, but it seemed\nvery careless of him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe very next morning there turned up information which seems to\nmy mind (a mind which Francis occasionally describes as credulous)\nto bear upon the watcher and walker in the studio, and it happened\nin this wise. Ten days before, the careful Seraphina had collected\ncertain table-cloths, sheets and socks that needed darning, and with a\nview to having them thoroughly well done, and with, I make no doubt,\nanother motive as well in her superstitious mind, had given the job to\nDonna Margherita, a very ancient lady, but nimble with her needle,\nto whom we are all very polite. Even Francis (though he has admirable\nmanners with everybody) goes out of his way to be civil to Donna\nMargherita, and no one, who is at all prudent, will fail to give her\na \"Good day\" if he passes her in the street. But if the wayfarer sees\nDonna Margherita coming in his direction, and thinks she has not yet\nseen him, he will, if he is prudent, turn round and walk in another\ndirection. I have known Francis to do that on some paltry excuse (and\nhe says I have a credulous mind!), but his real reason is that though\nhe would not admit it, he is aware that Donna Margherita has the evil\neye. Consequently we islanders must not vex her or be other than\nscrupulously civil to her, though we keep out of her way if we can,\nand when we must pass her it is wise to make the sign of the Cross\nsurreptitiously. We do not talk about her much, for it is as well not\nto get near the confines of dangerous things; but before now Pasqualino\nhas told me of various occurrences which to his mind put it beyond all\ndoubt that Donna Margherita has the _jettatura._ There was the affair\nof his uncle's fig-tree: he had been foolish and said sharp things to\nher because her goat strayed into his vineyard. And Donna Margherita\njust looked at the fig-tree which grows by his gate, and said: \"You\nhave a fine fig-tree there; there will be plenty of fruit this summer.\"\nWithin a fortnight all the crop of little half-ripe figs dropped off.\nThere was her landlord who threatened to turn her out unless her\nquarter's overdue rent was paid the same evening. Was it paid? Not\na bit of it; but the very same day the landlord's kitchen roof fell\nin.... There is no end to such evidence, and so when ten days ago Donna\nMargherita asked Seraphina if there was not any mending for her to do,\nit is no wonder (especially since she is so neat with her needle) that\nSeraphina gave her our lacerated linen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch is the history of Donna Margherita, and so when this morning,\nas we were breakfasting, her knock came at the garden door, and she\nentered, Francis jumped up, and called Seraphina from the kitchen to\npay for the mending and give Donna Margherita a glass of wine on this\nhot morning. It was cool and shady under the pergola where we were\nbreakfasting, and as the old lady had a fancy to sit down for a little\nafter her walk, she came along and sat down with us. And, vying with\neach other in courtesies, Pasqualino brought her a slice of cake, and\nSeraphina a glass of wine, and then hastily retired from the dangerous\nneighbourhood, and looked out on the interview with troubled faces from\nan upper window.\n\nTo judge by her dried-apple cheek, and her gnarled and knotted hands,\nDonna Margherita might almost number the years with which Alatri\ncredits her, asserting that she is a hundred summers old. Eighty, at\nany rate, she must be, since she has good recollection of the events of\nmore than seventy years ago, and as she sipped her wine and clinked\nthe soldi Seraphina (grossly overpaying) had given her, she talked\namiably enough about our house and her early memories of it.\n\n\"Yes, it's a fine villa that the Signori have,\" she said; \"but I can\nremember it as but a farm-house before additions were made to it. The\nfarm buildings used to lean against it on the north, where later the\nbig room was built by the English artist; byre and cow-house were\nthere, and when I was a little girl a strange thing happened.\"\n\nShe mumbled her cake a little in her toothless jaws and proceeded:\n\n\"The farm in those days belonged to Giovanni Stofa, long since dead,\nand there he lived alone with his son, who is long dead also. One night\nafter the house was shut up, and they sat together before going to bed,\nthere came a noise and a clatter from the cow-house, very curious to\nhear. Giovanni thought that one of the cows had convulsions and ran out\nof the house and round by the kitchen, and into the shed where the two\ncows were stabled. And as he opened the door he was near knocked down,\nfor both of them ran out with hoofs in the air and tails switching.\nThen, not knowing what should meet his eyes, he turned the lantern that\nhe carried into the cow-house, and there standing in the middle was a\n_strega_ (witch). But she looked at him not unkindly, and said: 'I have\ncome to guard the house, and from henceforth I shall always guard it,\nwalking up and down, ever walking up and down.'\n\n\"The _strega_ smiled at him as she spoke, and his knees ceased to\ntremble, for this was no black visitant.\n\n\"'Your cattle will not be frightened again,' she said. 'Look, even now\nthey come back.'\n\n\"As she spoke, first one and then the other of the cows came into the\nstable again, and walked right up to where the _strega_ stood, blowing\nhard through their nostrils. And next moment they lay down close to\nher, one on each side.\n\n\"'You will often hear me walking about here,' said the _strega;_ 'but\nhave no fear, for I guard the house.'\n\n\"And with that there came just one puff of wind, and Giovanni's lantern\nflickered, and lo! when the flame was steady again there was no\n_strega_ there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDonna Margherita took a sip of wine after her recitation.\n\n\"And does she still walk up and down where the cow-house was?\" I asked.\n\n\"Surely; but fat ears cannot hear even the thunder,\" quoted Donna\nMargherita. \"And now, Signori, I will be walking. And thanks for the\nsoldi and the cake and the wine.\"\n\nFrancis got up too.\n\n\"You are active still, Donna Margherita,\" he said.\n\nDonna Margherita stepped briskly down the path.\n\n\"Eh, yes, Signor,\" she said. \"I am old but active; I can still do such\na day's work as would surprise you.\"\n\nFrancis's eye and mine met; we were behind her, so that she could not\nsee the exchanged glance. What was in both our minds was the affair of\nPasqualino's uncle's fig-tree, for that had certainly been a surprising\nday's work. But after she had gone, he alluded again to the steps I\nhad heard in the studio in a far more respectful manner. The fact is,\nso I made bold to tell him, that he does not like Donna Margherita's\nunconscious innuendo that he has fat ears.\n\nThe hot, serene days pursued their relentless course without our\nexperiencing any of the watery benefits we had hoped for from the treat\nof fireworks that we had given to San Costanzo, for immediately after\nthat improvised _festa_ the falling barometer retraced its downward\nsteps, and the needle stood, steady as if it had been painted there, on\nthe \"V\" of \"Very Dry.\" Miss Machonochie's cistern, so she informed us,\nhad barely a foot of water in it, and she came up to ask if she might\nborrow a few pailfuls from ours of a morning. \"Borrow\" was good, since\nnaturally she could not pay it back till the rain came and replenished\nher store, and the moment the rain came it would be a foolish thing\nto go carrying pailfuls of water from one house to another when all\nwere plentifully supplied. But she made a great point of putting down\nexactly how many pailfuls she borrowed, and also made a great point of\ncoming to thank Francis every other afternoon about tea-time for his\nkindness. She did not care about thanking me, though I had been just as\nkind as Francis, and eventually, owing to the awful frequency of these\nvisits, we posted Pasqualino on the balcony overlooking the path to\ngive warning (like Brang\u00c3\u00a4ene from her tower) of Miss Machonochie's fell\napproach, while we had tea, so that we could effect an exit through\nthe kitchen door, and live, like outlaws, in the heather, till Miss\nMachonochie had left her gratitude behind her. It was not sufficient to\ninstruct Pasqualino to say we were out, for then Miss Machonochie would\nsit and rest in the garden for a little, or come up to the studio to\nwrite a letter of thanks (always to Francis). But with Pasqualino on\nthe balcony, we can sit in peace over tea, till with a broad grin that\noccasionally explodes into laughter, he comes in to say that the Scotch\nSignorina's sunshade is a-bobbing up the path. Then we hastily scald\nourselves with tea and go for a walk, for no longer in this dearth of\nwater can the garden be refreshed, but must needs lie waterless, till\nthe rain revisits us.\n\nTo-day we made an expedition up Monte Gennaro, the great crag that\nrises sheer from the south side of the island in two thousand feet of\nunscalable cliff. From the west the ascent is a mild, upward path over\na stony hill-side, and the more delectable way is on its east side,\nwhere a very steep ascent burrows among thick growing scrub of laburnum\nand arbutus till it reaches the toppling precipices that frown above\nit. There, squeezing through interstices and fissures, it conducts to\na huge grassy upland, unsuspected from below, that sweeps upward to the\nsummit. A pine-tree or two stand sentinel here, but there is little\nanchorage of soil for trees, and for the most part the hill-side is\nclothed in long jungle grasses and spaces of sunny broom, the scent\nof which hangs sweet and heavy in the windless air. Here the dews\nare thicker, and the heat less intense, and though the rain has been\nso long withheld, the hill-side is still green and unwithered, and\ndeep among the grasses we saw abundance of the great orange-coloured\nlilies that we had come to gather. But that task was for the downward\njourney, and first we ascended to the peak itself. As we climbed, the\nisland dwindled below us, and at last at the summit it had shrunk to a\npin's-head in the girdle of the dim sea, domed with huge blue.\n\nWest, south and north, straight to the high horizon, stretched the\nuntarnished and liquid plain; here and there, like some minute fly\nwalking on a vast sheet of sapphire glass, moved an ocean-going\nsteamer. Eastwards there floated, distant and dreamlike but curiously\ndistinct, the shores and peaks of the mainland, and from it, on this\nside and that, there swam the rocks of the Siren isles, as if trying\nto join Alatri, the boldest swimmer of them all. The remoteness and\ntranquillity of mountain tops lay round us, and curious it was to think\nthat down there, where Naples sparkled along the coast, there moved a\ncrowd of insatiable ant-like folk, busy on infinitesimal things that\nabsorbed and vexed and delighted them. Naples itself was so little; it\nwas as if, in this great emptiness of sea and sky, some minute insect\nwas seen, and one was told that that minute insect swarmed with other\nminute forms of life. To look at it was to look at a piece of coral,\nand remember that millions of animalcul\u00c3\u00a6 built up the structure that\nwas but a bead in a necklace. And here, lying at ease on the grass,\nwere just two more of the coral-insects that mattered so much to\nthemselves and to each other....\n\nWe slewed round again seawards, and looked over the precipitous\nsouthern cliffs. A little draught of wind blew up them, making the\ngrasses at the rim shake and tremble. From below a hawk swooped\nupwards over the cliff edge, saw us, and fell away again with a rustle\nof reversed feathers into the air. Round the base of the cliffs the\nsapphire of the sea was trimmed with brilliant bottle-green, and not\nthe faintest line of foam showed where it met the land. To the left on\nthe island, the town of Alatri, with all its house-roofs and spires,\nlooked as flat as on a map, and on the hill-side above it we could\njust make out the stone-pine cutting the white fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the Villa\nTiberiana. For a moment that anchored me to earth; but slipping my\ncable again, I spread myself abroad in the openness and the emptiness.\nWas I part of it, or it part of me? That did not matter much; we were\ncertainly both part of something else, something of tumultuous energy\nthat whirled the stars on their courses, and was yet the peace that\npassed understanding....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe days had slipped away. Before the orange lilies, which we gathered\nthat afternoon on Monte Gennaro, were withered, there remained to me\nbut a week more for the present of island life, which flowed on hour\nby hour in the normal employments that made up the day. But all the\nsmall events, the sights and sounds, had to me then, as they have now,\na curious distinctness, as when before a storm outlines of hills and\nhouses are sharp and defined, and the details of the landscape are\netched vividly in the metallic tenseness of the preceding calm. But, as\nfar as I knew, there were in life generally no threats of approaching\nstorm, no clouds that broke the serenity of the sky. Privately, my\nfriendships and affairs were prosperous, and though by the papers it\nappeared that politicians were turning anxious eyes to Ireland, where\nferment was brewing over Home Rule, I supposed, in the happy-go-lucky\nway in which the average English citizen goes whistling along, that\nthose whose business it was to attend to such things would see to it.\nPersonally I intended to go back to England for a couple of months, and\nthen return here for the warm golden autumn that often lasts into the\nearly days of December. Established now, in this joint house, \"_piccolo\nnido in vasto mar,_\" I meant to slide back often and for prolonged\nperiods down the golden cord that has always bound me to Italy. But\nthough these days were so soon to be renewed, I found myself clinging\nto each minute as it passed with a sense that they were numbered; that\nthe sands were running out, and that close behind the serenity of the\nheavens there lurked the flare of some prodigious judgment. Yet, day\nby day there was nothing to warrant those ominous presages. I swam\nto my cache, smoked my cigarette, basked on the beach, and continued\nweaving the adventures of Mrs. Hancock. The same sense of instability,\nI found, beset Francis also, and this in spite of the fact that the\nbeleaguerings of Miss Machonochie were suddenly and celestially put a\nstop to.\n\nWe had strolled down to the Piazza one evening after dinner, and\nmingled with the crowd that stood watching a great display of\nthunderstorm that was bursting over the mainland twenty miles away.\nAbove us here was a perfectly clear sky, in which the full moon rode\nhigh, and by its light we could see that the whole of the coast was\nsmothered in cloud, out of which broke ten times to the minute flashes\nof lightning, while the low, remote roar of the thunder, faintly echoed\non the cliffs of Monte Gennaro, boomed without ceasing. Then we saw\nthat long streamers of cloud were shooting out of that banked rampart\ntowards us, and we had barely got back to the Villa again before the\nmoon and the stars were obscured, and hot single drops of rain, large\nas a five-franc piece, steamed and vanished on the warm cement of the\nterrace.\n\nAll night long the rain fell in sheets, and through the slats of\nthe shutters I saw the incessant flashes, while the thunder roared\nand rattled overhead, and the pipe from the house-roof, that feeds\nour depleted cistern, gurgled and gulped and swallowed the rain it\nwas thirsting for. Hour after hour the downpour continued, and when\nmorning broke the garden-paths were riddled with water-courses, and\nthe gathered waters gleamed in the cisterns, and Miss Machonochie need\n\"borrow\" no more, nor come up about tea-time to thank Francis for his\nlargesse, and hound us from our tea to seek refuge on arid hill-sides.\nPasqualino remarked that San Costanzo had been a long time thanking us\nfor the fireworks; did I suppose that----And as Pasqualino's remarks\nabout the hierarchy of Heaven are sometimes almost embarrassingly\nchild-like in their reasonableness, I skilfully changed the subject by\ntelling him to measure the water in the cistern.\n\nBut though Francis need no longer be afraid of Miss Machonochie, \"the\narrow that flieth by day\" so constantly transfixing him, and though\nafter prolonged thought he confessed that there was nothing else in\nlife which bothered him, except that in two years' time Pasqualino\nwould have to go for his military service, and he himself would have\nto find another servant (which really seemed a trial, the fieriness of\nwhich need not be allowed to scorch so soon), he shares my sense of\ninstability and uneasiness, and, like me, cannot in any way account\nfor it. To encourage him and myself on the morning of my departure as\nwe had our last bathe, I was noble enough to let him into the secret\nof my cache of cigarettes in the seaweed-hung recess in the rock, and\ntogether we lit the farewell incense to the _Palazzo a mare,_ sitting\non the rock.\n\n\"And there are two left,\" said I, \"which we will smoke together here\nthe first day that I come back.\"\n\n\"Is that a promise?\" he said.\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"And when will you keep it?\"\n\n\"About the middle of September.\"\n\n\"And if you don't?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, it will only mean that I have been run over by a motor-car, or\ngot cancer, or something of the sort, or that you have. If we are still\nin control of ourselves we'll do it. I wonder if those two cigarettes\nwill be mouldy or pickled with brine by that time?\"\n\n\"Kippered or mouldy or pickled, I will smoke one of them on the day you\nreturn,\" said he.\n\n\"And I the other. But I hope it won't be mouldy. Or I shall be sick,\"\nsaid I.\n\n\"Likely. Lord, what a pleasant thing it is to sit on a rock all wet\nin the blaze of the sun! I wonder if it's all too pleasant--whether\nNemesis has her wooden eye on me? Oh, Mother Nemesis, beautiful, kind\nLady Nemesis, remove your wooden eye from me! Your wooden eye offends\nme; pluck it out and cast it from thee! I don't do much harm; I sit in\nthe sea and eat my food, and have a tremendous quantity of great ideas,\nnone of which ever come to anything.\"\n\n\"You might be called lazy, you know,\" said I. \"Lady Nemesis would\nexplain that to you before she beat you.\"\n\n\"I might be called whatever you choose to call me,\" said he, \"but it\nneed not be applicable. I'm not lazy; my brain is an exceedingly busy\none, though it doesn't devote itself to the orthodox pursuits of losing\nmoney in the city and labelling yourself a financier, or playing bridge\nin a country town and labelling yourself a soldier, or writing a lot of\nweary stories and calling yourself an author.\"\n\n\"I never did,\" said I hastily.\n\n\"Well, you permit other people to do so, if you will put on the cap\nlike that. Don't rag, or I shall push you into the sea. I was saying\nthat I was not lazy, because I think. Most people imagine that energy\nmust be spent in action, and they will tell you quite erroneously (as\nyou did just now) that if you don't sit in an office, or something of\nthat kind, or do something, that you are indolent. The reason is that\nmost people can't think, and so when they cease from acting they are\nunemployed. But people who can think are never so busy as when they\ncease from action. Most people are beavers; they build a dam, in which\nthey shut up their souls. And they call it civilization. The world as\npictured by such Progressionists will be an awful place. There will\nbe wonderful drainage, and milk for children, and capsuled food, and\ninoculation against all diseases, and plenty of peace and comfort for\neverybody, and a chromolithograph of Mr. H. G. Wells on every wall.\nThen the millennium will come, the great vegetable millennium, in which\nthe whole human race will stretch from world's end to world's end like\nrows of cabbages, each in his own place in straight lines, and all\nseated on the ground, as the hymn says. Why, the whole glory of the\nhuman race is that we're not content, not happy, missing something\nalways, yearning for something that eludes us and glorifies our\nsearch....\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and drew the thermometer out of the water.\n\n\"It's an affair of conscience,\" he said; \"I do what my conscience tells\nme is of most importance.\"\n\nI felt rather sore at the fact that this afternoon I had to start on\nmy northern career across Europe in a dusty train, with the knowledge\nthat Francis would be here, still cool and clean, in the sea, while the\nsmuts poured in on to the baked red velvet of my carriage, and that\nhere he would remain, while I, dutiful and busy, saw the sooty skies\nof the town on the Thames, which seemed a most deplorable place of\nresidence. Some of this soreness oozed into my words.\n\n\"Your conscience is very kind to you,\" I said. \"It tells you that it is\nof the highest importance that you should live in this adorable island\nand spend your day exactly as you choose.\"\n\n\"But if it said I should go back to England, and sweep a crossing\nin--what's the name of that foul street with a paddock on one side of\nit?--Oh, yes, Piccadilly--sweep a crossing in Piccadilly, I should\ncertainly go!\" said he.\n\nUnfortunately for purposes of argument, I knew that this was true.\n\n\"I know you would,\" I said, \"but on the day of departure you must\nexcuse my being jealous of such a well-ordered conscience. Oh, Francis,\nhow bleak the white cliffs of our beloved England will look! Sometimes\nI really wish Heaven hadn't commanded, and that Britain had remained\nat the bottom of the azure main instead of arising from out of it.\nHow I shall hate the solemn, self-sufficient faces of the English.\nEnglish faces always look as if they knew they were right, and they\ngenerally are, which makes it worse. A quantity of them together are\nso dreadful, large and stupid and proper and rich and pompous, like\nrows of well-cooked hams. Italian faces are far nicer; they're a bed of\npansies, all enjoying the sun and nodding to each other. I don't want\nto go to England! Oh, not to be in England now that July's here! I wish\nyou would come, too. Take a holiday from being good, and doing what\nyour conscience tells you, and spending your days exactly as you like.\nCome and eat beef and beer, and feel the jolly north-east wind and the\nrain and the mud and the fogs, and all those wonderful influences that\nmake us English what we are!\"\n\nFrancis laughed.\n\n\"It all sounds very tempting, very tempting indeed,\" he said. \"But I\nshall resist. The fact is I believe I've ceased to be English. It's\nvery shocking, for I suppose a lack of patriotism is one of the most\nserious lacks you can have. But I've got it. Even your sketch of\nEngland doesn't arouse any thrill in me. Imagine if war was possible\nbetween England and Italy. Where would my sympathies really be? I know\nquite well, but I shan't tell you.\"\n\nThe daily tourist steamer, the same that in a few hours' time would\ntake me away, came churning round the point, going to the Marina, where\nit would lie at anchor till four o'clock. It was obviously crammed with\npassengers--Germans, probably, for the most part, and the strains of\nthe \"Watch by the Rhine\" played by the ship's band (cornet, violin and\nbombardon) came fatly across the water to us. Francis got up.\n\n\"Sorry, but it's time to swim back and dress,\" he said. \"There's the\nsteamer.\"\n\n\"There's the cart for Tyburn,\" said I mournfully.\n\nSo we put the tin box with the thermometer and the two cigarettes to\nbe smoked on the rock one day in the middle of September, back in its\ncurtained cave, and swam to land, lingering and lying on the sea and\nloath to go. Then we dressed and walked through the dappled shade of\nthe olive trees on the cobbled paths between the vineyards to where on\nthe dusty road our carriage waited for us, and so up to the Villa.\n\nI had but little to do in the way of packing, for with this house\npermanently ours and the certainty (in spite of qualms) of coming back\nin a couple of months' time, I was making deposit of clothes here,\nand a few hours later I stood on the deck of the crowded steamer and\nsaw the pier, with Francis standing white and tall on the end of it,\ndiminish and diminish. The width of water between me and the enchanted\nisland increased, and the foam of our wash grew longer, like a white\nriband endlessly laid out on a table of sapphire blue. All round me\nwere crowds of German tourists, gutturally exclaiming on the beauty of\nthe island and the excellence of the beer. And soon the haze of hot\nsummer weather began to weave its veil between us and Alatri: it grew\ndim and unsubstantial; the solidity of its capes and cliffs melted\nand lost its clarity of outline till it lay dream-like and vague, a\nharp-shaped shell of grey floating on the horizon to the west. Already,\nbefore we got to Naples, it seemed years ago that I sat on its beaches\nand swam in its seas with a friend called Francis.\n\n\n\n\nAUGUST, 1914\n\n\nOut of the serene stillness, and with the swiftness of the hurricane,\nthe storm came up. It was in June that there appeared the little cloud,\nno bigger than a man's hand, when the heir to the Austrian throne was\nmurdered at Serajevo. There it hung on the horizon, and none heeded,\nthough in the womb of it lurked the seed of the most terrific tempest\nof blood and fire that the world has ever known. Suddenly in the last\nweek of July that seed fructified, shooting out monstrous tendrils to\nEast and West. A Note was sent from Vienna to Servia making demands,\nand insisting on terms that no State could possibly entertain, if it\nwas henceforth to consider itself a free country. Servia appealed\nto Russia for protection, and Russia remonstrated with those who\nhad framed or (more accurately) those who had sent that Note. The\nremonstrance fell on ears that had determined not to hear, and the\nthrottling pressure of the inflexible hands was not abated. London and\nParis appealed for a conference, for arbitration that might find a\npeaceful solution, for already all Europe saw that here was a firebrand\nthat might set the world aflame. And then we began to see who it was\nthat had caused it to be lit and flung, and who it was that stood over\nit now, forbidding any to quench it.\n\nOut of the gathering darkness there arose, like some overtopping\ngenius, the figure of Germany, with face inexorable and flint-like,\nready at last for _Der Tag,_ for the dawning of which during the last\nforty years she had been making ready, with patient, unremitting toil,\nand hell in her heart. She was clad in the shining armour well known\nin the flamboyant utterances of her megalomaniac Nero, and her hand\ngrasped the sword that she had already half-drawn from its scabbard.\nShe but waited, as a watcher through the night waits for the morn\nthat is imminent, for the event that her schemes had already made\ninevitable, and on the first sign of the mobilization of the Russian\narmies, demanded that that mobilization should cease. Long years she\nhad waited, weaving her dream of world-wide conquest; now she was\nready, and her edict went forth for the dawning of The Day, and, like\nSatan creating the world afresh, she thundered out: \"Let there be\nnight.\" Then she shut down her visor and unsheathed her sword.\n\nShe had chosen her moment well, and, ready for the hazard that should\nmake her mistress of the world, or cause her to cease from among\nthe nations, she paid no heed to Russia's invitation to a friendly\nconference. She wished to confer with none, and she would be friendly\nwith none whom she had not first battered into submission, and ground\ninto serfdom with her iron heel. On both her frontiers she was\nprepared; on the East her mobilization would be complete long before\nthe Russian troops could be brought up, and gathering certain of her\nlegions on that front, she pulled France into the conflict. For on\nthe Western front she was ready, too; on the word she could discharge\nher troops in one bull-like rush through Belgium, and, holding the\nshattered and dispersed armies of France in check, turn to Russia\nagain. Given that she had but those two foes to deal with, it seemed to\nher that in a few weeks she must be mistress of Europe, and prepared\nat high noon of _Der Tag_ to attack the only country that really stood\nbetween her and world-wide dominion. She was not seeking a quarrel with\nEngland just yet, and she had strong hopes that, distracted by the\nimminence of civil war in Ireland, we should be unable to come to the\nhelp of our Allies until our Allies were past all help. Here she was\nstaking on an uncertainty, for though she had copious information from\nher army of spies, who in embassy and consulate and city office had\neaten the bread of England, and grasped every day the hands of English\ncitizens, it could not be regarded as an absolute certainty that\nEngland would stand aside. But she had strong reasons to hope that she\nwould.\n\nIt was on the first day of this month that Germany shut her visor down\nand declared war on Russia. Automatically, this would spread the flame\nof war over France, and next day it was known that Germany had asked\nleave to march her armies through Belgium, making it quite clear that\nwhatever answer was given her, she would not hesitate to do it. Belgium\nrefused permission, and appealed to England. On Monday, August 3rd,\nGermany was at war with France, and began to move her armies up to and\nacross the Belgian frontier, violating the territory she had sworn to\nrespect, and strewing the fragments of her torn-up honour behind her.\nNecessity, she averred, knew no law, and since it was vital for the\nsuccess of her dream of world-conquest that her battalions should pass\nthrough Belgium, every other consideration ceased to exist for her.\nNational honour, the claim, the certificate of a country's right to be\nreckoned among the civilizing powers of the world, must be sacrificed.\nShe burned in the flame of the war she had kindled the patent of her\nrights to rank among civilized states.\n\nIt was exactly this, which meant nothing to her, that meant everything\nto us, and it upset the calculation on which Germany had based her\naction, namely, that England was too much distracted by internal\nconflict to interfere. There was a large party, represented in the\nGovernment, which held that the quarrel of Germany with France and\nRussia was none of our business, and that we were within our rights\nto stand aside. All that Monday the country waited to know what the\ndecision of the Cabinet and of the House would be.\n\nThe suspense of those hours can never be pictured. It belongs to the\nnightmare side of life, where the very essence of the threatening\nhorror lies in the fact that it is indefinite. But this I know, that\nto thousands of others, even as to myself, England, from being a vague\nidea in the background which we took for granted and did not trouble\nabout, leaped into being as a mother, or a beloved personage, of whose\nflesh and bone we were, out of whose womb we had sprung. All my life,\nI am willing to confess I had not given her a thought, I had not even\nconsciously conceived of her as a reality; she had been to me but like\nthe heroine of some unreal sentimental tale, a thing to blush at if she\nwas publicly spoken of. But on those days she, who had hitherto meant\nnothing to me, sprang to life, deep-bosomed, with patient hands and\ntender eyes, in which was no shadow of reproach for all those years of\ncareless contempt. And by the curious irony of things, on the day that\nshe was revealed to me, she stood in a place, from which, if she chose,\nshe could withdraw herself into isolation, and from which, if she\nchose, she could step forth to meet the deadliest peril that had ever\nassailed her. But even in the moment of the first knowledge and love\nof her that had ever entered my soul, I prayed in a silent agony of\nanxiety that she should leave her sheltered isle for the unimaginable\ndanger of the tempest that raged beyond the sea that was hers. For,\nindeed, if she did not, she was but a phantom of the pit; no mother of\nmine, but some unspeakable puppet, a thing to be hidden away in her\nshame and nakedness.\n\nIt was known that night that England would not tolerate the violation\nof Belgian soil, and had sent an ultimatum to Germany which would\nexpire in twenty-four hours. And from the whole country there went up\none intense sigh of relief that we were resolved to embark on what\nmust be the most prodigious war that the world had ever seen. \"Give War\nin our time, O Lord!\" was the prayer of all who most truly knew that\nthe only peace possible to us was a peace which would stamp the name\nof England with indelible infamy. And God heard their prayer, and on\nWednesday we woke to a world where all was changed. The light-hearted,\nluxurious, unreflective days were gone, never probably in our time to\nreturn. Already the tempest of fire and blood was loosened in Europe; a\nline was drawn across the lives of everyone, and for the future there\nwere but two periods in one's consciousness, the time before the war,\nand war-time.\n\nIt was during this week that I had a long letter from Francis written\nbefore the English ultimatum was known, but delayed in posts that\nwere already scrutinized and censored. Though I had no friend in the\nworld so intimate as he, his letter revealed him now as a person\nstrangely remote, speaking an unintelligible language. So little a\nwhile ago I had spoken the same tongue as he; now all he said seemed\nto be gibberish, though his sentiments were just such as I might have\nexpressed myself, if, since then, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday\nhad not been among the days of my life.\n\n        \"Things look black,\" he said, \"and the papers, for once\n        reflecting the mind of the people, are asking what Italy\n        will do, if Germany and Austria go to war with France\n        and Russia. I believe (and, remember, I speak entirely\n        from the Italian point of view, for verily I have long\n        ceased to be English) that it is frankly impossible that\n        we should range ourselves side by side with Austria, our\n        hereditary foe. It seems one of the things that can't\n        happen; no ministry could remain in office that proposed\n        that. And yet we are the ally of Austria and Germany,\n        unless it is true, as the _Corriere_ tells us, that the\n        terms of our alliance only bind us to them in the event\n        of aggression on the part of two nations of the Triple\n        Entente. Be that as it may, I don't believe we can come\n        in with Austria.\n\n        \"I am extremely glad of it, for I am one of those\n        queer creatures who do not believe that a quarrel\n        between two countries can be justly settled by making\n        a quantity of harmless young men on both sides shoot\n        each other. I don't see that such a method of settling\n        a dispute proves anything beyond showing which side\n        has the better rifles, and has been better trained,\n        unless you deliberately adopt the rule of life that\n        'Might is Right.' If you do let us be consistent, and\n        I will waylay Caterina as she goes home with the money\n        Seraphina has given her for the washing, rob, and, if\n        necessary, murder her. If she proves to be stronger than\n        me, she will scratch my face and bring her money safely\n        home. And her father will try to shoot me next day, and\n        I will try to shoot him. That's the logical outcome of\n        Might is Right.\n\n        \"I am glad, too, of this, that I myself am a\n        denationalized individual, and if I have a motherland\n        at all, it is this beloved stepmother-land, who for so\n        long has treated me as one of her children. Damnable as\n        I think war is, I think I could fight for her, if anyone\n        slapped her beautiful face. And yet how could I fight\n        against the country to whom we owe not only so much of\n        the art and science, but of Thought itself? Germany\n        taught mankind how to think.\n\n        \"Let me know how things go in England. It looks as if\n        you could keep out of this hurly-burly. So if Italy\n        does too, I hope to see you here again in September.\n        Seraphina suggests that Italy should make pretence of\n        being friends with the '_bestia fedente,_' by which she\n        means the Austrians, and that when they are fighting the\n        Russians, she should run swiftly from them and seize the\n        Trentino again. There seems much good sense in this, for\n        'the Trentino is ours, and it is right and proper to\n        take what belongs to us.'\n\n        \"England must be peculiarly beastly with all these\n        disturbances going on. Why don't you pack up your\n        tooth-brush and your comb and come back again at once?\n        The _Palazzo a mare_ is better than Piccadilly, and the\n        purple figs are ripe, and the cones are dropping from\n        the stone-pine, and never were there such fat kernels\n        for Seraphina to fry in oil. Perhaps if you come back\n        the _strega_ would continue walking; she seems to have\n        had no exercise since you were here. Your room is empty,\n        and the door makes sorrowful faces at me as I go along\n        the passage. It frowns at me, and says it isn't I it\n        wants. And I share the silent verdict of your door.\n\n        \"I don't see what quarrel England can have with Germany,\n        and it is unthinkable that Italy should go in with the\n        Central Powers against the Triple Entente. Besides,\n        how is England to fight Germany? It is the elephant\n        and the whale. England hasn't got an army, has it? I\n        can't remember anything connected with soldiers in\n        England, except some sort of barracks with a small\n        temple or chapel in front of it somewhere in St. James's\n        Park. And I suppose the German fleet is only a sort of\n        herring-boat compared to a liner, if it comes to ships.\n        So really I don't see how the two countries could fight\n        each other even if they wanted to.\n\n        \"Even if you don't come now, you'll be certain to be\n        back in September, won't you? Otherwise I shall think\n        that there is some validity in presentiments, for you\n        went away with a notion that it was not only for a\n        month or two that you went. Better put an end to vain\n        superstition by coming back before.\n\n        \"Ever yours,\n\n        \"Francis.\"\n\n        \"P.S.--Send a wire if you are coming. They say the posts\n        are disorganized.\n\n        \"Donna Margherita has had words with Miss Machonochie's\n        cook. I'm sure I don't want any harm to come to Miss\n        Machonochie or her household, but I think there must\n        already be a leak in her cistern. That would be a good\n        day's work for Donna Margherita, wouldn't it? Otherwise,\n        when we all have plenty of water, why should Miss M.\n        alone be wanting it?\"\n\nReading this, I felt for a moment here and there that the events of\nthis last week must have been a dream, so vividly did the island and\nthe island life etch themselves on a page. For a half second I could\nsmell the frying of the pine-kernels, could hear Pasqualino's quick\nstep across the passage, as he entered from his Brang\u00c3\u00a4ene duty on the\nbalcony to tell us that Miss Machonochie's foot was coming firmly up\nthe steps. But the next moment the huge background of war was set up\nagain, and all these things were strangely remote and dim. They had\nhappened, perhaps, at least I seemed to remember them, but they no\nlonger had any touch of reality about them, were of the quality of\ndreams.... The same unreality possessed Francis's suave surmises about\nthe improbability of England's going to war with Germany, for the only\nthing that was actual was that she had done so. And not less unreal\nwas the fact of Francis himself living the life that he and I also had\nlived before this cataclysm came. All that belonged to some prehistoric\nperiod which ceased something less than a week ago. Less than a week\nago, too, I had been baptized and become a member of England, and\nalready, so swiftly does the soul no less than the body adjust itself\nto changed conditions, the sense of having ever been otherwise, had\nvanished as completely as the aching of a tooth after the offender has\nbeen dealt with, and you can no longer imagine the pain it gave you.\n\nBut the letter was a difficult one to answer; I could not convey to\nhim what had happened to me, any more than in this letter he could,\nexcept for a transient second, convey to me a realization of what\nhad not happened to him. I began a dozen times: \"I have just been to\nTrafalgar Square, and cannot picture to you the thrill that 'Rule,\nBritannia'\"----Clearly that would not do. I tried again with a jest\nto hide the seriousness of it: \"What do they know of England who\nonly Italy know?\" I tried yet again: \"Since seeing you something has\nhappened that makes----\"\n\nAnd at that moment the cry of a newsvendor in the street made me\nrush out for the sixth time that afternoon to see what the latest\ninformation was. Li\u00c3\u00a8ge still held out, it seemed, though it was\nrumoured that certain of its forts had fallen. But still the most\ngallant of the little States held up the Titanic invasion that was\npouring down upon it, maintaining in the face of terrific pressure its\nprotest and its resistance to the onrush of that infamous sea, in the\ndepths of which German honour already lay drowned. How could any man\nfail to know what the sense of the native land, of patriotism meant,\nwhen he saw what a supreme meaning it actually did have? It is the\nfashion of cynics to say that mankind will suffer and deny themselves\nfor the sake of some definite concrete thing, like money or a jewel\nor a picture, but never for an idea. Here was an instance that blew\nsuch cynicism to atoms. Already the soil of Belgium, its cities and its\nplains were lost, and its people knew it But they fought, beaten and\nindomitable, just because it was an idea that inspired them--namely,\nthe freedom of those who were already conquered (for none could doubt\nthe outcome), the independence of the country which must soon for\ncertain lay beneath the heel of Prussian murderers, who slew their\nchildren and violated their women, and could no more touch the spirit\nof the people than they could quench the light of the moon. Normally,\nperhaps, we more often feel the pull and the press of material things;\nbut when there is heard in a man's soul the still small voice, which\nis greater than fire or earthquake, his true being wakes, and at the\nspiritual call, whether of religion or love or patriotism, he answers\nto an idea that far transcends all the beckonings of material sense.\nIt is then that those we thought smug and comfort-smothered, bound in\nthe bonds of peaceful prosperity, break from their earth-bound fetters\nand their sleep at the voice of the God which is immanent in them.\nThere is no material profit to gain, but all to lose, and eagerly, like\nballast that keeps them down, they cast everything else overboard, and\nsweep soaring into the untarnishable sunlight of their real being. For\nit is not only the stocks and stones of his native land that a man\nloves, any more than it is just the eyebrows and the throat of his\nmistress that he worships. He loves them because they are symbols and\nexpression of her who inhabits them. They are the bodily tokens of the\nbeloved spirit that dwells there. Under that inspiration the dumb lips\nprophecy, as the coal from the altar is laid on them, and their land\nbecomes a temple filled, even in the darkness of their affliction, with\nthe glory of the Lord. The terror by night and the arrow that flieth by\nday have no power to daunt them, for high above earthly things is set\ntheir house of defence.\n\nThere rose then from this quiet little land, sure and untroubled as\nthe rising of the moon, a race of heroes. From further east, across\nthe Rhine, there was another rising, the monstrous birth of a presence\nand a portent undreamed of. It towered into the sky, and soon at its\nbreath the forts of Li\u00c3\u00a8ge and of Namur crumbled and fell, and it\npassed on phallic and murderous over the corpses of slain children and\nviolated mothers. Those who thought they knew Germany could not at\nfirst believe that this was the spirit and these the infamies of the\nland they loved. She who had stood for so much to them, she the mother\nof music, the cradle of sciences, the lover of all that was lovely, was\nchanged as by the waving of a magician's rod into a monster of hell,\noozing with the slime of the nethermost pit. Many could not credit the\ntales that flooded the press, and put them down to mere sensational\nnews-mongering. But they were true, though they were not the whole\ntruth; the half of it had not been told us. The race of musicians,\nscientists, artists, of chivalrous knights, still took as their motto:\n\"The women and children first.\" But they played upon the words, and\nsmiled to each other at the pun. Pleading the necessity that knows no\nlaw, they had torn up their treaty, avowing that it was but a scrap of\npaper, and dishonouring for ever the value of their word, now, like\nsome maniac, they mutilated the law they had murdered. It may be that\nGermany was but the first victim of Prussian militarism, and Belgium\nthe second; but Germany had sold its soul, and it kept its bargain with\nthe power that had bought it.\n\nWhile still Francis's letter remained unanswered on my desk, I received\nanother from him, written several days later, which had made a quicker\ntransit.\n\n        \"This is all damnable,\" he said. \"Of course we had to\n        come in when Belgium was invaded. I skulked all day\n        in the house while it was yet uncertain, for I simply\n        dared not show an English face in the streets for shame.\n        Thank God that's all right. I never thought I could\n        have cared so much. They sang 'Rule, Britannia,' in the\n        Piazza to-day, wonderfully vague and sketchy. You know\n        what my singing is, but I tell you I joined. It was a\n        strange thing to hear that tune in a country which was\n        supposed to be allied with the nation on whom England\n        has declared war, but there it was. They say that Italy\n        has declared neutrality. You'll know by the time you get\n        this whether that is so. By the way, if it is true that\n        we are sending an Expeditionary Force to France, just\n        send me a wire, will you? The papers are full of news\n        one day which is contradicted the next, and one doesn't\n        know what to believe about England's attitude and doings.\n\n        \"There's no news on this dead-alive island. I feel\n        frightfully cut off, and it's odd to feel cut off in the\n        place where you've lived for so long. I began an article\n        on the early French mystics last week, but I can't get\n        on with it. Mind you send me a telegram.\n\n        \"Francis.\"\n\nI sent the telegram saying that an Expeditionary Force to help the\nFrench to hold their frontier had already landed in France, and more\nmen were being sent. Next morning I received a brief telegram in answer:\n\n        \"Am starting for England to-day.\"\n\nLi\u00c3\u00a8ge fell, Namur fell, and like a torrent that has gathered strength\nand volume from being momentarily damned up, the stream of the invaders\nroared through France, and on her as well as on England descended\nthe perils of their darkest and most hazardous hour. Sheer weight\nof metal drove the line of the Allies back and back, wavering and\ndinted but never broken. In England, but for the hysterical screams\nof a few journalists who spoke of the \"scattered units\" of a routed\narmy making their way back singly or in small companies, the temper\nof the nation remained steadfast and unshaken, and in France, though\ndaily the thunder of the invaders boomed ever nearer to Paris, nothing\nhad power to shake the inflexible will of our ally. It mattered not\nthat the seat of the Government must be transferred to Bordeaux, and\nthither they went; but the heart of France beat on without a tremor,\nwaiting for the day which none doubted would come, when they turned\nand faced the advancing tide, breasted it, and set up the breakwater\nthat stretched from the North Sea to the borders of Switzerland.\nRight across France was it established, through ruined homesteads and\ndevastated valleys, and against it in vain did the steel billows beat.\n\nHere I have a little anticipated events, for it was in the days while\nstill the Germans swept unchecked across north-eastern France that\nFrancis arrived, after a devious and difficult journey, that brought\nhim on shipboard at Havre. He had no psychological account to give of\nthe change that had occurred between his first letter and his telegram;\nhe had simply been unable to do anything else than come.\n\n\"I know you like analysis,\" he said, \"but really there is no analysis\nto give you. I was, so I found myself, suddenly sick with anxiety that\nEngland should come into the war (I think I wrote you that), and when\nyour telegram came, saying we were sending a force abroad, I merely had\nto come home and see if there was anything for me to do. One has got\nto do something, you know, got to do something! Fancy my having been\nEnglish all these years, and it's only coming out now, like getting\nmeasles when you're grown up.\"\n\nThere was no need then to explain, and Francis, in his philosophical\nmanner, tried to define what it was that had so moved him, and found,\nas so often happens when we attempt to fit words to a force that is\ncompletely unmaterial, that he could at first only mention a quantity\nof things that it was not. It was not that he felt the smallest\naffection for London, or Lincoln, or Leeds; he did not like Piccadilly\nany more than he had done before, or the mud, or the veiled atmosphere.\nNor did he regard any of the inhabitants of our island with a greater\nwarmth than previously. Besides myself, he had after his long absence\nabroad no one whom he could call a friend, and of the rest, the porter\nwho had carried his luggage to the train at Southampton had not thanked\nhim for a reasonable tip; the guard had been uncivil; the motor driver\nwho brought him to my house was merely a fool. Indeed, whatever\ncomponent part of the entity that made up England he considered, he\nfound he disliked it, and yet the thought of all those disagreeable\nthings as a whole had been enough to make him leave the siren isle,\nand come post-haste across the continent to get to that surly northern\ntown, in which he had not set foot for a dozen years. And, being here,\nhe did not regret, as an impulsive and ill-considered step, his exile\nfrom Alatri. There was no fault to be found with that; it had been\nas imperative as the physical needs of thirst and hunger. He got up,\ngesticulating, in Italian fashion.\n\n\"Where does it come from?\" he said. \"What is it that called me? Is it\nsomething from without? Is it a mixture, a chemical soul-mixture of the\ngrumpy porter and the grey sea, and this dismal, half-lit afternoon\nthat is considered a lovely day in London? Or is it from within, some\ninstinct bred from fifty generations of English blood, that just sat\nquiet in me and only waited till it was wanted? I hate doing things\nwithout knowing the reason why I do them. I always said 'Why?' when I\nwas a child, and I only don't say 'Why?' now, because if I want to know\nsomething, I sit and think about it instead of asking other people. But\nall the way here I've been considering it, and I can't see why I had to\ncome back. I don't think it's only something internal. There's a magnet\noutside that suddenly turned its poles to us, and instantly we jumped\nto it like iron filings and stuck there. There's no shirking it. There\nI was in Italy, saying to myself that I wasn't an iron filing, and\nshould stop exactly where I was. But the magnet didn't care. It just\nturned towards me, and I jumped. It will keep me attached, I suppose,\nas long as there's any use for me.\"\n\nHe was feeling his way gropingly but unerringly down into himself,\nand I listened as this, the simplest of men, but that deft surgeon of\nminds, cut and dissected down into his own.\n\n\"The magnet, the magnet!\" he said. \"I think that the magnet is\nsomething that lies behind mere patriotism. Patriotism perhaps is the\nsteel of which it is made; it is the material through which the force\nis sent, the channel of its outpouring, but ... but it isn't only to\nput myself at the disposal of England in my infinitesimal manner that I\nhave come back. England is the steel of the magnet--yes, just that; but\nEngland isn't the force that magnetizes it.\"\n\nHe dropped down on the hearth-rug, and lay there with the back of his\nhands over his eyes, as he so often lay on the beach at the _Palazzo a\nmare._\n\n\"I haven't wasted all those years at Alatri,\" he said, \"when I was\ngardening and mooning about and looking at the sea. I have come to\nrealize what I remember saying to you once, when I picked up a bit\nof green stone on the beach, that it was you or me and God. To do\nthat I had got to get out of myself.... We collect a hard shell round\nourselves like mussels or oysters, and we speak of it as 'ours.' It's\njust that which we are bound to get rid of, if we are to see things\nin any way truly. We talk of 'having' things; that's the illusion we\nsuffer from. We can't enter into our real kingdom till we quite get rid\nof the sense that anything is ours, thus abdicating from the kingdom we\nfalsely believed to be our own. That's the glorious and perfect paradox\nof mysticism. We have everything the moment we get rid of ourselves,\nand the sense that we have anything. You can express it in a hundred\nways: the lover expresses it when he says: 'Oh, my beloved, I am you!'\nChrist expresses it when He says: 'What shall it profit a man if he\ngain the whole world, and lose his own soul?' As long as you cling to\nanything, you can't get at your soul, in which is God.\n\n\"Patriotism, standing by the honour of your country when your country\nis staking itself on a principle, seems to me a materialization of this\nforce, the steel through which it can act. Well, when you believe in\na principle, as I do, you've got to live up to your belief in it, and\nsuffer any amount of personal inconvenience. You mustn't heed that, or\nelse you are not getting outside yourself. So if England wants a limb\nor an eye, or anything else, why, it's hers, not mine.\"\n\nHe was silent a moment.\n\n\"And perhaps there's another thing, another drama, another war going\non,\" he said. \"Do you remember some fable in Plato, where Socrates\nsays that all that happens here upon earth is but a reflection, an\nadumbration of the Real? Is it possible, do you think, that in the\nsphere of the eternal some great conflict is waging, and Michael and\nhis angels are fighting against the dragon? Plato is so often right,\nyou know. He says that is why beauty affects the soul, because the soul\nis reminded of the true beauty, which it saw once, and will see again.\nWhy else should we love beauty, you know?\"\n\nHe got up with a laugh.\n\n\"But it's puzzling work is talking, as Mr. Tulliver said. However,\nthere's my guess at the answer of the riddle, as to why I came home.\nAnd it really is such a relief to me to find that I didn't cling to\nwhat I had. I was always afraid that I might, when it came to the\npoint. But it wasn't the slightest effort to give it up, all that\nsecure quiet life; the effort would have been not to give it up. I\ndon't in the least want to be shot, or taken prisoner, or brutally\nmaimed, but if any of those things are going to happen to me, I shan't\nquarrel with them.\"\n\n\"And when the war is over?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, naturally, I shall go back to Alatri by the earliest possible\ntrain and continue thinking. That's what I'm alive for, except when\nit's necessary to act my creed, instead of spelling out more of it. I\nsay, may we have dinner before long? This beastly bracing English air\nmakes me very hungry.\"\n\nFrancis refused all thought of getting a commission, since it seemed\nto him that this was not doing the thing properly, and enlisted next\nday as a private. For myself, since circumstances over which I had no\ncontrol prevented my doing anything of the sort, I found work connected\nwith the war which to some extent was a palliative of the sense of\nuselessness. It was quite dull, very regular, and entailed writing an\nimmense quantity of letters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd at this point I propose to pass over a whole year in which the grim\nrelentless business went on. Like wrestlers, the opposing armies on the\nWestern Front were locked in a deadly grip, each unable to advance,\neach refusing to give ground. On the east Russia advanced and was\nswept back again; in the Balkans, owing to our inept diplomacy Turkey\nand Bulgaria joined the enemy. During the spring Italy abandoned\nher neutrality and joined the Allies. Expeditions were sent out to\nMesopotamia and the Dardanelles. For a year the war flamed, and the\nsmoke of its burning overshadowed the earth.\n\n\n\n\nSEPTEMBER, 1915\n\n\nI do not suppose that there is any literal truth in that remarkable\npiece of natural history which tells us that eels get used to being\nskinned. It may have been invented by those who like eating that\nexecrable worm, or, more probably, it is a proverbial simile which\nis meant to convey a most unquestionable truth, namely, that however\nunpleasant a thing may be, in time we get adjusted to it. It would\nbe an ill thing for the human race if they did not, and argues no\ncallousness on their part. It is simply one of Nature's arrangements,\nan example of the recuperative power which enables us to throw off\ncolds, and mends the skin when we have cut ourselves shaving. If every\nwound, physical and moral alike, remained raw, the race could not\ncontinue, but would speedily expire from loss of blood and gangrene.\nAnd if in process of time we did not rally from staggering blows, we\nshould all of us, at an early age lie prone on our backs, squealing,\ntill death mercifully put an end to our troubles. But all our lives we\nare receiving wounds and blows, and we recuperate. Only once during\nthis mortal existence do we fail to recover, more or less, from things\nthat at first seemed intolerable, and then we die.\n\nThis invariable rule applies to the position in which we find ourselves\nafter thirteen months of war. Most of us have suffered intimate losses;\nthere is scarcely a man or woman in England whom death has not robbed\nof some friend or relation. But we are not as a nation bewildered\nand all abroad, as we were thirteen months ago. We do not wake every\nmorning with the sense that after the oblivion of the night we are\nroused to a nightmare existence. We have somehow adjusted ourselves\nto what is happening, and this adjustment argues no callousness or\ninsensibility; it is just the result of the natural process by virtue\nof which we are enabled to continue living. Also, the need that Francis\nfelt when he said, \"One must do something,\" has come to the aid of\nthose who in general, before the days of the war, never did anything\nparticular beyond amusing themselves. This really implied that other\npeople had got to amuse them by giving them dinner-parties and concerts\nand what not, and since these had no time to attend to them now, a\nremarkably large percentage of the drones, finding that nobody was\nproviding for them, set to work for once in their lives, and slaved\naway at funds or hospitals or soup-kitchens, and found that to do\nsomething for other people was not half so tedious as they had supposed\nbefore they gave it a trial. This was a very salutary piece of natural\nadjustment, and they all felt much the better for it. A certain number\nof confirmed drones I suppose there will always be, but certainly\nLondon has become a much more industrious hive than it ever used to be.\n\nAnother process has contributed to the recuperative process, for\nthe details of life have been much simplified. When your income is\nruthlessly cut down, as has happened to most of us, it is clear that\nsomething must be done. The first thing we all did, naturally, was to\nraise a wild chorus of asserting that we were ruined. But when these\nminor strains did not seem to mend matters much, most people, under\nthe recuperative force, began to consider and make catalogues of all\nthe things which they could quite well do without. It is astonishing\nhow voluminous these catalogues were. Those who had footmen who went\nto the war, like proper young men, suddenly found out that there were\nsuch things as parlour-maids. Those who rolled about in motor-cars\ndiscovered that there were taxicabs, and it was even hinted in more\nadvanced circles that 'buses plied upon the London streets and tubes\nunderneath them. There was some vague element of sport about it: it\nwas something new to lie in ambush at a street corner and pounce on\nNo. 19 that went up Sloane Street and along Shaftesbury Avenue, or get\nhopelessly befogged in the stupefying rabbit warrens that are excavated\nbelow Piccadilly Circus.\n\nIn spite, then, of the huge tragedies, the cruel bereavements, the\ndistress among those whose economies were in no way a game, but a\ngrinding necessity, we have adjusted ourselves, and are alive to\nthe amazing fact that the day of little things, the small ordinary\ncaresses and pleasures of life, is not over. For a while it was utterly\ndarkened, the sun stood in full-orbed eclipse, but now (not callously)\nwe can take pleasure in our little amusements and _festas_ and fusses,\nthough, owing to more useful occupations, we have not so much time for\nthem. To compare a small affair with these great ones, I remember how\na few years ago I suddenly had to face a serious operation. The moment\nat which I was told this was one of black horror. There the doctor\nsat opposite me, looking prosperous and comfortable, and said: \"You\nmust make up your mind to it; have it done at once.\" Being a profound\nphysical coward, the thing seemed quite unfaceable, an impossibility.\nBut before an hour was up, the adjustment had come, and once more the\nsavour of the world stole back. The sun that day was just as warm as it\nhad ever been, food was good, the faces of friends were dear, and the\nnight before it was to take place I slept well, and when finally I was\ntold it was time to go along the passage to where the operation was to\nbe done, I remember turning down the page of the book I was reading and\nwondering less what was going to happen to me than to the characters\nof the novel. Nothing, in fact, is unfaceable when you have to face\nit; nothing entirely robs the eye and the ear of its little accustomed\npleasures.\n\nBut what is much more important than the fact that the little things\nof life have put forth their buds again is that as a nation our eyes,\nhalf closed in dreamy contentment, have been opened to the day of\ngreat things. The outbreak of war in August last year was an earthquake\ninconceivable and overwhelming; but it has become one of the things\nthat is, an austere majestic fact. Among its d\u00c3\u00a9bris and scarred\nsurfaces, not only has the mantle of growth with which Nature always\nclothes her upheavals begun to spring up, but the smoke of its ruin,\nlike the cloud of ash over Vesuvius, has soared into high places,\nand its deepest shadows are lit with splendours that irradiate and\ntransfigure them. It is not of terror alone that tragedy is compounded;\nthere is pity in it as well, the pity that enlightens and purges, the\nunsealing of the human heart. God knows what still lies in the womb of\nthe future, but already there has come to us a certain steadfastness\nthat lay dormant, waiting for the trumpet to awaken it. We are, it\nis to be hoped, a little simpler, a little more serious, a little\nbusier over doing obvious duties, a little less set on amusements and\nextravagancies. And I do not think we are the worse for that. The\nfaith in which we entered the war, that ours was a righteous quarrel,\nhas proved itself unshakeable; the need to stand firm has knitted the\nnation together.\n\nOf our necessities, our failures, our endeavours and our rewards in\nthese great matters, it is not possible to speak, for they are among\nthe sacred things that dwell in silence. But there are, you may say,\ncertain condiments in life which can be spoken of. First and foremost\namong them is a sense of humour, which has been extremely useful.\nWithout losing sight of the main issue, or wanting to forget the tragic\ngravity of it all, it would be ridiculous to behave like pessimists and\npacifists, and with distorted faces of gloom and pain, to shudder at\nthe notion of finding anything to smile at. Even while we are aghast at\nthe profanity with which the German Emperor regards himself as a Moses\nof the New Dispensation, and steps down from the thunderclouds of Sinai\nwith the tables that have been personally entrusted to him, on the\nstrength of which he orders his submarines to torpedo peaceful merchant\nvessels, we cannot (or should not) help smiling at this Imperial\nbuffoon. Or why waste a shudder on his idiot son, when a smile would\nnot be wasted, since it would do us good? Surely there are bright spots\nin the blackness. Or again, though hate is a most hellish emotion, and\nit is, of course, dreadful to think of one white nation being taught to\nhate another, yet when people compose a hymn of hate for the English,\nwords and music, and have it printed and sold at a loss all over the\nGerman Empire in order to root more firmly yet the invincible resolve\nof the Teuton to strafe England, is it reasonable not to feel cheered\nup by the ludicrousness of these proceedings? Certainly it is a pity\nto hate anybody; but, given that, may we not treasure tenderly this\ncrowning instance of the thoroughness of the frightful German race? I\nam glad they did that; it does me good. When I think of that, my food,\nas Walt Whitman says, nourishes me more. I like to think of Prince\nOscar sending a telegram to his father, saying that he has had the\noverpowering happiness to be wounded for the sake of the Fatherland. I\nam glad his father sent for a Press agent and had those precious words\npublished in every paper in the Fatherland, and I trust that Prince\nOscar, since he likes being wounded so much, will get well quickly and\ngo back and be wounded again. I am pleased that when Russia was sending\nhundreds of thousands of troops through England to join the Western\nbattle-line, the fact was put beyond a doubt by somebody's gamekeeper\nseeing bearded men getting out of a train at Swindon on a hot day and\nstamping the snow from their boots, which proved they had come from\nArchangel.... It all helps. Queen Elizabeth was a wise woman when she\nsaid that we have need of mirth in England. God knows we have.\n\nI have been a year in London, hardly stirring from it by reason\nof things to do; but a fortnight ago I escaped into Norfolk for a\nbreathing-space of air and sea. It was a good sea, in the manner of\nnorthern seas, and though it was impossible not to contrast it with\nthe hot beach and lucid waters of the _Palazzo a mare,_ I would not\nhave exchanged it for that delectable spot. High, sheer sand-cliffs\nlined the coast, and on their edges were dug trenches with parapets\nof sandbags, while here and there, where the cliffs were broken away,\nthere were lines of barbed wire entanglements. These, I must hope,\nwere only, so to speak, practice efforts, for I found it saved time,\nwhen going down to bathe early, to step through these, with an eye to\npyjama legs, rather than walk an extra hundred yards to a gap in those\ncoast defences. But it all gave one a sense that this was England,\nalert and at war, and the sea itself aided the realization. For there\nevery day would pass cruisers or torpedo-boats, no longer in peaceful\nmanoeuvres, but engaged, swift and watchful, on their real business.\nSometimes one would be running parallel with the coast, and then turn\nand roar seawards, till only a track of smoke on the horizon marked\nits passage. But that was the real thing; the armour of England was\nbuckled on; it was no longer just being polished and made ready. The\nwhole coast was patrolled, and all was part of one organized plan of\ndefence, and when the moment came, of offence; somewhere out there the\nGrand Fleet waited, as it had waited more than a year; these ships that\npassed and went seaward again were the sentries that walked round the\nforts of the ocean.\n\nA week on the coast was followed by a few days at a country house\ninland before I returned to London, and once again the realization of\nwar had a vivid moment. The house where I was staying was surrounded by\npheasant covers that came close up to the garden, where one night after\ndinner I was straying with a friend. It was warm and still; the odour\nof the night-blooming stocks hung on the air; the sky was windless and\nslightly overclouded, so that the stars burned as if through frosted\nglass, and we were in the dark of the moon. Then suddenly from the\nsleeping woods arose an inexplicable clamour of pheasant's cries; the\nplace was more resonant with them than at the hour when they retired\nto roost. Every moment fresh crowings were added to the tumult. I\nhave never heard so strange an alarum. It did not die down again,\nbut went on and on. Then presently through it, faintly at first, but\nwith growing distinctness, came a birring rhythmical beat, heavy and\nsonorous. It came beyond doubt from the air, not from the land, and\nwas far more solid, more heavy in tone, than any aeroplanes I had ever\nheard. Then my friend pointed. \"Look!\" he said. There, a little to the\neast, a black shape, long and cylindrical, sped across the greyness of\nthe shrouded sky, moving very rapidly westward. Soon it was over our\nheads; before long it had passed into indistinctness again. But long\nafter its beat had become inaudible to our ears, the screams of the\npheasants continued, as they yelled at the murderer on the way to the\nscene of his crime.\n\nFor half an hour after that some stir of uneasiness went on in the\nwoods; the furred and feathered creatures were aware, by some sixth\nsense, that there was danger in the air. Then muffled and distant came\nthe noise of explosions and the uneasiness of the woodland grew to\npanic again, with rustlings in the brushwood of hares seeking cover,\nand the cries of birds seeking each other, and asking what was this\nterror by night. Presently afterwards the beat of the propellers was\nagain audible to human ears, and the Zeppelin passed over us once\nmore, flying invisible at a great height, going eastwards again. It\nwas moving much faster now, for its deadly work was over, and, flushed\nwith its triumph, it was bearing home the news of its glorious exploit.\nThose intrepid crusaders, Lohengrins of the air, had taken their toll\nof smashed cottages, slain children and murdered mothers, and the\nanointed of the Lord next morning, hearing of their great valour above\na small Norfolk hamlet, would congratulate them on their glorious\nexploit and decorate them with iron crosses to mark his shameful\napproval of their deed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLondon at night has become a dim Joseph's coat of many colours. The\nauthorities are experimenting in broken rainbows for the sake of our\nsafety from above, and for our vastly increased peril on the ground.\nInstead of the great white flame of electric lights, and the hot\norange of the gas, we have a hundred hues of veiled colour. What\nexactly all the decrees are which produce these rainbows, I do not\nknow; but the effect, particularly on a wet night when the colours are\nreflected on wet wood pavements and asphalte, is perfectly charming,\nand we hope that, in compensation for the multiplied dangers of the\nstreets, we shall be immune from the flames and fumes of incendiary\nand asphyxiating shells. The prudent householder--I am afraid I\nam not one--has had a good deal of pleasant occupation in fitting\nup his cellar as a place to flee unto when we are threatened with\nZeppelins, and one night, shortly after my return, I had the pleasure\nof inspecting one of these. It lay deep in the bowels of the earth,\nand if the absence of air would not asphyxiate you, I am sure its\nrefugees need fear no other cause of suffocation. There were several\ndeck-chairs, and at a slightly withdrawn distance a serviceable wooden\nform on which the servants would sit, while the bombardment was going\non, in a respectful row. There was a spirit-lamp on which to make\ntea, a tin of highly nutritious biscuits, and a variety of books to\nread by the light of electric torches. Upstairs the same thoroughness\nprevailed. Nightly, on retiring to bed, the lady of the house had\non a table close at hand a bag containing the most valuable of her\njewellery, and a becoming dressing-gown much padded. Her husband's\nZeppelin suit, the sort of suit you might expect to find in opulent\nEsquimaux houses, lay on another chair, and outside in the hall was a\nlarge washing basin filled with some kind of soda-solution, and on the\nrim of it, hung like glasses on the top of a punch-bowl, were arranged\nhalf a dozen amazing masks, goggle-eyed and cotton-wooled, which, on\nthe first sign of an asphyxiating bomb, would be dipped in the solution\nof soda and tied over the face. To provide against incendiary bombs\nthere was a pail of sand and a pail of water at every corner, while\nbelow the cellar beckoned a welcome in case of explosions. Given\na moment for preparation, this house was a fortress against which\nZeppelins might furiously rage together without hurting anybody.\nWhether they sought to suffocate or to burn, or to blow to atoms, this\nthoughtful householder was prepared for any of their nasty tricks.\n\nAll this was perfectly entrancing to my flippant mind, and after\ndinner, when the servants had washed up, we had, at my particular\nrequest, a rehearsal of the Zeppelin game to see how it all worked. The\nservants and my host and hostess retired to their respective bedrooms,\nand we put out all the lights. As guest, I had no duty assigned to me,\nI was just going to be a passenger in the Ark of safety, so I remained\nin the hall. When I judged I had given them enough time to lie fairly\ndown on their beds, I sounded the gong with great vigour, which denoted\nthat a Zeppelin had begun dropping bombs in the neighbourhood. Then the\nhouse responded splendidly: in an incredibly short space of time my\nhostess came out of her room, with the bag containing the regalia in\nher hand, and her beautiful padded dressing-gown on; my host came from\nhis with the Esquimaux suit over his dress-clothes--looking precisely\nlike Tweedledum arrayed for battle--and the servants, with shrill\ngiggles, waited near the basin of soda-solution. Then we all put on\nmasks (there was one to spare, which was given me), and, omitting the\nceremony of dipping them in the soda, my host caught up the basin,\nand we all trooped downstairs into the cellar. The servants plumped\nthemselves down on the bench, we sat in the deck-chairs, and there we\nall were. The time from the sounding of the gong to the moment when\nthe cellar door was banged, and we were safe from explosives and\nasphyxiating bombs, was just three minutes and five seconds. The only\nthing unprovided for was the event of the Zeppelin dropping incendiary\nbombs after we had all gone into the Ark, for in that case the house\nwould be burned above us, and we should be slowly roasted. But that\ncruel contingency we settled to disregard. It would be the kind of bad\nluck against which it is hopeless to take precautions. So then, as it\nwas a hot evening, my host took off his Zeppelin suit again, and after\ntesting the nutritive biscuits, which were quite delicious, we went\nupstairs again with shouts of laughter. No doubt their provision had\na solid base of reason, for it certainly would be very annoying to be\nasphyxiated in your room, when such simple arrangements as these would\nhave resulted in your having a cup of tea in the comfortable cellar\ninstead; but there was this added bonus of sport about it all. It was\nthe greatest fun.\n\nThis house where I had been dining was in the neighbourhood of Bedford\nSquare, and I left about half-past ten, with the intention of walking\nas far as Charing Cross, and there embarking on the underground. I had\nhardly gone a hundred yards from the house, when on to the quiet night\nthere came a report so appalling that it seemed like some catastrophic\nnoise heard in a dream. It was quite close to me, somewhere on the\nleft, and I ran as hard as I could round the corner of a block of\nhouses to be able to look eastwards, for there was no doubt in my mind\nthat a Zeppelin, nearly overhead, had dropped a bomb. Before I got to\nthe corner there was another report as loud as the first, and, looking\nup, I saw that the searchlights, like pencils of light, were madly\nscribbling about over the sky. Suddenly one caught the Zeppelin, then\nanother, and next moment it was in the meeting focus of half a dozen\nof them, hanging high above my head, serene and gilded with the rays\nof light, a fairy creation of the air. Then began the sound of guns,\none shell exploded in front of it, another far below it. Disregarding\nall the regulations for their protection, people ran out of their\nhouses, and, like me, stood gaping up at it, for the excitement of it\nwas irresistible. I noticed that one man near me put up the collar\nof his coat whenever there was a loud explosion, just as if a slight\nshower was falling, and then quite gravely and seriously put it down\nagain. Others stepped into porches, or flattened themselves against\nthe walls, but none did as they were told by the police regulations.\nA special constable was there too, who should have herded us all into\ncover; instead, he stared with the rest, and put the lighted end of his\ncigarette into his mouth. For, indeed, this was not a thing you could\nsee every day, a Zeppelin hanging above you, and the shells from guns\nin London exploding round it. It fired the imagination; here was the\nReal Thing, which we had been reading about for a year and never seen.\nThe air had been invaded by the enemy, and guns in the heart of the\nsecurest city in the world were belching shells at it.\n\nThen came the end of this amazing sight: a shell burst close to that\nserene swimmer, and it stuck its nose in the air, and ascending with\nextraordinary speed, like a bubble going upwards through water, got out\nof the focus of searchlights and disappeared.\n\nBy this time the eastern horizon was glowing with a light that grew\nsteadily more vivid. The airship had dropped incendiary bombs in the\nCity, and fire-engines were racing along Oxford Street, with gleam\nof helmets, clanging of bells and hoarse shouts from the firemen.\nBut there was no getting near the seat of the fire, for a cordon of\npolice had closed all streets near it, and I walked homewards along\nthe Embankment, with eyes fixed on the sky, and cannoning into other\npassengers, because I did not look where I was going, as you may see\nladies doing when they gaze in a hypnotized manner into hat-shops, as\nthey walk along the street.\n\nApart from the actual thrill of the adventure, there was a most\ninteresting psychological point, which I considered as I went\nhomewards. There were we, the crowd in the street, just average folk,\njust average cowards in the face of danger, and not one, as far as\nI could see, gave a single thought to the risk of dropped bombs or\nfalling pieces of shrapnel. We might any or all of us be wiped out next\nmoment, but we didn't care, not in the least because we were brave, but\nbecause the interest of what was happening utterly extinguished any\nother feeling. Probably the majority of the crowd had passed gloomy and\nuncomfortable moments imagining that very situation, namely, of having\na murderous Zeppelin just above them; but when once the murderous\nZeppelin was there, they all forgot it was murderous, and were merely\ninterested in the real live Zeppelin. Just in the same way, in minute\nmatters, we all find that ringing the dentist's bell is about the worst\npart of the tiresome business.\n\nThe sequel as concerns the house in which I had dined so few hours\nbefore delighted me when I was told it next day. I suppose the\nrealistic character of our rehearsal preyed on the servants' minds,\nfor they groped their way downstairs to the cellar in the dark, and\nnone thought to turn on the electric light. My hostess picked up\nher jewel-case and groped her way after them, forgetting about the\nsoda-solution and the masks, and my host threw open the window and\ngazed ecstatically at the Zeppelin till it vanished. Then he turned on\nthe lights and fetched his household back from the cellar, since the\nraid was over.... It is but another instance of how, when faced with a\nsituation, we diverge from the lines of conduct we have so carefully\nlaid down for ourselves. I once knew a family that practised fire-drill\nvery industriously in case that one day there might be an outbreak in\nthe house. There were patent extinguishers to put it out with, and\nropes to let yourself out of window all over the place, and everyone\nknew exactly what he was to do. Then the opportunity so long expected\ncame, and a serious outbreak occurred. On which the owner forgot\neverything that he had learned himself and taught everybody else, and\nafter throwing a quantity of his valuable Oriental china on to the\nstone terrace, he performed prodigies of single-handed valour in saving\na very old piano which nobody wanted at all.... (I think this pathetic\nstory contradicts my theory about the calmness of the crowd on the\nZeppelin night, but who wants to be consistent?)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had arrived this September at a break in the lease of my house, and\nsix months before (see page two of the lease in question) I had given\nnotice to the owner in writing that I should evacuate. Consequently for\nthe last few months I had been an assiduous frequenter of house-agents'\noffices, and the God of addition sums alone knows how many houses I\nhad seen over from garret to basement. The extraordinary thing about\nall these was that they were all exceptional bargains, such as the\nagent had never before known, and that in almost every case another\ngentleman was in negotiation for them. In spite of that, however,\nif I chose at once and firmly to offer the price asked, there was a\nstrong probability of my securing one of these marvellous bargains,\nand thwarting the ambitions of the other gentleman. This opportunity\nto thwart the other gentleman was certainly an appeal to the more\nvillainous side of human nature, and often, if a house seemed to me\nthe sort of habitation I was on the look-out for, the thought of the\nother gentleman getting it was an incentive to take it myself. But\nnever before did I realize how hopelessly traditional is that section\nof the human race which designs our houses for us. The type, in the\nmodest species of abode I was looking for, never varied. There was a\nnarrow passage inside the front door, with a dining-room and a back\nroom opening out of it, and a staircase up to the first floor, where\nlay two sitting-rooms, invariably knocked into one. There was a bath\non a half-landing, there were front bedrooms and back bedrooms higher\nup, all exactly alike, and for a long time I looked in vain for any\nhouse that was not precisely like any other house. In fact, this became\na _sine qua non_ with me, and ceasing to care whether I thwarted the\nother gentleman or not, I think if I had found a house where the\nbath-room was in the basement, or there was no staircase, so that you\nhad to go upstairs in a basket with a rope, I should have taken it. I\nalmost despaired of finding what I wanted, and thought of revoking,\nif possible, my notice of quitting, for in my present house there is\nsomething which is not quite like other houses, for some inspired\ntenant threw down the wall between the dining-room and the entrance\npassage, making a sort of hall of it, in the middle of which I dine.\nThat there are inconveniences attaching to it I don't deny, for the\nguest sitting nearest the front door occasionally jumps out of his skin\nwhen the postman thunders with the evening post close by his ear; but\nthe house isn't quite like other houses of its type, which is precisely\nthe reason why ten years ago I took it.\n\nWith a pocket full of \"orders to view,\" and plenty of shillings for\nthe patient caretakers who mournfully conducted me over their charge,\nI used on most days to set out on these explorations after lunch,\nreturning discouraged at tea-time. I could not see myself in any of the\nhouses I saw, or imagine going to sleep in any of those front bedrooms,\nor spending the evening in the back-room behind the dining-room, or in\nthe two sitting-rooms knocked into one. But then, though it lingered\nlong, came the Mecca of my quest. Even at the front door I had some\npremonition of success, for the knocker was not like other knockers,\nand when the door opened, I saw, with a beating heart, that the\nstaircase was not like other staircases. Some four feet from the ground\nit turned at right angles towards where the dreadful little back room\nshould be. It couldn't go into the door of the little back room, or\nif it did, it would be very odd. You would have to pass through the\ndining-room in order to get to the bottom of the staircase.... Then\nadvancing I saw: the staircase turned into a little hall (originally,\nno doubt, the dreadful little back room). Beyond lay a broad passage,\nand the dining-room was built out at the end. Through the open door\nof it I saw the windows looking out, not on to a street at all, but\non to full-foliaged trees that grew in a disused graveyard. Between\nit and the house ran a way for foot-passengers only. Something in my\nbrain exulted, crying out \"This is it!\" and simultaneously I felt a\nsoft stroking on my shin. Looking down I saw a grave black cat rubbing\nagainst me. Was there ever such an omen? I had already settled in my\nmind that this must be the house intended for me (it was), and here was\nthe bringer of good luck congratulating me on my discovery.\n\nI made the usual grand tour, but in how different a mood, and as I\nmounted my spirits rose ever higher. In front was a square (so-called\nthough it was an oblong) closed at the top end where my house was\nsituated, so that no traffic came through it, and at the back was this\nbig graveyard, with its church, and the dome of the Brompton Oratory\n(concealment is useless) rising over its shoulder like the Salute at\nVenice. Literally not a house was in sight; there was but the faintest\nsound of traffic from the Brompton Road; I might have been a country\nparson in his vicarage. I went straight to the house-agent's, made an\noffer, and didn't care one atom whether I thwarted anybody or not.\nNaturally I hoped I did, but it made no difference.\n\nA little genteel chaffering ensued, for I felt so certain that I was\ngoing to live in that house, that I felt I was running no risks, and in\na week it was mine, with possession at this quarter-day of September.\nThen having got my desire, I began to feel regretful about the house I\nwas leaving. I had spent ten jolly years in it, and now for the first\ntime I became aware how I had taken root there, how our tendrils, those\nof the house and of me, had got intertwined. The roots consisted of\nall kinds of memories, some sad, some pleasant, some ludicrous, but\nall dear. I was digging myself up like a plant, and these fibres had\nto be disentangled, for I could not bear to break them. For though\nmemories are immaterial things, they knit themselves into rooms or\ngardens, the scenes where they were laid, and those scenes become part\nof them and they of those scenes. Just as a house where some deed of\nhorror has been done retains for sensitives some impression of it, and\nwe say the house is haunted, so even for those who are not sensitives\nin this psychical sense the rooms they have lived in, where there has\nbeen the talk and laughter of those they have loved, and maybe lost,\nhave got knit into them, and must be treated tenderly if parting comes.\nAnd I imagined, when I came home after definitely settling to leave\nthis month, that the house knew about it, and looked at me with silent\nreproach. For we had suited each other very well, we had been very\nfriendly and happy together, and now I was deserting the home in the\nmaking of which we had both been ingredients, and the spirit of the\nhouse I was betraying was full of mute appeal. It did not want to be\nleft alone, or, still worse, to be mated with people who did not suit\nit. But what could I do? I was going away; there was no doubt about\nthat, and I could hardly give it a present of fresh paint or paper some\nof its rooms to please it. That would have been ridiculous. But I would\nleave it all the bulbs I had planted year by year in the garden. There\nwould be a great show of them next spring.... Poor dear little old\nhouse!\n\nI had got possession of my new house \"as from\" (this is legal\nphraseology, and means \"on\") the first of September, when the front\ndoor-key was given me; and thus I had four weeks for decoration,\nand took a header into the delightful sea of paints and papers and\ndistempers. The most altruistic of friends, whom I will call Kino\n(which has something to do with his name but not much), vowed himself\nto me for the whole of that month, to give advice in the matter of\ncolours, and not to mind if I rejected it, to come backwards and\nforwards for ever and ever from one house to the other, with a pencil,\na memorandum-book and a yard measure incessantly in his pocket. For\nwhen you go into a new house you have to measure all that you possess\nto see if it fits. It never does, but you can't help believing it is\ngoing to. You have to measure curtains and curtain rods to see where\nthey will go (the idea of leaving a lovely brass curtain rod behind was\nan idea before which my happiness shrivelled like a parched scroll);\nyou have to measure brass stair-rods and count them; you have to\nmeasure blinds, and carpets and rugs and grand pianos and beds and\ntables and cupboards. Then with the dimensions written down in Kino's\nmemorandum-book, we hurried across to the new house, and measured the\nheights of rooms by tying the tape on to the end of a walking-stick,\nand the spaces between the eyelets on stairs which in favourable\ncircumstances retain the carpet rods in place, the widths of recesses,\ncomparing them with the measurements of the articles we hoped to\nestablish there. Also with sinkings of the heart I surreptitiously\ntook the size of an awkward angle of the staircase (up which my grand\npiano must pass), and came to the conclusion that it wouldn't. I said\nnothing about it to Kino, because it is no use to anticipate trouble.\nBut later in the day, when we were back in Oakley Street again, I came\nunexpectedly into the drawing-room and caught _him_ measuring the\npiano. Of course I pretended not to see.\n\nThe previous tenant of the new house had taken away most of the\nfixtures, but was willing to leave certain degraded blinds, which on\nmy side I did not want. On the other hand, I had not long ago got a\nquantity of new blinds for my old house, which I should have liked to\nuse if possible, and the question of blinds became a nightmare. I had\nbefore now deplored the awful uniformity of architects in matters of\nbuilding; now I raged over their amazing irregularities with regard\nto windows. In an insane anxiety for originality, they seemed to make\nevery window of a different size; my drawing-room blinds were three\ninches too narrow for my new drawing-room, and two inches too broad for\nthe front bedroom. Then Kino would have a marvellous inspiration, and,\nrunning downstairs, discovered that the hall window was of precisely\nthe same width as the drawing-room windows in the old house, so that\na home was found for one of the blinds. So he measured all the other\nwindows in the new house, to find a home for the other drawing-room\nblind. Then we lost the measurements of the windows in my old bedroom,\nand I went back to Oakley Street, to measure these again and telephone\nthe dimensions to him. On going to the telephone \"the intermittent\nbuzzing sound\" awaited me, and after agitating discussions between\nme and the exchange, I found that Kino was simultaneously ringing\nme up to say he had found the list in question, and by a wonderful\nstroke of good luck my bedroom blinds fitted the back bedroom on the\nsecond floor. There was only one window there, so we had left over (at\npresent) one drawing-room blind and one bedroom blind.... That night\nI dreamed that Kino was dead, and that I, as undertaker, was trying\nto fit a bedroom blind on to him as a shroud; but his feet, shod in\nWellington boots, protruded, and I cut a piece off the dining-room\nblind to cover them up.\n\nBut through all these disturbances the work of painting and\ndistempering went swiftly on, and the house began to gleam with the\ncolours I loved. For a mottled wall-paper in the hall and passage\nwhich resembled brawn that had seen its best days, there shone a blue\nin which there met the dark velvet of the starry sky and the flare\nof the Italian noon. Black woodwork with panels of white framed the\nwindow, and of black and white was the staircase; a yellow ceiling made\nsunshine in the dining-room. The drawing-room was fawn-grey, and on the\nblack floor would gleam the sober sunsets of Bokhara; even blinds that\nwould not fit and brass curtain-rods that there was no use for had, so\nto speak, a silver lining. Marvellous to relate, there seemed every\nprospect of the work being finished by the twenty-ninth of the month,\nand with an optimism pathetically misplaced, I supposed that it was the\nsimplest thing in the world to put the furniture of a small house into\na larger one. I knew exactly where everything was to go; what could\nbe simpler than with a smiling face to indicate to the workmen the\nposition of each article as it emerged from the van? It is true that\nthe thought of the grand piano still occasionally croaked raven-like in\nmy mind, but I pretended, like Romeo, that it was only the nightingale.\n\nI suppose everybody, however lightly enchained to possessions, has\nsome few objects of art (or otherwise) to which he is profoundly\nattached. In my case there were certain wreaths and festoons of gilded\nwood-carving by Kent, and before the actual move took place, Kino and\nI had a halcyon day in fixing these up to the walls of the blue hall,\nwhere they would be safe from the danger of having wardrobes and other\ntrifles dumped down on them. So on a certain Sunday we set off from\nOakley Street in a taxicab piled high with these treasures and with\nhammer and nails, and with a bottle of wine, sandwiches of toast and\nchicken, apples and two kitchen chairs. Disembarking with care, we\nate the first meal in the house, and did not neglect a most important\nceremony, that of making friends with the Penates, or gods of the home,\nwho, like my _strega_ in Alatri and the fairies of _Midsummer Night's\nDream,_ police the passages when all are asleep and drive far from the\nhouse all doubtful presences. There on the earth we made burnt offering\nof the crumbs of chicken sandwiches and apple-rind, building an oven of\nthe paper in which our lunch was wrapped, and at the end pouring on the\nashes a libation from the bottle of wine. All was right that day; the\nnails went smoothly home into the walls, we did not hammer our fingers,\nand the gold wreaths arranged themselves as by magic.\n\nThe great manoeuvre began next day, when at an early hour the vans\narrived to begin taking my furniture. That day they moved dispensable\nthings, leaving the apparatus of bedrooms, which was to be transferred\non the morrow, at the close of which I was to sleep in the new house.\nDining-room furniture went on the first day, and when I came back\nthat evening to sleep in the old house for the last time, I found it\ndishevelled and mournful. Canvas-packing strewed the floor, pictures\nwere gone, and on the walls where they had hung were squares and\noblongs of unfaded paper. The beauty and the amenity of the house were\ndeparted; I felt as if I had been stripping the robes off it, and its\nspirit shivering and in rags went silently with me as I visited the\ndenuded rooms, with eyes of silent reproach. I was taking away from it\nall that it had reckoned as its own; to-morrow I, too, should desert\nit, and it would stand lonely and companionless. Never in those ten\nyears had it been so pleasant to live with as in that last week; it\nwas as if it were putting forth shy advances, making itself so kind\nand agreeable, in order to detain the tenants with whom it had passed\nsuch happy years. One by one I turned out the lights, and its spirit\nfollowed me up to my bedroom. But to-night it would not come in, and\nwhen I entered the sense of home was gone from my room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll next day the chaos in the new house grew more and more abysmal\nas the vans were unloaded. The plan of putting everything instantly\nand firmly into its place failed to come off; for how could you put\nanything firmly or otherwise into the dining-room when for two hours\nthe refrigerator blocked access to it? Meantime books were stacked on\nthe floor, layers of pictures leaned against the walls; the hall got\npacked with tables and piles of curtains, and finally, about five of\nthe afternoon, arrived the grand piano. The foreman gave but one glance\nat the staircase, and declared that it was quite impossible for it to\ngo up, and pending some fresh plan for its ascension, it must needs\nstop in the hall too, where it stood on its side like the coffin of\nsome enormous skate. By making yourself tall and thin you could just\nget by it.\n\nTrouble increased; soon after nightfall a policeman rang at the door\nto tell me I had an unshaded light in a front room. So I had, and,\nabjectly apologizing, I explained the circumstance and quenched the\nlight. Hardly had he gone, when another came and said I had a very\nbright light in a back room. That seemed to be true also, and since\nthere were neither blinds nor curtains in that room, where I was\ntrying to produce some semblance of order, my labours there must be\nabandoned. But the more we tidied, the more we attempted to put pieces\nof furniture into their places, the worse grew the confusion, and the\nmore the floors got carpeted with china and pictures and books. It was\nas when you eat an artichoke, and, behold, the more you eat, the higher\non your plate rises the d\u00c3\u00a9bris.\n\nAbout midnight Kino went home; the servants had gone to bed, and I was\nalone in this nightmare of unutterable confusion. Till one I toiled on,\nwondering why I had ever left the old house, where the spirit of home\nwas now left lonely. No spirit of home had arrived here yet, and I did\nnot wonder. But just before I went to bed I visited the kitchen to see\nhow they had been getting on downstairs, and for a moment hope gleamed\non the horizon. For sitting in the middle of the best dinner-service,\nwhich was on the floor, was Cyrus, my blue Persian cat, purring loudly.\nHis topaz eye gleamed, and he rose up, clawing at the hay as I entered.\nHe liked the new house; he thought it would suit him, and came upstairs\nwith me, arching his back and rubbing himself against the corners.\n\n\n\n\nOCTOBER, 1915\n\n\nFor two days the grand piano remained on its side at the bottom of the\nstairs, while furniture choked and eddied round it, as when a drain\nis stopped up and the water cannot flow away. It really seemed that\nit would stop there for ever, and that the only chance of playing it\nagain involved being strapped into a chair, and laid sideways on the\nfloor. Eventually the foreman of the removal company kindly promised\nto come back next morning, take out the drawing-room window, and sling\nthe creature in. This would require a regiment of men, and the sort of\ntackle with which thirteen-inch guns are lifted into a ship. He hoped\n(he could go no further than that) that the stone window ledge would\nstand the strain; I hoped so too. My wits, I suppose, were sharpened\nby this hideous prospect, and I telephoned to the firm who had made\nthe piano to send down three men and see if they concurred in the\nimpossibility of getting the piano upstairs except _via_ the doubtful\nwindow-ledge. In half an hour they had taken it up the staircase\nwithout touching the banisters or scratching the wall.\n\nMagically, as by the waving of a wand, the constipation on the\nground-floor was relieved; it was as if the Fairy Prince (in guise\nof three sainted piano-movers) had restored life to the house. The\ntables and chairs danced into their places; bookshelves became peopled\nwith volumes; the china clattered nimbly into cupboards, and carpets\nunrolled themselves on the stairs. There was dawn on the wreck, and\nKino and I set to work on the great scheme of black and white floor\ndecoration which was destined to embellish in a manner unique and\nsurprising the whole of the ground-floor.\n\nLinoleum was the material of it, an apotheosis of linoleum. Round the\nwalls of the passages, the hall, the front room, were to run borders\nof black and white, with panels in recesses, enclosing a chess-board\nof black and white squares. Roll after roll of linoleum arrived, and\nwith gravers we cut them up, and tacked down the borders and the panels\nand the chess-board with that admirable and headless species of nail\nknown as \"little brads.\" The work was not noiseless like the building\nof the Temple of Solomon, but when it was done, my visitors were indeed\nQueens of Sheba, for no more spirit was left in them when on their\nblinded eyes there dawned the glories of the floors that were regular\nand clean as marble pavements, and kind to the tread. No professional\nhand was permitted to assist in these orgies of decoration; two\ninspired amateurs did it all, and one of them did about twenty times\nas much as the other. (The reader may form his own conclusion as to\nwhether modesty or the low motive of seeking credit where the credit\nbelongs to another prompts my reticence on this point.) Then there\nwere wonderful things to be done with paint (and I really did a good\ndeal of that); ugly tiles were made beautiful with shining black, that\nmost decorative of all hues when properly used, and in one room the\nsplendour given to a door and a chimneypiece put Pompeii in its proper\nplace for ever. And all the time, as we worked, and put something of\nhuman personality into the house, the spirit of home was peeping in at\nwindows shyly, tentatively, or hiding behind curtains, or going softly\nabout the pleasant passages, till at last one evening, as we finished\nsome arrangement of books in the front-room, I was conscious that it\nhad come to stay. It did not any longer shrink from observation or\nwithdraw itself when it thought I got a glimpse of it. It stood boldly\nout, smiling and well pleased, and next day, when I woke for a moment\nin the hour before dawn, with sparrow-twitters in the trees outside,\nit was in my room, and I turned over contentedly and went to sleep\nagain. Was it that the disconsolate ghost in Oakley Street had come\nhere, transferring itself from the empty shell? Had it followed, like a\ndeserted cat, the familiar furniture, and the familiar denizens? Or had\na new spirit of home been born? Certainly the conviction that the house\nhad found itself, that it had settled down to an incarnate plane again\nwas no drowsy fantasy of the night; for in the morning, when I went\ndownstairs, the whole aspect of things had changed. I knew I was _chez\nmoi,_ instead of just carrying on existence in some borrowed lodging.\n\nThat morning an enormous letter, chiefly phonetic, arrived from\nSeraphina. It was difficult to read, because when Seraphina wished to\nerase a word, she had evidently smudged her finger over the wet ink,\nand written something on top of it. At first I felt as bewildered as\nKing Belshazzar, when on the wall there grew the inconjecturable doom;\nbut since I had no Daniel in fee, I managed, by dint of trying again\nand again, to make out the most of her message. She relapsed sometimes\ninto the dialect of Alatri, but chiefly she stuck to the good old plan,\nrecommended by Mr. Roosevelt, of putting down the letters like which\nthe word, when spoken, would sound. But by dint of saying it aloud, I\ncaught the gist of it all. No word had come from Alatri since Francis's\nreturn, and even as I read the glamour of that remote existence grew\nround me.\n\nShe had written before, she said, both to Signorino Francesco and to\nme, but she supposed that the letters had gone wrong, for they said\nthe Government soaked off the stamps from the envelopes and sold them\nagain. But that was all right; they wanted every penny they could get\nto spend against the devil-Austrians. _Dio!_ What tremendous battles!\nHow the gallant Italian boys were sweeping them out of the Trentino!\nAnd Goriza had fallen twenty times already. Surely it must have fallen\nby now. And there was the straight road to Trieste....\n\nThe flame of war had set Alatri alight; there was scarce a man of\nmilitary age left on the island, except the soldiers who from time to\ntime were quartered there. The price of provisions was hideous, but\nthrifty folk had planted vegetables in their gardens, and if God said\nthat only the rich might have meat, why, the poor would get on very\nwell without. She herself had planted nutritious beans in the broad\nflower-bed, as soon as the flowers were over, as she had said in her\nprevious letter (not received), and already she had made good soup from\nthem, since Signorino Francesco had told her to use garden produce for\nherself. But Signora Machonochie had come to borrow some beans, and, as\nthe beans belonged to the Signori, Seraphina wished for permission to\ngive her them, since they would otherwise be dried, and make good soup\nagain when the Signori returned. For herself--_scusi_--she thought the\nSignora Machonochie was a good soul (though greedy), for she was always\nmaking mittens for the troops on the snow of the frontier against the\nwinter-time, and went about the roads perpetually knitting, so that\none day she, not looking where she was going, charged into Ludovico's\nmanure cart, and was much soiled. So, if it was our wish that she\nshould have some beans, she should have them, but there would be fewer\nbottles in the store-room.\n\nThen Seraphina became more of a friend, less of a careful housekeeper.\nShe continued:\n\n        \"The house expects your excellencies' dear presence\n        whenever you can return. All the rooms are like Sunday\n        brooches: there is no speck of dust. Pasqualino has been\n        gone this long time, for as soon as we went to war\n        with the stinking beasts, up he goes to the military\n        office, and swears on the Holy Book that he is just\n        turned nineteen, and has come to report himself to the\n        authorities. Of course, they looked him out in their\n        register, and he was but eighteen, but he confessed\n        his perjury when it was no longer any use to deny it,\n        and they were not displeased with him, nor did he go\n        to prison, as happened to Luigi. But they wanted young\n        fellows for the Red Cross who look after the wounded,\n        and, after many prayers, Pasqualino was permitted, in\n        spite of his perjury, to go and serve. Gold buttons, no\n        less, on his jacket; so smart he looked; and there was\n        Caterina smiling and crying all in one, and she gulped\n        and kissed him, and kissed him again and gulped, and\n        for all the world she was as proud of him as the priest\n        on Sunday morning, and would not have had him stay. She\n        came up here to help in the house, and it is all for\n        love of Pasqualino, for once I offered her some _soldi_\n        for the help she had given me in dusting, and she just\n        smacked my hand, and the _soldi_ fell out, and we kissed\n        each other, for then I understood; and she asked to go\n        to Pasqualino's room and sat on the bed, and looked at\n        his washstand, and stroked the coat he had left behind.\n        Oh, I understand young hearts, Signor, for all that I\n        am old, and I left her alone there, and presently she\n        came down again and told me her trouble. It was the\n        night before he went, and your excellency must not think\n        hardly of him or her. _Scusi,_ if I give advice, but\n        they were young, and did not think, for you do not\n        think when you are young, and they are beautiful, both\n        of them, and when they are beautiful, who can wonder?\n        She knows he will marry her, and, indeed, Alatri knows\n        it too, and thus the _bambino_ will not be blackened.\n        Pasqualino is a good boy, and in spite of it, she wanted\n        him to go for the sake of the wounded, thinking nothing\n        of herself and the little one within her. Alatri will be\n        blind to the _bambino,_ and wait for him to make it all\n        right.\n\n        \"Eh, what a pen I have, for it runs on like a tap! All\n        this last month I have been writing a little every day,\n        and now it is nearly finished. But still I think the\n        Signor would like to hear of Teresa of the Cake-shop.\n        There was never such a wonder; it was like a miracle.\n        Suddenly she would have no more of the cake-shop, but\n        must needs go to Naples, and learn to be a nurse, and\n        look after the wounded, as Pasqualino had done. Never,\n        as the Signor knows, had she gone down to the Marina\n        since fifteen years ago (or is it sixteen?), when she\n        went to meet her _promesso,_ Vincenzo Rhombo, who had\n        come back from Buenos Ayres, and even as he landed on\n        the Marina, was stricken in her very arms with the\n        cholera and died that day. Never since then had Teresa\n        gone to the Marina, whatever was the _festa_ or the\n        fireworks; but now nothing would serve her but that\n        she must go to help in the war. She had money, for the\n        cake-shop had done well all these years, and she must\n        needs go and spend her money in learning nursing in\n        Naples. All of a sudden it was so with her, and one\n        day a month ago she asked me to come down with her to\n        see her forth. And when we came to the Marina, Signor,\n        she shut her eyes, for she could not bear to see it,\n        and asked me to lead her along the quay to where the\n        boats took off the passengers by the steamer. All along\n        the quay I led her, she with eyes closed; but when we\n        came to the steps, where Vincenzo had landed and fell\n        into her arms a stricken man, then at last she opened\n        her eyes, or the tears opened them, and she fell on\n        her knees and kissed the place where Vincenzo had been\n        joined to her. She kissed it, and she kissed it, and\n        then suddenly her tears dried, and she stepped into\n        the boat and waved her hand to her friends and said:\n        'Vincenzo wishes it; Vincenzo wishes it.' Oh, a brave\n        woman! she had not baked her heart in the cake-shop.\n\n        \"My humble duty to you, excellency, Seraphina has no\n        more to say, but that often the step goes up and down\n        in the studio. I think, as Donna Margherita said, that\n        someone guards the house. It is as a sentry, who makes\n        the house secure. But it will be a good day when I hear\n        there the steps of the Signorino and of you. All humble\n        compliments and the good wishes of a friend who is\n        Seraphina.\n\n        \"_Scusi!_ Shall I sow the flower seeds in the garden\n        that were saved from last year? If the Signori will\n        not be here in the spring, what need to sow them, for\n        they will keep, will they not? But if there is a chance\n        of your coming, the garden must needs be gay with a\n        welcome.\"\n\nRight in the middle of the black cloud of war there came a rift, as I\nread Seraphina's budget of news. Some breeze parted the folds of it,\nand I saw a peep of blue sky and bluer sea, and the stone-pine and\nthe terraced gardens, with the morning-glory rioting on the wall. But\nhow incredibly remote it seemed, as if it belonged to some previous\ncycle of existence; as if the closed doors of eternity that swing\nshut when we are born had opened again, and I looked on some previous\nincarnation. I thought I remembered (before the war came) experiences\nlike those which Seraphina's letter suggested, but they seemed like\nthe affairs of childhood, when imagination is so mixed up with reality\nthat we scarcely know whether there are robbers in the shrubbery or\nnot. We pretend that there are, and even while we pretend dusk falls\nand the shrubbery has to be passed, and we are not certain whether\nthere are not robbers there, after all. It was so with the recollection\nof the things of which Seraphina spoke (and even they were mixed up\nwith war). I felt I might have dreamed them, or have invented them for\nmyself, or have experienced them in some pre-natal existence. Just\nthat one glimpse I had of them, and no more; then the rift in the\nclouds closed up again, and blacker than ever before, except perhaps\nduring the days of the Retreat from Mons, grew the gigantic bastion\nof storm through which we had to pass.... Even so once, thunderclouds\ncollected before me when I was on the top of an Alpine peak, gathering\nand growing thicker with extraordinary swiftness. A rent came in them\nfor a moment, and through it we could see the pastures and villages ten\nthousand feet below. Then it closed up, and we had to pass through the\nclouds out of which already the lightning was leaping before we could\narrive on the safe familiar earth again.\n\nI could scarcely realize, then, what life was like before the war,\nand now, looking forward, it seemed impossible to imagine that there\ncould be any end to the murderous business. This month a wave of\npessimism swept over London; even those who had been most optimistic\nwere submerged in it; and all that was possible was to go on, the more\noccupied the better, and, anyhow, not to talk about it. A dozen times\nhad our hopes flared high; a dozen times they had been extinguished.\n\nOnly a few months ago we had seen the advance of the Russian armies\nthrough Galicia, and had told each other that the relentless\nsteam-roller had begun its irresistible progress across the Central\nEmpires, leaving them flattened out and ground to powder in its wake.\nBut now, instead of their being flattened out in its wake, it appeared\nthat they had only been concentrated and piled high in front of it,\nfor now the billow of the enemies' armies, poised and menacing, had\nbroken and swept the steam-roller far back on the beach, where now\nit remained stuck in the shingle with quenched furnaces and a heavy\nlist. Przemysl had been retaken; the newly-christened Lvoff had become\nLemberg again; Warsaw had fallen; Ivangorod had fallen; Grodno and\nVilna had fallen. For the time, it is true, that great billow had spent\nitself, but none knew yet what damage and dislocation had been wrought\non the steam-roller. Russia's friends assured us that the invincible\nresolve of her people had suffered no damage, and expressed their\nunshaken belief in the triumphant march of her destiny. But even the\nmost eloquent preachers of confidence found it difficult to explain\nprecisely on what their confidence was based.\n\nThat was not all, nor nearly all. In the Balkans Bulgaria had\njoined the enemy; the fat white fox Ferdinand had kissed his hand\nto his august brothers in Vienna and Berlin, and soon, when Servia\nhad been crushed, they would meet, and in each other's presence\nconfirm the salutation, and be-Kaiser and be-Czar each other. From\none side the Austro-German advance had begun, from the other the\nBulgarian, and it was certain that in a few weeks we should see Servia\nextinguished--exterminated even as Belgium had been. It was useless to\nimagine that all the despairing gallantry of that mountain people could\nstand against the double invasion, or to speak of the resistance in\nthe impregnable mountain passes, which would take months to overcome.\nSuch talk was optimism gone mad, even as in the Retreat from Mons\ncertain incredible tacticians in the Press assured us that this was all\npart of a strategic move, whereby the German lines of communication\nwould be lengthened. Certainly their lines of communication were\nbeing lengthened, for they were pressing the Allies, who were totally\nunable to stand against that first rush, across half France. So now\nonly insane interpreters could give encouraging comments on the news\nfrom Servia. Servia, who had been but a king's pawn to open the savage\ngame that was being played over the length and breadth of Europe, was\ntaken and swept off the board; in a few weeks at the most we should\nsee the power of Germany extending unbroken from Antwerp on the\nWest to Constantinople on the East. Allied to Bulgaria and Turkey,\nwith Servia crushed, the way to the East, should she choose to go\nEastwards, lay open and undefended in front of her. It seemed more than\npossible, too, that Greece, who had invited the troops of the Allies\nto Salonika, would join the triumphant advance of the Central Empires.\nOur diplomacy, as if it had been some card game played by children,\nhad been plucked from our hands and scattered over the nursery table;\nevery chance that had been ours had been thrown on to the rubbish\nheap, and Germany, going to the rubbish heap, had picked up our lost\nopportunities and shown us how to use them. It was impossible (it would\nalso have been silly) to be optimistic over these blunders; the Balkan\nbusiness was going as badly as it possibly could.\n\nThere was worse yet. Before the end of the month no one, unless,\nlike the ostrich, he buried his eyes in the sand and considered that\nbecause he saw nothing there was nothing to see, had any real hope of\na successful issue to the Dardanelles expedition, and it was with an\naching sense of regret that one recalled the brave days when the _Queen\nElizabeth_ went thundering into the Straits, and we were told that but\na mile or two divided us from victory. But what miles! They seemed\nquite sufficient, to divide us, even as when on board ship you are told\nthat only a plank lies between yourself and a watery grave, the plank\nwill do very well indeed to keep off the watery grave. That mile or two\nhad the same stubborn quality; months of valiant endeavour, endless\nsacrifice, and sickening mistakes had not brought us any nearer our\ngoal.\n\nIt was useless to blink these obvious facts, and I found one morning\nthat it would be wiser to sit down and just stare them in the face,\nget used to them, as far as might be, rather than shuffle them out of\nsight, or pretend to see silver linings to clouds which, in spite of\nthe proverb, had not got any. There was a pit of clouds. Somehow that\nmust be explored. It was no use to pretend to put a lid on it, and say\nthere was no such pit. I had to go down into it.\n\nI descended then into this \"black tremendous sea of cloud.\" It was not\nthe invariable daily tale of ill-success in the war that caused it to\nform in my brain, though I suppose it was that which consolidated it.\nIt came like an obsession. I had gone to bed one night with hope of\ngood news next day; I had taken pleasure in my jolly new house! I had\ndined with friends and I slept well. But when I woke the Thing was\nthere. There was no bad news in the paper that morning, but in the\npapers and in my bed, and about my path, and in my breakfast, there\nwas a blackening poison that spread and sprouted like some infernal\nmushroom of plague. I found that I did not care for anything any more;\nthere was the root of this obsession. I thought of the friends I should\npresently meet when I went out to my work, and the thought of them\nroused no feeling of any kind. There was a letter from Francis, saying\nthat in a week's time he would have three days' leave, and proposed\nthat he should spend them with me. There was a letter from Kino, saying\nthat he had found the book which I so much wanted, and would bring it\nround after breakfast, and should we go out, as we had vaguely planned,\nthat afternoon to Kew, and get the country whiff from the flaming\nautumn? Certainly if he liked, thought I, for it does not matter. I did\nnot want to go, nor did I want not to go; it was all one, for over all\nand in all was the blackness of the pit of clouds. We went accordingly,\nand to me his face and his presence were no more than the face and the\npresence of any stranger in the street. He had lost his meaning, he was\nnonsense; it might have been some gesticulating machine that walked by\nme. We looked at the flaring towers of golden and russet leaf, and I\nsaw them as you see something through the wrong end of a telescope. I\nsaw them through glass, through a diving bell. The sun was warm, the\nsky was flecked with the loveliest mackerel scales of cloud; I was\nwith a friend stepping along mossy paths below the beech-trees, and\nwithin me was a centre-point of consciousness that only wailed and\ncried out at the horror of existence. The glory of the autumn day was\nas magnificent as ever; the smell of the earth and the tea-like odour\nof dry leaves had in itself all the sting and thrill that belonged to\nit, and by my side was the friend with whom the laying of linoleum had\nbeen so wonderful a delight, because we laid it together, and I was cut\noff from it all. Everything was no more than dried flowers, sapless,\nbrittle and colourless.\n\nThose days were no more than hours of existence, to which somehow my\nflesh clung, though the fact of existence was just that which was so\ntragic and so irremediable. By occupying myself, by doing anything\ndefinite that required attention, even if it was only acknowledging\nthe receipt of subscriptions, or of writing begging letters on behalf\nof the fund for which I worked, I could cling to the sheer cliff\nand still keep below me that sea of cloud. But the moment that the\nautomatism only of life was wanted, the sea rose and engulfed me again.\nWhen I walked along a street, when I sat down to eat, when, tired with\nconscious effort of the mind, I relaxed attention, it drowned me. The\neffort to keep my head above it was infinitely fatiguing, and when\nat nights, having been unable to find something more to do, however\ntrivial, or when, unable to hold the dam-gate any longer, I went up to\nbed, the nightmare of existence yelled out and smothered me. Huge and\nencompassing, it surged about a pinprick of consciousness which was\nmyself; black wrinkled clouds brooded from zenith to horizon, and I\nknew that beyond the horizon, and to innumerable horizons beyond that,\nthere reached that interminable blackness _in saecula saeculorum._ Or,\nagain, as in some feverish dream, behold, it was I, who just before\nhad been a pinprick in everlasting time and space, who now swelled up\nto infinite dimensions, and was surrounded for ever and ever by gross\nand infinitesimal nothingness. At one moment I was nothing set in the\nmiddle of cosmic darkness; at the next I was cosmic darkness itself,\nset in a microscopic loneliness, an alpha and omega of the everlasting\nmidnight. No footstep fell there, no face looked out from it, neither\nof God nor of devil, nor of human kind. I was alone, as I had always\nbeen alone; here was the truth of it, for it was but a fancy figment\nthat there was a scheme, a connection, a knitting of the members of the\nworld to each other, and of them to God. I had made that up myself; it\nwas but one of the foolish stories that I had often busied myself with.\nBut I knew better now; I was alone, and all was said.\n\nNow there are many who have been through much darker and deeper waters\nthan these, without approaching real melancholia. To the best of my\nbelief I did no more than paddle at the edge of them. Certainly they\nseemed to close over me, except for that one fact that even where they\nwere deepest, any manual or mental act that required definite thought\nwas sufficient for the moment to give me a breath of air. All pleasure,\nand, so it seemed to me, all love had become obscured, but there was\nstill some sense of decency left that prevented me from lying down on\nthe floor, and saying in the Italian phrase, \"_Non po' combattere._\"\nThere was a double consciousness still. I said to myself, \"I give\nup!\" but I didn't act as if I gave up, nor did I tell another human\nsoul that in myself I had done so. I confessed to depression, but\ndidn't talk about it. I wrote a perfectly normal and cordial letter to\nFrancis, saying how welcome he would be, though I felt that there was\nno such person. Still, I wrote to him, and did not seriously expect\nthat my note would be returned through the dead-letter office. And this\nis precisely the reason why I have written these last pages; it is to\nassure all those who know, from inside, what such void and darkness\nmeans, that the one anchor is employment, and the absolute necessity is\nbehaving in a normal manner. It does not seem worth while; it seems,\ntoo, all but impossible, but it is not quite impossible, and there is\nnothing which is so much worth while. Until you actually go over the\nedge, stick to the edge. Do not look down into the abyss, keep your\neyes on such ground as there is, and find something there: a tuft of\ngrass, a fallen feather, the root of a wild plant--and look at it. If\nyou are so fortunate as to discover a little bare root there, something\neasily helped, cover it up with a handful of kindly soil. (You will not\nslip while you are doing this.) If a feather, be sure that some bird\nhas flown over, and dropped it from a sunlit wing; if a tuft of grass,\nthink of the seed from which it came. Besides, if God wills that you go\ndown into Hell, He is there also....\n\nHold on, just hold on. Sometimes you will look back on the edge to\nwhich you clung, and will wonder what ailed you.\n\nIt was so with me. I merely held on till life, with its joys and its\nties, began to steal back into me, even as into a dark room the light\nbegins to filter at dawn. At no one second can you say that it is\nlighter than it was the second before, but if you take a series of\nseconds, you can see that light is in the ascendant. A certain Friday,\nfor instance, had been quite intolerable, but, just as you look out of\nthe window, and say \"It is lighter,\" I found on Saturday that, though\nnothing in the least cheerful had happened in the interval, I didn't\nso earnestly object to existence, while a couple of days later I could\nlook back on Friday and wonder what it had all been about. What it had\nbeen about I do not know now: some minute cell, I suppose, had worked\nimperfectly, and lo! \"the scheme of things entire\" not only seemed,\nbut, I was convinced, was all wrong. Subjective though the disturbance\nwas, it could project itself and poison the world.\n\nTwo things certainly I learned from it, namely, that manual or mental\nemployment, hateful though it is to the afflicted, is less afflicting\nthan idleness; the second, that the more you keep your depression to\nyourself the better. I wish that the infernal pessimists whose presence\nblackens London would learn this. These ravens with their lugubrious\nfaces and their croaking accents, hop obscenely about from house to\nhouse, with a wallet full of stories which always begin, \"They say\nthat--\" and there follows a tissue of mournful prognostications. They\nproject their subjective disturbance, and their tale beginning \"They\nsay that--\" or \"I am told that--\" generally means that Mr. A. and Mr.\nB., having nothing to do, and nothing to think about, have sat by the\nfire and ignorantly wondered what is going to happen. Having fixed on\nthe worst thing, whatever it is, that their bilious imagination can\nsuggest, they go out to lunch, and in accents of woe proceed to relate\nthat \"They say that--\" and state all the dismal forebodings which their\nsolitary meditations have hatched. In fact, the chief reason for which\nI wish that I was a Member of Parliament is that I could then bring\nin a Bill (or attempt to do so) for the Suppression of Pessimists. I\nwould also gladly vote for a Bill that provided for the Suppression of\nExtreme Optimists on the same grounds, namely, that to be told that\nthe Kaiser has cancer, and that the burgesses of Berlin are already\nstarving, leads to a reaction such as the pessimists produce by direct\nmeans. To be told that the Russians are incapable of further resistance\non the authority of \"They say that--\" depresses everybody at once;\nand to be told that there isn't a potato to be had in all Germany\nfor love or money (particularly money) gives rise to an alcoholic\ncheerfulness which dies out and leaves you with a headache of deferred\nhopes. These grinning optimists were particularly hard to bear when\nthe terrible Retreat from Mons was going on, for they screamed with\ndelight at the notion that we were lengthening out the German lines\nof communication, which subsequently would be cut, as by a pair of\nnail-scissors lightly wielded, and the flower of the German army neatly\nplucked like a defenceless wayside blossom. The same smiling idiots\nwere to the fore again during the great Russian retreat, and told us to\nwait, finger on lip, with rapturous eyes, till the Germans had reached\nthe central steppes of Russia, when they would all swiftly expire of\nfrosts, Cossacks and inanition. But, after all, these rose-coloured\nfolk do very little harm; they make us go about our work with a heady\nsense of exhilaration, which, though it soon passes off, is by no means\nunpleasant. At the worst extreme optimists are only fools on the right\nside, whereas pessimists are bores and beasts on the wrong one.\n\nPessimists have had a high old time all this month. They do not exactly\nrejoice when things go ill for us, but misfortune has a certain sour\nsatisfaction for them, because it fulfils what they thought (and\nsaid) in September. Thus now they nod and sigh, and proceed to tell\nus what they augur for November. If only they would keep their misery\nto themselves, nobody would care how miserable they are; but the\ngratuitous diffusion of it is what should be made illegal. For the\nmicrobe of pessimism is the most infectious of bacteria; it spreads\nin such a manner that all decent-minded folk, when they have fallen\nvictims to it, ought surely (on the analogy of what they would do if\nit was influenza) to shut themselves up and refuse to see anybody. But\nbecause the disease is one of the mind, it appears that it is quite\nproper for the sufferer to go and sneeze in other people's faces. There\nought to be a board of moral health, which by its regulations would\nmake it criminal to spread mental disorders, such as pessimism. I had\nso severe an attack of it myself, when the clouds encompassed me, that\nI have a certain right to propose legislation on the subject. Those\nafflicted by the painful disease which, like typhoid, is only conveyed\nthrough the mouth, in terms of articulate speech, should be fined some\nmoderate sum for any speech that was likely to propagate pessimism. If\nthe disease is acute, and the sufferer feels himself in serious danger\nof bursting unless he talks, he would of course be at liberty to shut\nhimself up in any convenient room out of earshot, and talk till he felt\nbetter. Only it should be on his responsibility that his conversation\nshould not be overheard by anybody, and, in suspension of the common\nlaw of England, a wife should be competent to witness against her\nhusband.\n\nIt is not because the ravens are such liars that I complain, for\nlying is the sort of thing that may happen to anybody, but it is the\ndepressing nature of their lies. The famous national outburst of lying\nthat took place over the supposed passage of hundreds of thousands of\nRussians through England on their way to the battle-fields of France\nand Flanders was harmless, inspiriting lying. So, too, the splendid\nmendacity that seized so many of our citizens on the occasion of the\nsecond Zeppelin raid. That ubiquitous airship I verily believe was seen\nhovering over every dwelling-house in London; it hovered in Kensington,\nin Belgravia, in Mayfair, in Hampstead, in Chelsea, and the best of it\nwas that it never came near these districts at all. In fact, it became\na mere commonplace that it hovered over your house, and a more soaring\nbreed of liars arose. One asserted that on looking up he had seen their\nhorrid German faces leaning over the side of the car; another, that the\ncigar-shaped shadow of it passed over his blind. Of course, it passed\nover Brompton Square, on which the Zeppelinians were preparing to\ndrop bombs, thinking that the dome of the Oratory was the dome of St.\nPaul's, and that they had thus a good chance of destroying the Bank of\nEngland. But in the stillness of the night, amid the soft murmurs of\nthe anti-aircraft guns, a guttural voice from above was heard to say,\n\"Nein: das ist nicht St Paul's,\" and the engine of destruction passed\non, leaving us unharmed. Was not that a fortunate thing?\n\nOf course, by the time the Zeppelins began to visit us, we had all had\na good deal of practice in lying, which accounted for the gorgeous\noriental colouring of such amazing imaginings. But the pioneers\nof this great revival of the cult of Ananias, were undoubtedly\nthat multitude whom none can number, who were ready to produce (or\nmanufacture) any amount of evidence to prove that soon after the\noutbreak of the war battalions of Russian troops in special trains,\nwith blinds drawn down, were dashing through the country. It is a\nthousand pities that some serious and industrious historian was not\ncommissioned by his Government to collect the evidence and issue it in\ntabulated form, for it would have proved an invaluable contribution\nto psychology. There was never any first-hand evidence on the subject\n(for the simple reason that the subject had no real existence), but\nthe mass of secondhand evidences went far to prove the non-existent.\nFrom Aberdeen to Southampton there was scarcely a station at which a\nporter had not seen these army corps and told somebody's gardener.\nThe accounts tallied remarkably, the trains invariably had their\nblinds drawn down, and occasionally bearded soldiers peered out of the\nwindows. There was a camp of them on Salisbury Plain, and hundreds of\nEnglishmen who knew no language but their own, distinctly heard them\ntalking Russian to each other. Sometimes stations (as at Reading)\nhad platforms boarded up to exclude the public, and the public from\nneighbouring eminences saw the bearded soldiers drinking quantities of\ntea out of samovars. This was fine imaginative stuff, for the samovar,\nof course, is an urn, and nobody but a Russian, surely, would drink\ntea out of an urn. There was collateral evidence, too: one day the\n_Celtic_ was mined somewhere in the North Sea; she had on board tons of\nammunition and big guns, and for a while the hosts of Russia did not\nappear in the fighting line, because they had remained on Salisbury\nPlain till fresh supplies of ammunition came. Bolder spirits essayed\nhigher flights: At Swindon Station, so the porter told the gardener,\nthey had been seen walking about the platform stamping the snow off\ntheir boots, which proved they had come from far North, where the snow\nis of so perdurable a quality that it travels like blocks of ice from\nNorwegian lakes without apparently melting even in the middle of a\nhot September. Or again, in the neighbourhood of Hatfield the usual\ngardener had heard that a _k\u00c3\u00a9pi_ had been picked up on the road, and\nwhat do you think was the name of the maker printed inside it? Why, the\nleading military outfitter of Nijni-Novgorod! There was glory for you,\nas Humpty-Dumpty said. The gardener fortunately knew who the leading\nmilitary outfitter of Nijni-Novgorod was, while regarded as a proof\nwhat more could anybody want? How could a Russian _k\u00c3\u00a9pi_ have been\ndropped on the North Road unless at least a hundred thousand Russians\nhad been going in special trains through England? I suppose you would\nnot want them _all_ to throw their _k\u00c3\u00a9pis_ away.\n\nThere were hundreds of such stories, none first hand, but overwhelming\nin matter of cumulative secondhand evidence, all springing from\nnowhere but the unassisted brain of ordinary Englishmen. The wish\nwas father to the thought; in the great peril that still menaced the\nFrench and English battle-line, we all wanted hundreds of thousands of\nRussians, and so we said that they were passing through. Some cowardly\nrationalist, I believe, has explained the whole matter by saying that\nsome firm telegraphed that a hundred thousand Russians (whereby he\nmeant Russian eggs) were arriving. I scorn the truckling materialism\nof this. The Russian stories were invented, bit by bit, even as coral\ngrows, by innumerable and busy liars, spurred on by the desire that\ntheir fabrications might be true. Bitter animosities sprang up between\nthose who did and those who did not believe the Russian Saga. Single\nold ladies, to whom the idea that Russia was pouring in to help us was\nvery comforting, altered their wills and cut off faithless nephews,\nand the most stubborn Thomases amongst us were forced to confess that\nthere seemed to be a good deal to say for it, while the fact that the\nWar Office strenuously denied the whole thing was easily accounted for.\nOf course the War Office denied it, for it didn't want the Germans to\nknow. It would be a fine surprise for the Germans on the West Front to\nfind themselves one morning facing serried rows of Russians.... They\nwould be utterly bewildered, for they had been under the impression\nthat Russia was far away East, on the other side of the Fatherland; but\nhere were the Russian armies! They would think their compasses had gone\nmad; they would have been quite giddy with surprise, and have got that\nlost feeling which does so much to undermine the morale of troops. Oh,\na great stroke!\n\nBut all these Russian and Zeppelin Saga were good heady, encouraging\nlies, tonic instead of lowering, like the dejected inventions of\nprostrate pessimists. I do not defend, on principle, the habit of\nmaking up stories and saying that a porter at Reading told your\ngardener; but, given that you are going to do that sort of thing, I do\nmaintain that you are bound to invent such stories as will encourage\nand not depress your credulous friends. You have no right to attempt\nto rob them of their most precious possession in times like these,\nnamely, the power of steadfast resistance of the spirit to trouble and\nanxiety, by inventing further causes of depression. The law forbids\nyou to take away a man's forks and spoons; it ought also to forbid the\ndissemination of such false news as will deprive him of his appetite\nfor his mutton chop.\n\nIndeed, I fancy that by the law of England as laid down in the\nstatute-book it is treasonable in times of national crisis to\ndiscourage the subjects of the King, and I wonder whether it would not\nbe possible, as there has been so little grouse-shooting this year, to\nhave a grouser-shoot instead. A quantity of old birds want clearing\noff. Guns might be placed, let us say, in butts erected along the south\nside of Piccadilly, and the grousers would be driven from the moors\nof Mayfair by a line of beaters starting from Oxford Street. The game\nwould break cover, so I suppose, from Dover Street, Berkeley Street,\nHalf Moon Street, and so on, and to prevent their escaping into Regent\nStreet on the one side and Park Lane on the other, stops would be\nplaced at the entrance of streets debouching here in the shape of huge\nposters announcing victories by land and sea for the Allied forces.\nThese the grousers would naturally be unable to pass, and thus they\nwould be driven out into Piccadilly and shot. This would take the\nmorning, and after a good lunch at the Ritz Hotel the shooters would\nproceed to the covers of Kensington. Other days would, of course, be\narranged....\n\nBut all this month the devastating tide swept on through Serbia.\nOccasionally there were checks, as, for a moment, it dashed against\nsome little reef before submerging it; but soon wave succeeding wave\noverleaped such barriers, and now Serbia lies under the waters of the\ninundation. And in these shortening days of autumn the sky grows red in\nthe East with the dawning of new fires of battle, and to the watchers\nthere it goes down red in the West, where from Switzerland to the sea,\nbehind the trenches, the graveyards stretch themselves out over the\nunsown fields of France.\n\n\n\n\nNOVEMBER, 1916\n\n\nFrancis arrived on the last day of October, with a week's leave before\nhis regiment embarked for the Dardanelles. For a few hours he was a\nmere mass of physical needs; until these were satisfied he announced\nhimself as incapable of thinking or speaking of anything but the\ncarnalities.\n\n\"Tea at once,\" he said. \"No, I think I won't have tea with you; I\nwant tea sent up to the bath-room. That packet? It's a jar of bath\nsalts--verbena--all of which I am going to use. I saw it in a shop\nwindow, and quite suddenly I knew I wanted it. Nothing else seemed\nto matter. I want a dressing-gown, too. Will you lend me one? And\nslippers. For a few hours I propose to wallow in a sensual sty. I've\nplanned it all, and for the last week I have thought of nothing else.\"\n\nHe sketched the sty. There was to be tea in the bath-room and a muffin\nfor tea. This he would eat as he lay in a hot bath full of verbena\nsalts. He would then put on his dressing-gown and lie in bed for half\nan hour, reading a shilling shocker and smoking cigarettes. (End of\nPart I.) Still in his dressing-gown he would come downstairs, and smoke\nmore cigarettes before my fire, till it was time to have a cocktail.\nWe would dine at home (he left the question of dinner to me, provided\nonly that there should be a pineapple), after which we should go to\nthe movies. We were then to drive rapidly home in a taxi, and, over\nsandwiches and whisky and soda, he felt that he would return to a\nnormal level again. But the idea of being completely comfortable and\nclean and gorged and amused for a few hours had taken such hold of him,\nthat he could not \"reach his mind\" until the howling beast of his body\nhad been satisfied. That, at least, was the plan.\n\nAccordingly, proclamation having come from upstairs that all was ready,\nFrancis departed to his sty, and I, as commanded, waited till such time\nas he should reappear in my dressing-gown and slippers. But long before\nhis programme (Part I.) could have been carried out he re-entered.\n\n\"It didn't seem worth while to get into bed,\" he said, \"so I left that\nout. I loved the bath-salts, and the tea was excellent. But how soon\nanything that can be satisfied is satisfied. It's only----\"\n\nHe leaned forward and poked the fire, stretching his legs out towards\nthe blaze.\n\n\"I've travelled a long way since we met,\" he said, \"and the further one\ngoes the simpler the way becomes. The mystics are perfectly right. You\ncan only get what you want, what your soul wants, by chucking away all\nthat you have. The only way to find yourself is to lose yourself. I've\nbeen losing myself all these months, and I began to recover little bits\nof me that I didn't want over the muffin and the verbena. I was afraid\nI should find more if I tucked up in bed. That's why I didn't. I used\nto want such lots of things; now there is growing a pile of things I\ndon't want.\"\n\nI put the cigarette-box near him.\n\n\"There are the smokes,\" I said, \"and let me know when you want a\ncocktail. We'll have dinner when you like. Now I have heard nothing\nfrom you for the last three months; let's have a budget.\"\n\n\"Right. Well, the material side of the affair is soon done with. I'm\nQuartermaster-Sergeant, with stripes and a crown on my arm, as you have\nnoticed, and I live immersed in accounts and stores and supplies. I\nhave to see that the men have enough and are comfortable, and I have to\nbe as economical as I can. That's my life, and it's being my salvation.\"\n\nHe lay back in his chair, the picture of complete indolence, with eyes\nhalf closed. But I knew that to be a sign of intense internal activity.\nMost people, I am aware, when they are aflame with some mental or\nspiritual topic, walk up and down with bright eyes and gesticulating\nhands. But it is Francis's great conjuring trick to disconnect his\nphysical self, so to speak, and let it lie indolent; his theory is that\nthus your vitality is concentrated on thought. There seems something to\nbe said for it, when once you have learned how to do it.\n\n\"Of course, in order to get anywhere,\" he said, \"you must go through\ncontemplative periods and stages, and towards the end of the journey,\nI fancy that you enter into an existence where only that is possible.\nBut before that comes, you have to know the sacredness of common\nthings. It's like this. The first stage is to know that the only thing\nworth our consideration is the reality that lies behind common things:\nit is then that you think them worthless and disregard them. But\nfurther on you find out that they aren't common, because the reality\nbehind permeates them, and makes them sacred. Later, if you ever get\nthere, you find, I believe, that in your union with the reality behind,\nthey cease to exist again for you. But, good heavens, what miles apart,\nare the first and third stages! And the danger of the first stage is\nthat, if you are not careful, you imagine it to be the same as the\nthird.\n\n\"I was in danger of getting like that, living in perfect comfort and\npeace on that adorable island. Do you know how a jelly looks the day\nafter a dinner-party, how it is fatigued, and lies down and gets\nshapeless and soft? I might have stayed in that stage, if the war\nhadn't summoned me. I did not consciously want material things: I was\nnot greedy or lustful, and I had a perfectly conscious knowledge that\nGod existed in everything. But I didn't reverence things for that\nreason, nor did I mix myself up in them. I held aloof, and was content\nto think. Then came the war, and now for nearly fifteen months I have\nbeen learning to get close to common things, to see, as I said, that\nthe sacredness of their origin pervades them. It doesn't lie in them,\ntucked away in some secret drawer, which you have to open by touching\na spring. The spring you have to touch is in yourself, you have\nto open your own perception of what is always before your eyes. It\ndoesn't require any wit or poetic sense to perceive it: it is there, a\nplain simple phenomenon. But in it is the answer to the whole cosmic\nconundrum, for there lies the Love that 'moves the sun and the other\nstars!' Theoretically I knew that, but not practically.\n\n\"Now, after a good deal of what you might call spade-work, I'm\nbeginning to feel that, first-hand. For months I hated the drill, and\nthe sordidness (so I said) and the life in which you are so seldom\nalone. I hated the rough clothes, and the heavy boots and the food.\nBut I never hated the other fellows: I've always liked people. Then\nwhen I got on I hated the accounts I had to do, and the supplies I\nhad to weigh, but in one thing I never faltered, and that was in the\ndesire to get at what lay behind it all. There was something more in\nit than the fact that the work had to be done because England was at\nwar with Germany, and because I wanted to help. That was sufficient to\nbring me out of Alatri, and it would have been sufficient to carry me\nalong, even if there had been nothing else behind it. But always I had\nthe knowledge of there being something else behind. And clearly the\nlife I was leading gave me admirable conditions for finding that out.\nEverything was very simple: I had no independence; I had to do what I\nwas told. You may bet that obedience is the key to freedom.\n\n\"There were days of storm and days of peace, of course. There were\ndarknesses in which one was tempted to say that there wasn't anything\nto be perceived. Some persistent devil inside me kept suggesting that\nan account-book was just an account-book, and a rifle nothing more than\na rifle. But I still clung to that which had grown, in all those years\nat Alatri, to be a matter of knowledge. I knew there was something\nbehind, and I knew what it was, though the mists obscured it, just as\nwhen the sea-fog comes down in the winter over the island, and you\ncannot see the mainland for days together. But you don't seriously\nquestion whether the mainland is there because you don't see it. A\nchild might: if you told a child that the mainland had been taken\naway, he would probably accept what you said.... There were days when\nI doubted everything, not only the reality at the back of it all, but\neven the immediate cause for my work, namely, that the regiment was\npart of the army that was fighting the Germans, and that so it was my\njob to help.\n\n\"And then, one day when I was least expecting it or consciously\nthinking of it, the knowledge came with that sense of realization that\nmakes all the difference between theoretical and practical knowledge. I\nwas among the stores, rather busy, and suddenly the tins of petroleum\nshone with God. Just that.\"\n\nHe turned his handsome, merry face to me: there was no solemnity in it,\nit was as if he had told me some cheerful piece of ordinary news.\n\n\"Now will you understand me when I say that that moment was in no\nsense overwhelming, nor did it interfere in the slightest degree with\neither the common work of the day, drill and accounts and what not,\nor with the common diversions of the day? It did not even give them\na new meaning, for I had known for years that the meaning was there;\nonly, it had not been to me a matter of practical knowledge. It was\nlike--well, you know how slow I am at learning anything on the piano,\nbut with sufficient industry I can get a thing by heart at last. It\nwas like that: it was like the first occasion on which one plays it\nby heart. It did not yet, nor does it now get between me and all the\nthings that fill the day. It is not a veil drawn between me and them,\nso that drudgery and little menial offices are no longer worth while:\nit is just the opposite: it is as if a veil were drawn away, and I can\nsee them and handle them more clearly and efficiently, and enjoy them\ninfinitely more. This warm fire feels more delightfully comfortable\nthan ever a fire did. I take more pleasure in seeing you sitting there\nnear me than ever before. There was never such a good muffin as the one\nyou sent up to the bath-room. That's only natural, if you come to think\nof it. It would be a very odd sort of illumination, if it served only\nto make what we have got to do obscure or tiresome or trivial. Instead,\nit redeems the common things from triviality. It takes weariness out of\nthe world.\"\n\n\"You said the petroleum-tins shone with God,\" I said. \"Can you tell me\nabout that? Was it a visible light?\"\n\n\"I wondered if you would ask that,\" he said, \"and I wish I could\nexplain it better. There was no visible light, nothing like physical\nillumination round them. But my eyes told that faculty within me which\ntruly perceives, that they shone. What does St. Paul call it? 'The\nlight invisible,' isn't it? That is exactly descriptive. 'The light\ninvisible, the uncreated light.' I can't tell you more than that, and\nI expect that it is only to be understood by those who have seen it. I\nam quite conscious that my description of it must mean nothing. I have\nlong known it was there, and so have you, but till I perceived it I had\nno idea what it was like.\"\n\n\"There's another thing,\" said I, \"you are going out next week to the\nDardanelles. What does the business of killing look like in the light\nof the light invisible?\"\n\nHe laughed again.\n\n\"It hasn't turned me into a conscientious objector, if you mean that,\"\nhe said. \"I hate the notion of shooting jolly funny rabbits, or merry\npartridges, though I'm quite inconsistent enough to eat them when they\nare shot--at least, not rabbits: I would as soon eat rats. But I shall\ndo my best to kill as many Turks as I possibly can. I _know_ it's right\nthat we should win this war. I was never more certain about anything.\nThe Prussian standpoint is the devil's standpoint, and since it's our\nbusiness to fight the devil, we've got to fight the Prussians and all\nwho are allied with them. It seems a miserable way of fighting the\ndevil, to go potting Turks. If I could only get to know the fellows I\nhope I am going to kill, I would bet that I should find them awfully\ndecent chaps. I shouldn't be surprised if they would shine, too, like\nthe petroleum-tins. But there's no other alternative. No doubt if our\ndiplomatists hadn't been such apes, we should be friends with the\nTurks, instead of being their enemies, but, as it is, there's no help\nfor it. I've no patience with pacificists; we've got to fight, unless\nwe choose to renounce God. As for the man who has a conscientious\nobjection to killing anybody, I think you will find very often that\nhe has a conscientious objection to being killed. I haven't any\nconscientious objection to either. I shall be delighted to kill Turks,\nand I'm sure I don't grudge them the pleasure of killing me.\"\n\n\"But you think they're fighting on the devil's side,\" I objected. \"You\ndon't want to be downed by the devil?\"\n\n\"Oh, they don't down me by shooting me,\" he said. \"Also, they don't\nthink they are in league with the devil; at least, we must give them\nthe credit of not thinking so, and they've got every bit as good a\nright to their view as I have. Lord! I am glad, if I may say it without\nprofanity, that I'm not God. Fancy having millions and millions of\nprayers, good sincere honest prayers, addressed to you every day from\nopposite sides, entreating you to grant supplications for victory!\nAwfully puzzling, for Him! You'd know what excellent fellows a lot of\nour enemies are.\"\n\nThe clock on the mantelpiece chimed at this moment, and Francis jumped\nup with a squeal.\n\n\"Eight o'clock already!\" he said. \"What an idiot you are for letting me\njaw along like this! I'm not dressed yet, nor are you.\"\n\n\"You may dine in a dressing-gown if you like,\" I said.\n\n\"Thanks, but I don't want to in the least. I want to put on the fine\nnew dress-clothes which I left here a year ago. Do dress too; let's\nput on white ties and white waistcoats, and be smart, and pompous. I\nlove the feeling of being dressed up. Perhaps we won't go to the movies\nafterwards; what do you think? We can't enjoy ourselves more than\nsitting in this jolly room and talking. At least, I can't; I don't know\nabout you. Oh, and another thing. You have a day off to-morrow, haven't\nyou, it being Saturday? Let's go and stay in the country till Monday.\nI've been in a town for so many months. Let's go to an inn somewhere\nwhere there are downs and trees, and nobody to bother. If we stayed\nwith people, we should have to be polite and punctual. I don't want to\nbe either. I don't want to hold forth about being a Tommy, except to\nyou. Most people think there's something heroic and marvellous about\nit, and they make me feel self-conscious. It's no more heroic than\neating when you're hungry. You want to: you've got to: your inside\ncries out for food, it scolds you till you give it some.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe put Francis's plan into execution next morning, and at an early\nhour left town for a certain inn, of which I had pleasant memories,\non the shore of the great open sea of Ashdown Forest, to spend three\ndays there, for I got rid of my work on Monday. St. Martin came with\nus and gave us warm windless days of sun, and nights with a scrap of\nfrost tingling from the stars, so that in the morning the white rime\nturned the blades of grass into spears of jewellery, and the adorable\nsharp scent of autumn mornings pricked the nostrils. The great joyful\nforest was ablaze with the red-gold livery of beech trees, and the pale\ngold of birches, and holly trees wore clusters of scarlet berries among\ntheir stiff varnished foliage. Elsewhere battalions of pines with tawny\nstems defied the spirit of the falling leaf, and clad the hill-sides\nwith tufts of green serge, in which there sounded the murmur of distant\nseas. Here the foot slid over floors of fallen needles, and in the\nvaulted darkness, where scarce a ray of sun filtered down, there seemed\nto beat the very heart of the forest, and we went softly, not knowing\nbut that presently some sharp-eared faun might peep round a tree-trunk,\nor a flying drapery betray a dryad of the woods.\n\nDeeper and deeper we went into the primeval aisles, among the Druid\ntrees that stood, finger on lip, for perhaps even Pan himself had\nlately passed that way, and they, initiate, had looked on the\nincarnate spirit of Nature. Then, distantly, the gleam of sunshine\nbetween the trunks would show the gates of this temple of forest, and\nwe passed out again into broad open spaces, covered with the russet of\nbracken, and stiff with ling, on which the spikes of minute blossom\nwere still pink. Here we tramped till the frosted dews had melted and\ndried, and sat in mossy hollows, where gorse was still a-flower, and\nsmelled of cocoa-nut biscuits. Across the weald the long line of South\nDowns, made millions of years ago by uncounted myriads of live things,\nwas thrust up like some heaving shoulder of a marine monster above the\nwaves. It seemed necessary to walk along that heavenly ridge, and next\nday, we drove to Lewes, and with pockets bulging with lunch, climbed on\nto that fair and empty place. There, with all Sussex lying below us,\nand the sea stretched like a brass wire along the edge of the land to\nthe south, we made a _cache,_ containing the record of the expedition,\nand buried it in a tin-box below a certain gnarled stump that stood on\nthe edge of the steep descent on to the plain. Francis insisted also\non leaving our empty wine bottle there, with a wisp of paper inside\nit, on which he wrote: \"We are now utterly without food, and have\nalready eaten the third mate. Tough, but otherwise excellent. Latitude\nunknown: longitude unknown: God help us!\" And he signed it with the\nnames of Queen Adelaide and Marcus Aurelius. Neither he nor I could\nthink of anything sillier than this, and since, when you are being\nsilly, you have to get sillier and sillier, or else you are involved in\nanticlimaxes, he rolled over on to his face and became serious again.\n\n\"Lord, Lord, how I love life!\" he said, \"in whatever form it manifests\nitself. I love these great open and empty places, and the smile of the\nindolent earth. Great kind Mother, she is getting sleepy, and will\nsoon withdraw all her thoughts back into herself and doze and dream\ntill spring awakens her again. She will make no more birds and beasts\nand flowers yet awhile, for those are the thoughts she puts out, but\ncollect herself into herself, hibernating in the infinite cave of the\nheavens. All the spring and the summer she has been so busy, thinking,\nthinking, and putting forth her thoughts. In the autumn she lies down\nand just looks at what she has made, and in the winter she sleeps.\nI love that life of the earth, which is so curiously independent of\nours, pagan in its essence, you would think, and taking very little\nheed of the children of men and the sons of God. How odd she must think\nour businesses and ambitions, she who only makes, and feeds. What a\nspendthrift, too, how lavish of life, how indifferent to pain, and\ndeath, and all the ills that her nurselings make for themselves. She\ndoesn't care, bless you.\"\n\n\"You called her kind just now,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Yes, she is kind to joy, because joy is productive. She loves health\nand vitality and love, but she has no use for anything else. It is only\none aspect of her, however, the pagan side, which sets Pan a-fluting\nin the thickets. But what she makes is always greater than she who made\nit. She gives us and maintains for us till death our physical nature,\nand yet the moment she has given it us, even before perhaps, it has\npassed out of her hands, being transfused with God. Then, when she has\ndone with us, she lets death overtake us, and has no more use for us,\nexcept in so far that our bodies can enrich her soil. She does not\nknow, the pagan earth, that death is only an incident in our lives.\nThe death of our body, as St. Francis says, is only our sister, for\nwhom we should praise God just as much as for our life, or the sun and\nmoon. Really, I don't know what I should do, how I should behave, if\nI thought it ever so faintly possible that death was the end of us.\nShould I take immense care of myself, so as to put off that end as long\nas possible, and in the interval grab at every pleasure and delight I\ncould find? I don't think so. If I thought that death was the end, I\nthink I should kill myself instantly, out of sheer boredom. All the\nbubble would have gone out of the champagne. I love all the pleasures\nand interests of life just because they are part of an infinitely\nbigger affair. If there wasn't that within them, I don't think I should\ncare about them.\"\n\n\"But if they are only part of the bigger thing,\" said I, \"why don't we\nkill ourselves at once, in order to get to the bigger thing?\"\n\n\"Surely for a very good reason, namely, that whatever life lies\nbeyond, it cannot be this life again. And this life is such awful fun:\nI want lots of it. But it doesn't rank in the same class with the\nother. I mean that no sensible fellow will want to prolong this at\nthe expense of what comes after. Much as we like it, we are perfectly\nwilling to throw it away if we are shown a sufficiently good cause to\nthrow it away for. It's like a tooth: have it out if it aches. And life\nwould ache abominably if we clung to it unworthily.\"\n\nSuddenly I felt horribly depressed.\n\n\"Oh, Francis, don't die at the Dardanelles,\" I said.\n\n\"I haven't the slightest intention of doing so. I sincerely hope I\nshall do nothing of the sort. But if I do, mind you remember that I\nknow it is only an incident in life. As we sit here, secure in the sun\nand the safety, it is easy enough to realize that. But it is harder\nto realize it when it happens to someone you like, and people are apt\nto talk rot about the cruel cutting-short of a bright young life. My\nbright middle-aged life mustn't rouse these silly reflections, please,\nif it's cut off. They are unreal: there is a touch of cant about them.\nSo promise!\"\n\n\"If you'll promise not to die, I'll promise not to be vexed at your\ndeath. Besides, you aren't middle-aged; you're about fourteen.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope I'm younger now at thirty-five than I was when I was\nfourteen. I used to be terribly serious at fourteen, and think about my\nsoul in a way that was positively sickening. I wonder my bright young\nlife wasn't cut short by a spasm of self-edification. I was a prig, and\nprigs are the oldest people in the world. They are older than the rocks\nthey sit among, as Mr. Pater said, and have been dead many times. You\ndidn't know me then, thank God.\"\n\n\"Were you very beastly?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite horrible, and so old. Easily old enough to be my own father\nnow, if that's what Wordsworth means when he says the child is father\nto the man. I thought a lot about my soul, and took great care of it,\nand wrapped it up. In fact, I set about everything entirely the wrong\nway. What does Thomas \u00c3\u00a0 Kempis say, do you remember? That a man must\nforsake himself, and go wholly from himself, and retain nothing out of\nself-love. He must give up his soul too, for it is only by giving it up\nthat he avoids losing it....\"\n\nHe turned over again on his face, sniffing a sprig of thyme that still\nlingered into November.\n\n\"And yet, oh, how I love all the jolly things in the world!\" he\nsaid; \"but I don't want them to be mine, and I don't think that I am\nentangled in them. Surely it is right to love them if you don't cling\nto them. I love the smile of the earth when she wakes in spring, and\nputs forth her thoughts again. When she thinks about hawthorn, she\nthinks in little squibs of green leaf, when she thinks about birds she\nthinks in terms of nightingale-song, or when she thinks about crocuses\nshe sees her thoughts expressed in yellow chalices, with pollen-coated\ntongues. She thinks she has had enough of the grey winter-withered\ngrass, and, lo, the phalanxes of minute green spears charge and rout\nit. She thinks in the scent of wall-flowers, and the swift running of\nlizards on the stone-walls, and pinks of peach-blossom, and foam of\norchid-flower. My goodness, what a poet she is!\"\n\n\"And you aren't attached to all that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course I like it tremendously, but it doesn't entangle me any\nmore. But I took years to disentangle myself, all those years when you\nthought I was being so lazy and ineffective in Alatri. Ineffective I\nwas, no one ever made less of a splash than I have done; but lazy I\nwasn't. I thought, and I thought, and unconsciously to myself, while I\nwas sunk, as I imagined, in a stupor of purring content with the world,\nthis war woke me up, and, as you know, I found I wasn't entangled. But\nI have learned such a lot this year. I always liked people: I liked\ntheir funny ridiculous ways, their queernesses and their attractions.\nBut I never got into them before. People are like oranges: the rind\nsmells delicious, you like them first for the rind. Then just inside\nthe rind you find that fluffy white stuff, but inside of all is the\nsubstance of them, in which lies their unity with God. There is this,\ntoo: when you get down to the fruit, you find that it has the same\nsavour as the rind. I take it that the attraction of people, the thing\nyou love them for, is the first thing you perceive about them, the\naromatic rind. It's a hint of what is within, if you get through\ntheir fluffy part. You find first of all the emanation of their real\nselves, next their funny odd ways, and finally themselves. Deep in the\nheart of everyone you find what seemed at first their most superficial\nqualities. That's an excursus by the way; think it out for yourself.\"\n\nThe sun was already wheeling westwards, and presently after, as we had\nhalf a dozen miles of this high down-land to traverse, we got up and\nwent on our way. Here and there a copse of flaming beech climbed like\nstealthy fire up from the weald on to this roof of South England, on\nthe ridge of which we walked; but the prevalent wind from the sea had\nso continuously blown their branches in one direction that now they\ngrew there, brushed back in permanence, as Francis suggested, like\nthe hair of a Knut. Northwards and far below the weald stretched into\nmisty distances, laid out like a map, with here and there a pond, here\na group of clustered houses, while a moving plume of steam marked the\npassage of a train. Mile after mile of springy turf we traversed,\nempty and yellowing and uniform, save where a patch of brambles lay\ndark, like the shadow from a cloud. Once or twice we passed a dew-pond\ndug in the chalk, but otherwise in all those miles we found no sign\nup here on the heights of the fretful ways and works of man. All was\nuntouched and antique: a thousand years had wrought no more change\nhere than on the liquid plain of the sea. A steady westerly breeze met\nus all the way, warmed with the leagues of autumn sunshine through\nwhich it had travelled all day, and it streamed past us like some quiet\nflowing river out of the eternal reservoir of the sky. And never, even\nin children, round whom there still trail the clouds of glory, have I\nseen such ecstatic and natural enjoyment as was Francis's. Around them,\nperhaps, linger the lights that play outside the prison-house, but to\nhim, it seemed that into the prison-house itself there streamed in such\na jubilation of sunshine that every vestige of shade was banished.\nLike the petroleum-tins, when first illumination had come to him, the\nwhole world shone with God, and that in no vague and mystical manner,\nbut with a defined and comprehended brightness. Here was no dream-like\nmysticism, no indifferent contemplation like that of the Quietists,\nbut an active and ecstatic enjoyment, eager and alert, and altogether\nhuman. He moved in a fairyland, the magic of which was not imaginary\nand fabulous; the spell lay in the very fact that it was real. He was\nconvinced by the conviction that comes from personal experience: the\nglory that enveloped the world was as certain as the streaming wind and\nthe pervasion of the autumn sun.\n\nIt was no haphazard intoxication of animal spirits that possessed him,\nno wild primal delight in health and physical vigour, it was a joy that\nhad had its birth in thought and contemplation, and had passed through\ndark places and deserts. But, even as the sunlight of ages past sleeps\nin seams of coal, ready to burst into blaze, so through darknesses and\ndoubts had passed the potential sunlight of his soul, black, you would\nsay, and dormant, but alive and pregnant with flame, when the finger of\nGod touched it into illumination. For him no longer in gloomy recesses\nsat Pan, the incarnate aspect of the cruelty and the lust of Nature,\nthe sight of whom meant death to the seer, but over all the world shone\nthe face of Christ, Who, by the one oblation of Himself, had transfused\nHis divine nature into all that lived and moved. This was no fact just\naccepted, and taken for granted: it was the light from which sprang all\nhis joy of life, the one central and experienced truth which made all\ncommon things sacred, and opened for him, as for all mystics who have\nattained the first illumination, the gates of pearl within which shines\nthe Heavenly Kingdom. This was no visionary place: it stood solid about\nhim, an Earthly Paradise no less than a heavenly, and men and women\nwere its citizens, the hills and valleys, the birds and beasts of this\nactual world were of it, the blaze of the westering sun lit it, and\nthis wind from the West streamed over it. And yet it was the actual\nkingdom of heaven.\n\nFrancis told me that day how he had attained to where he stood. It was\nby no vague inactive passivity, but by stern and unremitting training\nof the mind and spirit. He had learned by hard work, first of all, to\nconcentrate his mind on some given concrete object, to the exclusion of\nall other objects, forcing himself, as he put it, \"to flow into this\none thing.\" By slow degrees he had so cultivated this power that he\nwas able at last to be conscious of nothing else than that on which he\nfixed his attention, making all his faculties of perception concentrate\nupon it. One of the objects of his meditation had often been the\nstone-pine in our garden at Alatri, and \"opening himself to it,\" as\nhe said, he saw it not only as it was in shape and form, but into his\nmind were conveyed its whole nature and formation; not by imagining\nthem, so it seemed to him, for himself, but by receiving suggestions\nfrom outside. He felt it growing from the pine-seed of a cone that had\ndropped there; he felt it as a sapling, and knew how its roots were\ngroping their ways underground, one to the north, another to the south,\nto anchor it from the stress of winds. He felt the word go forth among\nthe spiders and creeping things that here was a new city a-building for\ntheir habitations. Out of the sapling stage it passed into mature life,\nand stripped itself of its lower branches, concentrating its energy on\nits crown of foliage. The soft sappy bark hardened itself to resist\nthe rains, the roots spread further and further, and burrowed more\ndeeply: the murmur of sea began to nest in its branches, and its shadow\nspread like a pool around it. It grew fruitful with cones that opened\nthemselves so that its seed might ripen; it became a town of fertility.\nAll this came, not student-wise, but from eager meditation, a vision\nevoked not from within, but seen through the open windows of his mind.\nA new mode of sight dawned on him.\n\nFrom meditation on concrete and visible things he passed to meditation\non abstract qualities, which clothed themselves in images. He saw\nMercy, a woman with hands of compassion, touching and remitting the\ndebts of the crowd that brought the penalties they had incurred: he saw\nTruth, nude and splendid, standing on the beach, fresh from the sea,\nwith a smile for those who ignorantly feared him, and anger blazing\nfrom his eyes for those who tried to hide from him, and hands of love\nfor those who came to him. But such visions never came to the scope of\nhis physical sight, only by interior vision did he see Mercy bending to\nhim, and Truth holding out a strong and tender hand. Their presences\nlived with him, and the gradual realization of them caused a shining\ncompany to stand round him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut they were not what he sought: he sought that which lay behind them,\nthat of which, for all their splendour, they were but the pale symbols\nand imperfect expressions. They were the heralds of the King, who\nattended in his presence-chamber, and came forth into the world radiant\nwith his tokens. There were strange presences among them: there came\nSorrow with bowed head, and Pain with pierced hands, and that darkness\nof the soul which still refuses to disbelieve in light. Often he turned\nhis face from these storm-vexed visitants, crying out that they were\nbut phantoms of the pit, and yet not quite endorsing his rejection of\nthem, for their wounded hands shone, and there lurked a secret behind\nthe tragedy of their faces....\n\nWe had come to the end of the ridge, and must descend into the plain\nbelow us. The sun had just set, and the wind that still blew steadily\nfrom the West held its breath for a moment.\n\n\"They took their places there,\" said Francis, \"until they became\nfriendly and glorious, and I did not fear them any longer. I knew\nwhat they represented, of what they were the symbols. Just as I had\ncontemplated the stone-pine till I saw what was the nature from which\nit sprang, so I contemplated Sorrow and Doubt, till I saw that they had\ncome from the Garden of Gethsemane. They are as holy as Mercy or Truth,\nand their touch sanctifies all the pain and sorrow that you and I and\nthe whole world can ever feel. I dwelt within them. I learned to love\nthem. I learned also to do the daily tasks that were mine, no longer\nwith any sense of the triviality of them or with the notion that I\nmight have been better employed on larger things. But for a long time,\nemployed on this common round, nothing more happened: I just went on\ndoing them, believing that they were part of a great whole, but not, I\nmay say, energetically conscious of it. Then one day, as I told you, I\nsaw God shining from the petroleum-tins and the shelves of the store.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere are certain moments in one's life that are imperishably\nphotographed on the mind, and will live there unblurred and unfaded\ntill the end. I think the reason for this (when so much that seemed\nimportant at the time, constantly fades from one's memory) is that in\nsome way, great or small, they mark the advent of a new perception,\nand this sense of enlightenment gives them their everlasting quality.\nThey are thus more commonly associated with childish days, when\ndiscoveries are of more frequent occurrence than is the case in later\nyears. Certainly now the smell of lilac is hugely significant to me\nbecause of that one moment when, at the exploring age of five, I was\nfirst consciously aware of it. It was time to go to bed, though the\nsunlight still lay level across the garden where we children played,\nand the nurse who had come to fetch us in, relented, and gave us five\nminutes' grace, the granting of which at that moment seemed to endow\none with all that was really desirable in life. Simultaneously the\nevening breeze disentangled the web of fragrance from the lilac bush\nnear which I stood, and cast it over me, so that, imperishable to this\nday, the scent of it is mixed up in my mind with a mood of ecstatic\nhappiness. What went before that, what had been the history of the\nafternoon, or what was the history of the days that followed, has quite\ngone, but vignetted for ever for me is the smell of the lilac bush and\nthe rapture of five minutes more play. The first conscious sight of the\nsea, lying grey and quiet beneath a low sky, is another such picture,\nand another such, I am sure, will be the sight of Francis's face as he\nstood there facing westwards, with the glow of molten clouds on it,\nand with the wind just stirring his hair, as he stood bare-headed, and\nspoke those last words. The memory of our walk that day may grow dim,\nmuch may get blurred and indistinct in my mind, but his face then,\nalight with joy, not solemn joy at all, but sheer human happiness, will\nlive to me in the manner of the lilac-scent, and the first sight of the\nsea. It was new; never before had I seen so complete an exuberance, so\nunshadowed a bliss.\n\nWe returned to town next morning. Two days later he rejoined his\nregiment.\n\n\n\n\nDECEMBER, 1915\n\n\nDuty under a somewhat threadbare disguise of pleasure has the upper\nhand just now, in this energetic city, and we spend a large number of\nour afternoons each week seated in half-guinea and guinea stalls, and\nwatch delightful entertainments at theatres or listen to concerts at\nprivate houses, got up for the benefit of some most deserving charity,\nand for the really opulent there are seats at three or five guineas.\nThese entertainments are as delightful as they are long, and we have\nan opportunity two or three times a week of seeing the greater part of\nour prominent actors and actresses, and hearing the most accomplished\nsingers and players on all or more than all of the musical instruments\nknown to Nebuchadnezzar pour forth a practically endless stream of\nmelody. Certainly it is a great pleasure to hear these delightful\nthings, but, as I have said, it is really duty that prompts us to live\nfor pleasure, for the pleasure, by incessant wear, is getting a little\nthin. We should not dream of spending so much on seats in theatres if\nwe were not contributing to a cause. Often tea of the most elaborate\nand substantial style is thrown in, and thus our bodies as well as our\nminds are sumptuously catered for. Soon, I suppose, when we have once\nfreed our minds from the nightmare of Zeppelins, we shall have these\nentertainments in the evening with dinner thrown in. The only little\ndrawback connected with them is concerned with the matter of tickets.\nNaturally you do not want to go alone, and in consequence, when you are\nasked to take tickets you take two guinea ones if you are rich, and if\nnot two half-guinea ones. There is no question of refusing. You have\ngot to. But it is not so easy as you would imagine to get somebody to\ngo with you to these perpetual feasts of histrionic and vocal talent,\nfor everyone else has already taken two tickets, and is eagerly\nhunting for a companion at these entertainments on behalf of funds for\nSerbians, Russians, French, Italians, Red Cross, eggs for hospitals,\nsmokes for sailors, soup kitchens, disabled horses, bandages, kit-bags,\nmine-sweepers, cough lozenges, for aeroplanists, woollen mufflers, and\nall the multifarious needs of those who are or have been taking a hand\nin the fight. Indeed, sometimes I think those entertainments are a\nlittle overdone, for a responsible admiral told me the other day that\nif any more woollen mufflers were sent to the fleet it would assuredly\nsink, which would be a very disastrous consequence of too ardent a\nspirit of charity. But till the fleet sinks under the woollies that\nare poured into it, and the kitchens are so flooded with soup as to be\nuntenable, I suppose we shall continue to take two stalls and wildly\nhunt about for someone to occupy the second, between the hours of two\nand seven-thirty. But whether there is a theatrical entertainment or\nnot on any particular day, it is sure to be a flag day. You need not\nbuy two flags, though you have been obliged to take two stalls--until\nyou have lost the first one. But it is as essential as breathing to buy\none flag, if you propose to go out of doors at all, and on the whole\nit is wiser to buy your decoration from the first seller that you see.\nIt is your ransom; the payment of this amiable blackmail ensures your\nunmolested passage through the streets. True, for a time, you can play\na very pretty game which consists in crossing the street when you see\na flag-seller imminent, and proceeding along the opposite pavement.\nSoon another flag-seller will be imminent there also, upon the approach\nof whom you cross back again to your original pavement. But sooner or\nlater you are bound to be caught: a van or an omnibus obstructs the\nclear view of the other side of the street, and after being heavily\nsplashed with mud from the roadway, you regain the pavement only to\nfind there is another flag-seller who has been in ambush behind the\n'bus that has splashed you. If you are urgently in need of exercise\nyou can step back again before encountering the privateer, but you\nknow that sooner or later you will have to buy a flag, and on the\nwhole it is wiser to buy it at once, and take your exercise with an\nuntroubled mind, and a small garish decoration in your buttonhole. The\nflag-sellers for the most part, are elegant young females, who appear\nto enjoy this unbridled licence to their pillaging propensities, and\nas long as they enjoy it, I suppose flag-days will go on. But it would\nbe simpler and fairer to add a penny to the income-tax, and divide\nit in just proportions between these harpy charities. Or, if that is\ntoo involuntary a method of providing funds for admirable objects, I\nshould suggest that every seller of flags, should, in return for the\nprivilege of helping in such good causes, start her own collection-box\nwith the donation of one sovereign from herself. Then the beleaguered\nfoot-passenger would feel that he was giving to one who had the cause\nfor which she worked really at heart.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust as patriotism has become a feature in the streets, so the same\nmotif has made its appearance in the realms of art, and at these\nentertainments of which I have spoken, there has sprung up a new form\nof dramatic and topical representation. Sometimes it takes the form\nof a skit, and the light side of committees is humorously put before\nus, but more often the author, with a deadlier and more serious aim,\nshows us in symbolical form the Sublimity of Patriotism. Somehow these\nelevating dramas make me blush. I am not ashamed of being patriotic,\nbut I cannot bear to see patriotism set to slow music in front of the\nfootlights, and in the presence of those blue-coated men with crutches\nor arms in slings. The general audience feel it too, and as the curtain\ngoes up for the patriotic sketch, an uncomfortable fidgety silence\ninvariably settles down on the house. The manner of the drama is\nusually somewhat in the following style:\n\nBritannia, in scarlet with a gold crown, is seated in the centre of\nthe stage, and on each side of her is a row of typical female figures,\nwhom she addresses collectively as \"Sisters\" or \"Children.\" In a few\nrhyming lines she gives vent to some noble sentiments about the war,\nand calls on each in turn to express her opinion. As these assembled\nfemales represent Faith, Hope, Belgium, Mother, Wife, Sweetheart,\nSerbia, Child, Justice, Mercy, Russia, Victory and Peace, a very\npleasant variety of sentiments is expressed. Faith brandishes a sword\nwith an ingenious arrangement by which electric lights spring out along\nthe blade, and expresses complete confidence in the righteousness of\nthe cause for which she unsheathed it. Hope looks forward to a bright\ndawn, and fixes her eyes dreamily on the Royal Box. Belgium, giving way\nto very proper emotion when she mentions Namur (rhyming to \"poor\"),\nsinks back on her chair, and Britannia, dismounting from her throne,\nlays a hand on her shoulder and kisses her hair. She then gives Belgium\ninto the care of Faith, and dashing away a tear, resumes her throne,\nand asks Mother what she has to say. Mother and Wife then stand hand\nin hand and assure Britannia that they have sent their son and husband\nto the war because it was their duty to send him and his to go. Mother\nknows the righteousness of the cause. Faith crosses, presses the\nelectric light, and with illuminated sword in hand, kisses Mother.\nMother kisses Faith. Wife knows it too, and looks forward to the\nbright dawn of which Hope has spoken (Hope crosses and embraces Wife:\nmomentary Tableau, accompanied on the orchestra by \"Land of Hope and\nGlory.\" Britannia rises and bows to the audience).\n\nWhen the applause has subsided, they resume, and Britannia calls on\nSweetheart. Sweetheart trips out into the front of the stage, and goes\nthrough a little pantomime alone, but it is at once apparent that\nin her imagination there is a male figure there. There are little\nembracings: she promises the unseen figure not to cry any more, but to\nwrite to him (B.E.F.) every day.\n\nBritannia calls her, \"Brave girl.\"\n\nBritannia (pointing to Child, with a voice already beginning to break\nwith emotion): \"And you, my little one?\"\n\nLong pause.\n\nChild (in a high treble): \"Oh, Mrs. Britannia, do let Daddy come home\nsoon!\" (Pause.) \"Won't he come home soon, Mrs. Britannia?\"\n\nBritannia (choking): \"My little one!\" (Sobs.) \"My little one!\"\n\n(Faith, Hope, Mother, etc., all turn aside and hide their faces, with\nconvulsive movements of their shoulders. Eventually Hope looks firmly\nup at the Royal Box, and a loud click is heard as Faith tries to light\nthe electric sword. As it is out of order, she merely holds it up. This\nis the cue for the play to proceed.)\n\nJustice is rather fierce, and as she speaks about an eye for an eye and\na tooth for a tooth, Britannia rises and with a majestic look sets her\nteeth and flashes her eyes. Mercy intervenes, telling Justice that they\nare sisters, Justice acknowledges the soft impeachment, and hides her\nhead on Mercy's shoulder, who reminds her that the quality of Mercy is\ntwice blest, which is very pleasant for her as she _is_ Mercy.\n\nRolls of drum in the orchestra punctuate what Victory has to say,\nwhich is just as easily described as imagined, but is scarcely worth\ndescription. Then a soft smile irradiates Britannia's face, and she\nsays:\n\n   \"And now that Victory's won I call\n    The fairest sister of you all.\"\n\nOn which Peace advances and crowns Britannia with a green wreath, and a\nsmall stuffed pigeon descends from above Britannia's head and hovers.\nThe curtain descends slowly to long soft chords on the orchestra. The\napplause of relief sounds faintly from various quarters of the house.\nThe curtain instantly ascends again and shows the same picture. It\ngoes up and down five or six times. Then it parts, and Britannia comes\nout and bows to the house. She smiles at someone behind the curtain,\nand extends her hand. A small man in a frock coat and an expression\nof abject misery comes out and clutches it. The audience come to the\nconclusion that he must be the author, and with the amiable idea\nof putting him out of his misery applaud again. On which Britannia\nadvances a little to the left and again beckons behind the curtain.\nOn which Child runs out, and (as previously instructed) after an\nalarmed survey of the house, hides its little face in the ample folds\nof Britannia's gown. Murmurs of sympathy. Britannia (who has a way\nwith her) encourages the infant (who has done this fifty times before,\nand is really as brazen as brass) and points to the Royal Box. Child\ndrops curtsy, amid more applause. Faith, Hope, Mother, Wife, History,\nGeography, Belgium, Peace, Mathematics, Victory, Suicide, Phlebotomy,\nGreen Grocery and any other symbolical figures that there may be, join\nthe group one by one. They all bow, the audience continues applauding:\nFaith (having mastered the unruly mechanism) lights up her sword. Peace\nholds aloft the Dove. Belgium's hair falls down....\n\nThe lights go up in the theatre, and guinea stall turns to guinea stall\nwith a sigh.\n\n\"Oh, George Robey next,\" she says. \"I hope he'll play golf.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow I want to make my position clear. I think it wonderfully kind\nof all these eminent ladies to spend all this time and trouble in\ngiving us this patriotic sketch. I think it wonderfully clever of the\ngentleman who wrote it to have made it all up, and thought of all those\nrhymes. I think every single sentiment expressed in his drama to be\nabsolutely unexceptionable, and, as we hear from the pulpit, \"True in\nthe best sense of the word,\" without even inquiring what that cryptic\nutterance means. But there seems to me to be two weighty objections\nto the whole affair: it is all utterly devoid of the sense of humour\nand of the sense of decency. You may say that when treating of such\ndeeply-felt matters as Faith and Victory and Mother and Child, a sense\nof humour would be out of place. I do not agree: it is the absence of\nthe sense of humour that causes it to be so ridiculous. As for the\npropriety of presenting such things on the stage, I can only say that\nthe Lord Chamberlain ought never to have allowed this and fifty other\nsuch pieces to appear, on grounds of indecent exposure. To present\nunder such ruthless imagery the secret and holiest feelings of the\nheart is much worse than allowing people to appear with no clothes on.\nIt is all true, too: there is its crowning horror. It is just because\nit is so sacredly true that it is totally unfit for public production.\nThere are things you can't even talk about ... and they are just these\nthings that the author of this abomination has put into the mouths of\nthese eminent actresses. And the bowings and the scrapings, and the\nreturn of the actors, all smiles to their friends in the audience....\nOh, swiftly come, George Robey, and let us forget about it!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn this blear-eyed December, which, with its stuffy dark days and\nabsence of sunshine, seems like some drowsy dormouse faintly conscious\nof being awake, and desiring only to be allowed to go to sleep again,\nthere is an immense amount of activity going on. As in those ample\nentertainments for the sake of something, there is exhibited on the\npart of actors, authors and audience an intense desire to be doing\nsomething, so in the general life of the country there is a sense\nof being busy, being strenuous, doing work of some sort in order\nto experience the narcotic influence of occupation. The country is\nunhappy, and since England is a very practical country, it is stifling\nits spiritual unhappiness by being busy. It does things to prevent\nits thinking about things, and though it does very foolish things,\nit shows its common-sense in doing something rather than encourage\nits unhappiness by brooding over it. Herein, it shows its inherent\nvitality: were it less vital it would abandon itself to gloomy\nreflection. But it does not: it is tremendously busy, and so with set\npurpose deprives itself of the tendency to think. That is not very\ndifficult, for, as a nation, we cannot be considered good at thinking.\n\nNow considering that all action of whatever kind is the direct\nresult of thought, it would seem at first sight, when we observe\nthe amazing activities of most people, that these same people must\nthink a great deal. But as a matter of fact, most people, so far from\nthinking a great deal, hardly think at all, and the greater part of\ntheir consistent activity is the result of mere habit. The baby, for\ninstance, who is learning to walk, or the girl who is learning to knit,\nthink immensely and absorbedly about these locomotive and involved\naccomplishments, just because they have not yet formed the habit of\nthem. But a few years later, the baby who has become a man will give\nno thought at all to the act of walking and, indeed, to walk (the feat\nwhich once so engaged his mind), now sets his mind free to think, and\nhe finds that problems which require to be thought out are assisted\nto their solution by the act that once required so much attention:\nsimilarly the grown-up woman often really talks and attends better to\nother things when she is engaged in knitting. The accomplishment has\nsoaked in through the conscious to the sub-conscious self, and demands\nno direction from the practical mind.\n\nIt is on the lines of this analogy that we must explain the fact that\nmany very active people are almost incapable of sustained or coherent\nthought. Many of their activities are matters of habit; they order\ndinner or look at a picture exhibition or argue about the war with no\nmore thought than the man who walks or the woman who knits. They can be\nvoluble about post-impressionism because at one time they acquired the\nhabit of talking about it, and to do so now requires no more exercise\nof the reflective or critical qualities than does the ordering of a\nbeef-steak pudding. Oh, if they argue about the war, most people have\nno original ideas of any kind on the subject: they mix round, as in an\nomelette, certain facts they have seen in the official telegrams, with\ncertain reflections they have read in the leaders of their papers, and\nserve up, hot or cold, as their fancy dictates. But they do not think\nabout it.\n\nThought, in fact, not merely abstract thought, but a far less difficult\nvariety, namely, definite coherent thought about concrete things, is an\nextremely rare accomplishment among grown up people. We are often told\nthat it is infinitely harder to learn anything when we are of mature\nage than when we are young, and this is quite true, the reason for it\nbeing that we now find it more difficult to think since we have so\nlong relied on muddling along under the direction of habit. And even\nthe people who think they think are not in most cases the real owners\nof their thoughts. They borrow their thoughts, as from a circulating\nlibrary, and instead of owning them, return them slightly damaged at\nthe end of a week or two, and borrow some more. They do not think for\nthemselves: they stir about the stale thoughts of others and offer\ntheir insipid porridge as a home-industry.\n\nThis secondhand method of thinking is strangely characteristic of our\nrace, in contradistinction to French and German methods of thought,\nand is admirably illustrated by the anecdote concerning the camel. An\nEnglishman, a Frenchman and a German were bidden to write an essay\non that melancholy beast, deriving their authorities from where they\nchose. The Englishman studied books of natural history at the British\nMuseum, and when he had written an essay founded on them, went and shot\na camel. The Frenchman took his hat and stick and went to the _Jardin\ndes Plantes,_ where he looked at a real camel, and subsequently had a\nride or two on its back. But the German did none of these things: he\nconsulted no authority, he looked at no camel, but shutting himself up\nin his study, he constructed one from his inner consciousness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow whether this offspring of mentality was like a real camel or not,\nhistory does not tell us. Probably it was not, any more than the new\nmap of Europe planned by Prussian militarism will prove like the map\nof Europe as it will appear in the atlases published, let us say, in\n1918. But even if the German camel was totally unrecognizable as such,\nits constructor had shown himself capable of entering on a higher\nplane of thought than is intelligible to the ordinary Englishman. The\nGerman, in fact, as we are beginning to learn, is able to sit down and\nthink, and out of pure thought to build up an image. The English are\nexcellent learners, quick to assimilate and apply what others have\nthought out, the French are vivid and keen observers, but neither have\nthe power of sustained internal thought which characterizes the Teuton,\nwho incidentally is quite the equal of the Englishman at learning and\nof the Frenchman at observation. The German, for instance, thought out\nthe doctrine of submarine warfare, and to our grievous cost applied\nit to our shipping. Similarly they thought out the doctrine of trench\nwarfare, supplemented by gas, then the French, with their marvellously\nquick powers of observation, saw and comprehended and applied. In\nfact, the two great German inventions conceived by them, and originally\nused by them, have been adopted and brought to a higher pitch of\nperfection by their adversaries. But if only any of our allied nations\ncould pick up from them the power of concentrated and imaginative\nthought, for the root of the matter is imagination! We proverbially\nmuddle through, and when occasion arises, by dint of a certain\nstubbornness and admirable stolidity, though pommelled and buffeted,\neventually learn by experience a successful mode of resistance. But\nconstitutionally, we appear incapable of initiating ideas. We cannot\nimagine an occasion, but can only meet the occasion when somebody else\nimagines it.\n\nOf all the disappointments of this year this is the root. We cannot\ninvent: we can only counter. We have not the power of constructive\nimagination, which is the mother and father of original actions. But\nwhen our adversaries indulge in original actions, we can (on occasion)\nthink out an answer to them which is perfectly effective. We can resist\nand we can hit back when we are hit, but at present we have not shown\nthat we are capable of imagining and dealing the first blow. Perhaps\nthis may come, for it goes without saying that we were notoriously\nunready at the beginning of the war, and had our hands full and\noverfull with countering the blows that were rained on us. We were on\nthe defensive and could barely maintain the defence, and could not\npossibly have collected that coiled force which is necessary for any\noffensive movement. But if after sixteen months of war we do not begin\nto show signs of it, it is reasonable to wonder whether the cause of\nthis is not so much that we lack the battering power, but that our\nstatesmen and our generals lack the imagination out of which original\nplans are made. True, there have been two original schemes, namely,\nthat of forcing the Dardanelles and capturing Bagdad, and if these show\nthe quality of our originality, perhaps we are better without it ...\n\nIt is natural that the stress of war should have brought out the\ndeep-rooted, inherent qualities of the nations engaged, and those\nqualities are just those that strike you first in a man of whatever\nnationality. When you know him a little better, you think you detect\nall sorts of other qualities, but when you come really to know\nhim--singly or collectively--he is usually just such as you first\nthought him to be. Indeed, it is as Francis said about the orange: the\nrind has the savour of the fruit within, between the two there is a\nlayer of soft, pulpy stuff. But when you get through that, the man, the\nessential person is like the taste of the rind. This has been immensely\ntrue with regard to the war. On the surface the French strike anyone\nwho comes in contact with them as full of admirable fervour: there is\nthe strong, sharp odour about them, there is a savour that penetrates.\nThen you get to know them just a little better, and you find a woolly\nand casual touch about them, which you, in your ignorance born out\nof a little knowledge, take to be the real spirit of the French. But\nwhen intimate acquaintance, or the stripping of the surface takes\nplace, how you must alter your estimate again, going back to your first\nimpression. You meet the fervour, the strong sharp odour again, and\nit goes into the heart of the nation. The Frenchman is apt on first\nacquaintance to seem too genuine, too patriotically French to be real.\nBut when you get within, when the stress of war has revealed the nation\nand shown the strong beating of its heart, how the fervour and the\nintensity of savour persist! What you thought was superficial you find\nto be the quality that dwells in the innermost. He will easily talk\nabout _La France_ and _La gloire_ when you first get acquainted with\nhim, but when he stands revealed you find that he talks about it easily\nbecause it is the spring and source of his being.\n\nThe same holds with the German. When first you get\nspeaking-acquaintance with a German, you consider him brutal and beery\nand coarse and loud-tongued. You penetrate a little further, and find\nhim watching by the Rhine and musical and philosophical, a peaceful,\naloof dreamer. Such, at any rate, was the experience of Lord Haldane.\nBut when the pulpy, stringy layer is stripped off, when the stress\nof war makes penetration into his real self, you find him again to\nbe as you first thought him, coarse and brutal and clamant, the most\noverweening individual in all creation. Both with the French and the\nGerman you revised your first impressions when you thought you began to\nknow him, only to find when the real man is revealed that he is as you\nfirst thought him. And though it is the hardest thing in the world for\nanyone to form even an approximately true estimate of the race to which\nhe belongs, I think that the same holds of the English. They are at\nheart very much what they appear to be on the surface, blundering but\ntenacious, slow to move, but difficult when once on the move to stop.\nBut really, when I try to think what the English are like, I find I can\nform no conclusion about them, simply because I am of them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have just had a long letter from Francis, a letter radiant with\ninternal happiness. The exterior facts of life cannot much contribute\nto that, for the place where he now is consists, so he tells me,\nentirely of bare hill-side, lined with shallow trenches, bullets and\nswarms of drowsy flies. He hints in a cryptic manner his belief that he\nwill not remain there very long, leaving me to make any conjecture I\nplease. But in the lines and between them I read, as I said, a radiance\nof happiness. He knows, with a strength that throttles all qualms of\nthe flesh, that does not, indeed, allow them to exist at all, the\nbright shining of the light invisible, that diffused illumination in\nwhich no shadow can be cast. And as in that walk we had on the downs,\nthe knowledge fills him not only with inward bliss, but with intense\nphysical enjoyment, so that he can be humorous over the horrors of\nexistence on that damned promontory. He is genuinely amused: for nobody\nwas ever such a poor hand at dissimulation as Francis. He finds things\nto enjoy in that hell; more than that, he finds that hell enjoyable:\nhis letter breathed that serenity of well-being which is the least\nimitable thing in the world.\n\nMeantime, he wants the news of everyday happenings, \"without any\nserious reflections, or the internal stomach-ache of pessimists.\"\nThese rather pointed remarks refer, I am afraid, to my last letter to\nhim, to which he does not otherwise allude. He quotes Mr. Longfellow's\nbest-known poem (I am afraid also) in the spirit of mockery, and says:\n\n        \"'Life is real, life is earnest,' and if you doubt it,\n        come out to Suvla Bay and see. We are damned earnest out\n        here, and I haven't seen anybody who doubts that Life is\n        extremely real: so are the flies. What I want to know\n        is the little rotten jokes and nonsense, the things you\n        talk about when you don't think what you are talking\n        about. Here's one: the other day I was opening a tin of\n        potted meat, and a bit of shrapnel came and took the\n        tin clean out of my hand. It didn't touch me; it simply\n        whisked it neatly away. Another inch and my hand would\n        have gone with it. But I hope you don't think I gave\n        thanks for the lucky escape I had had. Not a bit: I was\n        merely furious at losing the potted meat. It lay outside\n        the trench (a trench out here is a tea-spoonful of earth\n        and pebbles which you pile up in front of you, and then\n        hide yourself behind it), and I spent the whole of the\n        afternoon in casting for it, with a hook on a piece of\n        string. I was much more interested in that than in the\n        military operations. I wanted my potted meat, which\n        I think you sent me. Well, what I should like you to\n        write to me about, is the things that the part of me\n        which wanted the potted meat would like to hear about.\n        Patriotism and principles be blowed, bless them! That's\n        all taken for granted--'granted, I'm sure,' as the\n        kitchen-maid said.\n\n        \"Francis.\n\n        \"P.S.--You alluded to a grey parrot, in one letter. For\n        God's sake, tell me about the grey parrot. You just\n        mentioned a grey parrot, and then no more. Grey parrot\n        is what I want, and your cat, and all the little, rotten\n        things that are so tremendously important. Write me a\n        grey parrot letter.\"\n\nWell, the grey parrot is rather interesting ... and her name is\nMatilda, and if you want to know why she is Matilda, you have only\ngot to look at her. If words have any suggestiveness to your mind, if\nthere is to you any magic about them, or if they, unbidden, conjure\nup images, I should not be surprised if the word \"Matilda\" connoted\nto you a grey parrot. It would be more surprising if, when you become\nacquainted with my grey parrot, you did not become aware that she\n_was_ Matilda. I don't see how you can get away from the fact that she\nmust, in the essentials of her nature, be Matilda. Presently you will\nsee what Matilda-ism is: when it is stated, you will know that you\nknew it all along, but didn't know you knew it. The same sort of thing\nhappened to somebody, when he became aware that all his life he had\nbeen writing prose. And very good prose it was.... Here, then, begins\nthe introduction to Matilda-ism, in general terms to be applied later.\n\n\n        MATILDA-ISM\n\n        We all of us know (even the most consistent of us) those\n        baffling instincts which lead us to act in manners\n        incompatible with each other, simultaneously. That\n        is not so puzzling as it sounds (nor sounds quite as\n        ungrammatical as it is), and an instance will clarify\n        the principle. For who does not understand and in\n        measure sympathize with the careful housewife who\n        embarks on a two-shilling taxicab expedition in order\n        to purchase some small household commodity at sixpence\n        less than she could have bought it for across the road?\n        The motive of her expedition is economy, and therefore\n        she lashes out into bewildering expenditure in order to\n        achieve it. Economy, in fact, is the direct cause of her\n        indulging in totally unnecessary expenditure. She ties\n        herself to the stake with one hand, ready to be burned\n        for the sake of her faith, and offers incense to the\n        heathen gods with the other.\n\n        It is this strain of self-contradictory conduct that I\n        unhesitatingly label Matilda-ism, for, as far as I am\n        aware, there is no other succinct term in the English\n        language which sums up and expresses it. (Besides, it\n        is characteristic of my grey parrot, for as you shall\n        presently see, this is what Matilda does.) You cannot\n        explain this incompatibility of action and principle\n        otherwise: it is not vacillation, it is not infirmity\n        of purpose, for the economical housewife is one mass of\n        purpose and her motive is as pure as Parsifal. Simply\n        in pursuance of her economical design, she rushes into\n        expense. Nor is it the sign of a weak intellect, for\n        Matilda's grasp of a subject is, like Mrs. Micawber's,\n        inferior to none, and yet Matilda is the great example\n        of the quality which takes its name from her. She\n        does not spare thought and industry, perhaps, if\n        anything, she thinks too much, which may account for\n        the inadequacy of her plumage. She has been ill, too,\n        lately, which perhaps makes her plumage worse, for she\n        has been suffering from some obscure affection of the\n        brain. But since her illness her Matilda-ism has been\n        more marked than ever, and I prefer to think that it is\n        Thought which has accounted both for the illness and her\n        abnormal moultings. She had that rare disease, beloved\n        of novelists, called Brain-fever. People's hair, we are\n        told, falls out after brain-fever, and so did Matilda's\n        feathers. But I am sure that Matilda would sooner go\n        naked, than cease to think.\n\n        Unlike most women, Matilda does not care about her\n        clothes, and unlike most birds, she does not scoop and\n        preen herself after breakfast. She gives one shake,\n        and then settles down to her studies, which consist\n        in observing, with a scornful wonder, all that goes\n        on round her. When first she came here, she was in no\n        hurry to draw conclusions, or commit herself hastily\n        to irrevocable words, for she sat and waited without\n        speech for some six weeks, until I thought she was\n        either dumb or had nothing to say. Then, unlike Mr.\n        Asquith, she ceased to wait and see, and began calling\n        the kitchen-maid (Mabel) in a voice so like the cook's,\n        that that deluded young lady came running from the\n        scullery into the kitchen, to find no cook there at all,\n        at all, but only a grey parrot, that sat with stony,\n        half-closed eyes on her perch. Then, as she went out\n        again, believing that some discarnate intelligence had\n        spoken to her, Matilda laughed at her in a rude, hoarse\n        voice that was precisely like the milkman's, mewed like\n        the cat, and said \"Cuckoo\" a number of times. (This she\n        had learned last spring in the country, and was unaware\n        that there were no cuckoos in London ever, or even in\n        the country in November.) Matilda, in fact, with her\n        powerful intellect and her awful memory, had been taking\n        stock of everybody, and not telling anybody about it.\n        Now that it was well within her power to deal with every\n        situation that could possibly arise in a mocking manner,\n        she decided to begin talking and taking an active part,\n        that of the critic, in life. Simultaneously, she began\n        to reveal what Matilda-ism was. At this period, since\n        she was too accomplished to be limited to the kitchen, I\n        took her upstairs. I thought she would meet more people\n        there, and enlarge, if possible, a mind that was already\n        vast.\n\n        Her first definite elucidation of Matilda-ism was to\n        make love in the most abandoned manner to the green\n        parrot. She wooed him in the style that the Bishop of\n        L-nd-n so rightly deprecates, with loud Cockney whistles\n        and love-lorn eyes. Of course Joey seemed to like that,\n        and their cages were moved close together, in the hope\n        that eventually they would make a match of it, and that\n        most remarkable babies would chip the shells of their\n        eggs. Matilda continued to encourage him, and one day,\n        when their cages were now quite close to each other, the\n        green gentleman, trembling with excitement, put out a\n        horned claw, and introduced it into Matilda's cage. On\n        which Matilda screamed at the top of her voice and bit\n        it viciously. I thought at the time that this was only\n        an exhibition of the eternal feminine, which encourages\n        a man, and then is offended and indignant when he makes\n        the natural response to her invitations, but in the\n        light of subsequent events, I believe it to have been\n        Matilda-ism. She was not being a flirt, simply, while\n        she adored, she hated also. It was Matilda, you see: all\n        the time it was Matilda waiting to be classified.\n\n        Matilda knew perfectly well what a cat says: she knew,\n        too, that a cat is called \"Puss,\" and, putting two and\n        two together, she always said \"Meaow\" when you went to\n        her cage and said \"Puss.\" This is synthetic reasoning,\n        like that of the best philosophers, and, all the world\n        over, is taken as a mark of the highest intelligence.\n        Similarly, she knew that my dog is called Taffy, and (by\n        a converse process inaccessible to any but the finest\n        minds) if you went to her cage and said \"Bow-ow-ow,\"\n        she responded with the neatness of a versicle, \"Taffy,\n        Taffy, Taffy.\" But--and this is Matilda-ism--when Taffy\n        came near her cage she invariably mewed to him, and\n        when a cat came near her cage, she barked. She did not\n        confuse them; Matilda's brain shines illustriously above\n        the clouds of muddle. She preferred to abandon synthetic\n        reasoning, and create Matilda-ism.\n\n        I must insist on this, for all the evidence goes to\n        confirm it. For instance, if you pull a handkerchief\n        from your pocket, she makes rude noises which cannot\n        fail to remind you of the blowing of a nose oppressed by\n        catarrh. Also, when Mabel left, she learned the name of\n        the new kitchen-maid at once, and never made mistakes\n        about it. But as she increased in years and wisdom, her\n        ineradicable leanings towards Matilda-ism increased also.\n\n        Then came the crisis in her life, the brain-fever to\n        which I have alluded. She had a fit, and for five or\n        six days was seriously ill in the spare-room, set high\n        above the noises of the street, where no exciting sounds\n        could reach her. But she recovered, and her recovery\n        was held to be complete when from the spare-room where\n        she had undergone her rest-cure, a stream of polyglot\n        noises one morning issued forth. I took her back into\n        my sitting-room again, and reminded her of the European\n        War by saying, \"Gott strafe the Kaiser.\" I thought this\n        would bring her into touch with the world of to-day\n        again, but for a long time she remained perfectly\n        silent. But when I had said, \"Gott strafe the Kaiser\"\n        two or three hundred times, she burst into speech with a\n        loud preliminary scream.\n\n        \"Gott strafe Polly's head,\" she cried. \"Gott save the\n        King! Gott save the Kaiser! Gott scratch Polly's head.\n        Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord! Cuckoo! Cuckoo. Puss, Puss, Puss!\n        Bow-ow-ow!...\" And the poor demented bird laughed in\n        hoarse ecstasy, at having got in touch with synthetic\n        reasoning again!\n\n        Matilda-ism took control of all her thoughts. If a\n        tea-cup was presented to her notice, she blew her nose\n        loudly, though I cannot believe that she had ever seen\n        a tea-cup used as a handkerchief. When Joey was put\n        near her cage again she called him Taffy. She barked at\n        the kitchen-maid, and mewed at the cook, and called the\n        cat Mabel. All her correlations had gone wrong in that\n        attack of brain-fever, and though she had shown signs\n        of Matilda-ism before, I never thought it would come\n        to this. She was a voluble mass of contradictory and\n        irreconcilable propositions.\n\n        All this I wrote to Francis, since he desired domestic\n        and ridiculous information, but when the letter was\n        sealed and dispatched, I could not help thinking that\n        Matilda, real as she is, is chiefly a parable. It\n        is impossible, in fact, not to recollect that King\n        Constantine of Greece was very ill last spring (like\n        Matilda), and subsequently (i) invited the Allies to\n        land at Salonica, and (ii) turned M. Venizelos out of\n        office. It all looks traitorous, but perhaps it is mere\n        Matilda-ism. But I am not sure that it would not be\n        better for him to have some more brain-fever, and have\n        done with it.\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\n        A postscript must be added. I took Matilda into the\n        country, when I went there for a few days last week.\n        One morning she saw a ferret being taken out of a bag,\n        and instantly sang, \"Pop goes the Weasel.\" I think that\n        shows a turn for the better, some slight power of sane\n        synthesis lurks in the melody, for a ferret is a sort\n        of weasel. I am naturally optimistic, and cannot help\n        wondering whether a change of air might not produce a\n        similar amelioration in the case of King Constantine.\n        Russia, for instance....\n\nI had intended to keep these annals of Matilda detached from the war,\nbut it has wound its way in again, as King Charles's head invaded the\nchronicles of Mr. Dick. There is no getting away from it: if you light\na cigarette, you think of Turkey and the expedition to the Dardanelles;\nif you drink a glass of wine, you think of the trenches dug through\nthe vineyards of France. And yet, how little, actually, has the war\nentered into the vital parts of the mass of English people. To large\nnumbers, reckoned by thousands, it has made unhealable wounds, but into\nlarger numbers, reckoned by millions, no prick of the sword has really\npenetrated. I wonder when some kind of awakening will come, when to the\nendless dormitories of drowsy sleepers, some smell of the burning, some\nsound of the flaming beams above their heads and below them will pierce\ntheir dreams. I pray God that on that day there will be no terrified\nplucking from sleep into realities vastly more portentous than any\nnightmare, but an awakening from sloth into an ordered energy.\n\nBut up till now, a profound slumber, or at the most a slumber with\ncoloured dreams, has possessed the spirit of the nation. Occasionally\nsome sleeper, roused by the glare that burns sombrely on the placid\nnight of normal human existence, has awoke and has screamed out words\nof Pythian warning. But his troubled awakening has but annoyed the\nmyriads of other sleepers. One has growled out, \"Oh, for God's sake,\ngo to sleep again: there's the Navy;\" another has murmured, \"It's\nunpatriotic to be pessimistic;\" a third has whispered, \"God always\npermits us to muddle through.\" Sometimes the yell has startled another\ninto futile whimperings, but then some retired Colonel, who writes for\nthe papers, like a soft-slippered nurse, pads up to his bedside, and\nsays, \"Go to sleep again, dearie, I'm here,\" and the whimpering ceases,\nand the nurse pulls down the blind to keep the glare out of the eyes\nof the sleeper. Occasionally one of them makes such a to-do that an\nattendant hurries downstairs to fetch a member of the Government from\nthe room where they are having such a pleasant chat over their wine,\nand he is given a glass of port, and asked to come downstairs in his\ndressing-gown and join the amusing supper-party. Sometimes he goes,\nsometimes he drinks his wine and prefers to go to sleep again instead.\nI don't know what would happen if he refused to go downstairs, and\nsaid he would go on screaming. But no one at present contemplates such\nan upsetting contingency. Besides, there is always the Censor, Auntie\nCensor, who can be stern when sternness is really wanted, and spank any\nobstreperous screamer with a ruthless blue pencil.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEveryone knows that particular (and disagreeable) climatic condition,\nwhen, during a frost, thaw becomes imminent. It may still be freezing,\nbut there is something in the air which tells those who are susceptible\nto change just a little before change arrives that a thaw is\napproaching. The sensation cannot be accounted for by the thermometer,\nwhich still registers a degree or two of frost, but to those who have\nthis weather prescience, it is quite unmistakable. Similarly in affairs\nnot appealing to the merely physical sense, it sometimes happens that\npeople are aware of a coming event implying change, before there is any\nreal reason to justify their belief. This is so common a phenomenon\nthat it has even been crystallized into an awkwardly-worded proverb\nwhich informs us that coming events cast their shadow before (meaning\nlight), but to adopt the current phrase, there has lately been a great\ndeal of shadow projected from the Dardanelles, and it is now a matter\nof general belief that that ill-planned, ill-executed expedition is\nabout to be recalled, and that all the eager blood shed there will\nnow prove to have been poured out over an enterprise that shall be\nabandoned as unrealizable. For many months now hearts have been sick\nwith deferred hope, eyes dim with watching for the dawn that never\nbroke, and it seems probable that \"Too late\" is to be scrawled in red\nover another abortive adventure, now to be filed away among failures\nunder the appropriate letter D. It is idle to attempt to see any bright\nlining to the cloud which hangs over that accursed peninsula: all that\ncan be hoped is that the gallant souls who still hold a corner of it,\ndespite the misadventures, the miscalculations, the mismanagement that\nhave for months punctuated heroism with halts and full stops written in\ncrimson, will be bought off without the crowning record of some huge\ndisaster.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChristmas approaches, and the furnaces of the world-war are being\nstoked up to burn with a more hideous intensity, while village choirs\npractise their hymns and anthems about peace on earth, good will\ntowards men. Every decent Christian Englishman (_pace_ the pacifists)\nbelieves in the prime importance of killing as many Germans as\npossible, and yet no decent Christian Englishman will somehow fail to\nendorse with a genuine signature the message of the angelic host, even\nthough his fingers itch for the evening paper, which he hopes contains\nsome news of successful slaughter. That sounds like another instance\nof Matilda-ism, and mere discussion, as confined to the narrow sphere\nof rational argument, might easily leave the defender of such an\nattitude with not a leg to stand upon. But all the time (for argument\nat best can only prove what is not worth explaining) he will know at\nheart that his position has not been shaken by the apparent refutation,\nand he will give you his word (than which there is nothing greater and\nnothing less) that his contention, logically indefensible, is also\nunassailable. He can't explain, and it is better not to try. But he\nknows how it feels, which is more vital than knowing how to account for\nit. Logic and Euclid are not, after all, irrefutable, though they may\nbe, by human reason, the final guides to human conduct.\n\nEverything cannot be referred to reason as to a supreme arbiter. Reason\nwill lead you a long way across the plain, but beyond the plain there\nis, like a row of visionary blue mountains, a range of highland which\nis the abode of the riddles, the questions, the inconsistencies which\nare quite outside the level lands of reason. No one can tell why the\nOmnipotent Beneficence (some people hate to see the word God) ever\nallowed cancer and malarial mosquitoes and Prussian militarism to\nestablish themselves so firmly on the earth which is the Lord's. It is\nimpossible to explain this away, and unless you argue from the fact of\ntheir undoubted existence that there is no such thing as the Omnipotent\nBeneficence, and become that very silly thing called an atheist, the\nbest thing you can do (collectively) is to look for the germs of cancer\nwith a view to their destruction, cover with paraffin the breeding\nplaces of the mosquito, and help, if you have the good fortune still to\nbe useful, in the extermination of Prussian militarism. All these three\nthings are, very possibly, manifestations of the devil, and even if\nthey are not (improbable as it sounds), they are so like manifestations\nof the devil, that we are justified in mistaking them for such. I\nam quite convinced of that, and am impervious to any argument about\nit. I \"am in love and charity\" (in my microscopic degree) \"with my\nneighbours,\" but that would not prevent me killing a German with all\nthe good will in the world, if I was put in the firing line, any more\nthan it would prevent me squashing a malaria-carrying mosquito with\nmy Prayer Book. And if I could sing (which I can't) I would bellow\n\"Peace on earth, good will towards men,\" at the top of my voice, even\nwhile I was poising the Prayer Book or drawing a bead on the Prussians.\n\"Inconsistent,\" I daresay, but why be consistent? Besides, deep down, I\nknow it is consistent.\n\nYet, though we all recognize the essential consistency of this apparent\ninconsistency, how we long, as with the yearning for morning through\nthe dark hours of pain, for the time when such complication of instinct\nwill have vanished. Twelve leaden months have dropped sullenly, one by\none, into the well of time, salt with human tears, and those who were\noptimistic a year ago, believing that when Christmas next came round,\nEurope would have recovered from this madness of bloodshed, are less\nconfident in their outlook for another Christmas. But few, I think,\nif a stroke of the pen could give back to the world that menacing\ntranquillity which preceded the war, would put their name to so craven\na document. Now that we know what those faint and distant flashes of\nlightning meant in the years that saw us all sunk in the lethargy of\nopulent prosperity, now that we know what those veiled drowsy murmurs\nof thunder from Central Europe portended, we would not take in exchange\nfor the days of direst peril, the false security that preceded them.\nEven as America now is drunk with dollars, so that no massacre of her\ncitizens on the high seas will reduce her from the attitude of being\ntoo proud to fight, to the humbler office of resenting crimes that\nsend her defenceless citizens without warning to the bottomless depths\nof the Atlantic, so we, with our self-sufficiency and our traditional\nsense of supremacy, could not be bothered to listen to the warnings of\nthe approaching storm till with hail of fire it burst on us. Then, it\nis true, we ceased to dream, but ever since our kind nurses have done\ntheir best to cozen back those inert hours. \"I'm sitting up, dearie,\"\nthey say. \"Just wait and see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd at this point I will again pass over a year, that comprises the war\nevents of 1916. In the spring the great German attack against Verdun\nopened, and for months the French stood steadfast, until that hail\nof hammer blows exhausted itself. Early in June was fought the naval\nbattle of Jutland, announced by the German Press as so stupendous a\nvictory, that for the rest of the year their fleet sheltered in Kiel,\npresumably because they had destroyed the British naval supremacy for\never. In August came the fall of Gorizia, and next month the entry of\nRumania into the war, and a disastrous campaign followed. In Greece\nKing Constantine continued his treacherous manoeuvres, but failed to\nexhaust the patience of the Allies. In December, lastly, came the\nbombastic announcement that the invincible and victorious Germany was\nwilling from motives of magnanimous humanity, to grant peace to the\ncrushed and trampled Allies, who had dared to dispute the might of her\nGod-given destiny. A suitable reply was returned.\n\n\n\n\nJANUARY, 1917\n\n\nIt is a year since last I wrote anything in this book, and the year\nhas passed with such speed that I can scarcely believe that the ink\nof December is dry. Nothing makes time slide away so fast as regular\nmonotonous employment, and not only this year, but the year before\nthat, and five months before that, seem pressed into a moment, dried\nand flattened. But all the things that happened before that, when\nin August, 1914, the whole of one's consciousness was changed, is\nincredibly remote.\n\nThe war has made a cleavage across the continuity of life, and while\nthe mind and the conscious self get to be at home in the changed\nexistence, the line of cleavage does not become obliterated, but, on\nthe contrary, appears steeper and more sheer-sided. The edges of the\nchasm have been covered over with the green growth of habit, of the\nadjustment that alone renders fresh conditions possible; but further\nand further away becomes the consciousness that there was once a time\nin which all Europe was not at war. In those golden years people used\nto discuss, just as they would discuss ghosts or the approach of a\ncomet, the possibility of a German war, that would lead all Europe into\nthe gate of Hell. But it was discussed theoretically as a subject of\npolite conversation, when topics that were really of interest, like\nSuffragettes or Home Rule in Ireland, ran dry. You talked about the\ncomet, Halley's comet, that was going to destroy the world, and then\nyou talked about a European war, that was going to destroy the world.\nAnd then you played the guessing game.... It was all one: just a matter\nof remote possibilities, based on an idea that you did not believe\nin. And then it came, not Halley's comet, or a ghost, but the third\nincredible happening. All that was before has receded into dim ages.\nYou feel that \"once upon a time,\" as in stories you tell to children,\nthere was somebody else masquerading under your own name, and suppose\nthat as by some conjuring trick he was mysteriously identical with\nyou. If you were closely questioned you would allow that in 1913 you\ndid this or that; you wanted something (and perhaps got it); you lived\nin a house in a certain street, and were popularly supposed to be the\nsame person who lives in that or another house now. You would have to\nadmit these facts, but deep down in yourself you would cling to the\nsecret belief that it was somebody else who, under your name, did the\nthings and lived the life that is supposed to have been yours. A label\nwas attached to you then, which gave your name and address, and you\nfind the same label round your neck still. For the sake of convenience\nyou continue to answer to your name, and, in a manner of speaking,\nare responsible for the old lease. But all the time you feel that\nanother person wears the label now. A different identity (that is your\nprivate opinion) inhabits your house. He wears the same (or similar)\nboots and shoes; he comes when he is called; he has a face that is\nstill recognized by his friends. But though his friends recognize him,\nyou scarcely recognize him yourself. He, who was nurtured in peace,\nhas now but a remote memory of those tranquil years, and thinks they\nmust surely belong to someone else. All he knows now is that since\nthe foundation of the world he has lived in the midst of this grim\nstruggle, which, since the foundation of the world, was as inevitable\nas the succession of night and day. Before the storm broke, somebody\n(himself probably, since everyone else says so) knew only that life\nwas a pleasant business (or unpleasant, as the case may be), and that\nit would go on for a certain number of years, and that then an end\nwould come to it. It was all very jolly, and a railway strike or the\nrise of the income-tax to, say, one and sixpence in the pound was the\nsum of the inconvenience ahead. In due time he would get pneumonia or\ncancer, or be run over by a motor-bus; but all those disheartening\npossibilities seemed quite remote. Then came the war, and it cleaved\nhis former life from his present life as by an impassable chasm. That\nbeing so, he adjusted himself to his present life, and, if he was wise,\nceased to waste time over thinking of the \"jolly days\" which preceded\nthe changed conditions. And if he was wiser still, he did not throw\nthe memory of the \"jolly days\" away, but put them in a box and locked\nit up. And if he was wisest of all, he said: \"I am different, but the\neternal things are not different,\" and went on just as usual.\n\nIndeed, why you do a thing matters far more than what you do. It is\neasy to conceive of a thoroughly lethargic person who, for mere want of\nvitality, lives a most respectable life. He has not energy enough--and\nthereby is less of a man--to commit the usual errors. But the question\nseriously arises as to whether he had not better be more of a man and\ncommit them. I hasten over this difficult phase, and conceive of him\nagain as more vital than ever, and abstaining from the usual crimes\nbecause he is now above them rather than below them. He looks down on\nthem instead of gazing feebly up at them. In actual result, his conduct\nas regards errors is the same, but who can doubt about the respective\nvalues of the respective conducts? The two are poles apart (though in\nnet and tangible result the extremes meet), for no one can say that the\nman who does not cheat at cards simply from fear of detection has the\nsmallest spiritual affinity with the average person who plays honestly\nbecause he is honest.\n\nThere is a periodical piece of business in shops and places where they\nsell things, called stock-taking, and, as its name implies, it consists\nin the owner going through the goods and seeing what he has got. It\nis a useful custom, not only in shops, but as applied by ordinary\nindividuals to themselves, and the first day of a New Year is a date\ncommonly in use as the day of internal stock-taking. Very sensible\npeople will tell you that the division of one's life into years is a\npurely arbitrary arrangement, and that December 31st is not severed\nfrom January 1st by any more real division than July 3rd is severed\nfrom July 4th. But less superbly-constituted minds fall back on these\narbitrary arrangements, and with the sense that they are starting\nagain on January 1st, they often have a look round their cupboards\nand shelves to see what they have in hand. It is a disagreeable sort\nof business; you will find that your things have got very dusty and\ndirty, and that probably there is much that should be thrown away and\nbut little that is worth keeping when you run over your record for the\npast year. But far more important than your actual conduct (as in the\ncase of the two very different gentlemen, neither of whom cheats at\ncards) is the motive that inspired your conduct. If you are lucky you\nwill perhaps find that you have done a certain number of good-natured\nthings; you may have done some generous ones, but if you are wise,\nyou will, before you let a faint smile of satisfaction steal over\nyour mobile features, consider why you did them. You may have been\ngood-natured out of kindness of heart; all congratulations if it is so;\nbut you may find you have been good-natured out of laziness, in which\ncase I venture to congratulate you again on having brought that fact\nhome to yourself.... Indeed, this search for motive rather resembles\nwhat happens when you turn over a prettily marked piece of rock lying\non the grass. It _may_ be all right, but sometimes you discover\nhorrible creepy-crawlies below it, which, when disturbed, scud about\nin a disconcerting manner. Or again (which is more encouraging), you\nmay come across an object--a piece of conduct, that is to say--which\nreally makes you blush to look at it. But possibly, when you turn it\nover you may find that you really meant rather well, in spite of your\ndeplorable behaviour. Hoard that encouragement, for you will want as\nmuch encouragement as you can possibly find if you intend to do your\nstock-taking honestly; otherwise, you will assuredly not have the\nspirit to go through with it. And when the stock-taking is done look\nat the total, which will certainly be very disappointing, without\ndismay, but with a sanguine hope that you will find a better show next\nyear. Think it over well, and then dismiss the whole thing from your\nconscious mind. For to dwell too much on your stock-taking, or to take\nstock too often, produces a paralysing sort of self-consciousness.\nThe man who sets his past failures continually before him is not\nlikely to be much better in the future; while he who contemplates his\npast successes gets fat and inert with probably quite ill-founded\ncomplacency. One of the shrewdest philosophers who ever lived gives\nvery sage advice on this point when he says: \"And when he hath done all\nthat is to be done, as far as he knoweth, let him think that he hath\ndone nothing.\"... So we, who have not done one tithe of the things that\nwe knew we ought to have done, will certainly have little excuse for\nthinking we have done something.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother effect of this last year of tension, besides that of sundering\nour present lives and consciousness from pre-war days, is that it has\nmade a vast quantity of people very much older. That has advantages\nand disadvantages, for while there are certainly many very admirable\nthings connected with the sense of youth, there are some which are\nnot so admirable when manifested by those of mature and middle age.\nIt is admirable, for instance, that the middle-aged should have\nenough vitality to devote themselves to learning the fox-trot, or the\nbunny-bump, but it is less admirable that they should actually spend\ntheir vitality in doing so. The war has taken the wish to bunny-bump\nout of them, the desire for bunny-bumping has failed, and that has\ncaused them to realize that they are not quite so young as they\nthought, or as they proposed to be for the next twenty years or so. The\nsense of middle-age has come upon them as suddenly as the war itself\ncame, and many have found it extremely disconcerting. It is as if they\nwere introduced to a perfect stranger, whom they have to take into\ntheir house and live with. They don't like the look of the stranger,\nnor his manners, nor his habits, and this infernal intruder does not\npropose, they feel, to make a short visit, but has come to stop with\nthem permanently. He eats and walks and reads with them, and when they\nwake up at night they see his head on their pillow. He seems to them\nungracious and angular and forbidding; they dearly long to get away\nfrom him, but that is impossible. What, then, are they to do? There is\nonly one thing to be done, to make friends with him without loss of\ntime, and never to regret the vanishing of the jolly days before he\ncame. If they had been wise (hardly anybody is in this respect), they\nwould have made friends with him long before he came as a permanent\nguest; they would have asked him to lunch, so to speak, on one day, and\ngone out a walk with him on another, and have thus got accustomed to\nhis ways by degrees. But as they have not done that, they must resign\nthemselves to a period of discomfort now.\n\nProbably they will find that he is much easier to get on with than they\nthink at first. They fancy that they will never be happy again with\nthat old bore always at their elbows, and it is quite true that they\nnever will be happy again in the old way. They must find a new way, and\nthe first step towards that is not to call this guest, middle-age, an\nold bore, but discover what he can do, and what his good points are. He\nreally has a good many, if you take the trouble to look for them. He\nhas not got the tearing high spirits which they are accustomed to, but\nhe has a certain serenity which is far from disagreeable if you will be\nat the pains to draw it out. He is not very quick, he has but little\nof that quality compounded of wit and activity and nonsense which they\nwere wont to consider the basis of all social enjoyment; but he has\na certain rather kindly humour which gives a twinkle to the eye that\nsparkles no longer. He has boiled down his experiences, sad and joyful\nalike, into a sort of broth which is nutritive and palatable, though\nwithout bubble. But patience is one of its excellent ingredients, a\nwholesome herb, which, for all its homeliness, has a very pleasant\ntaste. He can be a very good friend, not liable to take offence, and\nthough his affections are not passionate, they are very sincere.\n\nBut if you refuse to see his good points, and will not make friends\nwith him (he will always allow you to do that; it is \"up to you\"), he\nwill prove himself a very cantankerous old person indeed. He will give\nyou the most annoying reminders of his presence, digging you with his\nskinny elbow, and making all sorts of sarcastic interruptions when you\nare talking. You will get to hate him more and more, for he will always\nbe spoiling your pleasure until you are cordially inclined towards\nhim. He will trip you up in the bunny-bump; he will give you aches and\npains if you persist in behaving as if you were twenty-five still; he\nwill make you feel very unwell if you choose to eat lobster-salad at\nsunrise. And you can't get rid of him; the more strenuously you deny\nhis existence, the more indefatigably he will remind you of it. He is\nquite a good friend, in fact, but a perfectly pernicious enemy. But\nnaturally you will do what you choose about him, as you have always\ndone about everything else....\n\nTo revert to Francis (a far more exhilarating subject than New Year\nreflections), he was at home for a few days last week. After the\nDardanelles expedition was abandoned, he went out to France (after\nhaving condescended to accept a commission), where he proceeded at\nonce to earn the V.C. for a deed of ludicrous valour, under a storm of\nmachine-gun bullets, and while on leave received his decoration.\n\n\"Of course I like it awfully,\" was his comment about it; \"but, as a\nmatter of fact, I didn't deserve it, because on that particular morning\nI didn't happen to be frightened. I usually am frightened, and I've\ndeserved the V.C. millions of times, but just when I got it I didn't\ndeserve it. They ought to give the V.C. to fellows who are in the devil\nof a fright all the time they are doing their job. But that day I\nwasn't; I had had a delicious breakfast, and felt as calm as Matilda is\nlooking. I don't believe she can speak a word by the way; you made it\nall up.\"\n\nI was very much mortified by Matilda's conduct. Ever since Francis's\nreturn she had sat in dead silence, though I had taught her to say\n\"Hurrah for the V.C.,\" and she had repeated it without stopping for\nseveral hours the day before he arrived. But the moment she saw\nhim, she looked at him with a cold grey eye and remained absolutely\nspeechless. Of course I did not tell Francis what I had taught her to\nsay, because she might take it into her head to begin to talk at any\ntime, and her congratulations would not then be a surprise to him. So\nI held my tongue, and Matilda hers.\n\nThen a most unfortunate incident occurred, for Francis left his\ndecoration in a taxi next day, and though we telephoned to all the\ntaxi-ranks and police-stations in the world, we could hear nothing of\nit. I don't think I ever saw anyone so furious as he was.\n\n\"No one will believe I got it,\" he shouted. \"I meant to wear it day\nand night, so that even a burglar coming into the house should see it.\nBut now no one will know. I can't go about chanting 'I am a V.C., but\nI left it in a taxi.' Who would believe such a cock-and-bull story? If\nyou heard a fellow in the street saying 'I am a V.C.,' you wouldn't\nbelieve him. Of course there's the riband, but it was the Cross I\nwanted to wear day and night--nobody looks at an inch of riband. Don't\nlaugh.\"\n\nMatilda suddenly cleared her throat, and blew her nose, which is often\nthe prologue to conversation. I sincerely hoped she wouldn't say\n\"Hurrah for the V.C.\" just this moment, for it really seemed possible\nthat the enraged Francis might wring her neck if she mocked at him. I\nhastened to talk myself, for Matilda usually waits for silence before\nshe scatters her pearls of wisdom.\n\n\"Well, apply for another one,\" I said. \"They'll surely give you another\none. Or earn another one, but apply first.\"\n\n\"And how many years do you think I should have to wait for it?\" he\nasked. \"How many departments do you think I should have to visit? How\nmany papers and affidavits do you think I should have to sign? Apply\nfor another one, indeed, as if the V.C. was only a pound of sugar!\"\n\n\"Only a pound of sugar!\" I said. \"Certainly, if it takes as long as it\ntakes to get a pound of sugar----\"\n\nMatilda gave a loud shriek.\n\n\"Gott strafe the V.C.!\" she screamed. \"Hurrah for Germany! Gott scratch\nthe Kaiser's head! Bow, wow, wow, wow, wow! Pussy!\"\n\nFrancis stopped dead and turned his head slowly round to where Matilda\nwas screaming like a Pythian prophetess. She whistled like the milkman,\nshe cuckooed, she called on her Maker's name, and on Taffy's; in a\ncouple of minutes she had said everything she had ever known, and mixed\nthe V.C. up with them all. She laughed at the V.C.; she blew her nose\nat him, accompanying these awful manifestations of Matilda-ism with\ndancing a strange Brazilian measure on her perch. Then she stopped as\nsuddenly as if her power of speech had been blown out like a candle,\nand hermetically sealed her horny beak for all conversational purposes\nfor precisely three weeks.\n\nFrancis had stuffed his handkerchief into his mouth, so that his\nlaughter should not interrupt Matilda, and got so red in the face I was\nafraid he was going to have a fit. But when she definitely stopped, he\ntook the handkerchief out of his mouth, and laughed till exhaustion set\nin.\n\n\"O Lord! I'm so glad Matilda is true!\" he said. \"I was half afraid you\nmight have invented her, though I was surprised at the impeccable art\nof your invention.\"\n\n\"Why surprised?\" I asked coldly.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. The ordinary reason. But she's really more like\nthe British public than King Tino. They get things more mixed up than\nanyone I ever came across. For instance, they think that they ought to\nbe very grave and serious, because the war is very grave and serious.\nWhy, there's Matilda-ism for you! The only possible way of meeting\na grave situation is to meet it gaily, and they would learn that if\nthey came out to the trenches. Unless you were flippant there you\nwould expire with depression. They are beavers at work, I allow that,\nbut when the day's work is over they ought to be compelled to amuse\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"But they don't feel inclined to,\" said I.\n\n\"No, and I don't feel inclined to get up in the morning, but that is no\njustification for lying in bed. There ought to be an amusement-board,\nwhich should make raids on private houses, if they suspected that\nunseemly seriousness was practised there. People talk of unseemly\nmirth, but they don't realize that gloom, as a general rule, is much\nmore unseemly. Besides, you don't arrive at anything like the proper\noutput of work if it is done by depressed people. Also, the quality of\nit is different.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that a shell made by cheerful munition workers has a\ngreater explosive force than when it has been made by the melancholy?\"\nI asked.\n\n\"I daresay that is the case, and it would account for the fact that\nthe Boches' shells haven't been nearly so devastating lately, because\nbeyond doubt the Boches are a good deal depressed. There is a marked\nsluggishness stealing into their explosives. If you want to do a good\nday's work on Thursday, by far the best preparation you can make for\nit is to have a howling, jolly time on Wednesday evening. Pleasure\ngives you energy, and pleasure is every bit as _real_ as pain, and\ncheerfulness as depression. I know you will say that it is the\nfogs that make people depressed, but it is more likely, as someone\nsuggested, that the depressed people make the fogs. If so, I don't\nwonder at the impenetrable state of affairs outside.\"\n\nHe pointed at the window, which, as far as purposes of illumination\nwent, was about as useful as the wall. Since dawn no light had broken\nthrough that opaque cloud of brown vapour; a moonless night was not\ndarker than this beleaguered noonday. It had penetrated into the house\nand veiled the corners of the room in obscurity, and filled eyes and\nnose with smarting ill-smelling stuff.\n\n\"Yes, decidedly it's the depressed people who make the fog,\" said he.\n\"They are the same thing on two different planes, for they both refuse\nto admit the sunshine.\"\n\n\"But, good heavens, aren't you ever depressed?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not inside. I don't count surface depression, which can be easily\nproduced by an aching tooth, though, indeed, I haven't got much\nexperience of that. But I am never fundamentally depressed; I never\ndoubt that behind the clouds is the sun still shining, as that odious\nschool-marm Longfellow tells us. Often things are immensely tiresome,\nbut tiresome things, painful things, have no root. They don't penetrate\ndown to the central reality. But all happiness springs from it.\nEven mere pleasure is as real as pain, as I said just now; but joy,\nhappiness, is infinitely more real than either. But somehow--I don't\nquite understand this, though I know it's true--somehow happiness\ncasts a shadow, like a tree growing in the sunshine. Thomas \u00c3\u00a0 Kempis,\nas usual, is quite right when he says, 'Without sorrow none liveth in\nlove.' But that sorrow is a thing that passes; it wheels with the sun;\nit is not steadfast; it is not everlasting. But it's the devil to try\nto describe that which from its very nature is indescribable. Only\nthere are so many excellent folk who think that the shadow is more real\nthan the object which causes it.\"\n\nHe came and sat on the hearth-rug, where presently he stretched himself\nat length.\n\n\"And yet some of the best people who have ever lived,\" he said,\n\"have experienced what they call the darkness of the soul. The\nwhole of their belief in God and in love, all that has made them far\nthe happiest creatures on the earth, suddenly leaves them. Their\nnaked souls are left in outer darkness; they are convinced in their\nown minds--minds, I say--that there is nothing in the world except\ndarkness. And their souls must remain perfectly steadfast, clinging in\nthis freezing blindness to the conviction that it can't be so, that\nall their senses and their reasoning powers are wrong. Nothing can\nhelp them except their own unaided faith, from which all support seems\nwithdrawn. Job had it pretty badly. It must be beastly, for you can't\nguess at the time what is the matter with you. Your mind simply tells\nyou that it has become a reasoned and convinced atheist. It's a sort of\npossession; the devil, for some inscrutable reason, is allowed to enter\ninto you, and he's an awful sort of tenant. He's so plausible too, so\nconvincing. He gets hold of your mind and says, 'Just chuck overboard\nall that you once blindly believed, and now clear-sightedly know to be\nfalse. You needn't bother yourself to curse God and die, because there\nisn't such a thing as God. And instead of dying live and thoroughly\nenjoy yourself.' That sounds ridiculous to you and me, whose minds the\ndevil doesn't entirely possess, but imagine what it would be if your\nmind had his spell cast on it, if all you had ever believed drifted\naway from you, and left you in the outer darkness. It would sound\nexcellent advice then. Your mind would tell you that there was nothing\nbeyond the mere material pleasures of the world. It would seem very\nfoolish not to make the most of them, regardless of everything else, if\nthere was nothing else.\"\n\n\"But all atheists are not unbridled hedonists,\" said I.\n\n\"More fools they. At least, from my point of view, the only possible\nbridle on one's carnal and material desires is the fact that one is not\nan atheist. What does the progress of mankind amount to considered by\nitself? A few scientific inventions, a little less small-pox. Is it for\nthat that unnumbered generations have lived and suffered and enjoyed?\"\n\n\"But can't atheists believe in and work for the progress of the world?\"\nI asked.\n\n\"I know they do, but for the life of me I can't see why. I wouldn't\nstir a finger or make a single act of renunciation if all that inspired\nme was the welfare of the next generation. To me the brotherhood of man\nis a meaningless phrase unless it is coupled with the fatherhood of\nGod.\"\n\n\"But you left Alatri, you went to fight, you won the V.C. you left in a\ntaxi for the sake of men.\"\n\n\"No, for the sake of what they stood for,\" he said. \"For the sake of\nthat of which they are the manifestation.\"\n\nHe got up and looked at his watch.\n\n\"Blow it! I've got to go and see the manifestation known as the War\nOffice,\" he said.\n\n\"After which?\" I asked. \"Will you be back for lunch?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so. Lord, I wish I wasn't going to the War Office,\nspecially since you have a morning off. Why shouldn't I say that\nI'm tired of the war--I might telephone it--or that I have become a\nconscientious objector, or that I've got an indisposition?\"\n\n\"There's the telephone,\" said I.\n\nHe buckled his belt.\n\n\"Wonderful thing the telephone,\" he said. \"And what if it's true that\nthere's another telephone possible: I mean the telephone between the\npeople whom we think of as living, and the people whom we don't really\nthink of as dead? I'm going to lunch with an Aunt, by the way, who is\nsteeped in spiritual things; so much so, indeed, that she forgets that\nthe chief spiritual duties, as far as we know them for certain, are to\nbe truthful and cheerful, and all those dull affairs which liars and\npessimists say that anybody can do. Aunt Aggie doesn't do any of them;\nshe's an awful liar and a hopeless pessimist, and her temper--well! But\nas I said, or didn't I say it--I'm going to lunch with her and go to a\n_s\u00c3\u00a9ance_ afterwards. She's going to inquire after Uncle Willy, who was\nno comfort to her in this life; but perhaps he'll make up for that now.\nReally London is getting rather cracked, which is the most sensible\nthing it ever did. I think it's the cold stodgy granite of the English\ntemperament which I dislike so. But really it's getting chipped, it's\ngetting cracked. Aunt Aggie bows to the new moon just like a proper\nItalian, and wouldn't sit down thirteen to dinner however hungry she\nwas. Oh, there are flaws in Aunt Aggie's granite, and she does have\nsuch horrible food! Good-bye.\"\n\nI settled down with a book, and an electric light at my elbow, and\na large fire at my feet, to the entrancing occupation of not doing\nanything at all. The blessed sixth morning of the week had arrived,\nwhen I was not obliged to go out to a large chilly office after\nbreakfast, and I mentally contrasted the nuisance of having to go out\ninto a beastly morning with the bliss of not having to go out, and\nfound the latter was far bigger with blessing than the former with\nbeastliness. I needn't read my book. I needn't do anything that I did\nnot want to do, but very soon the book, that I had really taken up for\nfear of being surprised by a servant doing nothing at all, began to\nengross me. It was concerned with the inexplicable telephone to which\nFrancis had alluded, and contained an account of the communications\nwhich had been made by a young soldier killed in France with his\nrelatives. As Francis had said, London had got cracked on the\nsubject....\n\nAfter all, what wonder? Were there the slightest chance of establishing\ncommunication between the living and the dead, what subject (even the\nwar) would be worthier of the profoundest study and experiment? Nothing\nmore interesting, nothing more vitally important, could engross us,\nfor which of the affairs in this world could be so important as the\nestablishment, scientifically and firmly, of any facts that concern the\nnext world? For there is one experience, namely, death, that is of\nabsolutely universal interest. Everything else, from my little finger\nto Shakespeare's brain, only concerns a certain number of people;\nwhereas death concerns the remotest Patagonian. However strongly and\nsincerely we may happen to believe that death is not an extinguishing\nof the essential self, with what intense interest we must all grab at\nanything which can throw light on the smallest, most insignificant\ndetail of the life that is hereafter lived? Or, if your mind is so\nconstructed that you do not believe in the survival of personality, how\ninfinitely more keenly you would clutch at the remotest evidence (so\nlong as it _is_ evidence) that there is something to follow after the\nearth has been filled in above the body, from which, we are all agreed,\n_something_ has departed. Without prejudice, without bias either of\nchild-like faith or convinced scepticism, and preserving only an open\nmind, willing to be convinced by reasonable phenomena, there is nothing\nsublunar or superlunar that so vitally concerns us. You may not care\nabout the treatment of leprosy, presumably in the belief that you will\nnot have leprosy; you may not care about Danish politics in the belief\nthat you will never be M.P. (if there is such a thing) for Copenhagen.\nBut what cannot fail to interest you is the slightest evidence of what\nmay occur to you when you pass the inevitable gates.\n\nThere are only two things that can possibly happen: the one is complete\nextinction (in which case I allow that the subject is closed, since if\nyou are extinguished it is idle to inquire what occurs next, since\nnothing can occur); the other is the survival, in some form, of life,\nof yourself. This falls into three heads:\n\n        (_i_) Reincarnation, as an earwig, or a Hottentot, or an\n        emperor.\n\n        (_ii_) Mere absorption into the central furnace of life.\n\n        (_iii_) Survival of personality.\n\nAnd here the personal equation comes in. I cannot really believe I\nam going to be an earwig or an emperor. To my mind that sounds so\nunlikely that I cannot fix serious thought upon it. What shall I, this\nMe, do when I am an earwig or an emperor? How shall I feel? The mind\nslips from the thought, as you slip on ice, and falls down. Nor can\nI conceive being absorbed into the central furnace, because that, as\nfar as personality goes, is identical with extinction. My soul will be\nburned in the source of life, just as my body may perhaps be burned\nin a crematorium, and I don't really care, in such a case, what will\nhappen to either of them.\n\nBut my unshakeable conviction, with regard to which I long for\nevidence, is that I--something that I call I--will continue a perhaps\nless inglorious career than it has hitherto pursued. And if you\nassemble together a dozen healthy folk, who have got no idea of dying\nat present, you will find that, rooted in the consciousness of at least\neleven of them, if they will be honest about themselves, there is this\nsame immutable conviction that They Themselves will neither have been\nextinguished or reincarnated or absorbed when their bodies are put away\nin a furnace or a churchyard. There is the illusion or conviction of a\nvast majority of mankind that with the withdrawal from the body of the\nSomething which has kept it alive, that Something does not cease to\nhave an independent and personal existence.\n\nWell, there has been lately an enormous increase in the number of those\nwho seek evidence on this overwhelmingly interesting subject. The\nbook which I have been reading and wondering over treats of it, and\nFrancis has gone with his Aunt Aggie to seek it. There has been, too,\nit is only fair to say, an enormous increase in the exasperation of\nthe folk who, knowing nothing whatever about the subject, and scorning\nto make any study of what they consider such hopeless balderdash,\ncondemn all those who have an open mind on the question as blithering\nidiots, hoodwinked by the trickery of so-called mediums. Out of their\nown inner consciousness they know that there can be no such thing as\ncommunication between the living and the dead, and there's the end of\nthe matter. All who think there possibly may be such communication are\nfools, and all who profess to be able to produce evidence for it are\nknaves.... They themselves, being persons of sanity and common-sense,\nknow that it is impossible.\n\nBut other shining examples of sanity and common-sense would undoubtedly\nhave affirmed thirty years ago, with the same pontifical infallibility,\nthat such a thing as wireless telegraphy was impossible, or a hundred\nyears ago that it was equally ridiculous to think that a sort of big\ntea-kettle could draw a freight of human beings along iron rails\nat sixty miles an hour. But wireless telegraphy and express trains\n_happened,_ in spite of their sanity and common-sense, and it seems\nto me that if we deny the possibility of this communication between\nthe living and the dead, we are acting in precisely the same manner as\nthose same sensible people would have acted thirty and a hundred years\nago.\n\nAnother favourite assertion of the sane and sensible is that if they\ncould get evidence themselves (though they foam with rage at the very\nnotion of attempting to do such a thing) they would believe it. That is\nprecisely the same thing as saying you will not believe in Australia\ntill you have been there. For the existence of Australia depends (for\nthose who have never seen it) on the evidence of others. The evidence\nfor the existence of Australia is overwhelming, and therefore we\nare right to accept it, even though we have not seen it ourselves.\nKangaroos and gold, and Australian troops and postage-stamps, and\nthe voyages of steamers, makes its existence absolutely certain;\nthere is no doubt whatever about it. And the evidence in favour of\nthe possibility of communication between this world and another\nnon-material world is now in process of accumulation. It is being\nstudied by people who are eminent in the scientific world, and it seems\nthat there are fragments, scraps of evidence, which must be treated\nwith the respect of an open mind by all who have not the pleasant gift\nof the infallibility that springs from complete ignorance. It is no\nlonger any use to quote from Mr. Sludge the Medium....\n\nThere are a great many gullible people in the world and a great many\nfraudulent ones, and when the two get together round a table in a\ndarkened room, it is obvious that there is a premium on trickery.\nBut because a certain medium is a knave and a vagabond, who ought to\nbe put in prison, and others are such as should not be allowed to go\nout, except with their minds under care of a nurse, it does not follow\nthat there are no such things as genuine manifestations. It would be\nas reasonable to say that because a child does his multiplication\nsum wrong, there is something unsound in the multiplication table. A\nfraudulent medium does not invalidate a possible genuineness in those\nwho are not cheats; a quack or a million quacks do not cast a slur\non the science of medicine. In questions of spiritualism there is no\ndenying that the number of quacks exposed and unexposed is regrettably\nlarge, and, without doubt, all spiritualistic phenomena should be\nruthlessly and pitilessly scrutinized. But when this is done, it is\nonly a hide-bound stupidity that refuses to treat the results with\nrespect.\n\nOther reservations must be made. All results that can conceivably\nbe accounted for by such well-established phenomena as telepathy or\nthought-reading must be unhesitatingly ruled out. They are deeply\ninteresting in themselves, they are like the traces of other metals\ndiscovered in exploring a gold-reef, but they are not the gold, and\nhave no more to do with the thing inquirers are in quest of than have\nacid-drops or penny buns. Many mediums (so-called) are not mediums at\nall, but have that strange and marvellous gift of being able to explore\nthe minds of others....\n\nWhat is the working and mechanism of that group of phenomena, among\nwhich we may class hypnotism, thought-reading, telepathy, and so forth,\nwe do not rightly know. But inside the conscious self of every human\nbeing there lurks the sub-conscious or subliminal self, which has\nsomething to do with all these things. Every event that happens to a\nman, every thought that passes through his mind, every impression that\nhis brain receives makes a mark on it, similar, perhaps, to the minute\ndots on phonograph records. That phonograph record (probably) is in\nthe keeping of the sub-conscious mind, and though the conscious mind\nmay have forgotten the fact, and the circumstances in the making of\nany of these marks, the sub-conscious mind has it recorded, and, under\ncertain conditions, can produce it again. And it is the sub-conscious\nmind which without doubt exercises those thought-reading and telepathic\nfunctions. In most people it lies practically inaccessible; others,\nnumerically few, appear, in trance or even without the suspension of\nthe conscious mind, to be able to exercise its powers, and--leaving out\nthe mere conjuring tricks of fraudulent persons--it is they who pass\nfor mediums.\n\nWhat happens? This: A bereaved mother or a bereaved wife sits with one\nof those mediums. The medium goes into a genuine trance, and probing\nthe mind of the eager expectant sitter, can tell her all sorts of\nintimate details about the husband or son who has been killed which are\nalready known to her. The medium can produce his name, his appearance;\ncan recount events and happenings of his childhood; can even say things\nwhich the mother has forgotten, but which prove to be true. Is it\nany wonder that the sitter is immensely impressed? She is more than\nimpressed, she is consoled and comforted when the medium proceeds to\nadd (still not quite fraudulently) messages of love and assurance of\nwell-being. It is not quite conscious fraud; it is perhaps a fraud of\nthe sub-conscious mind.\n\nNow all this, these reminiscences, these encouraging messages from the\nother world, have to be ruled out if we want to get at the real thing.\nThey are phenomena vastly interesting in themselves, but they are\nclearly accountable for by the established theory of thought-reading.\nThey need have nothing whatever to do with communications from\ndiscarnate spirits, for they can be accounted for by a natural law\nalready known to us. They do not help in the slightest degree to\nestablish the new knowledge for which so many are searching....\n\nFrancis had come back from his lunch and his _s\u00c3\u00a9ance_ with Aunt Aggie,\nand a considerable part of these reflections are really a _pr\u00c3\u00a9cis_ of\nour discussion. It had been quite a good thought-reading _s\u00c3\u00a9ance:_\nUncle Willy, through the mouth of the medium in trance, had affirmed\nhis dislike of parsnips and mushrooms, had mentioned his name, and\nnickname, Puffin, by which Aunt Aggie had known him, and had described\nwith extraordinary precision the room where he used to sit.\n\n\"I was rather impressed,\" said Francis. \"It really was queer, for\nsilly though Aunt Aggie is, I don't think she had previously gone to\nAmber--yes, the medium was Amber, just Amber--and primed her with\nregard to this information. Amber read it all right out of Aunt Aggie's\nmind. But then Uncle Willy became so extremely unlike himself that I\ncouldn't possibly believe it was Uncle Willy; it must have been a sort\nof reflection of what Aunt Aggie hoped he had become. He was deeply\nedifying; he said he was learning to be patient; he told us that he\nhad improved wonderfully. Poor Aunt Aggie sobbed, and I knew she loved\nsobbing. It made her feel good inside. All the same----\" He let himself\nlie inertly on the sofa, in that supreme bodily laziness which, as I\nhave said, gives his mind the greater activity.\n\n\"It was all a thought-reading _s\u00c3\u00a9ance_,\" he said, \"quite good of its\nkind, but it had no more to do with the other world than Matilda....\nBut why shouldn't there be a way through between the material and the\nspiritual, just as there is a way for telegraphy, as you said, without\nwires? Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, no doubt, a so-called\nmessage from the other side is only a subtle intercommunication between\nminds on this side. It's so hard to guard against that. But it might be\ndone. We might think of some piece of knowledge known only to a fellow\nwho was dead.\"\n\nSuddenly he jumped up.\n\n\"I've thought of a lovely plan,\" he said. \"Go for a walk, if you\nhaven't been out all day, or go and have a bath or something; and while\nyou are gone I'll prepare a packet, and seal it up in a box. Nobody\nwill know but me. And then when the next bit of shrapnel comes along\nand hits me instead of the potted-meat tin, you will pay half-a-guinea,\nI think it is--I know I paid for Aunt Aggie and myself--and see if a\nmedium can tell you what is in that box. Nobody will know except me,\nand I shall be dead, so it really will look very much as if I had a\nhand in it if a medium in trance can tell you what is in it. A box\ncan't telepathize, can it? The Roman Catholics say it's devil-work\nto communicate with the dead; they say all sorts of foul spirits get\nhold of the other end of the telephone. Isn't it lucky we aren't Roman\nCatholics?\"\n\n\"And what about the War Office?\" I said, chiefly because I didn't want\neither to go out or have a bath.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot. I'm going to be sent out to the Italian front. We've\ngot some people there, and it seems they don't know Italian very well.\nI don't know what I shall be quite: I think a sort of Balaam's ass\nthat talks, a sort of mule perhaps with a mixed Italian and English\nparentage. Duties? Ordering dinner, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Lucky devil!\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. I think I would sooner take my chance in the trenches.\nBut off I go day after to-morrow. Lord, if I get a week's leave now and\nthen, shan't I fly to Alatri! Can't you come out, too, to look after\nyour Italian property? Fancy having a week at Alatri again! There won't\nbe bathing, of course; but how I long to hear the swish and bang of the\nshutters that Pasqualino has forgotten to hitch to, in the Tramontana!\nAnd the sweeping of the wind in the stone-pine! And the glow and\ncrackle of the wood-fire on the hearth! And the draughty rooms! And the\nspringing up of the freesias! And Seraphina, fat Seraphina, and the\nsmell of frying! Fancy being _heedless_ again for a week! I feel sure\nthe war has never touched the enchanted island. The world as it was!\nGood Lord, the world as it was!\"\n\nHe had sat and then lain down on the floor.\n\n\"It's odd,\" he said, \"that though I wouldn't change that which I am,\nand that which I know, for anything that went before, I long for a\nweek, a day, an hour of the time when all the material jollinesses of\nthe world were so magically exciting. Oh, the pleasant evenings when\none didn't think, but just enjoyed what was there! There's a great\nlump of Boy still in me, which I don't get rid of. The cache: think of\nthe cache we were going to revisit in September, 1914! After all, It,\nthe mystical thing that matters, was there all the time, though one\ndidn't really know it.... But I should love to get the world as it was\nagain. I don't want it for long, I think, but just for a little while.\nRest, you know, child's play, nonsense, Italy. I would buckle to again\nafterwards, but it would be nice to be an animal again. I want not to\nthink about anything that matters, God, and my soul, and right and\nwrong....\n\n\"I want to rebel. Just for a minute. I daresay it's the devil who makes\nme want. It's a way he has. 'Be an innocent child,' says he, 'and don't\nthink. Just look at the jolly things, and the beautiful things, and\ntake your choice!' I don't want to be beastly, but I do want to get out\nof the collar of the only life which I believe to be real. I want to\neat and drink and sit in the sun, and hear the shutters bang, and read\na witty wicked book, and see a friend--you, in fact--and do again what\nwe did; I want to quench the light invisible, and make it invisible,\nreally invisible, for a minute or two. I suppose that's blasphemy all\nright.\"\n\nHe lay silent a moment, and then got up.\n\n\"Oh, do go for a walk,\" he said, \"while I prepare my posthumous packet.\nOr prepare a posthumous packet for me. You may die first, you see;\nit's easily possible that you may die first now that they're not\nsending me to the trenches again, and it would be so interesting after\nyour lamentable decease to be told by a medium what you had put in the\npacket. Let's do that. Let each of us prepare a posthumous packet,\nand seal it up, and on yours you must put directions that it is to be\ndelivered to me unopened. I needn't put anything on mine; you can keep\nthem both in a cupboard till one of us dies. And the survivor will\nconsult a medium as to what is in the late lamented's packet. Only the\nlate lamented will know. Really, it will be a great test. Come on. It\nwill be like playing caches again. Mind you put something ridiculous in\nyours.\"\n\nI procured two cardboard boxes, of which we each took one, and went to\nmy bedroom to select unlikely objects. Eventually I decided on a \"J\"\nnib, a five-franc piece and a small quantity of carbolic tooth-powder.\nThese I put in my box, put directions on the top that it was to be\ngiven on my death to Francis, and went downstairs again, where I found\nhim sealing his up. I put them both in a drawer of a table and locked\nit.\n\n\"Lord, how I long to tell you what I've put in mine!\" said Francis.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMore than half the month has passed (I am writing, as a matter of\nevidential data, on the 17th of January), and I desire to record with\nthe utmost accuracy gleanable in such affairs, the general feeling\nof the inhabitants of London with regard to the war. Briefly, then,\na huge wave of optimism--for which God be thanked--has roared over\nthe town. Peace Notes, and the replies to them, and the replies to\nthose replies have been probably the wind that raised that wave, or,\nin other words, the super-coxcomb who rules the German Empire has\nexpressed his \"holy wrath\" at the reply of our Allied nations to his\ngracious granting of peace on his own terms. But England and France\nand Russia and Italy have unanimously wondered when, in the history\nof the world, a nation that proclaimed itself victor has offered\npeace to the adversary it proclaimed it has conquered. Germany, not\nonly belligerent, but also apparently umpire, has announced that she\nhas won the war, and therefore offers peace to her victims. That was\na most astounding piece of news, and it surprised us all very much.\nBut what must have surprised Germany more was the supposedly-expiring\nsqueal of her victims which intimated that they were not conquered.\nHence the \"holy wrath\" of the World-War-Lord, who had intimated, as out\nof Sinai, that they were conquered. They don't think so--they may be\nwrong, but they just don't think so. Instead they are delighted with\nhis victorious proclamation, and take the proclamation as evidence that\nhe is not victorious. German newspapers have been, if possible, more\nchildishly profane than he, and tell us they are ready to grasp the\nhand of God Almighty, who is giving such success to their submarine\nwarfare. They said just that; it was their duty to shake hands with\nGod Almighty, because with His aid they had sunk so many defenceless\nmerchant ships. Perhaps that \"goes down\" in Germany, for it appears\nthat they are short of food, and would gladly swallow anything.\n\nBut here we are, the conquered beleaguered nation--and by a tiresome\nperversity we delight in the savage glee of our conquerors, for we\nhappen to believe that it expresses, not glee of the conqueror, but the\nsavage snarl of a fighting beast at bay. Rightly or wrongly, we think\njust that, and the louder the p\u00c3\u00a6ans from Germany, the brighter are the\neyes here. Though still the bitterness of this winter of war binds us\nwith stricture of frost, a belief in the approaching advent of spring,\nnow in mid-January, possesses everybody. Reports, the authenticity\nof which it is no longer possible to doubt, are rife concerning the\ninternal condition of Germany and Austria, which is beginning to be\nintolerable. There is not starvation, nor anything like starvation,\nbut the stress of real want grows daily, and we all believe that from\none cause or other, from this, or from the great offensive on the\nWestern front, the preparations for which, none doubts, are swiftly\nand steadily maturing, the breaking of winter is in sight. Perhaps all\nwe optimists, as has happened before, will again prove to be wrong,\nand some great crumbling or collapse may be threatening one of the\nAllies. But to-day the quality of optimism is somehow different from\nwhat it has been before. Also, the black background of war (not yet\nlifted), in front of which for the last two years and a half our lives\nhave enacted themselves, has become infinitely and intensely more\nengrossing. But here in England and France and Italy and Russia, it is\npierced with sudden gleams of sunshine; there are rifts in it through\nwhich for a moment or two shines the light of the peace that is coming.\nOnly over Germany it hangs black and unbroken.\n\nA king gave a feast to his lords and by his command there were brought\nin the spoils and the vessels which he had taken from the house of God\nwhich he had sacked and destroyed. In the same hour came forth fingers\nof a man's hand, and wrote on the wall of the king's palace. Then the\nking's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that\nthe joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one against\nanother. For he had lifted himself up against the Lord of Heaven, and\nhe knew that his doom was written. There was no need to call in the\nastrologers and soothsayers, or to search for a Daniel who should be\nable to interpret the writing, or to promise to him who should read the\nwriting and show the interpretation thereof a clothing of scarlet, a\nchain of gold, and that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom,\nfor the king's captains and his lords, and the king himself, knew what\nthe meaning and the interpretation of the writing was. In silence they\nsat as they read it, and they sat in silence looking in each other's\neyes which were bright with terror, and on each other's faces which\nwere blanched with dread. But most of all they looked at the king\nhimself, still clad in his shining armour, and the cold foam of his\ndoom was white on the lips that profaned the name of the Most Highest,\nand the hand that still grasped the hilt of the sword which to his\neternal infamy he had unscabbarded and to his everlasting dishonour had\nsoaked in innocent blood, was shaken with an ague of mortal fear. And\nthis is the writing that was written: _MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN,_\nfor God had numbered his kingdom and finished it; he was weighed in the\nbalance and found wanting; his kingdom was divided.\n\nEven so, as in the days of King Belshazzar, is the doom written of\nhim who, above all others, is responsible for the blood that has been\noutpoured on the battle-field of Europe, for the shattered limbs, the\nblinded eyes, for the murder of women and children from below on the\nhigh seas, and from above in their undefended homes. God set him on the\nthrone of his fathers, and out of his monstrous vanity, his colossal\nand inhuman ambitions, he has given over the harvest fields of the East\nto the reaper Death, and has caused blood to flow from the wine presses\nof the West. East and West he has blared out his infamous decree that\nevil is good, might is right, that murder and rape and the unspeakable\ntales of Teutonic atrocities are deeds well pleasing in the sight of\nGod. And even as in the days when, with his fool's-cap stuck on top\nof his Imperial diadem, and the jester's bells a-tinkle against his\nshining armour, he paraded through the courts of Europe and the castles\nof his dupes, as Supreme Artist, Supreme Musician, Supreme Preacher,\nas well as Supreme War Lord, and fancied himself set so high above the\ncommon race of man that no human standard could measure him; so now his\ninfamy has sunk him so low beneath the zones of human sympathy that not\ntill we can feel pity for him who first left the love-supper of His\nLord and hanged himself, we shall commiserate the doom that thickens\nround the head of the Judas who has betrayed his country and his God in\nhope to gratify his insensate dream of world-wide domination.\n\nThere still he sits at the feast with his lords and captains, but the\nwine is spilt from his cup, and his thoughts are troubled and voices\nof despair whisper to him out of the invading night. Low already burn\nthe lights in the banqueting-hall that was once so nobly ablaze with\nthe glory of those who in the sciences and the arts and in learning and\nhigh philosophy made Germany a prince among nations. He and his dupes\nand his flatterers have made a brigand and a pirate of her, have well\nand truly earned for her the scorn and the detestation of all civilized\nminds and lovers of high endeavour, and in the _D\u00c3\u00a4mmerung_ that gathers\never thicker round them the fingers of a man's hand trace on the wall\nthe letters of pale flame that need no Daniel to interpret. The painted\ntimbers of the roof are cracking, the tapestries are rent, the spilt\nwine congeals in pools of blood, and the legend of the decree of God\nblazes complete in the ruin of the shambles where they sit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is then this belief that ruin is moving swiftly and steadily up over\nthe Central Empires that causes the war once more, as in its earlier\ndays, to engross the whole of our thoughts. It is coming, as it were,\nin the traditional manner of a thunderstorm against the wind, for there\nis no use in pretending that, as far as military and naval operations\ngo, the wind is not at the moment being favourable to our enemies. By\nsea the submarine menace is more serious than it has been since the\nwar begun; there is still no advance on the West front, while on the\nEast the complete over-running of Roumania cannot be called a success\nfrom our point of view. But in spite of this, there is the rooted\nbelief that the collapse which we have so long waited for is getting\nmeasurably nearer. None knows, and few are rash enough to assert when\nit will come, or what month, near or distant, will see it, and in the\nmeantime the broom of the new Government, to judge by the dust it\nraises, may be thought to be sweeping clean, and the appalling bequests\nof our late rulers, the accumulated remains of sloppy Cabinet puddings,\nare being vigorously relegated to the dustbins. With the ineradicable\nboyishness of the nation (which really has a good deal to be said for\nit), we still tend to make a game out of serious necessities, and are\nhaving great sport over the question of food. For a few weeks we\namused ourselves over one of the most characteristic inventions of\nthe last Government, and tried to see how much we could eat without\nindulging in more than three courses for dinner or two for lunch, which\nwas what the late Food Controller allowed us. This was an amusing\ngame, but as a policy it had insuperable defects, as, for instance,\nwhen we consider that the bulk of the working population takes its\nsolid meal in the middle of the day, and would no more think of eating\nthree courses in the evening than of eating four in the morning. There\nwas a regular tariff: meat counted as one course, pudding another,\ntoasted cheese another, but you were allowed any quantity of cold\ncheese, bread and butter (those articles in which national economy was\nreally important) without counting anything at all. In the same way\nyou could have as many slices of beef as you wished (as the Government\nwanted to effect a saving in the consumption of meat), but to touch\nan apple or a pear, about which there was no desire to save, cost you\na course. Altogether it was one of the least helpful, but most comic\nschemes that could well be devised. Matilda, I fancy, thought it out\nand communicated it to Mr. Runciman by the telepathy that exists\nbetween bird-like brains. It is in flat and flagrant violation of human\npsychology, for you have only to tell the perverse race of mankind\nthat they may only eat two dishes, to ensure that they will eat much\nmore of those two dishes than was comprised in the whole of their\nunrestricted meals, while to allow them to eat as much cheese as they\nwish is simply to make cheese-eaters out of those who never dreamed of\ntouching it before. But there is a rumour now that we are to go back to\nour ordinary diet again, which I take to be true, for when this morning\nI gave Matilda a list of the regulations to show her how it looked in\nprint, she uttered a piercing yell and tore the card into a million\nfragments.\n\nBut with the new broom has come a powerful deal of cleaning up: there\nis a new Food Board, and a Man Power Board, and a fifty per cent.\nincrease in railway fares (which will be nice for the dividends of\nrailway companies), and hints of meatless days and sugar tickets, and\nthere are ideas of ploughing up the parks and planting wheat there\n(which will be nice for the wood-pigeons). Indeed, as Francis said, we\nare perhaps beginning to take the war seriously, though, on the other\nhand, since he left the prevalent optimism has largely remedied the\nabsence of the gaiety which he so much deplored.\n\n\n\n\nFEBRUARY, 1917\n\n\nGermany has proposed a toast. She drinks (_Hoch!_) to the freedom of\nthe seas. And she couples with it the freedom (of herself) to torpedo\nfrom her submarines any vessel, neutral or belligerent, at sight, and\nwithout warning.\n\nSo now at last we know what the freedom of the seas means. The seas are\nto be free in precisely the sense that Belgium is free, and Germany is\nfree to commit murder on them.\n\nThis declaration on the part of Germany was followed three days later\nby a declaration on the part of the United States. Diplomatic relations\nhave been instantly severed, and President Wilson only waits for a\n\"clear overt act\" of hostility on the part of Germany to declare war.\n\nAmerica has declared her mind with regard to the freedom of the seas,\nand that abominable toast has led to the severance of diplomatic\nrelations between her and Germany. Count Bernstorff has been dismissed,\nand in Berlin Mr. Gerard has asked for his passports. There is no\npossible shadow of doubt what that means, for we all remember August\n4th, 1914, when we refused to discuss the over-running of Belgium by\nGermany. War followed instantly and automatically. \"You shan't do\nthat,\" was the equivalent of \"If you do, we fight.\" It is precisely\nthe same position between America and Germany now. Germany _will_\ntorpedo neutrals at sight, just as Germany would overrun Belgium. The\nrest follows. Q.E.D.\n\nBut it is impossible to overstate the relief with which England has\nhailed this unmistakable word on the part of the United States. Many\npeople have said: \"What can America do if she does come in?\" But that\nwas not really the point. Of course she will do, as a matter of fact,\na tremendous lot. She will finance our Allies; she is rich, beyond all\ndreams of financiers, with the profits she has reaped from the war, and\nthe loans she will float will eclipse into shadow all that England has\nalready done in that regard. \"But what else?\" ask the sceptics. \"What\nof her army? She has no army.\" Nor for that matter had England when the\nwar began. But even the sceptics cannot deny the immense value of her\nfleet. In the matter of torpedo-boats and of light craft generally,\nwhich we so sorely need for the hunting down of those great-hearted\nchampions of the freedom of the seas, the German submarines, she can\ndouble our weapons, or, as the more enthusiastic say, she can more than\ndouble them. All the Government munition factories will be working\nlike ours, day and night; she may even bring in conscription; she will\ndevote to the cause of her Allies the million inventive brains with\nwhich she teems. This is just a little part of what America could have\ndone, when first the Belgian Treaty was torn over, and it is just a\nlittle part of what America will do now.\n\nBut all that she can do, as I said, is beside the point. The point is,\nnot what America can do, but what America _is_. Now she has shown what\nshe is, a nation which will not suffer wrong and robbery and piracy.\nThe disappointments of the past, with regard to her, are wiped off.\nShe was remote from Europe, and remote from her was the wrong done to\nBelgium.... There is no need now to recount the tale of outrages that\ndid not exhaust her patience. She waited--wisely, we are willing to\nbelieve--until she was ready, until the President knew that he had the\ncountry behind him, and until some outrage of the laws of man and of\nGod became intolerable. It has now become intolerable to her, and if\nshe is willing to clasp the hands of those who once doubted her, and\nnow see how wrong it was to doubt, a myriad of hands are here held out\nfor her grasping.\n\nThe splendour of this, its late winter sunrise, has rendered quite\ncolourless things that in time of peace would have filled the columns\nof every newspaper, and engrossed every thought of its readers. A plot,\nunequalled since the days of the Borgias, has come to light, the object\nof which was to kill the Prime Minister by means of poisoned arrows,\nor of poisoned thorns in the inside of the sole of his boot. Never\nwas there so picturesque an abomination. The poison employed was to\nbe that Indian secretion of deadly herbs called _curare,_ a prick of\nwhich produces a fatal result. A party of desperate women, opposed to\nconscription, invoked the aid of a conscripted chemist, and Borgianism,\nfull-fledged, flared to life again in the twentieth century, with a\nsetting of Downing Street and the golf-links at Walton Heath. To the\nstudent of criminology the Crippen affair should have faded like the\nbreath on a frosty morning, compared with the scheme of this staggering\nplot. But with this Western sunrise over America to occupy our public\nminds, no one (except, I suppose, the counsel in the case and the\nprisoners) gave two thoughts to this anachronistic episode. And there\nwas the Victory War Loan and National Service as well.\n\nBut though the public mind of any individual can be satiated with\nsensation, my experience is that the private mind \"carries on\" much\nthe same as usual. If the trump of the Last Judgment was to sound\nto-morrow morning, tearing us from our sleep, and summoning us out to\nHyde Park or some other open space, I verily believe that we should\nall look up at the sky that was vanishing like a burning scroll, and\nconsider the advisability of taking an umbrella, or of putting on a\ncoat. Little things do not, in times of the greatest excitement, at\nall cease to concern us; the big thing absorbs a certain part of our\nfaculties, and when it has annexed these, it cannot claim the dominion\nof little things as well. And for this reason, I suppose, I do not\nmuch attend to the Borgia plot, since my public sympathies are so\ninflamed with America; but when work is done (or shuffled somehow\naway, to be attended to to-morrow) I fly on the wings of the Tube to\nRegent's Park, and, once again, ridiculously concern myself with the\nmarks that it is possible to make on ice with a pair of skates, used\none at a time (unless you are so debased as to study grape-vines).\nThere is a club which has its quarters in that park, which in summer\nis called the Toxophilite, and in winter \"The Skating Club\" (\"The\" as\nopposed to all other skating clubs), and to the ice provided there\non the ground where in summer enthusiastic archers fit their winged\narrows to yew-wood bows, we recapture the legitimate joys of winter.\nAdmirals and Generals, individuals of private and public importance,\nall skulk up there with discreet black bags, which look as if they\nmight hold dispatches, but really hold skates, and cast off Black\nCare, and cast themselves onto the ice. An unprecedented Three Weeks\n(quite as unprecedented as those of that amorous volume) have been\nvouchsafed us, and day after day, mindful of the fickleness of frost\nin our sub-tropical climate, we have compounded with our consciences,\nwhen they reminded us that it was time to go back to work, on the plea\nthat skating was so scarce, and that in all probability the frost would\nbe gone to-morrow. To snatch a pleasure that seldom comes within reach\nalways gives a zest to the enjoyment of it, and we have snatched three\nweeks of this, under the perpetual stimulus of imagining that each day\nwould be the last. Indeed, it has been a return to the Glacial Age,\nwhen we must suppose there was skating all the year round. Probably\nthat was why there were no wars, as far as we can ascertain, in that\npacific epoch of history. Everyone was so intent on skating and\navoiding collisions with the mammoths (who must rather have spoiled the\nice) that he couldn't find enough superfluous energy to quarrel with\nhis fellows. You have to lash yourself up, and be lashed up in order to\nquarrel, and you are too busy for that when there is skating.... Was it\nto the Glacial Age that the hymn referred, which to my childish ears\nran like this:\n\n  That war shall be no more;\n  And lusto, pression, crime\n  Shall flee thy face before.\n\nI never knew, nor cared to inquire, what \"lusto\" was, nor what \"Thy\nface before\" could mean. For faces usually were before, not behind.\n\nWhile we have been enjoying these unusual rigours, Francis, \"somewhere\nin Italy,\" at a place, as far as I can gather, which not so long ago\nused to be \"somewhere in Austria,\" has not been enjoying the return\nof the Glacial Age at all. He has written, indeed, in a strain most\nunusual with him and as unlike as possible to his normal radiance\nof content. \"On the calmer sort of day,\" he says, \"the wind blows a\nhurricane, and on others two hurricanes. I can hear the wind whistling\nthrough my bones, whistling through them as it whistles through\ntelegraph wires, and the cold eats them away, as when the frost gets\ninto potatoes. Also, the work is duller than anything I have yet\ncome across in this world, and I am doing nothing that the man in a\ngold-lace cap who stands about in the hall of an hotel and expects to\nbe tipped because of his great glory, could not do quite as well as I.\nBesides, he would do it with much greater urbanity than I can scrape\ntogether, for it is hard to be urbane when you have an almost perpetual\nstomach-ache of the red-hot poker order. But in ten days now I go down\nto Rome, where I shall be for some weeks, and I shall sit in front\nof a fire or in the sun, if there is such a thing as the sun left in\nthis ill-ordered universe, and see a doctor. I dislike the thought of\nthat, because it always seems to me rather disgraceful to be ill. One\nwasn't intended to be ill.... But I daresay the doctor will tell me\nthat I'm not, and it will be quite worth while hearing that. Anyhow, I\nshall hope to get across to the beloved island for a few days, before\nI return to this tooth-chattering table-land. This is too grousy and\ngrumbly a letter to send off just as it is. Anyhow, I will keep it till\nto-morrow to see if I can't find anything more cheerful to tell you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut there was nothing added, and I must simply wait for further news\nfrom him. It is impossible not to feel rather anxious, for the whole\ntenor of his letter, from which this is but an extract, is strangely\nunlike the Francis who extracted gaiety out of Gallipoli. There is,\nhowever, this to be said, that he has practically never known pain, in\nhis serene imperturbable health, which, though I am not a Christian\nScientist, I believe is largely due to the joyful serenity of his\nspiritual health, and that probably pain is far more intolerable to him\nthan it would be to most people who have the ordinary mortal's share\nof that uncomfortable visitor. But a \"red-hot poker\" pain perpetually\nthere does not sound a reassuring account, and I confess that I wait\nfor his next letter with anxiety.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ruthless submarine campaign has begun, and there is no use in\nblinking the fact that at present it constitutes a serious menace.\nOwing to the criminal folly of the late Government, their obstinate\nrefusal to take any steps whatever with regard to the future, their\nhappy-go-lucky and imperfect provision just for the needs of the day,\nwithout any foresight as to what the future enterprise of the enemy\nmight contrive, we are, as usual, attempting to counter a blow after it\nhas been struck. Pessimism and optimism succeed each other in alternate\nwaves, and at one time we remind ourselves that there is not more\nthan six weeks' supply of food in the country, and at another compare\nthe infinitesimally small proportion of the tonnage that is sunk per\nweek with that which arrives safely at its destination. Wild rumours\nfly about (all based on the best authority) concerning the number\nof submarines which are hunting the seas, only to be met by others,\nequally well attested, which tell us how many of those will hunt the\nseas no more. There appear to be rows and rows of them in Portsmouth\nHarbour; they line the quays. And instantly you are told that at the\npresent rate of sinking going on among our merchant navy, we shall\narrive at the very last grain of corn about the middle of May. For\nmyself, I choose to believe all the optimistic reports, and turn a deaf\near, like the adder, to anything that rings with a sinister sound.\nWhatever be the truth of all these contradictory and reliable facts, it\nis quite outside my power to help or hinder, beyond making sure that\nmy household does not exceed the weekly allowance of bread and meat\nthat the Food Controller tells me is sufficient. If we are all going to\nstarve by the middle of May, well, there it is! Starvation, I fancy,\nis an uncomfortable sort of death, and I would much sooner not suffer\nit, but it is quite outside my power to avert it. Frankly, also, I do\nnot believe it in the smallest degree. Pessimistic acquaintances prove\ndown to the hilt that it will be so, and not knowing anything about the\nsubject, I am absolutely unable to find the slightest flaw in their\ndepressing conclusions. They seem to me based on sound premises, which\nare quite unshakeable, and to be logically arrived at. But if you ask\nwhether I believe in the inevitable fate that is going to overtake us,\nwhy, I do not. It simply doesn't seem in the least likely.\n\nIn addition to this development of enemy submarine warfare (for our\ndiscomfort), there have been developments on the Western front (we\nhope for theirs). The English lines have pushed forward on both\nsides of the Ancre, to find that the Germans, anticipating the great\nspring offensive, which appears to be one of the few certain things in\nthe unconjecturable unfolding of the war, have given ground without\nfighting. In consequence there has ensued a pause while our lines\nof communication have been brought up to the new front across the\ndevastated and tortured terrain which for so many months has been torn\nup by the hail of exploding shells. And for that, as for everything\nelse that happens, we find authoritative and contradictory reasons.\nSome say that the Germans could not hold it, and take this advance to\nbe the first step in the great push which is to break and shatter them;\nothers with long faces and longer tongues explain that this strategic\nretreat has checkmated our plans for the great push. But be this as it\nmay (I verily believe that I am the only person in London who has not\nbeen taken into the confidence of our Army Council), all are agreed\nthat the bell has sounded for the final round of the fight, except a\nfew prudent folk who bid us prepare at once for the spring campaign of\n1918 (though we are all going to be starved in 1917).\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe frost came to an end, and a thaw more bitter and more congealing to\nthe blood and the vital forces set in with cold and dispiriting airs\nfrom the South-East. For a week we paid in mud and darkness and fog\nfor the days of exhilarating weather, and I suppose the Toxophilites\ntook possession of the skating rink again. And then came one of those\nmiracle days, that occasionally occur in February or March, a moulted\nfeather from the breast of the bird of spring, circling high in the air\nbefore, with descending rustle of downward wings, it settled on the\nearth....\n\nI had gone down into the country for a couple of nights, arriving at\nthe house where I was to stay at the close of one of those chilly\ndim-lit February days, after a traverse of miry roads between sodden\nhedgerows off which the wind blew the drops of condensed mists that\ngathered there, and it seemed doubtful whether the moisture would\nnot be turned to icicles before morning. I had a streaming cold, and\nit seemed quite in accordance with the existing \"scheme of things\nentire\" that the motor (open of course) should break down on the steep\nascent, and demand half an hour's tinkering before it would move again.\nEventually I arrived, only to find that my hostess had gone to bed that\nafternoon with influenza, having telegraphed too late to stop me, and\nthat the two other guests were not coming till next day.\n\nNow I am no foe, on principle, to a solitary evening. There is a great\ndeal to be said for dining quite alone, with a book propped up against\nthe candlestick, a rapid repast, some small necessary task (or more\nbook) to while away an hour or two in a useful or pleasant manner, and\nthe sense of virtue which accompanies an early retirement to bed. But\nall this has to be anticipated, if not arranged, and I found a very\ndifferent programme. I dined in a stately manner, and dish after dish\n(anyone who dines alone never wants more than two things to eat) was\npresented to my notice. At the conclusion of this repast, which would\nhave been quite delicious had there only been somebody to enjoy it with\nme, or even if all sense of taste had not been utterly obliterated by\ncatarrh, I was conducted to the most palatial room that I know in any\nEnglish house, and shut in with the evening paper, a roaring fire,\nhalf a dozen of the finest Reynolds and Romneys in the world sailing\nabout and smiling on the walls, and the news that my hostess was far\nfrom well, but hoped I had everything I wanted. As a matter of fact I\nhad nothing I wanted, because I wanted somebody to talk to, though I\nhad the most sumptuous _milieu_ of things that I didn't want. Reynolds\nand Romney and a grand piano and an array of books and a box of cigars\nwere of no earthly use to me just then, because I wanted to be with\nsomething alive, and no achievement in mere material could take the\nplace of a living thing. I would humbly have asked the footman who\nbrought me my coffee-cup, or the butler who so generously filled it\nfor me to stop and talk, or play cards, or do anything they enjoyed\ndoing, if I had thought that there was the smallest chance of their\nconsenting. But I saw from their set formal faces that they would only\nhave thought me mad, and I supposed that the reputation for sanity\nshould not be thrown away unless there was something to be gained from\nthe hazard. And where was the use of going to bed at half-past nine?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe most hopeful object in the room was the fire, for it had some\nsemblance of real life about it. True, it was only a make-believe: that\nroaring energy was really no more than a destructive process. But it\nglowed and coruscated; the light of its consuming logs leaped on the\nwalls in jovial defiance of this sombre and solitary evening, it blazed\nforth a challenge against the depressing elements of wet and cold. It\nwas elemental itself, and though it was destructive, it was yet the\nsource of all life as well as its end. It warmed and comforted; to sit\nnear its genial warmth was a make-believe of basking in the sun to\nthose who had groped through an endless autumn and winter of dark days.\nThe sunshine that had made the trees put forth the branches that were\nnow burning on the hearth was stored in them, and was being released\nagain in warmth and flame. It was but bottled sunshine, so to speak,\nbut there was evidence in it that there once had been sunshine, and\nthat encouraged the hope that one day there would be sunshine again.\n\nQuite suddenly I became aware that some huge subtle change had taken\nplace. It was not that my dinner and the fire had warmed and comforted\nme, but it came from outside. Something was happening there, though it\nnever occurred to me to guess what it was. But I pushed back my chair\nfrom the imitation of summer that sparkled on the hearth, drew back\nthe curtain from the window that opened on to the terrace, and stepped\nout. And then I knew what it was, for spring had come.\n\nThe rain had ceased, the clouds that had blanketed the sky two hours\nbefore had been pushed and packed away into a low bank in the West, and\na crescent moon was swung high in the mid-heaven. And whether it was\nthat by miraculous dispensation my cold, which for days had inhibited\nthe powers of sense and taste, stood away from me for a moment, or\nwhether certain smells are perceived, not by the clumsy superficial\napparatus of material sense, but by some inward recognition, I drank\nin that odour which is among the most significant things that can be\nconveyed to the mortal sense, the smell of the damp fruitful earth\ntouched once again with the eternal spell of life. You can often\nsmell damp earth on summer mornings or after summer rain, when it is\ncoupled with the odour of green leaves or flowers, or on an autumn\nmorning, when there is infused into it the stale sharp scent of\ndecaying foliage, but only once or twice in the year, and that when\nthe first feather from the breast of spring falls to the ground, can\nyou experience that thrill of promise that speaks not of what is,\nbut of what is coming. It is just damp earth, but earth which holds\nin suspense that which makes the sap stream out to the uttermost\nfinger-tips of the trees, and burst in squibs of green. Not growth\nitself, but the potentiality of growth is there. The earth says,\n\"Behold, I make all things new!\" and the germs of life, the seeds and\nthe bulbs, and all that is waiting for spring, strain upwards and\nput forth the green spears that pierce the soil. But earth, young\neverlasting Mother Earth, must first issue her invitation; says she, \"I\nam ready,\" and lies open to the renewal of life....\n\nI hope that however long I happen to inhabit this delightful planet, I\nshall never outlive that secret call of spring. When you are young it\ncalls to you more physically, and you go out into the moonlit night,\nor out into the dark, while the rain drips on you, and somehow you\nmake yourself one with it, digging with your fingers into the earth,\nor clinging to a wet tree-bough in some blind yearning for communion\nwith the life that tingles through the world. But when you are older,\nyou do not, I hope, become in the least wiser, if by wisdom is implied\nthe loss of that exquisite knowledge of the call of spring. You have\nlearned that: it is yours, it has grown into your bones, and it is\nimpossible to experience as new what you already possess. You act the\nplay no longer; it is for you to sit and watch it, and the test of\nyour freedom from fatigued senility, your certificate to that effect,\nwill lie in the fact that you will observe with no less rapture than\nyou once enjoyed. You stand a little apart, you must watch it now,\nnot take active part in it. But you will have learned the lesson of\nspring and the lesson of life very badly if you turn your back on it.\nFor the moment you turn your back on it, or yawn in your stall when\nthat entrancing drama of unconscious youth is played in front of you,\nwhether the actors are the moon and the dripping shrubs and the smell\nof damp earth, or a boy and a girl making love in a flowery lane or in\na backyard, you declare yourself old. If the upspringing of life, the\ntremulous time, evokes no thrill in you, the best place (and probably\nthe most comfortable) for you is the grave. On the other side of the\ngrave there may be a faint possibility of your becoming young again\n(which, after all, is the only thing it is worth while being), but on\nthis side of the grave you don't seem able to manage it. God forbid\nthat on this side of the grave you should become a grizzly kitten, and\ncontinue dancing about and playing with the blind-cord long after you\nought to have learned better, but playing with the blind-cord is one of\nthe least important methods of manifesting youth....\n\nI was recalled from the terrace by decorous clinkings within, and went\nindoors to find the butler depositing a further tray of syphons and\nspirits on the table, and wishing to know at what time I wished to\nbe called. On which, taking this as a hint that before I was called,\nI certainly had to go to bed (else how could I be called?), I went\nupstairs, and letting the night of spring pour into my room, put off\ninto clear shallow tides of sleep, grounding sometimes, and once more\nbeing conscious of the night wind stirring about my room, and sliding\noff again into calm and sunlit waters. Often sleep and consciousness\nwere mixed up together; I was aware of the window curtains swaying\nin the draught while I lay in a back-water of calm, and then\nsimultaneously, so it seemed, it was not this mature and middle-aged I\nwho lay there, but myself twenty-five years ago, eager and expectant\nand flushed with the authentic call of spring. By some dim dream-like\ndouble-consciousness I could observe the young man who lay in my place;\nI knew how the young fool felt, and envied him a little, and then\nutterly ceased to envy him, just because _I had been that,_ and had\nsucked the honey out of what he felt, and had digested it and made it\nmine. It was part of me: where was the profit in asking for or wanting\nwhat I had got?\n\nThere we lay, he and I, while the night wheeled round the earth, which\nwas not sleeping, but was alert and awake. Some barrier that the past\nyears thought they had set up between us was utterly battered down by\nthose stirrings of spring, and all night I lay side by side with the\nboy that I had been. He whispered to me his surmises and his desires,\nas he conceived them in the wonder of spring nights, when he lay awake\nfor the sheer excitement of being alive and of having the world in\nfront of him. He wound himself more and more closely to me, nudging\nme with his elbow to drive into me the urgency of his schemes and\ndreams, and I recognized the reality of them. How closely he clung! How\ninsistent was his demand that I should see with his eyes, and listen\nwith his ears, and write with his hand. And, fool though he was, and\nlittle as I respected him, I could not help having a sort of tenderness\nfor him and his youth and his eagerness and his ignorance.\n\n\"I want so awfully,\" he repeated. \"Surely if I want a thing enough I\nshall get it. Isn't that so?\"\n\n\"Yes; that is usually the case,\" said I.\n\n\"Well, I want as much as I _can_ want,\" he said. \"And yet, if you are\nwhat I shall be (and I feel that is so), you haven't got it yet. Why is\nthat?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you aren't wanting enough,\" said I. \"To get it, would you\ngive up everything else, would you live, if necessary, in squalor and\nfriendlessness? Would you put up with complete failure, as the world\ncounts failure?\"\n\nHe drew a little away from me; his tense arm got slack and heavy.\n\n\"But there's no question of failure,\" he said. \"If I get it, that means\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"But it's a question of whether you will eagerly suffer anything that\ncan happen sooner than relinquish your idea. Can you cling to your\nidea, whatever happens?\"\n\nHe was silent a moment.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said.\n\n\"That means you aren't wanting enough,\" said I. \"And you don't take\ntrouble enough. You never do.\"\n\n\"I wonder! Is that why you haven't got all I want?\"\n\n\"Probably. One of the reasons, at any rate. Another is that we are\nmeant to fail. That's what we are here for. Just to go on failing, and\ngo on trying again.\"\n\n\"Oh, how awfully sad! But I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"It's true. But it's also true that you have to go on acting as if you\ndidn't believe it. You will get nothing done, if you believe it when\nyou're young.\"\n\n\"And do you believe it now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Rather not. But it's true.\"\n\nHe left me and moved away to the window.\n\n\"It's the first night of spring,\" he said. \"I must go and run through\nthe night. Why don't you come too?\"\n\n\"Because you can do it for me.\"\n\n\"Good-night then,\" he said, and jumped out of the window.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll the next morning spring vibrated in the air; the bulbs in the\ngarden-beds felt the advent of the tremulous time, and pushed up little\nerect horns of vigorous close-packed leaf, and the great downs beyond\nthe garden were already flushed with the vivid green of new growth,\nthat embroidered itself among the grey faded autumn grass. A blackbird\nfluted in the thicket, a thrush ran twinkle-footed on to the lawn,\nand round the house-eaves in the ivy sparrows pulled about straws and\ndead leaves, practising for nesting-time; and the scent, oh, the scent\nof the moist earth! In these few hours the whole aspect of the world\nwas changed, the stagnation of winter was gone, and though cold and\nfrost might come back again, life was on the move; the great tide had\nbegun to flow, that should presently flood the earth with blossom and\nbird-song. Never, even in the days when first the wand of spring was\nwaved before my enchanted eyes, have I known its spell so rapturously\nworking, nor felt a sweeter compulsion in its touch, which makes old\nmen dream dreams and middle-aged men see visions so that all for an\nhour or two open the leaves of the rose-scented manuscript again, and\nhear once more the intoxicating music, and read with renewed eyes the\nrhapsody that is recited at the opening of the high mass of youth. The\nyears may be dropping their snowflakes onto our heads, and the plough\nof time making long furrows on our faces, but never perhaps till the\nday when the silver bowl is broken, and the spirit goes to God Who gave\nit, must we fail to feel the thrill and immortal youth of the first\nhours of spring-time. And who knows whether all that this divine moment\nwakes in us here may not be but the faint echo, heard by half-awakened\nears, the dim reflection, seen in a glass darkly of the everlasting\nspring which shall dawn on us then?\n\n\n\n\nMARCH, 1917\n\n\nNever has there been a March so compounded of squalls and snows and\nunseasonable inclemencies. Verily I believe that my _Lobgesang_ of that\nspring day in February was maliciously transmitted to the powers of the\nair, and, so far from being pleased with my distinguished approval,\nthey merely said: \"Very well; we will see what else we can do, if you\nlike our arrangements so much.\" Indeed, it looks like that, for we all\nknow how the powers of Nature (the unpleasant variety of them) seem to\nconcentrate themselves on the fact of some harmless individual giving a\npicnic, or other outdoor festivity, for which sun and fine weather is\nthe indispensable basis. But now in a few days I shall defy them, for I\ndo not believe that their jurisdiction extends to Italy.\n\nItaly: yes, I said Italy, for at last an opportunity and a cause have\npresented themselves, and I am going out there \"at the end of this\nmonth, D.V.\" (as the clergyman said), \"or early in April, anyhow.\"\nRome is the first objective, and then (or I am much mistaken) there\nwill be an interval of Alatri, and then Rome again and Alatri again:\na sumptuous sandwich. How I have longed for something of the sort in\nthese two years and a half of insular northern existence I cannot hope\nto convey. Perhaps at last I have reached that point of wanting which\nensures fulfilment, but though I am interested in fantastic psychology,\nI don't really care how the fulfilment came now that it has come.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have had no word from Francis since his letter last month from the\nItalian front, announcing his departure for Rome. He mentioned that\nhe hoped to go to Alatri, and since he did not give me his address in\nRome, I telegraphed to the island, announcing my advent at the end of\nMarch or early in April. Rather to my surprise I got the following\nanswer from Alatri:\n\n        \"Was meaning to write. Come out end of March if\n        possible. Shall be here.\"\n\nFor no very clear reason this somewhat perturbed me. There was no cause\nfor perturbation, if one examined the grounds of disquietude, for if he\nwas ill he would surely have told me so before. Far the more probable\ninterpretation was that he had already forgotten about his discomforts\nand his very depressed letter, and was snatching a few rapturous days\nnow and then from Rome, and spending them on the island. He might\nforesee that he could do this again at the end of the month, and wanted\nme to come then, because he would be back at the front in April. That\nall held water, whereas the conjecture that he was ill did not. But\nthough I told myself this a good many times, I did not completely\ntrust my rendering, and his silence both before and after this telegram\nwas rather inexplicable. My reasonable self told me that there was no\nshadow of cause for anxiety, but something inside me that observed from\na more intimate spy-hole than that of reason was not quite satisfied.\nHowever, as the days of March went by and the time for my departure got\nreally within focus, this instinctive and unreasonable questioning grew\nless insistent, and finally, as if it had been a canary that annoyed\nme by its chatter, I put, so to speak, the green baize of reason quite\nover it and silenced it. Soon I shall be sitting on the pergola, where\nthe shadows of the vine-leaves dance on the paving-stones, telling\nFrancis how yet another of my famous presentiments had been added the\nlist of failures.\n\nAnd, indeed, there were plenty of other things to think about. Bellona,\ngoddess of war, has come out of her winter reverie, where, with her\nmantle round her mouth, she has lain with steadfast eyes unclosed,\nwaiting her time. All these last months she has but moved a drowsy\nhand, just sparring, but now she has sprung up and cast her mantle\nfrom her mouth, and yelled to her attendant spirits \"Wake! for winter\nis gone and spring is here!\" And, day by day, fresh news has come of\nlarger movements and the stir of greater forces. In Mesopotamia an\nadvance began late in February, and gathering volume, like an avalanche\nrushing down a snow-clad cliff, it thundered on with ever-increasing\nvelocity till one morning we heard that the Baghdad city was reached\nand fell into the hands of the British expedition. And still it rolls\non with its broad path swept clean behind it....\n\nSimultaneously the advance on the French front has continued, though\nwithout anything approaching a battle, as battles are reckoned\nnowadays. The Germans have been unable to hold their line, and\nretreating (I am sorry to say) in a masterly manner, have given us\nhundreds of square miles of territory. The ridge of Bapaume, which held\nout against the Somme offensive of last summer, has fallen into our\nhands; so, too, has Peronne. True to the highest and noblest precepts\nof _Kultur,_ the enemy in their retreat have poisoned wells, have\nsmashed up all houses and cottages with their contents, down to mirrors\nand chairs; have slashed to pieces the plants and trees in gardens, in\nvineyards and orchards; have destroyed by fire and bomb all that was\ndestructible, and have, of course, taken with them women and girls.\nThe movement has been on a very large scale, and the strategists who\nstay at home have been very busy over telling us what it all means, and\nthe \"best authority\" has been very plentifully invoked. The optimist\nhas been informed that the enemy have literally been blown out of\ntheir trenches, and tells us that a headlong retreat that will not\nstop till it reaches the Rhine has begun, while the pessimist sees\nin the movement only a strategical retreat which will shorten the\nGerman line, and enable the enemy both to send reinforcements to other\nfronts, and establish himself with ever greater security on what is\nknown as the \"Hindenburg Line.\" The retreat, in fact, according to the\npessimist (and in this the published German accounts agree with him) is\na great German success, which has rendered ineffective all the Allies'\npreparations for a spring offensive. According to the optimist, we have\ntaken, the French and we, some three hundred square miles of territory,\nsome strongly fortified German positions, at a minimum of cost. Out of\nall this welter of conflicting opinion two incontestable facts emerge,\nthe one that the enemy was unable to hold their line, the other that\ntheir retreat has cost them very little in men, and nothing at all in\nguns.\n\nIn the midst of the excitement in the West has come a prodigious\nhappening from Russia. For several days there had been rumours of\nriots and risings in Petrograd, but no authentic news came through\ntill one morning we woke to find that a revolution had taken place,\nthat the Tzar had abdicated for himself and the Tzarevitch, and that\nalready a National Government had been established, which was speedily\nrecognized by the Ambassadors of the various Powers. At one blow all\nthe pro-German party in Russia, which had for its centre the ministers\nand intriguers surrounding the Imperial Family, had been turned out by\nthe revolutionists, and the work that began with the murder of Rasputin\nat the end of December had been carried to completion. The Army and\nthe Navy had declared for the new National Government, and the work\nof the National Government after the extirpation of German influence\nwas to be the united effort of the Russian people to bring the war\nto a victorious close. The thing was done before we in the West knew\nany more than muttered rumours told us; it came to birth full-grown,\nas Athene was born from the head of Zeus. There are a thousand\ndifficulties and dangers ahead, for the entire government of a huge\npeople, involving the downfall of autocracy, cannot be changed as you\nchange a suit of clothes, but the great thing has been accomplished,\nand at the head of affairs in Russia to-day are not the Imperial\nmarionettes bobbing and gesticulating on their German wires, but those\nwho represent the people. A thousand obscure issues are involved in the\nmovement: we do not know for certain yet whether the Grand Duke Michael\nis Tzar of all the Russias, or the Grand Duke Nicholas the head of the\nRussian armies, or whether the whole family of Romanoffs have peeled\noff and thrown aside like an apple-paring; what is certain is that\nsome form of national government has taken the place of a Germanized\nautocracy. How stable that will prove itself, and whether it will be\nable to set the derelict steam-roller at work again and start it on its\nway remains to be seen. For myself, I shout with the optimists, but\ncertainly, if the crisis is over and there actually is now in power a\nfirm and national Government, capable of directing the destinies of\nthe country, it will have been the most wonderful revolution that ever\nhappened.\n\nAnd then, even earlier than I had dared to hope, for I had not expected\nto get away before the last week in March, came that blessed moment,\nwhen one night at Waterloo Station the guard's whistle sounded, and we\nslid off down the steel ribands to Southampton. In itself, to any who\nhas the least touch of the travelling or gipsy mind, to start on a long\njourney, to cross the sea, to go out of one country and into another\nwhere men think different thoughts and speak a different language, is\none of the most real and essential refreshments of life, even when he\nleaves behind him peace and entertainment and content. For two years\nand a half, if you except those little niggardly journeys that are\nscarce worth while getting into the train for, I had lived without\nonce properly moving, and, oh, the rapture of knowing that when I got\nout of this train, it was to get on to a boat, and when I got out of\nthe boat (barring the exit entailed by a mine or a submarine), it\nwould be to get into another train, and yet another train, and at the\nItalian frontier another train yet, all moving southwards. Then once\nmore there would be a boat, and after that the garden at Alatri, and\nthe stone-pine and Francis. Even had I been credibly informed by the\nangel Gabriel or some such unimpeachable authority that the chances\nwere two to one that the Southampton boat would be torpedoed, I really\nbelieve I should have gone, and taken the other chance in the hope of\ngetting safely across and, for the present, leaving England (which I\nlove) and all the friends whom I love also, firmly and irrevocably\nbehind. I wanted (as the doctors say) a change, not of climate only,\nbut of everything else that makes up life, people and things and moral\natmosphere and occupations. I was aware that there were some thousands\nof people then in London who wanted the same thing and could not get\nit, and I am afraid that that added a certain edge to ecstasy. To get\naway from the people I knew and from the nation to which I belonged\nwas the very pith of this remission. A few hours ago, too, I had been\nhunting the columns of newspapers and watching the ticking tape to\nget the very last possible pieces of information about all the events\nof which I have just given the summary, and now part and parcel of my\ndelight was to think that for many hours to come I should not see a\ntape or a newspaper. The war had been levelled at me, at point-blank\nrange; for two years and a half I had never been certain that the very\nnext moment some new report would not be fired at me (and, indeed, I\nintentionally drew such fire upon myself); but now I had got out of\nthat London newspaper office, and was flying through the dark night\nsouthwards. Here in England everything was soaked in the associations\nof war (though the most we had seen of it was two or three futile\nZeppelins), but in Alatri, which I had never known except in conditions\nof peace and serenity, its detonation and the smoke of its burning\nwould surely be but a drowsy peal of thunder, a mist on the horizon,\ninstead of that all-encompassing fog out of which leaped the flash of\nexplosions. I wanted desperately, selfishly, unpatriotically, to get\nout of it all for a bit, and Alatri, in intervals of Rome, beckoned\nlike the promised land. I am aware that a Latin poet tells us that a\nchange of climate obtained by a sea-voyage does not alter a man's mind,\nbut I felt convinced he was mistaken.\n\nThroughout that delightful journey my expectations mounted. First came\nthe windy quay at Southampton, the stealing out into the night with\nshuttered portholes, and in the early morning the arrival at Havre.\nThen for a moment I almost thought that some ghastly practical joke\nhad been played on us passengers, and that we had put back again into\na British port, so Anglicized and khakied did the town appear. But no\nsuch unseemly jest had been played, and that night I slept in Paris,\nand woke to find a chilly fog over that lucent city, which again sent\nqualms of apprehension through me, for fear that by some cantrip trick\nthis might be London again, and my fancied journey but a dream. But\nthe dream every hour proved itself real, for again I was in the train\nthat started from the Gare de Lyon, and not from my bedroom or the top\nof the Eiffel Tower, as would have been the wont of dreams, and in\ndue time there was Aix-les-Bains with its white poplars and silvery\nlake, and the long pull upwards to Modane, and the great hill-side\nthrough which the tunnel went, with wreaths of snow still large on\nits northern slopes, and when we came out of the darkness again, we\nhad passed into the \"land of lands.\" The mountain valleys were still\ngrey with winter, but it was Italy; and presently, as we sped clanking\ndownwards, the chestnut trees were in leaf, and the petroleum tins\nstood on the rails of wooden balconies with carnations already in bud,\nand on the train was a _risotto_ for lunch and a dry and abominable\npiece of veal, which, insignificant in themselves, were like some\nsignal that indicated Italy. The dry veal and the _risotto_ and the\nbudding chestnut trees and the unwearied beneficence of the sun were\nall signals of the Beloved: tokens of the presence that, after so\nlong, I was beginning to realize again. And then the great hopeless\nstation of Turin happened, where nobody can ever find the place he\nwants, and trains steal out from the platform where he has left them,\nand hide themselves again, guarded by imperious officials in cocked\nhats at subtly-concealed side tracks, escaping the notice, like prudent\nburglars, of intending travellers. There were shrill altercations\nand immediate reconcilements, and polite salutings, and finally the\nknowledge that all was well, and I found my hat and my coat precisely\nwhere I had left them, as in some conjuring trick, in the identical\ncompartment (though it and the train had moved elsewhere), and again we\nslid southwards. There were olive-trees now, green in a calm air, and\ngrey when the wind struck them, and little ruined castles stuck on the\ntops of inaccessible hills, and houses painted pink, and stone-walled\nvineyards, and dust that came in through the windows, but it was the\nbeloved Italian dust. Then came the sea again on the right-hand side\nof the train (only here was the magic of the Mediterranean), and the\nstifle of innumerable tunnels, punctuated with glimpses of Portofino,\nswimming in its hump-backed way out into the tideless sea, and the\nhuddle of roofs at Rapallo, and the bridge at Zoagli, and the empty\nsands at Sestri, and the blue-jackets crowding the platform at Spezzia.\nAll this was real; a dream, though the reality was as ecstatic as a\ndream, could not have produced those memories in their exact order and\ntheir accurate sequence, and when, next morning, I awoke somewhere\nnear Rome, I thought that the years of war-time were the nightmare,\nand this golden morning which shone on fragments of ancient aqueducts\nand knuckled fig-trees was but the resumption of what had been before\nthe unquiet night possessed and held me. Here again, as three years\nago, was the serene wash of sun and southern air, untroubled and real\nand permanent. I could open my mouth and draw in my breath. Dimly\nI remembered the fogs of the north, and almost as dimly the fact\nthat Italy was at war too, striving to put her foot on that damnable\ncentipede that had emerged from Central Europe to bite and to sting and\nto claw all that resented its wrigglings and prevented its poisoning of\nthe world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI found that after four days in Rome I was free (except for a wallet\nof papers which required attention), to go wherever I pleased for the\ninside of a week, and you may judge where next the train took me. That\nmorning I had sent to Francis news of my escape from Rome (how desirous\n\"an escape from Rome\" would have sounded a month ago), and the same\nevening, across the flames of the sunset, I saw the peaks and capes of\nthe island, shaped like a harp lying on its back, grow from dimmest\noutline of dream-shape into distinctness again. There on the left was\nthe lower horn of it, plunged into the sea; then came the inward curve,\nsloping downwards to the grey cluster of the town, where the fingers of\nthe player would be, and it swelled upwards again into the larger horn\nwhich formed the top of it. Never for more than a moment, I think, did\nmy eyes leave some part of that exquisite shape. How often in the lower\nhorn of it had Francis and I sat perched on that little platform by\nthe gilded statue of Our Lady, looking landwards across the blue plain\nof sea towards the streamer of smoke from the truncated volcano, or to\nthe coastland northwards, where the port was whitely strung like a line\nof pearls along the shore of the bay. Just below the other horn is the\ndivinest bathing-place that the world holds; on a rock a hundred yards\nfrom the shore there is a little cave, curtained by seaweed, and in it\nis a tin box where shall be found two cigarettes and matches to match.\nThose were to have been lit and smoked within two months of their\nconcealment there, and that date has now long been buried beneath the\nthree years' landslide of war. The matches will certainly be a mildewed\nfricass\u00c3\u00a9e of wood pulp and phosphorus, the cigarettes an almost more\nignoble glue of paper and tobacco; but to-morrow morning I swear that\nFrancis and I will swim there, and unearth the remains of the serene\ndays before the war, and recapture the _feel_ that there was in the\nworld before the Prussian centipede went forth on his doomed errand.\nFrancis, I know, will hate swimming so early in the year as this, for\nhe is a midsummer bather; but surely one who has been through the\nhorrors of Gallipoli and earned the V.C. in France will not absolutely\nrefuse to go through this ordeal by water for the sake of the recovery\nof the peace-cache. If it is possible to feel certain of anything, it\nis that to-morrow morning, whatever the weather, two futile Englishmen,\nas happy as they are silly, will swim out to the rock below the higher\nhorn of the harp, and verify the existence of a tin box.\n\nThe shores grew clearer, and at last through a thin low-lying haze of\nsunset we passed into the clear shadow of the island, and the houses\nand pier of the Marina on which Teresa stood to welcome the return of\nher _promesso,_ who was stricken to death as he was clasped in her\noutstretched arms, defined themselves with the engraved sharpness of\nevening in the south. As we entered this zone of liquid twilight, I\ncould see the fishing boats drawn up on the beach, the open arch of\nthe funicular station, the crowd on the quay awaiting the mild daily\nexcitement of the boat from the mainland, and at the sight of all those\nthings, unchanged and peaceful, I had for the moment more strongly\nthan ever the sense that there had been no war and there was no war,\nand that I should presently step back into the days that preceded\nthose nightmare years. In a moment now I shall be able to distinguish\na tall white-flannelled figure, who will wave his hat as he catches\nsight of me in the bow of the first disembarking boat that comes from\nthe steamer, and he will move forward to the steps, and he will say\n\"Hullo!\" and I shall say \"Hullo!\" as I step ashore to find that to-day\nis linked on without break to the summer of 1914 when I was here last.\nI may have been to Naples for a night, or did I only leave by the\nmorning boat to-day? I really do not know....\n\nAnd then I saw that Francis was not among the little group of islanders\non the quay. Probably he had not got the telegram I sent from Rome\nto-day, for the postmaster of Alatri is no friend to telegrams, and, as\nI have often thought, keeps one in his desk for a day or two, in order\nto teach you not to be in such a hurry. And when he thinks you have\nlearned your lesson, he has it delivered, two or three days afterwards,\namong your letters. But in spite of this perfectly adequate method of\naccounting for the undoubted fact that Francis had not come to meet\nthe boat, I felt an inward resurgence of the uneasiness with which I\nhad received his request that I should come out in March if possible,\nand not wait till April. I had accounted for that at the time by a\nreasonable explanation, and I could account, also reasonably, for his\nabsence. But I could now, as the funicular railway drew us up like\na bucket from the well, into the higher sunlit slopes of the island,\naccount for both by one and the same explanation. He was ill when last\nhe wrote....\n\nI found a porter in the Piazza, who shouldered my luggage, and I went\non ahead, striving to convince myself, with quite decent success, that\nI was being afraid \"even where no fear was,\" and yielded myself up,\nthough I walked briskly in order to put an end to my ominous surmises,\nto the enchantment of the hour, and of the sense that I really had\narrived again. The little huddled town, with the Piazza from the doors\nand arches of which any moment the chorus of light-opera might issue\nwith short skirts and \"catchy\" chorus, was quite unchanged, save that\nat this hour of sunset it used always to be guttural with Teutonic\ntourists, and a place to be avoided by the genuine islander. Unchanged,\ntoo, was the narrow street, where two could scarcely walk abreast,\nthat led out to the hill-side on which the villa was perched; there\nwas the narrow slit of blue overhead, and the vegetable shop and the\ntobacconist's and the _trattoria_ with the smell of spilt wine issuing\nfrom it and the lean cat blinking at the doorway. The same children\napparently ran up against one's legs, the tailor was putting up his\nshutters, and two Americans, as always, were buying picture-postcards\nat the stationer's. The path dipped downwards, ran level between olive\ngroves and villas, made a right turn and a left turn, and there above\nme was the flight of steps that led steeply up by the whitewashed\nwall of the garden, and above the wall, still catching the last rays\nof the sun, was the stone-pine, and behind it, greyish-white and\ngreen-shuttered, the house, where in a minute now Francis would welcome\nme. My bedroom shutters I saw were open, and blankets were being aired\non the window-sill, and this looked as if I was expected.\n\nI opened the garden gate, pulling at the string that lifted the latch\ninside, and a great wave of the scent of wallflower and freesias poured\nover me, warm from their day-long sunning underneath the southern wall,\nand intoxicatingly sweet. And even as I inhaled the first breath of it,\na woman came out of the dining-room door that opens on to the terrace.\nShe was dressed in the uniform of a hospital nurse.\n\n\"We were expecting you,\" she said, speaking with that precise utterance\nof foreigners. \"I hope you have had a good journey.\"\n\nThe scent of the freesias suddenly sickened me.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" I asked. \"What has happened?\"\n\n\"He wants to tell you himself,\" she said.\n\n\"He? And is it serious?\"\n\nShe looked at me with that calm, untroubled sympathy that is the reward\nof those who give up their lives to mitigate suffering.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"It is very serious. Will you go up and see him now?\"\n\n\"Surely. Where is he?\"\n\n\"In his bedroom. The third door along the passage. Ah, I forgot; of\ncourse you know.\"\n\nHe was lying much propped up in bed, opposite the open window, and as\nhe turned towards the door at my entry, I thought that this must be\nsome wicked, inexplicable joke, so radiant and young and normal was his\nface.\n\n\"Ah, that's splendid!\" he said. \"It was ripping getting your telegram\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"Francis, what's the matter?\" I asked. \"Why are you in bed? Why is\nthere a nurse here?\"\n\nHe had not let go of my hand, and now he clasped it more closely.\n\n\"I'll tell you the end first,\" he said; \"quickly; just in one word. I'm\ndying. I can't live more than a few weeks.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence, not prolonged, but at the end of it I\nfelt that I had known this for years.\n\n\"Will you hear all about it from the beginning?\" he asked. \"Or would it\nbore you?\"\n\nHe was so perfectly normal that there was really nothing left but to\nbe normal too, or it may be that a great shock stuns your emotional\nfaculties for a while. But I do not think it was that with me now.\nIt was Francis's intense serenity and happiness that infected and\nenveloped me.\n\n\"I can't tell whether it would bore me or not,\" I said, \"until I hear\nit.\"\n\n\"Then make yourself comfortable for about half an hour,\" he said. \"But\nstop me when you like.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It was very soon after I came out to Italy,\" he said, \"that I kept\ngetting attacks of the most infernal pain. Then they ceased to be\nattacks; at least, they attacked all the time. It was about then, when\nit was worst, that I wrote you a pig of a letter. Wasn't it?\"\n\n\"It was rather.\"\n\n\"Yes. I was pretty bad in other ways as well, which I'll tell you of\nafterwards. At present this is just physical. I had an awful dread all\nthe time in my mind what this might be, though I kept saying it was\nindigestion. Then I went down to Rome and saw Schiavetti, the doctor.\nAnd I can't describe to you--though it may sound odd--what a relief it\nwas to know for certain that my fears were correct. The worst I had\nfeared was true, but anyhow, the fear, the apprehension were gone. When\nyou are up against a thing, you may dislike it very much, but you don't\nfear the possibility of it any longer. It's there; and nothing, even\nthe worst, is as bad as suspense. I've got cancer.\"\n\nHe looked radiantly at me.\n\n\"That was one relief,\" he said, \"and on the top of it came another.\nIt was quite impossible to operate. I needn't be afraid of being cut\nabout. All the surgery that I have had or will have is the morphia\nneedle, which, when you are in bad pain, is neither more nor less than\nheaven. But I haven't wanted the morphia needle for the last fortnight,\nand they think I shan't want it again. After a few horrible weeks the\npain grew much less, and then ceased altogether. I doze and sleep most\nof the time now, and when I wake it is to an ecstasy. I don't want\nto die, it isn't that, and I don't want to live. But that complete\nabsence of desire isn't apathy at all. It's just the divinest content\nyou can imagine. It's true that I wanted to see you, and here you are.\"\n\nAn idea suddenly struck me.\n\n\"Then there's something happened to you,\" said I, \"which is not\nphysical.\"\n\n\"Ah! I wondered if you would think of that. Guess once more.\"\n\nIt was no question of guessing; I knew.\n\n\"You have passed through the dark night of the soul.\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"Yes; that's it. And that explains a thing you must have been asking\nyourself, why I didn't write to tell you when I knew what was the\nmatter with me. I couldn't. For among other things, which I will tell\nyou of, I had the absolute conviction that you wouldn't come, and\nwouldn't want to be bothered. That's a decent specimen of the pleasures\nof the dark night.\"\n\nHe turned a little in bed.\n\n\"But I wouldn't have been spared the dark night for all the treasures\nof heaven,\" he said. \"Out of His infinite Love Christ Jesus let me\nknow something of what He felt when He said, 'My God, my God, why\nhast Thou forsaken me?' I remember once we talked about it, and it is\nsummed up in the sense of utter darkness and utter loneliness. My mind\nreasoned it all out, and came to the absolute conclusion that there\nwas nothing: there was neither love anywhere nor God anywhere, nor\nhonour, nor decency. Had I been physically capable of it, there was\nno pleasure, carnal and devilish, that I would not have plucked at.\nAt least, I think I should, but perhaps that would not have seemed\nworth while. I didn't, anyhow, because I was in continual pain. But\nall that I believed, all the amazing happiness that I had enjoyed from\nsuch knowledge of God as I had attained to, was completely taken from\nme. I could remember it dimly, as in some nonsensical dream. My mind,\nI thought, must have been drugged into some hysterical sentimental\nmood; but now, clearly and lucidly it saw how fantastic its imagination\nhad been. I went deeper and deeper into the horror of great darkness,\nand I suppose that it was just that (namely, that my spirit knew that\nexistence without God _was_ horror) which was my means of rescue. I\nstill clung blindly and without hope to something that my whole mind\ndenied. It was precisely in the same way that I telegraphed to you to\ncome in March if you could. My mind knew for certain that you didn't\ncare, but I did that.\n\n\"It was just about then that I had forty-eight hours of the worst pain\nI had ever known. The morphia had no effect, and I lay here in a sweat\nof agony. But in the middle of it the dark night lifted off my soul\nand it was morning. I can't give you any idea of that, for it happened\nfrom outside me, just as dawn comes over the hills. And even while my\nphysical anguish was at its worst, I lay here in a content as deep as\nthat which I have now, with you sitting by me, and that delicious sense\nof physical lassitude which comes when you are resting after a hard day.\n\n\"Next day the pain began to get better, and two days afterwards it was\ngone. It has never come back since. I am glad of that, for it is quite\nbeastly. But what matters more is that the dark night is gone. And that\ncan't come back, because I know that the dawn that came to me after it\nwas the dawn of the everlasting day.\"\n\nHe paused a moment.\n\n\"And that's all,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe grew drowsy after this, and presently his nurse, a nun from a\nconvent in the mainland, settled him for the night. Seraphina came\nfrom the kitchen after I had dined, and wept a little, and told me how\nFrancis, \"_il santo signorino,_\" saw her every day, and took no less\ninterest than before in her affairs and the little everyday things.\nPasqualino was at the war, and the new boy who waited at dinner was\na fat-head, as no doubt I had noticed, and Caterina (if so be I\nremembered about Caterina and Pasqualino and the baby) was in good\nservice, and the baby throve amazingly. Provisions were dear; you\nhad to take a foolish card with you when you wanted sugar, but the\nvegetables were coming on well, and we should not do so badly. The\nSignorino liked to hear all the news, and, if God willed, he would have\nno more pain; but she wished he would eat more, and then perhaps he\nwould get his strength back, and cheat the undertaker after all. There\nwas a cousin of hers who had done just that; he was dying, they all\nsaid, and then, _Dio!_ all of a sudden he got better from the moment\nSeraphina had cooked him a great beefsteak for his dinner.\n\nTo those who have loved the lovely and the jolly things of this\nbeautiful world, the day of little things is never over, and next\nmorning, at Francis's request, I went down to the bathing-beach with\norders not to mind if the water was chilly, but swim out to the rock\nof the cache and bring the tin box home. From his window he could not\nsee the garden itself, but only the pine-tree, but would it not be\npossible to fix a looking-glass on the slant in the window-sill, so\nthat from his bed he could see as well as smell the freesias and the\nnarcissus and the wall-flowers? The success of this made him want to\nsee more, and now that the weather was warm, there surely could not be\nany harm in transplanting him, bed and all, on to the paved platform\nat the end of the pergola, and letting him spend the rest of his days\nand nights in the garden. With a few sheets of canvas, to be let down\nat night, and could we not engineer a room for him there? He often used\nto sleep out there before. The question was referred to the nurse and\nmet with her approval and that of the doctor; so that afternoon we made\neverything ready, and by tea-time had carried him out on his mattress\nwith the aid of Seraphina and the fat-head, to his great contentment.\nThis out-of-door bedroom was screened from the north by the house,\nand between the pillars of the pergola to east and south and west the\nnimble fingers of Seraphina had rigged up curtains of canvas that could\nbe drawn or withdrawn according to the weather, while overhead was the\nmatting underneath which we dined in the summer. The electric light was\nhandy to his bed, and on the table by it was a bell with which he could\nsummon the nurse, who slept in the bedroom overlooking the pergola. His\nbedside books stood there also: \"Alice in Wonderland,\" a New Testament,\n\"Emma,\" and a few more. The stone-pine whispered to the left of his\nbed, and the wind that stirred there blew in the wonderful fragrance of\nthe spring-flowering garden.\n\nFrancis had been very drowsy all day, but for an hour that evening\nwe talked exactly as we might have talked nearly three years ago,\nbefore the flame of war had scorched Europe. There were plans we had\nbeen making then for certain improvements in the house, and those we\ndiscussed anew. We spoke of the odd story concerning the footstep that\nwalked in the studio, and wondered if the _strega_ would be heard\nagain; the tin box, which I had obediently fetched from its cache,\nwas opened; Seraphina came out with commissariat suggestions for next\nday, and the news that Pasqualino had got a week's leave and would be\nhere several days before Easter to see the _bambino_ on which he had\nnever yet set eyes. Soon the stars began to appear in the darkening\nnight-blue of the sky, and the breeze from the garden bore in no longer\nthe scent of open flowers, but the veiled fragrance of their closing,\nand the smell of the damp earth, irrigated by the heavy dew, came with\nit....\n\nWe talked of pleasant and humorous little memories of the past, and\nplans for the future, just as if we were spending one of the serene\nsummer evenings the last time we were here together, three years ago,\nand it seemed perfectly natural to do so. Among those plans for the\nfuture there came up the question of my movements, and we settled that\nI should go back to Rome the day after to-morrow, and return here if\npossible for Easter.\n\n\"For that,\" said Francis cheerfully, \"will be about the end of my\ntether. The end of it, I mean, in the sense that I shan't be tethered\nany more. Oh, and there's one thing I forgot. Be sure you go to some\nmedium about the packet I sealed up on the last time I was in England.\nDon't you remember? We both sealed up a packet?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't!\" said I. \"I hate the thought of it.\"\n\n\"But you mustn't shirk,\" he said. \"If it had been you, not me, I\nshouldn't have shirked. You've got to go to some medium, and see if he\ncan tell you what's in my packet. And the interesting thing is that\nI can't remember for the life of me what I put there, and certainly\nnobody else knows. So if any medium can tell you what's inside it, it\nwill really be extremely curious. Mind you tell me--oh, I forgot.\"\n\n\"Would you mind not being quite so horrible?\" I said.\n\n\"I'm not horrible. If anybody is being horrible it's you in not feeling\nthat I shall be living, not only as much as before, but much more. I\nsay, do get hold of that.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll try. But the flesh is weak.\"\n\nHe was silent a moment.\n\n\"It's through weakness that His strength is made perfect,\" he said.\n\"And here's my nurse coming to settle me. What a jolly talk we've had!\"\n\nI got up.\n\n\"Good-night, then,\" I said.\n\n\"Good-night. Sleep as well as I shall.\"\n\nIt was still early and I went to the studio to read a little before\nI went to bed. But I found a book was not a thing one could attend\nto, and I sat doing nothing, scarcely even thinking. I did not want\nto think; all I wanted to do was to _look at_ what was going on here.\nThought, with its perplexities and conjectures and burrowings, did not\ntouch the heart of the situation. I could only contemplate; the best\nfriend I had in the world lay dying, and yet there must be no sorrow.\nHe was too utterly triumphant; banners and trumpets were assembling for\nhis passing, and he called on the joy of the world to congratulate him.\nHe was not dying, in his view, any more than a man dies who leaves a\nlittle sphere for a larger one. Death was not closing in upon him, but\nopening out for him! I saw him walking, not through a dark valley, but\nupon hill-tops at the approach of dawn, and soon for him the dim night\nworld would burst into light and colour. Already had he been through\nthe night, and now he lay there with morning in his eyes, assured of\nday. All that he waited for now was the dimming of the terrestrial\nstars, and the flooding with sun of the infinite heavens. He knew it;\nall I could decently do was to try to look at it through his eyes and\nnot through my own, which were blinded with tears that should never\nhave been shed....\n\nI did not doubt the truth of his conviction, I knew it in my bones. But\nthe flesh on my bones was weak, and it cried out for him.\n\n\n\n\nAPRIL, 1917\n\n\nIt was on the evening of the Thursday before Easter that I got back\nto Alatri. Once more the outline of the island, that had been a soft\ncloud-like shape afloat on the sea, grew distinct, and before we got\nthere it lay dark against an orange sunset and a flame of molten\nwaters. There stood the little crowd on the pier waiting the steamer's\narrival, but to-night I needed not to look for Francis among them.\nDuring the last ten days I had had frequent news from his nurse,\nalways of the same sort: he suffered no more pain, but each day he was\nsensibly weaker. But there among the crowd stood Pasqualino very smart\nin his Bersaglieri uniform; he had come down to meet me with a similar\nmessage. He had arrived two days before on a week's leave, and, so he\ntold me, spent most of the day up at the villa, helping in the house\nand weeding in the garden. Sometimes when the Signorino was awake he\ncalled to him, and they talked about all manner of things, as in the\ngood days before he was ill and before the accursed war came. \"And\nshall we all be as happy as the Signorino when we come to our last\nbed?\" asked Pasqualino.\n\nThere was a great change in Francis since ten days ago; he had drifted\nfar on the tide that was carrying him so peacefully away. He just\nrecognized me, said a few words, and then dozed off again into the\nstupor in which he had lain all day. Through the morning of Good Friday\nalso, and into the afternoon he lay unconscious. But now for the\nfirst time his sleep was troubled, and he kept stirring and muttering\nto himself, unintelligibly for the most part, though now and then\nthere came a coherent sentence. Some inner consciousness, I think,\nwas aware of what day this was, for once he said, \"It was I, my Lord,\nwho scourged Thee, and crowned Thee with the thorns of many sorrows.\"\nDuring these hours the nurse and I remained at his bedside, for his\nbreathing was difficult, and his pulse very feeble, and it was possible\nthat at any moment the end might come. Pasqualino went softly about the\ngarden barefooted, doing his weeding, and once or twice came to look at\nhis Signorino. A cat dozed in the hot sunshine, the lizards scuttled\nabout the pillars of the pergola, and in the stone-pine a linnet sang.\n\nBut about three o'clock in the afternoon his breathing grew more quiet,\nhis pulse grew stronger, and he slept an untroubled sleep for another\nhour. After that he awoke, and that evening and all Saturday morning\nhe was completely conscious and brimming over with a serene happiness.\nSometimes we talked, sometimes I read to him out of \"Emma,\" or \"Alice\nin Wonderland,\" and during the afternoon he asked me to read him the\nfew verses in St John about Easter Eve.\n\n\"Do come very early to-morrow morning,\" he said, when this was done,\n\"and read the next chapter, the Easter morning chapter.\"\n\nI put down the Bible, still open, on his table.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, \"I'll come at sunrise. But aren't you tired now?\nYou've been talking and listening all day.\"\n\n\"Yes; I'll go to sleep for a bit. And won't you go for a walk? You\nalways get disagreeable towards evening if you've had no exercise.\"\n\n\"Where shall I go?\" I asked.\n\nHe thought a moment, smiling,\n\n\"Go to the very top of Monte Gennaro,\" he said, \"to get the biggest\nview possible, and stand there and in a loud voice thank God for\neverything that there is. Say it for yourself and for me. Say 'Francis\nand I give thanks to Thee for Thy great glory.' That's about all that\nthere is to say, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I can't think of anything else.\"\n\n\"Off you go, then,\" he said. \"Oh, Lor'! I wish I was coming too. But\nI'll go to sleep instead. Good-bye.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI woke very early next morning, before sunrise, with the impression\nthat somebody had called to me from outside, and putting on a coat, I\nwent out into the garden to see whether it was Francis's voice that I\nheard. But he lay there fast asleep, and I supposed that the impression\nthat I had been called was but part of a dream. Overhead the stars were\nbeginning to burn dim in a luminous sky, and in the East the sober\ndove-colour of dawn was spreading upwards from the horizon, growing\nbrighter every moment. Very soon now the sun would rise, and as I had\npromised to come out then and read Francis the chapter in St John about\nthe Resurrection morning, it was not worth while going back to bed\nagain.\n\nSo waiting for him to awake, I took up the Bible, which still lay open\non his table where I had laid it yesterday, with \"Emma\" and \"Alice in\nWonderland,\" and as I waited I read to myself the verses that I should\npresently read aloud to him. Just as I began the first ray of the sun\novertopped the steep hill-side to the East, and shone full on the page.\nIt did not yet reach the bed where Francis lay asleep.\n\n\"And when she had thus said, she turned herself and saw Jesus standing,\nand knew not that it was Jesus.\n\n\"Jesus saith unto her, 'Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou?'\nShe, supposing him to be the gardener....\"\n\nAt that moment I looked up, for I thought I heard footsteps coming\ntowards me along the terrace, and it crossed my mind that this was\nPasqualino arriving very early to help in the house and garden, though,\nas it was Sunday, I had not expected him. But there was no one visible;\nonly at the entrance to the pergola, which was still in shadow, there\nseemed to be a faint column of light. I saw no more than that, and the\nimpression was only vague and instantaneous, and perhaps the first\nsunray on the book had dazzled me....\n\nAnd then I looked there no more, for a stir of movement from the bed\nmade me turn, and I saw Francis sitting up with his hands clasped\ntogether in front of him. And whether it was but the glory of the\nterrestrial dawn that now shone on his face or the day-spring of the\nlight invisible, so holy a splendour illuminated it that I could but\nlook in amazement on him. He was gazing with bright and eager eyes to\nthe entrance of the pergola, and in that moment I knew that he saw\nthere Him whom Mary supposed to be the gardener.\n\nThen his clasped hands quivered, and in a voice tremulous with love and\nwith exultation:\n\n\"Rabboni!\" he said, and his joyful soul went forth to meet his Lord.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNever have I felt the place so full of his dear and living presence as\nin the days that followed. It was so little of him that we laid in the\nEnglish cemetery here, no more than the discarded envelope which he\nhad done with, and the love of our comradeship seemed but to have been\nmore closely knit. Day after day, and all day long, Francis was with\nme in an intensity of actual presence that never lost its security or\nits serenity. For a week I remained there, and hourly throughout it\nI expected to see him in bodily form or to hear the actual sound of\nhis voice. But I am sure that no appearance of him, such as we call\na ghost, or any hearing of his voice, could possibly have added to\nthe reality of his companionship. What those laws are which sometimes\npermit us to be conscious with physical eye or ear of someone who\nhas passed over that stream which daily seems to me more narrow, we\ndo not certainly know; but never before did I realize how little the\nmere satisfaction of vision or audition matters, when the inward sense\nof the presence of the dead is so vivid. Nor was it I alone who felt\nthis, for Seraphina has told me how often in those days she would hear\nthe stir of a rattled door-handle or steps along the kitchen passage\nwhen she was at her cooking, and look round, expecting to see \"her\nSignorino,\" before she recollected that she would see him no more. It\nwas the same with Pasqualino, and, oddly enough, though the islanders\nare full of superstitious terror of the dead, and avoid certain places\nas haunted and uncanny, neither she nor he felt the slightest fear at\nthe thought of seeing Francis, but looked round for him with bright\neager faces which disappointment clouded again.\n\nAnd for me he was always there: in that hot blink of premature summer\nhe came down to bathe, and lay beside me on the beach; he swam with\nme to the rock of the cache; he sat with me at meals; one afternoon\nhe came up to the top of Monte Gennaro, to pick the orchises of the\nspring and to say his Gloria for himself. There was no break at all\nin our companionship; indeed, it but seemed, as I have said, to have\ngrown intenser and more vivid. And that which, when he lay dying,\nseemed quite impossible, namely, that I should come back to the island\nand the villa again now that I should not find him here, has become\nperfectly natural, since I shall most assuredly find him here. He will\nbe with me in England, too, and wherever I may go during the period\nof my mortal days, I shall find him, not by any act of faith that the\ndead die not, nor by any theoretical conviction that his individuality\nsurvives, but from the plain experience that it is so.... And when the\ndimness and the dream of life vanish from my awakening vision, I know\nalso that among the first who will give me welcome will be Francis, and\nhis grey merry eyes will greet me....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI arrived back to a cold and snowy England towards the end of the\nmonth, and as soon as I got home unlocked the drawer in which I had\nplaced on a certain day last January the two \"posthumous packets,\" as\nFrancis called them, which we had severally prepared. As the reader\nmay remember, we had packed them to serve as a test concerning the\npossibility of spirit-communication, and in mine I had placed a \"J\"\nnib, a five-franc piece and some carbolic tooth-powder, and had written\ndirections on it that it was to be sent to him to deal with in the\nevent of my dying first. While I was doing this upstairs, he was making\nready his packet in the sitting-room, and on my return gave it me\nwrapped up and bound with string and sealed. There in its drawer it had\nlain till to-day, and the time was now come when the test could be put.\nThe box in which he had disposed a certain object or objects unknown\nto me was some six inches long, and about the same across.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI at once went to a friend who is much immersed in spiritualistic\naffairs, and asked him to arrange a sitting for me with some medium\nwhom he believed to have power, and believed not to be fraudulent. (It\ndid not really matter whether the medium was fraudulent or not, since\nno amount of trickery could discover the contents of that package.) I\nasked that my name should not be given, but that a sitting should be\narranged on some appointed day. I begged him, finally, to come with\nme, so that between us we might get a fairly complete account of what\noccurred, and to be a witness. I may add that I was not at all sanguine\nas to anything occurring.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAccordingly a few days afterwards Jack Barrett arrived, and together we\ndrove off to the medium's house. The packet that Francis had made still\nlay in the locked drawer of a black oak table, and I said no word to my\nfriend either about Francis, whom he had known slightly, or about the\npacket.\n\nThe procedure was of the kind common to trance-mediums. We sat in a\nsmall front-room of a rather dingy house in a dull respectable street.\nThe room was partially darkened by the drawing of curtains over the\nwindow, but there was a bright fire burning on the hearth, and a lamp\nturned low was placed for my friend and me on a small round table, so\nthat we could see sufficiently to write without difficulty. The medium\nherself was a pleasant-looking woman, about thirty years of age, with a\nslight cockney accent and a quiet level voice. Before the sitting began\nshe made us an explanation of her powers, which I will give for what\nit is worth. Since she was a child she had often gone off into queer\ntrances, which she could induce at will. When she awoke from them, she\nnever knew more than that she had been having very vivid dreams, and\ntalking to unknown people, but all recollection of what had passed\ninstantly faded from her memory. Subsequently she married and had one\nchild, a girl, who died at the age of ten. But, going into a trance a\nday or so after her death, the mother was aware when she awoke that\nshe had been talking to her child. Thereafter she cultivated her gift,\ngetting her husband or a friend to sit with her when she was in trance,\nand listen to and take down what she said. When in trance she spoke\nin Daisy's voice, not in her own, and the dead child told her about\nits present state of existence. Daisy described other dead people whom\nshe came across, and could transmit messages from them. Such was Mrs.\nMasters's account of her gift.\n\nShe asked me only one question, and that was whether I wanted to get\ninto communication with a dead friend. I told her that this was so, and\nthen quite suddenly found myself harbouring a strong distaste for all\nthese proceedings. I should certainly have gone away and had no sitting\nat all, if I had not recollected my promise to Francis to go through\nwith it. It seemed to me like taking some sacred thing into a place of\nill-fame....\n\nAll that follows is a compilation from our joint notes, and I\nhave inserted nothing which did not appear in the notes or in the\nrecollection of both of us.\n\nThe medium sat close to me in a high chair opposite the fire, so that\nher face was clearly visible. Her eyes were closed and she had her\nhands on her lap. For about five minutes she remained thus, and then\nher breathing began sensibly to quicken; she gasped and panted, and her\nhands writhed and wrestled with each other. That passed, and she sat\nquite quiet again.\n\nPresently she began to whisper to herself, and though I strained my\nears to listen, I could catch no words. Very soon her voice grew\nlouder, but it was a perfectly different voice from that in which she\nhad spoken to us before.... It was a high childish treble, with a\nlittle lisp in it. The first coherent words were these:\n\n\"Yes, I'm here. Daisy's here. What shall I tell you about?\"\n\n\"Ask her,\" said Barrett to me.\n\n\"I want to know if you can tell me anything about a friend of mine,\" I\nsaid.\n\n\"Yes, here he comes,\" she said.\n\nShe then told us that he--whoever it was--was in the room, and was\nlooking into my face, and was rather puzzled because I did not appear\nto see him. He put his hand on my shoulder and was talking to me\nand smiling, and again seemed puzzled that I could not hear him. She\nproceeded to describe him at length with very great accuracy, and\npresently, in answer to a question, spelled out the whole of his name\nquite correctly. She told us that he had not long passed over; he had\nbeen on this side but a few weeks before, that he had died not in\nEngland, and not fighting, but he was connected with fighting. She said\nhe was talking about an island in the sea, and about bathing, and about\na garden where he had died; did I not recollect all those things?\n\nNow so far all that had been told us could easily be arrived at\nand accounted for by mind-reading. All those things were perfectly\nwell known to me, and contributed no shred of proof with regard to\nspirit-communication. For nearly an hour the medium went on in this\nmanner, telling me nothing that I did not know already, and before the\nhour was up I had begun to weary of the performance. As a whole it was\nan extraordinary good demonstration of thought-reading, but nothing\nmore at all. Indeed, I had ceased to take notes altogether, though\nBarrett's busy pencil went writing on, when quite suddenly I took my\nown up again, and attended as intently as I possibly could.\n\nFrancis told her, she said, that there was a test, and the test was in\na box, and the box was in a big black drawer. \"It's a test, he says\nit's a test,\" she repeated several times.\n\nThen she stopped, and I could hear her whispering again.\n\n\"But it's silly, it's nonsense,\" she said. \"It doesn't mean anything.\"\n\nShe laughed, and spoke again out loud.\n\n\"He says, 'Bow, wow, wow! Puss,'\" she said. \"He says, 'Gott strafe the\nV.C.' He says it's a parrot. He says it's a grey feather of a parrot\nand something else besides. Something about burning, he says. He says\nit's a cinder. It's a cinder and a parrot's feather. That's what he\nsays is the test.\"\n\nIt was not long after this that the coherent speaking ceased and\nwhisperings began again. Presently the medium said, still in the\nchild's voice, that the power was getting less. Then the voice stopped\naltogether, and soon afterwards I saw her hands twisting and wrestling\ntogether. She stretched out her arms with the air of a tired woman, and\nrubbed her eyes, and came out of trance.\n\nMy friend and I went home, and before we opened the box we compared\nand collated our notes. Then I unlocked the drawer, took out Francis's\npacket and broke the seals and cut the string. The cardboard box\ncontained a piece of paper folded round one of Matilda's grey feathers\nand a fragment of burned coal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow I see no possible way of accounting for this unless we accept Mrs.\nMasters's explanation, and believe that in some mysterious manner\nFrancis, his living self, was able to tell her while in this trance\nwhat were the contents of the packet he had sealed up. No possible\ntheory of thought-transference between her and anyone living in the\nconditions of this earthly plane will fit the case, for the simple\nreason that no one living here and now has ever had the smallest\nknowledge of what the packet contained. That information had never,\nuntil the moment that Mrs. Masters communicated it to me and my friend,\nbeen known to more than one person. Francis had made the packet,\nhad sealed it up, and in that locked drawer it had remained till we\nopened it after this sitting. I can conceive of no possible channel\nof communication except one, namely, that Francis himself spoke in\nsome mysterious way to the medium's mind. My reason and my power of\nconjecture are utterly unable to think of any other explanation.\n\nSo accepting that (for a certain reason to be touched on later, I\nrather shrink from accepting it), it follows as possible that all the\nearlier part of the sitting, which can certainly be accounted for by\nthe established phenomenon of thought-transference, may not have been\ndue to thought-transference at all, but to direct communication also\nwith Francis. And yet while the medium was speaking, telling me that he\nwas looking into my face, and wondering that I could not see him, I,\nwho have so continually with me the sense of his personal presence, had\nno such feeling. That Francis whom I knew, the same one who is now so\nconstantly with me, did not seem to be there at all ...\n\nNow I reject altogether the theory of the Roman Catholic Church,\nnamely, that when we try to communicate with the dead and apparently\nsucceed in so doing, we are not really brought into connection with\nthem, but into connection with some evil spirit who impersonates them.\nI cannot discover or invent the smallest grounds for believing that;\nit seems to me more a subject for some gruesome magazine tale than\na spiritual truth. But what does seem possible is this, that we are\nbrought into connection not with the soul of the departed, his real\nessential personality, the thing we loved, but with a piece of his mere\nmechanical intelligence. Otherwise it is hard to see why those who\nhave passed over rarely, if ever, tell us, except in the vaguest and\nmost unconvincing manner, about the conditions under which they now\nexist. They speak of being happy, of being busy, of waiting for us, but\nthey tell us nothing that the medium could not easily have invented\nherself. No _real_ news comes, nothing that can enable us to picture in\nthe faintest degree what their life over there is like. Possibly the\nconditions are incommunicable; they may find it as hard to convey them\nas it would be to convey the sense and the effect of colour to a blind\nman. Material and temporal terms must naturally have ceased to bear\nany meaning to them, since they have passed out of this infinitesimal\nsphere of space and time into the timeless and immeasurable day, the\nsun of which for ever stands at the height of an imperishable noon. If\nthey could tell us of that, perhaps we should not understand.\n\nThe upshot, then, is this: I believe that when the medium, sitting\nopposite the fire in that dim room, said what was in the sealed packet,\nthe discarnate mind of Francis told her what was there. I believe\nthe door between the two worlds not to be locked and barred; certain\npeople--such as we call mediums--have the power of turning the handle\nand for a little setting this door ajar. But what do we get when the\ndoor is set ajar? Nothing that is significant, nothing that brings us\ncloser to those on the other side. If I had not already believed in\nthe permanence and survival of individual life, I think it more than\npossible that the accurate and unerring statement of what was in the\nsealed packet might have convinced me of it. But it brought me no\nnearer Francis.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA great event has happened, for America has joined the cause of the\nAllies. That was long delayed, but there is now no possibility of\ndoubting the wisdom of such delay, if from it sprang the tremendous\nenthusiasm which shows how solid is the nation's support. What this\nevent means to the cause of the Allies cannot be over-estimated, for\nalready it is clear that Russia is as unstable as a quicksand, and none\nknows what will be swallowed up next in those shifting, unfathomable\ndepths. There is something stirring there below, and the first cries of\nliberty and unity which hailed the revolution have given place to queer\nmutterings, unconjecturable sounds....\n\nApril is nearly over, and spring, which came so late here in England\nthat long after Easter the land lay white under unseasonable snows,\nhas suddenly burst out into full choir of flower and bird-song. The\nblossoms that should have decked last month, the daffodils that should\nhave \"taken the winds of March with beauty,\" have delayed their golden\nepiphany till now, and it is as if their extra month of sleep had given\nthem a vigour and a beauty that spring never saw before. The April\nflowers are here too, and the flowers of May have precociously joined\nthem, and never was there such bustle among the birds, such hurried\ntransport of nest-building material. But through all the din of the\nforest-murmurs sounds the thud of war.\n\nHow still it was on that Easter morning....\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Up and Down, by Edward Frederic Benson\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK UP AND DOWN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 45742-8.txt or 45742-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/5\/7\/4\/45742\/\n\nProduced by Clare Graham & Marc D'Hooghe at\nhttp:\/\/www.freeliterature.org (Images generously made\navailable by the Internet Archive.)\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1040,"split":"train"}
