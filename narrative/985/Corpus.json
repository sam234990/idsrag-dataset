{"ori_id":"e32f6a88a17ae3d52fea864bde1304106f9ccce8","title":"Under the Greenwood Tree","context":"Under the Greenwood Tree\n The plot concerns the activities of a group of church musicians, the Mellstock parish choir, one of whom, Dick Dewy, becomes romantically entangled with a comely new school mistress, Fancy Day. The novel opens with the fiddlers and singers of the choir\u00e2\u0080\u0094including Dick, his father Reuben Dewy, and grandfather William Dewy\u00e2\u0080\u0094making the rounds in Mellstock village on Christmas Eve. When the little band plays at the schoolhouse, young Dick falls for Fancy at first sight. Dick, smitten, seeks to insinuate himself into her life and affections, but Fancy's beauty has gained her other suitors, including a rich farmer and the new vicar at the parish church.\nThe vicar, Mr. Maybold, informs the choir that he intends Fancy, an accomplished organ player, to replace their traditional musical accompaniment to Sunday services. The tranter and the rest of the band visit the vicar's home to negotiate, but reluctantly give way to the more modern organ. Meanwhile, Dick seems to win Fancy's heart, and she discovers an effective strategem to overcome her father's objection to the potential marriage. After the two are engaged secretly, however, vicar Maybold impetuously asks Fancy to marry him and lead a life of relative affluence; racked by guilt and temptation, she accepts. The next day, however, at a chance meeting with the as-yet-unaware Dick, surprised Maybold learns from him of his engagement to Fancy. The vicar follows by prompting her by letter, while expressing being taken aback by such news, to be honest to Dewy and withdraw her commitment to him if she indeed intended to become married to Maybold. Fancy responds by withdrawing her consent to marry Maybold and asking him to keep her initial acceptance of his proposal forever a secret. Maybold replies by urging her again to be honest with Dick and admit she accepted the vicar despite having already committed herself to the young tranter, assuring her she would be forgiven. However, as she marries Dewy who is so in love he readily dismisses what he previously (rightly) considered exhibits of her fickleness and rejoices at what he perceives at the prospect of a happy union based on honesty, given Fancy's effusive and seemingly frank admission to some (minor) infidelities, while he assumes they would never keep any secrets from each other, she resolves never to disclose the truly incontrovertible and damning evidence against her character in her having so readily accepted Maybold despite her engagement to Dewy.\nThe novel ends with a humorous portrait of Reuben, William, Mr. Day, and the rest of the Mellstock rustics as they celebrate the couple's wedding day. The mood is joyful, but at the end of the final chapter, the reader is reminded that Fancy has married with \"a secret she would never tell\" (her final flirtation and brief engagement to the vicar). While Under the Greenwood Tree is often seen as Hardy's gentlest and most pastoral novel, this final touch introduces a faint note of melancholy to the conclusion.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Under the Greenwood Tree, by Thomas Hardy\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Under the old plan, from half a dozen to\nten full-grown players, in addition to the numerous more or less grown-up\nsingers, were officially occupied with the Sunday routine, and concerned\nin trying their best to make it an artistic outcome of the combined\nmusical taste of the congregation.  With a musical executive limited, as\nit mostly is limited now, to the parson's wife or daughter and the school-\nchildren, or to the school-teacher and the children, an important union\nof interests has disappeared.\n\nThe zest of these bygone instrumentalists must have been keen and staying\nto take them, as it did, on foot every Sunday after a toilsome week,\nthrough all weathers, to the church, which often lay at a distance from\ntheir homes.  They usually received so little in payment for their\nperformances that their efforts were really a labour of love.  In the\nparish I had in my mind when writing the present tale, the gratuities\nreceived yearly by the musicians at Christmas were somewhat as follows:\nFrom the manor-house ten shillings and a supper; from the vicar ten\nshillings; from the farmers five shillings each; from each\ncottage-household one shilling; amounting altogether to not more than ten\nshillings a head annually--just enough, as an old executant told me, to\npay for their fiddle-strings, repairs, rosin, and music-paper (which they\nmostly ruled themselves).  Their music in those days was all in their own\nmanuscript, copied in the evenings after work, and their music-books were\nhome-bound.\n\nIt was customary to inscribe a few jigs, reels, horn-pipes, and ballads\nin the same book, by beginning it at the other end, the insertions being\ncontinued from front and back till sacred and secular met together in the\nmiddle, often with bizarre effect, the words of some of the songs\nexhibiting that ancient and broad humour which our grandfathers, and\npossibly grandmothers, took delight in, and is in these days unquotable.\n\nThe aforesaid fiddle-strings, rosin, and music-paper were supplied by a\npedlar, who travelled exclusively in such wares from parish to parish,\ncoming to each village about every six months.  Tales are told of the\nconsternation once caused among the church fiddlers when, on the occasion\nof their producing a new Christmas anthem, he did not come to time, owing\nto being snowed up on the downs, and the straits they were in through\nhaving to make shift with whipcord and twine for strings.  He was\ngenerally a musician himself, and sometimes a composer in a small way,\nbringing his own new tunes, and tempting each choir to adopt them for a\nconsideration.  Some of these compositions which now lie before me, with\ntheir repetitions of lines, half-lines, and half-words, their fugues and\ntheir intermediate symphonies, are good singing still, though they would\nhardly be admitted into such hymn-books as are popular in the churches of\nfashionable society at the present time.\n\nAugust 1896.\n\nUnder the Greenwood Tree was first brought out in the summer of 1872 in\ntwo volumes.  The name of the story was originally intended to be, more\nappropriately, The Mellstock Quire, and this has been appended as a sub-\ntitle since the early editions, it having been thought unadvisable to\ndisplace for it the title by which the book first became known.\n\nIn rereading the narrative after a long interval there occurs the\ninevitable reflection that the realities out of which it was spun were\nmaterial for another kind of study of this little group of church\nmusicians than is found in the chapters here penned so lightly, even so\nfarcically and flippantly at times.  But circumstances would have\nrendered any aim at a deeper, more essential, more transcendent handling\nunadvisable at the date of writing; and the exhibition of the Mellstock\nQuire in the following pages must remain the only extant one, except for\nthe few glimpses of that perished band which I have given in verse\nelsewhere.\n\nT. H.\nApril 1912.\n\n\n\n\nPART THE FIRST--WINTER\n\n\nCHAPTER I: MELLSTOCK-LANE\n\n\nTo dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree has its voice as well\nas its feature.  At the passing of the breeze the fir-trees sob and moan\nno less distinctly than they rock; the holly whistles as it battles with\nitself; the ash hisses amid its quiverings; the beech rustles while its\nflat boughs rise and fall.  And winter, which modifies the note of such\ntrees as shed their leaves, does not destroy its individuality.\n\nOn a cold and starry Christmas-eve within living memory a man was passing\nup a lane towards Mellstock Cross in the darkness of a plantation that\nwhispered thus distinctively to his intelligence.  All the evidences of\nhis nature were those afforded by the spirit of his footsteps, which\nsucceeded each other lightly and quickly, and by the liveliness of his\nvoice as he sang in a rural cadence:\n\n      \"With the rose and the lily\n         And the daffodowndilly,\n   The lads and the lasses a-sheep-shearing go.\"\n\nThe lonely lane he was following connected one of the hamlets of\nMellstock parish with Upper Mellstock and Lewgate, and to his eyes,\ncasually glancing upward, the silver and black-stemmed birches with their\ncharacteristic tufts, the pale grey boughs of beech, the dark-creviced\nelm, all appeared now as black and flat outlines upon the sky, wherein\nthe white stars twinkled so vehemently that their flickering seemed like\nthe flapping of wings.  Within the woody pass, at a level anything lower\nthan the horizon, all was dark as the grave.  The copse-wood forming the\nsides of the bower interlaced its branches so densely, even at this\nseason of the year, that the draught from the north-east flew along the\nchannel with scarcely an interruption from lateral breezes.\n\nAfter passing the plantation and reaching Mellstock Cross the white\nsurface of the lane revealed itself between the dark hedgerows like a\nribbon jagged at the edges; the irregularity being caused by temporary\naccumulations of leaves extending from the ditch on either side.\n\nThe song (many times interrupted by flitting thoughts which took the\nplace of several bars, and resumed at a point it would have reached had\nits continuity been unbroken) now received a more palpable check, in the\nshape of \"Ho-i-i-i-i-i!\" from the crossing lane to Lower Mellstock, on\nthe right of the singer who had just emerged from the trees.\n\n\"Ho-i-i-i-i-i!\" he answered, stopping and looking round, though with no\nidea of seeing anything more than imagination pictured.\n\n\"Is that thee, young Dick Dewy?\" came from the darkness.\n\n\"Ay, sure, Michael Mail.\"\n\n\"Then why not stop for fellow-craters--going to thy own father's house\ntoo, as we be, and knowen us so well?\"\n\nDick Dewy faced about and continued his tune in an under-whistle,\nimplying that the business of his mouth could not be checked at a\nmoment's notice by the placid emotion of friendship.\n\nHaving come more into the open he could now be seen rising against the\nsky, his profile appearing on the light background like the portrait of a\ngentleman in black cardboard.  It assumed the form of a low-crowned hat,\nan ordinary-shaped nose, an ordinary chin, an ordinary neck, and ordinary\nshoulders.  What he consisted of further down was invisible from lack of\nsky low enough to picture him on.\n\nShuffling, halting, irregular footsteps of various kinds were now heard\ncoming up the hill, and presently there emerged from the shade severally\nfive men of different ages and gaits, all of them working villagers of\nthe parish of Mellstock.  They, too, had lost their rotundity with the\ndaylight, and advanced against the sky in flat outlines, which suggested\nsome processional design on Greek or Etruscan pottery.  They represented\nthe chief portion of Mellstock parish choir.\n\nThe first was a bowed and bent man, who carried a fiddle under his arm,\nand walked as if engaged in studying some subject connected with the\nsurface of the road.  He was Michael Mail, the man who had hallooed to\nDick.\n\nThe next was Mr. Robert Penny, boot- and shoemaker; a little man, who,\nthough rather round-shouldered, walked as if that fact had not come to\nhis own knowledge, moving on with his back very hollow and his face fixed\non the north-east quarter of the heavens before him, so that his lower\nwaist-coat-buttons came first, and then the remainder of his figure.  His\nfeatures were invisible; yet when he occasionally looked round, two faint\nmoons of light gleamed for an instant from the precincts of his eyes,\ndenoting that he wore spectacles of a circular form.\n\nThe third was Elias Spinks, who walked perpendicularly and dramatically.\nThe fourth outline was Joseph Bowman's, who had now no distinctive\nappearance beyond that of a human being.  Finally came a weak lath-like\nform, trotting and stumbling along with one shoulder forward and his head\ninclined to the left, his arms dangling nervelessly in the wind as if\nthey were empty sleeves.  This was Thomas Leaf.\n\n\"Where be the boys?\" said Dick to this somewhat indifferently-matched\nassembly.\n\nThe eldest of the group, Michael Mail, cleared his throat from a great\ndepth.\n\n\"We told them to keep back at home for a time, thinken they wouldn't be\nwanted yet awhile; and we could choose the tuens, and so on.\"\n\n\"Father and grandfather William have expected ye a little sooner.  I have\njust been for a run round by Ewelease Stile and Hollow Hill to warm my\nfeet.\"\n\n\"To be sure father did!  To be sure 'a did expect us--to taste the little\nbarrel beyond compare that he's going to tap.\"\n\n\"'Od rabbit it all!  Never heard a word of it!\" said Mr. Penny, gleams of\ndelight appearing upon his spectacle-glasses, Dick meanwhile singing\nparenthetically--\n\n   \"The lads and the lasses a-sheep-shearing go.\"\n\n\"Neighbours, there's time enough to drink a sight of drink now afore\nbedtime?\" said Mail.\n\n\"True, true--time enough to get as drunk as lords!\" replied Bowman\ncheerfully.\n\nThis opinion being taken as convincing they all advanced between the\nvarying hedges and the trees dotting them here and there, kicking their\ntoes occasionally among the crumpled leaves.  Soon appeared glimmering\nindications of the few cottages forming the small hamlet of Upper\nMellstock for which they were bound, whilst the faint sound of church-\nbells ringing a Christmas peal could be heard floating over upon the\nbreeze from the direction of Longpuddle and Weatherbury parishes on the\nother side of the hills.  A little wicket admitted them to the garden,\nand they proceeded up the path to Dick's house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II: THE TRANTER'S\n\n\nIt was a long low cottage with a hipped roof of thatch, having dormer\nwindows breaking up into the eaves, a chimney standing in the middle of\nthe ridge and another at each end.  The window-shutters were not yet\nclosed, and the fire- and candle-light within radiated forth upon the\nthick bushes of box and laurestinus growing in clumps outside, and upon\nthe bare boughs of several codlin-trees hanging about in various\ndistorted shapes, the result of early training as espaliers combined with\ncareless climbing into their boughs in later years.  The walls of the\ndwelling were for the most part covered with creepers, though these were\nrather beaten back from the doorway--a feature which was worn and\nscratched by much passing in and out, giving it by day the appearance of\nan old keyhole.  Light streamed through the cracks and joints of\noutbuildings a little way from the cottage, a sight which nourished a\nfancy that the purpose of the erection must be rather to veil bright\nattractions than to shelter unsightly necessaries.  The noise of a beetle\nand wedges and the splintering of wood was periodically heard from this\ndirection; and at some little distance further a steady regular munching\nand the occasional scurr of a rope betokened a stable, and horses feeding\nwithin it.\n\nThe choir stamped severally on the door-stone to shake from their boots\nany fragment of earth or leaf adhering thereto, then entered the house\nand looked around to survey the condition of things.  Through the open\ndoorway of a small inner room on the right hand, of a character between\npantry and cellar, was Dick Dewy's father Reuben, by vocation a\n\"tranter,\" or irregular carrier.  He was a stout florid man about forty\nyears of age, who surveyed people up and down when first making their\nacquaintance, and generally smiled at the horizon or other distant object\nduring conversations with friends, walking about with a steady sway, and\nturning out his toes very considerably.  Being now occupied in bending\nover a hogshead, that stood in the pantry ready horsed for the process of\nbroaching, he did not take the trouble to turn or raise his eyes at the\nentry of his visitors, well knowing by their footsteps that they were the\nexpected old comrades.\n\nThe main room, on the left, was decked with bunches of holly and other\nevergreens, and from the middle of the beam bisecting the ceiling hung\nthe mistletoe, of a size out of all proportion to the room, and extending\nso low that it became necessary for a full-grown person to walk round it\nin passing, or run the risk of entangling his hair.  This apartment\ncontained Mrs. Dewy the tranter's wife, and the four remaining children,\nSusan, Jim, Bessy, and Charley, graduating uniformly though at wide\nstages from the age of sixteen to that of four years--the eldest of the\nseries being separated from Dick the firstborn by a nearly equal\ninterval.\n\nSome circumstance had apparently caused much grief to Charley just\nprevious to the entry of the choir, and he had absently taken down a\nsmall looking-glass, holding it before his face to learn how the human\ncountenance appeared when engaged in crying, which survey led him to\npause at the various points in each wail that were more than ordinarily\nstriking, for a thorough appreciation of the general effect.  Bessy was\nleaning against a chair, and glancing under the plaits about the waist of\nthe plaid frock she wore, to notice the original unfaded pattern of the\nmaterial as there preserved, her face bearing an expression of regret\nthat the brightness had passed away from the visible portions.  Mrs. Dewy\nsat in a brown settle by the side of the glowing wood fire--so glowing\nthat with a heedful compression of the lips she would now and then rise\nand put her hand upon the hams and flitches of bacon lining the chimney,\nto reassure herself that they were not being broiled instead of smoked--a\nmisfortune that had been known to happen now and then at Christmas-time.\n\n\"Hullo, my sonnies, here you be, then!\" said Reuben Dewy at length,\nstanding up and blowing forth a vehement gust of breath.  \"How the blood\ndo puff up in anybody's head, to be sure, a-stooping like that!  I was\njust going out to gate to hark for ye.\"  He then carefully began to wind\na strip of brown paper round a brass tap he held in his hand.  \"This in\nthe cask here is a drop o' the right sort\" (tapping the cask); \"'tis a\nreal drop o' cordial from the best picked apples--Sansoms, Stubbards,\nFive-corners, and such-like--you d'mind the sort, Michael?\"  (Michael\nnodded.)  \"And there's a sprinkling of they that grow down by the orchard-\nrails--streaked ones--rail apples we d'call 'em, as 'tis by the rails\nthey grow, and not knowing the right name.  The water-cider from 'em is\nas good as most people's best cider is.\"\n\n\"Ay, and of the same make too,\" said Bowman.  \"'It rained when we wrung\nit out, and the water got into it,' folk will say.  But 'tis on'y an\nexcuse.  Watered cider is too common among us.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; too common it is!\" said Spinks with an inward sigh, whilst his\neyes seemed to be looking at the case in an abstract form rather than at\nthe scene before him.  \"Such poor liquor do make a man's throat feel very\nmelancholy--and is a disgrace to the name of stimmilent.\"\n\n\"Come in, come in, and draw up to the fire; never mind your shoes,\" said\nMrs. Dewy, seeing that all except Dick had paused to wipe them upon the\ndoor-mat.  \"I am glad that you've stepped up-along at last; and, Susan,\nyou run down to Grammer Kaytes's and see if you can borrow some larger\ncandles than these fourteens.  Tommy Leaf, don't ye be afeard!  Come and\nsit here in the settle.\"\n\nThis was addressed to the young man before mentioned, consisting chiefly\nof a human skeleton and a smock-frock, who was very awkward in his\nmovements, apparently on account of having grown so very fast that before\nhe had had time to get used to his height he was higher.\n\n\"Hee--hee--ay!\" replied Leaf, letting his mouth continue to smile for\nsome time after his mind had done smiling, so that his teeth remained in\nview as the most conspicuous members of his body.\n\n\"Here, Mr. Penny,\" resumed Mrs. Dewy, \"you sit in this chair.  And how's\nyour daughter, Mrs. Brownjohn?\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose I must say pretty fair.\"  He adjusted his spectacles a\nquarter of an inch to the right.  \"But she'll be worse before she's\nbetter, 'a b'lieve.\"\n\n\"Indeed--poor soul!  And how many will that make in all, four or five?\"\n\n\"Five; they've buried three.  Yes, five; and she not much more than a\nmaid yet.  She do know the multiplication table onmistakable well.\nHowever, 'twas to be, and none can gainsay it.\"\n\nMrs. Dewy resigned Mr. Penny.  \"Wonder where your grandfather James is?\"\nshe inquired of one of the children.  \"He said he'd drop in to-night.\"\n\n\"Out in fuel-house with grandfather William,\" said Jimmy.\n\n\"Now let's see what we can do,\" was heard spoken about this time by the\ntranter in a private voice to the barrel, beside which he had again\nestablished himself, and was stooping to cut away the cork.\n\n\"Reuben, don't make such a mess o' tapping that barrel as is mostly made\nin this house,\" Mrs. Dewy cried from the fireplace.  \"I'd tap a hundred\nwithout wasting more than you do in one.  Such a squizzling and squirting\njob as 'tis in your hands!  There, he always was such a clumsy man\nindoors.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay; I know you'd tap a hundred beautiful, Ann--I know you would; two\nhundred, perhaps.  But I can't promise.  This is a' old cask, and the\nwood's rotted away about the tap-hole.  The husbird of a feller Sam\nLawson--that ever I should call'n such, now he's dead and gone, poor\nheart!--took me in completely upon the feat of buying this cask.  'Reub,'\nsays he--'a always used to call me plain Reub, poor old heart!--'Reub,'\nhe said, says he, 'that there cask, Reub, is as good as new; yes, good as\nnew.  'Tis a wine-hogshead; the best port-wine in the commonwealth have\nbeen in that there cask; and you shall have en for ten shillens,\nReub,'--'a said, says he--'he's worth twenty, ay, five-and-twenty, if\nhe's worth one; and an iron hoop or two put round en among the wood ones\nwill make en worth thirty shillens of any man's money, if--'\"\n\n\"I think I should have used the eyes that Providence gave me to use afore\nI paid any ten shillens for a jimcrack wine-barrel; a saint is sinner\nenough not to be cheated.  But 'tis like all your family was, so easy to\nbe deceived.\"\n\n\"That's as true as gospel of this member,\" said Reuben.\n\nMrs. Dewy began a smile at the answer, then altering her lips and\nrefolding them so that it was not a smile, commenced smoothing little\nBessy's hair; the tranter having meanwhile suddenly become oblivious to\nconversation, occupying himself in a deliberate cutting and arrangement\nof some more brown paper for the broaching operation.\n\n\"Ah, who can believe sellers!\" said old Michael Mail in a\ncarefully-cautious voice, by way of tiding-over this critical point of\naffairs.\n\n\"No one at all,\" said Joseph Bowman, in the tone of a man fully agreeing\nwith everybody.\n\n\"Ay,\" said Mail, in the tone of a man who did not agree with everybody as\na rule, though he did now; \"I knowed a' auctioneering feller once--a very\nfriendly feller 'a was too.  And so one hot day as I was walking down the\nfront street o' Casterbridge, jist below the King's Arms, I passed a'\nopen winder and see him inside, stuck upon his perch, a-selling off.  I\njist nodded to en in a friendly way as I passed, and went my way, and\nthought no more about it.  Well, next day, as I was oilen my boots by\nfuel-house door, if a letter didn't come wi' a bill charging me with a\nfeather-bed, bolster, and pillers, that I had bid for at Mr. Taylor's\nsale.  The slim-faced martel had knocked 'em down to me because I nodded\nto en in my friendly way; and I had to pay for 'em too.  Now, I hold that\nthat was coming it very close, Reuben?\"\n\n\"'Twas close, there's no denying,\" said the general voice.\n\n\"Too close, 'twas,\" said Reuben, in the rear of the rest.  \"And as to Sam\nLawson--poor heart! now he's dead and gone too!--I'll warrant, that if so\nbe I've spent one hour in making hoops for that barrel, I've spent fifty,\nfirst and last.  That's one of my hoops\"--touching it with his\nelbow--\"that's one of mine, and that, and that, and all these.\"\n\n\"Ah, Sam was a man,\" said Mr. Penny, contemplatively.\n\n\"Sam was!\" said Bowman.\n\n\"Especially for a drap o' drink,\" said the tranter.\n\n\"Good, but not religious-good,\" suggested Mr. Penny.\n\nThe tranter nodded.  Having at last made the tap and hole quite ready,\n\"Now then, Suze, bring a mug,\" he said.  \"Here's luck to us, my sonnies!\"\n\nThe tap went in, and the cider immediately squirted out in a horizontal\nshower over Reuben's hands, knees, and leggings, and into the eyes and\nneck of Charley, who, having temporarily put off his grief under pressure\nof more interesting proceedings, was squatting down and blinking near his\nfather.\n\n\"There 'tis again!\" said Mrs. Dewy.\n\n\"Devil take the hole, the cask, and Sam Lawson too, that good cider\nshould be wasted like this!\" exclaimed the tranter.  \"Your thumb!  Lend\nme your thumb, Michael!  Ram it in here, Michael!  I must get a bigger\ntap, my sonnies.\"\n\n\"Idd it cold inthide te hole?\" inquired Charley of Michael, as he\ncontinued in a stooping posture with his thumb in the cork-hole.\n\n\"What wonderful odds and ends that chiel has in his head to be sure!\"\nMrs. Dewy admiringly exclaimed from the distance.  \"I lay a wager that he\nthinks more about how 'tis inside that barrel than in all the other parts\nof the world put together.\"\n\nAll persons present put on a speaking countenance of admiration for the\ncleverness alluded to, in the midst of which Reuben returned.  The\noperation was then satisfactorily performed; when Michael arose and\nstretched his head to the extremest fraction of height that his body\nwould allow of, to re-straighten his back and shoulders--thrusting out\nhis arms and twisting his features to a mass of wrinkles to emphasize the\nrelief aquired.  A quart or two of the beverage was then brought to\ntable, at which all the new arrivals reseated themselves with wide-spread\nknees, their eyes meditatively seeking out any speck or knot in the board\nupon which the gaze might precipitate itself.\n\n\"Whatever is father a-biding out in fuel-house so long for?\" said the\ntranter.  \"Never such a man as father for two things--cleaving up old\ndead apple-tree wood and playing the bass-viol.  'A'd pass his life\nbetween the two, that 'a would.\"  He stepped to the door and opened it.\n\n\"Father!\"\n\n\"Ay!\" rang thinly from round the corner.\n\n\"Here's the barrel tapped, and we all a-waiting!\"\n\nA series of dull thuds, that had been heard without for some time past,\nnow ceased; and after the light of a lantern had passed the window and\nmade wheeling rays upon the ceiling inside the eldest of the Dewy family\nappeared.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III: THE ASSEMBLED QUIRE\n\n\nWilliam Dewy--otherwise grandfather William--was now about seventy; yet\nan ardent vitality still preserved a warm and roughened bloom upon his\nface, which reminded gardeners of the sunny side of a ripe\nribstone-pippin; though a narrow strip of forehead, that was protected\nfrom the weather by lying above the line of his hat-brim, seemed to\nbelong to some town man, so gentlemanly was its whiteness.  His was a\nhumorous and kindly nature, not unmixed with a frequent melancholy; and\nhe had a firm religious faith.  But to his neighbours he had no character\nin particular.  If they saw him pass by their windows when they had been\nbottling off old mead, or when they had just been called long-headed men\nwho might do anything in the world if they chose, they thought concerning\nhim, \"Ah, there's that good-hearted man--open as a child!\"  If they saw\nhim just after losing a shilling or half-a-crown, or accidentally letting\nfall a piece of crockery, they thought, \"There's that poor weak-minded\nman Dewy again!  Ah, he's never done much in the world either!\"  If he\npassed when fortune neither smiled nor frowned on them, they merely\nthought him old William Dewy.\n\n\"Ah, so's--here you be!--Ah, Michael and Joseph and John--and you too,\nLeaf! a merry Christmas all!  We shall have a rare log-wood fire\ndirectly, Reub, to reckon by the toughness of the job I had in cleaving\n'em.\"  As he spoke he threw down an armful of logs which fell in the\nchimney-corner with a rumble, and looked at them with something of the\nadmiring enmity he would have bestowed on living people who had been very\nobstinate in holding their own.  \"Come in, grandfather James.\"\n\nOld James (grandfather on the maternal side) had simply called as a\nvisitor.  He lived in a cottage by himself, and many people considered\nhim a miser; some, rather slovenly in his habits.  He now came forward\nfrom behind grandfather William, and his stooping figure formed a well-\nilluminated picture as he passed towards the fire-place.  Being by trade\na mason, he wore a long linen apron reaching almost to his toes, corduroy\nbreeches and gaiters, which, together with his boots, graduated in tints\nof whitish-brown by constant friction against lime and stone.  He also\nwore a very stiff fustian coat, having folds at the elbows and shoulders\nas unvarying in their arrangement as those in a pair of bellows: the\nridges and the projecting parts of the coat collectively exhibiting a\nshade different from that of the hollows, which were lined with small\nditch-like accumulations of stone and mortar-dust.  The extremely large\nside-pockets, sheltered beneath wide flaps, bulged out convexly whether\nempty or full; and as he was often engaged to work at buildings far\naway--his breakfasts and dinners being eaten in a strange chimney-corner,\nby a garden wall, on a heap of stones, or walking along the road--he\ncarried in these pockets a small tin canister of butter, a small canister\nof sugar, a small canister of tea, a paper of salt, and a paper of\npepper; the bread, cheese, and meat, forming the substance of his meals,\nhanging up behind him in his basket among the hammers and chisels.  If a\npasser-by looked hard at him when he was drawing forth any of these, \"My\nbuttery,\" he said, with a pinched smile.\n\n\"Better try over number seventy-eight before we start, I suppose?\" said\nWilliam, pointing to a heap of old Christmas-carol books on a side table.\n\n\"Wi' all my heart,\" said the choir generally.\n\n\"Number seventy-eight was always a teaser--always.  I can mind him ever\nsince I was growing up a hard boy-chap.\"\n\n\"But he's a good tune, and worth a mint o' practice,\" said Michael.\n\n\"He is; though I've been mad enough wi' that tune at times to seize en\nand tear en all to linnit.  Ay, he's a splendid carrel--there's no\ndenying that.\"\n\n\"The first line is well enough,\" said Mr. Spinks; \"but when you come to\n'O, thou man,' you make a mess o't.\"\n\n\"We'll have another go into en, and see what we can make of the martel.\nHalf-an-hour's hammering at en will conquer the toughness of en; I'll\nwarn it.\"\n\n\"'Od rabbit it all!\" said Mr. Penny, interrupting with a flash of his\nspectacles, and at the same time clawing at something in the depths of a\nlarge side-pocket.  \"If so be I hadn't been as scatter-brained and\nthirtingill as a chiel, I should have called at the schoolhouse wi' a\nboot as I cam up along.  Whatever is coming to me I really can't estimate\nat all!\"\n\n\"The brain has its weaknesses,\" murmured Mr. Spinks, waving his head\nominously.  Mr. Spinks was considered to be a scholar, having once kept a\nnight-school, and always spoke up to that level.\n\n\"Well, I must call with en the first thing to-morrow.  And I'll empt my\npocket o' this last too, if you don't mind, Mrs. Dewy.\"  He drew forth a\nlast, and placed it on a table at his elbow.  The eyes of three or four\nfollowed it.\n\n\"Well,\" said the shoemaker, seeming to perceive that the interest the\nobject had excited was greater than he had anticipated, and warranted the\nlast's being taken up again and exhibited; \"now, whose foot do ye suppose\nthis last was made for?  It was made for Geoffrey Day's father, over at\nYalbury Wood.  Ah, many's the pair o' boots he've had off the last!  Well,\nwhen 'a died, I used the last for Geoffrey, and have ever since, though a\nlittle doctoring was wanted to make it do.  Yes, a very queer natured\nlast it is now, 'a b'lieve,\" he continued, turning it over caressingly.\n\"Now, you notice that there\" (pointing to a lump of leather bradded to\nthe toe), \"that's a very bad bunion that he've had ever since 'a was a\nboy.  Now, this remarkable large piece\" (pointing to a patch nailed to\nthe side), \"shows a' accident he received by the tread of a horse, that\nsquashed his foot a'most to a pomace.  The horseshoe cam full-butt on\nthis point, you see.  And so I've just been over to Geoffrey's, to know\nif he wanted his bunion altered or made bigger in the new pair I'm\nmaking.\"\n\nDuring the latter part of this speech, Mr. Penny's left hand wandered\ntowards the cider-cup, as if the hand had no connection with the person\nspeaking; and bringing his sentence to an abrupt close, all but the\nextreme margin of the bootmaker's face was eclipsed by the circular brim\nof the vessel.\n\n\"However, I was going to say,\" continued Penny, putting down the cup, \"I\nought to have called at the school\"--here he went groping again in the\ndepths of his pocket--\"to leave this without fail, though I suppose the\nfirst thing to-morrow will do.\"\n\nHe now drew forth and placed upon the table a boot--small, light, and\nprettily shaped--upon the heel of which he had been operating.\n\n\"The new schoolmistress's!\"\n\n\"Ay, no less, Miss Fancy Day; as neat a little figure of fun as ever I\nsee, and just husband-high.\"\n\n\"Never Geoffrey's daughter Fancy?\" said Bowman, as all glances present\nconverged like wheel-spokes upon the boot in the centre of them.\n\n\"Yes, sure,\" resumed Mr. Penny, regarding the boot as if that alone were\nhis auditor; \"'tis she that's come here schoolmistress.  You knowed his\ndaughter was in training?\"\n\n\"Strange, isn't it, for her to be here Christmas night, Master Penny?\"\n\n\"Yes; but here she is, 'a b'lieve.\"\n\n\"I know how she comes here--so I do!\" chirruped one of the children.\n\n\"Why?\" Dick inquired, with subtle interest.\n\n\"Pa'son Maybold was afraid he couldn't manage us all to-morrow at the\ndinner, and he talked o' getting her jist to come over and help him hand\nabout the plates, and see we didn't make pigs of ourselves; and that's\nwhat she's come for!\"\n\n\"And that's the boot, then,\" continued its mender imaginatively, \"that\nshe'll walk to church in to-morrow morning.  I don't care to mend boots I\ndon't make; but there's no knowing what it may lead to, and her father\nalways comes to me.\"\n\nThere, between the cider-mug and the candle, stood this interesting\nreceptacle of the little unknown's foot; and a very pretty boot it was.  A\ncharacter, in fact--the flexible bend at the instep, the rounded\nlocalities of the small nestling toes, scratches from careless scampers\nnow forgotten--all, as repeated in the tell-tale leather, evidencing a\nnature and a bias.  Dick surveyed it with a delicate feeling that he had\nno right to do so without having first asked the owner of the foot's\npermission.\n\n\"Now, neighbours, though no common eye can see it,\" the shoemaker went\non, \"a man in the trade can see the likeness between this boot and that\nlast, although that is so deformed as hardly to recall one of God's\ncreatures, and this is one of as pretty a pair as you'd get for ten-and-\nsixpence in Casterbridge.  To you, nothing; but 'tis father's voot and\ndaughter's voot to me, as plain as houses.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt there's a likeness, Master Penny--a mild likeness--a\nfantastical likeness,\" said Spinks.  \"But I han't got imagination enough\nto see it, perhaps.\"\n\nMr. Penny adjusted his spectacles.\n\n\"Now, I'll tell ye what happened to me once on this very point.  You used\nto know Johnson the dairyman, William?\"\n\n\"Ay, sure; I did.\"\n\n\"Well, 'twasn't opposite his house, but a little lower down--by his\npaddock, in front o' Parkmaze Pool.  I was a-bearing across towards\nBloom's End, and lo and behold, there was a man just brought out o' the\nPool, dead; he had un'rayed for a dip, but not being able to pitch it\njust there had gone in flop over his head.  Men looked at en; women\nlooked at en; children looked at en; nobody knowed en.  He was covered\nwi' a sheet; but I catched sight of his voot, just showing out as they\ncarried en along.  'I don't care what name that man went by,' I said, in\nmy way, 'but he's John Woodward's brother; I can swear to the family\nvoot.'  At that very moment up comes John Woodward, weeping and teaving,\n'I've lost my brother!  I've lost my brother!'\"\n\n\"Only to think of that!\" said Mrs. Dewy.\n\n\"'Tis well enough to know this foot and that foot,\" said Mr. Spinks.\n\"'Tis long-headed, in fact, as far as feet do go.  I know little, 'tis\ntrue--I say no more; but show me a man's foot, and I'll tell you that\nman's heart.\"\n\n\"You must be a cleverer feller, then, than mankind in jineral,\" said the\ntranter.\n\n\"Well, that's nothing for me to speak of,\" returned Mr. Spinks.  \"A man\nlives and learns.  Maybe I've read a leaf or two in my time.  I don't\nwish to say anything large, mind you; but nevertheless, maybe I have.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Michael soothingly, \"and all the parish knows, that\nye've read sommat of everything a'most, and have been a great filler of\nyoung folks' brains.  Learning's a worthy thing, and ye've got it, Master\nSpinks.\"\n\n\"I make no boast, though I may have read and thought a little; and I\nknow--it may be from much perusing, but I make no boast--that by the time\na man's head is finished, 'tis almost time for him to creep underground.\nI am over forty-five.\"\n\nMr. Spinks emitted a look to signify that if his head was not finished,\nnobody's head ever could be.\n\n\"Talk of knowing people by their feet!\" said Reuben.  \"Rot me, my\nsonnies, then, if I can tell what a man is from all his members put\ntogether, oftentimes.\"\n\n\"But still, look is a good deal,\" observed grandfather William absently,\nmoving and balancing his head till the tip of grandfather James's nose\nwas exactly in a right line with William's eye and the mouth of a\nminiature cavern he was discerning in the fire.  \"By the way,\" he\ncontinued in a fresher voice, and looking up, \"that young crater, the\nschoolmis'ess, must be sung to to-night wi' the rest?  If her ear is as\nfine as her face, we shall have enough to do to be up-sides with her.\"\n\n\"What about her face?\" said young Dewy.\n\n\"Well, as to that,\" Mr. Spinks replied, \"'tis a face you can hardly\ngainsay.  A very good pink face, as far as that do go.  Still, only a\nface, when all is said and done.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Elias Spinks, say she's a pretty maid, and have done wi'\nher,\" said the tranter, again preparing to visit the cider-barrel.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV: GOING THE ROUNDS\n\n\nShortly after ten o'clock the singing-boys arrived at the tranter's\nhouse, which was invariably the place of meeting, and preparations were\nmade for the start.  The older men and musicians wore thick coats, with\nstiff perpendicular collars, and coloured handkerchiefs wound round and\nround the neck till the end came to hand, over all which they just showed\ntheir ears and noses, like people looking over a wall.  The remainder,\nstalwart ruddy men and boys, were dressed mainly in snow-white\nsmock-frocks, embroidered upon the shoulders and breasts, in ornamental\nforms of hearts, diamonds, and zigzags.  The cider-mug was emptied for\nthe ninth time, the music-books were arranged, and the pieces finally\ndecided upon.  The boys in the meantime put the old horn-lanterns in\norder, cut candles into short lengths to fit the lanterns; and, a thin\nfleece of snow having fallen since the early part of the evening, those\nwho had no leggings went to the stable and wound wisps of hay round their\nankles to keep the insidious flakes from the interior of their boots.\n\nMellstock was a parish of considerable acreage, the hamlets composing it\nlying at a much greater distance from each other than is ordinarily the\ncase.  Hence several hours were consumed in playing and singing within\nhearing of every family, even if but a single air were bestowed on each.\nThere was Lower Mellstock, the main village; half a mile from this were\nthe church and vicarage, and a few other houses, the spot being rather\nlonely now, though in past centuries it had been the most\nthickly-populated quarter of the parish.  A mile north-east lay the\nhamlet of Upper Mellstock, where the tranter lived; and at other points\nknots of cottages, besides solitary farmsteads and dairies.\n\nOld William Dewy, with the violoncello, played the bass; his grandson\nDick the treble violin; and Reuben and Michael Mail the tenor and second\nviolins respectively.  The singers consisted of four men and seven boys,\nupon whom devolved the task of carrying and attending to the lanterns,\nand holding the books open for the players.  Directly music was the\ntheme, old William ever and instinctively came to the front.\n\n\"Now mind, neighbours,\" he said, as they all went out one by one at the\ndoor, he himself holding it ajar and regarding them with a critical face\nas they passed, like a shepherd counting out his sheep.  \"You two counter-\nboys, keep your ears open to Michael's fingering, and don't ye go\nstraying into the treble part along o' Dick and his set, as ye did last\nyear; and mind this especially when we be in 'Arise, and hail.'  Billy\nChimlen, don't you sing quite so raving mad as you fain would; and, all\no' ye, whatever ye do, keep from making a great scuffle on the ground\nwhen we go in at people's gates; but go quietly, so as to strike up all\nof a sudden, like spirits.\"\n\n\"Farmer Ledlow's first?\"\n\n\"Farmer Ledlow's first; the rest as usual.\"\n\n\"And, Voss,\" said the tranter terminatively, \"you keep house here till\nabout half-past two; then heat the metheglin and cider in the warmer\nyou'll find turned up upon the copper; and bring it wi' the victuals to\nchurch-hatch, as th'st know.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nJust before the clock struck twelve they lighted the lanterns and\nstarted.  The moon, in her third quarter, had risen since the snowstorm;\nbut the dense accumulation of snow-cloud weakened her power to a faint\ntwilight, which was rather pervasive of the landscape than traceable to\nthe sky.  The breeze had gone down, and the rustle of their feet and\ntones of their speech echoed with an alert rebound from every post,\nboundary-stone, and ancient wall they passed, even where the distance of\nthe echo's origin was less than a few yards.  Beyond their own slight\nnoises nothing was to be heard, save the occasional bark of foxes in the\ndirection of Yalbury Wood, or the brush of a rabbit among the grass now\nand then, as it scampered out of their way.\n\nMost of the outlying homesteads and hamlets had been visited by about two\no'clock; they then passed across the outskirts of a wooded park toward\nthe main village, nobody being at home at the Manor.  Pursuing no\nrecognized track, great care was necessary in walking lest their faces\nshould come in contact with the low-hanging boughs of the old lime-trees,\nwhich in many spots formed dense over-growths of interlaced branches.\n\n\"Times have changed from the times they used to be,\" said Mail, regarding\nnobody can tell what interesting old panoramas with an inward eye, and\nletting his outward glance rest on the ground, because it was as\nconvenient a position as any.  \"People don't care much about us now!  I've\nbeen thinking we must be almost the last left in the county of the old\nstring players?  Barrel-organs, and the things next door to 'em that you\nblow wi' your foot, have come in terribly of late years.\"\n\n\"Ay!\" said Bowman, shaking his head; and old William, on seeing him, did\nthe same thing.\n\n\"More's the pity,\" replied another.  \"Time was--long and merry ago\nnow!--when not one of the varmits was to be heard of; but it served some\nof the quires right.  They should have stuck to strings as we did, and\nkept out clarinets, and done away with serpents.  If you'd thrive in\nmusical religion, stick to strings, says I.\"\n\n\"Strings be safe soul-lifters, as far as that do go,\" said Mr. Spinks.\n\n\"Yet there's worse things than serpents,\" said Mr. Penny.  \"Old things\npass away, 'tis true; but a serpent was a good old note: a deep rich note\nwas the serpent.\"\n\n\"Clar'nets, however, be bad at all times,\" said Michael Mail.  \"One\nChristmas--years agone now, years--I went the rounds wi' the Weatherbury\nquire.  'Twas a hard frosty night, and the keys of all the clar'nets\nfroze--ah, they did freeze!--so that 'twas like drawing a cork every time\na key was opened; and the players o' 'em had to go into a\nhedger-and-ditcher's chimley-corner, and thaw their clar'nets every now\nand then.  An icicle o' spet hung down from the end of every man's\nclar'net a span long; and as to fingers--well, there, if ye'll believe\nme, we had no fingers at all, to our knowing.\"\n\n\"I can well bring back to my mind,\" said Mr. Penny, \"what I said to poor\nJoseph Ryme (who took the treble part in Chalk-Newton Church for two-and-\nforty year) when they thought of having clar'nets there.  'Joseph,' I\nsaid, says I, 'depend upon't, if so be you have them tooting clar'nets\nyou'll spoil the whole set-out.  Clar'nets were not made for the service\nof the Lard; you can see it by looking at 'em,' I said.  And what came\no't?  Why, souls, the parson set up a barrel-organ on his own account\nwithin two years o' the time I spoke, and the old quire went to nothing.\"\n\n\"As far as look is concerned,\" said the tranter, \"I don't for my part see\nthat a fiddle is much nearer heaven than a clar'net.  'Tis further off.\nThere's always a rakish, scampish twist about a fiddle's looks that seems\nto say the Wicked One had a hand in making o'en; while angels be supposed\nto play clar'nets in heaven, or som'at like 'em, if ye may believe\npicters.\"\n\n\"Robert Penny, you was in the right,\" broke in the eldest Dewy.  \"They\nshould ha' stuck to strings.  Your brass-man is a rafting dog--well and\ngood; your reed-man is a dab at stirring ye--well and good; your drum-man\nis a rare bowel-shaker--good again.  But I don't care who hears me say\nit, nothing will spak to your heart wi' the sweetness o' the man of\nstrings!\"\n\n\"Strings for ever!\" said little Jimmy.\n\n\"Strings alone would have held their ground against all the new comers in\ncreation.\"  (\"True, true!\" said Bowman.)  \"But clarinets was death.\"\n(\"Death they was!\" said Mr. Penny.)  \"And harmonions,\" William continued\nin a louder voice, and getting excited by these signs of approval,\n\"harmonions and barrel-organs\"  (\"Ah!\" and groans from Spinks) \"be\nmiserable--what shall I call 'em?--miserable--\"\n\n\"Sinners,\" suggested Jimmy, who made large strides like the men, and did\nnot lag behind like the other little boys.\n\n\"Miserable dumbledores!\"\n\n\"Right, William, and so they be--miserable dumbledores!\" said the choir\nwith unanimity.\n\nBy this time they were crossing to a gate in the direction of the school,\nwhich, standing on a slight eminence at the junction of three ways, now\nrose in unvarying and dark flatness against the sky.  The instruments\nwere retuned, and all the band entered the school enclosure, enjoined by\nold William to keep upon the grass.\n\n\"Number seventy-eight,\" he softly gave out as they formed round in a\nsemicircle, the boys opening the lanterns to get a clearer light, and\ndirecting their rays on the books.\n\nThen passed forth into the quiet night an ancient and time-worn hymn,\nembodying a quaint Christianity in words orally transmitted from father\nto son through several generations down to the present characters, who\nsang them out right earnestly:\n\n   \"Remember Adam's fall,\n      O thou Man:\n   Remember Adam's fall\n      From Heaven to Hell.\n   Remember Adam's fall;\n   How he hath condemn'd all\n   In Hell perpetual\n      There for to dwell.\n\n   Remember God's goodnesse,\n      O thou Man:\n   Remember God's goodnesse,\n      His promise made.\n   Remember God's goodnesse;\n   He sent His Son sinlesse\n   Our ails for to redress;\n      Be not afraid!\n\n   In Bethlehem He was born,\n      O thou Man:\n   In Bethlehem He was born,\n      For mankind's sake.\n   In Bethlehem He was born,\n   Christmas-day i' the morn:\n   Our Saviour thought no scorn\n      Our faults to take.\n\n   Give thanks to God alway,\n      O thou Man:\n   Give thanks to God alway\n      With heart-most joy.\n   Give thanks to God alway\n   On this our joyful day:\n   Let all men sing and say,\n      Holy, Holy!\"\n\nHaving concluded the last note, they listened for a minute or two, but\nfound that no sound issued from the schoolhouse.\n\n\"Four breaths, and then, 'O, what unbounded goodness!' number\nfifty-nine,\" said William.\n\nThis was duly gone through, and no notice whatever seemed to be taken of\nthe performance.\n\n\"Good guide us, surely 'tisn't a' empty house, as befell us in the year\nthirty-nine and forty-three!\" said old Dewy.\n\n\"Perhaps she's jist come from some musical city, and sneers at our\ndoings?\" the tranter whispered.\n\n\"'Od rabbit her!\" said Mr. Penny, with an annihilating look at a corner\nof the school chimney, \"I don't quite stomach her, if this is it.  Your\nplain music well done is as worthy as your other sort done bad, a'\nb'lieve, souls; so say I.\"\n\n\"Four breaths, and then the last,\" said the leader authoritatively.\n\"'Rejoice, ye Tenants of the Earth,' number sixty-four.\"\n\nAt the close, waiting yet another minute, he said in a clear loud voice,\nas he had said in the village at that hour and season for the previous\nforty years--\"A merry Christmas to ye!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V: THE LISTENERS\n\n\nWhen the expectant stillness consequent upon the exclamation had nearly\ndied out of them all, an increasing light made itself visible in one of\nthe windows of the upper floor.  It came so close to the blind that the\nexact position of the flame could be perceived from the outside.\nRemaining steady for an instant, the blind went upward from before it,\nrevealing to thirty concentrated eyes a young girl, framed as a picture\nby the window architrave, and unconsciously illuminating her countenance\nto a vivid brightness by a candle she held in her left hand, close to her\nface, her right hand being extended to the side of the window.  She was\nwrapped in a white robe of some kind, whilst down her shoulders fell a\ntwining profusion of marvellously rich hair, in a wild disorder which\nproclaimed it to be only during the invisible hours of the night that\nsuch a condition was discoverable.  Her bright eyes were looking into the\ngrey world outside with an uncertain expression, oscillating between\ncourage and shyness, which, as she recognized the semicircular group of\ndark forms gathered before her, transformed itself into pleasant\nresolution.\n\nOpening the window, she said lightly and warmly--\"Thank you, singers,\nthank you!\"\n\nTogether went the window quickly and quietly, and the blind started\ndownward on its return to its place.  Her fair forehead and eyes\nvanished; her little mouth; her neck and shoulders; all of her.  Then the\nspot of candlelight shone nebulously as before; then it moved away.\n\n\"How pretty!\" exclaimed Dick Dewy.\n\n\"If she'd been rale wexwork she couldn't ha' been comelier,\" said Michael\nMail.\n\n\"As near a thing to a spiritual vision as ever I wish to see!\" said\ntranter Dewy.\n\n\"O, sich I never, never see!\" said Leaf fervently.\n\nAll the rest, after clearing their throats and adjusting their hats,\nagreed that such a sight was worth singing for.\n\n\"Now to Farmer Shiner's, and then replenish our insides, father?\" said\nthe tranter.\n\n\"Wi' all my heart,\" said old William, shouldering his bass-viol.\n\nFarmer Shiner's was a queer lump of a house, standing at the corner of a\nlane that ran into the principal thoroughfare.  The upper windows were\nmuch wider than they were high, and this feature, together with a broad\nbay-window where the door might have been expected, gave it by day the\naspect of a human countenance turned askance, and wearing a sly and\nwicked leer.  To-night nothing was visible but the outline of the roof\nupon the sky.\n\nThe front of this building was reached, and the preliminaries arranged as\nusual.\n\n\"Four breaths, and number thirty-two, 'Behold the Morning Star,'\" said\nold William.\n\nThey had reached the end of the second verse, and the fiddlers were doing\nthe up bow-stroke previously to pouring forth the opening chord of the\nthird verse, when, without a light appearing or any signal being given, a\nroaring voice exclaimed--\n\n\"Shut up, woll 'ee!  Don't make your blaring row here!  A feller wi' a\nheadache enough to split his skull likes a quiet night!\"\n\nSlam went the window.\n\n\"Hullo, that's a' ugly blow for we!\" said the tranter, in a keenly\nappreciative voice, and turning to his companions.\n\n\"Finish the carrel, all who be friends of harmony!\" commanded old\nWilliam; and they continued to the end.\n\n\"Four breaths, and number nineteen!\" said William firmly.  \"Give it him\nwell; the quire can't be insulted in this manner!\"\n\nA light now flashed into existence, the window opened, and the farmer\nstood revealed as one in a terrific passion.\n\n\"Drown en!--drown en!\" the tranter cried, fiddling frantically.  \"Play\nfortissimy, and drown his spaking!\"\n\n\"Fortissimy!\" said Michael Mail, and the music and singing waxed so loud\nthat it was impossible to know what Mr. Shiner had said, was saying, or\nwas about to say; but wildly flinging his arms and body about in the\nforms of capital Xs and Ys, he appeared to utter enough invectives to\nconsign the whole parish to perdition.\n\n\"Very onseemly--very!\" said old William, as they retired.  \"Never such a\ndreadful scene in the whole round o' my carrel practice--never!  And he a\nchurchwarden!\"\n\n\"Only a drap o' drink got into his head,\" said the tranter.  \"Man's well\nenough when he's in his religious frame.  He's in his worldly frame now.\nMust ask en to our bit of a party to-morrow night, I suppose, and so put\nen in humour again.  We bear no mortal man ill-will.\"\n\nThey now crossed Mellstock Bridge, and went along an embowered path\nbeside the Froom towards the church and vicarage, meeting Voss with the\nhot mead and bread-and-cheese as they were approaching the churchyard.\nThis determined them to eat and drink before proceeding further, and they\nentered the church and ascended to the gallery.  The lanterns were\nopened, and the whole body sat round against the walls on benches and\nwhatever else was available, and made a hearty meal.  In the pauses of\nconversation there could be heard through the floor overhead a little\nworld of undertones and creaks from the halting clockwork, which never\nspread further than the tower they were born in, and raised in the more\nmeditative minds a fancy that here lay the direct pathway of Time.\n\nHaving done eating and drinking, they again tuned the instruments, and\nonce more the party emerged into the night air.\n\n\"Where's Dick?\" said old Dewy.\n\nEvery man looked round upon every other man, as if Dick might have been\ntransmuted into one or the other; and then they said they didn't know.\n\n\"Well now, that's what I call very nasty of Master Dicky, that I do,\"\nsaid Michael Mail.\n\n\"He've clinked off home-along, depend upon't,\" another suggested, though\nnot quite believing that he had.\n\n\"Dick!\" exclaimed the tranter, and his voice rolled sonorously forth\namong the yews.\n\nHe suspended his muscles rigid as stone whilst listening for an answer,\nand finding he listened in vain, turned to the assemblage.\n\n\"The treble man too!  Now if he'd been a tenor or counter chap, we might\nha' contrived the rest o't without en, you see.  But for a quire to lose\nthe treble, why, my sonnies, you may so well lose your . . . \"  The\ntranter paused, unable to mention an image vast enough for the occasion.\n\n\"Your head at once,\" suggested Mr. Penny.\n\nThe tranter moved a pace, as if it were puerile of people to complete\nsentences when there were more pressing things to be done.\n\n\"Was ever heard such a thing as a young man leaving his work half done\nand turning tail like this!\"\n\n\"Never,\" replied Bowman, in a tone signifying that he was the last man in\nthe world to wish to withhold the formal finish required of him.\n\n\"I hope no fatal tragedy has overtook the lad!\" said his grandfather.\n\n\"O no,\" replied tranter Dewy placidly.  \"Wonder where he's put that there\nfiddle of his.  Why that fiddle cost thirty shillings, and good words\nbesides.  Somewhere in the damp, without doubt; that instrument will be\nunglued and spoilt in ten minutes--ten! ay, two.\"\n\n\"What in the name o' righteousness can have happened?\" said old William,\nmore uneasily.  \"Perhaps he's drownded!\"\n\nLeaving their lanterns and instruments in the belfry they retraced their\nsteps along the waterside track.  \"A strapping lad like Dick d'know\nbetter than let anything happen onawares,\" Reuben remarked.  \"There's\nsure to be some poor little scram reason for't staring us in the face all\nthe while.\"  He lowered his voice to a mysterious tone: \"Neighbours, have\nye noticed any sign of a scornful woman in his head, or suchlike?\"\n\n\"Not a glimmer of such a body.  He's as clear as water yet.\"\n\n\"And Dicky said he should never marry,\" cried Jimmy, \"but live at home\nalways along wi' mother and we!\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, my sonny; every lad has said that in his time.\"\n\nThey had now again reached the precincts of Mr. Shiner's, but hearing\nnobody in that direction, one or two went across to the schoolhouse.  A\nlight was still burning in the bedroom, and though the blind was down,\nthe window had been slightly opened, as if to admit the distant notes of\nthe carollers to the ears of the occupant of the room.\n\nOpposite the window, leaning motionless against a beech tree, was the\nlost man, his arms folded, his head thrown back, his eyes fixed upon the\nilluminated lattice.\n\n\"Why, Dick, is that thee?  What b'st doing here?\"\n\nDick's body instantly flew into a more rational attitude, and his head\nwas seen to turn east and west in the gloom, as if endeavouring to\ndiscern some proper answer to that question; and at last he said in\nrather feeble accents--\"Nothing, father.\"\n\n\"Th'st take long enough time about it then, upon my body,\" said the\ntranter, as they all turned anew towards the vicarage.\n\n\"I thought you hadn't done having snap in the gallery,\" said Dick.\n\n\"Why, we've been traypsing and rambling about, looking everywhere, and\nthinking you'd done fifty deathly things, and here have you been at\nnothing at all!\"\n\n\"The stupidness lies in that point of it being nothing at all,\" murmured\nMr. Spinks.\n\nThe vicarage front was their next field of operation, and Mr. Maybold,\nthe lately-arrived incumbent, duly received his share of the night's\nharmonies.  It was hoped that by reason of his profession he would have\nbeen led to open the window, and an extra carol in quick time was added\nto draw him forth.  But Mr. Maybold made no stir.\n\n\"A bad sign!\" said old William, shaking his head.\n\nHowever, at that same instant a musical voice was heard exclaiming from\ninner depths of bedclothes--\"Thanks, villagers!\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked Bowman, who was rather dull of hearing.  Bowman's\nvoice, being therefore loud, had been heard by the vicar within.\n\n\"I said, 'Thanks, villagers!'\" cried the vicar again.\n\n\"Oh, we didn't hear 'ee the first time!\" cried Bowman.\n\n\"Now don't for heaven's sake spoil the young man's temper by answering\nlike that!\" said the tranter.\n\n\"You won't do that, my friends!\" the vicar shouted.\n\n\"Well to be sure, what ears!\" said Mr. Penny in a whisper.  \"Beats any\nhorse or dog in the parish, and depend upon't, that's a sign he's a\nproper clever chap.\"\n\n\"We shall see that in time,\" said the tranter.\n\nOld William, in his gratitude for such thanks from a comparatively new\ninhabitant, was anxious to play all the tunes over again; but renounced\nhis desire on being reminded by Reuben that it would be best to leave\nwell alone.\n\n\"Now putting two and two together,\" the tranter continued, as they went\ntheir way over the hill, and across to the last remaining houses; \"that\nis, in the form of that young female vision we zeed just now, and this\nyoung tenor-voiced parson, my belief is she'll wind en round her finger,\nand twist the pore young feller about like the figure of 8--that she will\nso, my sonnies.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI: CHRISTMAS MORNING\n\n\nThe choir at last reached their beds, and slept like the rest of the\nparish.  Dick's slumbers, through the three or four hours remaining for\nrest, were disturbed and slight; an exhaustive variation upon the\nincidents that had passed that night in connection with the school-window\ngoing on in his brain every moment of the time.\n\nIn the morning, do what he would--go upstairs, downstairs, out of doors,\nspeak of the wind and weather, or what not--he could not refrain from an\nunceasing renewal, in imagination, of that interesting enactment.  Tilted\non the edge of one foot he stood beside the fireplace, watching his\nmother grilling rashers; but there was nothing in grilling, he thought,\nunless the Vision grilled.  The limp rasher hung down between the bars of\nthe gridiron like a cat in a child's arms; but there was nothing in\nsimiles, unless She uttered them.  He looked at the daylight shadows of a\nyellow hue, dancing with the firelight shadows in blue on the whitewashed\nchimney corner, but there was nothing in shadows.  \"Perhaps the new young\nwom--sch--Miss Fancy Day will sing in church with us this morning,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe tranter looked a long time before he replied, \"I fancy she will; and\nyet I fancy she won't.\"\n\nDick implied that such a remark was rather to be tolerated than admired;\nthough deliberateness in speech was known to have, as a rule, more to do\nwith the machinery of the tranter's throat than with the matter\nenunciated.\n\nThey made preparations for going to church as usual; Dick with extreme\nalacrity, though he would not definitely consider why he was so\nreligious.  His wonderful nicety in brushing and cleaning his best light\nboots had features which elevated it to the rank of an art.  Every\nparticle and speck of last week's mud was scraped and brushed from toe\nand heel; new blacking from the packet was carefully mixed and made use\nof, regardless of expense.  A coat was laid on and polished; then another\ncoat for increased blackness; and lastly a third, to give the perfect and\nmirror-like jet which the hoped-for rencounter demanded.\n\nIt being Christmas-day, the tranter prepared himself with Sunday\nparticularity.  Loud sousing and snorting noises were heard to proceed\nfrom a tub in the back quarters of the dwelling, proclaiming that he was\nthere performing his great Sunday wash, lasting half-an-hour, to which\nhis washings on working-day mornings were mere flashes in the pan.\nVanishing into the outhouse with a large brown towel, and the above-named\nbubblings and snortings being carried on for about twenty minutes, the\ntranter would appear round the edge of the door, smelling like a summer\nfog, and looking as if he had just narrowly escaped a watery grave with\nthe loss of much of his clothes, having since been weeping bitterly till\nhis eyes were red; a crystal drop of water hanging ornamentally at the\nbottom of each ear, one at the tip of his nose, and others in the form of\nspangles about his hair.\n\nAfter a great deal of crunching upon the sanded stone floor by the feet\nof father, son, and grandson as they moved to and fro in these\npreparations, the bass-viol and fiddles were taken from their nook, and\nthe strings examined and screwed a little above concert-pitch, that they\nmight keep their tone when the service began, to obviate the awkward\ncontingency of having to retune them at the back of the gallery during a\ncough, sneeze, or amen--an inconvenience which had been known to arise in\ndamp wintry weather.\n\nThe three left the door and paced down Mellstock-lane and across the ewe-\nlease, bearing under their arms the instruments in faded green-baize\nbags, and old brown music-books in their hands; Dick continually finding\nhimself in advance of the other two, and the tranter moving on with toes\nturned outwards to an enormous angle.\n\nAt the foot of an incline the church became visible through the north\ngate, or 'church hatch,' as it was called here.  Seven agile figures in a\nclump were observable beyond, which proved to be the choristers waiting;\nsitting on an altar-tomb to pass the time, and letting their heels dangle\nagainst it.  The musicians being now in sight, the youthful party\nscampered off and rattled up the old wooden stairs of the gallery like a\nregiment of cavalry; the other boys of the parish waiting outside and\nobserving birds, cats, and other creatures till the vicar entered, when\nthey suddenly subsided into sober church-goers, and passed down the aisle\nwith echoing heels.\n\nThe gallery of Mellstock Church had a status and sentiment of its own.  A\nstranger there was regarded with a feeling altogether differing from that\nof the congregation below towards him.  Banished from the nave as an\nintruder whom no originality could make interesting, he was received\nabove as a curiosity that no unfitness could render dull.  The gallery,\ntoo, looked down upon and knew the habits of the nave to its remotest\npeculiarity, and had an extensive stock of exclusive information about\nit; whilst the nave knew nothing of the gallery folk, as gallery folk,\nbeyond their loud-sounding minims and chest notes.  Such topics as that\nthe clerk was always chewing tobacco except at the moment of crying amen;\nthat he had a dust-hole in his pew; that during the sermon certain young\ndaughters of the village had left off caring to read anything so mild as\nthe marriage service for some years, and now regularly studied the one\nwhich chronologically follows it; that a pair of lovers touched fingers\nthrough a knot-hole between their pews in the manner ordained by their\ngreat exemplars, Pyramus and Thisbe; that Mrs. Ledlow, the farmer's wife,\ncounted her money and reckoned her week's marketing expenses during the\nfirst lesson--all news to those below--were stale subjects here.\n\nOld William sat in the centre of the front row, his violoncello between\nhis knees and two singers on each hand.  Behind him, on the left, came\nthe treble singers and Dick; and on the right the tranter and the tenors.\nFarther back was old Mail with the altos and supernumeraries.\n\nBut before they had taken their places, and whilst they were standing in\na circle at the back of the gallery practising a psalm or two, Dick cast\nhis eyes over his grandfather's shoulder, and saw the vision of the past\nnight enter the porch-door as methodically as if she had never been a\nvision at all.  A new atmosphere seemed suddenly to be puffed into the\nancient edifice by her movement, which made Dick's body and soul tingle\nwith novel sensations.  Directed by Shiner, the churchwarden, she\nproceeded to the small aisle on the north side of the chancel, a spot now\nallotted to a throng of Sunday-school girls, and distinctly visible from\nthe gallery-front by looking under the curve of the furthermost arch on\nthat side.\n\nBefore this moment the church had seemed comparatively empty--now it was\nthronged; and as Miss Fancy rose from her knees and looked around her for\na permanent place in which to deposit herself--finally choosing the\nremotest corner--Dick began to breathe more freely the warm new air she\nhad brought with her; to feel rushings of blood, and to have impressions\nthat there was a tie between her and himself visible to all the\ncongregation.\n\nEver afterwards the young man could recollect individually each part of\nthe service of that bright Christmas morning, and the trifling\noccurrences which took place as its minutes slowly drew along; the duties\nof that day dividing themselves by a complete line from the services of\nother times.  The tunes they that morning essayed remained with him for\nyears, apart from all others; also the text; also the appearance of the\nlayer of dust upon the capitals of the piers; that the holly-bough in the\nchancel archway was hung a little out of the centre--all the ideas, in\nshort, that creep into the mind when reason is only exercising its lowest\nactivity through the eye.\n\nBy chance or by fate, another young man who attended Mellstock Church on\nthat Christmas morning had towards the end of the service the same\ninstinctive perception of an interesting presence, in the shape of the\nsame bright maiden, though his emotion reached a far less developed\nstage.  And there was this difference, too, that the person in question\nwas surprised at his condition, and sedulously endeavoured to reduce\nhimself to his normal state of mind.  He was the young vicar, Mr.\nMaybold.\n\nThe music on Christmas mornings was frequently below the standard of\nchurch-performances at other times.  The boys were sleepy from the heavy\nexertions of the night; the men were slightly wearied; and now, in\naddition to these constant reasons, there was a dampness in the\natmosphere that still further aggravated the evil.  Their strings, from\nthe recent long exposure to the night air, rose whole semitones, and\nsnapped with a loud twang at the most silent moment; which necessitated\nmore retiring than ever to the back of the gallery, and made the gallery\nthroats quite husky with the quantity of coughing and hemming required\nfor tuning in.  The vicar looked cross.\n\nWhen the singing was in progress there was suddenly discovered to be a\nstrong and shrill reinforcement from some point, ultimately found to be\nthe school-girls' aisle.  At every attempt it grew bolder and more\ndistinct.  At the third time of singing, these intrusive feminine voices\nwere as mighty as those of the regular singers; in fact, the flood of\nsound from this quarter assumed such an individuality, that it had a\ntime, a key, almost a tune of its own, surging upwards when the gallery\nplunged downwards, and the reverse.\n\nNow this had never happened before within the memory of man.  The girls,\nlike the rest of the congregation, had always been humble and respectful\nfollowers of the gallery; singing at sixes and sevens if without gallery\nleaders; never interfering with the ordinances of these practised\nartists--having no will, union, power, or proclivity except it was given\nthem from the established choir enthroned above them.\n\nA good deal of desperation became noticeable in the gallery throats and\nstrings, which continued throughout the musical portion of the service.\nDirectly the fiddles were laid down, Mr. Penny's spectacles put in their\nsheath, and the text had been given out, an indignant whispering began.\n\n\"Did ye hear that, souls?\" Mr. Penny said, in a groaning breath.\n\n\"Brazen-faced hussies!\" said Bowman.\n\n\"True; why, they were every note as loud as we, fiddles and all, if not\nlouder!\"\n\n\"Fiddles and all!\" echoed Bowman bitterly.\n\n\"Shall anything saucier be found than united 'ooman?\" Mr. Spinks\nmurmured.\n\n\"What I want to know is,\" said the tranter (as if he knew already, but\nthat civilization required the form of words), \"what business people have\nto tell maidens to sing like that when they don't sit in a gallery, and\nnever have entered one in their lives?  That's the question, my sonnies.\"\n\n\"'Tis the gallery have got to sing, all the world knows,\" said Mr. Penny.\n\"Why, souls, what's the use o' the ancients spending scores of pounds to\nbuild galleries if people down in the lowest depths of the church sing\nlike that at a moment's notice?\"\n\n\"Really, I think we useless ones had better march out of church, fiddles\nand all!\" said Mr. Spinks, with a laugh which, to a stranger, would have\nsounded mild and real.  Only the initiated body of men he addressed could\nunderstand the horrible bitterness of irony that lurked under the quiet\nwords 'useless ones,' and the ghastliness of the laughter apparently so\nnatural.\n\n\"Never mind!  Let 'em sing too--'twill make it all the louder--hee, hee!\"\nsaid Leaf.\n\n\"Thomas Leaf, Thomas Leaf!  Where have you lived all your life?\" said\ngrandfather William sternly.\n\nThe quailing Leaf tried to look as if he had lived nowhere at all.\n\n\"When all's said and done, my sonnies,\" Reuben said, \"there'd have been\nno real harm in their singing if they had let nobody hear 'em, and only\njined in now and then.\"\n\n\"None at all,\" said Mr. Penny.  \"But though I don't wish to accuse people\nwrongfully, I'd say before my lord judge that I could hear every note o'\nthat last psalm come from 'em as much as from us--every note as if 'twas\ntheir own.\"\n\n\"Know it! ah, I should think I did know it!\" Mr. Spinks was heard to\nobserve at this moment, without reference to his fellow players--shaking\nhis head at some idea he seemed to see floating before him, and smiling\nas if he were attending a funeral at the time.  \"Ah, do I or don't I know\nit!\"\n\nNo one said \"Know what?\" because all were aware from experience that what\nhe knew would declare itself in process of time.\n\n\"I could fancy last night that we should have some trouble wi' that young\nman,\" said the tranter, pending the continuance of Spinks's speech, and\nlooking towards the unconscious Mr. Maybold in the pulpit.\n\n\"I fancy,\" said old William, rather severely, \"I fancy there's too much\nwhispering going on to be of any spiritual use to gentle or simple.\"  Then\nfolding his lips and concentrating his glance on the vicar, he implied\nthat none but the ignorant would speak again; and accordingly there was\nsilence in the gallery, Mr. Spinks's telling speech remaining for ever\nunspoken.\n\nDick had said nothing, and the tranter little, on this episode of the\nmorning; for Mrs. Dewy at breakfast expressed it as her intention to\ninvite the youthful leader of the culprits to the small party it was\ncustomary with them to have on Christmas night--a piece of knowledge\nwhich had given a particular brightness to Dick's reflections since he\nhad received it.  And in the tranter's slightly-cynical nature, party\nfeeling was weaker than in the other members of the choir, though\nfriendliness and faithful partnership still sustained in him a hearty\nearnestness on their account.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII: THE TRANTER'S PARTY\n\n\nDuring the afternoon unusual activity was seen to prevail about the\nprecincts of tranter Dewy's house.  The flagstone floor was swept of\ndust, and a sprinkling of the finest yellow sand from the innermost\nstratum of the adjoining sand-pit lightly scattered thereupon.  Then were\nproduced large knives and forks, which had been shrouded in darkness and\ngrease since the last occasion of the kind, and bearing upon their sides,\n\"Shear-steel, warranted,\" in such emphatic letters of assurance, that the\nwarranter's name was not required as further proof, and not given.  The\nkey was left in the tap of the cider-barrel, instead of being carried in\na pocket.  And finally the tranter had to stand up in the room and let\nhis wife wheel him round like a turnstile, to see if anything\ndiscreditable was visible in his appearance.\n\n\"Stand still till I've been for the scissors,\" said Mrs. Dewy.\n\nThe tranter stood as still as a sentinel at the challenge.\n\nThe only repairs necessary were a trimming of one or two whiskers that\nhad extended beyond the general contour of the mass; a like trimming of a\nslightly-frayed edge visible on his shirt-collar; and a final tug at a\ngrey hair--to all of which operations he submitted in resigned silence,\nexcept the last, which produced a mild \"Come, come, Ann,\" by way of\nexpostulation.\n\n\"Really, Reuben, 'tis quite a disgrace to see such a man,\" said Mrs.\nDewy, with the severity justifiable in a long-tried companion, giving him\nanother turn round, and picking several of Smiler's hairs from the\nshoulder of his coat.  Reuben's thoughts seemed engaged elsewhere, and he\nyawned.  \"And the collar of your coat is a shame to behold--so plastered\nwith dirt, or dust, or grease, or something.  Why, wherever could you\nhave got it?\"\n\n\"'Tis my warm nater in summer-time, I suppose.  I always did get in such\na heat when I bustle about.\"\n\n\"Ay, the Dewys always were such a coarse-skinned family.  There's your\nbrother Bob just as bad--as fat as a porpoise--wi' his low, mean, 'How'st\ndo, Ann?' whenever he meets me.  I'd 'How'st do' him indeed!  If the sun\nonly shines out a minute, there be you all streaming in the face--I never\nsee!\"\n\n\"If I be hot week-days, I must be hot Sundays.\"\n\n\"If any of the girls should turn after their father 'twill be a bad look-\nout for 'em, poor things!  None of my family were sich vulgar sweaters,\nnot one of 'em.  But, Lord-a-mercy, the Dewys!  I don't know how ever I\ncam' into such a family!\"\n\n\"Your woman's weakness when I asked ye to jine us.  That's how it was I\nsuppose.\"  But the tranter appeared to have heard some such words from\nhis wife before, and hence his answer had not the energy it might have\nshown if the inquiry had possessed the charm of novelty.\n\n\"You never did look so well in a pair o' trousers as in them,\" she\ncontinued in the same unimpassioned voice, so that the unfriendly\ncriticism of the Dewy family seemed to have been more normal than\nspontaneous.  \"Such a cheap pair as 'twas too.  As big as any man could\nwish to have, and lined inside, and double-lined in the lower parts, and\nan extra piece of stiffening at the bottom.  And 'tis a nice high cut\nthat comes up right under your armpits, and there's enough turned down\ninside the seams to make half a pair more, besides a piece of cloth left\nthat will make an honest waistcoat--all by my contriving in buying the\nstuff at a bargain, and having it made up under my eye.  It only shows\nwhat may be done by taking a little trouble, and not going straight to\nthe rascally tailors.\"\n\nThe discourse was cut short by the sudden appearance of Charley on the\nscene, with a face and hands of hideous blackness, and a nose like a\nguttering candle.  Why, on that particularly cleanly afternoon, he should\nhave discovered that the chimney-crook and chain from which the hams were\nsuspended should have possessed more merits and general interest as\nplaythings than any other articles in the house, is a question for\nnursing mothers to decide.  However, the humour seemed to lie in the\nresult being, as has been seen, that any given player with these articles\nwas in the long-run daubed with soot.  The last that was seen of Charley\nby daylight after this piece of ingenuity was when in the act of\nvanishing from his father's presence round the corner of the\nhouse--looking back over his shoulder with an expression of great sin on\nhis face, like Cain as the Outcast in Bible pictures.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe guests had all assembled, and the tranter's party had reached that\ndegree of development which accords with ten o'clock P.M. in rural\nassemblies.  At that hour the sound of a fiddle in process of tuning was\nheard from the inner pantry.\n\n\"That's Dick,\" said the tranter.  \"That lad's crazy for a jig.\"\n\n\"Dick!  Now I cannot--really, I cannot have any dancing at all till\nChristmas-day is out,\" said old William emphatically.  \"When the clock\nha' done striking twelve, dance as much as ye like.\"\n\n\"Well, I must say there's reason in that, William,\" said Mrs. Penny.  \"If\nyou do have a party on Christmas-night, 'tis only fair and honourable to\nthe sky-folk to have it a sit-still party.  Jigging parties be all very\nwell on the Devil's holidays; but a jigging party looks suspicious now.  O\nyes; stop till the clock strikes, young folk--so say I.\"\n\nIt happened that some warm mead accidentally got into Mr. Spinks's head\nabout this time.\n\n\"Dancing,\" he said, \"is a most strengthening, livening, and courting\nmovement, 'specially with a little beverage added!  And dancing is good.\nBut why disturb what is ordained, Richard and Reuben, and the company\nzhinerally?  Why, I ask, as far as that do go?\"\n\n\"Then nothing till after twelve,\" said William.\n\nThough Reuben and his wife ruled on social points, religious questions\nwere mostly disposed of by the old man, whose firmness on this head quite\ncounterbalanced a certain weakness in his handling of domestic matters.\nThe hopes of the younger members of the household were therefore\nrelegated to a distance of one hour and three-quarters--a result that\ntook visible shape in them by a remote and listless look about the\neyes--the singing of songs being permitted in the interim.\n\nAt five minutes to twelve the soft tuning was again heard in the back\nquarters; and when at length the clock had whizzed forth the last stroke,\nDick appeared ready primed, and the instruments were boldly handled; old\nWilliam very readily taking the bass-viol from its accustomed nail, and\ntouching the strings as irreligiously as could be desired.\n\nThe country-dance called the 'Triumph, or Follow my Lover,' was the\nfigure with which they opened.  The tranter took for his partner Mrs.\nPenny, and Mrs. Dewy was chosen by Mr. Penny, who made so much of his\nlimited height by a judicious carriage of the head, straightening of the\nback, and important flashes of his spectacle-glasses, that he seemed\nalmost as tall as the tranter.  Mr. Shiner, age about thirty-five, farmer\nand church-warden, a character principally composed of a crimson stare,\nvigorous breath, and a watch-chain, with a mouth hanging on a dark smile\nbut never smiling, had come quite willingly to the party, and showed a\nwondrous obliviousness of all his antics on the previous night.  But the\ncomely, slender, prettily-dressed prize Fancy Day fell to Dick's lot, in\nspite of some private machinations of the farmer, for the reason that Mr.\nShiner, as a richer man, had shown too much assurance in asking the\nfavour, whilst Dick had been duly courteous.\n\nWe gain a good view of our heroine as she advances to her place in the\nladies' line.  She belonged to the taller division of middle height.\nFlexibility was her first characteristic, by which she appeared to enjoy\nthe most easeful rest when she was in gliding motion.  Her dark\neyes--arched by brows of so keen, slender, and soft a curve, that they\nresembled nothing so much as two slurs in music--showed primarily a\nbright sparkle each.  This was softened by a frequent thoughtfulness, yet\nnot so frequent as to do away, for more than a few minutes at a time,\nwith a certain coquettishness; which in its turn was never so decided as\nto banish honesty.  Her lips imitated her brows in their clearly-cut\noutline and softness of bend; and her nose was well shaped--which is\nsaying a great deal, when it is remembered that there are a hundred\npretty mouths and eyes for one pretty nose.  Add to this, plentiful knots\nof dark-brown hair, a gauzy dress of white, with blue facings; and the\nslightest idea may be gained of the young maiden who showed, amidst the\nrest of the dancing-ladies, like a flower among vegetables.  And so the\ndance proceeded.  Mr. Shiner, according to the interesting rule laid\ndown, deserted his own partner, and made off down the middle with this\nfair one of Dick's--the pair appearing from the top of the room like two\npersons tripping down a lane to be married.  Dick trotted behind with\nwhat was intended to be a look of composure, but which was, in fact, a\nrather silly expression of feature--implying, with too much earnestness,\nthat such an elopement could not be tolerated.  Then they turned and came\nback, when Dick grew more rigid around his mouth, and blushed with\ningenuous ardour as he joined hands with the rival and formed the arch\nover his lady's head; which presumably gave the figure its name;\nrelinquishing her again at setting to partners, when Mr. Shiner's new\nchain quivered in every link, and all the loose flesh upon the\ntranter--who here came into action again--shook like jelly.  Mrs. Penny,\nbeing always rather concerned for her personal safety when she danced\nwith the tranter, fixed her face to a chronic smile of timidity the whole\ntime it lasted--a peculiarity which filled her features with wrinkles,\nand reduced her eyes to little straight lines like hyphens, as she jigged\nup and down opposite him; repeating in her own person not only his proper\nmovements, but also the minor flourishes which the richness of the\ntranter's imagination led him to introduce from time to time--an\nimitation which had about it something of slavish obedience, not unmixed\nwith fear.\n\nThe ear-rings of the ladies now flung themselves wildly about, turning\nviolent summersaults, banging this way and that, and then swinging\nquietly against the ears sustaining them.  Mrs. Crumpler--a heavy woman,\nwho, for some reason which nobody ever thought worth inquiry, danced in a\nclean apron--moved so smoothly through the figure that her feet were\nnever seen; conveying to imaginative minds the idea that she rolled on\ncastors.\n\nMinute after minute glided by, and the party reached the period when\nladies' back-hair begins to look forgotten and dissipated; when a\nperceptible dampness makes itself apparent upon the faces even of\ndelicate girls--a ghastly dew having for some time rained from the\nfeatures of their masculine partners; when skirts begin to be torn out of\ntheir gathers; when elderly people, who have stood up to please their\njuniors, begin to feel sundry small tremblings in the region of the\nknees, and to wish the interminable dance was at Jericho; when (at\ncountry parties of the thorough sort) waistcoats begin to be unbuttoned,\nand when the fiddlers' chairs have been wriggled, by the frantic bowing\nof their occupiers, to a distance of about two feet from where they\noriginally stood.\n\nFancy was dancing with Mr. Shiner.  Dick knew that Fancy, by the law of\ngood manners, was bound to dance as pleasantly with one partner as with\nanother; yet he could not help suggesting to himself that she need not\nhave put quite so much spirit into her steps, nor smiled quite so\nfrequently whilst in the farmer's hands.\n\n\"I'm afraid you didn't cast off,\" said Dick mildly to Mr. Shiner, before\nthe latter man's watch-chain had done vibrating from a recent whirl.\n\nFancy made a motion of accepting the correction; but her partner took no\nnotice, and proceeded with the next movement, with an affectionate bend\ntowards her.\n\n\"That Shiner's too fond of her,\" the young man said to himself as he\nwatched them.  They came to the top again, Fancy smiling warmly towards\nher partner, and went to their places.\n\n\"Mr. Shiner, you didn't cast off,\" said Dick, for want of something else\nto demolish him with; casting off himself, and being put out at the\nfarmer's irregularity.\n\n\"Perhaps I sha'n't cast off for any man,\" said Mr. Shiner.\n\n\"I think you ought to, sir.\"\n\nDick's partner, a young lady of the name of Lizzy--called Lizz for\nshort--tried to mollify.\n\n\"I can't say that I myself have much feeling for casting off,\" she said.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Mrs. Penny, following up the argument, \"especially if a\nfriend and neighbour is set against it.  Not but that 'tis a terrible\ntasty thing in good hands and well done; yes, indeed, so say I.\"\n\n\"All I meant was,\" said Dick, rather sorry that he had spoken\ncorrectingly to a guest, \"that 'tis in the dance; and a man has hardly\nany right to hack and mangle what was ordained by the regular\ndance-maker, who, I daresay, got his living by making 'em, and thought of\nnothing else all his life.\"\n\n\"I don't like casting off: then very well; I cast off for no dance-maker\nthat ever lived.\"\n\nDick now appeared to be doing mental arithmetic, the act being really an\neffort to present to himself, in an abstract form, how far an argument\nwith a formidable rival ought to be carried, when that rival was his\nmother's guest.  The dead-lock was put an end to by the stamping arrival\nup the middle of the tranter, who, despising minutiae on principle,\nstarted a theme of his own.\n\n\"I assure you, neighbours,\" he said, \"the heat of my frame no tongue can\ntell!\"  He looked around and endeavoured to give, by a forcible gaze of\nself-sympathy, some faint idea of the truth.\n\nMrs. Dewy formed one of the next couple.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, in an auxiliary tone, \"Reuben always was such a hot\nman.\"\n\nMrs. Penny implied the species of sympathy that such a class of\naffliction required, by trying to smile and to look grieved at the same\ntime.\n\n\"If he only walk round the garden of a Sunday morning, his shirt-collar\nis as limp as no starch at all,\" continued Mrs. Dewy, her countenance\nlapsing parenthetically into a housewifely expression of concern at the\nreminiscence.\n\n\"Come, come, you women-folk; 'tis hands across--come, come!\" said the\ntranter; and the conversation ceased for the present.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII: THEY DANCE MORE WILDLY\n\n\nDick had at length secured Fancy for that most delightful of\ncountry-dances, opening with six-hands-round.\n\n\"Before we begin,\" said the tranter, \"my proposal is, that 'twould be a\nright and proper plan for every mortal man in the dance to pull off his\njacket, considering the heat.\"\n\n\"Such low notions as you have, Reuben!  Nothing but strip will go down\nwith you when you are a-dancing.  Such a hot man as he is!\"\n\n\"Well, now, look here, my sonnies,\" he argued to his wife, whom he often\naddressed in the plural masculine for economy of epithet merely; \"I don't\nsee that.  You dance and get hot as fire; therefore you lighten your\nclothes.  Isn't that nature and reason for gentle and simple?  If I strip\nby myself and not necessary, 'tis rather pot-housey I own; but if we\nstout chaps strip one and all, why, 'tis the native manners of the\ncountry, which no man can gainsay?  Hey--what did you say, my sonnies?\"\n\n\"Strip we will!\" said the three other heavy men who were in the dance;\nand their coats were accordingly taken off and hung in the passage,\nwhence the four sufferers from heat soon reappeared, marching in close\ncolumn, with flapping shirt-sleeves, and having, as common to them all, a\ngeneral glance of being now a match for any man or dancer in England or\nIreland.  Dick, fearing to lose ground in Fancy's good opinion, retained\nhis coat like the rest of the thinner men; and Mr. Shiner did the same\nfrom superior knowledge.\n\nAnd now a further phase of revelry had disclosed itself.  It was the time\nof night when a guest may write his name in the dust upon the tables and\nchairs, and a bluish mist pervades the atmosphere, becoming a distinct\nhalo round the candles; when people's nostrils, wrinkles, and crevices in\ngeneral, seem to be getting gradually plastered up; when the very\nfiddlers as well as the dancers get red in the face, the dancers having\nadvanced further still towards incandescence, and entered the cadaverous\nphase; the fiddlers no longer sit down, but kick back their chairs and\nsaw madly at the strings, with legs firmly spread and eyes closed,\nregardless of the visible world.  Again and again did Dick share his\nLove's hand with another man, and wheel round; then, more delightfully,\npromenade in a circle with her all to himself, his arm holding her waist\nmore firmly each time, and his elbow getting further and further behind\nher back, till the distance reached was rather noticeable; and, most\nblissful, swinging to places shoulder to shoulder, her breath curling\nround his neck like a summer zephyr that had strayed from its proper\ndate.  Threading the couples one by one they reached the bottom, when\nthere arose in Dick's mind a minor misery lest the tune should end before\nthey could work their way to the top again, and have anew the same\nexciting run down through.  Dick's feelings on actually reaching the top\nin spite of his doubts were supplemented by a mortal fear that the\nfiddling might even stop at this supreme moment; which prompted him to\nconvey a stealthy whisper to the far-gone musicians, to the effect that\nthey were not to leave off till he and his partner had reached the bottom\nof the dance once more, which remark was replied to by the nearest of\nthose convulsed and quivering men by a private nod to the anxious young\nman between two semiquavers of the tune, and a simultaneous \"All right,\nay, ay,\" without opening the eyes.  Fancy was now held so closely that\nDick and she were practically one person.  The room became to Dick like a\npicture in a dream; all that he could remember of it afterwards being the\nlook of the fiddlers going to sleep, as humming-tops sleep, by increasing\ntheir motion and hum, together with the figures of grandfather James and\nold Simon Crumpler sitting by the chimney-corner, talking and nodding in\ndumb-show, and beating the air to their emphatic sentences like people\nnear a threshing machine.\n\nThe dance ended.  \"Piph-h-h-h!\" said tranter Dewy, blowing out his breath\nin the very finest stream of vapour that a man's lips could form.  \"A\nregular tightener, that one, sonnies!\"  He wiped his forehead, and went\nto the cider and ale mugs on the table.\n\n\"Well!\" said Mrs. Penny, flopping into a chair, \"my heart haven't been in\nsuch a thumping state of uproar since I used to sit up on old Midsummer-\neves to see who my husband was going to be.\"\n\n\"And that's getting on for a good few years ago now, from what I've heard\nyou tell,\" said the tranter, without lifting his eyes from the cup he was\nfilling.  Being now engaged in the business of handing round\nrefreshments, he was warranted in keeping his coat off still, though the\nother heavy men had resumed theirs.\n\n\"And a thing I never expected would come to pass, if you'll believe me,\ncame to pass then,\" continued Mrs. Penny.  \"Ah, the first spirit ever I\nsee on a Midsummer-eve was a puzzle to me when he appeared, a hard\npuzzle, so say I!\"\n\n\"So I should have fancied,\" said Elias Spinks.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Penny, throwing her glance into past times, and talking\non in a running tone of complacent abstraction, as if a listener were not\na necessity.  \"Yes; never was I in such a taking as on that Midsummer-\neve!  I sat up, quite determined to see if John Wildway was going to\nmarry me or no.  I put the bread-and-cheese and beer quite ready, as the\nwitch's book ordered, and I opened the door, and I waited till the clock\nstruck twelve, my nerves all alive and so strained that I could feel\nevery one of 'em twitching like bell-wires.  Yes, sure! and when the\nclock had struck, lo and behold, I could see through the door a little\nsmall man in the lane wi' a shoemaker's apron on.\"\n\nHere Mr. Penny stealthily enlarged himself half an inch.\n\n\"Now, John Wildway,\" Mrs. Penny continued, \"who courted me at that time,\nwas a shoemaker, you see, but he was a very fair-sized man, and I\ncouldn't believe that any such a little small man had anything to do wi'\nme, as anybody might.  But on he came, and crossed the threshold--not\nJohn, but actually the same little small man in the shoemaker's apron--\"\n\n\"You needn't be so mighty particular about little and small!\" said her\nhusband.\n\n\"In he walks, and down he sits, and O my goodness me, didn't I flee\nupstairs, body and soul hardly hanging together!  Well, to cut a long\nstory short, by-long and by-late, John Wildway and I had a miff and\nparted; and lo and behold, the coming man came!  Penny asked me if I'd go\nsnacks with him, and afore I knew what I was about a'most, the thing was\ndone.\"\n\n\"I've fancied you never knew better in your life; but I mid be mistaken,\"\nsaid Mr. Penny in a murmur.\n\nAfter Mrs. Penny had spoken, there being no new occupation for her eyes,\nshe still let them stay idling on the past scenes just related, which\nwere apparently visible to her in the centre of the room.  Mr. Penny's\nremark received no reply.\n\nDuring this discourse the tranter and his wife might have been observed\nstanding in an unobtrusive corner, in mysterious closeness to each other,\na just perceptible current of intelligence passing from each to each,\nwhich had apparently no relation whatever to the conversation of their\nguests, but much to their sustenance.  A conclusion of some kind having\nat length been drawn, the palpable confederacy of man and wife was once\nmore obliterated, the tranter marching off into the pantry, humming a\ntune that he couldn't quite recollect, and then breaking into the words\nof a song of which he could remember about one line and a quarter.  Mrs.\nDewy spoke a few words about preparations for a bit of supper.\n\nThat elder portion of the company which loved eating and drinking put on\na look to signify that till this moment they had quite forgotten that it\nwas customary to expect suppers on these occasions; going even further\nthan this politeness of feature, and starting irrelevant subjects, the\nexceeding flatness and forced tone of which rather betrayed their object.\nThe younger members said they were quite hungry, and that supper would be\ndelightful though it was so late.\n\nGood luck attended Dick's love-passes during the meal.  He sat next\nFancy, and had the thrilling pleasure of using permanently a glass which\nhad been taken by Fancy in mistake; of letting the outer edge of the sole\nof his boot touch the lower verge of her skirt; and to add to these\ndelights the cat, which had lain unobserved in her lap for several\nminutes, crept across into his own, touching him with fur that had\ntouched her hand a moment before.  There were, besides, some little\npleasures in the shape of helping her to vegetable she didn't want, and\nwhen it had nearly alighted on her plate taking it across for his own\nuse, on the plea of waste not, want not.  He also, from time to time,\nsipped sweet sly glances at her profile; noticing the set of her head,\nthe curve of her throat, and other artistic properties of the lively\ngoddess, who the while kept up a rather free, not to say too free,\nconversation with Mr. Shiner sitting opposite; which, after some uneasy\ncriticism, and much shifting of argument backwards and forwards in Dick's\nmind, he decided not to consider of alarming significance.\n\n\"A new music greets our ears now,\" said Miss Fancy, alluding, with the\nsharpness that her position as village sharpener demanded, to the\ncontrast between the rattle of knives and forks and the late notes of the\nfiddlers.\n\n\"Ay; and I don't know but what 'tis sweeter in tone when you get above\nforty,\" said the tranter; \"except, in faith, as regards father there.\nNever such a mortal man as he for tunes.  They do move his soul; don't\n'em, father?\"\n\nThe eldest Dewy smiled across from his distant chair an assent to\nReuben's remark.\n\n\"Spaking of being moved in soul,\" said Mr. Penny, \"I shall never forget\nthe first time I heard the 'Dead March.'  'Twas at poor Corp'l Nineman's\nfuneral at Casterbridge.  It fairly made my hair creep and fidget about\nlike a vlock of sheep--ah, it did, souls!  And when they had done, and\nthe last trump had sounded, and the guns was fired over the dead hero's\ngrave, a' icy-cold drop o' moist sweat hung upon my forehead, and another\nupon my jawbone.  Ah, 'tis a very solemn thing!\"\n\n\"Well, as to father in the corner there,\" the tranter said, pointing to\nold William, who was in the act of filling his mouth; \"he'd starve to\ndeath for music's sake now, as much as when he was a boy-chap of\nfifteen.\"\n\n\"Truly, now,\" said Michael Mail, clearing the corner of his throat in the\nmanner of a man who meant to be convincing; \"there's a friendly tie of\nsome sort between music and eating.\"  He lifted the cup to his mouth, and\ndrank himself gradually backwards from a perpendicular position to a\nslanting one, during which time his looks performed a circuit from the\nwall opposite him to the ceiling overhead.  Then clearing the other\ncorner of his throat: \"Once I was a-setting in the little kitchen of the\nDree Mariners at Casterbridge, having a bit of dinner, and a brass band\nstruck up in the street.  Such a beautiful band as that were!  I was\nsetting eating fried liver and lights, I well can mind--ah, I was! and to\nsave my life, I couldn't help chawing to the tune.  Band played six-eight\ntime; six-eight chaws I, willynilly.  Band plays common; common time went\nmy teeth among the liver and lights as true as a hair.  Beautiful 'twere!\nAh, I shall never forget that there band!\"\n\n\"That's as tuneful a thing as ever I heard of,\" said grandfather James,\nwith the absent gaze which accompanies profound criticism.\n\n\"I don't like Michael's tuneful stories then,\" said Mrs. Dewy.  \"They are\nquite coarse to a person o' decent taste.\"\n\nOld Michael's mouth twitched here and there, as if he wanted to smile but\ndidn't know where to begin, which gradually settled to an expression that\nit was not displeasing for a nice woman like the tranter's wife to\ncorrect him.\n\n\"Well, now,\" said Reuben, with decisive earnestness, \"that sort o' coarse\ntouch that's so upsetting to Ann's feelings is to my mind a\nrecommendation; for it do always prove a story to be true.  And for the\nsame reason, I like a story with a bad moral.  My sonnies, all true\nstories have a coarse touch or a bad moral, depend upon't.  If the story-\ntellers could ha' got decency and good morals from true stories, who'd\nha' troubled to invent parables?\"  Saying this the tranter arose to fetch\na new stock of cider, ale, mead, and home-made wines.\n\nMrs. Dewy sighed, and appended a remark (ostensibly behind her husband's\nback, though that the words should reach his ears distinctly was\nunderstood by both): \"Such a man as Dewy is!  Nobody do know the trouble\nI have to keep that man barely respectable.  And did you ever hear\ntoo--just now at supper-time--talking about 'taties' with Michael in such\na work-folk way.  Well, 'tis what I was never brought up to!  With our\nfamily 'twas never less than 'taters,' and very often 'pertatoes'\noutright; mother was so particular and nice with us girls there was no\nfamily in the parish that kept them selves up more than we.\"\n\nThe hour of parting came.  Fancy could not remain for the night, because\nshe had engaged a woman to wait up for her.  She disappeared temporarily\nfrom the flagging party of dancers, and then came downstairs wrapped up\nand looking altogether a different person from whom she had been\nhitherto, in fact (to Dick's sadness and disappointment), a woman\nsomewhat reserved and of a phlegmatic temperament--nothing left in her of\nthe romping girl that she had seemed but a short quarter-hour before, who\nhad not minded the weight of Dick's hand upon her waist, nor shirked the\npurlieus of the mistletoe.\n\n\"What a difference!\" thought the young man--hoary cynic pro tem.  \"What a\nmiserable deceiving difference between the manners of a maid's life at\ndancing times and at others!  Look at this lovely Fancy!  Through the\nwhole past evening touchable, squeezeable--even kissable!  For whole half-\nhours I held her so chose to me that not a sheet of paper could have been\nshipped between us; and I could feel her heart only just outside my own,\nher life beating on so close to mine, that I was aware of every breath in\nit.  A flit is made upstairs--a hat and a cloak put on--and I no more\ndare to touch her than--\"  Thought failed him, and he returned to\nrealities.\n\nBut this was an endurable misery in comparison with what followed.  Mr.\nShiner and his watch-chain, taking the intrusive advantage that ardent\nbachelors who are going homeward along the same road as a pretty young\nwoman always do take of that circumstance, came forward to assure\nFancy--with a total disregard of Dick's emotions, and in tones which were\ncertainly not frigid--that he (Shiner) was not the man to go to bed\nbefore seeing his Lady Fair safe within her own door--not he, nobody\nshould say he was that;--and that he would not leave her side an inch\ntill the thing was done--drown him if he would.  The proposal was\nassented to by Miss Day, in Dick's foreboding judgment, with one\ndegree--or at any rate, an appreciable fraction of a degree--of warmth\nbeyond that required by a disinterested desire for protection from the\ndangers of the night.\n\nAll was over; and Dick surveyed the chair she had last occupied, looking\nnow like a setting from which the gem has been torn.  There stood her\nglass, and the romantic teaspoonful of elder wine at the bottom that she\ncouldn't drink by trying ever so hard, in obedience to the mighty\narguments of the tranter (his hand coming down upon her shoulder the\nwhile, like a Nasmyth hammer); but the drinker was there no longer.  There\nwere the nine or ten pretty little crumbs she had left on her plate; but\nthe eater was no more seen.\n\nThere seemed a disagreeable closeness of relationship between himself and\nthe members of his family, now that they were left alone again face to\nface.  His father seemed quite offensive for appearing to be in just as\nhigh spirits as when the guests were there; and as for grandfather James\n(who had not yet left), he was quite fiendish in being rather glad they\nwere gone.\n\n\"Really,\" said the tranter, in a tone of placid satisfaction, \"I've had\nso little time to attend to myself all the evenen, that I mean to enjoy a\nquiet meal now!  A slice of this here ham--neither too fat nor too\nlean--so; and then a drop of this vinegar and pickles--there, that's\nit--and I shall be as fresh as a lark again!  And to tell the truth, my\nsonny, my inside has been as dry as a lime-basket all night.\"\n\n\"I like a party very well once in a while,\" said Mrs. Dewy, leaving off\nthe adorned tones she had been bound to use throughout the evening, and\nreturning to the natural marriage voice; \"but, Lord, 'tis such a sight of\nheavy work next day!  What with the dirty plates, and knives and forks,\nand dust and smother, and bits kicked off your furniture, and I don't\nknow what all, why a body could a'most wish there were no such things as\nChristmases . . . Ah-h dear!\" she yawned, till the clock in the corner\nhad ticked several beats.  She cast her eyes round upon the displaced,\ndust-laden furniture, and sank down overpowered at the sight.\n\n\"Well, I be getting all right by degrees, thank the Lord for't!\" said the\ntranter cheerfully through a mangled mass of ham and bread, without\nlifting his eyes from his plate, and chopping away with his knife and\nfork as if he were felling trees.  \"Ann, you may as well go on to bed at\nonce, and not bide there making such sleepy faces; you look as\nlong-favoured as a fiddle, upon my life, Ann.  There, you must be wearied\nout, 'tis true.  I'll do the doors and draw up the clock; and you go on,\nor you'll be as white as a sheet to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Ay; I don't know whether I shan't or no.\"  The matron passed her hand\nacross her eyes to brush away the film of sleep till she got upstairs.\n\nDick wondered how it was that when people were married they could be so\nblind to romance; and was quite certain that if he ever took to wife that\ndear impossible Fancy, he and she would never be so dreadfully practical\nand undemonstrative of the Passion as his father and mother were.  The\nmost extraordinary thing was, that all the fathers and mothers he knew\nwere just as undemonstrative as his own.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX: DICK CALLS AT THE SCHOOL\n\n\nThe early days of the year drew on, and Fancy, having spent the holiday\nweeks at home, returned again to Mellstock.\n\nEvery spare minute of the week following her return was used by Dick in\naccidentally passing the schoolhouse in his journeys about the\nneighbourhood; but not once did she make herself visible.  A handkerchief\nbelonging to her had been providentially found by his mother in clearing\nthe rooms the day after that of the dance; and by much contrivance Dick\ngot it handed over to him, to leave with her at any time he should be\nnear the school after her return.  But he delayed taking the extreme\nmeasure of calling with it lest, had she really no sentiment of interest\nin him, it might be regarded as a slightly absurd errand, the reason\nguessed; and the sense of the ludicrous, which was rather keen in her, do\nhis dignity considerable injury in her eyes; and what she thought of him,\neven apart from the question of her loving, was all the world to him now.\n\nBut the hour came when the patience of love at twenty-one could endure no\nlonger.  One Saturday he approached the school with a mild air of\nindifference, and had the satisfaction of seeing the object of his quest\nat the further end of her garden, trying, by the aid of a spade and\ngloves, to root a bramble that had intruded itself there.\n\nHe disguised his feelings from some suspicious-looking cottage-windows\nopposite by endeavouring to appear like a man in a great hurry of\nbusiness, who wished to leave the handkerchief and have done with such\ntrifling errands.\n\nThis endeavour signally failed; for on approaching the gate he found it\nlocked to keep the children, who were playing 'cross-dadder' in the\nfront, from running into her private grounds.\n\nShe did not see him; and he could only think of one thing to be done,\nwhich was to shout her name.\n\n\"Miss Day!\"\n\nThe words were uttered with a jerk and a look meant to imply to the\ncottages opposite that he was now simply one who liked shouting as a\npleasant way of passing his time, without any reference to persons in\ngardens.  The name died away, and the unconscious Miss Day continued\ndigging and pulling as before.\n\nHe screwed himself up to enduring the cottage-windows yet more stoically,\nand shouted again.  Fancy took no notice whatever.\n\nHe shouted the third time, with desperate vehemence, turning suddenly\nabout and retiring a little distance, as if it were by no means for his\nown pleasure that he had come.\n\nThis time she heard him, came down the garden, and entered the school at\nthe back.  Footsteps echoed across the interior, the door opened, and\nthree-quarters of the blooming young schoolmistress's face and figure\nstood revealed before him; a slice on her left-hand side being cut off by\nthe edge of the door.  Having surveyed and recognized him, she came to\nthe gate.\n\nAt sight of him had the pink of her cheeks increased, lessened, or did it\ncontinue to cover its normal area of ground?  It was a question meditated\nseveral hundreds of times by her visitor in after-hours--the meditation,\nafter wearying involutions, always ending in one way, that it was\nimpossible to say.\n\n\"Your handkerchief: Miss Day: I called with.\"  He held it out\nspasmodically and awkwardly.  \"Mother found it: under a chair.\"\n\n\"O, thank you very much for bringing it, Mr. Dewy.  I couldn't think\nwhere I had dropped it.\"\n\nNow Dick, not being an experienced lover--indeed, never before having\nbeen engaged in the practice of love-making at all, except in a small\nschoolboy way--could not take advantage of the situation; and out came\nthe blunder, which afterwards cost him so many bitter moments and a\nsleepless night:-\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Day.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Dewy.\"\n\nThe gate was closed; she was gone; and Dick was standing outside,\nunchanged in his condition from what he had been before he called.  Of\ncourse the Angel was not to blame--a young woman living alone in a house\ncould not ask him indoors unless she had known him better--he should have\nkept her outside before floundering into that fatal farewell.  He wished\nthat before he called he had realized more fully than he did the pleasure\nof being about to call; and turned away.\n\n\n\n\nPART THE SECOND--SPRING\n\n\nCHAPTER I: PASSING BY THE SCHOOL\n\n\nIt followed that, as the spring advanced, Dick walked abroad much more\nfrequently than had hitherto been usual with him, and was continually\nfinding that his nearest way to or from home lay by the road which\nskirted the garden of the school.  The first-fruits of his perseverance\nwere that, on turning the angle on the nineteenth journey by that track,\nhe saw Miss Fancy's figure, clothed in a dark-gray dress, looking from a\nhigh open window upon the crown of his hat.  The friendly greeting\nresulting from this rencounter was considered so valuable an elixir that\nDick passed still oftener; and by the time he had almost trodden a little\npath under the fence where never a path was before, he was rewarded with\nan actual meeting face to face on the open road before her gate.  This\nbrought another meeting, and another, Fancy faintly showing by her\nbearing that it was a pleasure to her of some kind to see him there; but\nthe sort of pleasure she derived, whether exultation at the hope her\nexceeding fairness inspired, or the true feeling which was alone Dick's\nconcern, he could not anyhow decide, although he meditated on her every\nlittle movement for hours after it was made.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II: A MEETING OF THE QUIRE\n\n\nIt was the evening of a fine spring day.  The descending sun appeared as\na nebulous blaze of amber light, its outline being lost in cloudy masses\nhanging round it, like wild locks of hair.\n\nThe chief members of Mellstock parish choir were standing in a group in\nfront of Mr. Penny's workshop in the lower village.  They were all\nbrightly illuminated, and each was backed up by a shadow as long as a\nsteeple; the lowness of the source of light rendering the brims of their\nhats of no use at all as a protection to the eyes.\n\nMr. Penny's was the last house in that part of the parish, and stood in a\nhollow by the roadside so that cart-wheels and horses' legs were about\nlevel with the sill of his shop-window.  This was low and wide, and was\nopen from morning till evening, Mr. Penny himself being invariably seen\nworking inside, like a framed portrait of a shoemaker by some modern\nMoroni.  He sat facing the road, with a boot on his knees and the awl in\nhis hand, only looking up for a moment as he stretched out his arms and\nbent forward at the pull, when his spectacles flashed in the passer's\nface with a shine of flat whiteness, and then returned again to the boot\nas usual.  Rows of lasts, small and large, stout and slender, covered the\nwall which formed the background, in the extreme shadow of which a kind\nof dummy was seen sitting, in the shape of an apprentice with a string\ntied round his hair (probably to keep it out of his eyes).  He smiled at\nremarks that floated in from without, but was never known to answer them\nin Mr. Penny's presence.  Outside the window the upper-leather of a\nWellington-boot was usually hung, pegged to a board as if to dry.  No\nsign was over his door; in fact--as with old banks and mercantile\nhouses--advertising in any shape was scorned, and it would have been felt\nas beneath his dignity to paint up, for the benefit of strangers, the\nname of an establishment whose trade came solely by connection based on\npersonal respect.\n\nHis visitors now came and stood on the outside of his window, sometimes\nleaning against the sill, sometimes moving a pace or two backwards and\nforwards in front of it.  They talked with deliberate gesticulations to\nMr. Penny, enthroned in the shadow of the interior.\n\n\"I do like a man to stick to men who be in the same line o' life--o'\nSundays, anyway--that I do so.\"\n\n\"'Tis like all the doings of folk who don't know what a day's work is,\nthat's what I say.\"\n\n\"My belief is the man's not to blame; 'tis she--she's the bitter weed!\"\n\n\"No, not altogether.  He's a poor gawk-hammer.  Look at his sermon\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"His sermon was well enough, a very good guessable sermon, only he\ncouldn't put it into words and speak it.  That's all was the matter wi'\nthe sermon.  He hadn't been able to get it past his pen.\"\n\n\"Well--ay, the sermon might have been good; for, 'tis true, the sermon of\nOld Eccl'iastes himself lay in Eccl'iastes's ink-bottle afore he got it\nout.\"\n\nMr. Penny, being in the act of drawing the last stitch tight, could\nafford time to look up and throw in a word at this point.\n\n\"He's no spouter--that must be said, 'a b'lieve.\"\n\n\"'Tis a terrible muddle sometimes with the man, as far as spout do go,\"\nsaid Spinks.\n\n\"Well, we'll say nothing about that,\" the tranter answered; \"for I don't\nbelieve 'twill make a penneth o' difference to we poor martels here or\nhereafter whether his sermons be good or bad, my sonnies.\"\n\nMr. Penny made another hole with his awl, pushed in the thread, and\nlooked up and spoke again at the extension of arms.\n\n\"'Tis his goings-on, souls, that's what it is.\"  He clenched his features\nfor an Herculean addition to the ordinary pull, and continued, \"The first\nthing he done when he came here was to be hot and strong about church\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Spinks; \"that was the very first thing he done.\"\n\nMr. Penny, having now been offered the ear of the assembly, accepted it,\nceased stitching, swallowed an unimportant quantity of air as if it were\na pill, and continued:\n\n\"The next thing he do do is to think about altering the church, until he\nfound 'twould be a matter o' cost and what not, and then not to think no\nmore about it.\"\n\n\"True: that was the next thing he done.\"\n\n\"And the next thing was to tell the young chaps that they were not on no\naccount to put their hats in the christening font during service.\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\n\"And then 'twas this, and then 'twas that, and now 'tis--\"\n\nWords were not forcible enough to conclude the sentence, and Mr. Penny\ngave a huge pull to signify the concluding word.\n\n\"Now 'tis to turn us out of the quire neck and crop,\" said the tranter\nafter an interval of half a minute, not by way of explaining the pause\nand pull, which had been quite understood, but as a means of keeping the\nsubject well before the meeting.\n\nMrs. Penny came to the door at this point in the discussion.  Like all\ngood wives, however much she was inclined to play the Tory to her\nhusband's Whiggism, and vice versa, in times of peace, she coalesced with\nhim heartily enough in time of war.\n\n\"It must be owned he's not all there,\" she replied in a general way to\nthe fragments of talk she had heard from indoors.  \"Far below poor Mr.\nGrinham\" (the late vicar).\n\n\"Ay, there was this to be said for he, that you were quite sure he'd\nnever come mumbudgeting to see ye, just as you were in the middle of your\nwork, and put you out with his fuss and trouble about ye.\"\n\n\"Never.  But as for this new Mr. Maybold, though he mid be a very well-\nintending party in that respect, he's unbearable; for as to sifting your\ncinders, scrubbing your floors, or emptying your slops, why, you can't do\nit.  I assure you I've not been able to empt them for several days,\nunless I throw 'em up the chimley or out of winder; for as sure as the\nsun you meet him at the door, coming to ask how you are, and 'tis such a\nconfusing thing to meet a gentleman at the door when ye are in the mess\no' washing.\"\n\n\"'Tis only for want of knowing better, poor gentleman,\" said the tranter.\n\"His meaning's good enough.  Ay, your pa'son comes by fate: 'tis heads or\ntails, like pitch-halfpenny, and no choosing; so we must take en as he\nis, my sonnies, and thank God he's no worse, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I fancy I've seen him look across at Miss Day in a warmer way than\nChristianity asked for,\" said Mrs. Penny musingly; \"but I don't quite\nlike to say it.\"\n\n\"O no; there's nothing in that,\" said grandfather William.\n\n\"If there's nothing, we shall see nothing,\" Mrs. Penny replied, in the\ntone of a woman who might possibly have private opinions still.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Grinham was the man!\" said Bowman.  \"Why, he never troubled us\nwi' a visit from year's end to year's end.  You might go anywhere, do\nanything: you'd be sure never to see him.\"\n\n\"Yes, he was a right sensible pa'son,\" said Michael.  \"He never entered\nour door but once in his life, and that was to tell my poor wife--ay,\npoor soul, dead and gone now, as we all shall!--that as she was such a'\nold aged person, and lived so far from the church, he didn't at all\nexpect her to come any more to the service.\"\n\n\"And 'a was a very jinerous gentleman about choosing the psalms and hymns\no' Sundays.  'Confound ye,' says he, 'blare and scrape what ye will, but\ndon't bother me!'\"\n\n\"And he was a very honourable man in not wanting any of us to come and\nhear him if we were all on-end for a jaunt or spree, or to bring the\nbabies to be christened if they were inclined to squalling.  There's good\nin a man's not putting a parish to unnecessary trouble.\"\n\n\"And there's this here man never letting us have a bit o' peace; but\nkeeping on about being good and upright till 'tis carried to such a pitch\nas I never see the like afore nor since!\"\n\n\"No sooner had he got here than he found the font wouldn't hold water, as\nit hadn't for years off and on; and when I told him that Mr. Grinham\nnever minded it, but used to spet upon his vinger and christen 'em just\nas well, 'a said, 'Good Heavens!  Send for a workman immediate.  What\nplace have I come to!'  Which was no compliment to us, come to that.\"\n\n\"Still, for my part,\" said old William, \"though he's arrayed against us,\nI like the hearty borussnorus ways of the new pa'son.\"\n\n\"You, ready to die for the quire,\" said Bowman reproachfully, \"to stick\nup for the quire's enemy, William!\"\n\n\"Nobody will feel the loss of our church-work so much as I,\" said the old\nman firmly; \"that you d'all know.  I've a-been in the quire man and boy\never since I was a chiel of eleven.  But for all that 'tisn't in me to\ncall the man a bad man, because I truly and sincerely believe en to be a\ngood young feller.\"\n\nSome of the youthful sparkle that used to reside there animated William's\neye as he uttered the words, and a certain nobility of aspect was also\nimparted to him by the setting sun, which gave him a Titanic shadow at\nleast thirty feet in length, stretching away to the east in outlines of\nimposing magnitude, his head finally terminating upon the trunk of a\ngrand old oak-tree.\n\n\"Mayble's a hearty feller enough,\" the tranter replied, \"and will spak to\nyou be you dirty or be you clane.  The first time I met en was in a\ndrong, and though 'a didn't know me no more than the dead, 'a passed the\ntime of day.  'D'ye do?' he said, says he, nodding his head.  'A fine\nday.'  Then the second time I met en was full-buff in town street, when\nmy breeches were tore into a long strent by getting through a copse of\nthorns and brimbles for a short cut home-along; and not wanting to\ndisgrace the man by spaking in that state, I fixed my eye on the\nweathercock to let en pass me as a stranger.  But no: 'How d'ye do,\nReuben?' says he, right hearty, and shook my hand.  If I'd been dressed\nin silver spangles from top to toe, the man couldn't have been civiller.\"\n\nAt this moment Dick was seen coming up the village-street, and they\nturned and watched him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III: A TURN IN THE DISCUSSION\n\n\n\"I'm afraid Dick's a lost man,\" said the tranter.\n\n\"What?--no!\" said Mail, implying by his manner that it was a far commoner\nthing for his ears to report what was not said than that his judgment\nshould be at fault.\n\n\"Ay,\" said the tranter, still gazing at Dick's unconscious advance.  \"I\ndon't at all like what I see!  There's too many o' them looks out of the\nwinder without noticing anything; too much shining of boots; too much\npeeping round corners; too much looking at the clock; telling about\nclever things she did till you be sick of it; and then upon a hint to\nthat effect a horrible silence about her.  I've walked the path once in\nmy life and know the country, neighbours; and Dick's a lost man!\"  The\ntranter turned a quarter round and smiled a smile of miserable satire at\nthe setting new moon, which happened to catch his eye.\n\nThe others became far too serious at this announcement to allow them to\nspeak; and they still regarded Dick in the distance.\n\n\"'Twas his mother's fault,\" the tranter continued, \"in asking the young\nwoman to our party last Christmas.  When I eyed the blue frock and light\nheels o' the maid, I had my thoughts directly.  'God bless thee, Dicky my\nsonny,' I said to myself; 'there's a delusion for thee!'\"\n\n\"They seemed to be rather distant in manner last Sunday, I thought?\" Mail\ntentatively observed, as became one who was not a member of the family.\n\n\"Ay, that's a part of the zickness.  Distance belongs to it, slyness\nbelongs to it, queerest things on earth belongs to it!  There, 'tmay as\nwell come early as late s'far as I know.  The sooner begun, the sooner\nover; for come it will.\"\n\n\"The question I ask is,\" said Mr. Spinks, connecting into one thread the\ntwo subjects of discourse, as became a man learned in rhetoric, and\nbeating with his hand in a way which signified that the manner rather\nthan the matter of his speech was to be observed, \"how did Mr. Maybold\nknow she could play the organ?  You know we had it from her own lips, as\nfar as lips go, that she has never, first or last, breathed such a thing\nto him; much less that she ever would play.\"\n\nIn the midst of this puzzle Dick joined the party, and the news which had\ncaused such a convulsion among the ancient musicians was unfolded to him.\n\"Well,\" he said, blushing at the allusion to Miss Day, \"I know by some\nwords of hers that she has a particular wish not to play, because she is\na friend of ours; and how the alteration comes, I don't know.\"\n\n\"Now, this is my plan,\" said the tranter, reviving the spirit of the\ndiscussion by the infusion of new ideas, as was his custom--\"this is my\nplan; if you don't like it, no harm's done.  We all know one another very\nwell, don't we, neighbours?\"\n\nThat they knew one another very well was received as a statement which,\nthough familiar, should not be omitted in introductory speeches.\n\n\"Then I say this\"--and the tranter in his emphasis slapped down his hand\non Mr. Spinks's shoulder with a momentum of several pounds, upon which\nMr. Spinks tried to look not in the least startled--\"I say that we all\nmove down-along straight as a line to Pa'son Mayble's when the clock has\ngone six to-morrow night.  There we one and all stand in the passage,\nthen one or two of us go in and spak to en, man and man; and say, 'Pa'son\nMayble, every tradesman d'like to have his own way in his workshop, and\nMellstock Church is yours.  Instead of turning us out neck and crop, let\nus stay on till Christmas, and we'll gie way to the young woman, Mr.\nMayble, and make no more ado about it.  And we shall always be quite\nwilling to touch our hats when we meet ye, Mr. Mayble, just as before.'\nThat sounds very well?  Hey?\"\n\n\"Proper well, in faith, Reuben Dewy.\"\n\n\"And we won't sit down in his house; 'twould be looking too familiar when\nonly just reconciled?\"\n\n\"No need at all to sit down.  Just do our duty man and man, turn round,\nand march out--he'll think all the more of us for it.\"\n\n\"I hardly think Leaf had better go wi' us?\" said Michael, turning to Leaf\nand taking his measure from top to bottom by the eye.  \"He's so terrible\nsilly that he might ruin the concern.\"\n\n\"He don't want to go much; do ye, Thomas Leaf?\" said William.\n\n\"Hee-hee! no; I don't want to.  Only a teeny bit!\"\n\n\"I be mortal afeard, Leaf, that you'll never be able to tell how many\ncuts d'take to sharpen a spar,\" said Mail.\n\n\"I never had no head, never! that's how it happened to happen, hee-hee!\"\n\nThey all assented to this, not with any sense of humiliating Leaf by\ndisparaging him after an open confession, but because it was an accepted\nthing that Leaf didn't in the least mind having no head, that deficiency\nof his being an unimpassioned matter of parish history.\n\n\"But I can sing my treble!\" continued Thomas Leaf, quite delighted at\nbeing called a fool in such a friendly way; \"I can sing my treble as well\nas any maid, or married woman either, and better!  And if Jim had lived,\nI should have had a clever brother!  To-morrow is poor Jim's birthday.\nHe'd ha' been twenty-six if he'd lived till to-morrow.\"\n\n\"You always seem very sorry for Jim,\" said old William musingly.\n\n\"Ah!  I do.  Such a stay to mother as he'd always ha' been!  She'd never\nhave had to work in her old age if he had continued strong, poor Jim!\"\n\n\"What was his age when 'a died?\"\n\n\"Four hours and twenty minutes, poor Jim.  'A was born as might be at\nnight; and 'a didn't last as might be till the morning.  No, 'a didn't\nlast.  Mother called en Jim on the day that would ha' been his\nchristening day if he had lived; and she's always thinking about en.  You\nsee he died so very young.\"\n\n\"Well, 'twas rather youthful,\" said Michael.\n\n\"Now to my mind that woman is very romantical on the matter o' children?\"\nsaid the tranter, his eye sweeping his audience.\n\n\"Ah, well she mid be,\" said Leaf.  \"She had twelve regular one after\nanother, and they all, except myself, died very young; either before they\nwas born or just afterwards.\"\n\n\"Pore feller, too.  I suppose th'st want to come wi' us?\" the tranter\nmurmured.\n\n\"Well, Leaf, you shall come wi' us as yours is such a melancholy family,\"\nsaid old William rather sadly.\n\n\"I never see such a melancholy family as that afore in my life,\" said\nReuben.  \"There's Leaf's mother, poor woman!  Every morning I see her\neyes mooning out through the panes of glass like a pot-sick\nwinder-flower; and as Leaf sings a very high treble, and we don't know\nwhat we should do without en for upper G, we'll let en come as a trate,\npoor feller.\"\n\n\"Ay, we'll let en come, 'a b'lieve,\" said Mr. Penny, looking up, as the\npull happened to be at that moment.\n\n\"Now,\" continued the tranter, dispersing by a new tone of voice these\ndigressions about Leaf; \"as to going to see the pa'son, one of us might\ncall and ask en his meaning, and 'twould be just as well done; but it\nwill add a bit of flourish to the cause if the quire waits on him as a\nbody.  Then the great thing to mind is, not for any of our fellers to be\nnervous; so before starting we'll one and all come to my house and have a\nrasher of bacon; then every man-jack het a pint of cider into his inside;\nthen we'll warm up an extra drop wi' some mead and a bit of ginger; every\none take a thimbleful--just a glimmer of a drop, mind ye, no more, to\nfinish off his inner man--and march off to Pa'son Mayble.  Why, sonnies,\na man's not himself till he is fortified wi' a bit and a drop?  We shall\nbe able to look any gentleman in the face then without shrink or shame.\"\n\nMail recovered from a deep meditation and downward glance into the earth\nin time to give a cordial approval to this line of action, and the\nmeeting adjourned.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV: THE INTERVIEW WITH THE VICAR\n\n\nAt six o'clock the next day, the whole body of men in the choir emerged\nfrom the tranter's door, and advanced with a firm step down the lane.\nThis dignity of march gradually became obliterated as they went on, and\nby the time they reached the hill behind the vicarage a faint resemblance\nto a flock of sheep might have been discerned in the venerable party.  A\nword from the tranter, however, set them right again; and as they\ndescended the hill, the regular tramp, tramp, tramp of the united feet\nwas clearly audible from the vicarage garden.  At the opening of the gate\nthere was another short interval of irregular shuffling, caused by a\nrather peculiar habit the gate had, when swung open quickly, of striking\nagainst the bank and slamming back into the opener's face.\n\n\"Now keep step again, will ye?\" said the tranter.  \"It looks better, and\nmore becomes the high class of arrant which has brought us here.\"  Thus\nthey advanced to the door.\n\nAt Reuben's ring the more modest of the group turned aside, adjusted\ntheir hats, and looked critically at any shrub that happened to lie in\nthe line of vision; endeavouring thus to give a person who chanced to\nlook out of the windows the impression that their request, whatever it\nwas going to be, was rather a casual thought occurring whilst they were\ninspecting the vicar's shrubbery and grass-plot than a predetermined\nthing.  The tranter, who, coming frequently to the vicarage with luggage,\ncoals, firewood, etc., had none of the awe for its precincts that filled\nthe breasts of most of the others, fixed his eyes firmly on the knocker\nduring this interval of waiting.  The knocker having no characteristic\nworthy of notice, he relinquished it for a knot in one of the\ndoor-panels, and studied the winding lines of the grain.\n\n\"O, sir, please, here's Tranter Dewy, and old William Dewy, and young\nRichard Dewy, O, and all the quire too, sir, except the boys, a-come to\nsee you!\" said Mr. Maybold's maid-servant to Mr. Maybold, the pupils of\nher eyes dilating like circles in a pond.\n\n\"All the choir?\" said the astonished vicar (who may be shortly described\nas a good-looking young man with courageous eyes, timid mouth, and\nneutral nose), abandoning his writing and looking at his parlour-maid\nafter speaking, like a man who fancied he had seen her face before but\ncouldn't recollect where.\n\n\"And they looks very firm, and Tranter Dewy do turn neither to the right\nhand nor to the left, but stares quite straight and solemn with his mind\nmade up!\"\n\n\"O, all the choir,\" repeated the vicar to himself, trying by that simple\ndevice to trot out his thoughts on what the choir could come for.\n\n\"Yes; every man-jack of 'em, as I be alive!\"  (The parlour-maid was\nrather local in manner, having in fact been raised in the same village.)\n\"Really, sir, 'tis thoughted by many in town and country that--\"\n\n\"Town and country!--Heavens, I had no idea that I was public property in\nthis way!\" said the vicar, his face acquiring a hue somewhere between\nthat of the rose and the peony.  \"Well, 'It is thought in town and\ncountry that--'\"\n\n\"It is thought that you be going to get it hot and strong!--excusen my\nincivility, sir.\"\n\nThe vicar suddenly recalled to his recollection that he had long ago\nsettled it to be decidedly a mistake to encourage his servant Jane in\ngiving personal opinions.  The servant Jane saw by the vicar's face that\nhe recalled this fact to his mind; and removing her forehead from the\nedge of the door, and rubbing away the indent that edge had made,\nvanished into the passage as Mr. Maybold remarked, \"Show them in, Jane.\"\n\nA few minutes later a shuffling and jostling (reduced to as refined a\nform as was compatible with the nature of shuffles and jostles) was heard\nin the passage; then an earnest and prolonged wiping of shoes, conveying\nthe notion that volumes of mud had to be removed; but the roads being so\nclean that not a particle of dirt appeared on the choir's boots (those of\nall the elder members being newly oiled, and Dick's brightly polished),\nthis wiping might have been set down simply as a desire to show that\nrespectable men had no wish to take a mean advantage of clean roads for\ncurtailing proper ceremonies.  Next there came a powerful whisper from\nthe same quarter:-\n\n\"Now stand stock-still there, my sonnies, one and all!  And don't make no\nnoise; and keep your backs close to the wall, that company may pass in\nand out easy if they want to without squeezing through ye: and we two are\nenough to go in.\" . . . The voice was the tranter's.\n\n\"I wish I could go in too and see the sight!\" said a reedy voice--that of\nLeaf.\n\n\"'Tis a pity Leaf is so terrible silly, or else he might,\" said another.\n\n\"I never in my life seed a quire go into a study to have it out about the\nplaying and singing,\" pleaded Leaf; \"and I should like to see it just\nonce!\"\n\n\"Very well; we'll let en come in,\" said the tranter.  \"You'll be like\nchips in porridge, {1} Leaf--neither good nor hurt.  All right, my sonny,\ncome along;\" and immediately himself, old William, and Leaf appeared in\nthe room.\n\n\"We took the liberty to come and see 'ee, sir,\" said Reuben, letting his\nhat hang in his left hand, and touching with his right the brim of an\nimaginary one on his head.  \"We've come to see 'ee, sir, man and man, and\nno offence, I hope?\"\n\n\"None at all,\" said Mr. Maybold.\n\n\"This old aged man standing by my side is father; William Dewy by name,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Yes; I see it is,\" said the vicar, nodding aside to old William, who\nsmiled.\n\n\"I thought you mightn't know en without his bass-viol,\" the tranter\napologized.  \"You see, he always wears his best clothes and his bass-viol\na-Sundays, and it do make such a difference in a' old man's look.\"\n\n\"And who's that young man?\" the vicar said.\n\n\"Tell the pa'son yer name,\" said the tranter, turning to Leaf, who stood\nwith his elbows nailed back to a bookcase.\n\n\"Please, Thomas Leaf, your holiness!\" said Leaf, trembling.\n\n\"I hope you'll excuse his looks being so very thin,\" continued the\ntranter deprecatingly, turning to the vicar again.  \"But 'tisn't his\nfault, poor feller.  He's rather silly by nature, and could never get\nfat; though he's a' excellent treble, and so we keep him on.\"\n\n\"I never had no head, sir,\" said Leaf, eagerly grasping at this\nopportunity for being forgiven his existence.\n\n\"Ah, poor young man!\" said Mr. Maybold.\n\n\"Bless you, he don't mind it a bit, if you don't, sir,\" said the tranter\nassuringly.  \"Do ye, Leaf?\"\n\n\"Not I--not a morsel--hee, hee!  I was afeard it mightn't please your\nholiness, sir, that's all.\"\n\nThe tranter, finding Leaf get on so very well through his negative\nqualities, was tempted in a fit of generosity to advance him still\nhigher, by giving him credit for positive ones.  \"He's very clever for a\nsilly chap, good-now, sir.  You never knowed a young feller keep his\nsmock-frocks so clane; very honest too.  His ghastly looks is all there\nis against en, poor feller; but we can't help our looks, you know, sir.\"\n\n\"True: we cannot.  You live with your mother, I think, Leaf?\"\n\nThe tranter looked at Leaf to express that the most friendly assistant to\nhis tongue could do no more for him now, and that he must be left to his\nown resources.\n\n\"Yes, sir: a widder, sir.  Ah, if brother Jim had lived she'd have had a\nclever son to keep her without work!\"\n\n\"Indeed! poor woman.  Give her this half-crown.  I'll call and see your\nmother.\"\n\n\"Say, 'Thank you, sir,'\" the tranter whispered imperatively towards Leaf.\n\n\"Thank you, sir!\" said Leaf.\n\n\"That's it, then; sit down, Leaf,\" said Mr. Maybold.\n\n\"Y-yes, sir!\"\n\nThe tranter cleared his throat after this accidental parenthesis about\nLeaf, rectified his bodily position, and began his speech.\n\n\"Mr. Mayble,\" he said, \"I hope you'll excuse my common way, but I always\nlike to look things in the face.\"\n\nReuben made a point of fixing this sentence in the vicar's mind by gazing\nhard at him at the conclusion of it, and then out of the window.\n\nMr. Maybold and old William looked in the same direction, apparently\nunder the impression that the things' faces alluded to were there\nvisible.\n\n\"What I have been thinking\"--the tranter implied by this use of the past\ntense that he was hardly so discourteous as to be positively thinking it\nthen--\"is that the quire ought to be gie'd a little time, and not done\naway wi' till Christmas, as a fair thing between man and man.  And, Mr.\nMayble, I hope you'll excuse my common way?\"\n\n\"I will, I will.  Till Christmas,\" the vicar murmured, stretching the two\nwords to a great length, as if the distance to Christmas might be\nmeasured in that way.  \"Well, I want you all to understand that I have no\npersonal fault to find, and that I don't wish to change the church music\nby forcible means, or in a way which should hurt the feelings of any\nparishioners.  Why I have at last spoken definitely on the subject is\nthat a player has been brought under--I may say pressed upon--my notice\nseveral times by one of the churchwardens.  And as the organ I brought\nwith me is here waiting\" (pointing to a cabinet-organ standing in the\nstudy), \"there is no reason for longer delay.\"\n\n\"We made a mistake I suppose then, sir?  But we understood the young\nwoman didn't want to play particularly?\"  The tranter arranged his\ncountenance to signify that he did not want to be inquisitive in the\nleast.\n\n\"No, nor did she.  Nor did I definitely wish her to just yet; for your\nplaying is very good.  But, as I said, one of the churchwardens has been\nso anxious for a change, that, as matters stand, I couldn't consistently\nrefuse my consent.\"\n\nNow for some reason or other, the vicar at this point seemed to have an\nidea that he had prevaricated; and as an honest vicar, it was a thing he\ndetermined not to do.  He corrected himself, blushing as he did so,\nthough why he should blush was not known to Reuben.\n\n\"Understand me rightly,\" he said: \"the church-warden proposed it to me,\nbut I had thought myself of getting--Miss Day to play.\"\n\n\"Which churchwarden might that be who proposed her, sir?--excusing my\ncommon way.\"  The tranter intimated by his tone that, so far from being\ninquisitive, he did not even wish to ask a single question.\n\n\"Mr. Shiner, I believe.\"\n\n\"Clk, my sonny!--beg your pardon, sir, that's only a form of words of\nmine, and slipped out accidental--he nourishes enmity against us for some\nreason or another; perhaps because we played rather hard upon en\nChristmas night.  Anyhow 'tis certain sure that Mr. Shiner's real love\nfor music of a particular kind isn't his reason.  He've no more ear than\nthat chair.  But let that be.\"\n\n\"I don't think you should conclude that, because Mr. Shiner wants a\ndifferent music, he has any ill-feeling for you.  I myself, I must own,\nprefer organ-music to any other.  I consider it most proper, and feel\njustified in endeavouring to introduce it; but then, although other music\nis better, I don't say yours is not good.\"\n\n\"Well then, Mr. Mayble, since death's to be, we'll die like men any day\nyou name (excusing my common way).\"\n\nMr. Maybold bowed his head.\n\n\"All we thought was, that for us old ancient singers to be choked off\nquiet at no time in particular, as now, in the Sundays after Easter,\nwould seem rather mean in the eyes of other parishes, sir.  But if we\nfell glorious with a bit of a flourish at Christmas, we should have a\nrespectable end, and not dwindle away at some nameless paltry\nsecond-Sunday-after or Sunday-next-before something, that's got no name\nof his own.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that's reasonable; I own it's reasonable.\"\n\n\"You see, Mr. Mayble, we've got--do I keep you inconvenient long, sir?\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"We've got our feelings--father there especially.\"\n\nThe tranter, in his earnestness, had advanced his person to within six\ninches of the vicar's.\n\n\"Certainly, certainly!\" said Mr. Maybold, retreating a little for\nconvenience of seeing.  \"You are all enthusiastic on the subject, and I\nam all the more gratified to find you so.  A Laodicean lukewarmness is\nworse than wrongheadedness itself.\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir.  In fact now, Mr. Mayble,\" Reuben continued, more\nimpressively, and advancing a little closer still to the vicar, \"father\nthere is a perfect figure o' wonder, in the way of being fond of music!\"\n\nThe vicar drew back a little further, the tranter suddenly also standing\nback a foot or two, to throw open the view of his father, and pointing to\nhim at the same time.\n\nOld William moved uneasily in the large chair, and with a minute smile on\nthe mere edge of his lips, for good-manners, said he was indeed very fond\nof tunes.\n\n\"Now, you see exactly how it is,\" Reuben continued, appealing to Mr.\nMaybold's sense of justice by looking sideways into his eyes.  The vicar\nseemed to see how it was so well that the gratified tranter walked up to\nhim again with even vehement eagerness, so that his waistcoat-buttons\nalmost rubbed against the vicar's as he continued: \"As to father, if you\nor I, or any man or woman of the present generation, at the time music is\na-playing, was to shake your fist in father's face, as may be this way,\nand say, 'Don't you be delighted with that music!'\"--the tranter went\nback to where Leaf was sitting, and held his fist so close to Leaf's face\nthat the latter pressed his head back against the wall: \"All right, Leaf,\nmy sonny, I won't hurt you; 'tis just to show my meaning to Mr.\nMayble.--As I was saying, if you or I, or any man, was to shake your fist\nin father's face this way, and say, 'William, your life or your music!'\nhe'd say, 'My life!'  Now that's father's nature all over; and you see,\nsir, it must hurt the feelings of a man of that kind for him and his bass-\nviol to be done away wi' neck and crop.\"\n\nThe tranter went back to the vicar's front and again looked earnestly at\nhis face.\n\n\"True, true, Dewy,\" Mr. Maybold answered, trying to withdraw his head and\nshoulders without moving his feet; but finding this impracticable, edging\nback another inch.  These frequent retreats had at last jammed Mr.\nMaybold between his easy-chair and the edge of the table.\n\nAnd at the moment of the announcement of the choir, Mr. Maybold had just\nre-dipped the pen he was using; at their entry, instead of wiping it, he\nhad laid it on the table with the nib overhanging.  At the last retreat\nhis coat-tails came in contact with the pen, and down it rolled, first\nagainst the back of the chair, thence turning a summersault into the\nseat, thence falling to the floor with a rattle.\n\nThe vicar stooped for his pen, and the tranter, wishing to show that,\nhowever great their ecclesiastical differences, his mind was not so small\nas to let this affect his social feelings, stooped also.\n\n\"And have you anything else you want to explain to me, Dewy?\" said Mr.\nMaybold from under the table.\n\n\"Nothing, sir.  And, Mr. Mayble, you be not offended?  I hope you see our\ndesire is reason?\" said the tranter from under the chair.\n\n\"Quite, quite; and I shouldn't think of refusing to listen to such a\nreasonable request,\" the vicar replied.  Seeing that Reuben had secured\nthe pen, he resumed his vertical position, and added, \"You know, Dewy, it\nis often said how difficult a matter it is to act up to our convictions\nand please all parties.  It may be said with equal truth, that it is\ndifficult for a man of any appreciativeness to have convictions at all.\nNow in my case, I see right in you, and right in Shiner.  I see that\nviolins are good, and that an organ is good; and when we introduce the\norgan, it will not be that fiddles were bad, but that an organ was\nbetter.  That you'll clearly understand, Dewy?\"\n\n\"I will; and thank you very much for such feelings, sir.  Piph-h-h-h!  How\nthe blood do get into my head, to be sure, whenever I quat down like\nthat!\" said Reuben, who having also risen to his feet stuck the pen\nvertically in the inkstand and almost through the bottom, that it might\nnot roll down again under any circumstances whatever.\n\nNow the ancient body of minstrels in the passage felt their curiosity\nsurging higher and higher as the minutes passed.  Dick, not having much\naffection for this errand, soon grew tired, and went away in the\ndirection of the school.  Yet their sense of propriety would probably\nhave restrained them from any attempt to discover what was going on in\nthe study had not the vicar's pen fallen to the floor.  The conviction\nthat the movement of chairs, etc., necessitated by the search, could only\nhave been caused by the catastrophe of a bloody fight beginning,\noverpowered all other considerations; and they advanced to the door,\nwhich had only just fallen to.  Thus, when Mr. Maybold raised his eyes\nafter the stooping he beheld glaring through the door Mr. Penny in full-\nlength portraiture, Mail's face and shoulders above Mr. Penny's head,\nSpinks's forehead and eyes over Mail's crown, and a fractional part of\nBowman's countenance under Spinks's arm--crescent-shaped portions of\nother heads and faces being visible behind these--the whole dozen and odd\neyes bristling with eager inquiry.\n\nMr. Penny, as is the case with excitable boot-makers and men, seeing the\nvicar look at him and hearing no word spoken, thought it incumbent upon\nhimself to say something of any kind.  Nothing suggested itself till he\nhad looked for about half a minute at the vicar.\n\n\"You'll excuse my naming of it, sir,\" he said, regarding with much\ncommiseration the mere surface of the vicar's face; \"but perhaps you\ndon't know that your chin have bust out a-bleeding where you cut yourself\na-shaving this morning, sir.\"\n\n\"Now, that was the stooping, depend upon't,\" the tranter suggested, also\nlooking with much interest at the vicar's chin.  \"Blood always will bust\nout again if you hang down the member that's been bleeding.\"\n\nOld William raised his eyes and watched the vicar's bleeding chin\nlikewise; and Leaf advanced two or three paces from the bookcase,\nabsorbed in the contemplation of the same phenomenon, with parted lips\nand delighted eyes.\n\n\"Dear me, dear me!\" said Mr. Maybold hastily, looking very red, and\nbrushing his chin with his hand, then taking out his handkerchief and\nwiping the place.\n\n\"That's it, sir; all right again now, 'a b'lieve--a mere nothing,\" said\nMr. Penny.  \"A little bit of fur off your hat will stop it in a minute if\nit should bust out again.\"\n\n\"I'll let 'ee have a bit off mine,\" said Reuben, to show his good\nfeeling; \"my hat isn't so new as yours, sir, and 'twon't hurt mine a\nbit.\"\n\n\"No, no; thank you, thank you,\" Mr. Maybold again nervously replied.\n\n\"'Twas rather a deep cut seemingly?\" said Reuben, feeling these to be the\nkindest and best remarks he could make.\n\n\"O, no; not particularly.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, your hand will shake sometimes a-shaving, and just when it\ncomes into your head that you may cut yourself, there's the blood.\"\n\n\"I have been revolving in my mind that question of the time at which we\nmake the change,\" said Mr. Maybold, \"and I know you'll meet me half-way.\nI think Christmas-day as much too late for me as the present time is too\nearly for you.  I suggest Michaelmas or thereabout as a convenient time\nfor both parties; for I think your objection to a Sunday which has no\nname is not one of any real weight.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.  I suppose mortal men mustn't expect their own way\nentirely; and I express in all our names that we'll make shift and be\nsatisfied with what you say.\"  The tranter touched the brim of his\nimaginary hat again, and all the choir did the same.  \"About Michaelmas,\nthen, as far as you are concerned, sir, and then we make room for the\nnext generation.\"\n\n\"About Michaelmas,\" said the vicar.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V: RETURNING HOME WARD\n\n\n\"'A took it very well, then?\" said Mail, as they all walked up the hill.\n\n\"He behaved like a man, 'a did so,\" said the tranter.  \"And I'm glad\nwe've let en know our minds.  And though, beyond that, we ha'n't got much\nby going, 'twas worth while.  He won't forget it.  Yes, he took it very\nwell.  Supposing this tree here was Pa'son Mayble, and I standing here,\nand thik gr't stone is father sitting in the easy-chair.  'Dewy,' says\nhe, 'I don't wish to change the church music in a forcible way.'\"\n\n\"That was very nice o' the man, even though words be wind.\"\n\n\"Proper nice--out and out nice.  The fact is,\" said Reuben\nconfidentially, \"'tis how you take a man.  Everybody must be managed.\nQueens must be managed: kings must be managed; for men want managing\nalmost as much as women, and that's saying a good deal.\"\n\n\"'Tis truly!\" murmured the husbands.\n\n\"Pa'son Mayble and I were as good friends all through it as if we'd been\nsworn brothers.  Ay, the man's well enough; 'tis what's put in his head\nthat spoils him, and that's why we've got to go.\"\n\n\"There's really no believing half you hear about people nowadays.\"\n\n\"Bless ye, my sonnies! 'tisn't the pa'son's move at all.  That gentleman\nover there\" (the tranter nodded in the direction of Shiner's farm) \"is at\nthe root of the mischty.\"\n\n\"What!  Shiner?\"\n\n\"Ay; and I see what the pa'son don't see.  Why, Shiner is for putting\nforward that young woman that only last night I was saying was our Dick's\nsweet-heart, but I suppose can't be, and making much of her in the sight\nof the congregation, and thinking he'll win her by showing her off.  Well,\nperhaps 'a woll.\"\n\n\"Then the music is second to the woman, the other churchwarden is second\nto Shiner, the pa'son is second to the churchwardens, and God A'mighty is\nnowhere at all.\"\n\n\"That's true; and you see,\" continued Reuben, \"at the very beginning it\nput me in a stud as to how to quarrel wi' en.  In short, to save my soul,\nI couldn't quarrel wi' such a civil man without belying my conscience.\nSays he to father there, in a voice as quiet as a lamb's, 'William, you\nare a' old aged man, as all shall be, so sit down in my easy-chair, and\nrest yourself.'  And down father zot.  I could fain ha' laughed at thee,\nfather; for thou'st take it so unconcerned at first, and then looked so\nfrightened when the chair-bottom sunk in.\"\n\n\"You see,\" said old William, hastening to explain, \"I was scared to find\nthe bottom gie way--what should I know o' spring bottoms?--and thought I\nhad broke it down: and of course as to breaking down a man's chair, I\ndidn't wish any such thing.\"\n\n\"And, neighbours, when a feller, ever so much up for a miff, d'see his\nown father sitting in his enemy's easy-chair, and a poor chap like Leaf\nmade the best of, as if he almost had brains--why, it knocks all the wind\nout of his sail at once: it did out of mine.\"\n\n\"If that young figure of fun--Fance Day, I mean,\" said Bowman, \"hadn't\nbeen so mighty forward wi' showing herself off to Shiner and Dick and the\nrest, 'tis my belief we should never ha' left the gallery.\"\n\n\"'Tis my belief that though Shiner fired the bullets, the parson made\n'em,\" said Mr. Penny.  \"My wife sticks to it that he's in love wi' her.\"\n\n\"That's a thing we shall never know.  I can't onriddle her, nohow.\"\n\n\"Thou'st ought to be able to onriddle such a little chiel as she,\" the\ntranter observed.\n\n\"The littler the maid, the bigger the riddle, to my mind.  And coming of\nsuch a stock, too, she may well be a twister.\"\n\n\"Yes; Geoffrey Day is a clever man if ever there was one.  Never says\nanything: not he.\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"You might live wi' that man, my sonnies, a hundred years, and never know\nthere was anything in him.\"\n\n\"Ay; one o' these up-country London ink-bottle chaps would call Geoffrey\na fool.\"\n\n\"Ye never find out what's in that man: never,\" said Spinks.  \"Close? ah,\nhe is close!  He can hold his tongue well.  That man's dumbness is\nwonderful to listen to.\"\n\n\"There's so much sense in it.  Every moment of it is brimmen over wi'\nsound understanding.\"\n\n\"'A can hold his tongue very clever--very clever truly,\" echoed Leaf.  \"'A\ndo look at me as if 'a could see my thoughts running round like the works\nof a clock.\"\n\n\"Well, all will agree that the man can halt well in his talk, be it a\nlong time or be it a short time.  And though we can't expect his daughter\nto inherit his closeness, she may have a few dribblets from his sense.\"\n\n\"And his pocket, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Yes; the nine hundred pound that everybody says he's worth; but I call\nit four hundred and fifty; for I never believe more than half I hear.\"\n\n\"Well, he've made a pound or two, and I suppose the maid will have it,\nsince there's nobody else.  But 'tis rather sharp upon her, if she's been\nborn to fortune, to bring her up as if not born for it, and letting her\nwork so hard.\"\n\n\"'Tis all upon his principle.  A long-headed feller!\"\n\n\"Ah,\" murmured Spinks, \"'twould be sharper upon her if she were born for\nfortune, and not to it!  I suffer from that affliction.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI: YALBURY WOOD AND THE KEEPER'S HOUSE\n\n\nA mood of blitheness rarely experienced even by young men was Dick's on\nthe following Monday morning.  It was the week after the Easter holidays,\nand he was journeying along with Smart the mare and the light\nspring-cart, watching the damp slopes of the hill-sides as they streamed\nin the warmth of the sun, which at this unsettled season shone on the\ngrass with the freshness of an occasional inspector rather than as an\naccustomed proprietor.  His errand was to fetch Fancy, and some\nadditional household goods, from her father's house in the neighbouring\nparish to her dwelling at Mellstock.  The distant view was darkly shaded\nwith clouds; but the nearer parts of the landscape were whitely illumined\nby the visible rays of the sun streaming down across the heavy gray shade\nbehind.\n\nThe tranter had not yet told his son of the state of Shiner's heart that\nhad been suggested to him by Shiner's movements.  He preferred to let\nsuch delicate affairs right themselves; experience having taught him that\nthe uncertain phenomenon of love, as it existed in other people, was not\na groundwork upon which a single action of his own life could be founded.\n\nGeoffrey Day lived in the depths of Yalbury Wood, which formed portion of\none of the outlying estates of the Earl of Wessex, to whom Day was head\ngame-keeper, timber-steward, and general overlooker for this district.\nThe wood was intersected by the highway from Casterbridge to London at a\nplace not far from the house, and some trees had of late years been\nfelled between its windows and the ascent of Yalbury Hill, to give the\nsolitary cottager a glimpse of the passers-by.\n\nIt was a satisfaction to walk into the keeper's house, even as a\nstranger, on a fine spring morning like the present.  A curl of\nwood-smoke came from the chimney, and drooped over the roof like a blue\nfeather in a lady's hat; and the sun shone obliquely upon the patch of\ngrass in front, which reflected its brightness through the open doorway\nand up the staircase opposite, lighting up each riser with a shiny green\nradiance, and leaving the top of each step in shade.\n\nThe window-sill of the front room was between four and five feet from the\nfloor, dropping inwardly to a broad low bench, over which, as well as\nover the whole surface of the wall beneath, there always hung a deep\nshade, which was considered objectionable on every ground save one,\nnamely, that the perpetual sprinkling of seeds and water by the caged\ncanary above was not noticed as an eyesore by visitors.  The window was\nset with thickly-leaded diamond glazing, formed, especially in the lower\npanes, of knotty glass of various shades of green.  Nothing was better\nknown to Fancy than the extravagant manner in which these circular knots\nor eyes distorted everything seen through them from the outside--lifting\nhats from heads, shoulders from bodies; scattering the spokes of cart-\nwheels, and bending the straight fir-trunks into semicircles.  The\nceiling was carried by a beam traversing its midst, from the side of\nwhich projected a large nail, used solely and constantly as a peg for\nGeoffrey's hat; the nail was arched by a rainbow-shaped stain, imprinted\nby the brim of the said hat when it was hung there dripping wet.\n\nThe most striking point about the room was the furniture.  This was a\nrepetition upon inanimate objects of the old principle introduced by\nNoah, consisting for the most part of two articles of every sort.  The\nduplicate system of furnishing owed its existence to the forethought of\nFancy's mother, exercised from the date of Fancy's birthday onwards.  The\narrangement spoke for itself: nobody who knew the tone of the household\ncould look at the goods without being aware that the second set was a\nprovision for Fancy, when she should marry and have a house of her own.\nThe most noticeable instance was a pair of green-faced eight-day clocks,\nticking alternately, which were severally two and half minutes and three\nminutes striking the hour of twelve, one proclaiming, in Italian\nflourishes, Thomas Wood as the name of its maker, and the other--arched\nat the top, and altogether of more cynical appearance--that of Ezekiel\nSaunders.  They were two departed clockmakers of Casterbridge, whose\ndesperate rivalry throughout their lives was nowhere more emphatically\nperpetuated than here at Geoffrey's.  These chief specimens of the\nmarriage provision were supported on the right by a couple of kitchen\ndressers, each fitted complete with their cups, dishes, and plates, in\ntheir turn followed by two dumb-waiters, two family Bibles, two warming-\npans, and two intermixed sets of chairs.\n\nBut the position last reached--the chimney-corner--was, after all, the\nmost attractive side of the parallelogram.  It was large enough to admit,\nin addition to Geoffrey himself, Geoffrey's wife, her chair, and her work-\ntable, entirely within the line of the mantel, without danger or even\ninconvenience from the heat of the fire; and was spacious enough overhead\nto allow of the insertion of wood poles for the hanging of bacon, which\nwere cloaked with long shreds of soot, floating on the draught like the\ntattered banners on the walls of ancient aisles.\n\nThese points were common to most chimney corners of the neighbourhood;\nbut one feature there was which made Geoffrey's fireside not only an\nobject of interest to casual aristocratic visitors--to whom every cottage\nfireside was more or less a curiosity--but the admiration of friends who\nwere accustomed to fireplaces of the ordinary hamlet model.  This\npeculiarity was a little window in the chimney-back, almost over the\nfire, around which the smoke crept caressingly when it left the\nperpendicular course.  The window-board was curiously stamped with black\ncircles, burnt thereon by the heated bottoms of drinking-cups, which had\nrested there after previously standing on the hot ashes of the hearth for\nthe purpose of warming their contents, the result giving to the ledge the\nlook of an envelope which has passed through innumerable post-offices.\n\nFancy was gliding about the room preparing dinner, her head inclining now\nto the right, now to the left, and singing the tips and ends of tunes\nthat sprang up in her mind like mushrooms.  The footsteps of Mrs. Day\ncould be heard in the room overhead.  Fancy went finally to the door.\n\n\"Father!  Dinner.\"\n\nA tall spare figure was seen advancing by the window with periodical\nsteps, and the keeper entered from the garden.  He appeared to be a man\nwho was always looking down, as if trying to recollect something he said\nyesterday.  The surface of his face was fissured rather than wrinkled,\nand over and under his eyes were folds which seemed as a kind of exterior\neyelids.  His nose had been thrown backwards by a blow in a poaching\nfray, so that when the sun was low and shining in his face, people could\nsee far into his head.  There was in him a quiet grimness, which would in\nhis moments of displeasure have become surliness, had it not been\ntempered by honesty of soul, and which was often wrongheadedness because\nnot allied with subtlety.\n\nAlthough not an extraordinarily taciturn man among friends slightly\nricher than himself, he never wasted words upon outsiders, and to his\ntrapper Enoch his ideas were seldom conveyed by any other means than nods\nand shakes of the head.  Their long acquaintance with each other's ways,\nand the nature of their labours, rendered words between them almost\nsuperfluous as vehicles of thought, whilst the coincidence of their\nhorizons, and the astonishing equality of their social views, by\nstartling the keeper from time to time as very damaging to the theory of\nmaster and man, strictly forbade any indulgence in words as courtesies.\n\nBehind the keeper came Enoch (who had been assisting in the garden) at\nthe well-considered chronological distance of three minutes--an interval\nof non-appearance on the trapper's part not arrived at without some\nreflection.  Four minutes had been found to express indifference to\nindoor arrangements, and simultaneousness had implied too great an\nanxiety about meals.\n\n\"A little earlier than usual, Fancy,\" the keeper said, as he sat down and\nlooked at the clocks.  \"That Ezekiel Saunders o' thine is tearing on\nafore Thomas Wood again.\"\n\n\"I kept in the middle between them,\" said Fancy, also looking at the two\nclocks.\n\n\"Better stick to Thomas,\" said her father.  \"There's a healthy beat in\nThomas that would lead a man to swear by en offhand.  He is as true as\nthe town time.  How is it your stap-mother isn't here?\"\n\nAs Fancy was about to reply, the rattle of wheels was heard, and \"Weh-\nhey, Smart!\" in Mr. Richard Dewy's voice rolled into the cottage from\nround the corner of the house.\n\n\"Hullo! there's Dewy's cart come for thee, Fancy--Dick driving--afore\ntime, too.  Well, ask the lad to have pot-luck with us.\"\n\nDick on entering made a point of implying by his general bearing that he\ntook an interest in Fancy simply as in one of the same race and country\nas himself; and they all sat down.  Dick could have wished her manner had\nnot been so entirely free from all apparent consciousness of those\naccidental meetings of theirs: but he let the thought pass.  Enoch sat\ndiagonally at a table afar off, under the corner cupboard, and drank his\ncider from a long perpendicular pint cup, having tall fir-trees done in\nbrown on its sides.  He threw occasional remarks into the general tide of\nconversation, and with this advantage to himself, that he participated in\nthe pleasures of a talk (slight as it was) at meal-times, without\nsaddling himself with the responsibility of sustaining it.\n\n\"Why don't your stap-mother come down, Fancy?\" said Geoffrey.  \"You'll\nexcuse her, Mister Dick, she's a little queer sometimes.\"\n\n\"O yes,--quite,\" said Richard, as if he were in the habit of excusing\npeople every day.\n\n\"She d'belong to that class of womankind that become second wives: a rum\nclass rather.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Dick, with sympathy for an indefinite something.\n\n\"Yes; and 'tis trying to a female, especially if you've been a first\nwife, as she hev.\"\n\n\"Very trying it must be.\"\n\n\"Yes: you see her first husband was a young man, who let her go too far;\nin fact, she used to kick up Bob's-a-dying at the least thing in the\nworld.  And when I'd married her and found it out, I thought, thinks I,\n''Tis too late now to begin to cure 'e;' and so I let her bide.  But\nshe's queer,--very queer, at times!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n\n\"Yes: there; wives be such a provoking class o' society, because though\nthey be never right, they be never more than half wrong.\"\n\nFancy seemed uneasy under the infliction of this household moralizing,\nwhich might tend to damage the airy-fairy nature that Dick, as maiden\nshrewdness told her, had accredited her with.  Her dead silence impressed\nGeoffrey with the notion that something in his words did not agree with\nher educated ideas, and he changed the conversation.\n\n\"Did Fred Shiner send the cask o' drink, Fancy?\"\n\n\"I think he did: O yes, he did.\"\n\n\"Nice solid feller, Fred Shiner!\" said Geoffrey to Dick as he helped\nhimself to gravy, bringing the spoon round to his plate by way of the\npotato-dish, to obviate a stain on the cloth in the event of a spill.\n\nNow Geoffrey's eyes had been fixed upon his plate for the previous four\nor five minutes, and in removing them he had only carried them to the\nspoon, which, from its fulness and the distance of its transit,\nnecessitated a steady watching through the whole of the route.  Just as\nintently as the keeper's eyes had been fixed on the spoon, Fancy's had\nbeen fixed on her father's, without premeditation or the slightest phase\nof furtiveness; but there they were fastened.  This was the reason why:\n\nDick was sitting next to her on the right side, and on the side of the\ntable opposite to her father.  Fancy had laid her right hand lightly down\nupon the table-cloth for an instant, and to her alarm Dick, after\ndropping his fork and brushing his forehead as a reason, flung down his\nown left hand, overlapping a third of Fancy's with it, and keeping it\nthere.  So the innocent Fancy, instead of pulling her hand from the trap,\nsettled her eyes on her father's, to guard against his discovery of this\nperilous game of Dick's.  Dick finished his mouthful; Fancy finished her\ncrumb, and nothing was done beyond watching Geoffrey's eyes.  Then the\nhands slid apart; Fancy's going over six inches of cloth, Dick's over\none.  Geoffrey's eye had risen.\n\n\"I said Fred Shiner is a nice solid feller,\" he repeated, more\nemphatically.\n\n\"He is; yes, he is,\" stammered Dick; \"but to me he is little more than a\nstranger.\"\n\n\"O, sure.  Now I know en as well as any man can be known.  And you know\nen very well too, don't ye, Fancy?\"\n\nGeoffrey put on a tone expressing that these words signified at present\nabout one hundred times the amount of meaning they conveyed literally.\n\nDick looked anxious.\n\n\"Will you pass me some bread?\" said Fancy in a flurry, the red of her\nface becoming slightly disordered, and looking as solicitous as a human\nbeing could look about a piece of bread.\n\n\"Ay, that I will,\" replied the unconscious Geoffrey.  \"Ay,\" he continued,\nreturning to the displaced idea, \"we are likely to remain friendly wi'\nMr. Shiner if the wheels d'run smooth.\"\n\n\"An excellent thing--a very capital thing, as I should say,\" the youth\nanswered with exceeding relevance, considering that his thoughts, instead\nof following Geoffrey's remark, were nestling at a distance of about two\nfeet on his left the whole time.\n\n\"A young woman's face will turn the north wind, Master Richard: my heart\nif 'twon't.\"  Dick looked more anxious and was attentive in earnest at\nthese words.  \"Yes; turn the north wind,\" added Geoffrey after an\nimpressive pause.  \"And though she's one of my own flesh and blood . . .\n\"\n\n\"Will you fetch down a bit of raw-mil' cheese from pantry-shelf?\" Fancy\ninterrupted, as if she were famishing.\n\n\"Ay, that I will, chiel; chiel, says I, and Mr. Shiner only asking last\nSaturday night . . . cheese you said, Fancy?\"\n\nDick controlled his emotion at these mysterious allusions to Mr.\nShiner,--the better enabled to do so by perceiving that Fancy's heart\nwent not with her father's--and spoke like a stranger to the affairs of\nthe neighbourhood.  \"Yes, there's a great deal to be said upon the power\nof maiden faces in settling your courses,\" he ventured, as the keeper\nretreated for the cheese.\n\n\"The conversation is taking a very strange turn: nothing that I have ever\ndone warrants such things being said!\" murmured Fancy with emphasis, just\nloud enough to reach Dick's ears.\n\n\"You think to yourself, 'twas to be,\" cried Enoch from his distant\ncorner, by way of filling up the vacancy caused by Geoffrey's momentary\nabsence.  \"And so you marry her, Master Dewy, and there's an end o't.\"\n\n\"Pray don't say such things, Enoch,\" came from Fancy severely, upon which\nEnoch relapsed into servitude.\n\n\"If we be doomed to marry, we marry; if we be doomed to remain single, we\ndo,\" replied Dick.\n\nGeoffrey had by this time sat down again, and he now made his lips thin\nby severely straining them across his gums, and looked out of the window\nalong the vista to the distant highway up Yalbury Hill.  \"That's not the\ncase with some folk,\" he said at length, as if he read the words on a\nboard at the further end of the vista.\n\nFancy looked interested, and Dick said, \"No?\"\n\n\"There's that wife o' mine.  It was her doom to be nobody's wife at all\nin the wide universe.  But she made up her mind that she would, and did\nit twice over.  Doom?  Doom is nothing beside a elderly woman--quite a\nchiel in her hands!\"\n\nA movement was now heard along the upstairs passage, and footsteps\ndescending.  The door at the foot of the stairs opened, and the second\nMrs. Day appeared in view, looking fixedly at the table as she advanced\ntowards it, with apparent obliviousness of the presence of any other\nhuman being than herself.  In short, if the table had been the\npersonages, and the persons the table, her glance would have been the\nmost natural imaginable.\n\nShe showed herself to possess an ordinary woman's face, iron-grey hair,\nhardly any hips, and a great deal of cleanliness in a broad white apron-\nstring, as it appeared upon the waist of her dark stuff dress.\n\n\"People will run away with a story now, I suppose,\" she began saying,\n\"that Jane Day's tablecloths are as poor and ragged as any union\nbeggar's!\"\n\nDick now perceived that the tablecloth was a little the worse for wear,\nand reflecting for a moment, concluded that 'people' in step-mother\nlanguage probably meant himself.  On lifting his eyes he found that Mrs.\nDay had vanished again upstairs, and presently returned with an armful of\nnew damask-linen tablecloths, folded square and hard as boards by long\ncompression.  These she flounced down into a chair; then took one, shook\nit out from its folds, and spread it on the table by instalments,\ntransferring the plates and dishes one by one from the old to the new\ncloth.\n\n\"And I suppose they'll say, too, that she ha'n't a decent knife and fork\nin her house!\"\n\n\"I shouldn't say any such ill-natured thing, I am sure--\" began Dick.  But\nMrs. Day had vanished into the next room.  Fancy appeared distressed.\n\n\"Very strange woman, isn't she?\" said Geoffrey, quietly going on with his\ndinner.  \"But 'tis too late to attempt curing.  My heart! 'tis so growed\ninto her that 'twould kill her to take it out.  Ay, she's very queer:\nyou'd be amazed to see what valuable goods we've got stowed away\nupstairs.\"\n\nBack again came Mrs. Day with a box of bright steel horn-handled knives,\nsilver-plated forks, carver, and all complete.  These were wiped of the\npreservative oil which coated them, and then a knife and fork were laid\ndown to each individual with a bang, the carving knife and fork thrust\ninto the meat dish, and the old ones they had hitherto used tossed away.\n\nGeoffrey placidly cut a slice with the new knife and fork, and asked Dick\nif he wanted any more.\n\nThe table had been spread for the mixed midday meal of dinner and tea,\nwhich was common among frugal countryfolk.  \"The parishioners about\nhere,\" continued Mrs. Day, not looking at any living being, but snatching\nup the brown delf tea-things, \"are the laziest, gossipest, poachest,\njailest set of any ever I came among.  And they'll talk about my teapot\nand tea-things next, I suppose!\"  She vanished with the teapot, cups, and\nsaucers, and reappeared with a tea-service in white china, and a packet\nwrapped in brown paper.  This was removed, together with folds of tissue-\npaper underneath; and a brilliant silver teapot appeared.\n\n\"I'll help to put the things right,\" said Fancy soothingly, and rising\nfrom her seat.  \"I ought to have laid out better things, I suppose.  But\"\n(here she enlarged her looks so as to include Dick) \"I have been away\nfrom home a good deal, and I make shocking blunders in my housekeeping.\"\nSmiles and suavity were then dispensed all around by this bright little\nbird.\n\nAfter a little more preparation and modification, Mrs. Day took her seat\nat the head of the table, and during the latter or tea division of the\nmeal, presided with much composure.  It may cause some surprise to learn\nthat, now her vagary was over, she showed herself to be an excellent\nperson with much common sense, and even a religious seriousness of tone\non matters pertaining to her afflictions.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII: DICK MAKES HIMSELF USEFUL\n\n\nThe effect of Geoffrey's incidental allusions to Mr. Shiner was to\nrestrain a considerable flow of spontaneous chat that would otherwise\nhave burst from young Dewy along the drive homeward.  And a certain\nremark he had hazarded to her, in rather too blunt and eager a manner,\nkept the young lady herself even more silent than Dick.  On both sides\nthere was an unwillingness to talk on any but the most trivial subjects,\nand their sentences rarely took a larger form than could be expressed in\ntwo or three words.\n\nOwing to Fancy being later in the day than she had promised, the\ncharwoman had given up expecting her; whereupon Dick could do no less\nthan stay and see her comfortably tided over the disagreeable time of\nentering and establishing herself in an empty house after an absence of a\nweek.  The additional furniture and utensils that had been brought (a\ncanary and cage among the rest) were taken out of the vehicle, and the\nhorse was unharnessed and put in the plot opposite, where there was some\ntender grass.  Dick lighted the fire already laid; and activity began to\nloosen their tongues a little.\n\n\"There!\" said Fancy, \"we forgot to bring the fire-irons!\"\n\nShe had originally found in her sitting-room, to bear out the expression\n'nearly furnished' which the school-manager had used in his letter to\nher, a table, three chairs, a fender, and a piece of carpet.  This\n'nearly' had been supplemented hitherto by a kind friend, who had lent\nher fire-irons and crockery until she should fetch some from home.\n\nDick attended to the young lady's fire, using his whip-handle for a poker\ntill it was spoilt, and then flourishing a hurdle stick for the remainder\nof the time.\n\n\"The kettle boils; now you shall have a cup of tea,\" said Fancy, diving\ninto the hamper she had brought.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Dick, whose drive had made him ready for some,\nespecially in her company.\n\n\"Well, here's only one cup-and-saucer, as I breathe!  Whatever could\nmother be thinking about?  Do you mind making shift, Mr. Dewy?\"\n\n\"Not at all, Miss Day,\" said that civil person.\n\n\"--And only having a cup by itself? or a saucer by itself?\"\n\n\"Don't mind in the least.\"\n\n\"Which do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I mean the cup, if you like the saucer.\"\n\n\"And the saucer, if I like the cup?\"\n\n\"Exactly, Miss Day.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Dewy, for I like the cup decidedly.  Stop a minute; there\nare no spoons now!\"  She dived into the hamper again, and at the end of\ntwo or three minutes looked up and said, \"I suppose you don't mind if I\ncan't find a spoon?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said the agreeable Richard.\n\n\"The fact is, the spoons have slipped down somewhere; right under the\nother things.  O yes, here's one, and only one.  You would rather have\none than not, I suppose, Mr. Dewy?\"\n\n\"Rather not.  I never did care much about spoons.\"\n\n\"Then I'll have it.  I do care about them.  You must stir up your tea\nwith a knife.  Would you mind lifting the kettle off, that it may not\nboil dry?\"\n\nDick leapt to the fireplace, and earnestly removed the kettle.\n\n\"There! you did it so wildly that you have made your hand black.  We\nalways use kettle-holders; didn't you learn housewifery as far as that,\nMr. Dewy?  Well, never mind the soot on your hand.  Come here.  I am\ngoing to rinse mine, too.\"\n\nThey went to a basin she had placed in the back room.  \"This is the only\nbasin I have,\" she said.  \"Turn up your sleeves, and by that time my\nhands will be washed, and you can come.\"\n\nHer hands were in the water now.  \"O, how vexing!\" she exclaimed.\n\"There's not a drop of water left for you, unless you draw it, and the\nwell is I don't know how many furlongs deep; all that was in the pitcher\nI used for the kettle and this basin.  Do you mind dipping the tips of\nyour fingers in the same?\"\n\n\"Not at all.  And to save time I won't wait till you have done, if you\nhave no objection?\"\n\nThereupon he plunged in his hands, and they paddled together.  It being\nthe first time in his life that he had touched female fingers under\nwater, Dick duly registered the sensation as rather a nice one.\n\n\"Really, I hardly know which are my own hands and which are yours, they\nhave got so mixed up together,\" she said, withdrawing her own very\nsuddenly.\n\n\"It doesn't matter at all,\" said Dick, \"at least as far as I am\nconcerned.\"\n\n\"There! no towel!  Whoever thinks of a towel till the hands are wet?\"\n\n\"Nobody.\"\n\n\"'Nobody.'  How very dull it is when people are so friendly!  Come here,\nMr. Dewy.  Now do you think you could lift the lid of that box with your\nelbow, and then, with something or other, take out a towel you will find\nunder the clean clothes?  Be sure don't touch any of them with your wet\nhands, for the things at the top are all Starched and Ironed.\"\n\nDick managed, by the aid of a knife and fork, to extract a towel from\nunder a muslin dress without wetting the latter; and for a moment he\nventured to assume a tone of criticism.\n\n\"I fear for that dress,\" he said, as they wiped their hands together.\n\n\"What?\" said Miss Day, looking into the box at the dress alluded to.  \"O,\nI know what you mean--that the vicar will never let me wear muslin?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I know it is condemned by all orders in the church as flaunting,\nand unfit for common wear for girls who've their living to get; but we'll\nsee.\"\n\n\"In the interest of the church, I hope you don't speak seriously.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do; but we'll see.\"  There was a comely determination on her lip,\nvery pleasant to a beholder who was neither bishop, priest, nor deacon.\n\"I think I can manage any vicar's views about me if he's under forty.\"\n\nDick rather wished she had never thought of managing vicars.\n\n\"I certainly shall be glad to get some of your delicious tea,\" he said in\nrather a free way, yet modestly, as became one in a position between that\nof visitor and inmate, and looking wistfully at his lonely saucer.\n\n\"So shall I.  Now is there anything else we want, Mr Dewy?\"\n\n\"I really think there's nothing else, Miss Day.\"\n\nShe prepared to sit down, looking musingly out of the window at Smart's\nenjoyment of the rich grass.  \"Nobody seems to care about me,\" she\nmurmured, with large lost eyes fixed upon the sky beyond Smart.\n\n\"Perhaps Mr. Shiner does,\" said Dick, in the tone of a slightly injured\nman.\n\n\"Yes, I forgot--he does, I know.\"  Dick precipitately regretted that he\nhad suggested Shiner, since it had produced such a miserable result as\nthis.\n\n\"I'll warrant you'll care for somebody very much indeed another day,\nwon't you, Mr. Dewy?\" she continued, looking very feelingly into the\nmathematical centre of his eyes.\n\n\"Ah, I'll warrant I shall,\" said Dick, feelingly too, and looking back\ninto her dark pupils, whereupon they were turned aside.\n\n\"I meant,\" she went on, preventing him from speaking just as he was going\nto narrate a forcible story about his feelings; \"I meant that nobody\ncomes to see if I have returned--not even the vicar.\"\n\n\"If you want to see him, I'll call at the vicarage directly we have had\nsome tea.\"\n\n\"No, no!  Don't let him come down here, whatever you do, whilst I am in\nsuch a state of disarrangement.  Parsons look so miserable and awkward\nwhen one's house is in a muddle; walking about, and making impossible\nsuggestions in quaint academic phrases till your flesh creeps and you\nwish them dead.  Do you take sugar?\"\n\nMr. Maybold was at this instant seen coming up the path.\n\n\"There!  That's he coming!  How I wish you were not here!--that is, how\nawkward--dear, dear!\" she exclaimed, with a quick ascent of blood to her\nface, and irritated with Dick rather than the vicar, as it seemed.\n\n\"Pray don't be alarmed on my account, Miss Day--good-afternoon!\" said\nDick in a huff, putting on his hat, and leaving the room hastily by the\nback-door.\n\nThe horse was caught and put in, and on mounting the shafts to start he\nsaw through the window the vicar, standing upon some books piled in a\nchair, and driving a nail into the wall; Fancy, with a demure glance,\nholding the canary-cage up to him, as if she had never in her life\nthought of anything but vicars and canaries.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII: DICK MEETS HIS FATHER\n\n\nFor several minutes Dick drove along homeward, with the inner eye of\nreflection so anxiously set on his passages at arms with Fancy, that the\nroad and scenery were as a thin mist over the real pictures of his mind.\nWas she a coquette?  The balance between the evidence that she did love\nhim and that she did not was so nicely struck, that his opinion had no\nstability.  She had let him put his hand upon hers; she had allowed her\ngaze to drop plumb into the depths of his--his into hers--three or four\ntimes; her manner had been very free with regard to the basin and towel;\nshe had appeared vexed at the mention of Shiner.  On the other hand, she\nhad driven him about the house like a quiet dog or cat, said Shiner cared\nfor her, and seemed anxious that Mr. Maybold should do the same.\n\nThinking thus as he neared the handpost at Mellstock Cross, sitting on\nthe front board of the spring cart--his legs on the outside, and his\nwhole frame jigging up and down like a candle-flame to the time of\nSmart's trotting--who should he see coming down the hill but his father\nin the light wagon, quivering up and down on a smaller scale of shakes,\nthose merely caused by the stones in the road.  They were soon crossing\neach other's front.\n\n\"Weh-hey!\" said the tranter to Smiler.\n\n\"Weh-hey!\" said Dick to Smart, in an echo of the same voice.\n\n\"Th'st hauled her back, I suppose?\" Reuben inquired peaceably.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dick, with such a clinching period at the end that it seemed\nhe was never going to add another word.  Smiler, thinking this the close\nof the conversation, prepared to move on.\n\n\"Weh-hey!\" said the tranter.  \"I tell thee what it is, Dick.  That there\nmaid is taking up thy thoughts more than's good for thee, my sonny.\nThou'rt never happy now unless th'rt making thyself miserable about her\nin one way or another.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, father,\" said Dick rather stupidly.\n\n\"But I do--Wey, Smiler!--'Od rot the women, 'tis nothing else wi' 'em\nnowadays but getting young men and leading 'em astray.\"\n\n\"Pooh, father! you just repeat what all the common world says; that's all\nyou do.\"\n\n\"The world's a very sensible feller on things in jineral, Dick; very\nsensible indeed.\"\n\nDick looked into the distance at a vast expanse of mortgaged estate.  \"I\nwish I was as rich as a squire when he's as poor as a crow,\" he murmured;\n\"I'd soon ask Fancy something.\"\n\n\"I wish so too, wi' all my heart, sonny; that I do.  Well, mind what\nbeest about, that's all.\"\n\nSmart moved on a step or two.  \"Supposing now, father,--We-hey, Smart!--I\ndid think a little about her, and I had a chance, which I ha'n't; don't\nyou think she's a very good sort of--of--one?\"\n\n\"Ay, good; she's good enough.  When you've made up your mind to marry,\ntake the first respectable body that comes to hand--she's as good as any\nother; they be all alike in the groundwork; 'tis only in the flourishes\nthere's a difference.  She's good enough; but I can't see what the nation\na young feller like you--wi' a comfortable house and home, and father and\nmother to take care o' thee, and who sent 'ee to a school so good that\n'twas hardly fair to the other children--should want to go hollering\nafter a young woman for, when she's quietly making a husband in her\npocket, and not troubled by chick nor chiel, to make a poverty-stric'\nwife and family of her, and neither hat, cap, wig, nor waistcoat to set\n'em up with: be drowned if I can see it, and that's the long and the\nshort o't, my sonny.\"\n\nDick looked at Smart's ears, then up the hill; but no reason was\nsuggested by any object that met his gaze.\n\n\"For about the same reason that you did, father, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Dang it, my sonny, thou'st got me there!\"  And the tranter gave vent to\na grim admiration, with the mien of a man who was too magnanimous not to\nappreciate artistically a slight rap on the knuckles, even if they were\nhis own.\n\n\"Whether or no,\" said Dick, \"I asked her a thing going along the road.\"\n\n\"Come to that, is it?  Turk! won't thy mother be in a taking!  Well,\nshe's ready, I don't doubt?\"\n\n\"I didn't ask her anything about having me; and if you'll let me speak,\nI'll tell 'ee what I want to know.  I just said, Did she care about me?\"\n\n\"Piph-ph-ph!\"\n\n\"And then she said nothing for a quarter of a mile, and then she said she\ndidn't know.  Now, what I want to know is, what was the meaning of that\nspeech?\"  The latter words were spoken resolutely, as if he didn't care\nfor the ridicule of all the fathers in creation.\n\n\"The meaning of that speech is,\" the tranter replied deliberately, \"that\nthe meaning is meant to be rather hid at present.  Well, Dick, as an\nhonest father to thee, I don't pretend to deny what you d'know well\nenough; that is, that her father being rather better in the pocket than\nwe, I should welcome her ready enough if it must be somebody.\"\n\n\"But what d'ye think she really did mean?\" said the unsatisfied Dick.\n\n\"I'm afeard I am not o' much account in guessing, especially as I was not\nthere when she said it, and seeing that your mother was the only 'ooman I\never cam' into such close quarters as that with.\"\n\n\"And what did mother say to you when you asked her?\" said Dick musingly.\n\n\"I don't see that that will help 'ee.\"\n\n\"The principle is the same.\"\n\n\"Well--ay: what did she say?  Let's see.  I was oiling my working-day\nboots without taking 'em off, and wi' my head hanging down, when she just\nbrushed on by the garden hatch like a flittering leaf.  'Ann,' I said,\nsays I, and then,--but, Dick I'm afeard 'twill be no help to thee; for we\nwere such a rum couple, your mother and I, leastways one half was, that\nis myself--and your mother's charms was more in the manner than the\nmaterial.\"\n\n\"Never mind!  'Ann,' said you.\"\n\n\"'Ann,' said I, as I was saying . . . 'Ann,' I said to her when I was\noiling my working-day boots wi' my head hanging down, 'Woot hae me?' . .\n. What came next I can't quite call up at this distance o' time.  Perhaps\nyour mother would know,--she's got a better memory for her little\ntriumphs than I.  However, the long and the short o' the story is that we\nwere married somehow, as I found afterwards.  'Twas on White\nTuesday,--Mellstock Club walked the same day, every man two and two, and\na fine day 'twas,--hot as fire,--how the sun did strike down upon my back\ngoing to church!  I well can mind what a bath o' sweating I was in, body\nand soul!  But Fance will ha' thee, Dick--she won't walk with another\nchap--no such good luck.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Dick, whipping at Smart's flank in a\nfanciful way, which, as Smart knew, meant nothing in connection with\ngoing on.  \"There's Pa'son Maybold, too--that's all against me.\"\n\n\"What about he?  She's never been stuffing into thy innocent heart that\nhe's in hove with her?  Lord, the vanity o' maidens!\"\n\n\"No, no.  But he called, and she looked at him in such a way, and at me\nin such a way--quite different the ways were,--and as I was coming off,\nthere was he hanging up her birdcage.\"\n\n\"Well, why shouldn't the man hang up her bird-cage?  Turk seize it all,\nwhat's that got to do wi' it?  Dick, that thou beest a white-lyvered chap\nI don't say, but if thou beestn't as mad as a cappel-faced bull, let me\nsmile no more.\"\n\n\"O, ay.\"\n\n\"And what's think now, Dick?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Here's another pretty kettle o' fish for thee.  Who d'ye think's the\nbitter weed in our being turned out?  Did our party tell 'ee?\"\n\n\"No.  Why, Pa'son Maybold, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Shiner,--because he's in love with thy young woman, and d'want to see\nher young figure sitting up at that queer instrument, and her young\nfingers rum-strumming upon the keys.\"\n\nA sharp ado of sweet and bitter was going on in Dick during this\ncommunication from his father.  \"Shiner's a fool!--no, that's not it; I\ndon't believe any such thing, father.  Why, Shiner would never take a\nbold step like that, unless she'd been a little made up to, and had taken\nit kindly.  Pooh!\"\n\n\"Who's to say she didn't?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"The more fool you.\"\n\n\"Why, father of me?\"\n\n\"Has she ever done more to thee?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then she has done as much to he--rot 'em!  Now, Dick, this is how a maid\nis.  She'll swear she's dying for thee, and she is dying for thee, and\nshe will die for thee; but she'll fling a look over t'other shoulder at\nanother young feller, though never leaving off dying for thee just the\nsame.\"\n\n\"She's not dying for me, and so she didn't fling a look at him.\"\n\n\"But she may be dying for him, for she looked at thee.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to make of it at all,\" said Dick gloomily.\n\n\"All I can make of it is,\" the tranter said, raising his whip, arranging\nhis different joints and muscles, and motioning to the horse to move on,\n\"that if you can't read a maid's mind by her motions, nature d'seem to\nsay thou'st ought to be a bachelor.  Clk, clk!  Smiler!\"  And the tranter\nmoved on.\n\nDick held Smart's rein firmly, and the whole concern of horse, cart, and\nman remained rooted in the lane.  How long this condition would have\nlasted is unknown, had not Dick's thoughts, after adding up numerous\nitems of misery, gradually wandered round to the fact that as something\nmust be done, it could not be done by staying there all night.\n\nReaching home he went up to his bedroom, shut the door as if he were\ngoing to be seen no more in this life, and taking a sheet of paper and\nuncorking the ink-bottle, he began a letter.  The dignity of the writer's\nmind was so powerfully apparent in every line of this effusion that it\nobscured the logical sequence of facts and intentions to an appreciable\ndegree; and it was not at all clear to a reader whether he there and then\nleft off loving Miss Fancy Day; whether he had never loved her seriously,\nand never meant to; whether he had been dying up to the present moment,\nand now intended to get well again; or whether he had hitherto been in\ngood health, and intended to die for her forthwith.\n\nHe put this letter in an envelope, sealed it up, directed it in a stern\nhandwriting of straight dashes--easy flourishes being rigorously\nexcluded.  He walked with it in his pocket down the lane in strides not\nan inch less than three feet long.  Reaching her gate he put on a\nresolute expression--then put it off again, turned back homeward, tore up\nhis letter, and sat down.\n\nThat letter was altogether in a wrong tone--that he must own.  A\nheartless man-of-the-world tone was what the juncture required.  That he\nrather wanted her, and rather did not want her--the latter for choice;\nbut that as a member of society he didn't mind making a query in jaunty\nterms, which could only be answered in the same way: did she mean\nanything by her bearing towards him, or did she not?\n\nThis letter was considered so satisfactory in every way that, being put\ninto the hands of a little boy, and the order given that he was to run\nwith it to the school, he was told in addition not to look behind him if\nDick called after him to bring it back, but to run along with it just the\nsame.  Having taken this precaution against vacillation, Dick watched his\nmessenger down the road, and turned into the house whistling an air in\nsuch ghastly jerks and starts, that whistling seemed to be the act the\nvery furthest removed from that which was instinctive in such a youth.\n\nThe letter was left as ordered: the next morning came and passed--and no\nanswer.  The next.  The next.  Friday night came.  Dick resolved that if\nno answer or sign were given by her the next day, on Sunday he would meet\nher face to face, and have it all out by word of mouth.\n\n\"Dick,\" said his father, coming in from the garden at that moment--in\neach hand a hive of bees tied in a cloth to prevent their egress--\"I\nthink you'd better take these two swarms of bees to Mrs. Maybold's to-\nmorrow, instead o' me, and I'll go wi' Smiler and the wagon.\"\n\nIt was a relief; for Mrs. Maybold, the vicar's mother, who had just taken\ninto her head a fancy for keeping bees (pleasantly disguised under the\npretence of its being an economical wish to produce her own honey), lived\nnear the watering-place of Budmouth-Regis, ten miles off, and the\nbusiness of transporting the hives thither would occupy the whole day,\nand to some extent annihilate the vacant time between this evening and\nthe coming Sunday.  The best spring-cart was washed throughout, the axles\noiled, and the bees placed therein for the journey.\n\n\n\n\nPART THE THIRD--SUMMER\n\n\nCHAPTER I: DRIVING OUT OF BUDMOUTH\n\n\nAn easy bend of neck and graceful set of head; full and wavy bundles of\ndark-brown hair; light fall of little feet; pretty devices on the skirt\nof the dress; clear deep eyes; in short, a bunch of sweets: it was Fancy!\nDick's heart went round to her with a rush.\n\nThe scene was the corner of Mary Street in Budmouth-Regis, near the\nKing's statue, at which point the white angle of the last house in the\nrow cut perpendicularly an embayed and nearly motionless expanse of salt\nwater projected from the outer ocean--to-day lit in bright tones of green\nand opal.  Dick and Smart had just emerged from the street, and there on\nthe right, against the brilliant sheet of liquid colour, stood Fancy Day;\nand she turned and recognized him.\n\nDick suspended his thoughts of the letter and wonder at how she came\nthere by driving close to the chains of the Esplanade--incontinently\ndisplacing two chairmen, who had just come to life for the summer in new\nclean shirts and revivified clothes, and being almost displaced in turn\nby a rigid boy rattling along with a baker's cart, and looking neither to\nthe right nor the left.  He asked if she were going to Mellstock that\nnight.\n\n\"Yes, I'm waiting for the carrier,\" she replied, seeming, too, to suspend\nthoughts of the letter.\n\n\"Now I can drive you home nicely, and you save half an hour.  Will ye\ncome with me?\"\n\nAs Fancy's power to will anything seemed to have departed in some\nmysterious manner at that moment, Dick settled the matter by getting out\nand assisting her into the vehicle without another word.\n\nThe temporary flush upon her cheek changed to a lesser hue, which was\npermanent, and at length their eyes met; there was present between them a\ncertain feeling of embarrassment, which arises at such moments when all\nthe instinctive acts dictated by the position have been performed.  Dick,\nbeing engaged with the reins, thought less of this awkwardness than did\nFancy, who had nothing to do but to feel his presence, and to be more and\nmore conscious of the fact, that by accepting a seat beside him in this\nway she succumbed to the tone of his note.  Smart jogged along, and Dick\njogged, and the helpless Fancy necessarily jogged, too; and she felt that\nshe was in a measure captured and made a prisoner.\n\n\"I am so much obliged to you for your company, Miss Day,\" he observed, as\nthey drove past the two semicircular bays of the Old Royal Hotel, where\nHis Majesty King George the Third had many a time attended the balls of\nthe burgesses.\n\nTo Miss Day, crediting him with the same consciousness of mastery--a\nconsciousness of which he was perfectly innocent--this remark sounded\nlike a magnanimous intention to soothe her, the captive.\n\n\"I didn't come for the pleasure of obliging you with my company,\" she\nsaid.\n\nThe answer had an unexpected manner of incivility in it that must have\nbeen rather surprising to young Dewy.  At the same time it may be\nobserved, that when a young woman returns a rude answer to a young man's\ncivil remark, her heart is in a state which argues rather hopefully for\nhis case than otherwise.\n\nThere was silence between them till they had left the sea-front and\npassed about twenty of the trees that ornamented the road leading up out\nof the town towards Casterbridge and Mellstock.\n\n\"Though I didn't come for that purpose either, I would have done it,\"\nsaid Dick at the twenty-first tree.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Dewy, no flirtation, because it's wrong, and I don't wish it.\"\n\nDick seated himself afresh just as he had been sitting before, arranged\nhis looks very emphatically, and cleared his throat.\n\n\"Really, anybody would think you had met me on business and were just\ngoing to commence,\" said the lady intractably.\n\n\"Yes, they would.\"\n\n\"Why, you never have, to be sure!\"\n\nThis was a shaky beginning.  He chopped round, and said cheerily, as a\nman who had resolved never to spoil his jollity by loving one of\nwomankind--\n\n\"Well, how are you getting on, Miss Day, at the present time?  Gaily, I\ndon't doubt for a moment.\"\n\n\"I am not gay, Dick; you know that.\"\n\n\"Gaily doesn't mean decked in gay dresses.\"\n\n\"I didn't suppose gaily was gaily dressed.  Mighty me, what a scholar\nyou've grown!\"\n\n\"Lots of things have happened to you this spring, I see.\"\n\n\"What have you seen?\"\n\n\"O, nothing; I've heard, I mean!\"\n\n\"What have you heard?\"\n\n\"The name of a pretty man, with brass studs and a copper ring and a tin\nwatch-chain, a little mixed up with your own.  That's all.\"\n\n\"That's a very unkind picture of Mr. Shiner, for that's who you mean!  The\nstuds are gold, as you know, and it's a real silver chain; the ring I\ncan't conscientiously defend, and he only wore it once.\"\n\n\"He might have worn it a hundred times without showing it half so much.\"\n\n\"Well, he's nothing to me,\" she serenely observed.\n\n\"Not any more than I am?\"\n\n\"Now, Mr. Dewy,\" said Fancy severely, \"certainly he isn't any more to me\nthan you are!\"\n\n\"Not so much?\"\n\nShe looked aside to consider the precise compass of that question.  \"That\nI can't exactly answer,\" she replied with soft archness.\n\nAs they were going rather slowly, another spring-cart, containing a\nfarmer, farmer's wife, and farmer's man, jogged past them; and the\nfarmer's wife and farmer's man eyed the couple very curiously.  The\nfarmer never looked up from the horse's tail.\n\n\"Why can't you exactly answer?\" said Dick, quickening Smart a little, and\njogging on just behind the farmer and farmer's wife and man.\n\nAs no answer came, and as their eyes had nothing else to do, they both\ncontemplated the picture presented in front, and noticed how the farmer's\nwife sat flattened between the two men, who bulged over each end of the\nseat to give her room, till they almost sat upon their respective wheels;\nand they looked too at the farmer's wife's silk mantle, inflating itself\nbetween her shoulders like a balloon and sinking flat again, at each jog\nof the horse.  The farmer's wife, feeling their eyes sticking into her\nback, looked over her shoulder.  Dick dropped ten yards further behind.\n\n\"Fancy, why can't you answer?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Because how much you are to me depends upon how much I am to you,\" said\nshe in low tones.\n\n\"Everything,\" said Dick, putting his hand towards hers, and casting\nemphatic eyes upon the upper curve of her cheek.\n\n\"Now, Richard Dewy, no touching me!  I didn't say in what way your\nthinking of me affected the question--perhaps inversely, don't you see?\nNo touching, sir!  Look; goodness me, don't, Dick!\"\n\nThe cause of her sudden start was the unpleasant appearance over Dick's\nright shoulder of an empty timber-wagon and four journeymen-carpenters\nreclining in lazy postures inside it, their eyes directed upwards at\nvarious oblique angles into the surrounding world, the chief object of\ntheir existence being apparently to criticize to the very backbone and\nmarrow every animate object that came within the compass of their vision.\nThis difficulty of Dick's was overcome by trotting on till the wagon and\ncarpenters were beginning to look rather misty by reason of a film of\ndust that accompanied their wagon-wheels, and rose around their heads\nlike a fog.\n\n\"Say you love me, Fancy.\"\n\n\"No, Dick, certainly not; 'tisn't time to do that yet.\"\n\n\"Why, Fancy?\"\n\n\"'Miss Day' is better at present--don't mind my saying so; and I ought\nnot to have called you Dick.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! when you know that I would do anything on earth for your love.\nWhy, you make any one think that loving is a thing that can be done and\nundone, and put on and put off at a mere whim.\"\n\n\"No, no, I don't,\" she said gently; \"but there are things which tell me I\nought not to give way to much thinking about you, even if--\"\n\n\"But you want to, don't you?  Yes, say you do; it is best to be truthful.\nWhatever they may say about a woman's right to conceal where her love\nlies, and pretend it doesn't exist, and things like that, it is not best;\nI do know it, Fancy.  And an honest woman in that, as well as in all her\ndaily concerns, shines most brightly, and is thought most of in the long-\nrun.\"\n\n\"Well then, perhaps, Dick, I do love you a little,\" she whispered\ntenderly; \"but I wish you wouldn't say any more now.\"\n\n\"I won't say any more now, then, if you don't like it, dear.  But you do\nlove me a little, don't you?\"\n\n\"Now you ought not to want me to keep saying things twice; I can't say\nany more now, and you must be content with what you have.\"\n\n\"I may at any rate call you Fancy?  There's no harm in that.\"\n\n\"Yes, you may.\"\n\n\"And you'll not call me Mr. Dewy any more?\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II: FURTHER ALONG THE ROAD\n\n\nDick's spirits having risen in the course of these admissions of his\nsweetheart, he now touched Smart with the whip; and on Smart's neck, not\nfar behind his ears.  Smart, who had been lost in thought for some time,\nnever dreaming that Dick could reach so far with a whip which, on this\nparticular journey, had never been extended further than his flank,\ntossed his head, and scampered along with exceeding briskness, which was\nvery pleasant to the young couple behind him till, turning a bend in the\nroad, they came instantly upon the farmer, farmer's man, and farmer's\nwife with the flapping mantle, all jogging on just the same as ever.\n\n\"Bother those people!  Here we are upon them again.\"\n\n\"Well, of course.  They have as much right to the road as we.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it is provoking to be overlooked so.  I like a road all to\nmyself.  Look what a lumbering affair theirs is!\"  The wheels of the\nfarmer's cart, just at that moment, jogged into a depression running\nacross the road, giving the cart a twist, whereupon all three nodded to\nthe left, and on coming out of it all three nodded to the right, and went\non jerking their backs in and out as usual.  \"We'll pass them when the\nroad gets wider.\"\n\nWhen an opportunity seemed to offer itself for carrying this intention\ninto effect, they heard light flying wheels behind, and on their\nquartering there whizzed along past them a brand-new gig, so brightly\npolished that the spokes of the wheels sent forth a continual quivering\nlight at one point in their circle, and all the panels glared like\nmirrors in Dick and Fancy's eyes.  The driver, and owner as it appeared,\nwas really a handsome man; his companion was Shiner.  Both turned round\nas they passed Dick and Fancy, and stared with bold admiration in her\nface till they were obliged to attend to the operation of passing the\nfarmer.  Dick glanced for an instant at Fancy while she was undergoing\ntheir scrutiny; then returned to his driving with rather a sad\ncountenance.\n\n\"Why are you so silent?\" she said, after a while, with real concern.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is, Dick.  I couldn't help those people passing.\"\n\n\"I know that.\"\n\n\"You look offended with me.  What have I done?\"\n\n\"I can't tell without offending you.\"\n\n\"Better out.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Dick, who seemed longing to tell, even at the risk of\noffending her, \"I was thinking how different you in love are from me in\nlove.  Whilst those men were staring, you dismissed me from your thoughts\naltogether, and--\"\n\n\"You can't offend me further now; tell all!\"\n\n\"And showed upon your face a pleased sense of being attractive to 'em.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, Dick!  You know very well I didn't.\"\n\nDick shook his head sceptically, and smiled.\n\n\"Dick, I always believe flattery if possible--and it was possible then.\nNow there's an open confession of weakness.  But I showed no\nconsciousness of it.\"\n\nDick, perceiving by her look that she would adhere to her statement,\ncharitably forbore saying anything that could make her prevaricate.  The\nsight of Shiner, too, had recalled another branch of the subject to his\nmind; that which had been his greatest trouble till her company and words\nhad obscured its probability.\n\n\"By the way, Fancy, do you know why our quire is to be dismissed?\"\n\n\"No: except that it is Mr. Maybold's wish for me to play the organ.\"\n\n\"Do you know how it came to be his wish?\"\n\n\"That I don't.\"\n\n\"Mr. Shiner, being churchwarden, has persuaded the vicar; who, however,\nwas willing enough before.  Shiner, I know, is crazy to see you playing\nevery Sunday; I suppose he'll turn over your music, for the organ will be\nclose to his pew.  But--I know you have never encouraged him?\"\n\n\"Never once!\" said Fancy emphatically, and with eyes full of earnest\ntruth.  \"I don't like him indeed, and I never heard of his doing this\nbefore!  I have always felt that I should like to play in a church, but I\nnever wished to turn you and your choir out; and I never even said that I\ncould play till I was asked.  You don't think for a moment that I did,\nsurely, do you?\"\n\n\"I know you didn't, dear.\"\n\n\"Or that I care the least morsel of a bit for him?\"\n\n\"I know you don't.\"\n\nThe distance between Budmouth and Mellstock was ten or eleven miles, and\nthere being a good inn, 'The Ship,' four miles out of Budmouth, with a\nmast and cross-trees in front, Dick's custom in driving thither was to\ndivide the journey into three stages by resting at this inn going and\ncoming, and not troubling the Budmouth stables at all, whenever his visit\nto the town was a mere call and deposit, as to-day.\n\nFancy was ushered into a little tea-room, and Dick went to the stables to\nsee to the feeding of Smart.  In face of the significant twitches of\nfeature that were visible in the ostler and labouring men idling around,\nDick endeavoured to look unconscious of the fact that there was any\nsentiment between him and Fancy beyond a tranter's desire to carry a\npassenger home.  He presently entered the inn and opened the door of\nFancy's room.\n\n\"Dick, do you know, it has struck me that it is rather awkward, my being\nhere alone with you like this.  I don't think you had better come in with\nme.\"\n\n\"That's rather unpleasant, dear.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is, and I wanted you to have some tea as well as myself too,\nbecause you must be tired.\"\n\n\"Well, let me have some with you, then.  I was denied once before, if you\nrecollect, Fancy.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, never mind!  And it seems unfriendly of me now, but I don't\nknow what to do.\"\n\n\"It shall be as you say, then.\"  Dick began to retreat with a\ndissatisfied wrinkling of face, and a farewell glance at the cosy tea-\ntray.\n\n\"But you don't see how it is, Dick, when you speak like that,\" she said,\nwith more earnestness than she had ever shown before.  \"You do know, that\neven if I care very much for you, I must remember that I have a difficult\nposition to maintain.  The vicar would not like me, as his\nschoolmistress, to indulge in a tete-a-tete anywhere with anybody.\"\n\n\"But I am not any body!\" exclaimed Dick.\n\n\"No, no, I mean with a young man;\" and she added softly, \"unless I were\nreally engaged to be married to him.\"\n\n\"Is that all?  Then, dearest, dearest, why we'll be engaged at once, to\nbe sure we will, and down I sit!  There it is, as easy as a glove!\"\n\n\"Ah! but suppose I won't!  And, goodness me, what have I done!\" she\nfaltered, getting very red.  \"Positively, it seems as if I meant you to\nsay that!\"\n\n\"Let's do it!  I mean get engaged,\" said Dick.  \"Now, Fancy, will you be\nmy wife?\"\n\n\"Do you know, Dick, it was rather unkind of you to say what you did\ncoming along the road,\" she remarked, as if she had not heard the latter\npart of his speech; though an acute observer might have noticed about her\nbreast, as the word 'wife' fell from Dick's lips, a soft silent escape of\nbreaths, with very short rests between each.\n\n\"What did I say?\"\n\n\"About my trying to look attractive to those men in the gig.\"\n\n\"You couldn't help looking so, whether you tried or no.  And, Fancy, you\ndo care for me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very much?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you'll be my own wife?\"\n\nHer heart quickened, adding to and withdrawing from her cheek varying\ntones of red to match each varying thought.  Dick looked expectantly at\nthe ripe tint of her delicate mouth, waiting for what was coming forth.\n\n\"Yes--if father will let me.\"\n\nDick drew himself close to her, compressing his lips and pouting them\nout, as if he were about to whistle the softest melody known.\n\n\"O no!\" said Fancy solemnly.\n\nThe modest Dick drew back a little.\n\n\"Dick, Dick, kiss me and let me go instantly!--here's somebody coming!\"\nshe whisperingly exclaimed.\n\n* * *\n\nHalf an hour afterwards Dick emerged from the inn, and if Fancy's lips\nhad been real cherries probably Dick's would have appeared deeply\nstained.  The landlord was standing in the yard.\n\n\"Heu-heu! hay-hay, Master Dewy!  Ho-ho!\" he laughed, letting the laugh\nslip out gently and by degrees that it might make little noise in its\nexit, and smiting Dick under the fifth rib at the same time.  \"This will\nnever do, upon my life, Master Dewy! calling for tay for a feymel\npassenger, and then going in and sitting down and having some too, and\nbiding such a fine long time!\"\n\n\"But surely you know?\" said Dick, with great apparent surprise.  \"Yes,\nyes!  Ha-ha!\" smiting the landlord under the ribs in return.\n\n\"Why, what?  Yes, yes; ha-ha!\"\n\n\"You know, of course!\"\n\n\"Yes, of course!  But--that is--I don't.\"\n\n\"Why about--between that young lady and me?\" nodding to the window of the\nroom that Fancy occupied.\n\n\"No; not I!\" said the innkeeper, bringing his eyes into circles.\n\n\"And you don't!\"\n\n\"Not a word, I'll take my oath!\"\n\n\"But you laughed when I laughed.\"\n\n\"Ay, that was me sympathy; so did you when I laughed!\"\n\n\"Really, you don't know?  Goodness--not knowing that!\"\n\n\"I'll take my oath I don't!\"\n\n\"O yes,\" said Dick, with frigid rhetoric of pitying astonishment, \"we're\nengaged to be married, you see, and I naturally look after her.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course!  I didn't know that, and I hope ye'll excuse any\nlittle freedom of mine, Mr. Dewy.  But it is a very odd thing; I was\ntalking to your father very intimate about family matters only last\nFriday in the world, and who should come in but Keeper Day, and we all\nthen fell a-talking o' family matters; but neither one o' them said a\nmortal word about it; knowen me too so many years, and I at your father's\nown wedding.  'Tisn't what I should have expected from an old neighbour!\"\n\n\"Well, to say the truth, we hadn't told father of the engagement at that\ntime; in fact, 'twasn't settled.\"\n\n\"Ah! the business was done Sunday.  Yes, yes, Sunday's the courting day.\nHeu-heu!\"\n\n\"No, 'twasn't done Sunday in particular.\"\n\n\"After school-hours this week?  Well, a very good time, a very proper\ngood time.\"\n\n\"O no, 'twasn't done then.\"\n\n\"Coming along the road to-day then, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not at all; I wouldn't think of getting engaged in a dog-cart.\"\n\n\"Dammy--might as well have said at once, the when be blowed!  Anyhow,\n'tis a fine day, and I hope next time you'll come as one.\"\n\nFancy was duly brought out and assisted into the vehicle, and the newly\naffianced youth and maiden passed up the steep hill to the Ridgeway, and\nvanished in the direction of Mellstock.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III: A CONFESSION\n\n\nIt was a morning of the latter summer-time; a morning of lingering dews,\nwhen the grass is never dry in the shade.  Fuchsias and dahlias were\nladen till eleven o'clock with small drops and dashes of water, changing\nthe colour of their sparkle at every movement of the air; and elsewhere\nhanging on twigs like small silver fruit.  The threads of garden spiders\nappeared thick and polished.  In the dry and sunny places, dozens of long-\nlegged crane-flies whizzed off the grass at every step the passer took.\n\nFancy Day and her friend Susan Dewy the tranter's daughter, were in such\na spot as this, pulling down a bough laden with early apples.  Three\nmonths had elapsed since Dick and Fancy had journeyed together from\nBudmouth, and the course of their love had run on vigorously during the\nwhole time.  There had been just enough difficulty attending its\ndevelopment, and just enough finesse required in keeping it private, to\nlend the passion an ever-increasing freshness on Fancy's part, whilst,\nwhether from these accessories or not, Dick's heart had been at all times\nas fond as could be desired.  But there was a cloud on Fancy's horizon\nnow.\n\n\"She is so well off--better than any of us,\" Susan Dewy was saying.  \"Her\nfather farms five hundred acres, and she might marry a doctor or curate\nor anything of that kind if she contrived a little.\"\n\n\"I don't think Dick ought to have gone to that gipsy-party at all when he\nknew I couldn't go,\" replied Fancy uneasily.\n\n\"He didn't know that you would not be there till it was too late to\nrefuse the invitation,\" said Susan.\n\n\"And what was she like?  Tell me.\"\n\n\"Well, she was rather pretty, I must own.\"\n\n\"Tell straight on about her, can't you!  Come, do, Susan.  How many times\ndid you say he danced with her?\"\n\n\"Once.\"\n\n\"Twice, I think you said?\"\n\n\"Indeed I'm sure I didn't.\"\n\n\"Well, and he wanted to again, I expect.\"\n\n\"No; I don't think he did.  She wanted to dance with him again bad\nenough, I know.  Everybody does with Dick, because he's so handsome and\nsuch a clever courter.\"\n\n\"O, I wish!--How did you say she wore her hair?\"\n\n\"In long curls,--and her hair is light, and it curls without being put in\npaper: that's how it is she's so attractive.\"\n\n\"She's trying to get him away! yes, yes, she is!  And through keeping\nthis miserable school I mustn't wear my hair in curls!  But I will; I\ndon't care if I leave the school and go home, I will wear my curls!  Look,\nSusan, do! is her hair as soft and long as this?\"  Fancy pulled from its\ncoil under her hat a twine of her own hair, and stretched it down her\nshoulder to show its length, looking at Susan to catch her opinion from\nher eyes.\n\n\"It is about the same length as that, I think,\" said Miss Dewy.\n\nFancy paused hopelessly.  \"I wish mine was lighter, like hers!\" she\ncontinued mournfully.  \"But hers isn't so soft, is it?  Tell me, now.\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nFancy abstractedly extended her vision to survey a yellow butterfly and a\nred-and-black butterfly that were flitting along in company, and then\nbecame aware that Dick was advancing up the garden.\n\n\"Susan, here's Dick coming; I suppose that's because we've been talking\nabout him.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I shall go indoors now--you won't want me;\" and Susan turned\npractically and walked off.\n\nEnter the single-minded Dick, whose only fault at the gipsying, or\npicnic, had been that of loving Fancy too exclusively, and depriving\nhimself of the innocent pleasure the gathering might have afforded him,\nby sighing regretfully at her absence,--who had danced with the rival in\nsheer despair of ever being able to get through that stale, flat, and\nunprofitable afternoon in any other way; but this she would not believe.\n\nFancy had settled her plan of emotion.  To reproach Dick?  O no, no.  \"I\nam in great trouble,\" said she, taking what was intended to be a\nhopelessly melancholy survey of a few small apples lying under the tree;\nyet a critical ear might have noticed in her voice a tentative tone as to\nthe effect of the words upon Dick when she uttered them.\n\n\"What are you in trouble about?  Tell me of it,\" said Dick earnestly.\n\"Darling, I will share it with 'ee and help 'ee.\"\n\n\"No, no: you can't!  Nobody can!\"\n\n\"Why not?  You don't deserve it, whatever it is.  Tell me, dear.\"\n\n\"O, it isn't what you think!  It is dreadful: my own sin!\"\n\n\"Sin, Fancy! as if you could sin!  I know it can't be.\"\n\n\"'Tis, 'tis!\" said the young lady, in a pretty little frenzy of sorrow.\n\"I have done wrong, and I don't like to tell it!  Nobody will forgive me,\nnobody! and you above all will not! . . . I have allowed myself\nto--to--fl--\"\n\n\"What,--not flirt!\" he said, controlling his emotion as it were by a\nsudden pressure inward from his surface.  \"And you said only the day\nbefore yesterday that you hadn't flirted in your life!\"\n\n\"Yes, I did; and that was a wicked story!  I have let another love me,\nand--\"\n\n\"Good G--!  Well, I'll forgive you,--yes, if you couldn't help it,--yes,\nI will!\" said the now dismal Dick.  \"Did you encourage him?\"\n\n\"O,--I don't know,--yes--no.  O, I think so!\"\n\n\"Who was it?\"  A pause.  \"Tell me!\"\n\n\"Mr. Shiner.\"\n\nAfter a silence that was only disturbed by the fall of an apple, a long-\nchecked sigh from Dick, and a sob from Fancy, he said with real\nausterity--\n\n\"Tell it all;--every word!\"\n\n\"He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he said, 'Will you let me show\nyou how to catch bullfinches down here by the stream?'  And I--wanted to\nknow very much--I did so long to have a bullfinch!  I couldn't help that\nand I said, 'Yes!' and then he said, 'Come here.'  And I went with him\ndown to the lovely river, and then he said to me, 'Look and see how I do\nit, and then you'll know: I put this birdlime round this twig, and then I\ngo here,' he said, 'and hide away under a bush; and presently clever\nMister Bird comes and perches upon the twig, and flaps his wings, and\nyou've got him before you can say Jack'--something; O, O, O, I forget\nwhat!\"\n\n\"Jack Sprat,\" mournfully suggested Dick through the cloud of his misery.\n\n\"No, not Jack Sprat,\" she sobbed.\n\n\"Then 'twas Jack Robinson!\" he said, with the emphasis of a man who had\nresolved to discover every iota of the truth, or die.\n\n\"Yes, that was it!  And then I put my hand upon the rail of the bridge to\nget across, and--That's all.\"\n\n\"Well, that isn't much, either,\" said Dick critically, and more\ncheerfully.  \"Not that I see what business Shiner has to take upon\nhimself to teach you anything.  But it seems--it do seem there must have\nbeen more than that to set you up in such a dreadful taking?\"\n\nHe looked into Fancy's eyes.  Misery of miseries!--guilt was written\nthere still.\n\n\"Now, Fancy, you've not told me all!\" said Dick, rather sternly for a\nquiet young man.\n\n\"O, don't speak so cruelly!  I am afraid to tell now!  If you hadn't been\nharsh, I was going on to tell all; now I can't!\"\n\n\"Come, dear Fancy, tell: come.  I'll forgive; I must,--by heaven and\nearth, I must, whether I will or no; I love you so!\"\n\n\"Well, when I put my hand on the bridge, he touched it--\"\n\n\"A scamp!\" said Dick, grinding an imaginary human frame to powder.\n\n\"And then he looked at me, and at last he said, 'Are you in love with\nDick Dewy?'  And I said, 'Perhaps I am!' and then he said, 'I wish you\nweren't then, for I want to marry you, with all my soul.'\"\n\n\"There's a villain now!  Want to marry you!\"  And Dick quivered with the\nbitterness of satirical laughter.  Then suddenly remembering that he\nmight be reckoning without his host: \"Unless, to be sure, you are willing\nto have him,--perhaps you are,\" he said, with the wretched indifference\nof a castaway.\n\n\"No, indeed I am not!\" she said, her sobs just beginning to take a\nfavourable turn towards cure.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Dick, coming a little to his senses, \"you've been\nstretching it very much in giving such a dreadful beginning to such a\nmere nothing.  And I know what you've done it for,--just because of that\ngipsy-party!\"  He turned away from her and took five paces decisively, as\nif he were tired of an ungrateful country, including herself.  \"You did\nit to make me jealous, and I won't stand it!\"  He flung the words to her\nover his shoulder and then stalked on, apparently very anxious to walk to\nthe remotest of the Colonies that very minute.\n\n\"O, O, O, Dick--Dick!\" she cried, trotting after him like a pet lamb, and\nreally seriously alarmed at last, \"you'll kill me!  My impulses are\nbad--miserably wicked,--and I can't help it; forgive me, Dick!  And I\nlove you always; and those times when you look silly and don't seem quite\ngood enough for me,--just the same, I do, Dick!  And there is something\nmore serious, though not concerning that walk with him.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" said Dick, altering his mind about walking to the\nColonies; in fact, passing to the other extreme, and standing so rooted\nto the road that he was apparently not even going home.\n\n\"Why this,\" she said, drying the beginning of a new flood of tears she\nhad been going to shed, \"this is the serious part.  Father has told Mr.\nShiner that he would like him for a son-in-law, if he could get me;--that\nhe has his right hearty consent to come courting me!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV: AN ARRANGEMENT\n\n\n\"That is serious,\" said Dick, more intellectually than he had spoken for\na long time.\n\nThe truth was that Geoffrey knew nothing about his daughter's continued\nwalks and meetings with Dick.  When a hint that there were symptoms of an\nattachment between them had first reached Geoffrey's ears, he stated so\nemphatically that he must think the matter over before any such thing\ncould be allowed that, rather unwisely on Dick's part, whatever it might\nhave been on the lady's, the lovers were careful to be seen together no\nmore in public; and Geoffrey, forgetting the report, did not think over\nthe matter at all.  So Mr. Shiner resumed his old position in Geoffrey's\nbrain by mere flux of time.  Even Shiner began to believe that Dick\nexisted for Fancy no more,--though that remarkably easy-going man had\ntaken no active steps on his own account as yet.\n\n\"And father has not only told Mr. Shiner that,\" continued Fancy, \"but he\nhas written me a letter, to say he should wish me to encourage Mr.\nShiner, if 'twas convenient!\"\n\n\"I must start off and see your father at once!\" said Dick, taking two or\nthree vehement steps to the south, recollecting that Mr. Day lived to the\nnorth, and coming back again.\n\n\"I think we had better see him together.  Not tell him what you come for,\nor anything of the kind, until he likes you, and so win his brain through\nhis heart, which is always the way to manage people.  I mean in this way:\nI am going home on Saturday week to help them in the honey-taking.  You\nmight come there to me, have something to eat and drink, and let him\nguess what your coming signifies, without saying it in so many words.\"\n\n\"We'll do it, dearest.  But I shall ask him for you, flat and plain; not\nwait for his guessing.\"  And the lover then stepped close to her, and\nattempted to give her one little kiss on the cheek, his lips alighting,\nhowever, on an outlying tract of her back hair by reason of an impulse\nthat had caused her to turn her head with a jerk.  \"Yes, and I'll put on\nmy second-best suit and a clean shirt and collar, and black my boots as\nif 'twas a Sunday.  'Twill have a good appearance, you see, and that's a\ngreat deal to start with.\"\n\n\"You won't wear that old waistcoat, will you, Dick?\"\n\n\"Bless you, no!  Why I--\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to be personal, dear Dick,\" she said, fearing she had hurt\nhis feelings.  \"'Tis a very nice waistcoat, but what I meant was, that\nthough it is an excellent waistcoat for a settled-down man, it is not\nquite one for\" (she waited, and a blush expanded over her face, and then\nshe went on again)--\"for going courting in.\"\n\n\"No, I'll wear my best winter one, with the leather lining, that mother\nmade.  It is a beautiful, handsome waistcoat inside, yes, as ever anybody\nsaw.  In fact, only the other day, I unbuttoned it to show a chap that\nvery lining, and he said it was the strongest, handsomest lining you\ncould wish to see on the king's waistcoat himself.\"\n\n\"I don't quite know what to wear,\" she said, as if her habitual\nindifference alone to dress had kept back so important a subject till\nnow.\n\n\"Why, that blue frock you wore last week.\"\n\n\"Doesn't set well round the neck.  I couldn't wear that.\"\n\n\"But I shan't care.\"\n\n\"No, you won't mind.\"\n\n\"Well, then it's all right.  Because you only care how you look to me, do\nyou, dear?  I only dress for you, that's certain.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you see I couldn't appear in it again very well.\"\n\n\"Any strange gentleman you mid meet in your journey might notice the set\nof it, I suppose.  Fancy, men in love don't think so much about how they\nlook to other women.\"  It is difficult to say whether a tone of playful\nbanter or of gentle reproach prevailed in the speech.\n\n\"Well then, Dick,\" she said, with good-humoured frankness, \"I'll own it.\nI shouldn't like a stranger to see me dressed badly, even though I am in\nlove.  'Tis our nature, I suppose.\"\n\n\"You perfect woman!\"\n\n\"Yes; if you lay the stress on 'woman,'\" she murmured, looking at a group\nof hollyhocks in flower, round which a crowd of butterflies had gathered\nlike female idlers round a bonnet-shop.\n\n\"But about the dress.  Why not wear the one you wore at our party?\"\n\n\"That sets well, but a girl of the name of Bet Tallor, who lives near our\nhouse, has had one made almost like it (only in pattern, though of\nmiserably cheap stuff), and I couldn't wear it on that account.  Dear me,\nI am afraid I can't go now.\"\n\n\"O yes, you must; I know you will!\" said Dick, with dismay.  \"Why not\nwear what you've got on?\"\n\n\"What! this old one!  After all, I think that by wearing my gray one\nSaturday, I can make the blue one do for Sunday.  Yes, I will.  A hat or\na bonnet, which shall it be?  Which do I look best in?\"\n\n\"Well, I think the bonnet is nicest, more quiet and matronly.\"\n\n\"What's the objection to the hat?  Does it make me look old?\"\n\n\"O no; the hat is well enough; but it makes you look rather too--you\nwon't mind me saying it, dear?\"\n\n\"Not at all, for I shall wear the bonnet.\"\n\n\"--Rather too coquettish and flirty for an engaged young woman.\"\n\nShe reflected a minute.  \"Yes; yes.  Still, after all, the hat would do\nbest; hats are best, you see.  Yes, I must wear the hat, dear Dicky,\nbecause I ought to wear a hat, you know.\"\n\n\n\n\nPART THE FOURTH--AUTUMN\n\n\nCHAPTER I: GOING NUTTING\n\n\nDick, dressed in his 'second-best' suit, burst into Fancy's sitting-room\nwith a glow of pleasure on his face.\n\nIt was two o'clock on Friday, the day before her contemplated visit to\nher father, and for some reason connected with cleaning the school the\nchildren had been given this Friday afternoon for pastime, in addition to\nthe usual Saturday.\n\n\"Fancy! it happens just right that it is a leisure half day with you.\nSmart is lame in his near-foot-afore, and so, as I can't do anything,\nI've made a holiday afternoon of it, and am come for you to go nutting\nwith me!\"\n\nShe was sitting by the parlour window, with a blue frock lying across her\nlap and scissors in her hand.\n\n\"Go nutting!  Yes.  But I'm afraid I can't go for an hour or so.\"\n\n\"Why not?  'Tis the only spare afternoon we may both have together for\nweeks.\"\n\n\"This dress of mine, that I am going to wear on Sunday at Yalbury;--I\nfind it fits so badly that I must alter it a little, after all.  I told\nthe dressmaker to make it by a pattern I gave her at the time; instead of\nthat, she did it her own way, and made me look a perfect fright.\"\n\n\"How long will you be?\" he inquired, looking rather disappointed.\n\n\"Not long.  Do wait and talk to me; come, do, dear.\"\n\nDick sat down.  The talking progressed very favourably, amid the snipping\nand sewing, till about half-past two, at which time his conversation\nbegan to be varied by a slight tapping upon his toe with a walking-stick\nhe had cut from the hedge as he came along.  Fancy talked and answered\nhim, but sometimes the answers were so negligently given, that it was\nevident her thoughts lay for the greater part in her lap with the blue\ndress.\n\nThe clock struck three.  Dick arose from his seat, walked round the room\nwith his hands behind him, examined all the furniture, then sounded a few\nnotes on the harmonium, then looked inside all the books he could find,\nthen smoothed Fancy's head with his hand.  Still the snipping and sewing\nwent on.\n\nThe clock struck four.  Dick fidgeted about, yawned privately; counted\nthe knots in the table, yawned publicly; counted the flies on the\nceiling, yawned horribly; went into the kitchen and scullery, and so\nthoroughly studied the principle upon which the pump was constructed that\nhe could have delivered a lecture on the subject.  Stepping back to\nFancy, and finding still that she had not done, he went into her garden\nand looked at her cabbages and potatoes, and reminded himself that they\nseemed to him to wear a decidedly feminine aspect; then pulled up several\nweeds, and came in again.  The clock struck five, and still the snipping\nand sewing went on.\n\nDick attempted to kill a fly, peeled all the rind off his walking-stick,\nthen threw the stick into the scullery because it was spoilt, produced\nhideous discords from the harmonium, and accidentally overturned a vase\nof flowers, the water from which ran in a rill across the table and\ndribbled to the floor, where it formed a lake, the shape of which, after\nthe lapse of a few minutes, he began to modify considerably with his\nfoot, till it was like a map of England and Wales.\n\n\"Well, Dick, you needn't have made quite such a mess.\"\n\n\"Well, I needn't, I suppose.\"  He walked up to the blue dress, and looked\nat it with a rigid gaze.  Then an idea seemed to cross his brain.\n\n\"Fancy.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I thought you said you were going to wear your gray gown all day\nto-morrow on your trip to Yalbury, and in the evening too, when I shall\nbe with you, and ask your father for you?\"\n\n\"So I am.\"\n\n\"And the blue one only on Sunday?\"\n\n\"And the blue one Sunday.\"\n\n\"Well, dear, I sha'n't be at Yalbury Sunday to see it.\"\n\n\"No, but I shall walk to Longpuddle church in the afternoon with father,\nand such lots of people will be looking at me there, you know; and it did\nset so badly round the neck.\"\n\n\"I never noticed it, and 'tis like nobody else would.\"\n\n\"They might.\"\n\n\"Then why not wear the gray one on Sunday as well?  'Tis as pretty as the\nblue one.\"\n\n\"I might make the gray one do, certainly.  But it isn't so good; it\ndidn't cost half so much as this one, and besides, it would be the same I\nwore Saturday.\"\n\n\"Then wear the striped one, dear.\"\n\n\"I might.\"\n\n\"Or the dark one.\"\n\n\"Yes, I might; but I want to wear a fresh one they haven't seen.\"\n\n\"I see, I see,\" said Dick, in a voice in which the tones of love were\ndecidedly inconvenienced by a considerable emphasis, his thoughts\nmeanwhile running as follows: \"I, the man she loves best in the world, as\nshe says, am to understand that my poor half-holiday is to be lost,\nbecause she wants to wear on Sunday a gown there is not the slightest\nnecessity for wearing, simply, in fact, to appear more striking than\nusual in the eyes of Longpuddle young men; and I not there, either.\"\n\n\"Then there are three dresses good enough for my eyes, but neither is\ngood enough for the youths of Longpuddle,\" he said.\n\n\"No, not that exactly, Dick.  Still, you see, I do want--to look pretty\nto them--there, that's honest!  But I sha'n't be much longer.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"A quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"Very well; I'll come in in a quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"Why go away?\"\n\n\"I mid as well.\"\n\nHe went out, walked down the road, and sat upon a gate.  Here he\nmeditated and meditated, and the more he meditated the more decidedly did\nhe begin to fume, and the more positive was he that his time had been\nscandalously trifled with by Miss Fancy Day--that, so far from being the\nsimple girl who had never had a sweetheart before, as she had solemnly\nassured him time after time, she was, if not a flirt, a woman who had had\nno end of admirers; a girl most certainly too anxious about her frocks; a\ngirl, whose feelings, though warm, were not deep; a girl who cared a\ngreat deal too much how she appeared in the eyes of other men.  \"What she\nloves best in the world,\" he thought, with an incipient spice of his\nfather's grimness, \"is her hair and complexion.  What she loves next\nbest, her gowns and hats; what she loves next best, myself, perhaps!\"\n\nSuffering great anguish at this disloyalty in himself and harshness to\nhis darling, yet disposed to persevere in it, a horribly cruel thought\ncrossed his mind.  He would not call for her, as he had promised, at the\nend of a quarter of an hour!  Yes, it would be a punishment she well\ndeserved.  Although the best part of the afternoon had been wasted he\nwould go nutting as he had intended, and go by himself.\n\nHe leaped over the gate, and pushed up the lane for nearly two miles,\ntill a winding path called Snail-Creep sloped up a hill and entered a\nhazel copse by a hole like a rabbit's burrow.  In he plunged, vanished\namong the bushes, and in a short time there was no sign of his existence\nupon earth, save an occasional rustling of boughs and snapping of twigs\nin divers points of Grey's Wood.\n\nNever man nutted as Dick nutted that afternoon.  He worked like a galley\nslave.  Half-hour after half-hour passed away, and still he gathered\nwithout ceasing.  At last, when the sun had set, and bunches of nuts\ncould not be distinguished from the leaves which nourished them, he\nshouldered his bag, containing quite two pecks of the finest produce of\nthe wood, about as much use to him as two pecks of stones from the road,\nstrolled down the woodland track, crossed the highway and entered the\nhomeward lane, whistling as he went.\n\nProbably, Miss Fancy Day never before or after stood so low in Mr. Dewy's\nopinion as on that afternoon.  In fact, it is just possible that a few\nmore blue dresses on the Longpuddle young men's account would have\nclarified Dick's brain entirely, and made him once more a free man.\n\nBut Venus had planned other developments, at any rate for the present.\nCuckoo-Lane, the way he pursued, passed over a ridge which rose keenly\nagainst the sky about fifty yards in his van.  Here, upon the bright\nafter-glow about the horizon, was now visible an irregular shape, which\nat first he conceived to be a bough standing a little beyond the line of\nits neighbours.  Then it seemed to move, and, as he advanced still\nfurther, there was no doubt that it was a living being sitting in the\nbank, head bowed on hand.  The grassy margin entirely prevented his\nfootsteps from being heard, and it was not till he was close that the\nfigure recognized him.  Up it sprang, and he was face to face with Fancy.\n\n\"Dick, Dick!  O, is it you, Dick!\"\n\n\"Yes, Fancy,\" said Dick, in a rather repentant tone, and lowering his\nnuts.\n\nShe ran up to him, flung her parasol on the grass, put her little head\nagainst his breast, and then there began a narrative, disjointed by such\na hysterical weeping as was never surpassed for intensity in the whole\nhistory of love.\n\n\"O Dick,\" she sobbed out, \"where have you been away from me?  O, I have\nsuffered agony, and thought you would never come any more!  'Tis cruel,\nDick; no 'tisn't, it is justice!  I've been walking miles and miles up\nand down Grey's Wood, trying to find you, till I was wearied and worn\nout, and I could walk no further, and had come back this far!  O Dick,\ndirectly you were gone, I thought I had offended you and I put down the\ndress; 'tisn't finished now, and I never will finish, it, and I'll wear\nan old one Sunday!  Yes, Dick, I will, because I don't care what I wear\nwhen you are not by my side--ha, you think I do, but I don't!--and I ran\nafter you, and I saw you go up Snail-Creep and not look back once, and\nthen you plunged in, and I after you; but I was too far behind.  O, I did\nwish the horrid bushes had been cut down, so that I could see your dear\nshape again!  And then I called out to you, and nobody answered, and I\nwas afraid to call very loud, lest anybody else should hear me.  Then I\nkept wandering and wandering about, and it was dreadful misery, Dick.  And\nthen I shut my eyes and fell to picturing you looking at some other\nwoman, very pretty and nice, but with no affection or truth in her at\nall, and then imagined you saying to yourself, 'Ah, she's as good as\nFancy, for Fancy told me a story, and was a flirt, and cared for herself\nmore than me, so now I'll have this one for my sweetheart.'  O, you\nwon't, will you, Dick, for I do love you so!\"\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that Dick renounced his freedom there and\nthen, and kissed her ten times over, and promised that no pretty woman of\nthe kind alluded to should ever engross his thoughts; in short, that\nthough he had been vexed with her, all such vexation was past, and that\nhenceforth and for ever it was simply Fancy or death for him.  And then\nthey set about proceeding homewards, very slowly on account of Fancy's\nweariness, she leaning upon his shoulder, and in addition receiving\nsupport from his arm round her waist; though she had sufficiently\nrecovered from her desperate condition to sing to him, 'Why are you\nwandering here, I pray?' during the latter part of their walk.  Nor is it\nnecessary to describe in detail how the bag of nuts was quite forgotten\nuntil three days later, when it was found among the brambles and restored\nempty to Mrs. Dewy, her initials being marked thereon in red cotton; and\nhow she puzzled herself till her head ached upon the question of how on\nearth her meal-bag could have got into Cuckoo-Lane.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II: HONEY-TAKING, AND AFTERWARDS\n\n\nSaturday evening saw Dick Dewy journeying on foot to Yalbury Wood,\naccording to the arrangement with Fancy.\n\nThe landscape being concave, at the going down of the sun everything\nsuddenly assumed a uniform robe of shade.  The evening advanced from\nsunset to dusk long before Dick's arrival, and his progress during the\nlatter portion of his walk through the trees was indicated by the flutter\nof terrified birds that had been roosting over the path.  And in crossing\nthe glades, masses of hot dry air, that had been formed on the hills\nduring the day, greeted his cheeks alternately with clouds of damp night\nair from the valleys.  He reached the keeper-steward's house, where the\ngrass-plot and the garden in front appeared light and pale against the\nunbroken darkness of the grove from which he had emerged, and paused at\nthe garden gate.\n\nHe had scarcely been there a minute when he beheld a sort of procession\nadvancing from the door in his front.  It consisted first of Enoch the\ntrapper, carrying a spade on his shoulder and a lantern dangling in his\nhand; then came Mrs. Day, the light of the lantern revealing that she\nbore in her arms curious objects about a foot long, in the form of Latin\ncrosses (made of lath and brown paper dipped in brimstone--called matches\nby bee-masters); next came Miss Day, with a shawl thrown over her head;\nand behind all, in the gloom, Mr. Frederic Shiner.\n\nDick, in his consternation at finding Shiner present, was at a loss how\nto proceed, and retired under a tree to collect his thoughts.\n\n\"Here I be, Enoch,\" said a voice; and the procession advancing farther,\nthe lantern's rays illuminated the figure of Geoffrey, awaiting their\narrival beside a row of bee-hives, in front of the path.  Taking the\nspade from Enoch, he proceeded to dig two holes in the earth beside the\nhives, the others standing round in a circle, except Mrs. Day, who\ndeposited her matches in the fork of an apple-tree and returned to the\nhouse.  The party remaining were now lit up in front by the lantern in\ntheir midst, their shadows radiating each way upon the garden-plot like\nthe spokes of a wheel.  An apparent embarrassment of Fancy at the\npresence of Shiner caused a silence in the assembly, during which the\npreliminaries of execution were arranged, the matches fixed, the stake\nkindled, the two hives placed over the two holes, and the earth stopped\nround the edges.  Geoffrey then stood erect, and rather more, to\nstraighten his backbone after the digging.\n\n\"They were a peculiar family,\" said Mr. Shiner, regarding the hives\nreflectively.\n\nGeoffrey nodded.\n\n\"Those holes will be the grave of thousands!\" said Fancy.  \"I think 'tis\nrather a cruel thing to do.\"\n\nHer father shook his head.  \"No,\" he said, tapping the hives to shake the\ndead bees from their cells, \"if you suffocate 'em this way, they only die\nonce: if you fumigate 'em in the new way, they come to life again, and\ndie o' starvation; so the pangs o' death be twice upon 'em.\"\n\n\"I incline to Fancy's notion,\" said Mr. Shiner, laughing lightly.\n\n\"The proper way to take honey, so that the bees be neither starved nor\nmurdered, is a puzzling matter,\" said the keeper steadily.\n\n\"I should like never to take it from them,\" said Fancy.\n\n\"But 'tis the money,\" said Enoch musingly.  \"For without money man is a\nshadder!\"\n\nThe lantern-light had disturbed many bees that had escaped from hives\ndestroyed some days earlier, and, demoralized by affliction, were now\ngetting a living as marauders about the doors of other hives.  Several\nflew round the head and neck of Geoffrey; then darted upon him with an\nirritated bizz.\n\nEnoch threw down the lantern, and ran off and pushed his head into a\ncurrant bush; Fancy scudded up the path; and Mr. Shiner floundered away\nhelter-skelter among the cabbages.  Geoffrey stood his ground, unmoved\nand firm as a rock.  Fancy was the first to return, followed by Enoch\npicking up the lantern.  Mr. Shiner still remained invisible.\n\n\"Have the craters stung ye?\" said Enoch to Geoffrey.\n\n\"No, not much--on'y a little here and there,\" he said with leisurely\nsolemnity, shaking one bee out of his shirt sleeve, pulling another from\namong his hair, and two or three more from his neck.  The rest looked on\nduring this proceeding with a complacent sense of being out of it,--much\nas a European nation in a state of internal commotion is watched by its\nneighbours.\n\n\"Are those all of them, father?\" said Fancy, when Geoffrey had pulled\naway five.\n\n\"Almost all,--though I feel one or two more sticking into my shoulder and\nside.  Ah! there's another just begun again upon my backbone.  You lively\nyoung mortals, how did you get inside there?  However, they can't sting\nme many times more, poor things, for they must be getting weak.  They mid\nas well stay in me till bedtime now, I suppose.\"\n\nAs he himself was the only person affected by this arrangement, it seemed\nsatisfactory enough; and after a noise of feet kicking against cabbages\nin a blundering progress among them, the voice of Mr. Shiner was heard\nfrom the darkness in that direction.\n\n\"Is all quite safe again?\"\n\nNo answer being returned to this query, he apparently assumed that he\nmight venture forth, and gradually drew near the lantern again.  The\nhives were now removed from their position over the holes, one being\nhanded to Enoch to carry indoors, and one being taken by Geoffrey\nhimself.\n\n\"Bring hither the lantern, Fancy: the spade can bide.\"\n\nGeoffrey and Enoch then went towards the house, leaving Shiner and Fancy\nstanding side by side on the garden-plot.\n\n\"Allow me,\" said Shiner, stooping for the lantern and seizing it at the\nsame time with Fancy.\n\n\"I can carry it,\" said Fancy, religiously repressing all inclination to\ntrifle.  She had thoroughly considered that subject after the tearful\nexplanation of the bird-catching adventure to Dick, and had decided that\nit would be dishonest in her, as an engaged young woman, to trifle with\nmen's eyes and hands any more.  Finding that Shiner still retained his\nhold of the lantern, she relinquished it, and he, having found her\nretaining it, also let go.  The lantern fell, and was extinguished.  Fancy\nmoved on.\n\n\"Where is the path?\" said Mr. Shiner.\n\n\"Here,\" said Fancy.  \"Your eyes will get used to the dark in a minute or\ntwo.\"\n\n\"Till that time will ye lend me your hand?\"  Fancy gave him the extreme\ntips of her fingers, and they stepped from the plot into the path.\n\n\"You don't accept attentions very freely.\"\n\n\"It depends upon who offers them.\"\n\n\"A fellow like me, for instance.\"  A dead silence.\n\n\"Well, what do you say, Missie?\"\n\n\"It then depends upon how they are offered.\"\n\n\"Not wildly, and yet not careless-like; not purposely, and yet not by\nchance; not too quick nor yet too slow.\"\n\n\"How then?\" said Fancy.\n\n\"Coolly and practically,\" he said.  \"How would that kind of love be\ntaken?\"\n\n\"Not anxiously, and yet not indifferently; neither blushing nor pale; nor\nreligiously nor yet quite wickedly.\"\n\n\"Well, how?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nGeoffrey Day's storehouse at the back of his dwelling was hung with\nbunches of dried horehound, mint, and sage; brown-paper bags of thyme and\nlavender; and long ropes of clean onions.  On shelves were spread large\nred and yellow apples, and choice selections of early potatoes for seed\nnext year;--vulgar crowds of commoner kind lying beneath in heaps.  A few\nempty beehives were clustered around a nail in one corner, under which\nstood two or three barrels of new cider of the first crop, each bubbling\nand squirting forth from the yet open bunghole.\n\nFancy was now kneeling beside the two inverted hives, one of which rested\nagainst her lap, for convenience in operating upon the contents.  She\nthrust her sleeves above her elbows, and inserted her small pink hand\nedgewise between each white lobe of honeycomb, performing the act so\nadroitly and gently as not to unseal a single cell.  Then cracking the\npiece off at the crown of the hive by a slight backward and forward\nmovement, she lifted each portion as it was loosened into a large blue\nplatter, placed on a bench at her side.\n\n\"Bother these little mortals!\" said Geoffrey, who was holding the light\nto her, and giving his back an uneasy twist.  \"I really think I may as\nwell go indoors and take 'em out, poor things! for they won't let me\nalone.  There's two a stinging wi' all their might now.  I'm sure I\nwonder their strength can last so long.\"\n\n\"All right, friend; I'll hold the candle whilst you are gone,\" said Mr.\nShiner, leisurely taking the light, and allowing Geoffrey to depart,\nwhich he did with his usual long paces.\n\nHe could hardly have gone round to the house-door when other footsteps\nwere heard approaching the outbuilding; the tip of a finger appeared in\nthe hole through which the wood latch was lifted, and Dick Dewy came in,\nhaving been all this time walking up and down the wood, vainly waiting\nfor Shiner's departure.\n\nFancy looked up and welcomed him rather confusedly.  Shiner grasped the\ncandlestick more firmly, and, lest doing this in silence should not imply\nto Dick with sufficient force that he was quite at home and cool, he sang\ninvincibly--\n\n   \"'King Arthur he had three sons.'\"\n\n\"Father here?\" said Dick.\n\n\"Indoors, I think,\" said Fancy, looking pleasantly at him.\n\nDick surveyed the scene, and did not seem inclined to hurry off just at\nthat moment.  Shiner went on singing--\n\n   \"'The miller was drown'd in his pond,\n      The weaver was hung in his yarn,\n   And the d--- ran away with the little tail-or,\n      With the broadcloth under his arm.'\"\n\n\"That's a terrible crippled rhyme, if that's your rhyme!\" said Dick, with\na grain of superciliousness in his tone.\n\n\"It's no use your complaining to me about the rhyme!\" said Mr. Shiner.\n\"You must go to the man that made it.\"\n\nFancy by this time had acquired confidence.\n\n\"Taste a bit, Mr. Dewy,\" she said, holding up to him a small circular\npiece of honeycomb that had been the last in the row of layers, remaining\nstill on her knees and flinging back her head to look in his face; \"and\nthen I'll taste a bit too.\"\n\n\"And I, if you please,\" said Mr. Shiner.  Nevertheless the farmer looked\nsuperior, as if he could even now hardly join the trifling from very\nimportance of station; and after receiving the honeycomb from Fancy, he\nturned it over in his hand till the cells began to be crushed, and the\nliquid honey ran down from his fingers in a thin string.\n\nSuddenly a faint cry from Fancy caused them to gaze at her.\n\n\"What's the matter, dear?\" said Dick.\n\n\"It is nothing, but O-o! a bee has stung the inside of my lip!  He was in\none of the cells I was eating!\"\n\n\"We must keep down the swelling, or it may be serious!\" said Shiner,\nstepping up and kneeling beside her.  \"Let me see it.\"\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\n\"Just let me see it,\" said Dick, kneeling on the other side: and after\nsome hesitation she pressed down her lip with one finger to show the\nplace.  \"O, I hope 'twill soon be better!  I don't mind a sting in\nordinary places, but it is so bad upon your lip,\" she added with tears in\nher eyes, and writhing a little from the pain.\n\nShiner held the light above his head and pushed his face close to\nFancy's, as if the lip had been shown exclusively to himself, upon which\nDick pushed closer, as if Shiner were not there at all.\n\n\"It is swelling,\" said Dick to her right aspect.\n\n\"It isn't swelling,\" said Shiner to her left aspect.\n\n\"Is it dangerous on the lip?\" cried Fancy.  \"I know it is dangerous on\nthe tongue.\"\n\n\"O no, not dangerous!\" answered Dick.\n\n\"Rather dangerous,\" had answered Shiner simultaneously.\n\n\"I must try to bear it!\" said Fancy, turning again to the hives.\n\n\"Hartshorn-and-oil is a good thing to put to it, Miss Day,\" said Shiner\nwith great concern.\n\n\"Sweet-oil-and-hartshorn I've found to be a good thing to cure stings,\nMiss Day,\" said Dick with greater concern.\n\n\"We have some mixed indoors; would you kindly run and get it for me?\" she\nsaid.\n\nNow, whether by inadvertence, or whether by mischievous intention, the\nindividuality of the you was so carelessly denoted that both Dick and\nShiner sprang to their feet like twin acrobats, and marched abreast to\nthe door; both seized the latch and lifted it, and continued marching on,\nshoulder to shoulder, in the same manner to the dwelling-house.  Not only\nso, but entering the room, they marched as before straight up to Mrs.\nDay's chair, letting the door in the oak partition slam so forcibly, that\nthe rows of pewter on the dresser rang like a bell.\n\n\"Mrs. Day, Fancy has stung her lip, and wants you to give me the\nhartshorn, please,\" said Mr. Shiner, very close to Mrs. Day's face.\n\n\"O, Mrs. Day, Fancy has asked me to bring out the hartshorn, please,\nbecause she has stung her lip!\" said Dick, a little closer to Mrs. Day's\nface.\n\n\"Well, men alive! that's no reason why you should eat me, I suppose!\"\nsaid Mrs. Day, drawing back.\n\nShe searched in the corner-cupboard, produced the bottle, and began to\ndust the cork, the rim, and every other part very carefully, Dick's hand\nand Shiner's hand waiting side by side.\n\n\"Which is head man?\" said Mrs. Day.  \"Now, don't come mumbudgeting so\nclose again.  Which is head man?\"\n\nNeither spoke; and the bottle was inclined towards Shiner.  Shiner, as a\nhigh-class man, would not look in the least triumphant, and turned to go\noff with it as Geoffrey came downstairs after the search in his linen for\nconcealed bees.\n\n\"O--that you, Master Dewy?\"\n\nDick assured the keeper that it was; and the young man then determined\nupon a bold stroke for the attainment of his end, forgetting that the\nworst of bold strokes is the disastrous consequences they involve if they\nfail.\n\n\"I've come on purpose to speak to you very particular, Mr. Day,\" he said,\nwith a crushing emphasis intended for the ears of Mr. Shiner, who was\nvanishing round the door-post at that moment.\n\n\"Well, I've been forced to go upstairs and unrind myself, and shake some\nbees out o' me\" said Geoffrey, walking slowly towards the open door, and\nstanding on the threshold.  \"The young rascals got into my shirt and\nwouldn't be quiet nohow.\"\n\nDick followed him to the door.\n\n\"I've come to speak a word to you,\" he repeated, looking out at the pale\nmist creeping up from the gloom of the valley.  \"You may perhaps guess\nwhat it is about.\"\n\nThe keeper lowered his hands into the depths of his pockets, twirled his\neyes, balanced himself on his toes, looked as perpendicularly downward as\nif his glance were a plumb-line, then horizontally, collecting together\nthe cracks that lay about his face till they were all in the\nneighbourhood of his eyes.\n\n\"Maybe I don't know,\" he replied.\n\nDick said nothing; and the stillness was disturbed only by some small\nbird that was being killed by an owl in the adjoining wood, whose cry\npassed into the silence without mingling with it.\n\n\"I've left my hat up in chammer,\" said Geoffrey; \"wait while I step up\nand get en.\"\n\n\"I'll be in the garden,\" said Dick.\n\nHe went round by a side wicket into the garden, and Geoffrey went\nupstairs.  It was the custom in Mellstock and its vicinity to discuss\nmatters of pleasure and ordinary business inside the house, and to\nreserve the garden for very important affairs: a custom which, as is\nsupposed, originated in the desirability of getting away at such times\nfrom the other members of the family when there was only one room for\nliving in, though it was now quite as frequently practised by those who\nsuffered from no such limitation to the size of their domiciles.\n\nThe head-keeper's form appeared in the dusky garden, and Dick walked\ntowards him.  The elder paused and leant over the rail of a piggery that\nstood on the left of the path, upon which Dick did the same; and they\nboth contemplated a whitish shadowy shape that was moving about and\ngrunting among the straw of the interior.\n\n\"I've come to ask for Fancy,\" said Dick.\n\n\"I'd as lief you hadn't.\"\n\n\"Why should that be, Mr. Day?\"\n\n\"Because it makes me say that you've come to ask what ye be'n't likely to\nhave.  Have ye come for anything else?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Then I'll just tell 'ee you've come on a very foolish errand.  D'ye know\nwhat her mother was?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A teacher in a landed family's nursery, who was foolish enough to marry\nthe keeper of the same establishment; for I was only a keeper then,\nthough now I've a dozen other irons in the fire as steward here for my\nlord, what with the timber sales and the yearly fellings, and the gravel\nand sand sales and one thing and 'tother.  However, d'ye think Fancy\npicked up her good manners, the smooth turn of her tongue, her musical\nnotes, and her knowledge of books, in a homely hole like this?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"D'ye know where?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, when I went a-wandering after her mother's death, she lived with\nher aunt, who kept a boarding-school, till her aunt married Lawyer\nGreen--a man as sharp as a needle--and the school was broke up.  Did ye\nknow that then she went to the training-school, and that her name stood\nfirst among the Queen's scholars of her year?\"\n\n\"I've heard so.\"\n\n\"And that when she sat for her certificate as Government teacher, she had\nthe highest of the first class?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, and do ye know what I live in such a miserly way for when I've got\nenough to do without it, and why I make her work as a schoolmistress\ninstead of living here?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That if any gentleman, who sees her to be his equal in polish, should\nwant to marry her, and she want to marry him, he sha'n't be superior to\nher in pocket.  Now do ye think after this that you be good enough for\nher?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then good-night t'ee, Master Dewy.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Mr. Day.\"\n\nModest Dick's reply had faltered upon his tongue, and he turned away\nwondering at his presumption in asking for a woman whom he had seen from\nthe beginning to be so superior to him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III: FANCY IN THE RAIN\n\n\nThe next scene is a tempestuous afternoon in the following month, and\nFancy Day is discovered walking from her father's home towards Mellstock.\n\nA single vast gray cloud covered the country, from which the small rain\nand mist had just begun to blow down in wavy sheets, alternately thick\nand thin.  The trees of the fields and plantations writhed like miserable\nmen as the air wound its way swiftly among them: the lowest portions of\ntheir trunks, that had hardly ever been known to move, were visibly\nrocked by the fiercer gusts, distressing the mind by its painful\nunwontedness, as when a strong man is seen to shed tears.  Low-hanging\nboughs went up and down; high and erect boughs went to and fro; the\nblasts being so irregular, and divided into so many cross-currents, that\nneighbouring branches of the same tree swept the skies in independent\nmotions, crossed each other, or became entangled.  Across the open spaces\nflew flocks of green and yellowish leaves, which, after travelling a long\ndistance from their parent trees, reached the ground, and lay there with\ntheir under-sides upward.\n\nAs the rain and wind increased, and Fancy's bonnet-ribbons leapt more and\nmore snappishly against her chin, she paused on entering Mellstock Lane\nto consider her latitude, and the distance to a place of shelter.  The\nnearest house was Elizabeth Endorfield's, in Higher Mellstock, whose\ncottage and garden stood not far from the junction of that hamlet with\nthe road she followed.  Fancy hastened onward, and in five minutes\nentered a gate, which shed upon her toes a flood of water-drops as she\nopened it.\n\n\"Come in, chiel!\" a voice exclaimed, before Fancy had knocked: a\npromptness that would have surprised her had she not known that Mrs.\nEndorfield was an exceedingly and exceptionally sharp woman in the use of\nher eyes and ears.\n\nFancy went in and sat down.  Elizabeth was paring potatoes for her\nhusband's supper.\n\nScrape, scrape, scrape; then a toss, and splash went a potato into a\nbucket of water.\n\nNow, as Fancy listlessly noted these proceedings of the dame, she began\nto reconsider an old subject that lay uppermost in her heart.  Since the\ninterview between her father and Dick, the days had been melancholy days\nfor her.  Geoffrey's firm opposition to the notion of Dick as a son-in-\nlaw was more than she had expected.  She had frequently seen her lover\nsince that time, it is true, and had loved him more for the opposition\nthan she would have otherwise dreamt of doing--which was a happiness of a\ncertain kind.  Yet, though love is thus an end in itself, it must be\nbelieved to be the means to another end if it is to assume the rosy hues\nof an unalloyed pleasure.  And such a belief Fancy and Dick were\nemphatically denied just now.\n\nElizabeth Endorfield had a repute among women which was in its nature\nsomething between distinction and notoriety.  It was founded on the\nfollowing items of character.  She was shrewd and penetrating; her house\nstood in a lonely place; she never went to church; she wore a red cloak;\nshe always retained her bonnet indoors and she had a pointed chin.  Thus\nfar her attributes were distinctly Satanic; and those who looked no\nfurther called her, in plain terms, a witch.  But she was not gaunt, nor\nugly in the upper part of her face, nor particularly strange in manner;\nso that, when her more intimate acquaintances spoke of her the term was\nsoftened, and she became simply a Deep Body, who was as long-headed as\nshe was high.  It may be stated that Elizabeth belonged to a class of\nsuspects who were gradually losing their mysterious characteristics under\nthe administration of the young vicar; though, during the long reign of\nMr. Grinham, the parish of Mellstock had proved extremely favourable to\nthe growth of witches.\n\nWhile Fancy was revolving all this in her mind, and putting it to herself\nwhether it was worth while to tell her troubles to Elizabeth, and ask her\nadvice in getting out of them, the witch spoke.\n\n\"You be down--proper down,\" she said suddenly, dropping another potato\ninto the bucket.\n\nFancy took no notice.\n\n\"About your young man.\"\n\nFancy reddened.  Elizabeth seemed to be watching her thoughts.  Really,\none would almost think she must have the powers people ascribed to her.\n\n\"Father not in the humour for't, hey?\"  Another potato was finished and\nflung in.  \"Ah, I know about it.  Little birds tell me things that people\ndon't dream of my knowing.\"\n\nFancy was desperate about Dick, and here was a chance--O, such a wicked\nchance--of getting help; and what was goodness beside love!\n\n\"I wish you'd tell me how to put him in the humour for it?\" she said.\n\n\"That I could soon do,\" said the witch quietly.\n\n\"Really?  O, do; anyhow--I don't care--so that it is done!  How could I\ndo it, Mrs. Endorfield?\"\n\n\"Nothing so mighty wonderful in it.\"\n\n\"Well, but how?\"\n\n\"By witchery, of course!\" said Elizabeth.\n\n\"No!\" said Fancy.\n\n\"'Tis, I assure ye.  Didn't you ever hear I was a witch?\"\n\n\"Well,\" hesitated Fancy, \"I have heard you called so.\"\n\n\"And you believed it?\"\n\n\"I can't say that I did exactly believe it, for 'tis very horrible and\nwicked; but, O, how I do wish it was possible for you to be one!\"\n\n\"So I am.  And I'll tell you how to bewitch your father to let you marry\nDick Dewy.\"\n\n\"Will it hurt him, poor thing?\"\n\n\"Hurt who?\"\n\n\"Father.\"\n\n\"No; the charm is worked by common sense, and the spell can only be broke\nby your acting stupidly.\"\n\nFancy looked rather perplexed, and Elizabeth went on:\n\n   \"This fear of Lizz--whatever 'tis--\n   By great and small;\n   She makes pretence to common sense,\n   And that's all.\n\n\"You must do it like this.\"  The witch laid down her knife and potato,\nand then poured into Fancy's ear a long and detailed list of directions,\nglancing up from the corner of her eye into Fancy's face with an\nexpression of sinister humour.  Fancy's face brightened, clouded, rose\nand sank, as the narrative proceeded.  \"There,\" said Elizabeth at length,\nstooping for the knife and another potato, \"do that, and you'll have him\nby-long and by-late, my dear.\"\n\n\"And do it I will!\" said Fancy.\n\nShe then turned her attention to the external world once more.  The rain\ncontinued as usual, but the wind had abated considerably during the\ndiscourse.  Judging that it was now possible to keep an umbrella erect,\nshe pulled her hood again over her bonnet, bade the witch good-bye, and\nwent her way.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV: THE SPELL\n\n\nMrs. Endorfield's advice was duly followed.\n\n\"I be proper sorry that your daughter isn't so well as she might be,\"\nsaid a Mellstock man to Geoffrey one morning.\n\n\"But is there anything in it?\" said Geoffrey uneasily, as he shifted his\nhat to the right.  \"I can't understand the report.  She didn't complain\nto me a bit when I saw her.\"\n\n\"No appetite at all, they say.\"\n\nGeoffrey crossed to Mellstock and called at the school that afternoon.\nFancy welcomed him as usual, and asked him to stay and take tea with her.\n\n\"I be'n't much for tea, this time o' day,\" he said, but stayed.\n\nDuring the meal he watched her narrowly.  And to his great consternation\ndiscovered the following unprecedented change in the healthy girl--that\nshe cut herself only a diaphanous slice of bread-and-butter, and, laying\nit on her plate, passed the meal-time in breaking it into pieces, but\neating no more than about one-tenth of the slice.  Geoffrey hoped she\nwould say something about Dick, and finish up by weeping, as she had done\nafter the decision against him a few days subsequent to the interview in\nthe garden.  But nothing was said, and in due time Geoffrey departed\nagain for Yalbury Wood.\n\n\"'Tis to be hoped poor Miss Fancy will be able to keep on her school,\"\nsaid Geoffrey's man Enoch to Geoffrey the following week, as they were\nshovelling up ant-hills in the wood.\n\nGeoffrey stuck in the shovel, swept seven or eight ants from his sleeve,\nand killed another that was prowling round his ear, then looked\nperpendicularly into the earth as usual, waiting for Enoch to say more.\n\"Well, why shouldn't she?\" said the keeper at last.\n\n\"The baker told me yesterday,\" continued Enoch, shaking out another emmet\nthat had run merrily up his thigh, \"that the bread he've left at that\nthere school-house this last month would starve any mouse in the three\ncreations; that 'twould so!  And afterwards I had a pint o' small down at\nMorrs's, and there I heard more.\"\n\n\"What might that ha' been?\"\n\n\"That she used to have a pound o' the best rolled butter a week, regular\nas clockwork, from Dairyman Viney's for herself, as well as just so much\nsalted for the helping girl, and the 'ooman she calls in; but now the\nsame quantity d'last her three weeks, and then 'tis thoughted she throws\nit away sour.\"\n\n\"Finish doing the emmets, and carry the bag home-along.\"  The keeper\nresumed his gun, tucked it under his arm, and went on without whistling\nto the dogs, who however followed, with a bearing meant to imply that\nthey did not expect any such attentions when their master was reflecting.\n\nOn Saturday morning a note came from Fancy.  He was not to trouble about\nsending her the couple of rabbits, as was intended, because she feared\nshe should not want them.  Later in the day Geoffrey went to Casterbridge\nand called upon the butcher who served Fancy with fresh meat, which was\nput down to her father's account.\n\n\"I've called to pay up our little bill, Neighbour Haylock, and you can\ngie me the chiel's account at the same time.\"\n\nMr. Haylock turned round three quarters of a circle in the midst of a\nheap of joints, altered the expression of his face from meat to money,\nwent into a little office consisting only of a door and a window, looked\nvery vigorously into a book which possessed length but no breadth; and\nthen, seizing a piece of paper and scribbling thereupon, handed the bill.\n\nProbably it was the first time in the history of commercial transactions\nthat the quality of shortness in a butcher's bill was a cause of\ntribulation to the debtor.  \"Why, this isn't all she've had in a whole\nmonth!\" said Geoffrey.\n\n\"Every mossel,\" said the butcher--\"(now, Dan, take that leg and shoulder\nto Mrs. White's, and this eleven pound here to Mr. Martin's)--you've been\ntreating her to smaller joints lately, to my thinking, Mr. Day?\"\n\n\"Only two or three little scram rabbits this last week, as I am alive--I\nwish I had!\"\n\n\"Well, my wife said to me--(Dan! not too much, not too much on that tray\nat a time; better go twice)--my wife said to me as she posted up the\nbooks: she says, 'Miss Day must have been affronted this summer during\nthat hot muggy weather that spolit so much for us; for depend upon't,'\nshe says, 'she've been trying John Grimmett unknown to us: see her\naccount else.'  'Tis little, of course, at the best of times, being only\nfor one, but now 'tis next kin to nothing.\"\n\n\"I'll inquire,\" said Geoffrey despondingly.\n\nHe returned by way of Mellstock, and called upon Fancy, in fulfilment of\na promise.  It being Saturday, the children were enjoying a holiday, and\non entering the residence Fancy was nowhere to be seen.  Nan, the\ncharwoman, was sweeping the kitchen.\n\n\"Where's my da'ter?\" said the keeper.\n\n\"Well, you see she was tired with the week's teaching, and this morning\nshe said, 'Nan, I sha'n't get up till the evening.'  You see, Mr. Day, if\npeople don't eat, they can't work; and as she've gie'd up eating, she\nmust gie up working.\"\n\n\"Have ye carried up any dinner to her?\"\n\n\"No; she don't want any.  There, we all know that such things don't come\nwithout good reason--not that I wish to say anything about a broken\nheart, or anything of the kind.\"\n\nGeoffrey's own heart felt inconveniently large just then.  He went to the\nstaircase and ascended to his daughter's door.\n\n\"Fancy!\"\n\n\"Come in, father.\"\n\nTo see a person in bed from any cause whatever, on a fine afternoon, is\ndepressing enough; and here was his only child Fancy, not only in bed,\nbut looking very pale.  Geoffrey was visibly disturbed.\n\n\"Fancy, I didn't expect to see thee here, chiel,\" he said.  \"What's the\nmatter?\"\n\n\"I'm not well, father.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"Because I think of things.\"\n\n\"What things can you have to think o' so mortal much?\"\n\n\"You know, father.\"\n\n\"You think I've been cruel to thee in saying that that penniless Dick o'\nthine sha'n't marry thee, I suppose?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Well, you know, Fancy, I do it for the best, and he isn't good enough\nfor thee.  You know that well enough.\"  Here he again looked at her as\nshe lay.  \"Well, Fancy, I can't let my only chiel die; and if you can't\nlive without en, you must ha' en, I suppose.\"\n\n\"O, I don't want him like that; all against your will, and everything so\ndisobedient!\" sighed the invalid.\n\n\"No, no, 'tisn't against my will.  My wish is, now I d'see how 'tis\nhurten thee to live without en, that he shall marry thee as soon as we've\nconsidered a little.  That's my wish flat and plain, Fancy.  There, never\ncry, my little maid!  You ought to ha' cried afore; no need o' crying now\n'tis all over.  Well, howsoever, try to step over and see me and mother-\nlaw to-morrow, and ha' a bit of dinner wi' us.\"\n\n\"And--Dick too?\"\n\n\"Ay, Dick too, 'far's I know.\"\n\n\"And when do you think you'll have considered, father, and he may marry\nme?\" she coaxed.\n\n\"Well, there, say next Midsummer; that's not a day too long to wait.\"\n\nOn leaving the school Geoffrey went to the tranter's.  Old William opened\nthe door.\n\n\"Is your grandson Dick in 'ithin, William?\"\n\n\"No, not just now, Mr. Day.  Though he've been at home a good deal\nlately.\"\n\n\"O, how's that?\"\n\n\"What wi' one thing, and what wi' t'other, he's all in a mope, as might\nbe said.  Don't seem the feller he used to.  Ay, 'a will sit studding and\nthinking as if 'a were going to turn chapel-member, and then do nothing\nbut traypse and wamble about.  Used to be such a chatty boy, too, Dick\ndid; and now 'a don't speak at all.  But won't ye step inside?  Reuben\nwill be home soon, 'a b'lieve.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I can't stay now.  Will ye just ask Dick if he'll do me\nthe kindness to step over to Yalbury to-morrow with my da'ter Fancy, if\nshe's well enough?  I don't like her to come by herself, now she's not so\nterrible topping in health.\"\n\n\"So I've heard.  Ay, sure, I'll tell him without fail.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V: AFTER GAINING HER POINT\n\n\nThe visit to Geoffrey passed off as delightfully as a visit might have\nbeen expected to pass off when it was the first day of smooth experience\nin a hitherto obstructed love-course.  And then came a series of several\nhappy days, of the same undisturbed serenity.  Dick could court her when\nhe chose; stay away when he chose,--which was never; walk with her by\nwinding streams and waterfalls and autumn scenery till dews and twilight\nsent them home.  And thus they drew near the day of the Harvest\nThanksgiving, which was also the time chosen for opening the organ in\nMellstock Church.\n\nIt chanced that Dick on that very day was called away from Mellstock.  A\nyoung acquaintance had died of consumption at Charmley, a neighbouring\nvillage, on the previous Monday, and Dick, in fulfilment of a\nlong-standing promise, was to assist in carrying him to the grave.  When\non Tuesday, Dick went towards the school to acquaint Fancy with the fact,\nit is difficult to say whether his own disappointment at being denied the\nsight of her triumphant debut as organist, was greater than his vexation\nthat his pet should on this great occasion be deprived of the pleasure of\nhis presence.  However, the intelligence was communicated.  She bore it\nas she best could, not without many expressions of regret, and\nconvictions that her performance would be nothing to her now.\n\nJust before eleven o'clock on Sunday he set out upon his sad errand.  The\nfuneral was to be immediately after the morning service, and as there\nwere four good miles to walk, driving being inconvenient, it became\nnecessary to start comparatively early.  Half an hour later would\ncertainly have answered his purpose quite as well, yet at the last moment\nnothing would content his ardent mind but that he must go a mile out of\nhis way in the direction of the school, in the hope of getting a glimpse\nof his Love as she started for church.\n\nStriking, therefore, into the lane towards the school, instead of across\nthe ewelease direct to Charmley, he arrived opposite her door as his\ngoddess emerged.\n\nIf ever a woman looked a divinity, Fancy Day appeared one that morning as\nshe floated down those school steps, in the form of a nebulous collection\nof colours inclining to blue.  With an audacity unparalleled in the whole\nhistory of village-school-mistresses at this date--partly owing, no\ndoubt, to papa's respectable accumulation of cash, which rendered her\nprofession not altogether one of necessity--she had actually donned a hat\nand feather, and lowered her hitherto plainly looped-up hair, which now\nfell about her shoulders in a profusion of curls.  Poor Dick was\nastonished: he had never seen her look so distractingly beautiful before,\nsave on Christmas-eve, when her hair was in the same luxuriant condition\nof freedom.  But his first burst of delighted surprise was followed by\nless comfortable feelings, as soon as his brain recovered its power to\nthink.\n\nFancy had blushed;--was it with confusion?  She had also involuntarily\npressed back her curls.  She had not expected him.\n\n\"Fancy, you didn't know me for a moment in my funeral clothes, did you?\"\n\n\"Good-morning, Dick--no, really, I didn't know you for an instant in such\na sad suit.\"\n\nHe looked again at the gay tresses and hat.  \"You've never dressed so\ncharming before, dearest.\"\n\n\"I like to hear you praise me in that way, Dick,\" she said, smiling\narchly.  \"It is meat and drink to a woman.  Do I look nice really?\"\n\n\"Fie! you know it.  Did you remember,--I mean didn't you remember about\nmy going away to-day?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, I did, Dick; but, you know, I wanted to look well;--forgive\nme.\"\n\n\"Yes, darling; yes, of course,--there's nothing to forgive.  No, I was\nonly thinking that when we talked on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday\nand Friday about my absence to-day, and I was so sorry for it, you said,\nFancy, so were you sorry, and almost cried, and said it would be no\npleasure to you to be the attraction of the church to-day, since I could\nnot be there.\"\n\n\"My dear one, neither will it be so much pleasure to me . . . But I do\ntake a little delight in my life, I suppose,\" she pouted.\n\n\"Apart from mine?\"\n\nShe looked at him with perplexed eyes.  \"I know you are vexed with me,\nDick, and it is because the first Sunday I have curls and a hat and\nfeather since I have been here happens to be the very day you are away\nand won't be with me.  Yes, say it is, for that is it!  And you think\nthat all this week I ought to have remembered you wouldn't be here to-\nday, and not have cared to be better dressed than usual.  Yes, you do,\nDick, and it is rather unkind!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Dick earnestly and simply, \"I didn't think so badly of you\nas that.  I only thought that--if you had been going away, I shouldn't\nhave tried new attractions for the eyes of other people.  But then of\ncourse you and I are different, naturally.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps we are.\"\n\n\"Whatever will the vicar say, Fancy?\"\n\n\"I don't fear what he says in the least!\" she answered proudly.  \"But he\nwon't say anything of the sort you think.  No, no.\"\n\n\"He can hardly have conscience to, indeed.\"\n\n\"Now come, you say, Dick, that you quite forgive me, for I must go,\" she\nsaid with sudden gaiety, and skipped backwards into the porch.  \"Come\nhere, sir;--say you forgive me, and then you shall kiss me;--you never\nhave yet when I have worn curls, you know.  Yes, just where you want to\nso much,--yes, you may!\"\n\nDick followed her into the inner corner, where he was probably not slow\nin availing himself of the privilege offered.\n\n\"Now that's a treat for you, isn't it?\" she continued.  \"Good-bye, or I\nshall be late.  Come and see me to-morrow: you'll be tired to-night.\"\n\nThus they parted, and Fancy proceeded to the church.  The organ stood on\none side of the chancel, close to and under the immediate eye of the\nvicar when he was in the pulpit, and also in full view of the\ncongregation.  Here she sat down, for the first time in such a\nconspicuous position, her seat having previously been in a remote spot in\nthe aisle.\n\n\"Good heavens--disgraceful!  Curls and a hat and feather!\" said the\ndaughters of the small gentry, who had either only curly hair without a\nhat and feather, or a hat and feather without curly hair.  \"A bonnet for\nchurch always,\" said sober matrons.\n\nThat Mr. Maybold was conscious of her presence close beside him during\nthe sermon; that he was not at all angry at her development of costume;\nthat he admired her, she perceived.  But she did not see that he loved\nher during that sermon-time as he had never loved a woman before; that\nher proximity was a strange delight to him; and that he gloried in her\nmusical success that morning in a spirit quite beyond a mere cleric's\nglory at the inauguration of a new order of things.\n\nThe old choir, with humbled hearts, no longer took their seats in the\ngallery as heretofore (which was now given up to the school-children who\nwere not singers, and a pupil-teacher), but were scattered about with\ntheir wives in different parts of the church.  Having nothing to do with\nconducting the service for almost the first time in their lives, they all\nfelt awkward, out of place, abashed, and inconvenienced by their hands.\nThe tranter had proposed that they should stay away to-day and go\nnutting, but grandfather William would not hear of such a thing for a\nmoment.  \"No,\" he replied reproachfully, and quoted a verse: \"Though this\nhas come upon us, let not our hearts be turned back, or our steps go out\nof the way.\"\n\nSo they stood and watched the curls of hair trailing down the back of the\nsuccessful rival, and the waving of her feather, as she swayed her head.\nAfter a few timid notes and uncertain touches her playing became markedly\ncorrect, and towards the end full and free.  But, whether from prejudice\nor unbiassed judgment, the venerable body of musicians could not help\nthinking that the simpler notes they had been wont to bring forth were\nmore in keeping with the simplicity of their old church than the crowded\nchords and interludes it was her pleasure to produce.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI: INTO TEMPTATION\n\n\nThe day was done, and Fancy was again in the school-house.  About five\no'clock it began to rain, and in rather a dull frame of mind she wandered\ninto the schoolroom, for want of something better to do.  She was\nthinking--of her lover Dick Dewy?  Not precisely.  Of how weary she was\nof living alone: how unbearable it would be to return to Yalbury under\nthe rule of her strange-tempered step-mother; that it was far better to\nbe married to anybody than do that; that eight or nine long months had\nyet to be lived through ere the wedding could take place.\n\nAt the side of the room were high windows of Ham-hill stone, upon either\nsill of which she could sit by first mounting a desk and using it as a\nfootstool.  As the evening advanced here she perched herself, as was her\ncustom on such wet and gloomy occasions, put on a light shawl and bonnet,\nopened the window, and looked out at the rain.\n\nThe window overlooked a field called the Grove, and it was the position\nfrom which she used to survey the crown of Dick's passing hat in the\nearly days of their acquaintance and meetings.  Not a living soul was now\nvisible anywhere; the rain kept all people indoors who were not forced\nabroad by necessity, and necessity was less importunate on Sundays than\nduring the week.\n\nSitting here and thinking again--of her lover, or of the sensation she\nhad created at church that day?--well, it is unknown--thinking and\nthinking she saw a dark masculine figure arising into distinctness at the\nfurther end of the Grove--a man without an umbrella.  Nearer and nearer\nhe came, and she perceived that he was in deep mourning, and then that it\nwas Dick.  Yes, in the fondness and foolishness of his young heart, after\nwalking four miles, in a drizzling rain without overcoat or umbrella, and\nin face of a remark from his love that he was not to come because he\nwould be tired, he had made it his business to wander this mile out of\nhis way again, from sheer wish of spending ten minutes in her presence.\n\n\"O Dick, how wet you are!\" she said, as he drew up under the window.\n\"Why, your coat shines as if it had been varnished, and your hat--my\ngoodness, there's a streaming hat!\"\n\n\"O, I don't mind, darling!\" said Dick cheerfully.  \"Wet never hurts me,\nthough I am rather sorry for my best clothes.  However, it couldn't be\nhelped; we lent all the umbrellas to the women.  I don't know when I\nshall get mine back!\"\n\n\"And look, there's a nasty patch of something just on your shoulder.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's japanning; it rubbed off the clamps of poor Jack's coffin\nwhen we lowered him from our shoulders upon the bier!  I don't care about\nthat, for 'twas the last deed I could do for him; and 'tis hard if you\ncan't afford a coat for an old friend.\"\n\nFancy put her hand to her mouth for half a minute.  Underneath the palm\nof that little hand there existed for that half-minute a little yawn.\n\n\"Dick, I don't like you to stand there in the wet.  And you mustn't sit\ndown.  Go home and change your things.  Don't stay another minute.\"\n\n\"One kiss after coming so far,\" he pleaded.\n\n\"If I can reach, then.\"\n\nHe looked rather disappointed at not being invited round to the door.  She\ntwisted from her seated position and bent herself downwards, but not even\nby standing on the plinth was it possible for Dick to get his lips into\ncontact with hers as she held them.  By great exertion she might have\nreached a little lower; but then she would have exposed her head to the\nrain.\n\n\"Never mind, Dick; kiss my hand,\" she said, flinging it down to him.\n\"Now, good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye.\"\n\nHe walked slowly away, turning and turning again to look at her till he\nwas out of sight.  During the retreat she said to herself, almost\ninvoluntarily, and still conscious of that morning's triumph--\"I like\nDick, and I love him; but how plain and sorry a man looks in the rain,\nwith no umbrella, and wet through!\"\n\nAs he vanished, she made as if to descend from her seat; but glancing in\nthe other direction she saw another form coming along the same track.  It\nwas also that of a man.  He, too, was in black from top to toe; but he\ncarried an umbrella.\n\nHe drew nearer, and the direction of the rain caused him so to slant his\numbrella that from her height above the ground his head was invisible, as\nshe was also to him.  He passed in due time directly beneath her, and in\nlooking down upon the exterior of his umbrella her feminine eyes\nperceived it to be of superior silk--less common at that date than\nsince--and of elegant make.  He reached the entrance to the building, and\nFancy suddenly lost sight of him.  Instead of pursuing the roadway as\nDick had done he had turned sharply round into her own porch.\n\nShe jumped to the floor, hastily flung off her shawl and bonnet, smoothed\nand patted her hair till the curls hung in passable condition, and\nlistened.  No knock.  Nearly a minute passed, and still there was no\nknock.  Then there arose a soft series of raps, no louder than the\ntapping of a distant woodpecker, and barely distinct enough to reach her\nears.  She composed herself and flung open the door.\n\nIn the porch stood Mr. Maybold.\n\nThere was a warm flush upon his face, and a bright flash in his eyes,\nwhich made him look handsomer than she had ever seen him before.\n\n\"Good-evening, Miss Day.\"\n\n\"Good-evening, Mr. Maybold,\" she said, in a strange state of mind.  She\nhad noticed, beyond the ardent hue of his face, that his voice had a\nsingular tremor in it, and that his hand shook like an aspen leaf when he\nlaid his umbrella in the corner of the porch.  Without another word being\nspoken by either, he came into the schoolroom, shut the door, and moved\nclose to her.  Once inside, the expression of his face was no more\ndiscernible, by reason of the increasing dusk of evening.\n\n\"I want to speak to you,\" he then said; \"seriously--on a perhaps\nunexpected subject, but one which is all the world to me--I don't know\nwhat it may be to you, Miss Day.\"\n\nNo reply.\n\n\"Fancy, I have come to ask you if you will be my wife?\"\n\nAs a person who has been idly amusing himself with rolling a snowball\nmight start at finding he had set in motion an avalanche, so did Fancy\nstart at these words from the vicar.  And in the dead silence which\nfollowed them, the breathings of the man and of the woman could be\ndistinctly and separately heard; and there was this difference between\nthem--his respirations gradually grew quieter and less rapid after the\nenunciation, hers, from having been low and regular, increased in\nquickness and force, till she almost panted.\n\n\"I cannot, I cannot, Mr. Maybold--I cannot!  Don't ask me!\" she said.\n\n\"Don't answer in a hurry!\" he entreated.  \"And do listen to me.  This is\nno sudden feeling on my part.  I have loved you for more than six months!\nPerhaps my late interest in teaching the children here has not been so\nsingle-minded as it seemed.  You will understand my motive--like me\nbetter, perhaps, for honestly telling you that I have struggled against\nmy emotion continually, because I have thought that it was not well for\nme to love you!  But I resolved to struggle no longer; I have examined\nthe feeling; and the love I bear you is as genuine as that I could bear\nany woman!  I see your great charm; I respect your natural talents, and\nthe refinement they have brought into your nature--they are quite enough,\nand more than enough for me!  They are equal to anything ever required of\nthe mistress of a quiet parsonage-house--the place in which I shall pass\nmy days, wherever it may be situated.  O Fancy, I have watched you,\ncriticized you even severely, brought my feelings to the light of\njudgment, and still have found them rational, and such as any man might\nhave expected to be inspired with by a woman like you!  So there is\nnothing hurried, secret, or untoward in my desire to do this.  Fancy,\nwill you marry me?\"\n\nNo answer was returned.\n\n\"Don't refuse; don't,\" he implored.  \"It would be foolish of you--I mean\ncruel!  Of course we would not live here, Fancy.  I have had for a long\ntime the offer of an exchange of livings with a friend in Yorkshire, but\nI have hitherto refused on account of my mother.  There we would go.  Your\nmusical powers shall be still further developed; you shall have whatever\npianoforte you like; you shall have anything, Fancy, anything to make you\nhappy--pony-carriage, flowers, birds, pleasant society; yes, you have\nenough in you for any society, after a few months of travel with me!  Will\nyou, Fancy, marry me?\"\n\nAnother pause ensued, varied only by the surging of the rain against the\nwindow-panes, and then Fancy spoke, in a faint and broken voice.\n\n\"Yes, I will,\" she said.\n\n\"God bless you, my own!\"  He advanced quickly, and put his arm out to\nembrace her.  She drew back hastily.  \"No no, not now!\" she said in an\nagitated whisper.  \"There are things;--but the temptation is, O, too\nstrong, and I can't resist it; I can't tell you now, but I must tell you!\nDon't, please, don't come near me now!  I want to think, I can scarcely\nget myself used to the idea of what I have promised yet.\"  The next\nminute she turned to a desk, buried her face in her hands, and burst into\na hysterical fit of weeping.  \"O, leave me to myself!\" she sobbed; \"leave\nme!  O, leave me!\"\n\n\"Don't be distressed; don't, dearest!\"  It was with visible difficulty\nthat he restrained himself from approaching her.  \"You shall tell me at\nyour leisure what it is that grieves you so; I am happy--beyond all\nmeasure happy!--at having your simple promise.\"\n\n\"And do go and leave me now!\"\n\n\"But I must not, in justice to you, leave for a minute, until you are\nyourself again.\"\n\n\"There then,\" she said, controlling her emotion, and standing up; \"I am\nnot disturbed now.\"\n\nHe reluctantly moved towards the door.  \"Good-bye!\" he murmured tenderly.\n\"I'll come to-morrow about this time.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII: SECOND THOUGHTS\n\n\nThe next morning the vicar rose early.  The first thing he did was to\nwrite a long and careful letter to his friend in Yorkshire.  Then, eating\na little breakfast, he crossed the meadows in the direction of\nCasterbridge, bearing his letter in his pocket, that he might post it at\nthe town office, and obviate the loss of one day in its transmission that\nwould have resulted had he left it for the foot-post through the village.\n\nIt was a foggy morning, and the trees shed in noisy water-drops the\nmoisture they had collected from the thick air, an acorn occasionally\nfalling from its cup to the ground, in company with the drippings.  In\nthe meads, sheets of spiders'-web, almost opaque with wet, hung in folds\nover the fences, and the falling leaves appeared in every variety of\nbrown, green, and yellow hue.\n\nA low and merry whistling was heard on the highway he was approaching,\nthen the light footsteps of a man going in the same direction as himself.\nOn reaching the junction of his path with the road, the vicar beheld Dick\nDewy's open and cheerful face.  Dick lifted his hat, and the vicar came\nout into the highway that Dick was pursuing.\n\n\"Good-morning, Dewy.  How well you are looking!\" said Mr. Maybold.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I am well--quite well!  I am going to Casterbridge now, to get\nSmart's collar; we left it there Saturday to be repaired.\"\n\n\"I am going to Casterbridge, so we'll walk together,\" the vicar said.\nDick gave a hop with one foot to put himself in step with Mr. Maybold,\nwho proceeded: \"I fancy I didn't see you at church yesterday, Dewy.  Or\nwere you behind the pier?\"\n\n\"No; I went to Charmley.  Poor John Dunford chose me to be one of his\nbearers a long time before he died, and yesterday was the funeral.  Of\ncourse I couldn't refuse, though I should have liked particularly to have\nbeen at home as 'twas the day of the new music.\"\n\n\"Yes, you should have been.  The musical portion of the service was\nsuccessful--very successful indeed; and what is more to the purpose, no\nill-feeling whatever was evinced by any of the members of the old choir.\nThey joined in the singing with the greatest good-will.\"\n\n\"'Twas natural enough that I should want to be there, I suppose,\" said\nDick, smiling a private smile; \"considering who the organ-player was.\"\n\nAt this the vicar reddened a little, and said, \"Yes, yes,\" though not at\nall comprehending Dick's true meaning, who, as he received no further\nreply, continued hesitatingly, and with another smile denoting his pride\nas a lover--\n\n\"I suppose you know what I mean, sir?  You've heard about me and--Miss\nDay?\"\n\nThe red in Maybold's countenance went away: he turned and looked Dick in\nthe face.\n\n\"No,\" he said constrainedly, \"I've heard nothing whatever about you and\nMiss Day.\"\n\n\"Why, she's my sweetheart, and we are going to be married next Midsummer.\nWe are keeping it rather close just at present, because 'tis a good many\nmonths to wait; but it is her father's wish that we don't marry before,\nand of course we must submit.  But the time 'ill soon slip along.\"\n\n\"Yes, the time will soon slip along--Time glides away every day--yes.\"\n\nMaybold said these words, but he had no idea of what they were.  He was\nconscious of a cold and sickly thrill throughout him; and all he reasoned\nwas this that the young creature whose graces had intoxicated him into\nmaking the most imprudent resolution of his life, was less an angel than\na woman.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" continued the ingenuous Dick, \"'twill be better in one\nsense.  I shall by that time be the regular manager of a branch o'\nfather's business, which has very much increased lately, and business,\nwhich we think of starting elsewhere.  It has very much increased lately,\nand we expect next year to keep a' extra couple of horses.  We've already\nour eye on one--brown as a berry, neck like a rainbow, fifteen hands, and\nnot a gray hair in her--offered us at twenty-five want a crown.  And to\nkip pace with the times I have had some cards prented and I beg leave to\nhand you one, sir.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the vicar, mechanically taking the card that Dick\noffered him.\n\n\"I turn in here by Grey's Bridge,\" said Dick.  \"I suppose you go straight\non and up town?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good-morning, sir.\"\n\n\"Good-morning, Dewy.\"\n\nMaybold stood still upon the bridge, holding the card as it had been put\ninto his hand, and Dick's footsteps died away towards Durnover Mill.  The\nvicar's first voluntary action was to read the card:--\n\n   DEWY AND SON,\n   TRANTERS AND HAULIERS,\n   MELLSTOCK.\n   NB.--Furniture, Coals, Potatoes, Live and Dead Stock, removed to any\n   distance on the shortest notice.\n\nMr. Maybold leant over the parapet of the bridge and looked into the\nriver.  He saw--without heeding--how the water came rapidly from beneath\nthe arches, glided down a little steep, then spread itself over a pool in\nwhich dace, trout, and minnows sported at ease among the long green locks\nof weed that lay heaving and sinking with their roots towards the\ncurrent.  At the end of ten minutes spent leaning thus, he drew from his\npocket the letter to his friend, tore it deliberately into such minute\nfragments that scarcely two syllables remained in juxtaposition, and sent\nthe whole handful of shreds fluttering into the water.  Here he watched\nthem eddy, dart, and turn, as they were carried downwards towards the\nocean and gradually disappeared from his view.  Finally he moved off, and\npursued his way at a rapid pace back again to Mellstock Vicarage.\n\nNerving himself by a long and intense effort, he sat down in his study\nand wrote as follows:\n\n   \"DEAR MISS DAY,--The meaning of your words, 'the temptation is too\n   strong,' of your sadness and your tears, has been brought home to me\n   by an accident.  I know to-day what I did not know yesterday--that you\n   are not a free woman.\n\n   \"Why did you not tell me--why didn't you?  Did you suppose I knew?  No.\n   Had I known, my conduct in coming to you as I did would have been\n   reprehensible.\n\n   \"But I don't chide you!  Perhaps no blame attaches to you--I can't\n   tell.  Fancy, though my opinion of you is assailed and disturbed in a\n   way which cannot be expressed, I love you still, and my word to you\n   holds good yet.  But will you, in justice to an honest man who relies\n   upon your word to him, consider whether, under the circumstances, you\n   can honourably forsake him?--Yours ever sincerely,\n\n   \"ARTHUR MAYBOLD.\"\n\nHe rang the bell.  \"Tell Charles to take these copybooks and this note to\nthe school at once.\"\n\nThe maid took the parcel and the letter, and in a few minutes a boy was\nseen to leave the vicarage gate, with the one under his arm, and the\nother in his hand.  The vicar sat with his hand to his brow, watching the\nlad as he descended Church Lane and entered the waterside path which\nintervened between that spot and the school.\n\nHere he was met by another boy, and after a free salutation and\npugilistic frisk had passed between the two, the second boy came on his\nway to the vicarage, and the other vanished out of sight.\n\nThe boy came to the door, and a note for Mr. Maybold was brought in.\n\nHe knew the writing.  Opening the envelope with an unsteady hand, he read\nthe subjoined words:\n\n   \"DEAR MR. MAYBOLD,--I have been thinking seriously and sadly through\n   the whole of the night of the question you put to me last evening and\n   of my answer.  That answer, as an honest woman, I had no right to\n   give.\n\n   \"It is my nature--perhaps all women's--to love refinement of mind and\n   manners; but even more than this, to be ever fascinated with the idea\n   of surroundings more elegant and pleasing than those which have been\n   customary.  And you praised me, and praise is life to me.  It was\n   alone my sensations at these things which prompted my reply.  Ambition\n   and vanity they would be called; perhaps they are so.\n\n   \"After this explanation I hope you will generously allow me to\n   withdraw the answer I too hastily gave.\n\n   \"And one more request.  To keep the meeting of last night, and all\n   that passed between us there, for ever a secret.  Were it to become\n   known, it would utterly blight the happiness of a trusting and\n   generous man, whom I love still, and shall love always.--Yours\n   sincerely,\n\n   \"FANCY DAY.\n\nThe last written communication that ever passed from the vicar to Fancy,\nwas a note containing these words only:\n\n   \"Tell him everything; it is best.  He will forgive you.\"\n\n\n\n\nPART THE FIFTH: CONCLUSION\n\n\nCHAPTER I: 'THE KNOT THERE'S NO UNTYING'\n\n\nThe last day of the story is dated just subsequent to that point in the\ndevelopment of the seasons when country people go to bed among nearly\nnaked trees, are lulled to sleep by a fall of rain, and awake next\nmorning among green ones; when the landscape appears embarrassed with the\nsudden weight and brilliancy of its leaves; when the night-jar comes and\nstrikes up for the summer his tune of one note; when the apple-trees have\nbloomed, and the roads and orchard-grass become spotted with fallen\npetals; when the faces of the delicate flowers are darkened, and their\nheads weighed down, by the throng of honey-bees, which increase their\nhumming till humming is too mild a term for the all-pervading sound; and\nwhen cuckoos, blackbirds, and sparrows, that have hitherto been merry and\nrespectful neighbours, become noisy and persistent intimates.\n\nThe exterior of Geoffrey Day's house in Yalbury Wood appeared exactly as\nwas usual at that season, but a frantic barking of the dogs at the back\ntold of unwonted movements somewhere within.  Inside the door the eyes\nbeheld a gathering, which was a rarity indeed for the dwelling of the\nsolitary wood-steward and keeper.\n\nAbout the room were sitting and standing, in various gnarled attitudes,\nour old acquaintance, grandfathers James and William, the tranter, Mr.\nPenny, two or three children, including Jimmy and Charley, besides three\nor four country ladies and gentlemen from a greater distance who do not\nrequire any distinction by name.  Geoffrey was seen and heard stamping\nabout the outhouse and among the bushes of the garden, attending to\ndetails of daily routine before the proper time arrived for their\nperformance, in order that they might be off his hands for the day.  He\nappeared with his shirt-sleeves rolled up; his best new nether garments,\nin which he had arrayed himself that morning, being temporarily disguised\nunder a weekday apron whilst these proceedings were in operation.  He\noccasionally glanced at the hives in passing, to see if his wife's bees\nwere swarming, ultimately rolling down his shirt-sleeves and going\nindoors, talking to tranter Dewy whilst buttoning the wristbands, to save\ntime; next going upstairs for his best waistcoat, and coming down again\nto make another remark whilst buttoning that, during the time looking\nfixedly in the tranter's face as if he were a looking-glass.\n\nThe furniture had undergone attenuation to an alarming extent, every\nduplicate piece having been removed, including the clock by Thomas Wood;\nEzekiel Saunders being at last left sole referee in matters of time.\n\nFancy was stationary upstairs, receiving her layers of clothes and\nadornments, and answering by short fragments of laughter which had more\nfidgetiness than mirth in them, remarks that were made from time to time\nby Mrs. Dewy and Mrs. Penny, who were assisting her at the toilet, Mrs.\nDay having pleaded a queerness in her head as a reason for shutting\nherself up in an inner bedroom for the whole morning.  Mrs. Penny\nappeared with nine corkscrew curls on each side of her temples, and a\nback comb stuck upon her crown like a castle on a steep.\n\nThe conversation just now going on was concerning the banns, the last\npublication of which had been on the Sunday previous.\n\n\"And how did they sound?\" Fancy subtly inquired.\n\n\"Very beautiful indeed,\" said Mrs. Penny.  \"I never heard any sound\nbetter.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"O, so natural and elegant, didn't they, Reuben!\" she cried, through the\nchinks of the unceiled floor, to the tranter downstairs.\n\n\"What's that?\" said the tranter, looking up inquiringly at the floor\nabove him for an answer.\n\n\"Didn't Dick and Fancy sound well when they were called home in church\nlast Sunday?\" came downwards again in Mrs. Penny's voice.\n\n\"Ay, that they did, my sonnies!--especially the first time.  There was a\nterrible whispering piece of work in the congregation, wasn't there,\nneighbour Penny?\" said the tranter, taking up the thread of conversation\non his own account and, in order to be heard in the room above, speaking\nvery loud to Mr. Penny, who sat at the distance of three feet from him,\nor rather less.\n\n\"I never can mind seeing such a whispering as there was,\" said Mr. Penny,\nalso loudly, to the room above.  \"And such sorrowful envy on the maidens'\nfaces; really, I never did see such envy as there was!\"\n\nFancy's lineaments varied in innumerable little flushes, and her heart\npalpitated innumerable little tremors of pleasure.  \"But perhaps,\" she\nsaid, with assumed indifference, \"it was only because no religion was\ngoing on just then?\"\n\n\"O, no; nothing to do with that.  'Twas because of your high standing in\nthe parish.  It was just as if they had one and all caught Dick kissing\nand coling ye to death, wasn't it, Mrs. Dewy?\"\n\n\"Ay; that 'twas.\"\n\n\"How people will talk about one's doings!\" Fancy exclaimed.\n\n\"Well, if you make songs about yourself, my dear, you can't blame other\npeople for singing 'em.\"\n\n\"Mercy me! how shall I go through it?\" said the young lady again, but\nmerely to those in the bedroom, with a breathing of a kind between a sigh\nand a pant, round shining eyes, and warm face.\n\n\"O, you'll get through it well enough, child,\" said Mrs. Dewy placidly.\n\"The edge of the performance is took off at the calling home; and when\nonce you get up to the chancel end o' the church, you feel as saucy as\nyou please.  I'm sure I felt as brave as a sodger all through the\ndeed--though of course I dropped my face and looked modest, as was\nbecoming to a maid.  Mind you do that, Fancy.\"\n\n\"And I walked into the church as quiet as a lamb, I'm sure,\" subjoined\nMrs. Penny.  \"There, you see Penny is such a little small man.  But\ncertainly, I was flurried in the inside o' me.  Well, thinks I, 'tis to\nbe, and here goes!  And do you do the same: say, ''Tis to be, and here\ngoes!'\"\n\n\"Is there such wonderful virtue in ''Tis to be, and here goes!'\" inquired\nFancy.\n\n\"Wonderful!  'Twill carry a body through it all from wedding to\nchurching, if you only let it out with spirit enough.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Fancy, blushing.  \"'Tis to be, and here goes!\"\n\n\"That's a girl for a husband!\" said Mrs. Dewy.\n\n\"I do hope he'll come in time!\" continued the bride-elect, inventing a\nnew cause of affright, now that the other was demolished.\n\n\"'Twould be a thousand pities if he didn't come, now you be so brave,\"\nsaid Mrs. Penny.\n\nGrandfather James, having overheard some of these remarks, said\ndownstairs with mischievous loudness--\n\n\"I've known some would-be weddings when the men didn't come.\"\n\n\"They've happened not to come, before now, certainly,\" said Mr. Penny,\ncleaning one of the glasses of his spectacles.\n\n\"O, do hear what they are saying downstairs,\" whispered Fancy.  \"Hush,\nhush!\"\n\nShe listened.\n\n\"They have, haven't they, Geoffrey?\" continued grandfather James, as\nGeoffrey entered.\n\n\"Have what?\" said Geoffrey.\n\n\"The men have been known not to come.\"\n\n\"That they have,\" said the keeper.\n\n\"Ay; I've knowed times when the wedding had to be put off through his not\nappearing, being tired of the woman.  And another case I knowed was when\nthe man was catched in a man-trap crossing Oaker's Wood, and the three\nmonths had run out before he got well, and the banns had to be published\nover again.\"\n\n\"How horrible!\" said Fancy.\n\n\"They only say it on purpose to tease 'ee, my dear,\" said Mrs. Dewy.\n\n\"'Tis quite sad to think what wretched shifts poor maids have been put\nto,\" came again from downstairs.  \"Ye should hear Clerk Wilkins, my\nbrother-law, tell his experiences in marrying couples these last thirty\nyear: sometimes one thing, sometimes another--'tis quite\nheart-rending--enough to make your hair stand on end.\"\n\n\"Those things don't happen very often, I know,\" said Fancy, with\nsmouldering uneasiness.\n\n\"Well, really 'tis time Dick was here,\" said the tranter.\n\n\"Don't keep on at me so, grandfather James and Mr. Dewy, and all you down\nthere!\" Fancy broke out, unable to endure any longer.  \"I am sure I shall\ndie, or do something, if you do!\"\n\n\"Never you hearken to these old chaps, Miss Day!\" cried Nat Callcome, the\nbest man, who had just entered, and threw his voice upward through the\nchinks of the floor as the others had done.  \"'Tis all right; Dick's\ncoming on like a wild feller; he'll be here in a minute.  The hive o'\nbees his mother gie'd en for his new garden swarmed jist as he was\nstarting, and he said, 'I can't afford to lose a stock o' bees; no, that\nI can't, though I fain would; and Fancy wouldn't wish it on any account.'\nSo he jist stopped to ting to 'em and shake 'em.\"\n\n\"A genuine wise man,\" said Geoffrey.\n\n\"To be sure, what a day's work we had yesterday!\" Mr. Callcome continued,\nlowering his voice as if it were not necessary any longer to include\nthose in the room above among his audience, and selecting a remote corner\nof his best clean handkerchief for wiping his face.  \"To be sure!\"\n\n\"Things so heavy, I suppose,\" said Geoffrey, as if reading through the\nchimney-window from the far end of the vista.\n\n\"Ay,\" said Nat, looking round the room at points from which furniture had\nbeen removed.  \"And so awkward to carry, too.  'Twas ath'art and across\nDick's garden; in and out Dick's door; up and down Dick's stairs; round\nand round Dick's chammers till legs were worn to stumps: and Dick is so\nparticular, too.  And the stores of victuals and drink that lad has laid\nin: why, 'tis enough for Noah's ark!  I'm sure I never wish to see a\nchoicer half-dozen of hams than he's got there in his chimley; and the\ncider I tasted was a very pretty drop, indeed;--none could desire a\nprettier cider.\"\n\n\"They be for the love and the stalled ox both.  Ah, the greedy martels!\"\nsaid grandfather James.\n\n\"Well, may-be they be.  Surely,\" says I, \"that couple between 'em have\nheaped up so much furniture and victuals, that anybody would think they\nwere going to take hold the big end of married life first, and begin wi'\na grown-up family.  Ah, what a bath of heat we two chaps were in, to be\nsure, a-getting that furniture in order!\"\n\n\"I do so wish the room below was ceiled,\" said Fancy, as the dressing\nwent on; \"we can hear all they say and do down there.\"\n\n\"Hark!  Who's that?\" exclaimed a small pupil-teacher, who also assisted\nthis morning, to her great delight.  She ran half-way down the stairs,\nand peeped round the banister.  \"O, you should, you should, you should!\"\nshe exclaimed, scrambling up to the room again.\n\n\"What?\" said Fancy.\n\n\"See the bridesmaids!  They've just a come!  'Tis wonderful, really! 'tis\nwonderful how muslin can be brought to it.  There, they don't look a bit\nlike themselves, but like some very rich sisters o' theirs that nobody\nknew they had!\"\n\n\"Make 'em come up to me, make 'em come up!\" cried Fancy ecstatically; and\nthe four damsels appointed, namely, Miss Susan Dewy, Miss Bessie Dewy,\nMiss Vashti Sniff, and Miss Mercy Onmey, surged upstairs, and floated\nalong the passage.\n\n\"I wish Dick would come!\" was again the burden of Fancy.\n\nThe same instant a small twig and flower from the creeper outside the\ndoor flew in at the open window, and a masculine voice said, \"Ready,\nFancy dearest?\"\n\n\"There he is, he is!\" cried Fancy, tittering spasmodically, and breathing\nas it were for the first time that morning.\n\nThe bridesmaids crowded to the window and turned their heads in the\ndirection pointed out, at which motion eight earrings all swung as\none:--not looking at Dick because they particularly wanted to see him,\nbut with an important sense of their duty as obedient ministers of the\nwill of that apotheosised being--the Bride.\n\n\"He looks very taking!\" said Miss Vashti Sniff, a young lady who blushed\ncream-colour and wore yellow bonnet ribbons.\n\nDick was advancing to the door in a painfully new coat of shining cloth,\nprimrose-coloured waistcoat, hat of the same painful style of newness,\nand with an extra quantity of whiskers shaved off his face, and hair cut\nto an unwonted shortness in honour of the occasion.\n\n\"Now, I'll run down,\" said Fancy, looking at herself over her shoulder in\nthe glass, and flitting off.\n\n\"O Dick!\" she exclaimed, \"I am so glad you are come!  I knew you would,\nof course, but I thought, Oh if you shouldn't!\"\n\n\"Not come, Fancy!  Het or wet, blow or snow, here come I to-day!  Why,\nwhat's possessing your little soul?  You never used to mind such things a\nbit.\"\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Dick, I hadn't hoisted my colours and committed myself then!\"\nsaid Fancy.\n\n\"'Tis a pity I can't marry the whole five of ye!\" said Dick, surveying\nthem all round.\n\n\"Heh-heh-heh!\" laughed the four bridesmaids, and Fancy privately touched\nDick and smoothed him down behind his shoulder, as if to assure herself\nthat he was there in flesh and blood as her own property.\n\n\"Well, whoever would have thought such a thing?\" said Dick, taking off\nhis hat, sinking into a chair, and turning to the elder members of the\ncompany.\n\nThe latter arranged their eyes and lips to signify that in their opinion\nnobody could have thought such a thing, whatever it was.\n\n\"That my bees should ha' swarmed just then, of all times and seasons!\"\ncontinued Dick, throwing a comprehensive glance like a net over the whole\nauditory.  \"And 'tis a fine swarm, too: I haven't seen such a fine swarm\nfor these ten years.\"\n\n\"A' excellent sign,\" said Mrs. Penny, from the depths of experience.  \"A'\nexcellent sign.\"\n\n\"I am glad everything seems so right,\" said Fancy with a breath of\nrelief.\n\n\"And so am I,\" said the four bridesmaids with much sympathy.\n\n\"Well, bees can't be put off,\" observed the inharmonious grandfather\nJames.  \"Marrying a woman is a thing you can do at any moment; but a\nswarm o' bees won't come for the asking.\"\n\nDick fanned himself with his hat.  \"I can't think,\" he said thoughtfully,\n\"whatever 'twas I did to offend Mr. Maybold, a man I like so much too.  He\nrather took to me when he came first, and used to say he should like to\nsee me married, and that he'd marry me, whether the young woman I chose\nlived in his parish or no.  I just hinted to him of it when I put in the\nbanns, but he didn't seem to take kindly to the notion now, and so I said\nno more.  I wonder how it was.\"\n\n\"I wonder!\" said Fancy, looking into vacancy with those beautiful eyes of\nhers--too refined and beautiful for a tranter's wife; but, perhaps, not\ntoo good.\n\n\"Altered his mind, as folks will, I suppose,\" said the tranter.  \"Well,\nmy sonnies, there'll be a good strong party looking at us to-day as we go\nalong.\"\n\n\"And the body of the church,\" said Geoffrey, \"will be lined with females,\nand a row of young fellers' heads, as far down as the eyes, will be\nnoticed just above the sills of the chancel-winders.\"\n\n\"Ay, you've been through it twice,\" said Reuben, \"and well mid know.\"\n\n\"I can put up with it for once,\" said Dick, \"or twice either, or a dozen\ntimes.\"\n\n\"O Dick!\" said Fancy reproachfully.\n\n\"Why, dear, that's nothing,--only just a bit of a flourish.  You be as\nnervous as a cat to-day.\"\n\n\"And then, of course, when 'tis all over,\" continued the tranter, \"we\nshall march two and two round the parish.\"\n\n\"Yes, sure,\" said Mr. Penny: \"two and two: every man hitched up to his\nwoman, 'a b'lieve.\"\n\n\"I never can make a show of myself in that way!\" said Fancy, looking at\nDick to ascertain if he could.\n\n\"I'm agreed to anything you and the company like, my dear!\" said Mr.\nRichard Dewy heartily.\n\n\"Why, we did when we were married, didn't we, Ann?\" said the tranter;\n\"and so do everybody, my sonnies.\"\n\n\"And so did we,\" said Fancy's father.\n\n\"And so did Penny and I,\" said Mrs. Penny: \"I wore my best Bath clogs, I\nremember, and Penny was cross because it made me look so tall.\"\n\n\"And so did father and mother,\" said Miss Mercy Onmey.\n\n\"And I mean to, come next Christmas!\" said Nat the groomsman vigorously,\nand looking towards the person of Miss Vashti Sniff.\n\n\"Respectable people don't nowadays,\" said Fancy.  \"Still, since poor\nmother did, I will.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" resumed the tranter, \"'twas on a White Tuesday when I committed it.\nMellstock Club walked the same day, and we new-married folk went a-gaying\nround the parish behind 'em.  Everybody used to wear something white at\nWhitsuntide in them days.  My sonnies, I've got the very white trousers\nthat I wore, at home in box now.  Ha'n't I, Ann?\"\n\n\"You had till I cut 'em up for Jimmy,\" said Mrs. Dewy.\n\n\"And we ought, by rights, after doing this parish, to go round Higher and\nLower Mellstock, and call at Viney's, and so work our way hither again\nacross He'th,\" said Mr. Penny, recovering scent of the matter in hand.\n\"Dairyman Viney is a very respectable man, and so is Farmer Kex, and we\nought to show ourselves to them.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the tranter, \"we ought to go round Mellstock to do the thing\nwell.  We shall form a very striking object walking along in rotation,\ngood-now, neighbours?\"\n\n\"That we shall: a proper pretty sight for the nation,\" said Mrs. Penny.\n\n\"Hullo!\" said the tranter, suddenly catching sight of a singular human\nfigure standing in the doorway, and wearing a long smock-frock of pillow-\ncase cut and of snowy whiteness.  \"Why, Leaf! whatever dost thou do\nhere?\"\n\n\"I've come to know if so be I can come to the wedding--hee-hee!\" said\nLeaf in a voice of timidity.\n\n\"Now, Leaf,\" said the tranter reproachfully, \"you know we don't want 'ee\nhere to-day: we've got no room for ye, Leaf.\"\n\n\"Thomas Leaf, Thomas Leaf, fie upon ye for prying!\" said old William.\n\n\"I know I've got no head, but I thought, if I washed and put on a clane\nshirt and smock-frock, I might just call,\" said Leaf, turning away\ndisappointed and trembling.\n\n\"Poor feller!\" said the tranter, turning to Geoffrey.  \"Suppose we must\nlet en come?  His looks are rather against en, and he is terrible silly;\nbut 'a have never been in jail, and 'a won't do no harm.\"\n\nLeaf looked with gratitude at the tranter for these praises, and then\nanxiously at Geoffrey, to see what effect they would have in helping his\ncause.\n\n\"Ay, let en come,\" said Geoffrey decisively.  \"Leaf, th'rt welcome, 'st\nknow;\" and Leaf accordingly remained.\n\nThey were now all ready for leaving the house, and began to form a\nprocession in the following order: Fancy and her father, Dick and Susan\nDewy, Nat Callcome and Vashti Sniff, Ted Waywood and Mercy Onmey, and\nJimmy and Bessie Dewy.  These formed the executive, and all appeared in\nstrict wedding attire.  Then came the tranter and Mrs. Dewy, and last of\nall Mr. and Mrs. Penny;--the tranter conspicuous by his enormous gloves,\nsize eleven and three-quarters, which appeared at a distance like boxing\ngloves bleached, and sat rather awkwardly upon his brown hands; this hall-\nmark of respectability having been set upon himself to-day (by Fancy's\nspecial request) for the first time in his life.\n\n\"The proper way is for the bridesmaids to walk together,\" suggested\nFancy.\n\n\"What?  'Twas always young man and young woman, arm in crook, in my\ntime!\" said Geoffrey, astounded.\n\n\"And in mine!\" said the tranter.\n\n\"And in ours!\" said Mr. and Mrs. Penny.\n\n\"Never heard o' such a thing as woman and woman!\" said old William; who,\nwith grandfather James and Mrs. Day, was to stay at home.\n\n\"Whichever way you and the company like, my dear!\" said Dick, who, being\non the point of securing his right to Fancy, seemed willing to renounce\nall other rights in the world with the greatest pleasure.  The decision\nwas left to Fancy.\n\n\"Well, I think I'd rather have it the way mother had it,\" she said, and\nthe couples moved along under the trees, every man to his maid.\n\n\"Ah!\" said grandfather James to grandfather William as they retired, \"I\nwonder which she thinks most about, Dick or her wedding raiment!\"\n\n\"Well, 'tis their nature,\" said grandfather William.  \"Remember the words\nof the prophet Jeremiah: 'Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her\nattire?'\"\n\nNow among dark perpendicular firs, like the shafted columns of a\ncathedral; now through a hazel copse, matted with primroses and wild\nhyacinths; now under broad beeches in bright young leaves they threaded\ntheir way into the high road over Yalbury Hill, which dipped at that\npoint directly into the village of Geoffrey Day's parish; and in the\nspace of a quarter of an hour Fancy found herself to be Mrs. Richard\nDewy, though, much to her surprise, feeling no other than Fancy Day\nstill.\n\nOn the circuitous return walk through the lanes and fields, amid much\nchattering and laughter, especially when they came to stiles, Dick\ndiscerned a brown spot far up a turnip field.\n\n\"Why, 'tis Enoch!\" he said to Fancy.  \"I thought I missed him at the\nhouse this morning.  How is it he's left you?\"\n\n\"He drank too much cider, and it got into his head, and they put him in\nWeatherbury stocks for it.  Father was obliged to get somebody else for a\nday or two, and Enoch hasn't had anything to do with the woods since.\"\n\n\"We might ask him to call down to-night.  Stocks are nothing for once,\nconsidering 'tis our wedding day.\"  The bridal party was ordered to halt.\n\n\"Eno-o-o-o-ch!\" cried Dick at the top of his voice.\n\n\"Y-a-a-a-a-a-as!\" said Enoch from the distance.\n\n\"D'ye know who I be-e-e-e-e-e?\"\n\n\"No-o-o-o-o-o-o!\"\n\n\"Dick Dew-w-w-w-wy!\"\n\n\"O-h-h-h-h-h!\"\n\n\"Just a-ma-a-a-a-a-arried!\"\n\n\"O-h-h-h-h-h!\"\n\n\"This is my wife, Fa-a-a-a-a-ancy!\" (holding her up to Enoch's view as if\nshe had been a nosegay.)\n\n\"O-h-h-h-h-h!\"\n\n\"Will ye come across to the party to-ni-i-i-i-i-i-ight!\"\n\n\"Ca-a-a-a-a-an't!\"\n\n\"Why n-o-o-o-o-ot?\"\n\n\"Don't work for the family no-o-o-o-ow!\"\n\n\"Not nice of Master Enoch,\" said Dick, as they resumed their walk.\n\n\"You mustn't blame en,\" said Geoffrey; \"the man's not hisself now; he's\nin his morning frame of mind.  When he's had a gallon o' cider or ale, or\na pint or two of mead, the man's well enough, and his manners be as good\nas anybody's in the kingdom.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II: UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE\n\n\nThe point in Yalbury Wood which abutted on the end of Geoffrey Day's\npremises was closed with an ancient tree, horizontally of enormous\nextent, though having no great pretensions to height.  Many hundreds of\nbirds had been born amidst the boughs of this single tree; tribes of\nrabbits and hares had nibbled at its bark from year to year; quaint tufts\nof fungi had sprung from the cavities of its forks; and countless\nfamilies of moles and earthworms had crept about its roots.  Beneath and\nbeyond its shade spread a carefully-tended grass-plot, its purpose being\nto supply a healthy exercise-ground for young chickens and pheasants; the\nhens, their mothers, being enclosed in coops placed upon the same green\nflooring.\n\nAll these encumbrances were now removed, and as the afternoon advanced,\nthe guests gathered on the spot, where music, dancing, and the singing of\nsongs went forward with great spirit throughout the evening.  The\npropriety of every one was intense by reason of the influence of Fancy,\nwho, as an additional precaution in this direction, had strictly charged\nher father and the tranter to carefully avoid saying 'thee' and 'thou' in\ntheir conversation, on the plea that those ancient words sounded so very\nhumiliating to persons of newer taste; also that they were never to be\nseen drawing the back of the hand across the mouth after drinking--a\nlocal English custom of extraordinary antiquity, but stated by Fancy to\nbe decidedly dying out among the better classes of society.\n\nIn addition to the local musicians present, a man who had a thorough\nknowledge of the tambourine was invited from the village of Tantrum\nClangley,--a place long celebrated for the skill of its inhabitants as\nperformers on instruments of percussion.  These important members of the\nassembly were relegated to a height of two or three feet from the ground,\nupon a temporary erection of planks supported by barrels.  Whilst the\ndancing progressed the older persons sat in a group under the trunk of\nthe tree,--the space being allotted to them somewhat grudgingly by the\nyoung ones, who were greedy of pirouetting room,--and fortified by a\ntable against the heels of the dancers.  Here the gaffers and gammers,\nwhose dancing days were over, told stories of great impressiveness, and\nat intervals surveyed the advancing and retiring couples from the same\nretreat, as people on shore might be supposed to survey a naval\nengagement in the bay beyond; returning again to their tales when the\npause was over.  Those of the whirling throng, who, during the rests\nbetween each figure, turned their eyes in the direction of these seated\nones, were only able to discover, on account of the music and bustle,\nthat a very striking circumstance was in course of narration--denoted by\nan emphatic sweep of the hand, snapping of the fingers, close of the\nlips, and fixed look into the centre of the listener's eye for the space\nof a quarter of a minute, which raised in that listener such a\nreciprocating working of face as to sometimes make the distant dancers\nhalf wish to know what such an interesting tale could refer to.\n\nFancy caused her looks to wear as much matronly expression as was\nobtainable out of six hours' experience as a wife, in order that the\ncontrast between her own state of life and that of the unmarried young\nwomen present might be duly impressed upon the company: occasionally\nstealing glances of admiration at her left hand, but this quite\nprivately; for her ostensible bearing concerning the matter was intended\nto show that, though she undoubtedly occupied the most wondrous position\nin the eyes of the world that had ever been attained, she was almost\nunconscious of the circumstance, and that the somewhat prominent position\nin which that wonderfully-emblazoned left hand was continually found to\nbe placed, when handing cups and saucers, knives, forks, and glasses, was\nquite the result of accident.  As to wishing to excite envy in the bosoms\nof her maiden companions, by the exhibition of the shining ring, every\none was to know it was quite foreign to the dignity of such an\nexperienced married woman.  Dick's imagination in the meantime was far\nless capable of drawing so much wontedness from his new condition.  He\nhad been for two or three hours trying to feel himself merely a newly-\nmarried man, but had been able to get no further in the attempt than to\nrealize that he was Dick Dewy, the tranter's son, at a party given by\nLord Wessex's head man-in-charge, on the outlying Yalbury estate, dancing\nand chatting with Fancy Day.\n\nFive country dances, including 'Haste to the Wedding,' two reels, and\nthree fragments of horn-pipes, brought them to the time for supper,\nwhich, on account of the dampness of the grass from the immaturity of the\nsummer season, was spread indoors.  At the conclusion of the meal Dick\nwent out to put the horse in; and Fancy, with the elder half of the four\nbridesmaids, retired upstairs to dress for the journey to Dick's new\ncottage near Mellstock.\n\n\"How long will you be putting on your bonnet, Fancy?\" Dick inquired at\nthe foot of the staircase.  Being now a man of business and married, he\nwas strong on the importance of time, and doubled the emphasis of his\nwords in conversing, and added vigour to his nods.\n\n\"Only a minute.\"\n\n\"How long is that?\"\n\n\"Well, dear, five.\"\n\n\"Ah, sonnies!\" said the tranter, as Dick retired, \"'tis a talent of the\nfemale race that low numbers should stand for high, more especially in\nmatters of waiting, matters of age, and matters of money.\"\n\n\"True, true, upon my body,\" said Geoffrey.\n\n\"Ye spak with feeling, Geoffrey, seemingly.\"\n\n\"Anybody that d'know my experience might guess that.\"\n\n\"What's she doing now, Geoffrey?\"\n\n\"Claning out all the upstairs drawers and cupboards, and dusting the\nsecond-best chainey--a thing that's only done once a year.  'If there's\nwork to be done I must do it,' says she, 'wedding or no.'\"\n\n\"'Tis my belief she's a very good woman at bottom.\"\n\n\"She's terrible deep, then.\"\n\nMrs. Penny turned round.  \"Well, 'tis humps and hollers with the best of\nus; but still and for all that, Dick and Fancy stand as fair a chance of\nhaving a bit of sunsheen as any married pair in the land.\"\n\n\"Ay, there's no gainsaying it.\"\n\nMrs. Dewy came up, talking to one person and looking at another.  \"Happy,\nyes,\" she said.  \"'Tis always so when a couple is so exactly in tune with\none another as Dick and she.\"\n\n\"When they be'n't too poor to have time to sing,\" said grandfather James.\n\n\"I tell ye, neighbours, when the pinch comes,\" said the tranter: \"when\nthe oldest daughter's boots be only a size less than her mother's, and\nthe rest o' the flock close behind her.  A sharp time for a man that, my\nsonnies; a very sharp time!  Chanticleer's comb is a-cut then, 'a\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"That's about the form o't,\" said Mr. Penny.  \"That'll put the stuns upon\na man, when you must measure mother and daughter's lasts to tell 'em\napart.\"\n\n\"You've no cause to complain, Reuben, of such a close-coming flock,\" said\nMrs. Dewy; \"for ours was a straggling lot enough, God knows!\"\n\n\"I d'know it, I d'know it,\" said the tranter.  \"You be a well-enough\nwoman, Ann.\"\n\nMrs. Dewy put her mouth in the form of a smile, and put it back again\nwithout smiling.\n\n\"And if they come together, they go together,\" said Mrs. Penny, whose\nfamily had been the reverse of the tranter's; \"and a little money will\nmake either fate tolerable.  And money can be made by our young couple, I\nknow.\"\n\n\"Yes, that it can!\" said the impulsive voice of Leaf, who had hitherto\nhumbly admired the proceedings from a corner.  \"It can be done--all\nthat's wanted is a few pounds to begin with.  That's all!  I know a story\nabout it!\"\n\n\"Let's hear thy story, Leaf,\" said the tranter.  \"I never knew you were\nclever enough to tell a story.  Silence, all of ye!  Mr. Leaf will tell a\nstory.\"\n\n\"Tell your story, Thomas Leaf,\" said grandfather William in the tone of a\nschoolmaster.\n\n\"Once,\" said the delighted Leaf, in an uncertain voice, \"there was a man\nwho lived in a house!  Well, this man went thinking and thinking night\nand day.  At last, he said to himself, as I might, 'If I had only ten\npound, I'd make a fortune.'  At last by hook or by crook, behold he got\nthe ten pounds!\"\n\n\"Only think of that!\" said Nat Callcome satirically.\n\n\"Silence!\" said the tranter.\n\n\"Well, now comes the interesting part of the story!  In a little time he\nmade that ten pounds twenty.  Then a little time after that he doubled\nit, and made it forty.  Well, he went on, and a good while after that he\nmade it eighty, and on to a hundred.  Well, by-and-by he made it two\nhundred!  Well, you'd never believe it, but--he went on and made it four\nhundred!  He went on, and what did he do?  Why, he made it eight hundred!\nYes, he did,\" continued Leaf, in the highest pitch of excitement,\nbringing down his fist upon his knee with such force that he quivered\nwith the pain; \"yes, and he went on and made it A THOUSAND!\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said the tranter.  \"Better than the history of England, my\nsonnies!\"\n\n\"Thank you for your story, Thomas Leaf,\" said grandfather William; and\nthen Leaf gradually sank into nothingness again.\n\nAmid a medley of laughter, old shoes, and elder-wine, Dick and his bride\ntook their departure, side by side in the excellent new spring-cart which\nthe young tranter now possessed.  The moon was just over the full,\nrendering any light from lamps or their own beauties quite unnecessary to\nthe pair.  They drove slowly along Yalbury Bottom, where the road passed\nbetween two copses.  Dick was talking to his companion.\n\n\"Fancy,\" he said, \"why we are so happy is because there is such full\nconfidence between us.  Ever since that time you confessed to that little\nflirtation with Shiner by the river (which was really no flirtation at\nall), I have thought how artless and good you must be to tell me o' such\na trifling thing, and to be so frightened about it as you were.  It has\nwon me to tell you my every deed and word since then.  We'll have no\nsecrets from each other, darling, will we ever?--no secret at all.\"\n\n\"None from to-day,\" said Fancy.  \"Hark! what's that?\"\n\nFrom a neighbouring thicket was suddenly heard to issue in a loud,\nmusical, and liquid voice--\n\n\"Tippiwit! swe-e-et! ki-ki-ki!  Come hither, come hither, come hither!\"\n\n\"O, 'tis the nightingale,\" murmured she, and thought of a secret she\nwould never tell.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n{1} This, a local expression, must be a corruption of something less\nquestionable.\n\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 2662.txt or 2662.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/6\/6\/2662\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/about\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":985,"split":"train"}
