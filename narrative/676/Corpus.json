{"ori_id":"9f95235a053cfb0c15f5681c02dc44fc0caf065d","title":"Free Air","context":"Free Air\n \"This cheerful little road novel, published in 1919, is about Claire Boltwood, who, in the early days of the 20th century, travels by automobile from New York City to the Pacific Northwest, where she falls in love with a nice, down-to-earth young man and gives up her snobbish Estate.\" (From the Book Stub)\nFrom a critical perspective, Free Air is consistent with Sinclair Lewis's lean towards egalitarian politics, which he displays in his other works (most notably in It Can't Happen Here). Examples of his politics in Free Air are found in Lewis's emphasis on the heroic role played by the book's protagonist, Milt Dagget, a working class everyman type. Conversely, Lewis presents nearly every upper-class character in Claire Boltwood's world (including her railroad-mogul father) as being snobby elitists. The story also champions the democratic nature of the automobile versus the more aristocratic railroad travel. Lewis's showing favoritism towards the freedom which automobiles would eventually accord the working and middle classes bolsters the egalitarian, democratic aesthetic. Free Air is one of the first novels about the road trip, a subject around which the Beats (most notably Jack Kerouac) would build a cult following in the mid-20th century.\nComposer Ferde Grofe used the novel as the basis for the music to his adventurous composition Free Air.\nIn the HBO series Boardwalk Empire, set initially in 1920, Jimmy and his girlfriend Pearl are reading Free Air. The 18-year-old Chicago prostitute Pearl hopes to head West like the heroine, along with Jimmy.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Free Air, by Sinclair Lewis\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

When\nit was open, drops jabbed into her eyes and chilled her cheeks. She was\nexcited and thoroughly miserable. She realized that these Minnesota\ncountry roads had no respect for her polite experience on Long Island\nparkways. She felt like a woman, not like a driver.\n\nBut the Gomez-Dep roadster had seventy horsepower, and sang songs. Since\nshe had left Minneapolis nothing had passed her. Back yonder a truck had\ntried to crowd her, and she had dropped into a ditch, climbed a bank,\nreturned to the road, and after that the truck was not. Now she was\nregarding a view more splendid than mountains above a garden by the\nsea--a stretch of good road. To her passenger, her father, Claire\nchanted:\n\n\"Heavenly! There's some gravel. We can make time. We'll hustle on to the\nnext town and get dry.\"\n\n\"Yes. But don't mind me. You're doing very well,\" her father sighed.\n\nInstantly, the dismay of it rushing at her, she saw the end of the patch\nof gravel. The road ahead was a wet black smear, criss-crossed with\nruts. The car shot into a morass of prairie gumbo--which is mud mixed\nwith tar, fly-paper, fish glue, and well-chewed, chocolate-covered\ncaramels. When cattle get into gumbo, the farmers send for the\nstump-dynamite and try blasting.\n\nIt was her first really bad stretch of road. She was frightened. Then\nshe was too appallingly busy to be frightened, or to be Miss Claire\nBoltwood, or to comfort her uneasy father. She had to drive. Her frail\ngraceful arms put into it a vicious vigor that was genius.\n\nWhen the wheels struck the slime, they slid, they wallowed. The car\nskidded. It was terrifyingly out of control. It began majestically to\nturn toward the ditch. She fought the steering wheel as though she were\nshadow-boxing, but the car kept contemptuously staggering till it was\nsideways, straight across the road. Somehow, it was back again, eating\ninto a rut, going ahead. She didn't know how she had done it, but she\nhad got it back. She longed to take time to retrace her own cleverness\nin steering. She didn't. She kept going.\n\nThe car backfired, slowed. She yanked the gear from third into first.\nShe sped up. The motor ran like a terrified pounding heart, while the\ncar crept on by inches through filthy mud that stretched ahead of her\nwithout relief.\n\nShe was battling to hold the car in the principal rut. She snatched the\nwindshield open, and concentrated on that left rut. She felt that she\nwas keeping the wheel from climbing those high sides of the rut, those\nsix-inch walls of mud, sparkling with tiny grits. Her mind snarled at\nher arms, \"Let the ruts do the steering. You're just fighting against\nthem.\" It worked. Once she let the wheels alone they comfortably\nfollowed the furrows, and for three seconds she had that delightful\nbelief of every motorist after every mishap, \"Now that this particular\ndisagreeableness is over, I'll never, never have any trouble again!\"\n\nBut suppose the engine overheated, ran out of water? Anxiety twanged at\nher nerves. And the deep distinctive ruts were changing to a complex\npattern, like the rails in a city switchyard. She picked out the track\nof the one motor car that had been through here recently. It was marked\nwith the swastika tread of the rear tires. That track was her friend;\nshe knew and loved the driver of a car she had never seen in her life.\n\nShe was very tired. She wondered if she might not stop for a moment.\nThen she came to an upslope. The car faltered; felt indecisive beneath\nher. She jabbed down the accelerator. Her hands pushed at the steering\nwheel as though she were pushing the car. The engine picked up, sulkily\nkept going. To the eye, there was merely a rise in the rolling ground,\nbut to her anxiety it was a mountain up which she--not the engine, but\nherself--pulled this bulky mass, till she had reached the top, and was\nsafe again--for a second. Still there was no visible end of the mud.\n\nIn alarm she thought, \"How long does it last? I can't keep this up.\nI--Oh!\"\n\nThe guiding tread of the previous car was suddenly lost in a mass of\nheaving, bubble-scattered mud, like a batter of black dough. She fairly\npicked up the car, and flung it into that welter, through it, and back\ninto the reappearing swastika-marked trail.\n\nHer father spoke: \"You're biting your lips. They'll bleed, if you don't\nlook out. Better stop and rest.\"\n\n\"Can't! No bottom to this mud. Once stop and lose momentum--stuck for\nkeeps!\"\n\nShe had ten more minutes of it before she reached a combination of\nbridge and culvert, with a plank platform above a big tile drain. With\nthis solid plank bottom, she could stop. Silence came roaring down as\nshe turned the switch. The bubbling water in the radiator steamed about\nthe cap. Claire was conscious of tautness of the cords of her neck in\nfront; of a pain at the base of her brain. Her father glanced at her\ncuriously. \"I must be a wreck. I'm sure my hair is frightful,\" she\nthought, but forgot it as she looked at him. His face was unusually\npale. In the tumult of activity he had been betrayed into letting the\nold despondent look blur his eyes and sag his mouth. \"Must get on,\" she\ndetermined.\n\nClaire was dainty of habit. She detested untwisted hair, ripped gloves,\nmuddy shoes. Hesitant as a cat by a puddle, she stepped down on the\nbridge. Even on these planks, the mud was three inches thick. It\nsquidged about her low, spatted shoes. \"Eeh!\" she squeaked.\n\nShe tiptoed to the tool-box and took out a folding canvas bucket. She\nedged down to the trickling stream below. She was miserably conscious of\na pastoral scene all gone to mildew--cows beneath willows by the creek,\nmilkweeds dripping, dried mullein weed stalks no longer dry. The bank of\nthe stream was so slippery that she shot down two feet, and nearly went\nsprawling. Her knee did touch the bank, and the skirt of her gray\nsports-suit showed a smear of yellow earth.\n\nIn less than two miles the racing motor had used up so much water that\nshe had to make four trips to the creek before she had filled the\nradiator. When she had climbed back on the running-board she glared down\nat spats and shoes turned into gray lumps. She was not tearful. She was\nangry.\n\n\"Idiot! Ought to have put on my rubbers. Well--too late now,\" she\nobserved, as she started the engine.\n\nShe again followed the swastika tread. To avoid a hole in the road\nahead, the unknown driver had swung over to the side of the road, and\ntaken to the intensely black earth of the edge of an unfenced cornfield.\nFlashing at Claire came the sight of a deep, water-filled hole,\nscattered straw and brush, d\u00c3\u00a9bris of a battlefield, which made her\ngaspingly realize that her swastikaed leader had been stuck and--\n\nAnd instantly her own car was stuck.\n\nShe had had to put the car at that hole. It dropped, far down, and it\nstayed down. The engine stalled. She started it, but the back wheels\nspun merrily round and round, without traction. She did not make one\ninch. When she again killed the blatting motor, she let it stay dead.\nShe peered at her father.\n\nHe was not a father, just now, but a passenger trying not to irritate\nthe driver. He smiled in a waxy way, and said, \"Hard luck! Well, you did\nthe best you could. The other hole, there in the road, would have been\njust as bad. You're a fine driver, dolly.\"\n\nHer smile was warm and real. \"No. I'm a fool. You told me to put on\nchains. I didn't. I deserve it.\"\n\n\"Well, anyway, most men would be cussing. You acquire merit by not\nbeating me. I believe that's done, in moments like this. If you'd like,\nI'll get out and crawl around in the mud, and play turtle for you.\"\n\n\"No. I'm quite all right. I did feel frightfully strong-minded as long\nas there was any use of it. It kept me going. But now I might just as\nwell be cheerful, because we're stuck, and we're probably going to stay\nstuck for the rest of this care-free summer day.\"\n\nThe weariness of the long strain caught her, all at once. She slipped\nforward, sat huddled, her knees crossed under the edge of the steering\nwheel, her hands falling beside her, one of them making a faint brushing\nsound as it slid down the upholstery. Her eyes closed; as her head\ndrooped farther, she fancied she could hear the vertebrae click in her\ntense neck.\n\nHer father was silent, a misty figure in a lap-robe. The rain streaked\nthe mica lights in the side-curtains. A distant train whistled\ndesolately across the sodden fields. The inside of the car smelled\nmusty. The quiet was like a blanket over the ears. Claire was in a hazy\ndrowse. She felt that she could never drive again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nCLAIRE ESCAPES FROM RESPECTABILITY\n\n\nClaire Boltwood lived on the Heights, Brooklyn. Persons from New York\nand other parts of the Middlewest have been known to believe that\nBrooklyn is somehow humorous. In newspaper jokes and vaudeville it is so\npresented that people who are willing to take their philosophy from\nthose sources believe that the leading citizens of Brooklyn are all\ndeacons, undertakers, and obstetricians. The fact is that North\nWashington Square, at its reddest and whitest and fanlightedest,\nGramercy Park at its most ivied, are not so aristocratic as the section\nof Brooklyn called the Heights. Here preached Henry Ward Beecher. Here,\nin mansions like mausoleums, on the ridge above docks where the good\nships came sailing in from Sourabaya and Singapore, ruled the lords of a\nthousand sails. And still is it a place of wealth too solid to emulate\nthe nimble self-advertising of Fifth Avenue. Here dwell the\nfifth-generation possessors of blocks of foundries and shipyards. Here,\nin a big brick house of much dignity, much ugliness, and much\nconservatory, lived Claire Boltwood, with her widower father.\n\nHenry B. Boltwood was vice-president of a firm dealing in railway\nsupplies. He was neither wealthy nor at all poor. Every summer, despite\nClaire's delicate hints, they took the same cottage on the Jersey Coast,\nand Mr. Boltwood came down for Sunday. Claire had gone to a good school\nout of Philadelphia, on the Main Line. She was used to gracious leisure,\nattractive uselessness, nut-center chocolates, and a certain wonder as\nto why she was alive.\n\nShe wanted to travel, but her father could not get away. He consistently\nspent his days in overworking, and his evenings in wishing he hadn't\noverworked. He was attractive, fresh, pink-cheeked, white-mustached, and\nnerve-twitching with years of detail.\n\nClaire's ambition had once been babies and a solid husband, but as\nvarious young males of the species appeared before her, sang their\nmating songs and preened their newly dry-cleaned plumage, she found that\nthe trouble with solid young men was that they were solid. Though she\nliked to dance, the \"dancing men\" bored her. And she did not understand\nthe district's quota of intellectuals very well; she was good at\nlistening to symphony concerts, but she never had much luck in\ndiscussing the cleverness of the wood winds in taking up the main motif.\nIt is history that she refused a master of arts with an old violin, a\ngood taste in ties, and an income of eight thousand.\n\nThe only man who disturbed her was Geoffrey Saxton, known throughout the\ninterwoven sets of Brooklyn Heights as \"Jeff.\" Jeff Saxton was\nthirty-nine to Claire's twenty-three. He was clean and busy; he had no\nsigns of vice or humor. Especially for Jeff must have been invented the\nsymbolic morning coat, the unwrinkable gray trousers, and the moral\nrimless spectacles. He was a graduate of a nice college, and he had a\nnice tenor and a nice family and nice hands and he was nicely successful\nin New York copper dealing. When he was asked questions by people who\nwere impertinent, clever, or poor, Jeff looked them over coldly before\nhe answered, and often they felt so uncomfortable that he didn't have to\nanswer.\n\nThe boys of Claire's own age, not long out of Yale and Princeton, doing\nwell in business and jumping for their evening clothes daily at\nsix-thirty, light o' loves and admirers of athletic heroes, these lads\nClaire found pleasant, but hard to tell apart. She didn't have to tell\nJeff Saxton apart. He did his own telling. Jeff called--not too often.\nHe sang--not too sentimentally. He took her father and herself to the\ntheater--not too lavishly. He told Claire--in a voice not too\nserious--that she was his helmed Athena, his rose of all the world. He\ninformed her of his substantial position--not too obviously. And he was\nso everlastingly, firmly, quietly, politely, immovably always there.\n\nShe watched the hulk of marriage drifting down on her frail speed-boat\nof aspiration, and steered in desperate circles.\n\nThen her father got the nervous prostration he had richly earned. The\ndoctor ordered rest. Claire took him in charge. He didn't want to\ntravel. Certainly he didn't want the shore or the Adirondacks. As there\nwas a branch of his company in Minneapolis, she lured him that far away.\n\nBeing rootedly of Brooklyn Heights, Claire didn't know much about the\nWest. She thought that Milwaukee was the capital of Minnesota. She was\nnot so uninformed as some of her friends, however. She had heard that in\nDakota wheat was to be viewed in vast tracts--maybe a hundred acres.\n\nMr. Boltwood could not be coaxed to play with the people to whom his\nMinneapolis representative introduced him. He was overworking again, and\nperfectly happy. He was hoping to find something wrong with the branch\nhouse. Claire tried to tempt him out to the lakes. She failed. His\nnerve-fuse burnt out the second time, with much fireworks.\n\nClaire had often managed her circle of girls, but it had never occurred\nto her to manage her executive father save by indirect and pretty\nteasing. Now, in conspiracy with the doctor, she bullied her father. He\nsaw gray death waiting as alternative, and he was meek. He agreed to\neverything. He consented to drive with her across two thousand miles of\nplains and mountains to Seattle, to drop in for a call on their\ncousins, the Eugene Gilsons.\n\nBack East they had a chauffeur and two cars--the limousine, and the\nGomez-Deperdussin roadster, Claire's beloved. It would, she believed, be\nmore of a change from everything that might whisper to Mr. Boltwood of\nthe control of men, not to take a chauffeur. Her father never drove, but\nshe could, she insisted. His easy agreeing was pathetic. He watched her\nwith spaniel eyes. They had the Gomez roadster shipped to them from New\nYork.\n\nOn a July morning, they started out of Minneapolis in a mist, and as it\nhas been hinted, they stopped sixty miles northward, in a rain, also in\nmuch gumbo. Apparently their nearest approach to the Pacific Ocean would\nbe this oceanically moist edge of a cornfield, between Schoenstrom and\nGopher Prairie, Minnesota.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClaire roused from her damp doze and sighed, \"Well, I must get busy and\nget the car out of this.\"\n\n\"Don't you think you'd better get somebody to help us?\"\n\n\"But get who?\"\n\n\"Whom!\"\n\n\"No! It's just 'who,' when you're in the mud. No. One of the good things\nabout an adventure like this is that I must do things for myself. I've\nalways had people to do things for me. Maids and nice teachers and you,\nold darling! I suppose it's made me soft. Soft--I would like a soft\ndavenport and a novel and a pound of almond-brittle, and get all sick,\nand not feel so beastly virile as I do just now. But----\"\n\nShe turned up the collar of her gray tweed coat, painfully climbed\nout--the muscles of her back racking--and examined the state of the rear\nwheels. They were buried to the axle; in front of them the mud bulked in\nsolid, shiny blackness. She took out her jack and chains. It was too\nlate. There was no room to get the jack under the axle. She remembered\nfrom the narratives of motoring friends that brush in mud gave a firmer\nsurface for the wheels to climb upon.\n\nShe also remembered how jolly and agreeably heroic the accounts of their\nmishaps had sounded--a week after they were over.\n\nShe waded down the road toward an old wood-lot. At first she tried to\nkeep dry, but she gave it up, and there was pleasure in being defiantly\ndirty. She tramped straight through puddles; she wallowed in mud. In the\nwood-lot was long grass which soaked her stockings till her ankles felt\nitchy. Claire had never expected to be so very intimate with a\nbrush-pile. She became so. As though she were a pioneer woman who had\nbeen toiling here for years, she came to know the brush stick by\nstick--the long valuable branch that she could never quite get out from\nunder the others; the thorny bough that pricked her hands every time she\ntried to reach the curious bundle of switches.\n\nSeven trips she made, carrying armfuls of twigs and solemnly dragging\nlarge boughs behind her. She patted them down in front of all four\nwheels. Her crisp hands looked like the paws of a three-year-old boy\nmaking a mud fort. Her nails hurt from the mud wedged beneath them. Her\nmud-caked shoes were heavy to lift. It was with exquisite self-approval\nthat she sat on the running-board, scraped a car-load of lignite off her\nsoles, climbed back into the car, punched the starter.\n\nThe car stirred, crept forward one inch, and settled back--one inch. The\nsecond time it heaved encouragingly but did not make quite so much\nheadway. Then Claire did sob.\n\nShe rubbed her cheek against the comfortable, rough, heather-smelling\nshoulder of her father's coat, while he patted her and smiled, \"Good\ngirl! I better get out and help.\"\n\nShe sat straight, shook her head. \"Nope. I'll do it. And I'm not going\nto insist on being heroic any longer. I'll get a farmer to pull us out.\"\n\nAs she let herself down into the ooze, she reflected that all farmers\nhave hearts of gold, anatomical phenomena never found among the snobs\nand hirelings of New York. The nearest heart of gold was presumably\nbeating warmly in the house a quarter of a mile ahead.\n\nShe came up a muddy lane to a muddy farmyard, with a muddy cur yapping\nat her wet legs, and geese hissing in a pool of purest mud serene. The\nhouse was small and rather old. It may have been painted once. The barn\nwas large and new. It had been painted very much, and in a blinding red\nwith white trimmings. There was no brass plate on the house, but on the\nbarn, in huge white letters, was the legend, \"Adolph Zolzac, 1913.\"\n\nShe climbed by log steps to a narrow frame back porch littered with\nparts of a broken cream-separator. She told herself that she was simple\nand friendly in going to the back door instead of the front, and it was\nwith gaiety that she knocked on the ill-jointed screen door, which\nflapped dismally in response.\n\n\"_Ja?_\" from within.\n\nShe rapped again.\n\n\"_Hinein!_\"\n\nShe opened the door on a kitchen, the highlight of which was a table\nheaped with dishes of dumplings and salt pork. A shirt-sleeved man, all\ncovered with mustache and calm, sat by the table, and he kept right on\nsitting as he inquired:\n\n\"Vell?\"\n\n\"My car--my automobile--has been stuck in the mud. A bad driver, I'm\nafraid! I wonder if you would be so good as to----\"\n\n\"I usually get t'ree dollars, but I dunno as I vant to do it for less\nthan four. Today I ain'd feelin' very goot,\" grumbled the\ngolden-hearted.\n\nClaire was aware that a woman whom she had not noticed--so much smaller\nthan the dumplings, so much less vigorous than the salt pork was\nshe--was speaking: \"_Aber_, papa, dot's a shame you sharge de poor young\nlady dot, when she drive by _sei_ self. Vot she t'ink of de Sherman\npeople?\"\n\nThe farmer merely grunted. To Claire, \"Yuh, four dollars. Dot's what I\nusually charge sometimes.\"\n\n\"Usually? Do you mean to say that you leave that hole there in the road\nright along--that people keep on trying to avoid it and get stuck as I\nwas? Oh! If I were an official----\"\n\n\"Vell, I dunno, I don't guess I run my place to suit you smart\nalecks----\"\n\n\"Papa! How you talk on the young lady! Make shame!\"\n\n\"--from the city. If you don't like it, you stay _bei_ Mineapolis! I\nhaul you out for t'ree dollars and a half. Everybody pay dot. Last mont'\nI make forty-five dollars. They vos all glad to pay. They say I help\nthem fine. I don't see vot you're kickin' about! Oh, these vimmins!\"\n\n\"It's blackmail! I wouldn't pay it, if it weren't for my father sitting\nwaiting out there. But--go ahead. Hurry!\"\n\nShe sat tapping her toe while Zolzac completed the stertorous task of\nhogging the dumplings, then stretched, yawned, scratched, and covered\nhis merely dirty garments with overalls that were apparently woven of\nprocessed mud. When he had gone to the barn for his team, his wife came\nto Claire. On her drained face were the easy tears of the slave women.\n\n\"Oh, miss, I don't know vot I should do. My boys go on the public\nschool, and they speak American just so goot as you. Oh, I vant man lets\nme luff America. But papa he says it is an _Unsinn_; you got the money,\nhe says, nobody should care if you are American or Old Country people. I\nshould vish I could ride once in an automobile! But--I am so 'shamed, so\n'shamed that I must sit and see my _Mann_ make this. Forty years I been\nmarried to him, and pretty soon I die----\"\n\nClaire patted her hand. There was nothing to say to tragedy that had\noutlived hope.\n\nAdolph Zolzac clumped out to the highroad behind his vast,\nrolling-flanked horses--so much cleaner and better fed than his wisp of\na wife. Claire followed him, and in her heart she committed murder and\nwas glad of it. While Mr. Boltwood looked out with mild wonder at\nClaire's new friend, Zolzac hitched his team to the axle. It did not\nseem possible that two horses could pull out the car where seventy\nhorsepower had fainted. But, easily, yawning and thinking about dinner,\nthe horses drew the wheels up on the mud-bank, out of the hole and----\n\nThe harness broke, with a flying mess of straps and rope, and the car\nplumped with perfect exactness back into its bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA YOUNG MAN IN A RAINCOAT\n\n\n\"Huh! Such an auto! Look, it break my harness a'ready! Two dollar that\ncost you to mend it. De auto iss too heavy!\" stormed Zolzac.\n\n\"All right! All right! Only for heaven's sake--go get another harness!\"\nClaire shrieked.\n\n\"Fife-fifty dot will be, in all.\" Zolzac grinned.\n\nClaire was standing in front of him. She was thinking of other drivers,\npoor people, in old cars, who had been at the mercy of this\ngolden-hearted one. She stared past him, in the direction from which she\nhad come. Another motor was in sight.\n\nIt was a tin beetle of a car; that agile, cheerful, rut-jumping model\nknown as a \"bug\"; with a home-tacked, home-painted tin cowl and tail\ncovering the stripped chassis of a little cheap Teal car. The lone\ndriver wore an old black raincoat with an atrocious corduroy collar, and\na new plaid cap in the Harry Lauder tartan. The bug skipped through mud\nwhere the Boltwoods' Gomez had slogged and rolled. Its pilot drove up\nbehind her car, and leaped out. He trotted forward to Claire and Zolzac.\nHis eyes were twenty-seven or eight, but his pink cheeks were twenty,\nand when he smiled--shyly, radiantly--he was no age at all, but eternal\nboy. Claire had a blurred impression that she had seen him before, some\nplace along the road.\n\n\"Stuck?\" he inquired, not very intelligently. \"How much is Adolph\ncharging you?\"\n\n\"He wants three-fifty, and his harness broke, and he wants two\ndollars----\"\n\n\"Oh! So he's still working that old gag! I've heard all about Adolph. He\nkeeps that harness for pulling out cars, and it always busts. The last\ntime, though, he only charged six bits to get it mended. Now let me\nreason with him.\"\n\nThe young man turned with vicious quickness, and for the first time\nClaire heard pidgin German--German as it is spoken between Americans who\nhave never learned it, and Germans who have forgotten it:\n\n\"_Schon sex_ hundred times _Ich h\u00c3\u00b6re_ all about the way you been doing\nautos, Zolzac, you _verfluchter Schweinhund_, and I'll set the sheriff\non you----\"\n\n\"Dot ain'd true, maybe _einmal die Woche kommt_ somebody and _Ich muss\ndie Arbeit immer lassen und in die Regen ausgehen, und seh' mal_ how\n_die_ boots _sint mit_ mud covered, two dollars it don't pay for _die_\nboots----\"\n\n\"Now that's enough-plenty out of you, _seien die_ boots _verdammt_, and\n_mach' dass du fort gehst_--muddy boots, hell!--put _mal ein_ egg in\n_die_ boots and beat it, _verleicht_ maybe I'll by golly arrest you\nmyself, _weiss du_! I'm a special deputy sheriff.\"\n\nThe young man stood stockily. He seemed to swell as his somewhat muddy\nhand was shaken directly at, under, and about the circumference of,\nAdolph Zolzac's hairy nose. The farmer was stronger, but he retreated.\nHe took up the reins. He whined, \"Don't I get nothing I break de\nharness?\"\n\n\"Sure. You get ten--years! And you get out!\"\n\nFrom thirty yards up the road, Zolzac flung back, \"You t'ink you're\npretty damn smart!\" That was his last serious reprisal.\n\nClumsily, as one not used to it, the young man lifted his cap to Claire,\nshowing straight, wiry, rope-colored hair, brushed straight back from a\nrather fine forehead. \"Gee, I was sorry to have to swear and holler like\nthat, but it's all Adolph understands. Please don't think there's many\nof the folks around here like him. They say he's the meanest man in the\ncounty.\"\n\n\"I'm immensely grateful to you, but--do you know much about motors? How\ncan I get out of this mud?\"\n\nShe was surprised to see the youngster blush. His clear skin flooded.\nHis engaging smile came again, and he hesitated, \"Let me pull you out.\"\n\nShe looked from her hulking car to his mechanical flea.\n\nHe answered the look: \"I can do it all right. I'm used to the\ngumbo--regular mud-hen. Just add my power to yours. Have you a\ntow-rope?\"\n\n\"No. I never thought of bringing one.\"\n\n\"I'll get mine.\"\n\nShe walked with him back toward his bug. It lacked not only top and\nside-curtains, but even windshield and running-board. It was a toy--a\ncard-board box on toothpick axles. Strapped to the bulging back was a\nwicker suitcase partly covered by tarpaulin. From the seat peered a\nlittle furry face.\n\n\"A cat?\" she exclaimed, as he came up with a wire rope, extracted from\nthe tin back.\n\n\"Yes. She's the captain of the boat. I'm just the engineer.\"\n\n\"What is her name?\"\n\nBefore he answered the young man strode ahead to the front of her car,\nClaire obediently trotting after him. He stooped to look at her front\naxle. He raised his head, glanced at her, and he was blushing again.\n\n\"Her name is Vere de Vere!\" he confessed. Then he fled back to his bug.\nHe drove it in front of the Gomez-Dep. The hole in the road itself was\nas deep as the one on the edge of the cornfield, where she was stuck,\nbut he charged it. She was fascinated by his skill. Where she would for\na tenth of a second have hesitated while choosing the best course, he\nhurled the bug straight at the hole, plunged through with sheets of\nglassy black water arching on either side, then viciously twisted the\ncar to the right, to the left, and straight again, as he followed the\ntracks with the solidest bottoms.\n\nStrapped above the tiny angle-iron step which replaced his running-board\nwas an old spade. He dug channels in front of the four wheels of her\ncar, so that they might go up inclines, instead of pushing against the\nstraight walls of mud they had thrown up. On these inclines he strewed\nthe brush she had brought, halting to ask, with head alertly lifted from\nhis stooped huddle in the mud, \"Did you have to get this brush\nyourself?\"\n\n\"Yes. Horrid wet!\"\n\nHe merely shook his head in commiseration.\n\nHe fastened the tow-rope to the rear axle of his car, to the front of\nhers. \"Now will you be ready to put on all your power as I begin to\npull?\" he said casually, rather respectfully.\n\nWhen the struggling bug had pulled the wire rope taut, she opened the\nthrottle. The rope trembled. Her car seemed to draw sullenly back. Then\nit came out--out--really out, which is the most joyous sensation any\nmotorist shall ever know. In excitement over actually moving again, as\nfast as any healthy young snail, she drove on, on, the young man ahead\ngrinning back at her. Nor did she stop, nor he, till both cars were\nsafe on merely thick mud, a quarter of a mile away.\n\nShe switched off the power--and suddenly she was in a whirlwind of dizzy\nsickening tiredness. Even in her abandonment to exhaustion she noticed\nthat the young man did not stare at her but, keeping his back to her,\nremoved the tow-rope, and stowed it away in his bug. She wondered\nwhether it was tact or yokelish indifference.\n\nHer father spoke for the first time since the Galahad of the tin bug had\ncome: \"How much do you think we ought to give this fellow?\"\n\nNow of all the cosmic problems yet unsolved, not cancer nor the future\nof poverty are the flustering questions, but these twain: Which is\nworse, not to wear evening clothes at a party at which you find every\none else dressed, or to come in evening clothes to a house where, it\nproves, they are never worn? And: Which is worse, not to tip when a tip\nhas been expected; or to tip, when the tip is an insult?\n\nIn discomfort of spirit and wetness of ankles Claire shuddered, \"Oh\ndear, I don't believe he expects us to pay him. He seems like an awfully\nindependent person. Maybe we'd offend him if we offered----\"\n\n\"The only reasonable thing to be offended at in this vale of tears is\nnot being offered money!\"\n\n\"Just the same---- Oh dear, I'm so tired. But good little Claire will\nclimb out and be diplomatic.\"\n\nShe pinched her forehead, to hold in her cracking brain, and wabbled out\ninto new scenes of mud and wetness, but she came up to the young man\nwith the most rain-washed and careless of smiles. \"Won't you come back\nand meet my father? He's terribly grateful to you--as I am. And may\nwe---- You've worked so hard, and about saved our lives. May I pay you\nfor that labor? We're really much indebted----\"\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't anything. Tickled to death if I could help you.\"\n\nHe heartily shook hands with her father, and he droned, \"Pleased to meet\nyou, Mr. Uh.\"\n\n\"Boltwood.\"\n\n\"Mr. Boltwood. My name is Milt--Milton Daggett. See you have a New York\nlicense on your car. We don't see but mighty few of those through here.\nGlad I could help you.\"\n\n\"Ah yes, Mr. Daggett.\" Mr. Boltwood was uninterestedly fumbling in his\nmoney pocket. Behind Milt Daggett, Claire shook her head wildly,\nrattling her hands as though she were playing castanets. Mr. Boltwood\nshrugged. He did not understand. His relations with young men in cheap\nraincoats were entirely monetary. They did something for you, and you\npaid them--preferably not too much--and they ceased to be. Whereas Milt\nDaggett respectfully but stolidly continued to be, and Mr. Henry\nBoltwood's own daughter was halting the march of affairs by asking\nirrelevant questions:\n\n\"Didn't we see you back in--what was that village we came through back\nabout twelve miles?\"\n\n\"Schoenstrom?\" suggested Milt.\n\n\"Yes, I think that was it. Didn't we pass you or something? We stopped\nat a garage there, to change a tire.\"\n\n\"I don't think so. I was in town, though, this morning. Say, uh, did you\nand your father grab any eats----\"\n\n\"A----\"\n\n\"I mean, did you get dinner there?\"\n\n\"No. I wish we had!\"\n\n\"Well say, I didn't either, and--I'd be awfully glad if you folks would\nhave something to eat with me now.\"\n\nClaire tried to give him a smile, but the best she could do was to lend\nhim one. She could not associate interesting food with Milt and his\nmud-slobbered, tin-covered, dun-painted Teal bug. He seemed satisfied\nwith her dubious grimace. By his suggestion they drove ahead to a spot\nwhere the cars could be parked on firm grass beneath oaks. On the way,\nMr. Boltwood lifted his voice in dismay. His touch of nervous\nprostration had not made him queer or violent; he retained a touching\nfaith in good food.\n\n\"We might find some good little hotel and have some chops and just some\nmushrooms and peas,\" insisted the man from Brooklyn Heights.\n\n\"Oh, I don't suppose the country hotels are really so awfully good,\" she\nspeculated. \"And look--that nice funny boy. We couldn't hurt his\nfeelings. He's having so much fun out of being a Good Samaritan.\"\n\nFrom the mysterious rounded back of his car Milt Daggett drew a tiny\nstove, to be heated by a can of solidified alcohol, a frying pan that\nwas rather large for dolls but rather small for square-fingered hands, a\njar of bacon, eggs in a bag, a coffee pot, a can of condensed milk, and\na litter of unsorted tin plates and china cups. While, by his request,\nClaire scoured the plates and cups, he made bacon and eggs and coffee,\nthe little stove in the bottom of his car sheltered by the cook's\nbending over it. The smell of food made Claire forgiving toward the fact\nthat she was wet through; that the rain continued to drizzle down her\nneck.\n\nHe lifted his hand and demanded, \"Take your shoes off!\"\n\n\"Uh?\"\n\nHe gulped. He stammered, \"I mean--I mean your shoes are soaked through.\nIf you'll sit in the car, I'll put your shoes up by the engine. It's\npretty well heated from racing it in the mud. You can get your stockings\ndry under the cowl.\"\n\nShe was amused by the elaborateness with which he didn't glance at her\nwhile she took off her low shoes and slipped her quite too thin black\nstockings under the protecting tin cowl. She reflected, \"He has such a\nnice, awkward gentleness. But such bad taste! They're really quite good\nankles. Apparently ankles are not done, in Teal bug circles. His sisters\ndon't even have limbs. But do fairies have sisters? He is a fairy. When\nI'm out of the mud he'll turn his raincoat into a pair of lordly white\nwings, and vanish. But what will become of the cat?\"\n\nThus her tired brain, like a squirrel in a revolving cage, while she sat\nprimly and scraped at a clot of rust on a tin plate and watched him put\non the bacon and eggs. Wondering if cats were used for this purpose in\nthe Daggett family, she put soaked, unhappy Vere de Vere on her feet, to\nher own great comfort and the cat's delight. It was an open car, and the\nrain still rained, and a strange young man was a foot from her tending\nthe not very crackly fire, but rarely had Claire felt so domestic.\n\nMilt was apparently struggling to say something. After several bobs of\nhis head he ventured, \"You're so wet! I'd like for you to take my\nraincoat.\"\n\n\"No! Really! I'm already soaked through. You keep dry.\"\n\nHe was unhappy about it. He plucked at a button of the coat. She turned\nhim from the subject. \"I hope Lady Vere de Vere is getting warm, too.\"\n\n\"Seems to be. She's kind of demanding. She wanted a little car of her\nown, but I didn't think she could keep up with me, not on a long hike.\"\n\n\"A little car? With her paws on the tiny wheel? Oh--sweet! Are you going\nfar, Mr. Daggett?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite a ways. To Seattle, Washington.\"\n\n\"Oh, really? Extraordinary. We're going there, too.\"\n\n\"Honest? You driving all the way? Oh, no, of course your father----\"\n\n\"No, he doesn't drive. By the way, I hope he isn't too miserable back\nthere.\"\n\n\"I'll be darned. Both of us going to Seattle. That's what they call a\ncoincidence, isn't it! Hope I'll see you on the road, some time. But I\ndon't suppose I will. Once you're out of the mud, your Gomez will simply\nlose my Teal.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. You're the better driver. And I shall take it easy.\nAre you going to stay long in Seattle?\" It was not merely a polite\ndinner-payment question. She wondered; she could not place this\nfresh-cheeked, unworldly young man so far from his home.\n\n\"Why, I kind of hope---- Government railroad, Alaska. I'm going to try\nto get in on that, somehow. I've never been out of Minnesota in my life,\nbut there's couple mountains and oceans and things I thought I'd like\nto see, so I just put my suitcase and Vere de Vere in the machine, and\nstarted out. I burn distillate instead of gas, so it doesn't cost much.\nIf I ever happen to have five whole dollars, why, I might go on to\nJapan!\"\n\n\"That would be jolly.\"\n\n\"Though I s'pose I'd have to eat--what is it?--pickled fish? There's a\nwoman from near my town went to the Orient as a missionary. From what\nshe says, I guess all you need in Japan to make a house is a bottle of\nmucilage and a couple of old newspapers and some two-by-fours. And you\ncan have the house on a purple mountain, with cherry trees down below,\nand----\" He put his clenched hand to his lips. His head was bowed. \"And\nthe ocean! Lord! The ocean! And we'll see it at Seattle. Bay, anyway.\nAnd steamers there--just come from India! Huh! Getting pretty darn\npoetic here! Eggs are done.\"\n\nThe young man did not again wander into visions. He was all briskness as\nhe served her bacon and eggs, took a plate of them to Mr. Boltwood in\nthe Gomez, gouged into his own. Having herself scoured the tin plates,\nClaire was not repulsed by their naked tinniness; and the coffee in the\nbroken-handled china cup was tolerable. Milt drank from the top of a\nvacuum bottle. He was silent. Immediately after the lunch he stowed the\nthings away. Claire expected a drawn-out, tact-demanding farewell, but\nhe climbed into his bug, said \"Good-by, Miss Boltwood. Good luck!\" and\nwas gone.\n\nThe rainy road was bleakly empty without him.\n\nIt did not seem possible that Claire's body could be nagged into going\non any longer. Her muscles were relaxed, her nerves frayed. But the\nmoment the Gomez started, she discovered that magic change which every\nlong-distance motorist knows. Instantly she was alert, seemingly able to\ndrive forever. The pilot's instinct ruled her; gave her tireless eyes\nand sturdy hands. Surely she had never been weary; never would be, so\nlong as it was hers to keep the car going.\n\nShe had driven perhaps six miles when she reached a hamlet called St.\nKlopstock. On the bedraggled mud-and-shanty main street a man was\nloading crushed rock into a truck. By him was a large person in a\nprosperous raincoat, who stepped out, held up his hand. Claire stopped.\n\n\"You the young lady that got stuck in that hole by Adolph Zolzac's?\"\n\n\"Yes. And Mr. Zolzac wasn't very nice about it.\"\n\n\"He's going to be just elegant about it, now, and there ain't going to\nbe any more hole. I think Adolph has been keeping it muddy--throwing in\nsoft dirt--and he made a good and plenty lot out of pulling out\ntourists. Bill and I are going down right now and fill it up with stone.\nMilt Daggett come through here--he's got a nerve, that fellow, but I\ndid have to laugh--he says to me, 'Barney----' This was just now. He\nhasn't more than just drove out of town. He said to me, 'Barney,' he\nsays, 'you're the richest man in this township, and the banker, and you\ngot a big car y'self, and you think you're one whale of a political\nboss,' he says, 'and yet you let that Zolzac maintain a private ocean,\nagainst the peace and damn horrible inconvenience of the Commonwealth of\nMinnesota----' He's got a great line of talk, that fellow. He told me\nhow you got stuck--made me so ashamed--I been to New York myself--and\nright away I got Bill, and we're going down and hold a donation and\nsurprise party on Adolph and fill that hole.\"\n\n\"But won't Adolph dig it out again?\"\n\nThe banker was puffy, but his eyes were of stone. From the truck he took\na shotgun. He drawled, \"In that case, the surprise party will include an\nelegant wake.\"\n\n\"But how did---- Who is this extraordinary Milt Daggett?\"\n\n\"Him? Oh, nobody 'specially. He's just a fellow down here at\nSchoenstrom. But we all know him. Goes to all the dances, thirty miles\naround. Thing about him is: if he sees something wrong, he picks out\nsome poor fellow like me, and says what he thinks.\"\n\nClaire drove on. She was aware that she was looking for Milt's bug. It\nwas not in sight.\n\n\"Father,\" she exclaimed, \"do you realize that this lad didn't tell us he\nwas going to have the hole filled? Just did it. He frightens me. I'm\nafraid that when we reach Gopher Prairie for the night, we'll find he\nhas engaged for us the suite that Prince Collars and Cuffs once slept\nin.\"\n\n\"Hhhhmm,\" yawned her father.\n\n\"Curious young man. He said, 'Pleased to meet you.'\"\n\n\"Huuuuhhm! Fresh air makes me so sleepy.\"\n\n\"And---- Fooled you! Got through that mudhole, anyway! And he said----\nLook! Fields stretch out so here, and not a tree except the\nwillow-groves round those farmhouses. And he said 'Gee' so many times,\nand 'dinner' for the noon meal. And his nails---- No, I suppose he\nreally is just a farm youngster.\"\n\nMr. Boltwood did not answer. His machine-finish smile indicated an\nenormous lack of interest in young men in Teal bugs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA ROOM WITHOUT\n\n\nGopher Prairie has all of five thousand people. Its commercial club\nasserts that it has at least a thousand more population and an\ninfinitely better band than the ridiculously envious neighboring town of\nJoralemon. But there were few signs that a suite had been engaged for\nthe Boltwoods, or that Prince Collars and Cuffs had on his royal tour of\nAmerica spent much time in Gopher Prairie. Claire reached it somewhat\nbefore seven. She gaped at it in a hazy way. Though this was her first\nprairie town for a considerable stay, she could not pump up interest.\n\nThe state of mind of the touring motorist entering a strange place at\nnight is as peculiar and definite as that of a prospector. It is\ncompounded of gratitude at having got safely in; of perception of a new\ntown, yet with all eagerness about new things dulled by weariness; of\nhope that there is going to be a good hotel, but small expectation--and\nabsolutely no probability--that there really will be one.\n\nClaire had only a blotched impression of peaked wooden buildings and\nsquatty brick stores with faded awnings; of a red grain elevator and a\ncrouching station and a lumberyard; then of the hopelessly muddy road\nleading on again into the country. She felt that if she didn't stop at\nonce, she would miss the town entirely. The driving-instinct sustained\nher, made her take corners sharply, spot a garage, send the Gomez\nwhirling in on the cement floor.\n\nThe garage attendant looked at her and yawned.\n\n\"Where do you want the car?\" Claire asked sharply.\n\n\"Oh, stick it in that stall,\" grunted the man, and turned his back.\n\nClaire glowered at him. She thought of a good line about rudeness.\nBut--oh, she was too tired to fuss. She tried to run the car into the\nempty stall, which was not a stall, but a space, like a missing tooth,\nbetween two cars, and so narrow that she was afraid of crumpling the\nlordly fenders of the Gomez. She ran down the floor, returned with a\nflourish, thought she was going to back straight into the stall--and\nfound she wasn't. While her nerves shrieked, and it did not seem\npossible that she could change gears, she managed to get the Gomez\nbehind a truck and side-on to the stall.\n\n\"Go forward again, and cramp your wheel--sharp!\" ordered the garage man.\n\nClaire wanted to outline what she thought of him, but she merely\ndemanded, \"Will you kindly drive it in?\"\n\n\"Why, sure. You bet,\" said the man casually. His readiness ruined her\ninspired fury. She was somewhat disappointed.\n\nAs she climbed out of the car and put a hand on the smart bags strapped\non a running-board, the accumulated weariness struck her in a shock. She\ncould have driven on for hours, but the instant the car was safe for the\nnight, she went to pieces. Her ears rang, her eyes were soaked in fire,\nher mouth was dry, the back of her neck pinched. It was her father who\ntook the lead as they rambled to the one tolerable hotel in the town.\n\nIn the hotel Claire was conscious of the ugliness of the poison-green\nwalls and brass cuspidors and insurance calendars and bare floor of the\noffice; conscious of the interesting scientific fact that all air had\nbeen replaced by the essence of cigar smoke and cooking cabbage; of the\nstares of the traveling men lounging in bored lines; and of the lack of\nwelcome on the part of the night clerk, an oldish, bleached man with\nwhiskers instead of a collar.\n\nShe tried to be important: \"Two rooms with bath, please.\"\n\nThe bleached man stared at her, and shoved forward the register and a\npen clotted with ink. She signed. He took the bags, led the way to the\nstairs. Anxiously she asked, \"Both rooms are with bath?\"\n\nFrom the second step the night clerk looked down at her as though she\nwere a specimen that ought to be pinned on the corks at once, and he\nsaid loudly, \"No, ma'am. Neither of 'em. Got no rooms vacant with bawth,\nor bath either! Not but what we got 'em in the house. This is an\nup-to-date place. But one of 'm's took, and the other has kind of been\nout of order, the last three-four months.\"\n\nFrom the audience of drummers below, a delicate giggle.\n\nClaire was too angry to answer. And too tired. When, after miles of\nstairs, leagues of stuffy hall, she reached her coop, with its iron bed\nso loose-jointed that it rattled to a breath, its bureau with a list to\nport, and its anemic rocking-chair, she dropped on the bed, panting, her\neyes closed but still brimming with fire. It did not seem that she could\never move again. She felt chloroformed. She couldn't even coax herself\noff the bed, to see if her father was any better off in the next room.\n\nShe was certain that she was not going to drive to Seattle. She wasn't\ngoing to drive anywhere! She was going to freight the car back to\nMinneapolis, and herself go back by train--Pullman!--drawing-room!\n\nBut for the thought of her father she would have fallen asleep, in her\ndrenched tweeds. When she did force the energy to rise, she had to\nsupport herself by the bureau, by the foot of the bed, as she moved\nabout the room, hanging up the wet suit, rubbing herself with a slippery\ntowel, putting on a dark silk frock and pumps. She found her father\nsitting motionless in his room, staring at the wall. She made herself\nlaugh at him for his gloomy emptiness. She paraded down the hall with\nhim.\n\nAs they reached the foot of the stairs, the old one, the night clerk\nleaned across the desk and, in a voice that took the whole office into\nthe conversation, quizzed, \"Come from New York, eh? Well, you're quite a\nways from home.\"\n\nClaire nodded. She felt shyer before these solemnly staring traveling\nmen than she ever had in a box at the opera. At the double door of the\ndining-room, from which the cabbage smell steamed with a lustiness\nundiminished by the sad passing of its youth, a man, one of the\naverage-sized, average-mustached, average business-suited,\naverage-brown-haired men who can never be remembered, stopped the\nBoltwoods and hawed, \"Saw you coming into town. You've got a New York\nlicense?\"\n\nShe couldn't deny it.\n\n\"Quite a ways from home, aren't you?\"\n\nShe had to admit it.\n\nShe was escorted by a bouncing, black-eyed waitress to a table for four.\nThe next table was a long one, at which seven traveling men, or local\nbusiness men whose wives were at the lake for the summer, ceased trying\nto get nourishment out of the food, and gawped at her. Before the\nBoltwoods were seated, the waitress dabbed at non-existent spots on\ntheir napkins, ignored a genuine crumb on the cloth in front of Claire's\nplate, made motions at a cup and a formerly plated fork, and bubbled,\n\"Autoing through?\"\n\nClaire fumbled for her chair, oozed into it, and breathed, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Going far?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where do you live?\"\n\n\"New York.\"\n\n\"My! You're quite a ways from home, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Apparently.\"\n\n\"Hamnegs roasbeef roaspork thapplesauce frypickerel springlamintsauce.\"\n\n\"I--I beg your pardon.\"\n\nThe waitress repeated.\n\n\"I--oh--oh, bring us ham and eggs. Is that all right, father?\"\n\n\"Oh--no--well----\"\n\n\"You wanted same?\" the waitress inquired of Mr. Boltwood.\n\nHe was intimidated. He said, \"If you please,\" and feebly pawed at a\nfork.\n\nThe waitress was instantly back with soup, and a collection of china\ngathered by a man of much travel, catholic interests, and no taste. One\nof the plates alleged itself to belong to a hotel in Omaha. She pushed\na pitcher of condensed milk to the exact spot where it would catch Mr.\nBoltwood's sleeve, brushed the crumb from in front of Claire to a\nshelter beneath the pink and warty sugar bowl, recovered a toothpick\nwhich had been concealed behind her glowing lips, picked for a while,\ngave it up, put her hands on her hips, and addressed Claire:\n\n\"How far you going?\"\n\n\"To Seattle.\"\n\n\"Got any folks there?\"\n\n\"Any---- Oh, yes, I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Going to stay there long?\"\n\n\"Really---- We haven't decided.\"\n\n\"Come from New York, eh? Quite a ways from home, all right. Father in\nbusiness there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What's his line?\"\n\n\"I beg pardon?\"\n\n\"What's his line? Ouch! Jiminy, these shoes pinch my feet. I used to\ncould dance all night, but I'm getting fat, I guess, ha! ha! Put on\nseven pounds last month. Ouch! Gee, they certainly do pinch my toes.\nWhat business you say your father's in?\"\n\n\"I didn't say, but---- Oh, railroad.\"\n\n\"G. N. or N. P.?\"\n\n\"I don't think I quite understand----\"\n\nMr. Boltwood interposed, \"Are the ham and eggs ready?\"\n\n\"I'll beat it out and see.\" When she brought them, she put a spoon in\nClaire's saucer of peas, and demanded, \"Say, you don't wear that silk\ndress in the auto, do you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I should think you'd put a pink sash on it. Seems like it's kind of\nplain--it's a real pretty piece of goods, though. A pink sash would be\nreal pretty. You dark-complected ladies always looks better for a touch\nof color.\"\n\nThen was Claire certain that the waitress was baiting her, for the\namusement of the men at the long table. She exploded. Probably the\nwaitress did not know there had been an explosion when Claire looked\ncoldly up, raised her brows, looked down, and poked the cold and salty\nslab of ham, for she was continuing:\n\n\"A light-complected lady like me don't need so much color, you notice my\nhair is black, but I'm light, really, Pete Liverquist says I'm a blonde\nbrunette, gee, he certainly is killing that fellow, oh, he's a case, he\nsure does like to hear himself talk, my! there's Old Man Walters, he\nruns the telephone exchange here, I heard he went down to St. Cloud on\nNumber 2, but I guess he couldn't of, he'll be yodeling for friend soup\nand a couple slabs of moo, I better beat it, I'll say so, so long.\"\n\nClaire's comment was as acid as the pale beets before her, as bitter as\nthe peas, as hard as the lumps in the watery mashed potatoes:\n\n\"I don't know whether the woman is insane or ignorant. I wish I could\ntell whether she was trying to make me angry for the benefit of those\nhorrid unshaven men, or merely for her private edification.\"\n\n\"By me, dolly. So is this pie. Let's get some medium to levitate us up\nto bed. Uh--uh---- I think perhaps we'd better not try to drive clear to\nSeattle. If we just went through to Montana?--or even just to Bismarck?\"\n\n\"Drive through with the hotels like this? My dear man, if we have one\nmore such day, we stop right there. I hope we get by the man at the\ndesk. I have a feeling he's lurking there, trying to think up something\ninsulting to say to us. Oh, my dear, I hope you aren't as beastly tired\nas I am. My bones are hot pokers.\"\n\nThe man at the desk got in only one cynical question, \"Driving far?\"\nbefore Claire seized her father's arm and started him upstairs.\n\nFor the first time since she had been ten--and in a state of naughtiness\nimmediately following a pronounced state of grace induced by the pulpit\noratory of the new rector of St. Chrysostom's--she permitted herself the\nluxury of not stopping to brush her teeth before she went to bed. Her\nsleep was drugged--it was not sleep, but an aching exhaustion of the\nbody which did not prevent her mind from revisualizing the road, going\nstupidly over the muddy stretches and sharp corners, then becoming\nconscious of that bed, the lump under her shoulder blades, the slope to\nwestward, and the creak that rose every time she tossed. For at least\nfifteen minutes she lay awake for hours.\n\nThus Claire Boltwood's first voyage into democracy.\n\nIt was not so much that the sun was shining, in the morning, as that a\nripple of fresh breeze came through the window. She discovered that she\nagain longed to go on--keep going on--see new places, conquer new roads.\nShe didn't want all good road. She wanted something to struggle against.\nShe'd try it for one more day. She was stiff as she crawled out of bed,\nbut a rub with cold water left her feeling that she was stronger than\nshe ever had been; that she was a woman, not a dependent girl. Already,\nin the beating prairie sun-glare, the wide main street of Gopher Prairie\nwas drying; the mud ruts flattening out. Beyond the town hovered the\nnote of a meadow lark--sunlight in sound.\n\n\"Oh, it's a sweet morning! Sweet! We will go on! I'm terribly excited!\"\nshe laughed.\n\nShe found her father dressed. He did not know whether or not he wanted\nto go on. \"I seem to have lost my grip on things. I used to be rather\ndecisive. But we'll try it one more day, if you like,\" he said.\n\nWhen she had gaily marched him downstairs, she suddenly and unhappily\nremembered the people she would have to face, the gibing questions she\nwould have to answer.\n\nThe night clerk was still at the desk, as though he had slept standing.\nHe hailed them. \"Well, well! Up bright and early! Hope you folks slept\nwell. Beds aren't so good as they might be, but we're kind of planning\nto get some new mattresses. But you get pretty good air to sleep in.\nHope you have a fine hike today.\"\n\nHis voice was cordial; he was their old friend; faithful watcher of\ntheir progress. Claire found herself dimpling at him.\n\nIn the dining-room their inquisitional acquaintance, the waitress,\nfairly ran to them. \"Sit down, folks. Waffles this morning. You want to\nstock up for your drive. My, ain't it an elegant morning! I hope you\nhave a swell drive today!\"\n\n\"Why!\" Claire gasped, \"why, they aren't rude. They care--about people\nthey never saw before. That's why they ask questions! I never thought--I\nnever thought! There's people in the world who want to know us without\nhaving looked us up in the Social Register! I'm so ashamed! Not that the\nsunshine changes my impression of this coffee. It's frightful! But that\nwill improve. And the people--they were being friendly, all the time.\nOh, Henry B., young Henry Boltwood, you and your godmother Claire have\na lot to learn about the world!\"\n\nAs they came into the garage, their surly acquaintance of the night\nbefore looked just as surly, but Claire tried a boisterous \"Good\nmorning!\"\n\n\"Mornin'! Going north? Better take the left-hand road at Wakamin. Easier\ngoing. Drive your car out for you?\"\n\nAs the car stood outside taking on gas, a man flapped up, spelled out\nthe New York license, looked at Claire and her father, and inquired,\n\"Quite a ways from home, aren't you?\"\n\nThis time Claire did not say \"Yes!\" She experimented with, \"Yes, quite a\nways.\"\n\n\"Well, hope you have a good trip. Good luck!\"\n\nClaire leaned her head on her hand, thought hard. \"It's I who wasn't\nfriendly,\" she propounded to her father. \"How much I've been losing.\nThough I still refuse to like that coffee!\"\n\nShe noticed the sign on the air-hose of the garage--\"Free Air.\"\n\n\"There's our motto for the pilgrimage!\" she cried.\n\nShe knew the exaltation of starting out in the fresh morning for places\nshe had never seen, without the bond of having to return at night.\n\nThus Claire's second voyage into democracy.\n\nWhile she was starting the young man who had pulled her out of the mud\nand given her lunch was folding up the tarpaulin and blankets on which\nhe had slept beside his Teal bug, in the woods three miles north of\nGopher Prairie. To the high-well-born cat, Vere de Vere, Milt Daggett\nmused aloud, \"Your ladyship, as Shakespeare says, the man that gets cold\nfeet never wins the girl. And I'm scared, cat, clean scared.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nRELEASE BRAKES--SHIFT TO THIRD\n\n\nMilt Daggett had not been accurate in his implication that he had not\nnoticed Claire at a garage in Schoenstrom. For one thing, he owned the\ngarage.\n\nMilt was the most prosperous young man in the village of Schoenstrom.\nNeither the village itself nor the nearby _Strom_ is really _schoen_.\nThe entire business district of Schoenstrom consists of Heinie\nRauskukle's general store, which is brick; the Leipzig House, which is\nframe; the Old Home Poolroom and Restaurant, which is of old logs\nconcealed by a frame sheathing; the farm-machinery agency, which is\ngalvanized iron, its roof like an enlarged washboard; the church; the\nthree saloons; and the Red Trail Garage, which is also, according to\nvarious signs, the Agency for Teal Car Best at the Test, Stonewall Tire\nService Station, Sewing Machines and Binders Repaired, Dr. Hostrum the\nVeterinarian every Thursday, Gas Today 27c.\n\nThe Red Trail Garage is of cement and tapestry brick. In the office is a\nclean hardwood floor, a typewriter, and a picture of Elsie Ferguson. The\nestablishment has an automatic rim-stretcher, a wheel jack, and a\nreputation for honesty.\n\nThe father of Milt Daggett was the Old Doctor, born in Maine, coming to\nthis frontier in the day when Chippewas camped in your dooryard, and\ncame in to help themselves to coffee, which you made of roasted corn.\nThe Old Doctor bucked northwest blizzards, read Dickens and Byron,\npulled people through typhoid, and left to Milt his shabby old medicine\ncase and thousands of dollars--in uncollectible accounts. Mrs. Daggett\nhad long since folded her crinkly hands in quiet death.\n\nMilt had covered the first two years of high school by studying with the\npriest, and been sent to the city of St. Cloud for the last two years.\nHis father had meant to send him to the state university. But Milt had\nbeen born to a talent for machinery. At twelve he had made a telephone\nthat worked. At eighteen he was engineer in the tiny flour mill in\nSchoenstrom. At twenty-five, when Claire Boltwood chose to come tearing\nthrough his life in a Gomez-Dep, Milt was the owner, manager,\nbookkeeper, wrecking crew, ignition expert, thoroughly competent\nbill-collector, and all but one of the working force of the Red Trail\nGarage.\n\nThere were two factions in Schoenstrom: the retired farmers who said\nthat German was a good enough language for anybody, and that taxes for\nschools and sidewalks were yes something crazy; and the group who\nstated that a pig-pen is a fine place, but only for pigs. To this\nsecond, revolutionary wing belonged a few of the first generation, most\nof the second, and all of the third; and its leader was Milt Daggett. He\ndid not talk much, normally, but when he thought things ought to be\ndone, he was as annoying as a machine-gun test in the lot next to a\nQuaker meeting.\n\nIf there had been a war, Milt would probably have been in it--rather\ncasual, clearing his throat, reckoning and guessing that maybe his men\nmight try going over and taking that hill ... then taking it. But all of\nthis history concerns the year just before America spoke to Germany; and\nin this town buried among the cornfields and the wheat, men still\nthought more about the price of grain than about the souls of nations.\n\nOn the evening before Claire Boltwood left Minneapolis and adventured\ninto democracy, Milt was in the garage. He wore union overalls that were\ntan where they were not grease-black; a faded blue cotton shirt; and the\ncrown of a derby, with the rim not too neatly hacked off with a dull\ntoad-stabber jack-knife.\n\nMilt smiled at his assistant, Ben Sittka, and suggested, \"Well, _wie\ngeht 's mit_ the work, eh? Like to stay and get the prof's flivver out,\nso he can have it in the morning?\"\n\n\"You bet, boss.\"\n\n\"Getting to be quite a mechanic, Ben.\"\n\n\"I'll say so!\"\n\n\"If you get stuck, come yank me out of the Old Home.\"\n\n\"Aw rats, boss. I'll finish it. You beat it.\" Ben grinned at Milt\nadoringly.\n\nMilt stripped off his overalls and derby-crown, and washed his big, firm\nhands with gritty soft soap. He cleaned his nails with a file which he\ncarried in his upper vest pocket in a red imitation morocco case which\ncontained a comb, a mirror, an indelible pencil, and a note-book with\nthe smudged pencil addresses of five girls in St. Cloud, and a\nmemorandum about Rauskukle's car.\n\nHe put on a twisted brown tie, an old blue serge suit, and a hat which,\nbeing old and shabby, had become graceful. He ambled up the street. He\ncouldn't have ambled more than three blocks and have remained on the\nstreet. Schoenstrom tended to leak off into jungles of tall corn.\n\nTwo men waved at him, and one demanded, \"Say, Milt, is whisky good for\nthe toothache? What d' you think! The doc said it didn't do any good.\nBut then, gosh, he's only just out of college.\"\n\n\"I guess he's right.\"\n\n\"Is that a fact! Well, I'll keep off it then.\"\n\nTwo stores farther on, a bulky farmer hailed, \"Say, Milt, should I get\nan ensilage cutter yet?\"\n\n\"Yuh,\" in the manner of a man who knows too much to be cocksure about\nanything, \"I don't know but what I would, Julius.\"\n\n\"I guess I vill then.\"\n\nMinnie Rauskukle, plump, hearty Minnie, heiress to the general store,\ngave evidence by bridling and straightening her pigeon-like body that\nshe was aware of Milt behind her. He did not speak to her. He ducked\ninto the door of the Old Home Poolroom and Restaurant.\n\nMilt ranged up to the short lunch counter, in front of the pool table\nwhere two brick-necked farm youngsters were furiously slamming balls and\nattacking cigarettes. Loose-jointedly Milt climbed a loose-jointed high\nstool and to the proprietor, Bill McGolwey, his best friend, he yawned,\n\"You might poison me with a hamburger and a slab of apple, Mac.\"\n\n\"I'll just do that little thing. Look kind of grouchy tonight, Milt.\"\n\n\"Too much excitement in this burg. Saw three people on the streets all\nsimultaneously to-once.\"\n\n\"What's been eatin' you lately?\"\n\n\"Me? Nothing. Only I do get tired of this metropolis. One of these days\nI'm going to buck some bigger place.\"\n\n\"Try Gopher Prairie maybe?\" suggested Mac, through the hiss and steam of\nthe frying hamburger sandwich.\n\n\"Rats. Too small.\"\n\n\"Small? Why, there's darn near five thousand people there!\"\n\n\"I know, but--I want to tackle some sure-nuff city. Like Duluth or New\nYork.\"\n\n\"But what'd you do?\"\n\n\"That's the devil of it. I don't know just what I do want to do. I could\nalways land soft in a garage, but that's nothing new. Might hit Detroit,\nand learn the motor-factory end.\"\n\n\"Aw, you're the limit, Milt. Always looking for something new.\"\n\n\"That's the way to get on. The rest of this town is afraid of new\nthings. 'Member when I suggested we all chip in on a dynamo with a gas\nengine and have electric lights? The hicks almost died of nervousness.\"\n\n\"Yuh, that's true, but---- You stick here, Milt. You and me will just\nnachly run this burg.\"\n\n\"I'll say! Only---- Gosh, Mac, I would like to go to a real show, once.\nAnd find out how radio works. And see 'em put in a big suspension\nbridge!\"\n\nMilt left the Old Home rather aimlessly. He told himself that he\npositively would not go back and help Ben Sittka get out the prof's car.\nSo he went back and helped Ben get out the prof's car, and drove the\nsame to the prof's. The prof, otherwise professor, otherwise mister,\nJames Martin Jones, B.A., and Mrs. James Martin Jones welcomed him\nalmost as noisily as had Mac. They begged him to come in. With Mr.\nJones he discussed--no, ye Claires of Brooklyn Heights, this garage man\nand this threadbare young superintendent of a paintbare school, talking\nin a town that was only a comma on the line, did not discuss\ncorn-growing, nor did they reckon to guess that by heck the constabule\nwas carryin' on with the Widdy Perkins. They spoke of fish-culture,\nElihu Root, the spiritualistic evidences of immortality, government\nownership, self-starters for flivvers, and the stories of Irvin Cobb.\n\nMilt went home earlier than he wanted to. Because Mr. Jones was the only\nman in town besides the priest who read books, because Mrs. Jones was\nthe only woman who laughed about any topics other than children and\nfamily sickness, because he wanted to go to their house every night,\nMilt treasured his welcome as a sacred thing, and kept himself from\ncalling on them more than once a week.\n\nHe stopped on his way to the garage to pet Emil Baumschweiger's large\ngray cat, publicly known as Rags, but to Milt and to the lady herself\nrecognized as the unfortunate Countess Vere de Vere--perhaps the only\nperson of noble ancestry and mysterious past in Milt's acquaintance. The\nBaumschweigers did not treat their animals well; Emil kicked the bay\nmare, and threw pitchforks at Vere de Vere. Milt saluted her and\nsympathized:\n\n\"You have a punk time, don't you, countess? Like to beat it to\nMinneapolis with me?\"\n\nThe countess said that she did indeed have an extraordinarily punk time,\nand she sang to Milt the hymn of the little gods of the warm hearth.\nThen Milt's evening dissipations were over. Schoenstrom has movies only\nonce a week. He sat in the office of his garage ruffling through a\nweekly digest of events. Milt read much, though not too easily. He had\nno desire to be a poet, an Indo-Iranian etymologist, a lecturer to\nwomen's clubs, or the secretary of state. But he did rouse to the\nmarvels hinted in books and magazines; to large crowds, the mechanism of\nsubmarines, palm trees, gracious women.\n\nHe laid down the magazine. He stared at the wall. He thought about\nnothing. He seemed to be fumbling for something about which he could\ndeliciously think if he could but grasp it. Without quite visualizing\neither wall or sea, he was yet recalling old dreams of a moonlit wall by\na warm stirring southern sea. If there was a girl in the dream she was\nintangible as the scent of the night. Presently he was asleep, a not at\nall romantic figure, rather ludicrously tipped to one side in his office\nchair, his large solid shoes up on the desk.\n\nHe half woke, and filtered to what he called home--one room in the\ncottage of an oldish woman who had prejudices against the perilous night\nair. He was too sleepy to go through any toilet save pulling off his\nshoes, and achieving an unconvincing wash at the little stand, whose\ncrackly varnish was marked with white rings from the toothbrush mug.\n\n\"I feel about due to pull off some fool stunt. Wonder what it will be?\"\nhe complained, as he flopped on the bed.\n\nHe was up at six, and at a quarter to seven was at work in the garage.\nHe spent a large part of the morning in trying to prove to a customer\nthat even a Teal car, best at the test, would not give perfect service\nif the customer persisted in forgetting to fill the oil-well, the\ngrease-cups, and the battery.\n\nAt three minutes after twelve Milt left the garage to go to dinner. The\nfog of the morning had turned to rain. McGolwey was not at the Old Home.\nSometimes Mac got tired of serving meals, and for a day or two he took\nto a pocket flask, and among his former customers the cans of prepared\nmeat at Rauskukle's became popular. Milt found him standing under the\ntin awning of the general store. He had a troubled hope of keeping Mac\nfrom too long a vacation with the pocket flask. But Mac was already\nred-eyed. He seemed only half to recognize Milt.\n\n\"Swell day!\" said Milt.\n\n\"Y' bet.\"\n\n\"Road darn muddy.\"\n\n\"I should worry. Yea, bo', I'm feelin' good!\"\n\nAt eleven minutes past twelve a Gomez-Dep roadster appeared down the\nroad, stopped at the garage. To Milt it was as exciting as the\nappearance of a comet to a watching astronomer.\n\n\"What kind of a car do you call that, Milt?\" asked a loafer.\n\n\"Gomez-Deperdussin.\"\n\n\"Never heard of it. Looks too heavy.\"\n\nThis was sacrilege. Milt stormed, \"Why, you poor floof, it's one of the\nbest cars in the world. Imported from France. That looks like a\nspecial-made American body, though. Trouble with you fellows is, you're\nalways scared of anything that's new. Too--heavy! Huh! Always wanted to\nsee a Gomez--never have, except in pictures. And I believe that's a New\nYork license. Let me at it!\"\n\nHe forgot noon-hunger, and clumped through the rain to the garage. He\nsaw a girl step from the car. He stopped, in the doorway of the Old\nHome, in uneasy shyness. He told himself he didn't \"know just what it is\nabout her--she isn't so darn unusually pretty and yet--gee---- Certainly\nisn't a girl to get fresh with. Let Ben take care of her. Like to talk\nto her, and yet I'd be afraid if I opened my mouth, I'd put my foot in\nit.\"\n\nHe was for the first time seeing a smart woman. This dark, slender,\nfine-nerved girl, in her plain, rough, closely-belted, gray suit, her\nsmall black Glengarry cocked on one side of her smooth hair, her little\nkid gloves, her veil, was as delicately adjusted as an aeroplane engine.\n\nMilt wanted to trumpet her exquisiteness to the world, so he growled to\na man standing beside him, \"Swell car. Nice-lookin' girl, kind of.\"\n\n\"Kind of skinny, though. I like 'em with some meat on 'em,\" yawned the\nman.\n\nNo, Milt did not strike him to earth. He insisted feebly, \"Nice clothes\nshe's got, though.\"\n\n\"Oh, not so muchamuch. I seen a woman come through here yesterday that\nwas swell, though--had on a purple dress and white shoes and a hat big\n's a bushel.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know, I kind of like those simple things,\" apologized\nMilt.\n\nHe crept toward the garage. The girl was inside. He inspected the\nslope-topped, patent-leather motoring trunk on the rack at the rear of\nthe Gomez-Dep. He noticed a middle-aged man waiting in the car. \"Must be\nher father. Probably--maybe she isn't married then.\" He could not get\nhimself to shout at the man, as he usually did. He entered the garage\noffice; from the inner door he peeped at the girl, who was talking to\nhis assistant about changing an inner tube.\n\nThat Ben Sittka whom an hour ago he had cajoled as a promising child he\nnow admired for the sniffing calmness with which he was demanding,\n\"Want a red or gray tube?\"\n\n\"Really, I don't know. Which is the better?\" The girl's voice was\ncuriously clear.\n\nMilt passed Claire Boltwood as though he did not see her; stood at the\nrear of the garage kicking at the tires of a car, his back to her. Over\nand over he was grumbling, \"If I just knew one girl like that---- Like a\npicture. Like--like a silver vase on a blue cloth!\"\n\nBen Sittka did not talk to the girl while he inserted the tube in the\nspare casing. Only, in the triumphant moment when the parted ends of the\nsteel rim snapped back together, he piped, \"Going far?\"\n\n\"Yes, rather. To Seattle.\"\n\nMilt stared at the cobweb-grayed window. \"Now I know what I was planning\nto do. I'm going to Seattle,\" he said.\n\nThe girl was gone at twenty-nine minutes after twelve. At twenty-nine\nand a half minutes after, Milt remarked to Ben Sittka, \"I'm going to\ntake a trip. Uh? Now don't ask questions. You take charge of the garage\nuntil you hear from me. Get somebody to help you. G'-by.\"\n\nHe drove his Teal bug out of the garage. At thirty-two minutes after\ntwelve he was in his room, packing his wicker suitcase by the method of\nthrowing things in and stamping on the case till it closed. In it he\nhad absolutely all of his toilet refinements and wardrobe except the\nimportant portion already in use. They consisted, according to faithful\ndetailed report, of four extra pairs of thick yellow and white cotton\nsocks; two shirts, five collars, five handkerchiefs; a pair of\nsurprisingly vain dancing pumps; high tan laced boots; three suits of\ncheap cotton underclothes; his Sunday suit, which was dead black in\ncolor, and unimaginative in cut; four ties; a fagged toothbrush, a comb\nand hairbrush, a razor, a strop, shaving soap in a mug; a not very clean\ntowel; and nothing else whatever.\n\nTo this he added his entire library and private picture gallery,\nconsisting of Ivanhoe, Ben-Hur, his father's copy of Byron, a wireless\nmanual, and the 1916 edition of Motor Construction and Repairing: the\nart collection, one colored Sunday supplement picture of a princess\nlunching in a Proven\u00c3\u00a7e courtyard, and a half-tone of Colonel Paul Beck\nlanding in an early military biplane. Under this last, in a pencil\nscrawl now blurred to grayness, Milt had once written, \"This what Ill be\naviator.\"\n\nWhat he was to wear was a piercing trouble. Till eleven minutes past\ntwelve that day he had not cared. People accepted his overalls at\nanything except a dance, and at the dances he was the only one who wore\npumps. But in his discovery of Claire Boltwood he had perceived that\ndressing is an art. Before he had packed, he had unhappily pawed at the\nprized black suit. It had become stupid. \"Undertaker!\" he growled.\n\nWith a shrug which indicated that he had nothing else, he had exchanged\nhis overalls for a tan flannel shirt, black bow tie, thick pigskin\nshoes, and the suit he had worn the evening before, his best suit of two\nyears ago--baggy blue serge coat and trousers. He could not know it, but\nthey were surprisingly graceful on his wiry, firm, white body.\n\nIn his pockets were a roll of bills and an unexpectedly good gold watch.\nFor warmth he had a winter ulster, an old-fashioned turtle-neck sweater,\nand a raincoat heavy as tarpaulin. He plunged into the raincoat, ran\nout, galloped to Rauskukle's store, bought the most vehement cap in the\nplace--a plaid of cerise, orange, emerald green, ultramarine, and five\nother guaranteed fashionable colors. He stocked up with food for\nroadside camping.\n\nIn the humping tin-covered tail of the bug was a good deal of room, and\nthis he filled with motor extras, a shotgun and shells, a pair of\nskates, and all his camping kit as used on his annual duck-hunting trip\nto Man Trap Lake.\n\n\"I'm a darned fool to take everything I own but---- Might be gone a\nwhole month,\" he reflected.\n\nHe had only one possession left--a check book, concealed from the\ninterested eye of his too maternal landlady by sticking it under the\nstair carpet. This he retrieved. It showed a balance of two hundred\ndollars. There was ten dollars in the cash register in the office, for\nBen Sittka. The garage would, with the mortgage deducted, be worth\nnearly two thousand. This was his fortune.\n\nHe bolted into the kitchen and all in one shout he informed his\nlandlady, \"Called out of town, li'l trip, b'lieve I don't owe you\nan'thing, here's six dollars, two weeks' notice, dunno just when I be\nback.\"\n\nBefore she could issue a questionnaire he was out in the bug. He ran\nthrough town. At his friend McGolwey; now loose-lipped and wabbly,\nsitting in the rain on a pile of ties behind the railroad station, he\nyelled, \"So long, Mac. Take care yourself, old hoss. Off on li'l trip.\"\n\nHe stopped in front of the \"prof's,\" tooted till the heads of the\nJoneses appeared at the window, waved and shouted, \"G'-by, folks. Goin'\nouta town.\"\n\nThen, while freedom and the distant Pacific seemed to rush at him over\nthe hood, he whirled out of town. It was two minutes to one--forty-seven\nminutes since Claire Boltwood had entered Schoenstrom.\n\nHe stopped only once. His friend Lady Vere de Vere was at the edge of\ntown, on a scientific exploring trip in the matter of ethnology and\nfield mice. She hailed him, \"Mrwr? Me mrwr!\"\n\n\"You don't say so!\" Milt answered in surprise. \"Well, if I promised to\ntake you, I'll keep my word.\" He vaulted out, tucked Vere de Vere into\nthe seat, protecting her from the rain with the tarpaulin winter\nradiator-cover.\n\nHis rut-skipping car overtook the mud-walloping Gomez-Dep in an hour,\nand pulled it out of the mud.\n\nBefore Milt slept that night, in his camp three miles from Gopher\nPrairie, he went through religious rites.\n\n\"Girl like her, she's darn particular about her looks. I'm a sloppy\nhound. Used to be snappier about my clothes when I was in high school.\nGetting lazy--too much like Mac. Think of me sleeping in my clothes last\nnight!\"\n\n\"Mrwr!\" rebuked the cat.\n\n\"You're dead right. Fierce is the word. Nev' will sleep in my duds\nagain, puss. That is, when I have a reg'lar human bed. Course camping,\ndifferent. But still---- Let's see all the funny things we can do to\nus.\"\n\nHe shaved--two complete shaves, from lather to towel. He brushed his\nhair. He sat down by a campfire sheltered between two rocks, and fought\nhis nails, though they were discouragingly crammed with motor grease.\nThroughout this interesting but quite painful ceremony Milt kept up a\nconversation between himself as the World's Champion Dude, and his cat\nas Vallay. But when there was nothing more to do, and the fire was low,\nand Vere de Vere asleep in the sleeve of the winter ulster, his\nbumbling voice slackened; in something like agony he muttered:\n\n\"But oh, what's the use? I can't ever be anything but a dub! Cleaning my\nnails, to make a hit with a girl that's got hands like hers! It's a long\ntrail to Seattle, but it's a darn sight longer one to being--being--well,\nsophisticated. Oh! And incidentally, what the deuce am I going to do in\nSeattle if I do get there?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE LAND OF BILLOWING CLOUDS\n\n\nNever a tawny-beached ocean has the sweetness of the prairie slew.\nRippling and blue, with long grass up to its edge, a spot of dancing\nlight set in the miles of rustling wheat, it retains even in July, on an\nafternoon of glare and brazen locusts, the freshness of a spring\nmorning. A thousand slews, a hundred lakes bordered with rippling barley\nor tinkling bells of the flax, Claire passed. She had left the\noccasional groves of oak and poplar and silver birch, and come out on\nthe treeless Great Plains.\n\nShe had learned to call the slews \"pugholes,\" and to watch for ducks at\ntwilight. She had learned that about the pugholes flutter choirs of\ncrimson-winged blackbirds; that the ugly brown birds squatting on\nfence-rails were the divine-voiced meadow larks; that among the humble\ncowbird citizens of the pastures sometimes flaunted a scarlet tanager or\nan oriole; and that no rose garden has the quaint and hardy beauty of\nthe Indian paint brushes and rag babies and orange milkweed in the\nprickly, burnt-over grass between roadside and railway line.\n\nShe had learned that what had seemed rudeness in garage men and hotel\nclerks was often a resentful reflection of her own Eastern attitude\nthat she was necessarily superior to a race she had been trained to call\n\"common people.\" If she spoke up frankly, they made her one of their\nown, and gave her companionable aid.\n\nFor two days of sunshine and drying mud she followed a road flung\nstraight across flat wheatlands, then curving among low hills. Often\nthere were no fences; she was so intimately in among the grain that the\nfenders of the car brushed wheat stalks, and she became no stranger, but\na part of all this vast-horizoned land. She forgot that she was driving,\nas she let the car creep on, while she was transported by Armadas of\nclouds, prairie clouds, wisps of vapor like a ribbed beach, or mounts of\ncumulus swelling to gold-washed snowy peaks.\n\nThe friendliness of the bearing earth gave her a calm that took no heed\nof passing hours. Even her father, the abstracted man of affairs, nodded\nto dusty people along the road; to a jolly old man whose bulk rolled and\nshook in a tiny, rhythmically creaking buggy, to women in the small\nabrupt towns with their huge red elevators and their long, flat-roofed\nstores.\n\nClaire had discovered America, and she felt stronger, and all her days\nwere colored with the sun.\n\nShe had discovered, too, that she could adventure. No longer was she\nhaunted by the apprehension that had whispered to her as she had left\nMinneapolis. She knew a thrill when she hailed--as though it were a\npassing ship--an Illinois car across whose dust-caked back was a banner\n\"Chicago to the Yellowstone.\" She experienced a new sensation of common\nhumanness when, on a railway paralleling the wagon road for miles, the\nengineer of a freight waved his hand to her, and tooted the whistle in\ngreeting.\n\nHer father was easily tired, but he drowsed through the early afternoons\nwhen a none-too-digestible small-town lunch was as lead within him.\nDespite the beauty of the land and the joy of pushing on, they both had\nthings to endure.\n\nAfter lunch, it was sometimes an agony to Claire to keep awake. Her eyes\nfelt greasy from the food, or smarted with the sun-glare. In the still\nair, after the morning breeze had been burnt out, the heat from the\nengine was a torment about her feet; and if there was another car ahead,\nthe trail of dust sifted into her throat. Unless there was traffic to\nkeep her awake, she nodded at the wheel; she was merely a part of a\nmachine that ran on without seeming to make any impression on the\nprairie's endlessness.\n\nOver and over there were the same manipulations: slow for down hill,\ncareful of sand at the bottom, letting her out on a smooth stretch,\nwaving to a lonely farmwife in her small, baked dooryard, slow to pass a\nhay-wagon, gas for up the next hill, and repeat the round all over\nagain. But she was joyous till noon; and with mid-afternoon a new\nstrength came which, as rose crept above the golden haze of dust,\ndeepened into serene meditation.\n\nAnd she was finding the one secret of long-distance driving--namely,\ndriving; keeping on, thinking by fifty-mile units, not by the ten-mile\nstretches of Long Island runs; and not fretting over anything whatever.\nShe seemed charmed; if she had a puncture--why, she put on the spare. If\nshe ran out of gas--why, any passing driver would lend her a gallon.\nNothing, it seemed, could halt her level flight across the giant land.\n\nShe rarely lost her way. She was guided by the friendly trail\nsigns--those big red R's and L's on fence post and telephone pole,\nmagically telling the way from the Mississippi to the Pacific.\n\nHer father's occasional musing talk kept her from loneliness. He was a\ngood touring companion. Motoring is not the best occasion for epigrams,\nsatire, and the Good One You Got Off at the Lambs' Club last night. Such\nverbiage on motor trips invariably results in the mysterious finding of\nthe corpse of a strange man, well dressed, hidden beside the road.\nClaire and her father mumbled, \"Good farmhouse--brick,\" or \"Nice view,\"\nand smiled, and were for miles as silent as the companionable sky.\n\nShe thought of the people she knew, especially of Jeff Saxton. But she\ncould not clearly remember his lean earnest face. Between her and Jeff\nwere sweeping sunny leagues. But she was not lonely. Certainly she was\nnot lonely for a young man with a raincoat, a cat, and an interest in\nJapan.\n\nNo singer after a first concert has felt more triumphant than Claire\nwhen she crossed her first state-line; rumbled over the bridge across\nthe Red River into North Dakota. To see Dakota car licenses everywhere,\ninstead of Minnesota, was like the sensation of street signs in a new\nlanguage. And when she found a good hotel in Fargo and had a real bath,\nshe felt that by her own efforts she had earned the right to enjoy it.\n\nMr. Boltwood caught her enthusiasm. Dinner was a festival, and in iced\ntea the peaceful conquistadores drank the toast of the new Spanish Main;\nand afterward, arm in arm, went chattering to the movies.\n\nIn front of the Royal Palace, Pictures, 4 Great Acts Vaudeville 4, was\nbrowsing a small, beetle-like, tin-covered car.\n\n\"Dad! Look! I'm sure--yes, of course, there's his suitcase--that's the\ncar of that nice boy--don't you remember?--the one that pulled us out of\nthe mud at--I don't remember the name of the place. Apparently he's\nkeeping going. I remember; he's headed for Seattle, too. We'll look for\nhim in the theater. Oh, the darling, there's his cat! What was the funny\nname he gave her--the Marchioness Montmorency or something?\"\n\nLady Vere de Vere, afraid of Fargo and movie crowds, but trusting in her\nitinerant castle, the bug, was curled in Milt Daggett's ulster, in the\nbottom of the car. She twinkled her whiskers at Claire, and purred to a\nstroking hand.\n\nWith the excitement of one trying to find the address of a friend in a\nstrange land Claire looked over the audience when the lights came on\nbefore the vaudeville. In the second row she saw Milt's stiffish,\nrope-colored hair--surprisingly smooth above an astoundingly clean new\ntan shirt of mercerized silk.\n\nHe laughed furiously at the dialogue between Pete-Rosenheim &\nLarose-Bettina, though it contained the cheese joke, the mother-in-law\njoke, and the joke about the wife rifling her husband's pockets.\n\n\"Our young friend seems to have enviable youthful spirits,\" commented\nMr. Boltwood.\n\n\"Now, no superiority! He's probably never seen a real vaudeville show.\nWouldn't it be fun to take him to the Winter Garden or the Follies for\nthe first time!... Instead of being taken by Jeff Saxton, and having the\nhumor, oh! so articulately explained!\"\n\nThe pictures were resumed; the film which, under ten or twelve different\ntitles, Claire had already seen, even though Brooklyn Heights does not\ndevote Saturday evening to the movies. The badman, the sheriff--an aged\nparty with whiskers and boots--the holdup, the sad eyes of the sheriff's\ndaughter--also an aged party, but with a sunbonnet and the most\nexpensive rouge--the crook's reformation, and his violent adherence to\nlaw and order; this libel upon the portions of these United States lying\nwest of longitude 101\u00c2\u00b0 Claire had seen too often. She dragged her father\nback to the hotel, sent him to bed, and entered her room--to find a\ntelegram upon the bureau.\n\nShe had sent her friends a list of the places at which she would be\nlikely to stop. The message was from Jeff Saxton, in Brooklyn. It\nbrought to her mind the steady shine of his glasses--the most expensive\nglasses, with the very best curved lenses--as it demanded:\n\n    \"Received letter about trip surprised anxious will tire you out\n    fatigue prairie roads bad for your father mountain roads dangerous\n    strongly advise go only part way then take train.       GEOFFREY.\"\n\nShe held the telegram, flipping her fingers against one end of it as she\ndebated. She remembered how the wide world had flowed toward her over\nthe hood of the Gomez all day. She wrote in answer:\n\n    \"Awful perils of road, two punctures, split infinitive, eggs at\n    lunch questionable, but struggle on.\"\n\nBefore she sent it she held council with her father. She sat on the foot\nof his bed and tried to sound dutiful. \"I don't want to do anything\nthat's bad for you, daddy. But isn't it taking your mind away from\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"Ye-es, I think it is. Anyway, we'll try it a few days more.\"\n\n\"I fancy we can stand up under the strain and perils. I think we can\npersuade some of these big farmers to come to the rescue if we encounter\nany walruses or crocodiles among the wheat. And I have a feeling that if\nwe ever get stuck, our friend of the Teal bug will help us.\"\n\n\"Probably never see him again. He'll skip on ahead of us.\"\n\n\"Of course. We haven't laid an eye on him, along the road. He must have\ngotten into Fargo long before we did. Now tomorrow I think----\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE GREAT AMERICAN FRYING PAN\n\n\nIt was Claire's first bad day since the hole in the mud. She had started\ngallantly, scooting along the level road that flies straight west of\nFargo. But at noon she encountered a restaurant which made eating seem\nan evil.\n\nThat they might have fair fame among motorists the commercial club of\nReaper had set at the edge of town a sign \"Welcome to Reaper, a Live\nTown--Speed Limit 8 Miles perhr.\" Being interpreted, that sign meant\nthat if you went much over twenty miles an hour on the main street,\npeople might glance at you; and that the real welcome, the only\nimpression of Reaper that tourists were likely to carry away, was the\nwelcome in the one restaurant. It was called the Eats Garden. As Claire\nand her father entered, they were stifled by a belch of smoke from the\nfrying pan in the kitchen. The room was blocked by a huge lunch counter;\nthere was only one table, covered with oil cloth decorated with\nvenerable spots of dried egg yolk.\n\nThe waiter-cook, whose apron was gravy-patterned, with a border and\nstomacher of plain gray dirt, grumbled, \"Whadyuhwant?\"\n\nClaire sufficiently recovered to pick out the type from the fly specks\non the menu, and she ordered a small steak and coffee for her father;\nfor herself tea, boiled eggs, toast.\n\n\"Toast? We ain't got any toast!\"\n\n\"Well, can't you make it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose I could----\"\n\nWhen they came, the slices of toast were an inch thick, burnt on one\nside and raw on the other. The tea was bitter and the eggs watery. Her\nfather reported that his steak was high-test rawhide, and his\ncoffee--well, he wasn't sure just what substitute had been used for\nchicory, but he thought it was lukewarm quinine.\n\nClaire raged: \"You know, this town really has aspirations. They're\nbeginning to build such nice little bungalows, and there's a fine clean\nbank---- Then they permit this scoundrel to advertise the town among\nstrangers, influential strangers, in motors, by serving food like this!\nI suppose they think that they arrest criminals here, yet this\nrestaurant man is a thief, to charge real money for food like this----\nYes, and he's a murderer!\"\n\n\"Oh, come now, dolly!\"\n\n\"Yes he is, literally. He must in his glorious career have given chronic\nindigestion to thousands of people--shortened their lives by years.\nThat's wholesale murder. If I were the authorities here, I'd be\nindulgent to the people who only murder one or two people, but imprison\nthis cook for life. Really! I mean it!\"\n\n\"Well, he probably does the best he----\"\n\n\"He does not! These eggs and this bread were perfectly good, before he\ndid black magic over them. And did you see the contemptuous look he gave\nme when I was so eccentric as to order toast? Oh, Reaper, Reaper, you\ndesire a modern town, yet I wonder if you know how many thousands of\ntourists go from coast to coast, cursing you? If I could only hang that\nrestaurant man--and the others like him--in a rope of his own hempen\ngriddle cakes! The Great American Frying Pan! I don't expect men\nbuilding a new town to have time to read Hugh Walpole and James Branch\nCabell, but I do expect them to afford a cook who can fry eggs!\"\n\nAs she paid the check, Claire tried to think of some protest which would\nhave any effect on the obese wits of the restaurant man. In face of his\npink puffiness she gave it up. Her failure as a Citizeness Fixit sent\nher out of the place in a fury, carried her on in a dusty whirl till the\nengine spat, sounded tired and reflective, and said it guessed it\nwouldn't go any farther that day.\n\nNow that she had something to do, Claire became patient. \"Run out of\ngas. Isn't it lucky I got that can for an extra gallon?\"\n\nBut there was plenty of gas. There was no discernible reason why the\ncar should not go. She started the engine. It ran for half a minute and\nquit. All the plugs showed sparks. No wires were detached in the\ndistributor. There was plenty of water, and the oil was not clogged. And\nthat ended Claire's knowledge of the inside of a motor.\n\nShe stopped two motorists. The first was sure that there was dirt on the\npoint of the needle valve, in the carburetor. While Claire shuddered\nlest he never get it back, he took out the needle valve, wiped it, put\nit back--and the engine was again started, and again, with great\npromptness, it stopped.\n\nThe second Good Samaritan knew that one of the wires in the distributor\nmust be detached and, though she assured him that she had inspected\nthem, he looked pityingly at her smart sports-suit, said, \"Well, I'll\njust take a look,\" and removed the distributor cover. He also scratched\nhis head, felt of the fuses under the cowl, scratched his cheek, poked a\nfinger at the carburetor, rubbed his ear, said, \"Well, uh----\" looked to\nsee if there was water and gas, sighed, \"Can't just seem to find out\nwhat's the trouble,\" shot at his own car, and escaped.\n\nClaire had been highly grateful and laudatory to both of them--but she\nremained here, ten miles from nowhere. It was a beautiful place. Down a\nhill the wheat swam toward a village whose elevator was a glistening\ntower. Mud-hens gabbled in a slew, alfalfa shone with unearthly green,\nand bees went junketing toward a field of red clover. But she had the\nmotorist's fever to go on. The road behind and in front was very long,\nvery white--and very empty.\n\nHer father, out of much thought and a solid ignorance about all of\nmotoring beyond the hiring of chauffeurs and the payment of bills,\nsuggested, \"Uh, dolly, have you looked to see if these, uh---- Is the\ncarburetor all right?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear; I've looked at it three times, so far,\" she said, just a\nlittle too smoothly.\n\nOn the hill five miles to eastward, a line of dust, then a small car. As\nit approached, the driver must have sighted her and increased speed. He\ncame up at thirty-five miles an hour.\n\n\"Now we'll get something done! Look! It's a bug--a flivver or a Teal or\nsomething. I believe it's the young man that got us out of the mud.\"\n\nMilt Daggett stopped, casually greeted them: \"Why, hello, Miss Boltwood.\nThought you'd be way ahead of me some place!\"\n\n\"Mrwr,\" said Vere de Vere. What this meant the historian does not know.\n\n\"No; I've been taking it easy. Mr., Uh--I can't quite remember your\nname----\"\n\n\"Milt Daggett.\"\n\n\"There's something mysterious the matter with my car. The engine will\nstart, after it's left alone a while, but then it stalls. Do you\nsuppose you could tell what it is?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I'll see if I can find out.\"\n\n\"Then you probably will. The other two men knew everything. One of them\nwas the inventor of wheels, and the other discovered skidding. So of\ncourse they couldn't help me.\"\n\nMilt added nothing to her frivolity, but his smile was friendly. He\nlifted the round rubber cap of the distributor. Then Claire's faith\ntumbled in the dust. Twice had the wires been tested. Milt tested them\nagain. She was too tired of botching to tell him he was wasting time.\n\n\"Got an oil can?\" he hesitated.\n\nThrough a tiny hole in the plate of the distributor he dripped two drops\nof oil--only two drops. \"I guess maybe that's what it needed. You might\ntry her now, and see how she runs,\" he said mildly.\n\nDubiously Claire started the engine. It sang jubilantly, and it did not\nstop. Again was the road open to her. Again was the settlement over\nthere, to which it would have taken her an hour to walk, only six\nminutes away.\n\nShe stopped the engine, beamed at him--there in the dust, on the quiet\nhilltop. He said as apologetically as though he had been at fault,\n\"Distributor got dry. Might give it a little oil about once in six\nmonths.\"\n\n\"We are so grateful to you! Twice now you've saved our lives.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess you'd have gone on living! And if drivers can't help each\nother, who can?\"\n\n\"That's a good start toward world-fellowship, I suppose. I wish we could\ndo---- Return your lunch or---- Mr. Daggett! Do you read books? I\nmean----\"\n\n\"Yes I do, when I run across them.\"\n\n\"Mayn't I gi--lend you these two that I happen to have along? I've\nfinished them, and so has father, I think.\"\n\nFrom the folds of the strapped-down top she pulled out Compton\nMackenzie's _Youth's Encounter_, and Vachel Lindsay's _Congo_. With a\ncurious faint excitement she watched him turn the leaves. His blunt\nfingers flapped through them as though he was used to books. As he\nlooked at _Congo_, he exclaimed, \"Poetry! That's fine! Like it, but I\ndon't hardly ever run across it. I---- Say---- I'm terribly obliged!\"\n\nHis clear face lifted, sun-brown and young and adoring. She had not\noften seen men look at her thus. Certainly Jeff Saxton's painless\nworship did not turn him into the likeness of a knight among banners.\nYet the good Geoffrey loved her, while to Milt Daggett she could be\nnothing more than a strange young woman in a car with a New York\nlicense. If her tiny gift could so please him, how poor he must be. \"He\nprobably lives on some barren farm,\" she thought, \"or he's a penniless\nmechanic hoping for a good job in Seattle. How white his forehead is!\"\n\nBut aloud she was saying, \"I hope you're enjoying your trip.\"\n\n\"Oh yes. I like it fine. You having a good time? Well---- Well, thanks\nfor the books.\"\n\nShe was off before him. Presently she exclaimed to Mr. Boltwood: \"You\nknow--just occurs to me--it's rather curious that our young friend\nshould be so coincidental as to come along just when we needed him.\"\n\n\"Oh, he just happened to, I suppose,\" hemmed her father.\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" she meditated, while she absently watched another\nmember of the Poultry Suicide Club rush out of a safe ditch, prepare to\ntake leave for immortality, change her fowlish mind, flutter up over the\nhood of the car, and come down squawking her indignities to the\nbarnyard. \"I'm not so sure about his happening---- No. I wonder if he\ncould possibly---- Oh no. I hope not. Flattering, but---- You don't\nsuppose he could be deliberately following us?\"\n\n\"Nonsense! He's a perfectly decent young chap.\"\n\n\"I know. Of course. He probably works hard in a garage, and is terribly\nnice to his mother and sisters at home. I mean---- I wouldn't want the\ndear lamb to be a devoted knight, though. Too thankless a job.\"\n\nShe slowed the car down to fifteen an hour. For the first time she began\nto watch the road behind her. In a few minutes a moving spot showed in\nthe dust three miles back. Oh, naturally; he would still be behind her.\nOnly---- If she stopped, just to look at the scenery, he would go on\nahead of her. She stopped for a moment--for a time too brief to indicate\nthat anything had gone wrong with her car. Staring back she saw that the\nbug stopped also, and she fancied that Milt was out standing beside it,\npeering with his palm over his eyes--a spy, unnatural and disturbing in\nthe wide peace.\n\nShe drove on a mile and halted again; again halted her attendant. He was\nkeeping a consistent two to four miles behind, she estimated.\n\n\"This won't do at all,\" she worried. \"Flattering, but somehow----\nWhatever sort of a cocoon-wrapped hussy I am, I don't collect scalps. I\nwon't have young men serving me--graft on them--get amusement out of\ntheir struggles. Besides--suppose he became just a little more friendly,\neach time he came up, all the way from here to Seattle?... Fresh.... No,\nit won't do.\"\n\nShe ran the car to the side of the road.\n\n\"More trouble?\" groaned her father.\n\n\"No. Just want to see scenery.\"\n\n\"But---- There's a good deal of scenery on all sides, without stopping,\nseems to me!\"\n\n\"Yes, but----\" She looked back. Milt had come into sight; had paused to\ntake observations. Her father caught it:\n\n\"Oh, I see. Pardon me. Our squire still following? Let him go on ahead?\nWise lass.\"\n\n\"Yes. I think perhaps it's better to avoid complications.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Mr. Boltwood's manner did not merely avoid Milt; it\nabolished him.\n\nShe saw Milt, after five minutes of stationary watching, start forward.\nHe came dustily rattling up with a hail of \"Distributor on strike\nagain?\" so cheerful that it hurt her to dismiss him. But she had managed\na household. She was able to say suavely:\n\n\"No, everything is fine. I'm sure it will be, now. I'm afraid we are\nholding you back. You mustn't worry about us.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" breezily. \"Something might go wrong. Say, is\nthis poetry book----\"\n\n\"No, I'm sure nothing will go wrong now. You mustn't feel responsible\nfor us. But, uh, you understand we're very grateful for what you have\ndone and, uh, perhaps we shall see each other in Seattle?\" She made it\nbrightly interrogatory.\n\n\"Oh, I see.\" His hands gripped the wheel. His cheeks had been too\nruddily tinted by the Dakota sun to show a blush, but his teeth caught\nhis lower lip. He had no starter on his bug; he had in his embarrassment\nto get out and crank. He did it quietly, not looking at her. She could\nsee that his hand trembled on the crank. When he did glance at her, as\nhe drove off, it was apologetically, miserably. His foot was shaking on\nthe clutch pedal.\n\nThe dust behind his car concealed him. For twenty miles she was silent,\nsave when she burst out to her father, \"I do hope you're enjoying the\ntrip. It's so easy to make people unhappy. I wonder---- No. Had to be\ndone.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE DISCOVERY OF CANNED SHRIMPS AND HESPERIDES\n\n\nOn the morning when Milt Daggett had awakened to sunshine in the woods\nnorth of Gopher Prairie, he had discovered the golden age. As mile on\nmile he jogged over new hills, without having to worry about getting\nback to his garage in time to repair somebody's car, he realized that\nfor the past two years he had forced himself to find contentment in\nbuilding up a business that had no future.\n\nNow he laughed and whooped; he drove with one foot inelegantly and\nenchantingly up on the edge of the cowl; he made Lady Vere de Vere bow\nto astounded farmers; he went to the movies every evening--twice, in\nFargo; and when the chariot of the young prince swept to the brow of a\nhill, he murmured, not in the manner of a bug-driver but with a stinging\nawe, \"All that big country! Ours to see, puss! We'll settle down some\nday and be solid citizens and raise families and wheeze when we walk,\nbut---- All those hills to sail over and---- Come on! Lez sail!\"\n\nMilt attended the motion pictures every evening, and he saw them in a\nnew way. As recently as one week before he had preferred those earnest\ndepictions in which hard-working, moral actors shoot one another, or\nride the most uncomfortable horses up mountainsides. But now, with a\nmental apology to that propagandist of lowbrowism, the absent Mac, he\nchose the films in which the leading men wore evening clothes, and no\none ever did anything without being assisted by a \"man.\" Aside from the\npictures Milt's best tutors were traveling men. Though he measured every\ncent, and for his campfire dinners bought modest chuck steaks, he had at\nleast one meal a day at a hotel, to watch the traveling men.\n\nTo Claire, traveling men were merely commercial persons in hard-boiled\nsuits. She identified them with the writing-up of order-slips on long\nlittered writing-tables, and with hotels that reduced the delicate arts\nof dining and sleeping to gray greasiness. But Milt knew traveling men.\nHe knew that not only were they the missionaries of business,\nsupplementing the taking of orders by telling merchants how to build up\ntrade, how to trim windows and treat customers like human beings; but\nalso that they, as much as the local ministers and doctors and teachers\nand newspapermen, were the agents in spreading knowledge and justice. It\nwas they who showed the young men how to have their hair cut--and to\nwash behind the ears and shave daily; they who encouraged villagers to\nrise from scandal and gossip to a perception of the Great World, of\npolitics and sports, and some measure of art and science.\n\nClaire, and indeed her father and Mr. Jeff Saxton as well, had vaguely\nconcluded that because drummers were always to be seen in soggy hotels\nand badly connecting trains and the headachy waiting-rooms of stations,\nthey must like these places. Milt knew that the drummers were martyrs;\nthat for months of a trip, all the while thinking of the children back\nhome, they suffered from landlords and train schedules; that they were\nClaire's best allies in fighting the Great American Frying Pan; that\nthey knew good things, and fought against the laziness and impositions\nof people who \"kept hotel\" because they had failed as farmers; and that\nwhen they did find a landlord who was cordial and efficient, they went\nforth mightily advertising that glorious man. The traveling men, he\nknew, were pioneers in spats.\n\nHence it was to the traveling men, not to supercilious tourists in\nlimousines, that Milt turned for suggestions as to how to perform the\nmiracle of changing from an ambitious boy into what Claire would\nrecognize as a charming man. He had not met enough traveling men at\nSchoenstrom. They scooped up what little business there was, and escaped\nfrom the Leipzig House to spend the night at St. Cloud or Sauk Centre.\n\nIn the larger towns in Minnesota and Dakota, after evening movies,\nbefore slipping out to his roadside camp Milt inserted himself into a\ncircle of traveling men in large leather chairs, and ventured, \"Saw a\nGomez-Dep with a New York license down the line today.\"\n\n\"Oh. You driving through?\"\n\n\"Yes. Going to Seattle.\"\n\nThat distinguished Milt from the ordinary young-men-loafers, and he was\nadmitted as one of the assembly of men who traveled and saw things and\nwondered about the ways of men. It was good talk he heard; too much of\nhotels, and too many tight banal little phrases suggesting the solution\nof all economic complexities by hanging \"agitators,\" but with this, an\nexciting accumulation of impressions of Vancouver and San Diego, Florida\nand K. C.\n\n\"That's a wonderful work farm they have at Duluth,\" said one, and the\nnext, \"speaking of that, I was in Chicago last week, and I saw a\nplay----\"\n\nMilt had, in his two years of high school in St. Cloud, and in his\nboyhood under the genial but abstracted eye of the Old Doctor, learned\nthat it was not well thought of to use the knife as a hod and to plaster\nmashed potatoes upon it, as was the custom in Mac's Old Home Lunch at\nSchoenstrom. But the arts of courteously approaching oysters, salad, and\npeas were rather unfamiliar to him. Now he studied forks as he had once\nstudied carburetors, and he gave spiritual devotion to the nice eating\nof a canned-shrimp cocktail--a lost legion of shrimps, now two thousand\nmiles and two years away from their ocean home.\n\nHe peeped with equal earnestness at the socks and the shirts of the\ntraveling men. Socks had been to him not an article of faith but a\ndetail of economy. His attitude to socks had lacked in reverence and\ntechnique. He had not perceived that socks may be as sound a symbol of\nculture as the 'cello or even demountable rims. He had been able to\nthink with respect of ties and damp piqu\u00c3\u00a9 collars secured by gold\nsafety-pins; and to the belted fawn overcoat that the St. Klopstock\nbanker's son had brought back from St. Paul, he had given jealous\nattention. But now he graduated into differential socks.\n\nBy his campfire, sighing to the rather somnolent Vere de Vere, he\nscornfully yanked his extra pairs of thick, white-streaked, yellow\ncotton socks from the wicker suitcase, and uttered anathema:\n\n\"Begone, ye unworthy and punk-looking raiment. I know ye! Ye werst a\nbargain and two pairs for two bits. But even as Adolph Zolzac and an\nagent for flivver accessories are ye become in my eyes, ye generation of\nvipers, ye clumsy, bag-footed, wrinkle-sided gunny-sacking ye!\"\n\nNext day, in the woods, a happy hobo found that the manna-bringing\nravens had left him four pairs of good socks.\n\nFive quite expensive pairs of silk and lisle socks Milt purchased--all\nthat the general merchant at Jeppe had in stock. What they lost in\nsuitability to touring and to private laundering at creeks, they gained\nas symbols. Milt felt less shut out from the life of leisure. Now, in\nSeattle, say, he could go into a good hotel with less fear of the\nclerks.\n\nHe added attractive outing shirts, ties neither too blackly dull nor too\nflashily crimson, and a vicious nail-brush which simply tore out the\nmotor grease that had grown into the lines of his hands. Also he added a\nbook.\n\nThe book was a rhetoric. Milt knew perfectly that there was an\nimpertinence called grammar, but it had never annoyed him much. He knew\nthat many persons preferred \"They were\" to \"They was,\" and were nervous\nin the presence of \"ain't.\" One teacher in St. Cloud had buzzed\nfrightfully about these minuti\u00c3\u00a6. But Milt discovered that grammar was\nonly the beginning of woes. He learned that there were such mental\nmortgages as figures of speech and the choice of synonyms. He had always\nknown, but he had never passionately felt that the invariable use of\n\"hell,\" \"doggone,\" and \"You bet!\" left certain subtleties unexpressed.\nNow he was finding subtleties which he had to express.\n\nAs joyously adventurous as going on day after day was his\nexperimentation in voicing his new observations. He gave far more\neagerness to it than Claire Boltwood had. Gustily intoning to Vere de\nVere, who was the perfect audience, inasmuch as she never had anything\nto say but \"Mrwr,\" and didn't mind being interrupted in that, he\nclamored, \"The prairies are the sea. In the distance they are kind of\nsilvery--no--they are dim silver; and way off on the skyline are the\nIslands of the--of the---- Now what the devil was them, were those,\nislands in the mythology book in high school? Of the--Blessed? Great\nsnakes' boots, you're an ignorant cat, Vere! Hesperyds? No! Hesperides!\nYea, bo'! Now that man in the hotel: 'May I trouble you for the train\nguide? Thanks so much!' But how much is so much?\"\n\nAs Claire's days were set free by her consciousness of sun and brown\nearth, so Milt's odyssey was only the more valorous in his endeavor to\ncriticize life. He saw that Mac's lunch room had not been an altogether\nsatisfactory home; that Mac's habit of saying to dissatisfied customers,\n\"If you don't like it, get out,\" had lacked something of courtesy.\nStaring at towns along the way, Milt saw that houses were not merely\nlarge and comfortable, or small and stingy; but that there was an\ninteresting thing he remembered hearing his teachers call \"good taste.\"\n\nHe was not the preoccupied Milt of the garage but a gay-eyed gallant,\nthe evening when he gave a lift to the school-teacher and drove her from\nthe district school among the wild roses and the corn to her home in the\nnext town. She was a neat, tripping, trim-sided school-teacher of\nnineteen or twenty.\n\n\"You're going out to Seattle? My! That's a wonderful trip. Don't you get\ntired?\" she adored.\n\n\"Oh, no. And I'm seeing things. I used to think everything worth while\nwas right near my own town.\"\n\n\"You're so wise to go places. Most of the boys I know don't think there\nis any world beyond Jimtown and Fargo.\"\n\nShe glowed at him. Milt was saying to himself, \"Am I a fool? I probably\ncould make this girl fall in love with me. And she's better than I am;\nso darn neat and clean and gentle. We'd be happy. She's a nice comfy\nfire, and here I go like a boob, chasing after a lone, cold star like\nMiss Boltwood, and probably I'll fall into all the slews from hell to\nbreakfast on the way. But---- I'd get sleepy by a comfy fire.\"\n\n\"Are you thinking hard? You're frowning so,\" ventured the\nschool-teacher.\n\n\"Didn't mean to. 'Scuse!\" he laughed. One hand off the steering wheel,\nhe took her hand--a fresh, cool, virginal hand, snuggling into his,\nsuddenly stirring him. He wanted to hold it tighter. The lamenting\nhistorian of love's pilgrimage must set down the fact that the pilgrim\nfor at least a second forgot the divine tread of the goddess Claire, and\nmade rapid calculation that he could, in a pinch, drive from Schoenstrom\nto the teacher's town in two days and a night; that therefore courtship,\nand this sweet white hand resting in his, were not impossible. Milt\nhimself did not know what it was that made him lay down the hand and\nsay, so softly that he was but half audible through the rattle of the\nengine:\n\n\"Isn't this a slick, mean to say glorious evening? Sky rose and then\nthat funny lavender. And that new moon---- Makes me think of--the girl\nI'm in love with.\"\n\n\"You're engaged?\" wistfully.\n\n\"Not exactly but---- Say, did you study rhetoric in Normal School? I\nhave a rhetoric that's got all kind of poetic extracts, you know, and\nquotations and everything, from the big writers, Stevenson and all.\nAlways been so practical, making a garage pay, never thought much about\nhow I said things as long as I could say 'No!' and say it quick. 'Cept\nmaybe when I was talking to the prof there. But it's great sport to see\nhow musical you can make a thing sound. Words. Like Shenandoah. Gol-lee!\nIsn't that a wonderful word? Makes you see old white mansion, and\nmocking birds---- Wonder if a fellow could be a big engineer, you know,\nbuild bridges and so on, and still talk about, oh, beautiful things?\nWhat d' you think, girlie?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure you could!\"\n\nHer admiration, the proximity of her fragrant slightness, was pleasant\nin the dusk, but he did not press her hand again, even when she\nwhispered, \"Good night, and thank you--oh, thank you.\"\n\nIf Milt had been driving at the rate at which he usually made his\nskipjack carom over the roads about Schoenstrom, he would by now have\nbeen through Dakota, into Montana. But he was deliberately holding down\nthe speed. When he had been tempted by a smooth stretch to go too\nbreathlessly, he halted, teased Vere de Vere, climbed out and, sitting\non a hilltop, his hands about his knees, drenched his soul with the\nvision of amber distances.\n\nHe tried so to time his progress that he might always be from three to\nfive miles behind Claire--distant enough to be unnoticed, near enough to\nhelp in case of need. For behind poetic expression and the use of forks\nwas the fact that his purpose in life was to know Claire.\n\nWhen he was caught, when Claire informed him that he \"mustn't worry\nabout her\"; when, slowly, he understood that she wasn't being neighborly\nand interested in his making time, he wanted to escape, never to see her\nagain.\n\nFor thirty miles his cheeks were fiery. He, most considerate of roadmen,\ncrowded a woman in a flivver, passed a laboring car on an upgrade with\nsuch a burst that the uneasy driver bumped off into a ditch. He hadn't\nreally seen them. Only mechanically had he got past them. He was\nmuttering:\n\n\"She thought I was trying to butt in! Stung again! Like a small boy in\nlove with teacher. And I thought I was so wise! Cussed out Mac--blamed\nMac--no, damn all the fine words--cussed out Mac for being the village\nrumhound. Boozing is twice as sensible as me. See a girl, nice\ndress--start for Seattle! Two thousand miles away! Of course she bawled\nme out. She was dead right. Boob! Yahoo! Goat!\"\n\nHe caught up Vere de Vere, rubbed her fur against his cheek while he\nmourned, \"Oh, puss, you got to be nice to me. I thought I'd do big\nthings. And then the alarm clock went off. I'm back in Schoenstrom. For\nkeeps, I guess. I didn't know I had feelings that could get hurt like\nthis. Thought I had a rhinoceros hide. But---- Oh, it isn't just feeling\nashamed over being a fool. It's that---- Won't ever see her again. Not\nonce. Way I saw her through the window, at that hotel, in that blue\nsilky dress--that funny long line of buttons, and her throat. Never have\ndinner--lunch--with her by the road----\"\n\nIn the reaction of anger he demanded of Vere de Vere, \"What the deuce do\nI care? If she's chump enough to chase away a crack garage man that's\ngone batty and wants to work for nothing, let her go on and hit some\ncrook garage and get stuck for an entire overhauling. What do I care?\nHad nice trip; that's all I wanted. Never did intend to go clear to\nSeattle, anyway. Go on to Butte, then back home. No more fussing about\nfool table-manners and books, and I certainly will cut out tagging\nbehind her! No, sir! Nev-er again!\"\n\nIt was somewhat inconsistent to add, \"There's a bully place--sneak in\nand let her get past me again. But she won't catch me following next\ntime!\"\n\nWhile he tried to keep up his virtuous anger, he was steering into an\nabandoned farmyard, parking the car behind cottonwoods and neglected\ntall currant bushes which would conceal it from the road.\n\nThe windows of the deserted house stared at him; a splintered screen\ndoor banged in every breeze. Lichens leered from the cracks of the\nporch. The yard was filled with a litter of cottonwood twigs, and over\nthe flower garden hulked ragged weeds. In the rank grass about the slimy\ngreen lip of the well, crickets piped derisively. The barn-door was\nopen. Stray kernels of wheat had sprouted between the spokes of a rusty\nbinder-wheel. A rat slipped across the edge of the shattered manger. As\ndusk came on, gray things seemed to slither past the upper windows of\nthe house, and somewhere, under the roof, there was a moaning. Milt was\nsure that it was the wind in a knothole. He told himself that he was\nabsolutely sure about it. And every time it came he stroked Vere de Vere\ncarefully, and once, when the moaning ended in the slamming of the\nscreen door, he said, \"Jiminy!\"\n\nThis boy of the unghostly cylinders and tangible magnetos had never\nseen a haunted house. To toil of the harvest field and machine shop and\nto trudging the sun-beaten road he was accustomed, but he had never\ncrouched watching the slinking spirits of old hopes and broken\naspirations; feeble phantoms of the first eager bridegroom who had come\nto this place, and the mortgage-crushed, rust-wheat-ruined man who had\nleft it. He wanted to leap into the bug and go on. Yet the haunt of\nmurmurous memories dignified his unhappiness. In the soft, tree-dimmed\ndooryard among dry, blazing plains it seemed indecent to go on growling\n\"Gee,\" and \"Can you beat it?\" It was a young poet, a poet rhymeless and\ninarticulate, who huddled behind the shield of untrimmed currant bushes,\nand thought of the girl he would never see again.\n\nHe was hungry, but he did not eat. He was cramped, but he did not move.\nHe picked up the books she had given him. He was quickened by the\npowdery beauty of _Youth's Encounter_; by the vision of laughter and\ndancing steps beneath a streaky gas-glow in the London fog; of youth not\n\"roughhousing\" and wanting to \"be a sport,\" yet in frail beauty and\nfaded crimson banners finding such exaltation as Schoenstrom had never\nknown. But every page suggested Claire, and he tucked the book away.\n\nIn Vachel Lindsay's _Congo_, in a poem called \"The Santa Fe Trail,\" he\nfound his own modern pilgrimage from another point of view. Here was\nthe poet, disturbed by the honking hustle of passing cars. But Milt\nbelonged to the honking and the hustle, and it was not the soul of the\ngrass that he read in the poem, but his own sun-flickering flight:\n\n    Swiftly the brazen car comes on.\n    It burns in the East as the sunrise burns.\n    I see great flashes where the far trail turns.\n    Butting through the delicate mists of the morning,\n    It comes like lightning, goes past roaring,\n    It will hail all the windmills, taunting, ringing,\n    On through the ranges the prairie-dog tills--\n    Scooting past the cattle on the thousand hills.\n    Ho for the tear-horn, scare-horn, dare-horn,\n    Ho for the gay-horn, bark-horn, bay-horn.\n\nMilt did not reflect that if the poet had watched the Teal bug go by, he\nwould not have recorded a scare-horn, a dare-horn, or anything mightier\nthan a yip-horn. Milt saw himself a cross-continent racer, with the\nenvious poet, left behind as a dot on the hill, celebrating his passing.\n\n\"Lord!\" he cried. \"I didn't know there were books like these! Thought\npoetry was all like Longfellow and Byron. Old boys. Europe. And rhymed\nbellyachin' about hard luck. But these books--they're me.\" Very\ncarefully: \"No; they're I! And she gave 'em to me! I will see her again!\nBut she won't know it. Now be sensible, son! What do you expect?\nOh--nothing. I'll just go on, and sneak in one more glimpse of her to\ntake back with me where I belong.\"\n\nHalf an hour after Claire had innocently passed his ambush, he began to\nfollow her. But not for days was he careless. If he saw her on the\nhorizon he paused until she was out of sight. That he might not fail her\nin need, he bought a ridiculously expensive pair of field glasses, and\nwatched her when she stopped by the road. Once, when both her right rear\ntire and the spare were punctured before she could make a town, Milt\nfrom afar saw her patch a tube, pump up the tire in the dust. He ached\nto go to her aid--though it cannot be said that hand-pumping was his\nfavorite July afternoon sport.\n\nLest he encounter her in the streets, he always camped to the eastward\nof the town at which she spent the night. After dusk, when she was\nlikely to end the day's drive in the first sizable place, he hid his bug\nin an alley and, like a spy after the papers, sneaked into each garage\nto see if her car was there.\n\nHe would stroll in, look about vacuously, and pipe to the suspicious\nnight attendant, \"Seen a traveling man named Smith?\" Usually the garage\nman snarled, \"No, I ain't seen nobody named Smith. An'thing else I can\ndo for you?\" But once he was so unlucky as to find the long-missing Mr.\nSmith!\n\nMr. Smith was surprised and insistent. Milt had to do some quick lying.\nDuring that interview the cement floor felt very hard under his\nfidgeting feet, and he thought he heard the garage man in the office\ntelephoning, \"Don't think he knows Smith at all. I got a hunch he's that\nauto thief that was through here last summer.\"\n\nWhen Claire did not stop in the first town she reached after twilight,\nbut drove on by dark, he had to do some perilous galloping to catch up.\nThe lights of a Teal are excellent for adornment, but they have no\nrelation to illumination. They are dependent upon a magneto which is\ndependent only upon faith.\n\nOnce, skittering along by dark, he realized that the halted car which he\nhad just passed was the Gomez. He thought he heard a shout behind him,\nbut in a panic he kept going.\n\nTo the burring motor he groaned, \"Now I probably never will see her\nagain. Except that she thinks I'm such a pest that I dassn't let her\nknow I'm in the same state, I sure am one successful lover. As a Prince\nCharming I win the Vanderbilt Cup. I'm going ahead backwards so fast\nI'll probably drop off into the Atlantic over the next hill!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE MAN WITH AGATE EYES\n\n\nWhen her car had crossed the Missouri River on the swing-ferry between\nBismarck and Mandan, Claire had passed from Middle West to Far West. She\ncame out on an upland of virgin prairie, so treeless and houseless, so\ndivinely dipping, so rough of grass, that she could imagine buffaloes\nstill roving. In a hollow a real prairie schooner was camped, and the\nwandering homestead-seekers were cooking dinner beside it. From a quilt\non the hay in the wagon a baby peeped, and Claire's heart leaped.\n\nBeyond was her first butte, its sharp-cut sides glittering yellow, and\nshe fancied that on it the Sioux scout still sat sentinel, erect on his\npony, the feather bonnet down his back.\n\nNow she seemed to breathe deeper, see farther. Again she came from\nunbroken prairie into wheat country and large towns.\n\nHer impression of the new land was not merely of sun-glaring breadth.\nSometimes, on a cloudy day, the wash of wheatlands was as brown and\nlowering and mysterious as an English moor in the mist. It dwarfed the\nfar-off houses by its giant enchantment; its brooding reaches changed\nher attitude of brisk, gas-driven efficiency into a melancholy that was\nfull of hints of old dark beauty.\n\nEven when the sun came out, and the land was brazenly optimistic, she\nsaw more than just prosperity. In a new home, house and barn and\nwindmill square-cornered and prosaic, plumped down in a field with wheat\ncoming up to the unporticoed door, a habitation unshadowed, unsheltered,\nunsoftened, she found a frank cleanness, as though the inhabitants\nlooked squarely out at life, unafraid. She felt that the keen winds\nought to blow away from such a prairie-fronting post of civilization all\nmildew and cowardice, all the mummy dust of ancient fears.\n\nThese were not peasants, these farmers. Nor, she learned, were they the\n\"hicks\" of humor. She could never again encounter without fiery\nresentment the Broadway peddler's faith that farmers invariably say\n\"Waal, by heck.\" For she had spent an hour talking to one Dakota farmer,\ngenial-eyed, quiet of speech. He had explained the relation of alfalfa\nto soil-chemistry; had spoken of his daughter, who taught economics in a\nstate university; and asked Mr. Boltwood how turbines were hitched up on\nliners.\n\nIn fact, Claire learned that there may be an almost tolerable state of\nexistence without gardenias or the news about the latest Parisian\nimagists.\n\nShe dropped suddenly from the vast, smooth-swelling miles of wheatland\ninto the tortured marvels of the Bad Lands, and the road twisted in the\nshadow of flying buttresses and the terraced tombs of maharajas. While\nshe tried to pick her way through a herd of wild, arroyo-bred cattle,\nshe forgot her maneuvering as she was startled by the stabbing scarlet\nof a column of rock marking the place where for months deep beds of\nlignite had burned.\n\nClaire had often given lifts to tramping harvesters and even hoboes\nalong the road; had enjoyed the sight of their duffle-bags stuck up\nbetween the sleek fenders and the hood, and their talk about people and\ncrops along the road, as they hung on the running-board. In the country\nof long hillslopes and sentinel buttes between the Dakota Bad Lands and\nMiles City she stopped to shout to a man whose plodding heavy back\nlooked fagged, \"Want a ride?\"\n\n\"Sure! You bet!\"\n\nUsually her guests stepped on the right-hand running-board, beside Mr.\nBoltwood, and this man was far over on the right side of the road. But,\nwhile she waited, he sauntered in front of the car, round to her side,\nmounted beside her. Before the car had started, she was sorry to have\ninvited him. He looked her over grinningly, almost contemptuously. His\nunabashed eyes were as bright and hard as agates. Below them, his nose\nwas twisted a little, his mouth bent insolently up at one corner, and\nhis square long chin bristled.\n\nUsually, too, her passengers waited for her to start the conversation,\nand talked at Mr. Boltwood rather than directly to her. But the bristly\nman spat at her as the car started, \"Going far?\"\n\n\"Ye-es, some distance.\"\n\n\"Expensive car?\"\n\n\"Why----\"\n\n\"'Fraid of getting held up?\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought about it.\"\n\n\"Pack a cannon, don't you?\"\n\n\"I don't think I quite understand.\"\n\n\"Cannon! Gun! Revolver! Got a revolver, of course?\"\n\n\"W-why, no.\" She spoke uncomfortably. She was aware that his twinkling\neyes were on her throat. His look made her feel unclean. She tried to\nthink of some question which would lead the conversation to the less\nexclamatory subject of crops. They were on a curving shelf road beside a\nshallow valley. The road was one side of a horseshoe ten miles long. The\nunprotected edge of it dropped sharply to fields forty or fifty feet\nbelow.\n\n\"Prosperous-looking wheat down there,\" she said.\n\n\"No. Not a bit!\" His look seemed to add, \"And you know it--unless you're\na fool!\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't----\"\n\n\"Make Glendive tonight?\"\n\n\"At least that far.\"\n\n\"Say, lady, how's the chance for borrowin' a couple of dollars? I was\nworkin' for a Finnski back here a ways, and he did me dirt--holdin' out\nmy wages on me till the end of the month.\"\n\n\"Why, uh----\"\n\nIt was Claire, not the man, who was embarrassed.\n\nHe was snickering, \"Come on, don't be a tightwad. Swell car--poor man\nwith no eats, not even a two-bits flop for tonight. Could yuh loosen up\nand slip me just a couple bones?\"\n\nMr. Boltwood intervened. He looked as uncomfortable as Claire. \"We'll\nsee. It's rather against my principles to give money to an able-bodied\nman like you, even though it is a pleasure to give you a ride----\"\n\n\"Sure! Don't cost you one red cent!\"\n\n\"--and if I could help you get a job, though of course---- Being a\nstranger out here---- Seems strange to me, though,\" Mr. Boltwood\nstruggled on, \"that a strong fellow like you should be utterly\ndestitute, when I see all these farmers able to have cars----\"\n\nTheir guest instantly abandoned his attitude of supplication for one of\nboasting: \"Destitute? Who the hell said I was destitute, heh?\" He was\nsnarling across Claire at Mr. Boltwood. His wet face was five inches\nfrom hers. She drew her head as far back as she could. She was sure that\nthe man completely appreciated her distaste, for his eyes popped with\namusement before he roared on:\n\n\"I got plenty of money! Just 'cause I'm hoofin' it---- I don't want no\ncharity from nobody! I could buy out half these Honyockers! I don't need\nnone of no man's money!\" He was efficiently working himself into a rage.\n\"Who you calling destitute? All I wanted was an advance till pay day!\nGot a check coming. You high-tone, kid-glove Eastern towerists want to\nwatch out who you go calling destitute. I bet I make a lot more money\nthan a lot of your four-flushin' friends!\"\n\nClaire wondered if she couldn't stop the car now, and tell him to get\noff. But--that snapping eye was too vicious. Before he got off he would\nsay things--scarring, vile things, that would never heal in her brain.\nHer father was murmuring, \"Let's drop him,\" but she softly lied, \"No.\nHis impertinence amuses me.\"\n\nShe drove on, and prayed that he would of himself leave his uncharitable\nhosts at the next town.\n\nThe man was storming--with a very meek ending: \"I'm tellin' you! I can\nmake money anywhere! I'm a crack machinist.... Give me two-bits for a\nmeal, anyway.\"\n\nMr. Boltwood reached in his change pocket. He had no quarter. He pulled\nout a plump bill-fold. Without looking at the man, Claire could vision\nhis eyes glistening and his chops dripping as he stared at the hoard.\nMr. Boltwood handed him a dollar bill. \"There, take that, and let's\nchange the subject,\" said Mr. Boltwood testily.\n\n\"All right, boss. Say, you haven't got a cartwheel instead of this\nwrapping paper, have you? I like to feel my money in my pocket.\"\n\n\"No, sir, I have not!\"\n\n\"All right, boss. No bad feelin's!\"\n\nThen he ignored Mr. Boltwood. His eyes focused on Claire's face. To\nsteady himself on the running-board he had placed his left hand on the\nside of the car, his right on the back of the seat. That right hand slid\nbehind her. She could feel its warmth on her back.\n\nShe burst out, flaring, \"Kindly do not touch me!\"\n\n\"Gee, did I touch you, girlie? Why, that's a shame!\" he drawled, his\ncracked broad lips turning up in a grin.\n\nAn instant later, as they skipped round a bend of the long, high-hung\nshelf road, he pretended to sway dangerously on the running-board, and\ndeliberately laid his filthy hand on her shoulder. Before she could say\nanything he yelped in mock-regret, \"Love o' Mike! 'Scuse me, lady. I\nalmost fell off.\"\n\nQuietly, seriously, Claire said, \"No, that wasn't accidental. If you\ntouch me again, I'll stop the car and ask you to walk.\"\n\n\"Better do it now, dolly!\" snapped Mr. Boltwood.\n\nThe man hooked his left arm about the side-post of the open\nwindow-shield. It was a strong arm, a firm grip. He seized her left\nwrist with his free hand. Though all the while his eyes grotesquely kept\ntheir amused sparkle, and beside them writhed laughter-wrinkles, he\nshouted hoarsely, \"You'll stop hell!\" His hand slid from her wrist to\nthe steering wheel. \"I can drive this boat's well as you can. You make\none move to stop, and I steer her over---- Blooie! Down the bank!\"\n\nHe did twist the front wheels dangerously near to the outer edge of the\nshelf road. Mr. Boltwood gazed at the hand on the wheel. With a quick\nbreath Claire looked at the side of the road. If the car ran off, it\nwould shoot down forty feet ... turning over and over.\n\n\"Y-you wouldn't dare, because you'd g-go, too!\" she panted.\n\n\"Well, dearuh, you just try any monkey business and you'll find out how\nmuch I'll gggggggo-too! I'll start you down the joy-slope and jump off,\nsavvy? Take your foot off that clutch.\"\n\nShe obeyed.\n\n\"Pretty lil feet, ain't they, cutie! Shoes cost about twelve bucks, I\nreckon. While a better man than you or old moldy-face there has to hit\nthe pike in three-dollar brogans. Sit down, yuh fool!\"\n\nThis last to Mr. Boltwood, who had stood up, swaying with the car, and\nstruck at him. With a huge arm the man swept Mr. Boltwood back into the\nseat, but without a word to her father, he continued to Claire:\n\n\"And keep your hand where it belongs. Don't go trying to touch that\nswitch. Aw, be sensible! What would you do if the car did stop? I could\nblackjack you both before this swell-elegant vehickle lost momentum,\nsavvy? I don't want to pay out my good money to a lawyer on a charge\nof--murder. Get me? Better take it easy and not worry.\" His hand was\nconstantly on the wheel. He had driven cars before. He was steering as\nmuch as she. \"When I get you up the road a piece I'm going to drive all\nthe cute lil boys and girls up a side trail, and take all of papa's\ngosh-what-a-wad in the cunnin' potet-book, and I guess we'll kiss lil\ndaughter, and drive on, a-wavin' our hand politely, and let you suckers\nwalk to the next burg.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't dare! You wouldn't dare!\"\n\n\"Dare? Huh! Don't make the driver laugh!\"\n\n\"I'll get help!\"\n\n\"Yep. Sure. Fact, there's a car comin' toward us. 'Bout a mile away I'd\nmake it, wouldn't you? Well, dollface, if you make one peep--over the\nbank you go, both of you dead as a couplin'-pin. Smeared all over those\nrocks. Get me? And me--I'll be sorry the regrettable accident was so\nnaughty and went and happened--and I just got off in time meself. And\nI'll pinch papa's poke while I'm helping get out the bodies!\"\n\nTill now she hadn't believed it. But she dared not glance at the\napproaching car. It was their interesting guest who steered the Gomez\npast the other; and he ran rather too near the edge of the road ... so\nthat she looked over, down.\n\nBeaming, he went on, \"I'd pull the rough stuff right here, instead of\nwastin' my time as a cap'n of industry by taking you up to see the\nscenery in that daisy little gully off the road; but the whole world can\nsee us along here--the hicks in the valley and anybody that happens to\nsneak along in a car behind us. Shame the way this road curves--see too\nfar along it. Fact, you're giving me a lot of trouble. But you'll give\nme a kiss, won't you, Gwendolyn?\"\n\nHe bent down, chuckling. She could feel his bristly chin touch her\ncheek. She sprang up, struck at him. He raised his hand from the wheel.\nFor a second the car ran without control. He jabbed her back into the\nseat with his elbow. \"Don't try any more monkey-shines, if you know\nwhat's good for you,\" he said, quite peacefully, as he resumed steering.\n\nShe was in a haze, conscious only of her father's hand fondling hers.\nShe heard a quick pit-pit-pit-pit behind them. Car going to pass? She'd\nhave to let it go by. She'd concentrate on finding something she\ncould----\n\nThen, \"Hello, folks. Having a picnic? Who's your little friend in the\nrompers?\" sang out a voice beside them. It was Milt Daggett--the Milt\nwho must be scores of miles ahead. His bug had caught up with them, was\nrunning even with them on the broad road.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE HILLSIDE ROAD\n\n\nSo unexpectedly, so genially, that Claire wondered if he realized what\nwas happening, Milt chuckled to the tough on the running-board, as the\ntwo cars ran side by side, \"Bound for some place, brother?\"\n\nThe unwelcome guest looked puzzled. For the first time his china eyes\nceased twinkling; and he answered dubiously: \"Just gettin' a lift.\" He\nsped up the car with the hand-throttle. Milt accelerated equally.\n\nClaire roused; wanted to shout. She was palsied afraid that Milt would\nleave them. The last time she had seen him, she had suggested that\nleaving them would be a favor.\n\nHer guest growled at her--the words coming through a slit at the corner\nof his rowdy mouth, \"Sit still, or I'll run you over.\"\n\nMilt innocently babbled on, \"Better come ride with me, bo'. More room in\nthis-here handsome coupelet.\"\n\nThen was the rough relieved in his uneasy tender little heart, and his\neyes flickered again as he shouted back, not looking at Milt, \"Thanks,\nbub, I'll stick by me friends.\"\n\n\"Oh no; can't lose pleasure of your company. I like your looks. You're a\nbloomin' little island way off on the dim silver skyline.\" Claire\nknitted her brows. She had not seen Milt's rhetoric. \"You're an island\nof Hesperyds or Hesperides. Accent on the bezuzus. Oh, yes, moondream, I\nthink you better come. Haven't decided\"--Milt's tone was bland--\"whether\nto kill you or just have you pinched. Miss Boltwood! Switch off your\npower!\"\n\n\"If she does,\" the tough shouted, \"I'll run 'em off the bank.\"\n\n\"No, you won't, sweetheart, 'cause why? 'Cause what'll I do to you\nafterwards?\"\n\n\"You won't do nothin', Jack, 'cause I'd gouge your eyes out.\"\n\n\"Why, lovesoul, d' you suppose I'd be talking up as brash as this to a\nbid, stwong man like oo if I didn't have a gun handy?\"\n\n\"Yuh, I guess so, lil sunbeam. And before you could shoot, I'd crowd\nyour tin liz into the bank, and jam right into it! I may get killed, but\nyou won't even be a grease-spot!\"\n\nHe was turning the Gomez from its straight course, forcing Milt's bug\ntoward the high bank of earth which walled in the road on the left.\n\nWhile Claire was very sick with fear, then more sick with contempt, Milt\nsquealed, \"You win!\" And he had dropped back. The Gomez was going on\nalone.\n\nThere was only one thing more for Claire--to jump. And that meant death.\n\nThe tough was storming, \"Your friend's a crack shot--with his mouth!\"\n\nThe thin pit-pit-pit was coming again. She looked back. She saw Milt's\nbug snap forward so fast that on a bump its light wheels were in the\nair. She saw Milt standing on the right side of the bug holding the\nwheel with one hand, and the other hand--firm, grim, broad-knuckled\nhand--outstretched toward the tough, then snatching at his collar.\n\nThe tough's grip was torn from the steering wheel. He was yanked from\nthe running-board. He crunched down on the road.\n\nShe seized the wheel. She drove on at sixty miles an hour. She had gone\na good mile before she got control of her fear and halted. She saw Milt\nturn his little car as though it were a prancing bronco. It seemed to\npaw the air with its front wheels. He shot back, pursuing the late\nguest. The man ran bobbing along the road. At this distance he was no\nlonger formidable, but a comic, jerking, rabbity figure, humping himself\nover the back track.\n\nAs the bug whirled down on him, the tough was to be seen throwing up his\nhands, leaping from the high bank.\n\nMilt turned again and came toward them, but slowly; and after he had\ndrawn up even and switched off the engine, he snatched off his violent\nplaid cap and looked apologetic.\n\n\"Sorry I had to kid him along. I was afraid he really would drive you\noff the bank. He was a bad actor. And he was right; he could have licked\nme. Thought maybe I could jolly him into getting off, and have him\npinched, next town.\"\n\n\"But you had a gun--a revolver--didn't you, lad?\" panted Mr. Boltwood.\n\n\"Um, wellllll---- I've got a shotgun. It wouldn't take me more 'n five\nor ten minutes to dig it out, and put it together. And there's some\nshells. They may be all right. Haven't looked at 'em since last fall.\nThey didn't get so awful damp then.\"\n\n\"But suppose he'd had a revolver himself?\" wailed Claire.\n\n\"Gee, you know, I thought he probably did have one. I was scared blue. I\nhad a wrench to throw at him though,\" confided Milt.\n\n\"How did you know we needed you?\"\n\n\"Why back there, couple miles behind you, maybe I saw your father get up\nand try to wrestle him, so I suspected there was kind of a disagreement.\nSay, Miss Boltwood, you know when you spoke to me--way back there--I\nhadn't meant to butt in. Honest. I thought maybe as we were going----\"\n\n\"Oh, I know!\"\n\n\"--the same way, you wouldn't mind my trailing, if I didn't sit in too\noften; and I thought maybe I could help you if----\"\n\n\"Oh, I know! I'm so ashamed! So bitterly ashamed! I just meant---- Will\nyou forgive me? You were so good, taking care of us----\"\n\n\"Oh, sure, that's all right!\"\n\n\"I fancy you do know how grateful father and I are that you were behind\nus, this time! Wasn't it a lucky accident that we'd slipped past you\nsome place!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" dryly, \"quite an accident. Well, I'll skip on ahead again. May\nrun into you again before we hit Seattle. Going to take the run through\nYellowstone Park?\"\n\n\"Yes, but----\" began Claire. Her father interrupted:\n\n\"Uh, Mr., uh--Daggett, was it?--I wonder if you won't stay a little\ncloser to us hereafter? I was getting rather a good change out of the\ntrip, but I'm afraid that now---- If it wouldn't be an insult, I'd beg\nyou to consider staying with us for a consideration, uh, you know,\nremuneration, and you could----\"\n\n\"Thanks, uh, thank you, sir, but I wouldn't like to do it. You see, it's\nkind of my vacation. If I've done anything I'm tickled----\"\n\n\"But perhaps,\" Mr. Boltwood ardently begged the young man recently so\nabysmally unimportant, \"perhaps you would consent to being my guest,\nwhen you cared to--say at hotels in the Park.\"\n\n\"'Fraid I couldn't. I'm kind of a lone wolf.\"\n\n\"Please! Pretty please!\" besought Claire. Her smile was appealing, her\neyes on his.\n\nMilt bit his knuckles. He looked weak. But he persisted, \"No, you'll get\nover this scrap with our friend. By the way, I'll put the deputy onto\nhim, in the next town. He'll never get out of the county. When you\nforget him---- Oh no, you can go on fine. You're a good steady driver,\nand the road's perfectly safe--if you give people the once-over before\nyou pick 'em up. Picking up badmen is no more dangerous here than it\nwould be in New York. Fact, there's lot more hold-ups in any city than\nin the wildest country. I don't think you showed such awfully good taste\nin asking Terrible Tim, the two-gun man, right into the parlor. Gee,\nplease don't do it again! Please!\"\n\n\"No,\" meekly. \"I was an idiot. I'll be good, next time. But won't you\nstay somewhere near us?\"\n\n\"I'd like to, but I got to chase on. Don't want to wear out the welcome\non the doormat, and I'm due in Seattle, and---- Say, Miss Boltwood.\" He\nswung out of the bug, cranked up, climbed back, went awkwardly on, \"I\nread those books you gave me. They're slick--mean to say, interesting.\nWhere that young fellow in _Youth's Encounter_ wanted to be a bishop and\na soldier and everything---- Just like me, except Schoenstrom is\ndifferent, from London, some ways! I always wanted to be a brakie, and\nthen a yeggman. But I wasn't bright enough for either. I just became a\ngarage man. And I---- Some day I'm going to stop using slang. But it'll\ntake an operation!\"\n\nHe was streaking down the road, and Claire was sobbing, \"Oh, the lamb,\nthe darling thing! Fretting about his slang, when he wasn't afraid in\nthat horrible nightmare. If we could just do something for him!\"\n\n\"Don't you worry about him, dolly. He's a very energetic chap. And----\nUh---- Mightn't we drive on a little farther, perhaps? I confess that\nthe thought of our recent guest still in this vicinity----\"\n\n\"Yes, and---- Oh, I'm shameless. If Mohammed Milton won't stay with our\ncar mountain, we're going to tag after him.\"\n\nBut when she reached the next hill, with its far shining outlook, there\nwas no Milt and no Teal bug on the road ahead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nSAGEBRUSH TOURISTS OF THE GREAT HIGHWAY\n\n\nShe had rested for two days in Miles City; had seen the horse-market,\nwith horse-wranglers in chaps; had taken dinner with army people at Fort\nKeogh, once the bulwark against the Sioux, now nodding over the dry\ngrass on its parade ground.\n\nBy the Yellowstone River, past the Crow reservation, Claire had driven\non through the Real West, along the Great Highway. The Red Trail and the\nYellowstone Trail had joined now and she was one of the new Canterbury\nPilgrims. Even Mr. Boltwood caught the trick of looking for licenses,\nand cried, \"There's a Connecticut car!\"\n\nTo the Easterner, a drive from New York to Cape Cod, over asphalt, is\nviewed as heroic, but here were cars that had casually started on\nthousand-mile vacations. She kept pace not only with large cars touring\nfrom St. Louis or Detroit to Glacier Park and Yellowstone, but also she\nfound herself companionable with families of workmen, headed for a new\ntown and a new job, and driving because a flivver, bought second-hand\nand soon to be sold again, was cheaper than trains.\n\n\"Sagebrush Tourists\" these camping adventurers were called. Claire\nbecame used to small cars, with curtain-lights broken, bearing\nwash-boilers or refrigerators on the back, pasteboard suitcases lashed\nby rope to the running-board, frying pans and canvas water bottles\ndangling from top-rods. And once baby's personal laundry was seen\nflapping on a line across a tonneau!\n\nIn each car was what looked like the crowd at a large\nfarm-auction--grandfather, father, mother, a couple of sons and two or\nthree daughters, at least one baby in the arms of each grown-up, all\njammed into two seats already filled with trunks and baby-carriages. And\nthey were happy--incredibly happier than the smart people being conveyed\nin a bored way behind chauffeurs.\n\nThe Sagebrush Tourists made camp; covered the hood with a quilt from\nwhich the cotton was oozing; brought out the wash-boiler, did a washing,\nhad dinner, sang about the fire; granther and the youngest baby\ngamboling together, while the limousinvalids, insulated from life by\nplate glass, preserved by their steady forty an hour from the commonness\nof seeing anything along the road, looked out at the campers for a\nsecond, sniffed, rolled on, wearily wondering whether they would find a\ngood hotel that night--and why the deuce they hadn't come by train.\n\nIf Claire Boltwood had been protected by Jeff Saxton or by a chauffeur,\nshe, too, would probably have marveled at cars gray with dust, the\nunshaved men in fleece-lined duck coats, and the women wind-burnt\nbeneath the boudoir caps they wore as motoring bonnets. But Claire knew\nnow that filling grease-cups does not tend to delicacy of hands; that\nwhen you wash with a cake of petrified pink soap and half a pitcher of\ncold hard water, you never quite get the stain off--you merely get\nthrough the dust stratum to the Laurentian grease formation, and mutter,\n\"a nice clean grease doesn't hurt food,\" and go sleepily down to dinner.\n\nShe saw a dozen camping devices unknown to the East: trailers, which by\nday bobbed along behind the car like coffins on two wheels, but at night\nopened into tents with beds, an ice-box, a table; tents covering a bed\nwhose head rested on the running-board; beds made-up in the car, with\nthe cushions as mattresses.\n\nThe Great Transcontinental Highway was colored not by motors alone. It\nis true that the Old West of the stories is almost gone; that Billings,\nMiles City, Bismarck, are more given to Doric banks than to gambling\nhells. But still are there hints of frontier days. Still trudge the\nprairie schooners; cowpunchers in chaps still stand at the doors of log\ncabins--when they are tired of playing the automatic piano; and blanket\nIndians, Blackfeet and Crows, stare at five-story buildings--when they\nare not driving modern reapers on their farms.\n\nThey all waved to Claire. Telephone linemen, lolling with pipes and\nclimber-strapped legs in big trucks, sang out to her; traction engine\ncrews shouted; and these she found to be her own people. Only once did\nshe lose contentment--when, on the observation platform of a train bound\nfor Seattle, she saw a Britisher in flannels and a monocle, headed\nperhaps for the Orient. As the train slipped silkenly away, the Gomez\nseemed slow and clumsy, and the strain of driving intolerable. And that\nBritisher must be charming---- Then a lonely, tight-haired woman in the\ndoorway of a tar-paper shack waved to her, and in that wistful gesture\nClaire found friendship.\n\nAnd sometimes in the \"desert\" of yet unbroken land she paused by the\nGreat Highway and forgot the passion to keep going----\n\nShe sat on a rock, by a river so muddy that it was like yellow milk. The\nonly trees were a bunch of cottonwoods untidily scattering shreds of\ncotton, and the only other vegetation left in the dead world was\ndusty green sagebrush with lumps of gray yet pregnant earth between,\nor a few exquisite green and white flashes of the herb called\nSnow-on-the-Mountain. The inhabitants were jackrabbits, or American\nmagpies in sharp black and white livery, forever trying to balance their\nhuge tails against the wind, and yelling in low-magpie their opinion of\ntourists.\n\nShe did not desire gardens, then, nor the pettiness of plump terraced\nhills. She was in the Real West, and it was hers, since she had won to\nit by her own plodding. Her soul--if she hadn't had one, it would\nimmediately have been provided, by special arrangement, the moment she\nsat there--sailed with the hawks in the high thin air, and when it came\ndown it sang hallelujahs, because the sagebrush fragrance was more\nhealing than piney woods, because the sharp-bitten edges of the buttes\nwere coral and gold and basalt and turquoise, and because a real person,\none Milt Daggett, though she would never see him again, had found her\nworthy of worship.\n\nShe did not often think of Milt; she did not know whether he was ahead\nof her, or had again dropped behind. When she did recall him, it was\nwith respect quite different from the titillation that dancing men had\nsometimes aroused, or the impression of manicured agreeableness and\nefficiency which Jeff Saxton carried about.\n\nShe always supplicated the mythical Milt in moments of tight driving.\nDriving, just the actual getting on, was her purpose in life, and the\nroutine of driving was her order of the day: Morning freshness, rolling\nup as many miles as possible before lunch, that she might loaf\nafterward. The invariable two P.M. discovery that her eyes ached, and\nthe donning of huge amber glasses, which gave to her lithe smartness a\ncounterfeit scholarliness. Toward night, the quarter-hour of level\nsun-glare which prevented her seeing the road. Dusk, and the discovery\nof how much light there was after all, once she remembered to take off\nher glasses. The worst quarter-hour when, though the roads were an\namethyst rich to the artist, they were also a murkiness exasperating to\nthe driver, yet still too light to be thrown into relief by the lamps.\nThe mystic moment when night clicked tight, and the lamps made a fan of\ngold, and Claire and her father settled down to plodding content--and no\nlonger had to take the trouble of admiring the scenery!\n\nThe morning out of Billings, she wondered why a low cloud so\npersistently held its shape, and realized that it was a far-off\nmountain, her first sight of the Rockies. Then she cried out, and wished\nfor Milt to share her exultation. Rather earnestly she said to Mr.\nBoltwood:\n\n\"The mountains must be so wonderful to Mr. Daggett, after spending his\nlife in a cornfield. Poor Milt! I hope----\"\n\n\"I don't think you need to worry about that young man. I fancy he's\nquite able to run about by himself, as jolly as a sand-dog. And---- Of\ncourse I'm extremely grateful to him for his daily rescue of us from the\njaws of death, but he was right; if he had stayed with us, it would have\nbeen inconvenient to keep considering him. He isn't accustomed to the\ncomedy of manners----\"\n\n\"He ought to be. He'd enjoy it so. He's the real American. He has\nimagination and adaptability. It's a shame: all the _petits fours_ and\nBach recitals wasted on Jeff Saxton, when a Milt Dag----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, quite so!\"\n\n\"No, honest! The dear honey-lamb, so ingenious, and really, rather\ngood-looking. But so lonely and gregarious--like a little woolly dog\nthat begs you to come and play; and I slapped him when he patted his\npaws and gamboled---- It was horrible. I'll never forgive myself. Making\nhim drive on ahead in that nasty, patronizing way---- I feel as if we'd\nspoiled his holiday. I wonder if he had intended to make the Yellowstone\nPark trip? He didn't----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Let's forget the young man. Look! How very curious!\"\n\nThey were crossing a high bridge over a railroad track along which a\ncircus train was bending. Mr. Boltwood offered judicious remarks upon\nthe migratory habits of circuses, and the vision of the Galahad of the\nTeal bug was thoroughly befogged by parental observations, till Claire\nreturned from youthful romance to being a sensible Boltwood, and decided\nthat after all, Milt was not a lord of the sky-painted mountains.\n\nBefore they bent south, at Livingston, Claire had her first mountain\ndriving, and once she had to ford a stream, putting the car at it,\nwatching the water curve up in a lovely silver veil. She felt that she\nwas conquering the hills as she had the prairies.\n\nShe pulled up on a plateau to look at her battery. She noted the edge of\na brake-band peeping beyond the drum, in a ragged line of fabric and\ncopper wire. Then she knew that she didn't know enough to conquer. \"Do\nyou suppose it's dangerous?\" she asked her father, who said a lot of\ncomforting things that didn't mean anything.\n\nShe thought of Milt. She stopped a passing car. The driver \"guessed\"\nthat the brake-band was all gone, and that it would be dangerous to\ncontinue with it along mountain roads. Claire dustily tramped two miles\nto a ranch house, and telephoned to the nearest garage, in a town called\nSaddle Back.\n\nWhenever a motorist has delirium he mutters those lamentable words,\n\"Telephoned to the nearest garage.\"\n\nShe had to wait a tedious hour before she saw a flivver rattling up with\nthe garage man, who wasn't a man at all, but a fourteen-year-old boy. He\nsnorted, \"Rats, you didn't need to send for me. Could have made it\nperfectly safe. Come on.\"\n\nNever has the greatest boy pianist received such awe as Claire gave to\nthis contemptuous young god, with grease on his peachy cheeks. She did\ncome on. But she rather hoped that she was in great danger. It was\nhumiliating to telephone to a garage for nothing. When she came into the\ngas-smelling garage in Saddle Back she said appealingly to the man in\ncharge, a serious, lip-puffing person of forty-five, \"Was it safe to\ncome in with the brake-band like that?\"\n\n\"No. Pretty risky. Wa'n't it, Mike?\"\n\nThe Mike to whom he turned for authority was the same fourteen-year-old\nboy. He snapped, \"Heh? That? Naw! Put in new band. Get busy. Bring me\nthe jack. Hustle up, uncle.\"\n\nWhile the older man stood about and vainly tried to impress people who\ncame in and asked questions which invariably had to be referred to his\nrepair boy, the precocious expert stripped the wheel down to something\nthat looked to Claire distressingly like an empty milk-pan. Then the boy\ndidn't seem to know exactly what to do. He scratched his ear a good\ndeal, and thought deeply. The older man could only scratch.\n\nSo for two hours Claire and her father experienced that most distressing\nof motor experiences--waiting, while the afternoon that would have been\nso good for driving went by them. Every fifteen minutes they came in\nfrom sitting on a dry-goods box in front of the garage, and never did\nthe repair appear to be any farther along. The boy seemed to be giving\nall his time to getting the wrong wrench, and scolding the older man for\nhaving hidden the right one.\n\nWhen she had left Brooklyn Heights, Claire had not expected to have such\nauthoritative knowledge of the Kalifornia Kandy Kitchen, Saddle Back,\nMontana, across from Tubbs' Garage, that she could tell whether they\nwere selling more Atharva Cigarettes or Polutropons. She prowled about\nthe garage till she knew every pool of dripped water in the tin pail of\nsoft soap in the iron sink.\n\nShe was worried by an overheard remark of the boy wonder, \"Gosh, we\nhaven't any more of that decent brake lining. Have to use this piece of\nmush.\" But when the car was actually done, nothing like a dubious brake\ncould have kept her from the glory of starting. The first miles seemed\nmiracles of ease and speed.\n\nShe came through the mountains into Livingston.\n\nKicking his heels on a fence near town, and fondling a gray cat, sat\nMilt Daggett, and he yelped at her with earnestness and much noise.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE WONDERS OF NATURE WITH ALL MODERN IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\"Hello!\" said Milt.\n\n\"Hel-lo!\" said Claire.\n\n\"How dee do,\" said Mr. Boltwood.\n\n\"This is so nice! Where's your car? I hope nothing's happened,\" glowed\nClaire.\n\n\"No. It's back here from the road a piece. Camp there tonight. Reason I\nstopped---- Struck me you've never done any mountain driving, and\nthere's some pretty good climbs in the Park; slick road, but we go up to\nalmost nine thousand feet. And cold mornings. Thought I'd tip you off to\nsome driving tricks--if you'd like me to.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course. Very grateful----\"\n\n\"Then I'll tag after you tomorrow, and speak my piece.\"\n\n\"So jolly you're going through the Park.\"\n\n\"Yes, thought might as well. What the guide books call 'Wonders of\nNature.' Only wonder of nature I ever saw in Schoenstrom was my friend\nMac trying to think he was soused after a case of near-beer. Well----\nSee you tomorrow.\"\n\nNot once had he smiled. His tone had been impersonal. He vaulted the\nfence and tramped away.\n\nWhen they drove out of town, in the morning, they found Milt waiting by\nthe road, and he followed them till noon. By urgent request, he shared a\nlunch, and lectured upon going down long grades in first or second\nspeed, to save brakes; upon the use of the retarded spark and the\nslipped clutch in climbing. His bug was beside the Gomez in the line-up\nat the Park gate, when the United States Army came to seal one's\nfirearms, and to inquire on which mountain one intended to be killed by\ndefective brakes. He was just behind her all the climb up to Mammoth Hot\nSprings.\n\nWhen she paused for water to cool the boiling radiator, the bug panted\nup, and with the first grin she had seen on his face since Dakota Milt\nchuckled, \"The Teal is a grand car for mountains. Aside from\noverheating, bum lights, thin upholstery, faulty ignition, tissue-paper\nbrake-bands, and this-here special aviation engine, specially built for\na bumble-bee, it's what the catalogues call a powerful brute!\"\n\nClaire and her father stayed at the chain of hotels through the Park.\nMilt was always near them, but not at the hotels. He patronized one of\nthe chains of permanent camps.\n\nThe Boltwoods invited him to dinner at one hotel, but he refused and----\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBecause he was afraid that Claire would find him intrusive, Milt was\ngrave in her presence. He couldn't respond either to her enthusiasm\nabout canyon and colored pool--or to her rage about the tourists who,\nshe alleged, preferred freak museum pieces to plain beauty; who never\nadmired a view unless it was labeled by a signpost and megaphoned by a\nguide as something they ought to admire--and tell the Folks Back Home\nabout.\n\nWhen she tried to express this social rage to Milt he merely answered\nuneasily, \"Yes, I guess there's something to that.\"\n\nShe was, he pondered, so darn particular. How could he ever figure out\nwhat he ought to do? No thanks; much obliged, but guessed he'd better\nnot accept her invitation to dinner. Darn sorry couldn't come but----\nHad promised a fellow down at the camp to have chow with him.\n\nIf in this Milt was veracious, he was rather fickle to his newly\ndiscovered friend; for while Claire was finishing dinner, a solemn young\nman was watching her through a window.\n\nShe was at a table for six. She was listening to a man of thirty in\nriding-breeches, a stock, and a pointed nose, who bowed to her every\ntime he spoke, which was so frequently that his dining gave the\nimpression of a man eating grape-fruit on a merry-go-round. Back in\nSchoenstrom, fortified by Mac and the bunch at the Old Home Lunch, Milt\nwould have called the man a \"dude,\" and--though less noisily than the\nothers--would have yelped, \"Get onto Percy's beer-bottle pants. What's\nhe got his neck bandaged for? Bet he's got a boil.\"\n\nBut now Milt yearned, \"He does look swell. Wish I could get away with\nthose things. Wouldn't I look like a fool with my knees buttoned up,\nthough! And there's two other fellows in dress suits. Wouldn't mind\nthose so much. Gee, it must be awful where you've got so many suits of\ntrick clothes you don't know which one to wear.\n\n\"That fellow and Claire are talking pretty swift. He doesn't need any\npiston rings, that lad. Wonder--wonder what they're talking about?\nMusic, I guess, and books and pictures and scenery. He's saying that no\ntongue or pen can describe the glories of the Park, and then he's trying\nto describe 'em. And maybe they know the same folks in New York. Lord,\nhow I'd be out of it. I wish----\"\n\nMilt made a toothpick out of a match, decided that toothpicks were\ninelegant in his tragic mood, and longed: \"Never did see her among her\nown kind of folks till now. I wish I could jabber about music and stuff.\nI'll learn it. I will! I can! I picked up autos in three months. I----\nMilt, you're a dub. I wonder can they be talking French, maybe, or Wop,\nor something? I could get onto the sedan styles in highbrow talk as long\nas it was in American.\n\n\"I could probably spring linen-collar stuff about, 'Really a delightful\nbook, so full of delightful characters,' if I stuck by the rhetoric\nbooks long enough. But once they begin the _parlez-vous, oui, oui_, I'm\na gone goose. Still, by golly, didn't I pick up Dutch--German--like a\nmice? Back off, son! You did not! You can talk Plattdeutsch something\ngrand, as long as you keep the verbs and nouns in American. You got a\nnice character, Milt, but you haven't got any parts of speech.\n\n\"Now look at Percy! Taking a bath in a finger-bowl. I never could pull\nthat finger-bowl stuff; pinning your ears back and jiu-jitsing the fried\nchicken, and then doing a high dive into a little dish that ain't--that\nisn't either a wash-bowl or real good lemonade. He's a perfect lady,\nPercy is. Dabs his mouth with his napkin like a watchmaker tinkering the\ncarburetor in a wrist watch.\n\n\"Lookit him bow and scrape--asking her something---- Rats, he's going\nout in the lobby with her. Walks like a cat on a wet ash-pile. But----\nOh thunder, he's all right. Neat. I never could mingle with that bunch.\nI'd be web-footed and butter-fingered. And he seems to know all that\nbunch--bows to every maiden aunt in the shop. Now if I was following\nher, I'd never see anybody but her; rest of the folks could all bob\ntheir heads silly, and I'd never see one blame thing except that funny\nlittle soft spot at the back of her neck. Nope, you're kind to your\ncat, Milt, but you weren't cut out to be no parlor-organ duet.\"\n\nThis same meditative young man might have been discovered walking past\nthe porch of the hotel, his hands in his pockets, his eyes presumably on\nthe stars--certainly he gave no signs of watching Claire and the man in\nriding-breeches as they leaned over the rail, looked at mountain-tops\nfilmy in starlight, while in the cologne-atomized mode, Breeches quoted:\n\n    Ah, 'tis far heaven my awed heart seeks\n    When I behold those mighty peaks.\n\nMilt could hear him commenting, \"Doesn't that just get the feeling of\nthe great open, Miss Boltwood?\"\n\nMilt did not catch her answer. Himself, he grunted, \"I never could get\nmuch het up about this poetry that's full of Ah's and 'tises.\"\n\nClaire must have seen Milt just after he had sauntered past. She cried,\n\"Oh, Mr. Daggett! Just a moment!\" She left Breeches, ran down to Milt.\nHe was frightened. Was he going to get what he deserved for\neavesdropping?\n\nShe was almost whispering. \"Save me from our friend up on the porch,\"\nshe implored.\n\nHe couldn't believe it. But he took a chance. \"Won't you have a little\nwalk?\" he roared.\n\n\"So nice of you--just a little way, perhaps?\" she sang out.\n\nThey were silent till he got up the nerve to admire, \"Glad you found\nsome people you knew in the hotel.\"\n\n\"But I didn't.\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought your friend in the riding-pants was chummy.\"\n\n\"So did I!\" She rather snorted.\n\n\"Well, he's a nice-looking lad. I did admire those pants. I never could\nwear anything like that.\"\n\n\"I should hope not--at dinner! The creepy jack-ass, I don't believe he's\never been on a horse in his life! He thinks riding-breeches are the----\"\n\n\"Oh, that's it. Breeches, not pants.\"\n\n\"--last word in smartness. Overdressing is just ten degrees worse than\nunderdressing.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. Take this sloppy old blue suit of mine----\"\n\n\"It's perfectly nice and simple, and quite well cut. You probably had a\nclever tailor.\"\n\n\"I had. He lives in Chicago or New York, I believe.\"\n\n\"Really? How did he come to Schoenstrom?\"\n\n\"Never been there. This tailor is a busy boy. He fitted about eleventeen\nthousand people, last year.\"\n\n\"I see. Ready mades. Cheer up. That's where Henry B. Boltwood gets most\nof his clothes. Mr. Daggett, if ever I catch you in the\nAren't-I-beautiful frame of mind of our friend back on the porch, I'll\ngive up my trip to struggle for your soul.\"\n\n\"He seemed to have soul in large chunks. He seemed to talk pretty\npainlessly. I had a hunch you and he were discussing sculpture, anyway.\nMaybe Rodin.\"\n\n\"What do you know about Rodin?\"\n\n\"Articles in the magazines. Same place you learned about him!\" But Milt\ndid not sound rude. He said it chucklingly.\n\n\"You're perfectly right. And we've probably read the very same articles.\nWell, our friend back there said to me at dinner, 'It must be dreadful\nfor you to have to encounter so many common people along the road.' I\nsaid, 'It is,' in the most insulting tone I could, and he just rolled\nhis eyes, and hadn't an idea I meant him. Then he slickered his hair at\nme, and mooed, 'Is it not wonderful to see all these strange\nmanifestations of the secrets of Nature!' and I said, 'Is it?' and he\nwent on, 'One feels that if one could but meet a sympathetic lady here,\none's cup of rejoicing in untrammeled nature----' Honest, Milt, Mr.\nDaggett, I mean, he did talk like that. Been reading books by optimistic\nlady authors. And one looked at me, one did, as if one would be willing\nto hold my hand, if I let one.\n\n\"He invited me to come out on the porch and give the double O. to\nhandsome mountains as illuminated by terrestrial bodies, and I felt so\nweak in the presence of his conceit that I couldn't refuse. Then he\ninsisted on introducing me to a woman from my own Brooklyn, who\ncondoled with me for having to talk to Western persons while motoring.\nOh, dear God, that such people should live ... that the sniffy little\nClaire should once have been permitted to live!... And then I saw you!\"\n\nThrough all her tirade they had stood close together, her face visibly\neager in the glow from the hotel; and Milt had grown taller. But he\nresponded, \"I'm afraid I might have been just as bad. I haven't even\nreached the riding-breeches stage in evolution. Maybe never will.\"\n\n\"No. You won't. You'll go right through it. By and by, when you're so\nrich that father and I won't be allowed to associate with you, you'll\nwear riding-breeches--but for riding, not as a donation to the beauties\nof nature.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm already rich. It shows. Waitress down at the camp asked me\nwhose car I was driving through.\"\n\n\"I know what I wanted to say. Since you won't be our guest, will you be\nour host--I mean, as far as welcoming us? I think it would be fun for\nfather and me to stop at your camp, tomorrow night, at the canyon,\ninstead of at the hotel. Will you guide me to the canyon, if I do?\"\n\n\"Oh--terribly--glad!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nADVENTURERS BY FIRELIGHT\n\n\nNeither of the Boltwoods had seen the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. The\nCanyon of the Yellowstone was their first revelation of intimidating\ndepth and color gone mad. When their car and Milt's had been parked in\nthe palisaded corral back of the camp at which they were to stay, they\nthree set out for the canyon's edge chattering, and stopped dumb.\n\nMr. Boltwood declined to descend. He returned to the camp for a cigar.\nThe boy and girl crept down seeming miles of damp steps to an outhanging\npinnacle that still was miles of empty airy drop above the river bed.\nClaire had a quaking feeling that this rock pulpit was going to slide.\nShe thrust out her hand, seized Milt's paw, and in its firm warmth found\ncomfort. Clinging to its security she followed him by the crawling path\nto the river below. She looked up at columns of crimson and saffron and\nburning brown, up at the matronly falls, up at lone pines clinging to\njutting rocks that must be already crashing toward her, and in the\nsplendor she knew the Panic fear that is the deepest reaction to\nbeauty.\n\nMilt merely shook his head as he stared up. He had neither gossiped nor\ncoyly squeezed her hand as he had guided her. She fell to thinking that\nshe preferred this American boy in this American scene to a nimble\ngentleman saluting the Alps in a dinky green hat with a little feather.\n\nIt was Milt who, when they had labored back up again, when they had sat\nsmiling at each other with comfortable weariness, made her see the\ncanyon not as a freak, but as the miraculous work of a stream rolling\ngrains of sand for millions of years, till it had cut this Jovian\nintaglio. He seemed to have read--whether in books, or in paragraphs in\nmechanical magazines--a good deal about geology. He made it real. Not\nthat she paid much attention to what he actually said! She was too busy\nthinking of the fact that he should say it at all.\n\nNot condescendingly but very companionably she accompanied Milt in the\nexploration of their camp for the night--the big dining tent, the city\nof individual bedroom tents, canvas-sided and wooden-floored, each with\na tiny stove for the cold mornings of these high altitudes. She was awed\nthat evening by hearing her waitress discussing the novels of Ibanez.\nJeff Saxton knew the names of at least six Russian novelists, but Jeff\nwas not highly authoritative regarding Spanish literature.\n\n\"I suppose she's a school-teacher, working here in vacation,\" Claire\nwhispered to Milt, beside her at the long, busy, scenically\nconversational table.\n\n\"Our waitress? Well, sort of. I understand she's professor of literature\nin some college,\" said Milt, in a matter of fact way. And he didn't at\nall see the sequence when she went on:\n\n\"There is an America! I'm glad I've found it!\"\n\nThe camp's evening bonfire was made of logs on end about a stake of\niron. As the logs blazed up, the guests on the circle of benches crooned\n\"Suwanee River,\" and \"Old Black Joe,\" and Claire crooned with them. She\nhad been afraid that her father would be bored, but she saw that, above\nhis carefully tended cigar, he was dreaming. She wondered if there had\nbeen a time when he had hummed old songs.\n\nThe fire sank to coals. The crowd wandered off to their tents. Mr.\nBoltwood followed them after an apologetic, \"Good night. Don't stay up\ntoo late.\" With a scattering of only half a dozen people on the benches,\nthis huge circle seemed deserted; and Claire and Milt, leaning forward,\nchins on hands, were alone--by their own campfire, among the mountains.\n\nThe stars stooped down to the hills; the pines were a wall of blackness;\na coyote yammered to point the stillness; and the mighty pile of coals\ngave a warmth luxurious in the creeping mountain chill.\n\nThe silence of large places awes the brisk intruder, and Claire's voice\nwas unconsciously lowered as she begged, \"Tell me something about\nyourself, Mr. Daggett. I don't really know anything at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, you wouldn't be interested. Just Schoenstrom!\"\n\n\"But just Schoenstrom might be extremely interesting.\"\n\n\"But honest, you'd think I was--edging in on you!\"\n\n\"I know what you are thinking. The time I suggested, way back there in\nDakota, that you were sticking too close. You've never got over it. I've\ntried to make up for it, but---- I really don't blame you. I was horrid.\nI deserve being beaten. But you do keep on punishing ra----\"\n\n\"Punishing? Lord, I didn't mean to! No! Honest! It was nothing. You were\nright. Looked as though I was inviting myself---- But, oh, pleassssse,\nMiss Boltwood, don't ever think for a sec. that I meant to be a\ngrouch----\"\n\n\"Then do tell me---- Who is this Milton Daggett that you know so much\nbetter than I ever can?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Milt crossed his knees, caught his chin in his hand, \"I don't\nknow as I really do know him so well. I thought I did. I was onto his\nevil ways. He was the son of the pioneer doctor, Maine folks.\"\n\n\"Really? My mother came from Maine.\"\n\nMilt did not try to find out that they were cousins. He went on, \"This\nkid, Milt, went to high school in St. Cloud--town twenty times as big\nas Schoenstrom--but he drifted back because his dad was old and needed\nhim, after his mother's death----\"\n\n\"You have no brothers or sisters?\"\n\n\"No. Nobody. 'Cept Lady Vere de Vere--which animal she is going to get\ncuffed if she chews up any more of my overcoat out in my tent\ntonight!... Well, this kid worked 'round, machinery mostly, and got\ninterested in cars, and started a garage---- Wee, that was an awful\nshop, first one I had! In Rauskukle's barn. Six wrenches and a\nscrewdriver and a one-lung pump! And I didn't know a roller-bearing from\nthree-point suspension! But---- Well, anyway, he worked along, and built\na regular garage, and paid off practically all the mortgage on it----\"\n\n\"I remember stopping at a garage in Schoenstrom, I'm almost sure it was,\nfor something. I seem to remember it was a good place. Do you own it?\nReally?\"\n\n\"Ye-es, what there is of it.\"\n\n\"But there's a great deal of it. It's efficient. You've done your job.\nThat's more than most high-born aides-de-camp could say.\"\n\n\"Honestly? Well--I don't know----\"\n\n\"Who did you play with in Schoenstrom? Oh, I _wish_ I'd noticed that\ntown. But I couldn't tell then that---- What, uh, which girl did you\nfall in love with?\"\n\n\"None! Honest! None! Not one! Never fell in love----\"\n\n\"You're unfortunate. I have, lots of times. I remember quite enjoying\nbeing kissed once, at a dance.\"\n\nWhen he answered, his voice was strange: \"I suppose you're engaged to\nsomebody.\"\n\n\"No. And I don't know that I shall be. Once, I thought I liked a man,\nrather. He has nice eyes and the most correct spectacles, and he is\npolite to his mother at breakfast, and his name is Jeff, and he will\nundoubtedly be worth five or six hundred thousand dollars, some day, and\nhis opinions on George Moore and commercial paper are equally sound and\nunoriginal---- Oh, I ought not to speak of him, and I certainly ought\nnot to be spiteful. I'm not at all reticent and ladylike, am I! But----\nSomehow I can't see him out here, against a mountain of jagged rock.\"\n\n\"Only you won't always be out here against mountains. Some day you'll be\nback in--where is it in New York State?\"\n\n\"I confess it's Brooklyn--but not what you'd mean by Brooklyn. Your\nremark shows you to have subtlety. I must remember that, mustn't I! I\nwon't always be driving through this big land. But---- Will I get all\nfussy and ribbon-tied again, when I go back?\"\n\n\"No. You won't. You drive like a man.\"\n\n\"What has that----\"\n\n\"It has a lot to do with it. A garage man can trail along behind another\ncar and figger out, figure out, just about what kind of a person the\ndriver is from the way he handles his boat. Now you bite into the job.\nYou drive pretty neat--neatly. You don't either scoot too far out of the\nroad in passing a car, or take corners too wide. You won't be fussy. But\nstill, I suppose you'll be glad to be back among your own folks and\nyou'll forget the wild Milt that tagged along----\"\n\n\"Milt--or Mr. Daggett--no, Milt! I shall never, in my oldest grayest\nyear, in a ducky cap by the fireplace, forget the half-second when your\nhand came flashing along, and caught that man on the running-board. But\nit wasn't just that melodrama. If that hadn't happened, something else\nwould have, to symbolize you. It's that you--oh, you took me in, a\nstranger, and watched over me, and taught me the customs of the country,\nand were never impatient. No, I shan't forget that; neither of the\nBoltwoods will.\"\n\nIn the rose-haze of firelight he straightened up and stared at her, but\nhe settled into shyness again as she added:\n\n\"Perhaps others would have done the same thing. I don't know. If they\nhad, I should have remembered them too. But it happened that it was you,\nand I, uh, my father and I, will always be grateful. We both hope we may\nsee you in Seattle. What are you planning to do there? What is your\nambition? Or is that a rude question?\"\n\n\"Why, uh----\"\n\n\"What I mean---- I mean, how did you happen to want to go there, with a\ngarage at home? You still control it?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. Left my mechanic in charge. Why, I just kind of decided\nsuddenly. I guess it was what they call an inspiration. Always wanted a\nlong trip, anyway, and I thought maybe in Seattle I could hook up with\nsomething a little peppier than Schoenstrom. Maybe something in Alaska.\nAlways wished I were a mechanical or civil engineer so----\"\n\n\"Then why don't you become one? You're young---- How old are you?\"\n\n\"Twenty-five.\"\n\n\"We're both children, compared with Je--compared with some men who are\nmy friends. You're quite young enough to go to engineering school. And\ntake some academic courses on the side--English, so on. Why don't you?\nHave you ever thought of it?\"\n\n\"N-no, I hadn't thought of doing it, but---- All right. I will! In\nSeattle! B'lieve the University of Washington is there.\"\n\n\"You mean it?\"\n\n\"Yes. I do. You're the boss.\"\n\n\"That's--that's flattering, but---- Do you always make up your mind as\nquickly as this?\"\n\n\"When the boss gives orders!\"\n\nHe smiled, and she smiled back, but this time it was she who was\nembarrassed. \"You're rather overwhelming. You change your life--if you\nreally do mean it--because a _jeune fille_ from Brooklyn is so\nimpertinent, from her Olympian height of finishing-school learning, as\nto suggest that you do so.\"\n\n\"I don't know what a _jeune fille_ is, but I do know----\" He sprang up.\nHe did not look at her. He paraded back and forth, three steps to the\nright, three to the left, his hands in his pockets, his voice\nimpersonal. \"I know you're the finest person I ever met. You're the\nkind--I knew there must be people like you, because I knew the Joneses.\nThey're the only friends I've got that have, oh, I suppose it's what\nthey call culture.\"\n\nIn a long monologue, uninterrupted by Claire, he told of his affection\nfor the Schoenstrom \"prof\" and his wife. The practical, slangy Milt of\nthe garage was lost in the enthusiastic undergraduate adoring his\ninstructor in the university that exists as veritably in a teacher's or\na doctor's sitting-room in every Schoenstrom as it does in certain\nlugubrious stone hulks recognized by a state legislature as magically\nempowered to paste on sacred labels lettered \"Bachelor of Arts.\"\n\nHe broke from his revelations to plump down on the bench beside her, to\nslap his palm with his fist, and sigh, \"Lord, I've been gassing on!\nGuess I bored you!\"\n\n\"Oh, please, Milt, please! I see it all so---- It must have been\nwonderful, the evening when Mrs. Jones read Noyes's 'Highwayman' aloud.\nTell me--long before that--were you terribly lonely as a little boy?\"\n\nNow Milt had not been a terribly lonely little boy. He had been a leader\nin a gang devoted to fighting, swimming, pickerel-spearing,\nbeggie-stealing, and catching rides on freights.\n\nBut he believed that he was accurately presenting every afternoon of his\nchildhood, as he mused, \"Yes, I guess I was, pretty much. I remember I\nused to sit on dad's doorstep, all those long sleepy summer afternoons,\nand I'd think, 'Aw, geeeeee, I--wisht--I--had--somebody--to--play--with!'\nI always wanted to make-b'lieve Robin Hood, but none of the other\nkids--so many of them were German; they didn't know about Robin Hood; so\nI used to scout off alone.\"\n\n\"If I could only have been there, to be Maid Marian for you! We'd have\nlearned archery! Lonely little boy on the doorstep!\" Her fingers just\ntouched his sleeve. In her gesture, the ember-light caught the crystal\nof her wrist watch. She stooped to peer at it, and her pitying\ntenderness broke off in an agitated: \"Heavings! Is it that late? To bed!\nGood night, Milt.\"\n\n\"Good night, Cl---- Miss Boltwood.\"\n\n\"No. 'Claire,' of course. I'm not normally a first-name-snatcher, but I\ndo seem to have fallen into saying 'Milt.' Night!\"\n\nAs she undressed, in her tent, Claire reflected, \"He won't take\nadvantage of my being friendly, will he? Only thing is---- I sha'n't\ndare to look at Henry B. when Milt calls me 'Claire' in that sedate\nBrooklyn Heights presence. The dear lamb! Lonely afternoons----!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE BEAST OF THE CORRAL\n\n\nThey met in the frost-shimmering mountain morning, on their way to the\ncorral, to get their cars ready before breakfast. They were shy, hence\nthey were boisterous, and tremendously unreferential to campfire\nconfidences, and informative about distilled water for batteries, and\nthe price of gas in the Park. On Milt's shoulder rode Vere de Vere who,\nin her original way, relieved one pause by observing \"Mrwr.\"\n\nThey came in through the corral gate before any of the other motor\ntourists had appeared--and they stupidly halted to watch a bear, a\nlarge, black, adipose and extremely unchained bear, stalk along the line\nof cars, sniff, cock an ear at the Gomez, lumber up on its\nrunning-board, and bundle into the seat. His stern filled the space\nbetween side and top, and he was to be heard snuffing.\n\n\"Oh! Look! Milt! Left box of candy on seat---- Oh, please drive him\naway!\"\n\n\"Me? Drive--that?\"\n\n\"Frighten him away. Aren't animals afraid human eye----\"\n\n\"Not in this park. Guns forbidden. Animals protected by U. S. Army,\nPresident, Congress, Supreme Court, Department of Interior, Monroe\nDoctrine, W. C. T. U. But I'll try--cautiously.\"\n\n\"Don't you want me think you're hero?\"\n\n\"Ye-es, providin' I don't have to go and be one.\"\n\nThey edged toward the car. The bear flapped his hind legs, looked out at\nthe intruders, said \"Oofflll!\" and returned to the candy.\n\n\"Shoo!\" Milt answered politely.\n\n\"Llooffll!\"\n\nFrom his own bug, beside the Gomez, Milt got a tool kit, and with\nconsiderable brilliance as a pitcher he sent a series of wrenches at the\nagitated stern of the bear. They offended the dignity of the ward of the\nGovernment. He finished the cover and ribbons of the candy box, and\nstarted for Milt ... who proceeded with haste toward Claire ... who was\nalready at the gate.\n\nLady Vere de Vere, cat of a thousand battles, gave one frightful squawl,\nshot from Milt's shoulder and at the bear, claws out, fur electric. The\nbear carelessly batted once with its paw, and the cat sailed into the\nair. The satisfied bear strolled to the fence, shinned up it and over.\n\n\"Good old Vere! That wallop must of darn near stunned her, though!\" Milt\nlaughed to Claire, as they trotted back into the corral. The cat did not\nmove, as they came up; did not give the gallant \"Mrwr\" with which she\nhad saluted Milt on lonely morning after morning of forlorn driving\nbehind the Gomez. He picked Vere up.\n\n\"She's--she's dead,\" he said. He was crying.\n\n\"Oh, Milt---- Last night you said Vere was all the family you had. You\nhave the Boltwoods, now!\"\n\nShe did not touch his hand, nor did they speak as they walked soberly to\nthe far side of the corral, and buried Lady Vere de Vere. At breakfast\nthey talked of the coming day's run, from the canyon out of the Park,\nand northward. But they had the queer, quick casualness of intimates.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was at breakfast that her father heard one Milt Daggett address the\ndaughter of the Boltwoods as \"Claire.\" The father was surprised into\nclearing his throat, and attacking his oatmeal with a zealousness\nunnatural in a man who regarded breakfast-foods as moral rather than\ninteresting.\n\nWhile he was lighting a cigar, and Claire was paying the bill, Mr.\nBoltwood stalked Milt, cleared his throat all over again, and said,\n\"Nice morning.\"\n\nIt was the first time the two men had talked unchaperoned by Claire.\n\n\"Yes. We ought to have a good run, sir.\" The \"sir\" came hard. The\nhistorian puts forth a theory that Milt had got it out of fiction. \"We\nmight go up over Mount Washburn. Take us up to ten thousand feet.\"\n\n\"Uh, you said--didn't Miss Boltwood tell me that you are going to\nSeattle, too?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Friends there, no doubt?\"\n\nMilt grinned irresistibly. \"Not a friend. But I'm going to make 'em. I'm\ngoing to take up engineering, and some French, I guess, at the\nuniversity there.\"\n\n\"Ah. Really?\"\n\n\"Yes. Been too limited in my ambition. Don't see why I shouldn't get out\nand build railroads and power plants and roads--Siberia, Africa, all\nsorts of interesting places.\"\n\n\"Quite right. Quite right. Uh, ah, I, oh, I---- Have you seen Miss\nBoltwood?\"\n\n\"I saw Miss Boltwood in the office.\"\n\n\"Oh yes. Quite so. Uh--ah, here she is.\"\n\nWhen the Gomez had started, Mr. Boltwood skirmished, \"This young man----\nDo you think you better let him call you by your Christian name?\"\n\n\"Why not? I call him 'Milt.' 'Mr. Daggett' is too long a handle to use\nwhen a man is constantly rescuing you from the perils of the deep or\nhoboes or bears or something. Oh, I haven't told you. Poor old Milt, his\ncat was killed----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, dolly, you may tell me about that in due time, but let's\nstick to this social problem for a moment. Do you think you ought to be\ntoo intimate with him?\"\n\n\"He's only too self-respecting. He wouldn't take advantage----\"\n\n\"I'm quite aware of that. I'm not speaking on your behalf, but on his.\nI'm sure he's a very amiable chap, and ambitious. In fact---- Did you\nknow that he has saved up money to attend a university?\"\n\n\"When did he tell you that? How long has he been planning---- I thought\nthat I----\"\n\n\"Just this morning; just now.\"\n\n\"Oh! I'm relieved.\"\n\n\"I don't quite follow you, dolly, but---- Where was I? Do you realize\nwhat a demure tyrant you are? If you can drag me from New York to the\naboriginal wilds, and I did _not_ like that oatmeal, what will you do to\nthis innocent? I want to protect him!\"\n\n\"You better! Because I'm going to carve him, and paint him, and possibly\nspoil him. The creating of a man--of one who knows how to handle\nlife--is so much more wonderful than creating absurd pictures or statues\nor stories. I'll nag him into completing college. He'll learn\ndignity--or perhaps lose his simplicity and be ruined; and then I'll\nmarry him off to some nice well-bred pink-face, like Jeff Saxton's\npretty cousin--who may turn him into a beastly money-grubber; and I'm\nmonkeying with destiny, and I ought to be slapped, and I realize it, and\nI can't help it, and all my latent instinct as a feminine meddler is\naroused, and--golly, I almost went off that curve!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE BLACK DAY OF THE VOYAGE\n\n\nThat was the one black day of her voyage--black stippled with crimson.\n\nIt began with the bear's invasion of the car, resulting in long\nclaw-marks across the upholstery, the loss of some particularly good\ncandy bought at a Park hotel, and genuine grief abiding after the\nsentimental tragedy of Vere de Vere's death. The next act was the\ningenious loss of all power of her engine. She forgot that, before\nbreakfast, Milt had filled the oil-well for her. When she stopped for\ngasoline, and the seller inquired, \"Quart of oil?\"--she absently nodded.\nSo the cylinders filled with surplus oil, the spark-plugs were fouled,\nand the engine had the power of a sewing machine.\n\nShe could not make Mount Washburn--she could not make even the slopes of\nthe lower road. Now she knew the agony of the feeble car in the\nmountains--most shameful and anxious of a driver's dolors: the brisk\nstart up the hill, the belief that you will keep on going this time; the\nfeeling of weariness through all the car; the mad shifting of gears, the\nslipping of the clutch, and more gas, and less gas, and wondering\nwhether more gas or less is the better, and the appalling knocking when\nyou finally give her a lot too much gas; the remembrance, when it's too\nlate, to retard the spark; the safe crawling up to the last sharp pitch,\njust fifteen feet from the summit; the car's halting; the yelp at your\npassenger, \"Jump out and push!\"; the painful next five feet; and the\nfinal death of the power just as the front wheels creep up over the\npitch. Then the anxious putting on of brakes--holding the car with both\nfoot-brake and emergency, lest it run down backward, slip off the road.\nThe calf of your leg begins to ache from the pressure on the foot-brake,\nand with an unsuccessful effort to be courteous you bellow at the\npassenger, who has been standing beside the car looking deprecatory,\n\"Will you please block the back wheels with a stone--hustle up, will\nyou!\"\n\nAll this routine Claire thoroughly learned. Always Milt bumbled up, said\ncheerful things, and either hauled the Gomez over the pitch by a towline\nto his bug, or getting out, pushing on a rear fender till his neck was\nred and bulgy, gave the extra impetus necessary to get the Gomez over.\n\n\"Would you mind shoving on that side, just a little bit?\" he suggested\nto Mr. Boltwood, who ceased the elaborate smoking of cigars, dusted his\nhands, and gravely obeyed, while Claire was awaiting the new captain's\ncommand to throw on the power.\n\n\"I wish we weren't under so much obligation to this young man,\" said Mr.\nBoltwood, after one crisis.\n\n\"I know but--what can we do?\"\n\n\"Don't you suppose we might pay him?\"\n\n\"Henry B. Boltwood, if you tried to do that---- I'm not sure. Your being\nmy parent might save you, but even so, I think he'd probably chase you\noff the road, clear down into that chasm.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. Shall we have to entertain him in Seattle?\"\n\n\"Have to? My dear parent, you can't keep me from it! Any of the Seattle\nfriends of Gene Gilson who don't appreciate that straight, fine,\naspiring boy may go---- Not overdo it, you understand. But---- Oh, take\nhim to the theater. By the way; shall we try to climb Mount Rainier\nbefore----\"\n\n\"See here, my good dolly; you stop steering me away from my feeble\nparental efforts. Do you wish to be under obligations----\"\n\n\"Don't mind, with Milt. He wouldn't charge interest, as Jeff Saxton\nwould. Milt is, oh, he's folks!\"\n\n\"Quite true. But are we? Are you?\"\n\n\"Learning to be!\"\n\nBetween discussions and not making hills, Claire cleaned the spark plugs\nas they accumulated carbon from the surplus oil--or she pretended to\nhelp Milt clean them. The plugs were always very hot, and when you were\nunscrewing the jacket from the core, you always burned your hand, and\nwished you could swear ... and sometimes you could.\n\nAfter noon, when they had left the Park and entered Gardiner, Milt\nannounced, \"I've got to stick around a while. The key in my\nsteering-gear seems to be worn. May have to put in a new one. Get the\nstuff at a garage here. If you wouldn't mind waiting, be awful glad to\ntag, and try to give a few helping hands till the oil cleans itself\nout.\"\n\n\"I'll just stroll on,\" she said, but she drove away as swiftly as she\ncould. Her father's worry about obligations disturbed her, and she did\nnot wish to seem too troublesome an amateur to Milt. She would see him\nin Livingston, and tell him how well she had driven. The spark plugs\nkept clean enough now so that she could command more power, but----\n\nBetween the Park and the transcontinental road there are many climbs\nshort but severely steep; up-shoots like the humps on a scenic railway.\nTo tackle them with her uncertain motor was like charging a machine-gun\nnest. She spent her nerve-force lavishly, and after every wild rush to\nmake a climb, she had to rest, to rub the suddenly aching back of her\nneck. Because she was so tired, she did not take the trouble to save her\nbrakes by going down in gear. She let the brakes smoke while the river\nand railroad below rose up at her.\n\nThere was a long drop. How long it was she did not guess, because it was\nconcealed by a curve at the top. She seemed to plane down forever. The\nbrakes squealed behind. She tried to shift to first but there was a\njarring snarl, and she could neither get into first nor back into third.\nShe was running in neutral, the great car coasting, while she tried to\nslow it by jamming down the foot-brake. The car halted--and started on\nagain. The brake-lining which had been wished on her at Saddle Back was\nburnt out.\n\nShe had the feeling of the car bursting out from under control ... ready\nto leap off the road, into a wash. She wanted to jump. It took all her\ncourage to stay in the seat. She got what pressure she could from the\nremaining band. With one hand she kept the accelerating car in the\nmiddle of the road; with the other she tried to pull the handle of the\nemergency brake back farther. She couldn't. She was not strong enough.\nFaster, faster, rushing at the next curve so that she could scarce steer\nround it----\n\nAs quietly as she could, she demanded of her father, \"Pull back on this\nbrake lever, far as you can. Take both hands.\"\n\n\"I don't understand----\"\n\n\"Heavens! Y' don't haft un'stand! Yank back! Yank, I tell you!\"\n\nAgain the car slowed. She was able to get into second speed. Even that\ncheck did not keep the car from darting down at thirty miles an\nhour--which pace, to one who desires to saunter down at a dignified rate\nof eighteen, is equivalent in terms of mileage on level ground to\nseventy an hour, with a drunken driver, on a foggy evening, amid\ntraffic.\n\nShe got the car down and, in the midst of a valley of emptiness and\nquiet, she dropped her head on her father's knee and howled.\n\n\"I just can't face going down another hill! I just can't face it!\" she\nsobbed.\n\n\"No, dolly. Mustn't. We better---- You're quite right. This young\nDaggett is a very gentlemanly fellow. I didn't think his\ntable-manners---- But we'll sit here and regard the flora and fauna till\nhe comes. He'll see us through.\"\n\n\"Yes! He will! Honestly, dad----\" She said it with the first touch of\nhero-worship since she had seen an aviator loop loops. \"Isn't he, oh,\neffective! Aren't you glad he's here to help us, instead of somebody\nlike Jeff Saxton?\"\n\n\"We-ul, you must remember that Geoffrey wouldn't have permitted the\nbrake to burn out. He'd have foreseen it, and have had a branch office,\nwith special leased wire, located back on that hill, ready to do\nbusiness the instant the market broke. Enthusiasm is a nice quality,\ndolly, but don't misplace it. This lad, however trustworthy he may be,\nwould scarcely even be allowed to work for a man like Geoffrey Saxton.\nIt may be that later, with college----\"\n\n\"No. He'd work for Jeff two hours. Then Jeff would give him that 'You\npoor fish!' look, and Milt would hit him, and stroll out, and go to the\nNorth Pole or some place, and discover an oil-well, and hire Jeff as his\nnice, efficient general manager. And---- I do wish Milt would hurry,\nthough!\"\n\nIt was dusk before they heard the pit-pit-pit chuckling down the hill.\nMilt's casual grin changed to bashfulness as Claire ran into the road,\nher arms wide in a lovely gesture of supplication, and cried, \"We been\nwaiting for you so long! One of my brake-bands is burnt out, and the\nother is punk.\"\n\n\"Well, well. Let's try to figure out something to do.\"\n\nShe waited reverently while the local prophet sat in his bug, stared at\nthe wheels of the Gomez, and thought. The level-floored,\nsagebrush-sprinkled hollow had filled with mauve twilight and creeping\nstilly sounds. The knowable world of yellow lights and security was far\naway. Milt was her only means of ever getting back to it.\n\n\"Tell you what we might try,\" he speculated. \"I'll hitch on behind you,\nand hold back in going down hill.\"\n\nShe did not even try to help him while he again cleaned the spark plugs\nand looked over brakes, oil, gas, water. She sat on the running-board,\nand it was pleasant to be relieved of responsibility. He said nothing at\nall. While he worked he whistled that recent refined ballad:\n\n    I wanta go back to Oregon\n    And sit on the lawn, and look at the dawn.\n    Oh motheruh dear, don't leavuh me here,\n    The leaves are so sere, in the fallothe year,\n    I wanta go back to Oregugon,\n    To dearuh old Oregugon.\n\nThey started, shouting optimistically to each other, lights on, trouble\nseeming over--and they stopped after the next descent, and pools of\ntears were in the corners of Claire's eyes. The holdback had not\nsucceeded. Her big car, with its quick-increasing momentum, had jerked\nat the bug as though it were a lard-can. The tow-rope had stretched,\nsung, snapped, and again, in fire-shot delirium, she had gone rocking\ndown hill.\n\nHe drove up beside her, got out, stood at her elbow. His \"I'm a bum\ninventor. We'll try somethin' else\" was so careless that, in her\nnerve-twanging exhaustion she wailed, \"Oh, don't be so beastly cheerful!\nYou don't care a bit!\"\n\nIn the dusk she could see him straighten, and his voice came sharp as he\nignored the ever-present parental background and retorted, \"Somebody has\ngot to be cheerful. Matter fact, I worked out the right stunt, coming\ndown.\"\n\nLike a man in the dentist's chair, recovering between bouts, she drowsed\nand ignored the fact that in a few minutes she would again have to\nreassemble herself, become wakeful and calm, and go through quite\nimpossible maneuvers of driving. Milt was, with a hatchet from his\ncamping-kit, cutting down a large scrub pine. He dragged it to the Gomez\nand hitched it to the back axle. The knuckles of the branches would dig\ninto the earth, the foliage catch at every pebble.\n\n\"There! That anchor would hold a truck!\" he shouted.\n\nIt held. She went down the next two hills easily. But she was through.\nHer forearms and brain were equally numb. She appealed to Milt, \"I can't\nseem to go on any more. It's so dark, and I'm so tired----\"\n\n\"All right. No ranch houses anywheres near, so we'll camp here, if Mr.\nBoltwood doesn't mind.\"\n\nClaire stirred herself to help him prepare dinner. It wasn't much of a\ndinner to prepare. Both cars had let provisions run low. They had bacon\nand petrified ends of a loaf and something like coffee--not much like\nit. Scientists may be interested in their discovery that as a substitute\nfor both cream and sugar in beverages strawberry jam is a fallacy.\n\nFor Mr. Boltwood's bed Milt hauled out the springy seat-cushions of both\ncars. The Gomez cushion was three inches thicker than that of the bug,\nwhich resulted in a mattress two stories in front with a lean-to at the\nfoot, and the entire edifice highly slippery. But with a blanket from\nMilt's kit, it was sufficient. To Claire, Milt gave another blanket,\nhis collection of antique overcoats, and good advice. He spoke vaguely\nof a third blanket for himself. And he had one. Its dimensions were\nthirteen by twenty inches, it was of white wool, he had bought it in\nDakota for Vere de Vere, and many times that day he had patted it and\nwhispered, \"Poor old cat.\"\n\nUnder his blankets Mr. Boltwood thought of rattlesnakes, bears,\nrheumatism, Brooklyn, his debt to Milt, and the fact that--though he\nhadn't happened to mention it to Claire--he had expected to be killed\nwhen the brake had burned out.\n\nClaire was drowsily happy. She had got through. She was conscious of\nrustling sagebrush, of the rapids of the Yellowstone beside her, of open\nsky and sweet air and a scorn for people in stuffy rooms, and\ncomfortably ever conscious of Milt, ten feet away. She had in him the\ninterest that a young physician would have in a new X-ray machine, a\nprinter in a new font of type, any creator in a new outlet for his\npower. She would see to it that her Seattle cousins, the Gilsons, helped\nhim to know the right people, during his university work. She herself\nwould be back in Brooklyn, but perhaps he would write to her,\nwrite--write letters--Brooklyn--she was in Brooklyn--no, no, where was\nshe?--oh, yes, camping--bad day--brakes---- No, she would not marry Jeff\nSaxton! Brooklyn--river singing--stars----\n\nAnd when Milt wasn't unromantically thinking of his cold back, he\nexulted. \"She won't be back among her own folks till Seattle. Probably\nforget me then. Don't blame her. But till we get there, she'll let me\nplay in her yard. Gee! In the morning I'll be talking to her again, and\nshe's right there, right now!\"\n\nIn the morning they were all very stiff, but glad of the sun on\nsagebrush and river, and the boy and girl sang over breakfast. While\nMilt was gathering fuel he looked up at Claire standing against a\nbackground of rugged hills, her skirt and shoes still smug, but her\njacket off, her blouse turned in at the throat, her hair blowing, her\nsleeves rolled up, one hand on her hip, erect, charged with vigor--the\nspirit of adventure.\n\nWhen her brake had been relined, at Livingston, they sauntered\ncompanionably on to Butte. And the day after Butte, when Milt was half a\nmile behind the Gomez, a pink-haired man with a large, shiny revolver\nstepped out from certain bushes, and bowed politely, and at that point\nMilt stopped.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE SPECTACLES OF AUTHORITY\n\n\nOver the transcontinental divide and into Butte, diamond-glittering on\nits hills in the dark; into Missoula, where there are trees and a\nuniversity, with a mountain in everybody's backyard; through the\nFlathead Agency, where scarlet-blanketed Indians stalk out of tepees and\nthe papoose rides on mother's back as in forgotten days; down to St.\nIgnatius, that Italian Alp town with its old mission at the foot of\nmountains like the wall of Heaven, Claire had driven west, then north.\nShe was sailing past Flathead Lake, where fifty miles of mountain glory\nare reflected in bright waters. Everywhere were sections of flat\nwheat-plains, stirring with threshing, with clattering machinery and the\nflash of blown straw. But these miniature prairies were encircled by\nabrupt mountains.\n\nMr. Boltwood remarked, \"I'd rather have one of these homesteads and look\nacross my fields at those hills than be King of England.\" Not that he\nmade any effort to buy one of the homesteads. But then, he made no\nappreciable effort to become King of England.\n\nClaire had not seen Milt for a day and a half; not since the morning\nwhen both cars had left Butte. She wondered, and was piqued, and\nslightly lonely. Toward evening, when she was speculating as to whether\nshe would make Kalispell--almost up to the Canadian border--she saw a\nwoman run into the road from a house on the shore of Flathead Lake. The\nwoman held out her hand. Claire pulled up.\n\n\"Are you Miss Boltwood?\"\n\nIt was as startling as the same question would have been in a Chinese\nvillage.\n\n\"W-why, yes.\"\n\n\"Somebody trying to get you on the long-distance 'phone.\"\n\n\"Me? 'Phone?\"\n\nShe was trembling. \"Something's happened to Milt. He needs me!\" She\ncould not manage her voice, as she got the operator on the farmers'-line\nwire, and croaked, \"Was some one trying to get Miss Boltwood?\"\n\n\"Yes. This Boltwood? Hotel in Kalispell trying to locate you, for two\nhours. Been telephoning all along the line, from Butte to Somers.\"\n\n\"W-well, w-will you g-get 'em for me?\"\n\nIt was not Milt's placid and slightly twangy voice but one smoother,\nmore decisive, perplexingly familiar, that finally vibrated, \"Hello!\nHello! Miss Boltwood! Operator, I can't hear. Get me a better\nconnection. Miss Boltwood?\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes! This is Miss Boltwood!\" she kept beseeching, during a long\nand not unheated controversy between the unknown and the crisp operator,\nwho knew nothing of the English language beyond, \"Here's your party. Why\ndon't you talk? Speak louder!\"\n\nThen came clearly, \"Hear me now?\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes!\"\n\n\"Miss Boltwood?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Oh. Oh, hello, Claire. This is Jeff.\"\n\n\"Jess who?\"\n\n\"Not Jess. Jeff! Geoffrey! J-e-f-f! Jeff Saxton!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" It was like a sob. \"Why--why--but you're in New York.\"\n\n\"Not exactly, dear. I'm in Kalispell, Montana.\"\n\n\"But that's right near here.\"\n\n\"So am I!\"\n\n\"B-but----\"\n\n\"Out West to see copper interests. Traced you from Yellowstone Park but\nmissed you at Butte. Thought I'd catch you on road. You talking from\nBarmberry's?\"\n\nThe woman who had hailed her was not missing a word of a telephone\nconversation which might be relative to death, fire, elopement, or any\nother dramatic event. Claire begged of her, \"Where in the world am I\ntalking from, anyway?\"\n\n\"This is Barmberry's Inn.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Claire answered on the telephone, \"I seem to be. Shall I start on\nand----\"\n\n\"No. Got ripping plan. Stay right where you are. Got a fast car waiting.\nBe right down. We'll have dinner. By!\"\n\nA click. No answer to Claire's urgent hellos. She hung up the receiver\nvery, very carefully. She hated to turn and face her audience of Mr.\nHenry B. Boltwood, Mr. James Barmberry, Mrs. James Barmberry, and four\nBarmberry buds averaging five and a quarter in age. She tried to ignore\nthe Barmberrys, but their silence was noisy and interested while she\ninformed her father, \"It's Jeff Saxton! Out here to see copper mines.\nTelephoned along road to catch us. Says we're to wait dinner till he\ncomes.\"\n\n\"Yessum,\" Mrs. Barmberry contributed, \"he told me if I did catch you, I\nwas to have some new-killed chickens ready to fry, and some whipped\ncream---- Jim Barmberry, you go right out and finish whipping that\ncream, and don't stand there gawping and gooping, and you children, you\nscat!\"\n\nClaire seized the moment of Mr. Boltwood's lordly though bewildered bow\nto their hostess, and escaped outdoors. Round the original settler's\nlog-cabin were nests of shacks and tents, for bedrooms, and on a\nscreened porch, looking on Flathead Lake, was the dining-room. The few\nother guests had finished supper and gone to their tents.\n\nShe ambled to the lake shore, feeling feebler, more slapped and sent\nback to be a good little girl, than she had when Milt had hitched a\nforest to the back axle, three days ago. A map of her thoughts about\nJeff Saxton would have shown a labyrinth. Now, she was muttering, \"Dear\nJeff! So thoughtful! Clever of him to find me! So good to see him\nagain!\" Now: \"It's still distinctly understood that I am not engaged to\nhim, and I'm not going to be surprised into kissing him when he comes\ndown like a wolf on the fold.\" Now: \"Jeff Saxton! Here! Makes me\nhomesick for the Heights. And nice shops in Manhattan, and a really good\nplay--music just before the curtain goes up.\" Now: \"Ohhhhhh geeeeee\nwhizzzzzz! I wonder if he'll let us go any farther in the car? He's so\nmanagerial, and dad is sure to take his side. He tried to scare us off\nby that telegram to Fargo.\" Now: \"He'd be horrified if he knew about\nthat bum brake. Milt didn't mind. Milt likes his womenfolks to be\ndaring. Jeff wants his harem admiring and very reliable.\"\n\nShe crouched on the shore, a rather forlorn figure. The peaks of the\nMission Range, across the violet-shadowed mirror of Flathead Lake, were\na sudden pure rose, in reflection of sunset, then stony, forbidding.\nAcross the road, on the Barmberry porch, she could hear her father\nsaying \"Ah?\" and \"Indeed?\" to James's stories.\n\nUp the road, a blaring horn, great lights growing momently more\ndazzling, a roar, a rush, the halting car, and out of its blurred bulk,\na trim figure darting--Jeff Saxton--home and the people she loved, and\nthe ways and days she knew best of all. He had shouted only \"Is\nMiss----\" before she had rushed to him, into the comfort of his arms,\nand kissed him.\n\nShe backed off and tried to sound as if it hadn't happened, but she was\nquavery: \"I can't believe it! It's too ridiculously wonderful to see\nyou!\" She retreated toward the Barmberry porch, Jeff following, his two\nhands out. They came within the range of the house lights, and Mr.\nBoltwood hailed, \"Ah! Geoffrey! Never had such a surprise--nor a more\ndelightful one!\"\n\n\"Mr. Boltwood! Looking splendid, sir! New man! William Street better\nlook to its laurels when you come back and get into the game!\"\n\nThen, on the lamp-lighted porch, the two men shook hands, and looked for\nsome other cordial thing to do. They thought about giving each other\ncigars. They smiled, and backed away, and smiled, in the foolish,\nindeterminate way males have, being unable to take it out in kissing.\nMr. Boltwood solved the situation by hemming, \"Must trot in and wash.\nSee you very soon.\" Mr. James Barmberry and the squad of lesser\nBarmberrys regretfully followed. Claire was alone with Jeff, and she was\nfrightened. Yet she was admitting that Jeff, in his English cap and\nflaring London top-coat, his keen smile and his extreme shavedness, was\nmore attractive than she had remembered.\n\n\"Glad to see me?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Oh, rather!\"\n\n\"You're looking----\"\n\n\"You're so----\"\n\n\"Nice trip? You know you've sent me nothing but postcards with 'Pretty\ntown,' or something equally sentimental.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's really been bully. These mountains and big spaces simply\ninspire me.\" She said it rather defiantly.\n\n\"Of course they do! Trouble is, with you away, we've nothing to inspire\nus!\"\n\n\"Do you need anything, with your office and your club?\"\n\n\"Why, Claire!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. That was horrid of me.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was. Though I don't mind. I'm sure we've all become meek,\nmissing you so. I'm quite willing to be bullied, and reminded that I'm a\nmere T.B.M.\"\n\nShe had got herself into it; she had to tell him that he wasn't just a\nbusiness man; that she had \"just meant\" he was so practical.\n\n\"But Jeff is no longer the practical one,\" he declared. \"Think of Claire\ndriving over deserts and mountains. But---- Oh, it's been so lonely for\nus. Can you guess how much? A dozen times every evening, I've turned to\nthe telephone to call you up and beg you to let me nip in and see you,\nand then realized you weren't there, and I've just sat looking at the\n'phone---- Oh, other people are so dull!\"\n\n\"You really miss----\"\n\n\"I wish I were a poet, so I could tell you adequately. But you haven't\nsaid you missed me, Claire. Didn't you, a teeny bit? Wouldn't it have\nbeen tolerable to have poor old Jeff along, to drive down dangerous\nhills----\"\n\n\"And fill grease-cups! Nasty and stickum on the fingers!\"\n\n\"Yes, I'd have done that, too. And invented surprises along the way. I'm\na fine surpriser! I've arranged for a motor-boat so we can explore the\nlake here tomorrow. That's why I had you wait here instead of coming on\nto Kalispell. Tomorrow morning, unfortunately, I have to hustle back and\ncatch a train--called to California, and possibly a northern trip. But\nmeantime---- By now, my driver must have sneaked my s'prises into the\nkitchen.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"Guess.\"\n\n\"Food. Eats. Divine eats.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"But what? Please, sir. Claire is so hungry.\"\n\n\"We shall see in time, my child. Uncle Jeff is not to be hurried.\"\n\n\"Ah--let--me--see--now! I'll kick and scream!\"\n\nFrom New York Jeff had brought a mammoth picnic basket. To the fried\nchicken ordered for dinner he added sealed jars of pur\u00c3\u00a9e of wood pigeon,\nof stuffed artichokes prepared by his club chef; caviar and anchovies; a\nmarvelous nightmare-creating fruit cake to go with the whipped cream;\ntwo quarts of a famous sherry; candied fruits in a silver box. Dinner\nwas served not on the dining-porch but before the fire in the\nBarmberrys' living-room. Claire looked at the candied fruits, stared at\nJeff rather queerly--as though she was really thinking of some one\nelse--and mused:\n\n\"I didn't know I cared so much for these foolish luxuries. Tonight, I'd\nlike a bath, just a tiny bit scented, and a real dressing-table with a\ntriple mirror, and French talc, and come down in a dinner-gown---- Oh, I\nhave enjoyed the trip, Jeff. But my poor body does get so tired and\ndusty, and then you treacherously come along with these things that\nyou've magicked out of the mountains and---- I'm not a pioneer woman,\nafter all. And Henry B. is not a caveman. See him act idolatrously\ntoward his soup.\"\n\n\"I feel idolatrous. I'd forgotten the supreme ethical importance of the\nsoup. I'll never let myself forget it again,\" said Mr. Boltwood, in the\ntone of one who has come home.\n\nClaire was grateful to Jeff that he did not let her go on being\ngrateful. He turned the talk to Brooklyn. He was neat and explicit--and\nalmost funny--in his description of an outdoor presentation of\n_Midsummer Night's Dream_, in which a domestic and intellectual lady\nweighing a hundred and eighty-seven stageside had enacted Puck. As they\nsat after dinner, as Claire shivered, he produced a knitted robe, and\npulled it about her shoulders, smiling at her in a lonely, hungry way.\nShe caught his hand.\n\n\"Nice Jeff!\" she whispered.\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" he implored. He shook his head in a wistful way that\ncaught her heart, and dutifully went back to informing Mr. Boltwood of\nthe true state of the markets.\n\n\"Talk to Claire too!\" she demanded. She stopped, stared. From outside\nshe heard a nervous pit-pit-pit, a blurred dialogue between Mr. James\nBarmberry and another man. Into the room rambled Milt Daggett, dusty of\nunpressed blue suit, tired of eyes, and not too well shaved of chin,\ngrumbling, \"Thought I'd never catch up with you, Claire---- Why----\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh, Milt--Mr. Daggett---- Oh, Jeff, this is our good friend Milt\nDaggett, who has helped us along the road.\"\n\nJeff's lucid rimless spectacles stared at Milt's wind-reddened eyes; his\njaunty patch-pocket outing clothes sniffed at Milt's sweater; his even\nvoice followed Milt's grunt of surprise with a curt \"Ah. Mr. Daggett.\"\n\n\"Pleased meet you,\" faltered Milt.\n\nJeff nodded, turned his shoulder on Milt, and went on, \"The fact is, Mr.\nBoltwood, the whole metal market----\"\n\nMilt was looking from one to another. Claire was now over her first\nshocked comparison of candied fruits with motor grease. She rose, moved\ntoward Milt, murmuring, \"Have you had dinner?\"\n\nThe door opened again. A pink-haired, red-faced man in a preposterous\ngreen belted suit lunged in, swept his broad felt hat in greeting, and\nboomed like a cheap actor:\n\n\"Friends of my friend Milt, we about to dine salute you. Let me\nintroduce myself as Westlake Parrott, better known to the vulgar as\nPinky Parrott, gentleman adventurer, born in the conjunction of Mars and\nVenus, with Saturn ascendant.\"\n\nJeff had ignored Milt. But at this absurd second intrusion on his\ndecidedly private dinner-party he flipped to the center of the room and\nsaid \"I beg your pardon!\" in such a head-office manner that the\npink-locked Mystery halted in his bombast. Claire felt wabbly. She had\nno theories as to where Milt had acquired a private jester, nor as to\nwhat was about to happen to Milt--and possibly to her incautious self.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE VAGABOND IN GREEN\n\n\nAs Milt had headed westward from Butte, as he rattled peacefully along\nthe road, conscious of golden haze over all the land, and the\nunexpectedness of prairie threshing-crews on the sloping fields of\nmountainsides, a man had stepped out from bushes beside the road, and\npointed a .44 navy revolver.\n\nThe man was not a movie bandit. He wore a green imitation of a Norfolk\njacket, he had a broad red smile, and as he flourished his hat in a bow,\nhis hair was a bristly pompadour of gray-streaked red that was almost\npink. He made oration:\n\n\"Pardon my eccentric greeting, brother of the open road, but I wanted\nyou to give ear to my obsequious query as to how's chances on gettin' a\nlift? I have learned that obsequiousness is best appreciated when it is\nbacked up by prayer and ca'tridges.\"\n\n\"What's the idea? I seem to gather you'd like a lift. Jump in.\"\n\n\"You do not advocate the Ciceronian style, I take it,\" chuckled the man\nas he climbed aboard.\n\nMilt was not impressed. Claire might have been, but Milt had heard\npolitics and religion argued about the stove in Rauskukle's store too\noften to be startled by polysyllabomania. He knew it was often the sign\nof a man who has read too loosely and too much by himself. He snorted.\n\"Huh! What are you--newspaper, politics, law, preacher, or gambler?\"\n\n\"Well, a little of all those interesting occupations. And\nten-twent-thirt trouping, and county-fair spieling, and selling Dr.\nThunder Rapids' Choctaw Herbal Sensitizer. How far y' going?\"\n\n\"Seattle.\"\n\n\"Honest? Say, kid, this is---- Muh boy, we shall have the rare privilege\nof pooling adventures as far as Blewett Pass, four to six days' run from\nhere--a day this side of Seattle. I'm going to my gold-mine there. I'll\nsplit up on the grub--I note from your kit that you camp nights. Quite\nall right, my boy. Pinky Parrott is no man to fear night air.\"\n\nHe patted Milt's shoulder with patronizing insolence. He filled a pipe\nand, though the car was making twenty-five, he lighted the pipe with\ndistinguished ease, then settled down to his steady stride:\n\n\"In the pride of youth, you feel that you have thoroughly categorized\nme, particularly since I am willing to admit that, though I shall have\nabundance of the clinking iron men to buy my share of our chow, I chance\njust for the leaden-footed second to lack the wherewithal to pay my\nrailroad fare back to Blewett; and the bumpers and side-door Pullman of\nthe argonauts like me not. Too damn dusty. But your analysis is\nunsynthetic, though you will scarce grasp my paradoxical metaphor.\"\n\n\"The hell I won't. I've taken both chemistry and rhetoric,\" growled\nMilt, strictly attending to driving, and to the desire to get rid of his\nparasite.\n\n\"Oh! Oh, I see. Well, anyway: I am no mere nimble knight of wits, as you\nmay take it. In fact, I am lord of fair acres in Arcady.\"\n\n\"Don't know the burg. Montana or Idaho?\"\n\n\"Neither! In the valley of dream!\"\n\n\"Oh! That one. Huh!\"\n\n\"But I happen to back them up with a perfectly undreamlike gold-mine.\nProspected for it in a canyon near Blewett Pass and found it, b' gum,\nand my lady wife, erstwhile fairest among the society favorites of North\nYakima, now guards it against her consort's return. Straight goods. Got\nthe stuff. Been to Butte to get a raise on it, but the fell khedives of\ncommerce are jealous. They would hearken not. Gee, those birds certainly\ndid pull the frigid mitt! So I wend my way back to the demure Dolores,\nthe houri of my heart, and the next time I'll take a crack at the big\nguns in Seattle. And I'll sure reward you for your generosity in taking\nme to Blewett, all the long, long, languid, languorous way----\"\n\n\"Too bad I got to stop couple of days at Spokane.\"\n\n\"Well, then you shall have the pleasure of taking me that far.\"\n\n\"And about a week in Kalispell!\"\n\n\"'Twill discommode me, but 'pon honor, I like your honest simple face,\nand I won't desert you. Besides! I know a guy in Kalispell, and I can\npanhandle the sordid necessary chuck while I wait for you. Little you\nknow, my cockerel, how facile a brain your 'bus so lightly bears. When\nI've cashed in on the mine, I'll take my rightful place among the\nmotored gentry. Not merely as actor and spieler, promoter and inventor\nand soldier and daring journalist, have I played my r\u00c3\u00b4le, but also I am\na mystic, an initiate, a clairaudient, a psychometrist, a Rosicrucian\nadept, and profoundly psychic--in fact, my guide is Hermes Trismegistus\nhimself! I also hold a degree as doctor of mento-practic, and my studies\nin astro-biochemistry----\"\n\n\"Gonna stop. All off. Make little coffee,\" said Milt.\n\nHe did not desire coffee, and he did not desire to stop, but he did\ndesperately desire not to inflict Pinky Parrott upon the Boltwoods. It\nwas in his creed as a lover of motors never to refuse a ride to any one,\nwhen he had room. He hoped to get around his creed by the hint implied\nin stopping. Pinky's reaction to the hint was not encouraging:\n\n\"Why, you have a touch of the psychic's flare! I could do with coffee\nmyself. But don't trouble to make a fire. I'll do that. You drive--I do\nthe camp work. Not but that I probably drive better than you, if you\nwill permit me to say so. I used to do a bit of racing, before I took up\naviation.\"\n\n\"Huh! Aviation! What machine d'you fly?\"\n\n\"Why, why--a biplane!\"\n\n\"Huh! What kind of motor?\"\n\n\"Why, a foreign one. The--the---- It was a French motor.\"\n\n\"Huh! What track you race on?\"\n\n\"The---- Pardon me till I build a fire for our _al fresco_ collation,\nand I my driving history will unfold.\"\n\nBut he didn't do either.\n\nAfter he had brought seven twigs, one piece of sagebrush, and a six-inch\nboard, Pinky let Milt finish building the fire, while he told how much\nhe knew about the mysteries of ancient Egyptian priests.\n\nMilt gave up hope that Pinky would become bored by waiting and tramp on.\nAfter one hour of conversational deluge, he decided to let Pinky\ndrive--to make him admit that he couldn't. He was wrong. Pinky could\ndrive. He could not drive well, he wabbled in his steering, and he\nkilled the engine on a grade, but he showed something of the same\ndashing idiocy that characterized his talk. It was Milt not Pinky, who\nwas afraid of their running off the road, and suggested resuming the\nwheel.\n\nSeven times that day Milt tried to lose him. Once he stopped without\nexcuse, and merely stared up at rocks overhanging the hollowed road.\nPinky was not embarrassed. He leaned back in the seat and sang two\nSpanish love songs. Once Milt deliberately took a wrong road, up a\nmountainside. They were lost, and took five hours getting back to the\nhighway. Pinky loved the thrill and--in a brief address lasting fifteen\nminutes--he said so.\n\nMilt tried to bore him by driving at seven miles an hour. Pinky\naffectionately accepted this opportunity to study the strata of the\nhills. When they camped, that night, Pinky loved him like a brother, and\nwas considering not stopping at Blewett Pass, to see his gold-mine and\nDolores the lady-wife, but going clear on to Seattle with his playmate.\n\nThe drafted host lay awake, and when Pinky awoke and delivered a few\nwell-chosen words on the subject of bird-song at dawn, Milt burst out:\n\n\"Pinky, I don't like to do it, but---- I've never refused a fellow a\nlift, but I'm afraid you'll have to hike on by yourself, the rest of the\nway.\"\n\nPinky sat up in his blankets. \"Afraid of me, eh? You better be! I'm a\nbad actor. I killed Dolores's husband, and took her along, see? I----\"\n\n\"Are you trying to scare me, you poor four-flusher?\" Milt's right hand\nexpanded, fingers arching, with the joyous tension of a man stretching.\n\n\"No. I'm just reading your thoughts. I'm telling you you're scared of\nme! You think that if I went on, I might steal your car! You're afraid\nbecause I'm so suave. You aren't used to smooth ducks. You don't dare to\nlet me stick with you, even for today! You're afraid I'd have your\nmis'able car by tonight! You don't dare!\"\n\n\"The hell I don't!\" howled Milt. \"If you think I'm afraid---- Just to\nshow you I'm not, I'll let you go on today!\"\n\n\"That's sense, my boy. It would be a shame for two such born companions\nof the road to part!\" Pinky had soared up from his blankets; was\nlovingly shaking Milt's hand.\n\nMilt knew that he had been tricked, but he felt hopeless. Was it\nimpossible to insult Pinky? He tried again:\n\n\"I'll be frank with you. You're the worst wind-jamming liar I ever met.\nNow don't reach for that gat of yours. I've got a hefty rock right here\nhandy.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, dear boy, I don't intend to reach for any crude lethal\nsmoke-wagon. Besides, there isn't anything in it. I hocked the shells in\nButte. I am not angry, merely grieved. We'll argue this out as we have\nbreakfast and drive on. I can prove to you that, though occasionally I\nlet my fancy color mere untutored fact with the pigments of a Robert J.\nIngersoll---- By the way, do you know his spiel on whisky?\"\n\n\"Stick to the subject. We'll finish our arguing right now, and I'll\ngive you breakfast, and we'll sadly part.\"\n\n\"Merely because I am lighter of spirits than this lugubrious old world?\nNo! I decline to be dropped. I'll forgive you and go on with you. Mind\nyou, I am sensitive. I will not intrude where I am not welcome. Only you\nmust give me a sounder reason than my diverting conversational powers\nfor shucking me. My logic is even stronger than my hedonistic contempt\nfor hitting the pike.\"\n\n\"Well, hang it, if you must know---- Hate to say it, but I'd do almost\nanything to get rid of you. Fact is, I've been sort of touring with a\nlady and her father, and you would be in the way!\"\n\n\"Aaaaaaah! You see! Why, my boy, I will not only stick, but for you, I\nshall do the nimble John Alden and win the lady fair. I will so bedizen\nyour virile, though somewhat crassly practical gifts---- Why, women are\nmy long suit. They fall for----\"\n\n\"Tut, tut, tut! You're a fool. She's no beanery mistress, like you're\nused to. She really is a lady.\"\n\n\"How blind you are, cruel friend. You do not even see that whatever my\nvices may be, my social standing----\"\n\n\"Oh--shut--up! Can't you see I'm trying to be kind to you? Have I simply\ngot to beat you up before you begin to suspect you aren't welcome? Your\nsocial standing isn't even in the telephone book. And your\nvocabulary---- You let too many 'kids' slip in among the juicy words.\nHave I got to lick----\"\n\n\"Well. You're right. I'm a fliv. Shake hands, m' boy, and no hard\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"Good. Then I can drive on nice and alone, without having to pound your\nears off?\"\n\n\"Certainly. That is--we'll compromise. You take me on just a few miles,\ninto more settled country, and I'll leave you.\"\n\nSo it chanced that Milt was still inescapably accompanied by Mr. Pinky\nParrott, that evening, when he saw Claire's Gomez standing in the yard\nat Barmberry's and pulled up.\n\nPinky had voluntarily promised not to use his eloquence on Claire, nor\nto try to borrow money from Mr. Boltwood. Without ever having quite won\npermission to stay, he had stayed. He had also carried out his promise\nto buy his half of the provisions by adding a five-cent bag of lemon\ndrops to Milt's bacon and bread.\n\nWhen they had stopped, Milt warned, \"There's their machine now. Seems to\nbe kind of a hotel here. I'm going in and say howdy. Good-by, Pink. Glad\nto have met you, but I expect you to be gone when I come out here again.\nIf you aren't---- Want granite or marble for the headstone? I mean it,\nnow!\"\n\n\"I quite understand, my lad. I admire your chivalric delicacy. Farewell,\nold _compagnon de voyage_!\"\n\nMilt inquired of Mr. Barmberry whether the Boltwoods were within, and\nburst into the parlor-living-room-library. As he cried to Claire, by the\nfire, \"Thought I'd never catch up with you,\" he was conscious that\nstanding up, talking to Mr. Boltwood, was an old-young man, very suave,\nvery unfriendly of eye. He had an Oxford-gray suit, unwrinkled cordovan\nshoes; a pert, insultingly well-tied blue bow tie, and a superior narrow\npink bald spot. As he heard Jeff Saxton murmur, \"Ah. Mr. Daggett!\" Milt\nfelt the luxury in the room--the fleecy robe over Claire's shoulders,\nthe silver box of candy by her elbow, the smell of expensive cigars, and\nthe portly complacence of Mr. Boltwood.\n\n\"Have you had any dinner?\" Claire was asking, when a voice boomed, \"Let\nme introduce myself as Westlake Parrott.\"\n\nJeff abruptly took charge. He faced Pinky and demanded, \"I beg pardon!\"\n\nClaire's eyebrows asked questions of Milt.\n\n\"This is a fellow I gave a lift to. Miner--I mean actor--well, kind of\nspiritualistic medium----\"\n\nMr. Boltwood, with the geniality of dinner and cigar, soothed, \"Jeff,\nuh, Daggett here has saved our lives two distinct times, and given us a\ngreat deal of help. He is a motor expert. He has always refused to let\nus do anything in return but---- I noticed there was almost a whole\nfried chicken left. I wonder if he wouldn't share it with, uh, with his\nacquaintance here before--before they make camp for the night?\"\n\nIn civil and vicious tones Jeff began, \"Very glad to reward any one who\nhas been of service to----\"\n\nHe was drowned out by Pinky's effusive, \"True hospitality is a virtue as\ndelicate as it is rare. We accept your invitation. In fact I should be\nglad to have one of those cigarros elegantos that mine olfactory----\"\n\nMilt cut in abruptly, \"Pink! Shut up! Thanks, folks, but we'll go on.\nJust wanted to see if you had got in safe. See you tomorrow, some\nplace.\"\n\nClaire was close to Milt, her fingers on his sleeve. \"Please, Milt!\nFather! You didn't make your introduction very complete. You failed to\ntell Mr. Daggett that this is Mr. Saxton, a friend of ours in Brooklyn.\nPlease, Milt, do stay and have dinner. I won't let you go on hungry. And\nI want you to know Jeff--Mr. Saxton.... Jeff, Mr. Daggett is an\nengineer, that is, in a way. He's going to take an engineering course in\nthe University of Washington. Some day I shall make you bloated copper\nmagnates become interested in him.... Mrs. Barmberry. Mrssssssss.\nBarrrrrrrmberrrrrry! Oh. Oh, Mrs. Barmberry, won't you please warm up\nthat other chicken for----\"\n\n\"Oh, now, that's too bad. Me and Jim have et it all up!\" wept the\nlandlady, at the door.\n\n\"I'll go on,\" stammered Milt.\n\nJeff looked at him expressionlessly.\n\n\"You will not go on!\" Claire was insisting. \"Mrs. Barmberry, won't you\ncook some eggs or steak or something for these boys?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Jeff suggested, \"they'd rather make their own dinner by a\ncampfire. Must be very jolly, and that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Jeff, if you don't mind, this is my party, just for the moment!\"\n\n\"Quite right. Sorry!\"\n\n\"Milt, you sit here by the fire and get warm. I'm not going to be robbed\nof the egotistic pleasure of being hospitable. Everybody look happy\nnow!\"\n\nShe got them all seated--all but Pinky. He had long since seated\nhimself, by the fire, in Claire's chair, and he was smoking a cigar from\nthe box which Jeff had brought for Mr. Boltwood.\n\nMilt sat farthest from the fire, by the dining-table. He was agonizing,\n\"This Jeff person is the real thing. He's no Percy in riding-breeches.\nHe's used to society and nastiness. If he looks at me once more--young\ngarage man found froze stiff, near Flathead Lake, scared look in eyes,\nbelieved to have met a grizzly, no signs of vi'lence. And I thought I\ncould learn to mingle with Claire's own crowd! I wish I was out in the\nbug. I wonder if I can't escape?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE FALLACY OF ROMANCE\n\n\nDuring dinner Milt watched Jeff Saxton's manner and manners. The hot day\nhad turned into a cold night. Jeff tucked the knitted robe about\nClaire's shoulders, when she returned to the fire. He moved quietly and\neasily. He kept poking up the fire, smiling at Claire as he did so. He\nseemed without difficulty to maintain two conversations: one with Mr.\nBoltwood about finances, one with Claire about mysterious persons called\nFannie and Alden and Chub and Bobbie and Dot, the mention of whom made\nMilt realize how much a stranger he was. Once, as he passed by Claire,\nJeff said gently, \"You _are_ lovely!\" Only that, and he did not look at\nher. But Milt saw that Claire flushed, and her eyes dimmed.\n\nPinky was silent till he had eaten about two-thirds of the total amount\nof fried eggs, cold lamb and ice-box curios. When Claire came over to\nsee how they fared, Pinky removed himself, with smirking humility, and\nfirmly joined himself to Jeff and Mr. Boltwood. He caught the subject of\nfinance and, while Claire dropped down in the chair by Milt, Pinky was\nlecturing the two men from New York:\n\n\"Ah, finance! Queen of the sociological pantheon! I don't know how come\nI am so graced by Fortune as to have encountered in these wilds two\ngentlemen so obviously versed in the stratagems of the great golden\ngame, but I will take the opportunity to give you gentlemen some\nstatistics about the gold-deposits still existent in the Cascades and\nother ranges that may be of benefit and certainly will be a surprise to\nyou. It happens that I have at the present time a mine----\"\n\nClaire was whispering to Milt, \"If we can get rid of your dreadful\npassenger, I do want you to meet Mr. Saxton. He may be of use to you\nsome day. He's terribly capable, and really quite nice. Think! He\nhappened to be out here, and he traced me by telephone--oh, he treats\nlong-distance 'phoning as I do a hair-pin. He brought down the duckiest\npresents--divertissements for dinner, and that knitted robe, and some\nreal Ren\u00c3\u00a9 Bleuzet perfume--I was all out of it---- And after the grime\nof the road----\"\n\n\"Do you really care for things like that, all those awfully expensive\nluxuries?\" begged Milt.\n\n\"Of course I do. Especially after small hotels.\"\n\n\"Then you don't really like adventuring?\"\n\n\"Oh yes--in its place! For one thing, it makes a clever dinner seem so\ngood by contrast!\"\n\n\"Well---- Afraid I don't know much about clever dinners,\" Milt was\nsighing, when he was aware of Jeff Saxton looming down on him,\ndemanding:\n\n\"Daggett, would you mind trying to inform your friend that neither Mr.\nBoltwood nor I care to invest in his gold-mine? We can't seem to get\nthat into his head. I don't mind being annoyed myself, but I really feel\nI must protect Mr. Boltwood.\"\n\n\"What can I do?\"\n\n\"My dear sir, since you brought him here----\"\n\nIt was the potassium cyanide and cracked ice and carpet tacks and TNT\nand castor oil in Jeff's \"My dear sir\" that did it. Milt discovered\nhimself on his feet, bawling, \"I am not your dear sir! Pinky is my\nguest, and---- Gee, sorry I lost my temper, Claire, terrible sorry. See\nyou along the road. Good night. Pink! You take your hat! Git!\"\n\nMilt followed Pinky out of the door, snarling, \"Git in the car, and do\nit quick. I'll take you clear to Blewett Pass. We drive all night.\"\n\nPinky was of great silence and tact. Milt lumped into the bug beside\nhim. But he did not start the all-night drive. He wanted to crawl back,\non his knees, to apologize to Claire--and to be slapped by Jeff Saxton.\nHe compromised by slowly driving a quarter of a mile up the road, and\ncamping there for the night.\n\nPinky tried to speak words of philosophy and cheer--just once he tried\nit.\n\nFor hours, by a small fire, Milt grieved that all his pride was gone in\na weak longing to see Claire again. In the morning he did see\nher--putting off on the lake, in a motor-boat with Jeff and Mr.\nBarmberry. He saw the boat return, saw Jeff get into the car which had\nbrought him from Kalispell, saw the farewell, the long handclasp, the\nstoop of Jeff's head, and Claire's quick step backward before Jeff could\nkiss her. But Claire waved to Jeff long after his car had started.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Claire and her father came along in the Gomez, Milt was standing by\nthe road. She stopped. She smiled. \"Night of sadness and regrets? You\nwere fairly rude, Milt. So was Mr. Saxton, but I've lectured him, and he\nsends his apologies.\"\n\n\"I send him mine--'deed I do,\" said Milt gravely.\n\n\"Then everything's all right. I'm sure we were all tired. We'll just\nforget it.\"\n\n\"Morning, Daggett,\" Mr. Boltwood put in. \"Hope you lose that dreadful\nred-headed person.\"\n\n\"No, I can't, Mr. Boltwood. When Mr. Saxton turned on me, I swore I'd\ntake Pinky clear through to Blewett Pass ... though not to Seattle, by\ngolly!\"\n\n\"Foolish oaths should be broken,\" Claire platitudinized.\n\n\"Claire--look---- You don't really care so terribly much about these\nlittle luxuries, food and fixin's and six-dollar-a-day-hotel junk, do\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" stoutly, \"I do.\"\n\n\"But not compared with mountains and----\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all very well to talk, and be so superior about these dear old\ngrandeurs of Nature, and the heroism of pioneers, and I do like a\nglimpse of them. But the niceties of life do mean something and even if\nit is weak and dependent, I shall always simply adore them!\"\n\n\"All these things are kind of softening.\" And he meant that she was\nstill soft.\n\n\"At least they're not rude!\" And she meant that he was rude.\n\n\"They're absolutely trivial. They shut off----\"\n\n\"They shut off rain and snow and dirt, and I still fail to see the\npicturesqueness of dirt! Good-by!\"\n\nShe had driven off, without looking back. She was heading for Seattle\nand the Pacific Ocean at forty miles an hour--and they had no engagement\nto meet either in Seattle or in the Pacific.\n\nBefore Milt went on he completed a task on which he had decided the\nnight before while he had meditated on the tailored impertinence of Jeff\nSaxton's gray suit. The task was to give away the Best Suit, that\nstolid, very black covering which at Schoenstrom had seemed suitable\neither to a dance or to the Y. P. S. C. E. The recipient was Mr. Pinky\nParrott, who gave in return a history of charity and high souls.\n\nMilt did not listen. He was wondering, now that they had started, where\nthey had started for. Certainly not for Seattle! Why not stop and see\nPinky's gold-mine? Maybe he did have one. Even Pinky had to tell the\ntruth sometimes. With a good popular gold-mine in his possession, Milt\ncould buy quantities of clothes like Jeff Saxton's, and----\n\n\"And,\" he reflected, \"I can learn as good manners as his in one hour,\nwith a dancing lesson thrown in. If I didn't, I'd sue the professor!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE NIGHT OF ENDLESS PINES\n\n\nOn the edge of Kootenai Canyon, feeling more like an aviator than like\nan automobilist, Claire had driven, and now, nearing Idaho, she had\nentered a national forest. She was delayed for hours, while she tried to\nchange a casing, after a blow-out when the spare tire was deflated. She\nwished for Milt. She would never see him again. She was sorry. He hadn't\nmeant----\n\nBut hang it, she panted, if he admired her at all, he'd be here now and\nget on this per-fect-ly beast-ly casing, over which she had been\nlaboring for a dozen years; and she was simply too ridiculously tired;\nand was there any respectful way of keeping Henry B. from beaming in\nthat benevolent manner while she was killing herself; and look at those\nfingernails; and--oh, drrrrrrat that casing!\n\nTo make the next town, after this delay, she had to drive for hours by\nnight through the hulking pines of the national forest. It was her first\nlong night drive.\n\nA few claims, with log cabins of recent settlers, once or twice the\nshack of a forest-ranger, a telephone in a box by the road or a rough R.\nF. D. box nailed to a pine trunk, these indicated that civilization\nstill existed, but they were only melancholy blurs. She was in a cold\nenchantment. All of her was dead save the ability to keep on driving,\nforever, with no hope of the tedium ending. She was bewildered. She\npassed six times what seemed to be precisely the same forest clearing,\nalways with the road on a tiny ridge to the left of the clearing, always\nwith a darkness-stilled house at one end and always, in the pasture at\nthe other end, a horse which neighed. She was in a panorama stage-scene;\nthings moved steadily by her, there was a sound of the engine, and a\nsensation of steering, but she was forever in the same place, among the\nsame pines, with the same scowling blackness between their bare clean\ntrunks. Only the road ahead was clear: a one-way track, the foot-high\nearthy bank and the pine-roots beside it, two distinct ruts, and a\nroughening of strewn brown bark and pine-needles, which, in the beating\nlight of the car's lamps, made the sandy road scabrous with little\nincessant shadows.\n\nShe had never known anything save this strained driving on. Jeff and\nMilt were old tales, and untrue. Was it ten hours before that she had\ncooked dinner beside the road? No matter. She wasn't hungry any longer.\nShe would never reach the next town--and she didn't care. It wasn't she,\nbut a grim spirit which had entered her dead body, that kept steering,\nfeeding gas, watching the road.\n\nIn the darkness outside the funnel of light from her lamps were shadows\nthat leaped, and gray hands hastily jerked back out of sight behind tree\ntrunks as she came up; things that followed her, and hidden men waiting\nfor her to stop.\n\nAs drivers will, she tried to exorcise the creeping fear by singing. She\nmade up what she called her driving-song. It was intended to echo the\nhoofs of a fat old horse on a hard road:\n\n    The old horse trots with a jog, jog, jog,\n    And a jog, jog, jog; and a jog, jog, jog.\n    And the old road makes a little jog, jog, jog,\n    To the west, jog, jog; and the north, jog, jog.\n    While the farmer drinks some cider from his jug, jug, jug,\n    From his coy jug, jug; from his joy jug, jug.\n    Till he accumulates a little jag, jag, jag,\n    And he jigs, jigs, jigs, with his jug, jug, jug----\n\nThe song was a comfort, at first--then a torment. She drove to it, and\nshe steered to it, and when she tried to forget, it sang itself in her\ntired brain: \"Jog, jog, jog--oh, _damn_!\"\n\nHer father had had a chill. Miserable, weak as a small boy, he had\ncurled up on the bottom of the car, his head on the seat, and gone to\nsleep. She was alone. The mile-posts went by slowly. The posts said\nthere was a town ahead called Pellago, but it never came----\n\nAnd when it did come she was too tired to care. In a thick dream she\ndrove through midnight streets of the town. In stupid paralysis she\nkicked at the door of the galvanized-iron-covered garage. No answer. She\ngave it up. She drove down the street and into the yard of a hotel\nmarked by a swing sign out over the plank sidewalk. She got out the\ntraveling bags, awakened her father, led him up on the porch.\n\nThe Pellago Tavern was a transformed dwelling house. The pillars of the\nporch were aslant, and the rain-warped boards snapped beneath her feet.\nShe hesitatingly opened the door. The hallway was dark and musty. A\nsound like a moan filtered down the unlighted stairs.\n\nThere seemed to be light in the room on the right. Trying to assure\nherself that her father was a protection, she pushed open the door. She\nlooked into an airless room, scattered with rubber boots, unsavory old\ncorduroy caps, tattered magazines. By the stove nodded a wry-mouthed,\nsquat old woman, and a tall, cheaply handsome man of forty. Tobacco\njuice stained the front of his stiff-bosomed, collarless shirt. His\nhands were white but huge.\n\nThe old woman started. \"Well?\"\n\n\"I want to get two rooms for the night, please.\"\n\nThe man smirked at her. The woman creaked, \"Well, I don't know. Where d'\nyou come from, heh?\"\n\n\"We're motoring through.\"\n\n\"Heh? Who's that man?\"\n\n\"He's my father, madam.\"\n\n\"Needn't to be so hoity-toity about it, 'he's my father, madam!' F' that\nmatter, that thing there is my husband!\"\n\nThe man had been dusting his shabby coat, stroking his mustache, smiling\nwith sickly gallantry. He burbled, \"Shut up, Teenie. This lady is all\nright. Give her a room. Number 2 is empty, and I guess Number 7 has been\nmade up since Bill left--if 'tain't, the sheets ain't been slept on but\none night.\"\n\n\"Where d' you come----\"\n\n\"Now don't go shooting off a lot of questions at the lady, Teenie. I'll\nshow her the rooms.\"\n\nThe woman turned on her husband. He was perhaps twenty-five years\nyounger; a quarter-century less soaked in hideousness. Her yellow,\nconcave-sided teeth were bared at him, her mouth drew up on one side\nabove the gums. \"Pete, if I hear one word more out of you, out you go.\nLady! Huh! Where d' you come from, young woman?\"\n\nClaire was too weak to stagger away. She leaned against the door. Her\nfather struggled to speak, but the woman hurled:\n\n\"Wherdjuhcomfromised!\"\n\n\"From New York. Is there another hotel----\"\n\n\"Nah, there ain't another hotel! Oh! So you come from New York, do you?\nSnobs, that's what N' Yorkers are. I'll show you some rooms. They'll be\ntwo dollars apiece, and breakfast fifty cents extra.\"\n\nThe woman led them upstairs. Claire wanted to flee, but---- Oh, she\ncouldn't drive any farther! She couldn't!\n\nThe floor of her room was the more bare in contrast to a two-foot-square\nsplash of gritty ingrain carpet in front of the sway-backed bed. On the\nbed was a red comforter that was filthy beyond disguise. The yellow\nearthenware pitcher was cracked. The wall mirror was milky. Claire had\nbeen spoiled. She had found two excellent hotels since Yellowstone Park.\nShe had forgotten how badly human beings can live. She protested:\n\n\"Seems to me two dollars is a good deal to charge for this!\"\n\n\"I didn't say two dollars. I said three! Three each for you and your pa.\nIf you don't like it you can drive on to the next town. It's only\nsixteen miles!\"\n\n\"Why the extra dollar--or extra two dollars?\"\n\n\"Don't you see that carpet? These is our best rooms. And three\ndollars---- I know you New Yorkers. I heard of a gent once, and they\ncharged him five dollars--five dol-lars!--for a room in New York, and a\nboy grabbed his valise from him and wanted a short-bit and----\"\n\n\"Oh--all--right! Can we get something to eat?\"\n\n\"Now!?\"\n\n\"We haven't eaten since noon.\"\n\n\"That ain't my fault! Some folks can go gadding around in automobuls,\nand some folks has to stay at home. If you think I'm going to sit up all\nnight cooking for people that come chassayin' in here God knows what all\nhours of the day and night----! There's an all-night lunch down the\nstreet.\"\n\nWhen she was alone Claire cried a good deal.\n\nHer father declined to go out to the lunch room. The chill of the late\nride was still on him, he croaked through his door; he was shivering; he\nwas going right to bed.\n\n\"Yes, do, dear. I'll bring you back a sandwich.\"\n\n\"Safe to go out alone?\"\n\n\"Anything's safe after facing that horrible---- I do believe in witches,\nnow. Listen, dear; I'll bring you a hot-water bag.\"\n\nShe took the bag down to the office. The landlady was winding the clock,\nwhile her husband yawned. She glared.\n\n\"I wonder if I may have some hot water for my father? He has a chill.\"\n\n\"Stove's out. No hot water in the house.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you heat some?\"\n\n\"Now look here, miss. You come in here, asking for meals and rooms at\nmidnight, and you want a cut rate on everything, and I do what I can,\nbut enough's enough!\"\n\nThe woman stalked out. Her husband popped up. \"Mustn't mind the old\ngirl, lady. Got a grouch. Well, you can't blame her, in a way; when Bill\nlit out, he done her out of four-bits! But I'll tell you!\" he leered.\n\"You leave me the hot-water biznai, and I'll heat you some water\nmyself!\"\n\n\"Thank you, but I won't trouble you. Good night.\"\n\nClaire was surprised to find a warm, rather comfortable all-night lunch\nroom, called the Alaska Caf\u00c3\u00a9, with a bright-eyed man of twenty-five in\ncharge. He nodded in a friendly way, and made haste with her order of\ntwo ham-and-egg sandwiches. She felt adventurous. She polished her knife\nand fork on a napkin, as she had seen people do in lunches along the\nway. A crowd of three rubbed their noses against the front window to\nstare at the strange girl in town, but she ignored them, and they\ndrifted away.\n\nThe lunchman was cordial: \"At a hotel, ma'am? Which one? Gee, not the\nTavern?\"\n\n\"Why yes. Is there another?\"\n\n\"Sure. First-rate one, two blocks over, one up.\"\n\n\"The woman said the Tavern was the only hotel.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's an old sour-face. Don't mind her. Just bawl her out. What's\nshe charging you for a room?\"\n\n\"Three dollars.\"\n\n\"Per each? Gee! Well, she sticks tourists anywheres from one buck to\nthree. Natives get by for fifty cents. She's pretty fierce, but she\nain't a patch on her husband. He comes from Spokane--nobody knows\nwhy--guess he was run out. He takes some kind of dope, and he cheats at\nrummy.\"\n\n\"But why does the town stand either of them? Why do you let them torture\ninnocent people? Why don't you put them in the insane hospital, where\nthey belong?\"\n\n\"That's a good one!\" her friend chuckled. But he saw it only as a joke.\n\nShe thought of moving her father to the good hotel, but she hadn't the\nstrength.\n\nClaire Boltwood, of Brooklyn Heights, went through the shanty streets of\nPellago, Montana, at one A.M. carrying a sandwich in a paper bag which\nhad recently been used for salted peanuts, and a red rubber hot-water\nbag filled with water at the Alaska Caf\u00c3\u00a9. At the Tavern she hastened\npast the office door. She made her father eat his sandwich; she teased\nhim and laughed at him till the hot-water bag had relieved his\nchill-pinched back; she kissed him boisterously, and started for her own\nroom, at the far end of the hall.\n\nThe lights were off. She had to feel her way, and she hesitated at the\ndoor of her room before she entered. She imagined voices, creeping\nfootsteps, people watching her from a distance. She flung into the\nroom, and when the kindled lamp showed her familiar traveling bag, she\nfelt safer. But once she was in bed, with the sheet down as far as\npossible over the loathly red comforter, the quiet rustled and snapped\nabout her, and she could not relax. Sinking into sleep seemed slipping\ninto danger, and a dozen times she started awake.\n\nBut only slowly did she admit to herself that she actually did hear a\nfumbling, hear the knob of her door turning.\n\n\"W-who's there?\"\n\n\"It's me, lady. The landlord. Brought you the hot water.\"\n\n\"Thanks so much, but I don't need it now.\"\n\n\"Got something else for you. Come to the door. Don't want to holler and\nwake ev'body up.\"\n\nAt the door she said timorously, \"Nothing else I want, thank you.\nD-don't bother me.\"\n\n\"Why, I've brought you up a sandwich, girlie, all nice and hot, and a\nnip of something to take the chill off.\"\n\n\"I don't want it, I tell you!\"\n\n\"Be a sport now! You use Pete right, and he'll use you right. Shame to\nsee a lady like you not gettin' no service here. Open the door. Dandy\nsandwich!\" The knob rattled again. She said nothing. The heel of her\npalm pressed against the door till the molding ate into it. The man was\nsnorting:\n\n\"I ain't going to all this trouble and then throw away a good sandwich.\nYou asked me----\"\n\n\"M-must I s-shout?\"\n\n\"S-shout your fool head off!\" He kicked the door. \"Good friends of mine,\n'long this end of the hall. Aw, listen. Just teasing. I'm not going to\nrob you, little honey bird. Laws, you could have a million dollars, and\nold Pete wouldn't take two-bits. I just get so darn lonely in this hick\ntown. Like to chat to live ones from the big burg. I'm a city fella\nmyself--Spokane and Cheyenne and everything.\"\n\nIn her bare feet, Claire had run across the room, looked desperately out\nof the window. Could she climb out, reach her friend of the Alaska Caf\u00c3\u00a9?\nIf she had to----\n\nThen she grinned. The world was rose-colored and hung with tinkling\nbells. \"I love even that Pinky person!\" she said. In the yard of the\nhotel, beside her Gomez, was a Teal bug, and two men were sleeping in\nblankets on the ground.\n\nShe marched over to the door. She flung it open. The man started back.\nHe was holding an electric, torch. She could not see him, but to the\nhovering ball of light she remarked, \"Two men, friends of mine, are\nbelow, by their car. You will go at once, or I'll call them. If you\nthink I am bluffing, go down and look. Good night!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE FREE WOMAN\n\n\nBefore breakfast, Claire darted down to the hotel yard. She beamed at\nMilt, who was lacing a rawhide patch on a tire, before she remembered\nthat they were not on speaking terms. They both looked extremely\nsheepish and young. It was Pinky Parrott who was the social lubricant.\nPinky was always on speaking terms with everybody. \"Ah, here she is! The\nlittle lady of the mutinous eyes! Our colonel of the flivver hussars!\"\n\nBut he got no credit. Milt straightened up and lumbered, \"Hel-lo!\"\n\nShe peeped at him and whispered, \"Hel-lo!\"\n\n\"Say, oh please, Claire---- I didn't mean----\"\n\n\"Oh, I know! Let's--let's go have breakfast.\"\n\n\"Was awfully afraid you'd think we were fresh, but when we came in last\nnight, and saw your car--didn't like the looks of the hotel much, and\nthought we'd stick around.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad. Oh, Milt--yes, and you, Mr. Parrott--will you\nwhip--lick--beat up--however you want to say it--somebody for me?\"\n\nWith one glad communal smile Milt and Pinky curved up their wrists and\nmade motions as of pulling up their sleeves.\n\n\"But not unless I say so. I want to be a Citizeness Fixit. I've been\ngood for so long. But now----\"\n\n\"Show him to me!\" and \"Up, lads, and atum!\" responded her squad.\n\n\"Not till after breakfast.\"\n\nIt was a sufficiently vile breakfast, at the Tavern. The feature was\ncurious cakes whose interior was raw creepy dough. A dozen skilled\nworkmen were at the same long table with Claire, Milt, Pinky, and Mr.\nBoltwood--the last two of whom were polite and scenically descriptive to\neach other, but portentously silent about gold-mines. The landlady and a\nslavey waited on table; the landlord could be seen loafing in the\nkitchen.\n\nToward the end of the meal Claire insultingly crooked her finger at the\nlandlady and said, \"Come here, woman.\"\n\nThe landlady stared, then ignored her.\n\n\"Very well. Then I'll say it publicly!\" Claire swept the workmen with an\naffectionate smile. \"Gentlemen of Pellago, I want you to know from one\nof the poor tourists who have been cheated at this nasty place that we\ndepend on you to do something. This woman and her husband are criminals,\nin the way they overcharge for hideous food and----\"\n\nThe landlady had been petrified. Now she charged down. Behind her came\nher husband. Milt arose. The husband stopped. But it was Pinky who faced\nthe landlady, tapped her shoulder, and launched into, \"And what's more,\nyou hag, if our new friends here have any sense, they'll run you out of\ntown.\"\n\nThat was only the beginning of Pinky's paper on corrections and\ncharities. He enjoyed himself. Before he finished, the landlady was\ncrying ... she voluntarily promised to give her boarders waffles, some\nmorning, jus' soon as she could find the waffle-iron.\n\nWith her guard about her, at the office desk, Claire paid one dollar\napiece for the rooms, and discussion was not.\n\nBefore they started, Milt had the chance to say to her, \"I'm getting so\nI can handle Pinky now. Have to. Thinking of getting hold of his\ngold-mine. I just give him the eye, as your friend Mr. Saxton would, and\nhe gets so meek----\"\n\n\"But don't! Please understand me, Milt; I do admire Mr. Saxton; he is\nfine and capable, and really generous; only---- He may be just a bit\nsnippish at times, while you--you're a playmate--father's and\nmine--and---- I did face that landlady, didn't I! I'm not soft and\ntrivial, am I! Praise!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe had driven through the panhandle of Idaho into Washington, through\nSpokane, through the writhing lava deposits of Moses Coulee where fruit\ntrees grow on volcanic ash. Beyond Wenatchee, with its rows of apple\ntrees striping the climbing fields like corduroy in folds, she had come\nto the famous climb of Blewett Pass. Once over that pass, and\nSnoqualmie, she would romp into Seattle.\n\nShe was sorry that she hadn't come to know Milt better, but perhaps she\nwould see him in Seattle.\n\nNot adventure alone was she finding, but high intellectual benefit in\nstudying the names of towns in the state of Washington. Not Kankakee nor\nKalamazoo nor Oshkosh can rival the picturesque fancy of Washington, and\nClaire combined the town-names in a lyric so emotion-stirring that it\nought, perhaps, to be the national anthem. It ran:\n\n    Humptulips, Tum Tum, Moclips, Yelm,\n    Satsop, Bucoda, Omak, Enumclaw,\n    Tillicum, Bossburg, Chettlo, Chattaroy,\n    Zillah, Selah, Cowiche, Keechelus,\n    Bluestem, Bluelight, Onion Creek, Sockeye,\n    Antwine, Chopaka, Startup, Kapowsin,\n      Skamokawa, Sixprong, Pysht!\n\n    Klickitat, Kittitas, Spangle, Cedonia,\n    Pe Ell, Cle Elum, Sallal, Chimacum,\n    Index, Taholah, Synarep, Puyallup,\n    Wallula, Wawawai, Wauconda, Washougal,\n    Walla Walla, Washtucna, Wahluke,\n    Solkulk, Newaukum, Wahkiakus,\n      Penawawa, Ohop, Ladd!\n\n    Harrah, Olalla, Umtanum, Chuckanut,\n    Soap Lake, Loon Lake, Addy, Ace, Usk,\n    Chillowist, Moxee City, Yellepit, Cashup,\n    Moonax, Mabton, Tolt, Mukilteo,\n    Poulsbo, Toppenish, Whetstone, Inchelium,\n    Fishtrap, Carnation, Shine, Monte Cristo,\n      Conconully, Roza, Maud!\n\n    China Bend, Zumwalt, Sapolil, Riffle,\n    Touchet, Chesaw, Chew, Klum, Bly,\n    Humorist, Hammer, Nooksack, Oso,\n    Samamish, Dusty, Tiger, Turk, Dot,\n    Scenic, Tekoa, Nellita, Attalia,\n    Steilacoom, Tweedle, Ruff, Lisabeula,\n    Latah, Peola, Towal, Eltopia,\n      Steptoe, Pluvius, Sol Duc, Twisp!\n\n\"And then,\" complained Claire, \"they talk about Amy Lowell! I leave it\nto you, Henry B., if any union poet has ever written as gay a refrain as\n'Ohop Ladd'!\"\n\nShe was not merely playing mental whist. She was trying to keep from\nworry. All the way she had heard of Blewett Pass; its fourteen miles of\nclimbing, and the last half mile of stern pitch. On this eastern side of\nthe pass, the new road was not open; there was a tortuous,\nflint-scattered trail, too narrow, in most places, for the passing of\nother cars. Claire was glad that Milt and Pinky were near her.\n\nIf so many of the race of kind advisers of tourists had not warned her\nabout it, doubtless she would have gone over the pass without\ndifficulty. But their voluntary croaking sapped her nerve, and her\nfather's. He kept worrying, \"Do you think we better try it?\" When they\nstopped at a ranch house at the foot of the climb, for the night, he\nseemed unusually tired. He complained of chill. He did not eat\nbreakfast. They started out silent, depressed.\n\nHe crouched in the corner of the seat. She looked at him and was\nanxious. She stopped on the first level space on the pass, crying, \"You\nare perfectly miserable. I'm afraid of---- I think we ought to see a\ndoctor.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll be all right.\"\n\nBut she waited till Milt came pit-pattering up the slope. \"Father feels\nrather sick. What shall I do? Turn round and drive to the nearest\ndoctor--at Cashmere, I suppose?\"\n\n\"There's a magnolious medico ahead here on the pass,\" Pinky Parrott\ninterrupted. \"A young thing, but they say he's a graduate of Harvard.\nHe's out here because he has some timber-claims. Look, Milt o' the\nDaggett, why don't you drive Miss Boltwood's 'bus--make better time, and\nhustle the old gent up to the doc, and I'll come on behind with your\nmachine.\"\n\n\"Why,\" Claire fretted, \"I hate----\"\n\nA new Milt, the boss, abrupt, almost bullying, snapped out of his bug.\n\"Good idee. Jump in, Claire. I'll take your father up. Heh, whasat,\nPink? Yes, I get it; second turn beyond grocery. Right. On we go. Huh?\nOh, we'll think about the gold-mine later, Pink.\"\n\nWith the three of them wedged into the seat of the Gomez, and Pinky\nrecklessly skittering after them in the bug, they climbed again--and lo!\nthere was no climb! Unconsciously Claire had hesitated before dashing at\neach sharp upsloping bend; had lost headway while she was wondering,\n\"Suppose the car went off this curve?\" Milt never sped up, but he never\nslackened. His driving was as rhythmical as music.\n\nThey were so packed in that he could scarcely reach gear lever and\nhand-brake. He halted on a level, and curtly asked, \"That trap-door in\nthe back of the car--convertible extra seat?\"\n\n\"Yes, but we almost never use it, and it's stuck. Can't get it open.\"\n\n\"I'll open it all right! Got a big screwdriver? Want you sit back there.\nNeed elbow room.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I'd better drive with Mr. Pinky.\"\n\n\"Nope. Don't think better.\"\n\nWith one yank he opened the trap-door, revealing a folding seat, which\nshe meekly took. Back there, she reflected, \"How strong his back looks.\nFunny how the little silvery hairs grow at the back of his neck.\"\n\nThey came to a settlement and the red cedar bungalow of Dr. Hooker\nBeach. The moment Claire saw the doctor's thin demanding face, she\ntrusted him. He spoke to Mr. Boltwood with assurance: \"All you need is\nsome rest, and your digestion is a little shaky. Been eating some pork?\nMight stay here a day or two. We're glad to have a glimpse of\nEasterners.\"\n\nMr. Boltwood went to bed in the Beaches' guest-room. Mrs. Beach gave\nClaire and Milt lunch, with thin toast and thin china, on a porch from\nwhich an arroyo dropped down for a hundred feet. Fir trees scented the\nair, and a talking machine played the same Russian music that was\npopular that same moment in New York. And the Beaches knew people who\nknew Claire.\n\nClaire was thinking. These people were genuine aristocrats, while Jeff\nSaxton, for all his family and his assumptions about life, was the\neternal climber. Milt, who had been uncomfortable with Jeff, was serene\nand un-self-conscious with the Beaches, and the doctor gratefully took\nhis advice about his stationary gas engine. \"He's rather like the\nBeaches in his simplicity--yes, and his ability to do anything if he\nconsiders it worth while,\" she decided.\n\nAfter lunch, when the doctor and his wife had to trot off to a patient,\nClaire proposed, \"Let's walk up to that ledge of rock and see the view,\nshall we, Milt?\"\n\n\"Yes! And keep an eye on the road for Pinky. The poor nut, he hasn't\nshowed up. So reckless; hope he hasn't driven the Teal off the road.\"\n\nShe crouched at the edge of a rock, where she would have been\nfrightened, a month before, and looked across the main road to a creek\nin a pine-laced gully. He sat beside her, elbows on knees.\n\n\"Those Beaches--their kin are judges and senators and college\nPresidents, all over New England,\" she said. \"This doctor must be the\ngrandson of the ambassador, I fancy.\"\n\n\"Honest? I thought they were just regular folks. Was I nice?\"\n\n\"Of course you were.\"\n\n\"Did I--did I wash my paws and sit up and beg?\"\n\n\"No, you aren't a little dog. I'm that. You're the big mastiff that\nguards the house, while I run and yip.\" She was turned toward him,\nsmiling. Her hand was beside him. He touched the back of it with his\nforefinger, as though he was afraid he might soil it.\n\nThere seemed to be no reason, but he was trembling as he stammered,\n\"I--I--I'm d-darn glad I didn't know they were anybody, or 'd have been\nas bad as a flivver driver the first time he tries a t-twelve-cylinder\nmachine. G-gee your hand is little!\"\n\nShe took it back and inspected it. \"I suppose it is. And pretty\nuseless.\"\n\n\"N-no, it isn't, but your shoes are. Why don't you wear boots when\nyou're out like this?\" A flicker of his earlier peremptoriness came into\nhis voice. She resented it:\n\n\"My shoes are perfectly sensible! I will not wear those horrible\nvegetarian uplift sacks on my feet!\"\n\n\"Your shoes may be all right for New York, but you're not going to New\nYork for a while. You've simply got to see some of this country while\nyou're out here--British Columbia and Alaska.\"\n\n\"Would be nice, but I've had enough roughing----\"\n\n\"Chance to see the grandest mountains in the world, almost, and then you\nwant to go back to tea and all that junk!\"\n\n\"Stop trying to bully me! You have been dictatorial ever since we\nstarted up----\"\n\n\"Have I? Didn't mean to be. Though I suppose I usually am bullying. At\nleast I run things. There's two kinds of people; those that give orders,\nand those that naturally take them; and I belong to the first one,\nand----\"\n\n\"But my dear Milt, so do I, and really----\"\n\n\"And mostly I'd take them from you. But hang it, Seattle is just a day\naway, and you'll forget me. Wish I could kidnap you. Have half a mind\nto. Take you way up into the mountains, and when you got used to\nroughing it in sure-enough wilderness--say you'd helped me haul timber\nfor a flume--then we'd be real pals. You have the stuff in you, but you\nstill need toughening before----\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Milton. You have been reading fiction, about this\nman--sometimes he's a lumberjack, and sometimes a trapper or a miner,\nbut always he's frightfully hairy--and he sees a charming woman in the\ncity, and kidnaps her, and shuts her up in some unspeakable shanty, and\nmakes her eat nice cold boiled potatoes, and so naturally, she simply\nadores him! A hundred men have written that story, and it's an example\nof their insane masculine conceit, which I, as a woman, resent.\nShakespeare may have started it, with his silly _Taming of the Shrew_.\nShakespeare's men may have been real, but his women were dolls, designed\nto please some majesty. You may not know it, but there are women today\nwho don't live just to please majesties' fancies. If a woman like me\nwere kidnapped, she would go on hating the brute, or if she did give in,\nthen the man would lose anyway, because she would have degenerated;\nshe'd have turned into a slave, and lost exactly the things he'd liked\nin her. Oh, you cavemen! With your belief that you can force women to\nlike you! I have more courage than any of you!\"\n\n\"I admit you have courage, but you'd have still more, if you bucked the\nwilds.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! In New York I face every day a hundred complicated problems\nyou don't know I ever heard of!\"\n\n\"Let me remind you that Brer Julius C\u00c3\u00a6sar said he'd rather be mayor in a\nlittle Spanish town than police commissioner in Rome. I'm king in\nSchoenstrom, while you're just one of a couple hundred thousand bright\npeople in New York----\"\n\n\"Really? Oh, at least a million. Thanks!\"\n\n\"Oh--gee--Claire, I didn't mean to be personal, and get in a row and\nall, but--can't you see--kind of desperate--Seattle so soon----\"\n\nHer face was turned from him; its thin profile was firm as silver wire.\nHe blundered off into silence and--they were at it again!\n\n\"I didn't mean to make you angry,\" he gulped.\n\n\"Well, you did! Bullying---- You and your men of granite, in mackinaws\nand a much-needed shave, trying to make a well-bred woman satisfied with\na view consisting of rocks and stumps and socks on the line! Let me tell\nyou that compared with a street canyon, a mountain canyon is simply\ndead, and yet these unlettered wild men----\"\n\n\"See here! I don't know if you're firing these adjectives at me, but I\ndon't know that I'm so much more unlettered---- You talked about taking\nFrench in your finishing-school. Well, they taught American in mine!\"\n\n\"They would!\"\n\nThen he was angry. \"Yes, and chemistry and physics and Greek and Latin\nand history and mathematics and economics, and I took more or less of a\nwhirl at all of them, while you were fiddling with ribbons, and then I\nhad to buck mechanics and business methods.\"\n\n\"I also 'fiddled' with manners--an unfortunate omission in your\ncurriculum, I take it! You have been reasonably rude----\"\n\n\"So have you!\"\n\n\"I had to be! But I trust you begin to see that even your strong hand\ncouldn't control a woman's taste. Kidnapping! As intelligent a boy as\nyou wanting to imitate these boorish movie----\"\n\n\"Not a darn bit more boorish than your smart set, with its champagne and\nthese orgies at country clubs----\"\n\n\"You know so much about country clubs, don't you! The worst orgy I ever\nsaw at one was the golf champion reading the beauty department in\n_Boudoir_. Would you mind backing up your statements about the vices of\nmyself and my friends----\"\n\n\"Oh, you. Oh, I didn't mean----\"\n\n\"Then why did you----\"\n\n\"Now you're bullying me, and you know that if the smart set isn't\nvicious, at least it's so snobbish that it can't see any----\"\n\n\"Then it's wise to be snobbish, because if it did condescend----\"\n\n\"I won't stand people talking about condescending----\"\n\n\"Would you mind not shouting so?\"\n\n\"Very well! I'll keep still!\"\n\nSilence again, while both of them looked unhappy, and tried to remember\njust what they had been fighting about. They did not at first notice a\nsmall red car larruping gaily over the road beneath the ledge, though\nthe driver was a pink-haired man in a green coat. He was almost gone\nbefore Milt choked, \"It's Pinky!\"\n\n\"Pink! Pinky!\" he bellowed.\n\nPinky looked back but, instead of stopping, he sped up, and kept going.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE MINE OF LOST SOULS\n\n\n\"That couldn't have been Pinky! Why! Why, the car he had was red,\" cried\nClaire.\n\n\"Sure. The idiot's got hold of some barn paint somewhere, and tried to\ndaub it over. He's trying to make a getaway with it!\"\n\n\"We'll chase him. In my car.\"\n\n\"Don't you mind?\"\n\n\"Of course not. I do not give up my objections to the roughing\nphilosophy, but---- You were right about these shoes---- Oh, don't leave\nme behind! Want to go along!\"\n\nThese sentences she broke, scattered, and totally lost as she scrambled\nafter him, down the rocks. He halted. His lips trembled. He picked her\nup, carried her down, hesitated a second while his face--curiously\nforeshortened as she looked up at it from his big arms--twisted with\nemotion. He set her down gently, and she climbed into the Gomez.\n\nIt seemed to her that he drove rather too carefully, too slowly. He took\ncurves and corners evenly. His face was as empty of expression, as\nunmelodramatic, as that of a jitney driver. Then she looked at the\nspeedometer. He was making forty-eight miles an hour down hill and forty\nto thirty on upgrades.\n\nThey were in sight of the fleeing Pinky in two miles. Pinky looked back;\ninstantly was to be seen pulling his hat low, stooping over--the demon\ndriver. Milt merely sat more erect, looked more bland and white-browed\nand steady.\n\nThe bug fled before them on a winding shelf road. It popped up a curve,\nthen slowed down. \"He took it too fast. Poor Pink!\" said Milt.\n\nThey gained on that upslope, but as the road dropped, the bug started\nforward desperately. Another car was headed toward them; was drawn to\nthe side of the road, in one of the occasional widenings. Pinky passed\nit so carelessly that, with crawling spine, Claire saw the outer wheels\nof the bug on the very edge of the road--the edge of a fifty-foot drop.\nMilt went easily past the halted car--even waved his hand to the waiting\ndriver.\n\nThis did not seem to Claire at all like the chase of a thief. She looked\ncasually ahead at Pinky, as he whirled round an S-shaped curve on the\ndownslope, then---- It was too quick to see what happened. The bug\nheaded directly toward the edge of the road, shot out, went down the\nembankment, over and over. It lay absurdly upside-down, its muffler and\nbrake-rods showing in place of the seat and hood.\n\nMilt quite carefully stopped the Gomez. The day was still--just a\nbreathing of running water in the deep gully. The topsy-turvy car below\nthem was equally still; no sight of Pinky, no sound.\n\nThe gauche boy gone from him, Milt took her hand, pressed it to his\ncheek. \"Claire! You're here! You might have gone with him, to make\nroom---- Oh, I was bullying you because I was bullying myself! Trying to\nmake myself tell you--but oh, you know, you know! Can you stand going\ndown there? I hate to have you, but you may be needed.\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll come,\" she whispered.\n\nTheir crawl down the rock-rolling embankment seemed desperately slow.\n\n\"Wait here,\" bade Milt, at the bottom.\n\nShe looked away from the grotesque car. She had seen that one side of it\nwas crumpled like paper in an impatient hand.\n\nMilt was stooping, looking under; seemed to be saying something. When he\ncame back, he did not speak. He wiped his forehead. \"Come. We'll climb\nback up. Nothing to do, now. Guess you better not try to help, anyway.\nYou might not sleep well.\"\n\nHe gave her his hand up the embankment, drove to the nearest house,\ntelephoned to Dr. Beach. Later she waited while Milt and the doctor,\nwith two other men, were raising the car. As she waited she thought of\nthe Teal bug as a human thing--as her old friend, to which she had often\nturned in need.\n\nMilt returned to her. \"There is one thing for you to do. Before he died,\nPinky asked me to go get his wife--Dolores, I think it is. She's up in a\nside canyon, few miles away. She may want a woman around. Beach will\ntake care of--of him. Can you come?\"\n\n\"Of course. Oh, Milt, I didn't----\"\n\n\"I didn't----\"\n\n\"--mean you were a caveman! You're my big brother!\"\n\n\"--mean you were a snob!\"\n\nThey drove five miles along the highway, then up a trail where the Gomez\nbrushed the undergrowth on each side as it desperately dug into moss,\nrain-gutted ruts, loose rocks, all on a vicious slant which seemed to\npush the car down again. Beside them, the mountain woods were sacredly\nquiet, with fern and lily and green-lit spaces. They came out in a\nclearing, before dusk. Beside the clearing was a brook, with a crude\ncradle--sign of a not very successful gold miner. Before a log cabin, in\na sway-sided rocker, creaked a tall, white, flabby woman, once nearly\nbeautiful, now rubbed at the edges. She rose, huddling her wrapper about\nher bosom, as they drove into the clearing and picked their way through\nstumps and briars.\n\n\"Where you folks think you're going?\" she whimpered.\n\n\"Why, why just----\"\n\n\"I cer'nly am glad to see somebody! I been 'most scared to death. Been\nhere alone two weeks now. Got a shotgun, but if anybody come, I guess\nthey'd take it away from me. I was brought up nice, no rough-house\nor---- Say, did you folks come to see the gold-mine?\"\n\n\"M-mine?\" babbled Milt.\n\n\"Course not. Pinky said I was to show it, but I'm so sore on that\nlow-life hound now, I swear I won't even take the trouble and lie about\nit. No more gold in that crick than there is in my eye. Or than there's\nflour or pork in the house!\"\n\nThe woman's voice was rising. Her gestures were furious. Claire and Milt\nstood close, their hands slipping together.\n\n\"What d' you think of a man that'd go off and leave a lady without half\nenough to eat, while he gallivanted around, trying to raise money by\ngambling, when he was offered a good job up here? He's a gambler--told\nme he was a rich mine-owner, but never touched a mine in his life. Lying\nhound--worst talker in ten counties! Got a gambler's hand on him, too--I\nought to seen it! Oh, wait till I get hold of him; just wait!\"\n\nClaire thought of the still hand--so still--that she had seen under the\nedge of the upturned car. She tried to speak, while the woman raved on,\nwrath feeding wrath:\n\n\"Thank God, I ain't really his wife! My husband is a fine man--Mr.\nKloh--Dlorus Kloh, my name is. Mr. Kloh's got a fine job with the mill,\nat North Yakima. Oh, I was a fool! This gambler Pinky Parrott, he comes\nalong with his elegant ways, and he hands me out a swell line of gab,\nand I ups and leaves poor Kloh, and the kid, and the nicest kid---- Say,\nplease, could you folks take me wherever you're going? Maybe I could get\na job again--used to was a good waitress, and I ain't going to wait here\nany longer for that lying, cheating, mean-talking----\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Kloh, please don't! He's dead!\" wailed Claire.\n\n\"Dead? Pinky? Oh--my--God! And I won't ever see him, and he was so funny\nand----\"\n\nShe threw herself on the ground; she kicked her heels; she tore at her\nloosely caught, tarnished blonde hair.\n\nClaire knelt by her. \"You mustn't--you mustn't--we'll----\"\n\n\"Damn you, with your smug-faced husband there, and your fine auto and\nall, butting into poor folks' troubles!\" shrieked Dlorus.\n\nClaire stumbled to her feet, stood with her clenched right hand to her\ntrembling lips, cupping it with her nervous left hand. Her shoulders\nwere dejected. Milt pleaded, \"Let's hike out. I don't mind decent honest\ngrease, but this place--look in at table! Dirty dishes---- And gin\nbottles on the floor!\"\n\n\"Desert her? When she needs me so?\" Claire started forward, but Milt\ncaught her sleeve, and admired, \"You were right! You've got more nerve\nthan I have!\"\n\n\"No. I wouldn't dare if---- I'm glad you're here with me!\"\n\nClaire calmed the woman; bound up her hair; washed her face--which\nneeded it; and sat on the log doorstep, holding Dlorus's head in her\nlap, while Dlorus sobbed, \"Pinky--dead! Him that was so lively! And he\nwas so sweet a lover, oh, so sweet. He was a swell fellow; my, he could\njust make you laugh and cry, the way he talked; and he was so educated,\nand he played the vi'lin--he could do anything--and athaletic--he would\nhave made me rich. Oh, let me alone. I just want to be alone and think\nof him. I was so bored with Kloh, and no nice dresses or nothin', and--I\ndid love the kid, but he squalled so, just all the time, and Pinky come,\nand he was so funny---- Oh, let me alone!\"\n\nClaire shivered, then, and the strength seemed to go from the steady\narms that had supported Dlorus's head. Dusk had sneaked up on them; the\nclearing was full of swimming grayness, and between the woman's screams,\nthe woods crackled. Each time Dlorus spoke, her screech was like that of\nan animal in the woods, and round about them crept such sinister echoes\nthat Milt kept wanting to look back over his shoulder.\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed Claire at last, \"perhaps we'd better go.\"\n\n\"If you go, I'll kill myself! Take me to Mr. Kloh! Oh, he was---- My\nhusband, Mr. Kloh. Oh, so good. Only he didn't understand a lady has to\nhave her good times, and Pink danced so well----\"\n\nDlorus sprang up, flung into the cabin, stood in the dimness of the\ndoorway, holding a butcher knife and clamoring, \"I will! I'll kill\nmyself if you leave me! Take me down to Mr. Kloh, at North Yakima,\ntonight!\"\n\nMilt sauntered toward her.\n\n\"Don't you get flip, young man! I mean it! And I'll kill you----\"\n\nMost unchivalrously, quite out of the picture of gray grief, Milt\nsnapped, \"That'll be about enough of you! Here! Gimme that knife!\"\n\nShe dropped the knife, sniveling, \"Oh Gawd, somebody's always bullying\nme! And all I wanted was a good time!\"\n\nClaire herded her into the cabin. \"We'll take you to your\nhusband--tonight. Come, let's wash up, and I'll help you put on your\nprettiest dress.\"\n\n\"Honest, will you?\" cried the woman, in high spirits, all grief put\naside. \"I got a dandy China silk dress, and some new white kid shoes!\nMy, Mr. Kloh, he won't hardly know me. He'll take me back. I know how to\nhandle him. That'll be swell, going back in an automobile. And I got a\nnew hair-comb, with genuine Peruvian diamonds. Say, you aren't kidding\nme along?\"\n\nIn the light of the lantern Milt had kindled, Claire looked\nquestioningly at him. Both of them shrugged. Claire promised, \"Yes.\nTonight. If we can make it.\"\n\n\"And will you jolly Mr. Kloh for me? Gee, I'll be awfully scared of him.\nI swear, I'll wash his dishes and everything. He's a good man. He----\nSay, he ain't seen my new parasol, neither!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nACROSS THE ROOF OF THE WORLD\n\n\nClaire dressed Dlorus, cooked a dinner of beet greens, potatoes, and\ntrout; and by bullying and great sweetness kept Dlorus from too many\ntrips to the gin bottle. Milt caught the trout, cut wood, locked in a\nlog shed Pinky's forlorn mining-tools. They started for North Yakima at\neight of the evening, with Dlorus, back in the spare seat, alternately\nsobbing and to inattentive ears announcing what she'd say to the Old\nHens.\n\nMilt was devoted to persuading the huge cat of a car to tiptoe down the\nslippery gouged ruts of the road, and Claire's mind was driving with\nhim. Every time he touched the foot-brake, she could feel the strain in\nthe tendons of her own ankle.\n\nA mile down the main road they stopped at a store-post-office to\ntelephone back to Mr. Boltwood and Dr. Beach. On the porch was a man in\noveralls and laced boots. He was lean and quick-moving. As he raised his\nhead, and his spectacles flashed, Claire caught Milt's arm and gasped,\n\"Oh, my dear, I'm in a beautiful state of nerves. For a moment I thought\nthat was Jeff Saxton. I bet it is his astral body!\"\n\n\"And you thought he was going to forbid your running away on this fool\nexpedition, and you were scared,\" chuckled Milt, as they sat in the car.\n\n\"Of course I was! And I still am! I know what he'll say afterward! He\n_is_ here, reasoning with me. Oughtn't I to be sensible? Oughtn't I to\nhave you leave me at the Beaches' before you start--jolly jaunt to take\na strange woman to her presumably homicidal husband! Why am I totally\nlacking in sense? Just listen to what Jeff is saying!\"\n\n\"Of course you ought to go back, and let me drive alone. Absolutely\ninsane, your----\"\n\n\"But you would like me to go along, wouldn't you!\"\n\n\"Like you to? It's our last ride together, and that bloomin' old\nBrowning never thought of a ride together by midnight over the roof of\nthe world! No, it's really our first ride together, and tomorrow--you're\ngone.\"\n\n\"No, I sha'n't be gone, but----\" Addressing herself to the astounded\noveralled man on the porch, she declared, \"You're quite right, Jeff. And\nMilt is wrong. Insane adventure. Only, it's wonderful to be young enough\nto do insane adventures. Falling down abyssy places is so much more\ninteresting than bridge. I'm going--going--going!... Milt, you\ntelephone.\"\n\n\"Don't you think you better?\"\n\n\"No, siree! Father would forbid me. Try not to get him--just tell Dr.\nBeach where we're going, and hang up, and scoot!\"\n\nAll night they drove; down the Pacific side of Blewett Pass; down the\nsweeping spirals to a valley. Dlorus drowsed in the extra seat. Claire's\nsleepy head was fantastically swaying. She was awakened by an\napproaching roar and, as though she sat at a play, she watched a big\nracing machine coming toward them, passing them with two wheels in the\nditch. She had only a thunderous glimpse of the stolid driver; a dark,\nhooded, romantic figure, like a sailor at the helm in a storm.\n\nMilt cried, \"Golly! May be a transcontinental racer! Be in New York in\nfive days--going night and day--take mud at fifty an hour--crack\nmechanic right from the factory--change tires in three minutes--people\nwaiting up all night to give him gasoline and a sandwich! That's my idea\nof fun!\"\n\nStudying Milt's shadowed face, Claire considered, \"He could do it, too.\nSitting there at the wheel, taking danger and good road with the same\nsteadiness. Oh, he's--well, anyway, he's a dear boy.\"\n\nBut what she said was:\n\n\"Less dramatic things for you, now, Milt. Trigonometry is going to be\nyour idea of fun; blueprints and engineering books.\"\n\n\"Yes. I know. I'm going to do it. Do four years' work in three--or two.\nI'll tack pages of formulas on the wall, in my bum hallroom, and study\n'em while I'm shaving. Oh, I'll be the grind! But learn to dance the\nfox-trot, though! If America gets into the war, I'll get into the\nengineering corps, and come back to school afterward.\"\n\n\"Will the finances----\"\n\n\"I'll sell my garage, by mail. Rauskukle will take it. He won't rob me\nof more than a thousand dollars on price--not much more.\"\n\n\"You're going to love Seattle. And we'll have some good tramps while I'm\nthere, you and I.\"\n\n\"Honestly? Will you want to?\"\n\n\"Do you suppose for one second I'd give up my feeling of free air? If\nyou don't come and get me, I'll call on you and make you come!\"\n\n\"Warn you I'll probably be living over some beanery.\"\n\n\"Probably. With dirty steps leading up to it. I'll sweep the steps. I'll\ncook supper for you. I can do things, can't I! I did manage Dlorus,\ndidn't I!\"\n\nHe was murmuring, \"Claire, dear!\" when she changed her tone to the echo\nof Brooklyn Heights, and hurried on, \"You do understand, don't you!\nWe'll be, uh, good friends.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He drove with much speed and silence.\n\nThough they were devouring the dark road, though roadside rocks, caught\nby the headlights, seemed to fly up at them, though they went on\nforever, chased by a nightmare, Claire snuggled down in security. Her\nhead drooped against his shoulder. He put his arm about her, his hand\nabout her waist. She sleepily wondered if she ought to let him. She\nheard herself muttering, \"Sorry I was so rude when you were so rude,\"\nand her chilly cheek discovered that the smooth-worn shoulder of his old\nblue coat was warm, and she wondered some more about the questions of\nwaists and hands and---- She was asleep.\n\nShe awoke, bewildered to find that dawn was slipping into the air. While\nshe had slept Milt had taken his arm from about her and fished out a\nlap-robe for her. Behind them, Dlorus was slumbering, with her soft\nmouth wide open. Claire felt the luxury of the pocket of warmth under\nthe lap-robe; she comfortably stretched her legs while she pictured Milt\ndriving on all the night, rigid, tireless, impersonal as the engineer of\na night express.\n\nThey came into North Yakima at breakfast time, and found the house of\nMr. Kloh, a neat, bare, drab frame box, with tight small front and back\nyards. Dlorus was awake, and when she wasn't yawning, she was enjoying\nbeing hysterical.\n\n\"Miss Boltwood,\" she whined, \"you go in and jolly him up.\"\n\nMilt begged, \"Better let me do it, Claire.\"\n\nThey looked squarely at each other. \"No, I think I'd better,\" she\ndecided.\n\n\"Right, Claire, but--I wish I could do more things for you.\"\n\n\"I know!\"\n\nHe lifted her stiff, cold little body from the car. His hands under her\narms, he held her on the running-board an instant, her eyes level with\nhis. \"Little sister--plucky little sister!\" he sighed. He lowered her to\nthe ground.\n\nClaire knocked at the back door. To it came a bald, tired man, in an\napron wet at the knees. The kitchen floor was soaped, and a\nscrubbing-brush rode amid the seas. A rather dirty child clung to his\nhand. \"Trying to clean up, ma'am. Not very good at it. I hope you ain't\nthe Cruelty to Children lady. Willy looks mussed, but fact is, I just\ncan't get time to wash the clothes, but he means a terrible lot to me.\nWhat was it? Will you step in?\"\n\nClaire buttoned the child's rompers before she spoke. Then:\n\n\"Mr. Kloh, I want to be perfectly honest with you. I've had word from\nyour wife. She's unhappy, and she loves and admires you more than any\nother man in the world, and I think she would come back--misses the\nchild so.\"\n\nThe man wiped his reddened hands. \"I don't know---- I don't wish her no\nharm. Trouble was, I'm kind of pokey. I guess I couldn't give her any\ngood times. I used to try to go to dances with her, but when I'd worked\nlate, I'd get sleepy and---- She's a beautiful woman, smart 's a whip,\nand I guess I was too slow for her. No, she wouldn't never come back to\nme.\"\n\n\"She's out in front of the house now--waiting!\"\n\n\"Great C\u00c3\u00a6sar's ghost, and the floor not scrubbed!\" With a squawk of\nanxiety he leaped on the scrubbing-brush, and when Milt and Dlorus\nappeared at the door, Mr. Kloh and Miss Claire Boltwood were wiping up\nthe kitchen floor.\n\nDlorus looked at them, arms akimbo, and sighed, \"Hello, Johnny, my,\nain't it nice to be back, oh, you had the sink painted, oh, forgive me,\nJohnny, I was a bad ungrateful woman, I don't care if you don't never\ntake me to no more dances, hardly any, Willy come here, dear, oh, he is\nsuch a sweet child, my, his mouth is so dirty, will you forgive me,\nJohnny, is my overcoat in the moth-balls?\"\n\nWhen Mr. Kloh had gone off to the mill--thrice returning from the gate\nto kiss Dlorus and to thank her rescuers--Claire sat down and yawningly\nlashed off every inch of Dlorus's fair white skin:\n\n\"You're at it already; taking advantage of that good man's forgiveness,\nand getting lofty with him, and rather admiring yourself as a\nspectacular sinner. You are a lazy, ignorant, not very clean woman, and\nif you succeed in making Mr. Kloh and Willy happy, it will be almost too\nbig a job for you. Now if I come back from Seattle and find you\nmisbehaving again----\"\n\nDlorus broke down. \"You won't, miss! And I will raise chickens, like he\nwanted, honest I will!\"\n\n\"Then you may let me have a room to take a nap in, and perhaps Mr.\nDaggett could sleep in there on the sofa, and we'll get rested before we\nstart back.\"\n\nBoth Milt and Dlorus meekly followed the boss.\n\nIt was noon before Milt and Claire woke, and discovered that Dlorus had\nprepared for them scrambled eggs and store celery, served on an almost\nclean table-cloth. Mr. Kloh came home for lunch, and while Dlorus sat on\nhis lap in the living-room, and repeated that she had been a \"bad,\nnaughty, 'ittle dirl--what did the fellows say at the mill?\" Milt and\nClaire sat dumpily on the back porch, regarding scenery which featured\nof seven tin cans, a broken patent washing-machine, and a rheumatic pear\ntree.\n\n\"I suppose we ought to start,\" groaned Claire.\n\n\"I have about as much nerve as a rabbit, and as much punch as a bale of\nhay,\" Milt admitted.\n\n\"We're like two children that have been playing too long.\"\n\n\"But don't want to go home!\"\n\n\"Quite! Though I don't think much of your idea of a playhouse--those tin\ncans. But it's better than having to be grown-up.\"\n\nIn the midst of which chatter they realized that Mr. Henry B. Boltwood\nand Dr. Hooker Beach had come round the corner of the house, and were\ngaping at them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE GRAEL IN A BACK YARD IN YAKIMA\n\n\n\"I must say that you two have chosen a fine pastoral scene!\" observed\nMr. Boltwood.\n\n\"Hhhhhhhhow did you get here?\" gasped Claire.\n\n\"Auto 'bus over Blewett Pass, train here from Ellensburg. That\nwoman--everything all right?\"\n\n\"Yes, everything's fine. We were just starting back, sir,\" implored\nMilt.\n\n\"Huh!\"\n\n\"Awfully sorry, sir, to take Claire on such a hike----\"\n\n\"I don't blame you particularly. When that young woman gets an idea into\nher head, the rest of us are pawns. Why, even me--she's dragged me all\nover the Rocky Mountains. And I will admit, Claire, that it's been good\nfor me. But I begin to feel human again, and I think it's about time I\ntook charge. We'll catch the afternoon train for Seattle, Claire. The\ntrip has been extremely interesting, but I think perhaps we'll call it\nenough. Daggett, want to get you to drive the Gomez on to Seattle. Beach\ntells me your car is completely wrecked. Lose any money in it?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Had my roll in the bug. I'll have to go back to it and get\nsome clothes out of it, though.\"\n\n\"Well, then, will you drive my car in? Charge me anywhere up to fifty\ndollars, if you want to----\"\n\n\"I'd rather not----\"\n\n\"It's a perfectly honest job--I'd do it, too quick! Or if your\nconfounded pride won't let you charge anything, bring the car on anyway.\nCome, dolly, I have a jitney here, please observe my graceful use of\n'jitney,' and I have the bags. We'll hustle to the station now. No! No\narguments, chick!\"\n\nOn the station platform, Claire and Milt were under the surveillance of\nMr. Boltwood, who was extremely irritable as every two minutes the train\nwas reported to be two minutes later. They tramped up and down, speaking\nin lowered voices, very meek but in their joint naughtiness very\nintimate.\n\n\"That was a nice place to end a transcontinental drive--in the back yard\nof Mr. Johnny Kloh, with an unrestricted view of tin cans!\" lamented\nClaire.\n\n\"Still, your drive didn't end at Kloh's; it ended way up in the\nmountains.\"\n\nMr. Boltwood bumbled down on them: \"Another minute late! Like to know\nwhat the matter is!\"\n\n\"Yes, father!\"\n\nWhen Mr. Boltwood's impatiently waiting back was turned, Claire gripped\nMilt's hand, and whispered to him, \"You see, I'm captured! I thought I\nwas father's lord and chauffeur, but he sniffs the smoke of the ticker.\nIn his mind, he's already back in the office, running things. He'll\nprobably turn me over to Jeff, for disciplining! You won't let them\nchange me back into a pink-face, will you? Come to tea, at the Gilsons',\njust as soon as you reach Seattle.\"\n\n\"Tea---- Now we're so near your Gilsons, I begin to get scared. Wouldn't\nknow what to do. Gee, I've heard you have to balance a tea-cup and a\nsandwich and a hunk o' cake and a lot of conversation all at once! I'd\nspill the tea, and drop crumbs, and probably have the butler set on me.\"\n\n\"You will not! And if you did--can't you see?--it wouldn't matter! It\njust wouldn't matter!\"\n\n\"Honestly? Claire dear, do you know why I came on this trip? In\nSchoenstrom, I heard you say you were going to Seattle. That moment, I\ndecided I would, too, and get acquainted with you, if murder would do\nit. But, oh, I'm clumsy.\"\n\n\"You've seen me clumsy, in driving. You taught me to get over it. Perhaps\nI can teach you some things. And we'll study--together--evenings! I'm a\nthoroughly ignorant parasite woman. Make me become real! A real woman!\"\n\n\"Dear--dear----\"\n\nMr. Boltwood loomed on them. \"The train's coming, at last. We'll have a\ndecent sleep for once, at the Gilsons'. I've wired them to meet us.\" He\ndeparted.\n\n\"Terribly glad your father keeps coming down on us, because it scares\nme so I get desperate,\" said Milt. \"Golly, I think I can hear the train.\nI, uh, Claire, Claire dear----\"\n\n\"Milt, are you proposing to me? Please hurry, because that is the train.\nIsn't it absurd--some day you'll have to propose all over again\nformally, for the benefit of people like father, when you and I already\nknow we're partners! We've done things together, not just danced\ntogether! When you're an engineer, you'll call me, and I'll come\na-running up to Alaska. And sometimes you'll come with me to\nBrooklyn--we'll be a couple of bombs---- There's the train. Oh,\nplaymate, hurry with your engineering course! Hurry, hurry, hurry!\nBecause when it's done, then---- Whither thou goest, there I go also!\nAnd you did bully me, you did, you did, and I like it, and---- Yes,\nfather, the bags are right here. Telephone me, minute you reach Seattle,\ndear, and we'll have a private lesson in balancing tea-cups---- Yes,\nfather, I have the tickets. So glad, dear, the trip smashed up like\nthis--shocked me into reality--made me realize I've been with you every\nhour since I dismissed you, back in Dakota, and you looked at me, big\nhurt eyes, like a child, and---- Yes, father, Pullman's at the back.\nYes, I'm coming!\"\n\n\"W-wait! D-did you know I was going to propose?\"\n\n\"Yes. Ever since the Yellowstone. Been trying to think of a nice way to\nrefuse you. But there isn't any. You're like Pinky--can't get rid of\nyou--have t' adopt you. Besides, I've found out----\"\n\n\"You love me?\"\n\n\"I don't know! How can I tell? But I do like to drive with my head on\nyour shoulder and---- Yesssss, father, coming!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nHER OWN PEOPLE\n\n\nMr. Henry B. Boltwood was decorously asleep in a chair in the\nobservation car, and Claire, on the wide back platform, sat unmoving,\napparently devoted to agriculture and mountain scenery. But it might\nhave been noted that her hand clenched one of the wooden supports of her\ncamp-stool, and that her hunched back did not move.\n\nWhen she had turned to follow her father into the train, Milt had caught\nher shoulders and kissed her.\n\nFor half an hour that kiss had remained, a perceptible warm pressure on\nher lips. And for half an hour she had felt the relief of gliding\nthrough the mountains without the strain of piloting, the comfort of\nhaving the unseen, mysterious engineer up ahead automatically drive for\nher. She had caroled to her father about nearing the Pacific. Her\nnervousness had expressed itself in jerky gaiety.\n\nBut when he had sneaked away for a nap, and Claire could no longer hide\nfrom herself by a veil of chatter the big decision she had made on the\nstation platform, then she was lonely and frightened--and very anxious\nto undecide the decision. She could not think clearly. She could see\nMilt Daggett only as a solemn young man in an inferior sweater,\nstanding by the track in a melancholy autumnal light, waving to her as\nthe train pulled out, disappearing in a dun obscurity, less significant\nthan the station, the receding ties, or the porter who was, in places\nknown only to his secretive self, concealing her baggage.\n\nShe could only mutter in growing panic, \"I'm crazy. In-sane! Pledging\nmyself to this boy before I know how he will turn out. Will he learn\nanything besides engineering? I know it--I do want to stroke his cheek\nand--his kiss frightened me, but---- Will I hate him when I see him with\nnice people? Can I introduce him to the Gilsons? Oh, I was mad; so\nwrought up by that idiotic chase with Dlorus, and so sure I was a\nromantic heroine and---- And I'm simply an indecisive girl in a\nrealistic muddle!\"\n\nThreatened by darkness and the sinister evening chill of the mountains,\nwith the train no longer cheerfully climbing the rocky ridge but\nrumbling and snorting in the defiles, and startling her with agitating\nforward leaps as though the brakes had let go, she could not endure the\nbleak platform, and even less could she endure sitting in the chair car,\neyed by the smug tourists--people as empty of her romance as they were\nincapable of her sharp tragedy. She balanced forward to the vestibule.\nShe stood in that cold, swaying, darkling place that was filled with the\nsmell of rubber and metal and grease and the thunderous clash of steel\non steel; she tried to look out into the fleeing darkness; she tried to\nimagine that the train was carrying her away from the pursuing\nenemy--from her own weak self.\n\nHer father came puffing and lip-pursing and jolly, to take her to\ndinner. Mr. Boltwood had no tearing meditations; he had a healthy\ninterest in soup. But he glanced at her, across the bright, sleek\ndining-table; he seemed to study her; and suddenly Claire saw that he\nwas a very wise man. His look hinted, \"You're worried, my dear,\" but his\nvoice ventured nothing beyond comfortable drawling stories to which she\nhad only, from the depth of her gloomy brooding, to nod mechanically.\n\nShe got a great deal of satisfaction and horror out of watching two\ntraveling-men after dinner. Milt had praised the race, and one of the\ntwo traveling-men, a slender, clear-faced youngster, was rather like\nMilt, despite plastered hair, a watch-chain slung diagonally across his\nwaistcoat, maroon silk socks, and shoes of pearl buttons, gray tops, and\npatent-leather bottoms. The other man was a butter-ball. Both of them\nhad harshly pompous voices--the proudly unlettered voices of the smoking\ncompartment. The slender man was roaring:\n\n\"Yes, sir, he's got a great proposition there--believe me, he's got a\ngreat proposition--he's got one great little factory there, take it from\nme. He can turn out toothpicks to compete with Michigan. He's simply\npiling up the shekels--why say, he's got a house with eighteen\nrooms--every room done different.\"\n\nClaire wondered whether Milt, when the sting and faith of romance were\nblunted, would engage in Great Propositions, and fight for the\nrecognition of his--toothpicks. Would his creations be favorites in the\nbest lunch rooms? Would he pile up shekels?\n\nThen her fretting was lost in the excitement of approaching Seattle and\ntheir host--Claire's cousin, Eugene Gilson, an outrageously prosperous\nowner of shingle-mills. He came from an old Brooklyn Heights family. He\nhad married Eva Gontz of Englewood. He liked music and wrote jokey\nlittle letters and knew the addresses of all the best New York shops. He\nwas of Her Own People, and she was near now to the security of his\nfriendship, the long journey done.\n\nLights thicker and thicker--a factory illuminated by arc-lamps,--the\nbaggage--the porter--the eager trail of people in the aisle--climbing\ndown to the platform--red caps--passing the puffing engine which had\nbrought them in--the procession to the gate--faces behind a\ngrill--Eugene Gilson and Eva waving--kisses, cries of \"How was the\ntrip?\" and \"Oh! Had won-derful drive!\"--the huge station, and curious\nwaiting passengers, Jap coolies in a gang, lumbermen in corks--the\nGilsons' quiet car, and baggage stowed away by the chauffeur instead of\nby their own tired hands--streets strangely silent after the tumult of\nthe train--Seattle and the sunset coast at last attained.\n\nClaire had forgotten how many charming, most desirable things there were\nin the world. The Gilsons drove up Queen Anne Hill to a bay-fronting\nhouse on a breezy knob--a Georgian house of holly hedge, French windows,\na terrace that suggested tea, and a great hall of mahogany and white\nenamel with the hint of roses somewhere, and a fire kindled in the\npaneled drawing-room to be seen beyond the hall. Warmth and softness and\nthe Gilsons' confident affection wrapped her around; and in contented\nweariness she mounted to a bedroom of Bakst sketches, a four-poster, and\na bedside table with a black and orange electric lamp and a collection\nof Arthur Symons' essays.\n\nShe sank by the bed, pitifully rubbed her cheek against the silk\ncomforter that was primly awaiting her commands at the foot of the bed,\nand cried, \"Oh, four-posters _are_ necessary! I can't give them up! I\nwon't! They---- No one has a right to ask me.\" She mentally stamped her\nfoot. \"I simply won't live in a shack and take in washing. It isn't\nworth it.\"\n\nA bath, faintly scented, in a built-in tub in her own marble bathroom. A\npreposterously and delightfully enormous Turkish towel. One of Eva\nGilson's foamy neglig\u00c3\u00a9es. Slow exquisite dressing--not the scratchy\nhopping over ingrown dirt, among ingrown smells, of a filthy\nsmall-hotel bedroom, but luxurious wandering over rugs velvety to her\nbare feet. A languid inspection of the frivolous colors and curves in\nthe drawings by Bakst and George Plank and Helen Dryden. A glance at the\nrichness of the toilet-table, at the velvet curtains that shut out the\ncommon world.\n\nExpanding to the comfort as an orchid to cloying tropic airs, she drew\non her sheerest chemise, her most frivolous silk stockings. In a\ndreaming enervated joy she saw how smooth were her arms and legs; she\nsleepily resented the redness of her wrists and the callouses of the\ntexture of corduroy that scored her palms from holding the steering\nwheel.\n\nYes, she was glad that she had made the experiment--but gladder that she\nwas safely in from the long dust-whitened way, back in her own world of\nbeauty; and she couldn't imagine ever trying it again. To think of\nclumping out into that world of deliberate and brawling crudeness----\n\nOf one Milt Daggett she didn't think at all.\n\nGorgeously sleepy--and gorgeously certain that by and by she would go,\nnot to a stingy hotel bed, with hound-dog ribs to cut into her tired\nback, but to a feathery softness of slumber--she wavered down to the\ndrawing-room, and on the davenport, by the fire, with Victoria\nchocolates by her elbow, and pillows behind her shoulders, she gossiped\nof her adventure, and asked for news of friends and kin back East.\n\nEugene and Eva Gilson asked with pyrotechnic merriness about the \"funny\npeople she must have met along the road.\" With a subdued, hidden\nunhappiness, Claire found that she could not mention Milt--that she was\nafraid her father would mention Milt--to these people who took it for\ngranted that all persons who did not live in large houses and play good\ngames of bridge were either \"queer\" or \"common\"; who believed that their\nWest was desirable in proportion as it became like the East; and that\nthey, though Westerners, were as superior to workmen with hard hands as\nwas Brooklyn Heights itself.\n\nClaire tried to wriggle out from under the thought of Milt while, with\nthe Gilsons as the perfect audience, she improvised on the theme of\nwandering. With certain unintended exaggerations, and certain not quite\naccurate groupings of events, she described the farmers and cowpunchers,\nthe incredible hotels and garages. Indeed they had become incredible to\nher own self. Obviously this silken girl couldn't possibly take\nseriously a Dlorus Kloh--or a young garage man who said \"ain't.\"\n\nEva Gilson had been in Brooklyn within the month, and in a passion of\nremembrance of home, Claire cried, \"Oh, do tell me about everybody.\"\n\n\"I had such a good time with Amy Dorrance,\" said Mrs. Gilson. \"Of course\nAmy is a little dull, but she's such an awfully good sort and---- We did\nhave the jolliest party one afternoon. We went to lunch at the Ritz,\nand a matin\u00c3\u00a9e, and we saw such an interesting man--Gene is frightfully\njealous when I rave about him--I'm sure he was a violinist--simply an\nexquisite thing he was--I wanted to kiss him. Gene will now say, 'Why\ndidn't you?'\"\n\nAnd Gene said, \"Well, why _didn't_ you?\" and Claire laughed, and her\ntoes felt warm and pink and good, and she was perfectly happy, and she\nmurmured, \"It would be good to hear a decent violinist again. Oh! What\nhad George Worlicht been doing, when you were home?\"\n\n\"Don't you think Georgie is wonderful?\" fluttered Mrs. Gilson. \"He makes\nme rue my thirty-six sad years. I think I'll adopt him. You know, he\nalmost won the tennis cup at Long Branch.\"\n\nGeorgie had a little mustache and an income, just enough income to\nsupport the little mustache, and he sang inoffensively, and was always\nwinning tennis cups--almost--and he always said, at least once at every\nparty, \"The basis of _savoir faire_ is knowing how to be rude to the\nright people.\" Fire-enamored and gliding into a perfumed haze of\nexquisite drowsiness, Claire saw Georgie as heroic and wise. But the\nfirelight got into her eyes, and her lids wouldn't stay open, and in her\nears was a soft humming as of a million bees in a distant meadow\ngolden-spangled--and Gene was helping her upstairs; sleepiness submerged\nher like bathing in sweet waters; she fumbled at buttons and hooks and\nstays, let things lie where they fell--and of all that luxury nothing\nwas more pleasant than the knowledge that she did not have to take\nprecautions against the rats, mice, cockroaches, and all their obscene\nlittle brothers which--on some far-off fantastic voyaging when she had\nbeen young and foolish--she seemed to remember having found in her own\nroom. Then she was sinking into a bed like a tide of rainbow-colored\nfoam, sinking deep, deep, deep----\n\nAnd it was morning, and she perceived that the purpose of morning light\nwas to pick out surfaces of mahogany and orange velvet and glass, and\nthat only an idiot would ever leave this place and go about begging\ndirty garage men to fill her car with stinking gasoline and oil.\n\nThe children were at breakfast--children surely not of the same species\nas the smeary-cheeked brats she had seen tumbling by roadsides along the\nway--sturdy Mason, with his cap of curls, and Virginia, with bobbed\nash-blond hair prim about her delicate face. They curtsied, and in\nvoices that actually had intonations they besought her, \"Oh, Cousin\nClaire, would you pleasssssse tell us about drive-to-the-coast?\"\n\nAfter breakfast, she went out on the terrace for the View.\n\nIn Seattle, even millionaires, and the I. W. W., and men with red\ngarters on their exposed shirt-sleeves who want to give you real estate,\nall talk about the View. The View is to Seattle what the car-service,\nthe auditorium, the flivver-factory, or the price of coal is to other\ncities. At parties in Seattle, you discuss the question of whether the\nView of Lake Union or the View of the Olympics is the better, and polite\noffice-managers say to their stenographers as they enter, \"How's your\nView this morning?\" All real-estate deeds include a patent on the View,\nand every native son has it as his soundest belief that no one in Tacoma\ngets a View of Mount Rainier.\n\nMrs. Gilson informed Claire that they had the finest View in Seattle.\n\nBelow Claire was the harbor, with docks thrust far out into the water,\nand steamers alive with smoke. Mrs. Gilson said they were Blue Funnel\nLiners, loading for Vladivostok and Japan. The names, just the names,\nshot into Claire's heart a wistful unexpressed desire that was somehow\nvaguely connected with a Milt Daggett who, back in the Middlewestern mud\nand rain, had longed for purple mountains and cherry blossoms and the\nsea. But she cast out the wish, and lifted her eyes to mountains across\nthe sound--not purple mountains, but sheer silver streaked with black,\nlike frozen surf on a desolate northern shore--the Olympics, two-score\nmiles away.\n\nUp there, one could camp, with a boy in a deteriorated sweater singing\nas he watched the coffee----\n\nHastily she looked to the left, across the city, with its bright new\nskyscrapers, its shining cornices and masses of ranked windows, and the\nexclamation-point of the \"tallest building outside of New York\"--far\nlivelier than her own rusty Brooklyn. Beyond the city was a dun cloud,\nbut as she stared, far up in the cloud something crept out of the vapor,\nand hung there like a dull full moon, aloof, majestic, overwhelming, and\nshe realized that she was beholding the peak of Mount Rainier, with the\ncity at its foot like white quartz pebbles at the base of a tower.\n\nA landing-stage for angels, she reflected.\n\nIt did seem larger than dressing-tables and velvet hangings and scented\nbaths.\n\nBut she dragged herself from the enticing path of that thought, and\nsighed wretchedly, \"Oh, yes, he would appreciate Rainier, but how--how\nwould he manage a grape-fruit? I mustn't be a fool! I mustn't!\" She saw\nthat Mrs. Gilson was peeping at her, and she made herself say adequate\nthings about the View before she fled inside--fled from her sputtering\ninquiring self.\n\nIn the afternoon they drove to Capitol Hill; they dropped in at various\npretty houses and met the sort of people Claire knew back home. Between\npeople they had Views; and the sensible Miss Boltwood, making a\nphilosophic discovery, announced to herself, \"After all, I've seen just\nas much from this limousine as I would from a bone-breaking Teal bug.\nSilly to make yourself miserable to see things. Oh yes, I will go\nwandering some more, but not like a hobo. But---- What can I say to him?\nGood heavens, he may be here any time now, with our car. Oh,\nwhy--why--why was I insane on that station platform?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE ABYSSINIAN PRINCE\n\n\nSnoqualmie Pass lies among mountains prickly with rocks and burnt\nstumps, but the road is velvet, with broad saucer curves; and to Milt it\nwas pure beauty, it was release from life, to soar up coaxing inclines\nand slip down easy grades in the powerful car. \"No more Teals for me,\"\nhe cried, in the ecstasy of handling an engine that slowed to a demure\nwhisper, then, at a touch of the accelerator, floated up a rise,\neffortless, joyous, humming the booming song of the joy in speed. He\nsuddenly hated the bucking tediousness of the Teal. The Gomez-Dep\nsymbolized his own new life.\n\nSo he came to Lake Washington, and just across it was the city of his\nlong dreams, the city of the Pacific--and of Claire. There was no ferry\nin sight, and he rounded the lake, struck a brick pavement, rolled\nthrough rough woods, suburban villas, and petty business streets, to a\nregion of factories and mills, with the funnels of ships beyond.\n\nAnd every minute he drove more slowly and became more uneasy.\n\nThe pavement--the miles of it; the ruthless lumbermills, with their\nthousands of workmen quite like himself; the agitation of realizing\nthat every three minutes he was passing a settlement larger than\nSchoenstrom; the strangeness of ships and all the cynical ways of the\nsea--the whole scene depressed him as he perceived how little of the\nworld he knew, and how big and contemptuous of Milt Daggetts that world\nmust be.\n\n\"Huh!\" he growled. \"Quite some folks living here. Don't suppose they\nspend such a whale of a lot of time thinking about Milt Daggett and Bill\nMcGolwey and Prof Jones. I guess most of these people wouldn't think\nHeinie Rauskukle's store was so gosh-awful big. I wasn't scared of\nMinneapolis--much--but there they didn't ring in mountains and an ocean\non you. And I didn't have to go up on the hill and meet folks like\nClaire's relations, and figure out whether you shake hands\ncatch-as-catch-can or Corinthian. Look at that sawmill chimney--isn't it\nnice of 'em to put the fly-screen over it so the flies won't get down\ninto the flames. No, they haven't got much more than a million feet of\nlumber in that one pile. And here's a bum little furniture store--it\nwouldn't cost more 'n about ten times all I've got to buy one of those\nMorris chairs. Oh Gooooooosh, won't these houses ever stop? Say, that\nmust be a jitney. The driver snickered at me. Will the whole town be\nonto me? Milt, you're a kind young fellow, and you know what's the\nmatter with Heinie's differential, but they don't need you here. Quite\na few folks to carry on the business. Gosh, look at that building\nahead--nine stories!\"\n\nHe had planned to stop at a hotel, to wash up, and to gallop to Claire.\nBut--well--wouldn't it maybe be better to leave the car at a public\ngarage, so the Boltwoods could get it when they wanted to? He'd better\n\"just kind of look around before he tackled the watch-dog.\"\n\nIt was the public garage which finally crushed him. It was a garage of\nenameled brick and colored tiles, with a plate-glass-enclosed office in\nwhich worked young men clad as the angels. One of them wore a carnation,\nMilt noted.\n\n\"Huh! I'll write back and tell Ben Sittka that hereafter he's to wear\nhis best-Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes and a milkweed blossom when he\ncomes down to work at the Red Trail Garage!\"\n\nMilt drove up the brick incline into a room thousands of miles long,\nwith millions of new and recently polished cars standing in lines as\nstraight as a running-board. He begged of a high-nosed colored\nfunctionary--not in khaki overalls but in maroon livery--\"Where'll I put\nthis boat?\"\n\nThe Abyssinian prince gave him a check, and in a tone of extreme lack of\npersonal interest snapped, \"Take it down the aisle to the elevator.\"\n\nMilt had followed the natural lines of traffic into the city; he had\nspoken to no one; the prince's snort was his welcome to Seattle.\n\nMeekly he drove past the cars so ebon and silvery, so smug and strong,\nthat they would have regarded a Teal bug as an insult. Another attendant\nwaved him into the elevator, and Milt tried not to look surprised when\nthe car started, not forward, but upward, as though it had turned into\nan aeroplane.\n\nWhen these adventures were over, when he had had a shave and a shine,\nand washed his hands, and looked into a department-store window that\ncontained ten billion yards of silk draped against polished satinwood,\nwhen he had felt unhappy over a movie theater large enough to contain\nten times the population of Schoenstrom, and been cursed by a policeman\nfor jaywalking, and had passed a hotel entirely full of diplomats and\nmarble and caviare--then he could no longer put off telephoning to\nClaire, and humbly, in a booth meant for an umbrella-stand, he got the\nEugene Gilson house, and to a female who said \"Yes?\" in a tone which\nmade it mean \"No!\" he ventured, \"May I speak to Miss Boltwood?\"\n\nMiss Boltwood, it seemed, was out.\n\nHe was not sorry. He was relieved. He ducked out of the telephone-booth\nwith a sensation of escape.\n\nMilt was in love with Claire; she was to him the purpose of life; he\nthought of her deeply and tenderly and longingly. All the way into\nSeattle he had brooded about her; remembered her every word and\ngesture; recalled the curve of her chin, and the fresh feeling of her\nhands. But Claire had suddenly become too big. In her were all these\nstores, these office buildings for clever lawyers and surgeons, these\ncontemptuous trolley cars, these careless people in beautiful clothes.\nThey were too much for him. Desperately he was pushing them\nback--back--fighting for breath. And she belonged with them.\n\nHe mailed the check for the stored car to her, with a note--written\nstanding before a hacked wall-desk in a branch post-office--which said\nonly, \"Here's check for the boat. Did not know whether you would have\nroom for it at house. Tried to get you on phone, phone again just as\nsoon as rent room etc. Hope having happy time, M.D.\"\n\nHe went out to the university. On the trolley he relaxed. But he did not\nexultantly feel that he had won to the Pacific; he could not regard\nSeattle now as a magic city, the Bagdad of modern caravans, with Alaska\nand the Orient on one hand, the forests to the north, and eastward the\nspacious Inland Empire of the wheat. He saw it as a place where you had\nto work hard just to live; where busy policemen despised you because you\ndidn't know which trolley to take; where it was incredibly hard to\nremember even the names of the unceasing streets; where the conductors\nsaid \"Step lively!\" and there was no room to whistle, no time to swap\nstories with a Bill McGolwey at an Old Home lunch-counter.\n\nHe found the university; he talked with the authorities about entering\nthe engineering school; the Y. M. C. A. gave him a list of rooms; and,\nbecause it was cheap, he chose a cubbyhole in a flat over a candy\nstore--a low room, which would probably keep out the rain, but had no\nother virtues. It had one bed, one table, one dissipated bureau, two\nstraight bare chairs, and one venerable lithograph depicting a girl with\nringlets shaking her irritating forefinger at a high-church kitten.\n\nThe landlady consented to his importing an oil-stove for cooking his\nmeals. He bought the stove, with a box of oatmeal, a jar of bacon, and\nhalf a dozen eggs. He bought a plane and solid geometry, and an algebra.\nAt dinner time he laid the algebra beside his plate of anemic bacon and\nleaking eggs. The eggs grew cold. He did not stir. He was reviewing his\nhigh-school algebra. He went down the pages, word by word, steadily,\nquickly, absolutely concentrated--as concentrated as he would recently\nhave been in a new problem of disordered transmission. Not once did he\nstop to consider how glorious it would be to marry Claire--or how\nterrifying it would be to marry Miss Boltwood.\n\nThree hours went by before he started up, bewildered, rubbed his eyes,\npicked at the chill bacon and altogether disgusting eggs, and rambled\nout into the street.\n\nAgain he risked the scorn of conductors and jitney drivers. He found\nQueen Anne Hill, found the residence of Mr. Eugene Gilson. He sneaked\nabout it, slipped into the gate, prowled toward the house. Flabby from\nthe intensity of study, he longed for the stimulus of Claire's smile.\nBut as he stared up at the great squares of the clear windows, at the\nflare of white columns in the porch-lights, that smile seemed\nunreachable. He felt like a rustic at court. From the shelter of the\nprickly holly hedge he watched the house. It was \"some kind of a\nparty?--or what would folks like these call a party?\" Limousines were\narriving; he had a glimpse of silken ankles, frothy underskirts; heard\neasy laughter; saw people moving through a big blue and silver room;\ncaught a drifting tremor of music.\n\nAt last he saw Claire. She was dancing with a young man as decorative as\n\"that confounded Saxton fellow\" he had met at Flathead Lake, but younger\nthan Saxton, a laughing young man, with curly black hair. For the first\ntime in his life Milt wanted to kill. He muttered, \"Damn--damn--DAMN!\"\nas he saw the young man carelessly embracing Claire.\n\nHis fingers tingling, his whole body yearning till every cell seemed a\nbeating hammer, Milt longed just once to slip his hand about Claire's\nwaist like that. He could feel the satin of her bodice and its warmth.\n\nThen it seemed to him, as Claire again passed the window, that he did\nnot know her at all. He had once talked to a girl who resembled her, but\nthat was long ago. He could understand a Gomez-Dep and appreciate a\nbrisk sports-suit, but this girl was of a world unintelligible to him.\nHer hair, in its dips and convolutions, was altogether a puzzle. \"How\ndid she ever fix it like that?\" Her low evening dress--\"what was it made\nof--some white stuff, but was it silk or muslin or what?\" Her shoulders\nwere startling in their bare powdery smoothness--\"how dare that young\npup dance with her?\" And her face, that had seemed so jolly and\nfriendly, floated past the window as pale and illusive as a wisp of fog.\nHis longing for her passed into clumsy awe. He remembered, without\nresentment, that once on a hilltop in Dakota she had coldly forbidden\nhim to follow her.\n\nWith all the pleasure of martyrdom--to make quite sure that he should\nrealize how complete a fool he had been to intrude on Miss Boltwood--he\nstudied the other guests. He gave them, perhaps, a glory they did not\nhave. There were girls sleek as ivory. There was a lean stooped man,\nvery distinguished. There was a bulky man in a dinner coat, with a\nsemi-circle of mustache, and eyes that even at a distance seemed to give\nimpatient orders. He would be a big banker, or a lumberman.\n\nIt was the easy friendliness of all of them that most made Milt feel\nlike an outsider. If a servant had come out and ordered him away, he\nwould have gone meekly ... he fancied.\n\nHe straggled off, too solidly unhappy to think how unhappy he was. In\nhis clammy room he picked up the algebra. For a quarter-hour he could\nnot gather enough vigor to open it. In his lassitude, his elbows felt\nfeeble, his fingers were ready to drop off. He slowly scratched the book\nopen----\n\nAt one o'clock he was reading algebra, his face still and grim. But\nalready it seemed less heartily brick-red.\n\nHe listlessly telephoned to Claire, in the morning.\n\n\"Hello? Oh! Miss Boltwood? This is Milt Daggett.\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh, how are you?\"\n\n\"Why, why I'm--I've got settled. I can get into the engineering school\nall right.\"\n\n\"I'm glad.\"\n\n\"Uh, enjoying Seattle?\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh yes. The mountains---- Do you like it?\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh yes. Sea and all---- Great town.\"\n\n\"Uh, w-when are we going to see you? Daddy had to go East, left you his\nregards. W-when----?\"\n\n\"Why--why I suppose you're awful--awfully busy, meeting people and\nall----\"\n\n\"Yes, I am, rather, but----\" Her hedging uncomfortable tone changed to a\ncry of distress. \"Milt! I must see you. Come up at four this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nHe rushed to a small, hot tailor-shop. He panted \"Press m' suit while I\nwait?\" They gave him a pair of temporary trousers, an undesirable pair\nof trousers belonging to a short fat man with no taste in fabrics, and\nwith these flapping about his lean legs, he sat behind a calico curtain,\nreading _The War Cry_ and looking at a \"fashion-plate\" depicting nine\ngentlemen yachtsmen each nine feet tall, while the Jugoslav in charge\nunfeelingly sprinkled and ironed and patted his suit.\n\nHe spent ten minutes in blacking his shoes, in his room--and twenty\nminutes in getting the blacking off his fingers.\n\nHe was walking through the gate in the Gilson hedge at one minute to\nfour.\n\nBut he had reached Queen Anne Hill at three. For an hour he had walked\nthe crest road, staring at the steamers below, alternately gripping his\nhands with desire of Claire, and timorously finally deciding that he\nwouldn't go to her house--wouldn't ever see her again.\n\nHe came into the hall tremblingly expecting some great thing, some\nrending scene, and she met him with a cool, \"Oh, this is nice. Eva had\nsome little white cakes made for us.\" He felt like a man who has asked\nfor a drink of cold charged water and found it warm and flat.\n\n\"How---- Dandy house,\" he muttered, limply shaking her limp hand.\n\n\"Yes, isn't it a darling. They do themselves awfully well here. I'm\nafraid your bluff, plain, democratic Westerners are a fraud. I hear a\nlot more about 'society' here than I ever did in the East. The sets seem\nfrightfully complicated.\" She was drifting into the drawing-room, to a\ntapestry stool, and Milt was awkwardly stalking a large wing chair,\nwhile she fidgeted:\n\n\"Everybody tells me about how one poor dear soul, a charming lady who\nused to take in washing or salt gold-mines or something, and she came\nhere a little while ago with billions and billions of dollars, and tried\nto buy her way in by shopping for all the charities in town, and\napparently she's just as out of it here as she would be in London. You\nand I aren't exclusive like that, are we!\"\n\nSomehow----\n\nHer \"you and I\" was too kindly, as though she was trying to put him at\nease, as though she knew he couldn't possibly be at ease. With a\nhorribly elaborate politeness, with a smile that felt hot on his\ntwitching cheeks, he murmured, \"Oh no. No, we---- No, I guess----\"\n\nIf he knew what it was he guessed, he couldn't get it out. While he was\ntrying to find out what had become of all the things there were to say\nin the world, a maid came in with an astonishing object--a small, red,\nshelved table on wheels, laden with silver vessels, and cake, and\nsandwiches that were amazingly small and thin.\n\nThe maid was so starched that she creaked. She glanced at Milt----\nClaire didn't make him so nervous that he thought of his clothes, but\nthe maid did. He was certain that she knew that he had blacked his own\nshoes, knew how old were his clothes. He was urging himself, \"Must get\nnew suit tomorrow--ready-made--mustn't forget, now--be sure--get suit\ntomorrow.\" He wanted to apologize to the maid for existing.... He\nwouldn't dare to fall in love with the maid.... And he'd kill the man\nwho said he could be fool enough to fall in love with Miss Boltwood.\n\nHe sipped his tea, and dropped sandwich crumbs, and ached, and panted,\nand peeped at the crushing quantities of pictures and sconces and tables\nand chairs in the room, and wondered what they did with all of them,\nwhile Claire chattered:\n\n\"Yes, we weren't exclusive out on the road. Didn't we meet funny people\nthough! Oh, somehow that 'funny people' sounds familiar. But---- What\nfun that morning was at--Pellago, was it? Heavens, I'm forgetting those\nbeastly little towns already--that place where we hazed the poor\nlandlady who overcharged me.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He was thinking of how much Claire would forget, now. \"Yes. We\ncertainly fixed her, all right. Uh--did you get the storage check for\nyour car?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, thank you. So nice of you to bother with it.\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing at all, nothing---- Nothing at all. Uh---- Do you like\nSeattle?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. Such views--the mountains---- Do you like it?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. Always wanted to see the sea.\"\n\n\"Yes, and---- Such a well-built town.\"\n\n\"Yes, and---- They must do a lot of business here.\"\n\n\"Yes, they---- Oh yes, I do like Seat----\"\n\nHe had darted from his chair, brushed by the tea-wagon, ignoring its\nrattle and the perilous tipping of cups. He put his hand on her\nshoulder, snorted, \"Look here. We're both sparring for time. Stop it.\nIt's--it's all right, Claire. I want you to like me, but I'm not--I'm\nnot like that woman you were telling about that's trying to butt in. I\nknow, Lord I know so well what you're thinking! You're thinking I'm not\nup to the people you've been seeing last couple of days--not up to 'em\nyet, anyway. Well---- We'll be good friends.\"\n\nFearless, now, his awe gone in tenderness, he lifted her chin, looked\nstraight into her eyes, smiled. But his courage was slipping. He wanted\nto run and hide.\n\nHe turned abruptly, grumbling, \"Well, better get back to work now, I\nguess.\"\n\nHer cry was hungry: \"Oh, please don't go.\" She was beside him, shyly\npicking at his sleeve. \"I know what you mean. I like you for being so\nunderstanding. But---- I do like you. You were the perfect companion.\nLet's---- Oh, let's have a walk--and try to laugh again.\"\n\nHe definitely did not want to stay. At this moment he did not love her.\nHe regarded her as an estimable young woman who, for a person so\nidiotically reared, had really shown a good deal of pluck out on the\nroad--where he wanted to be. He stood in the hall disliking his old cap\nwhile she ran up to put on a top coat.\n\nMute, casual, they tramped out of the house together, and down the hill\nto a region of shabby old brown houses like blisters on the hillside.\nThey had little to say, and that little was a polite reminiscence of\nincidents in which neither was interested.\n\nWhen they came back to the Gilson hedge, he stopped at the gate, with\nterrific respectableness removed his cap.\n\n\"Good night,\" she said cheerily. \"Call me up soon again.\"\n\nHe did not answer \"Good night.\" He said \"Good-by\"; and he meant it to be\nhis last farewell. He caught her hand, hastily dropped it, fled down the\nhill.\n\nHe was, he told himself, going to leave Seattle that evening.\n\nThat, doubtless, is the reason why he ran to a trolley, to get to a\ndepartment-store before it closed; and why, precipitating himself upon a\nstartled clerk, he purchased a new suit of chaste blue serge, a new pair\nof tan boots (curiously like some he had seen on the university campus\nthat morning) and a new hat so gray and conservative and felty that it\nmight have been worn by Woodrow Wilson.\n\nHe spent the evening in reading algebra and geometry, and in telling\nhimself that he was beautifully not thinking about Claire.\n\nIn the midst of it, he caught himself at it, and laughed.\n\n\"What you're doing, my friend, is pretending you don't like Claire, so\nthat you can hide from your fool self the fact that you're going to\nsneak back to see her the first chance you get--first time the watch-dog\nis out. Seriously now, son, Claire is impossible for you. No can do. Now\nthat you've been chump enough to leave home---- Oh Lord, I wish I\nhadn't promised to take this room for all winter. Wish I hadn't\nmatriculated at the U. But I'm here now, and I'll stick it out. I'll\nstay here one year anyway, and go back home. Oh! And to---- By Golly!\nShe liked me!\"\n\nHe was thinking of the wild-rose teacher to whom he had given a lift\nback in Dakota. He was remembering her daintiness, her admiration.\n\n\"Now there's somebody who'd make me keep climbing, but wouldn't think I\nwas a poor hick. If I were to drive back next spring, I could find\nher----\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nA CLASS IN ENGINEERING AND OMELETS\n\n\nThe one thing of which Milt Daggett was certain was that now he had\nmanaged to crawl into the engineering school, he must get his degree in\nmechanical engineering. He was older than most of his classmates. He\nmust hurry. He must do four years' work in two.\n\nThere has never been a Freshman, not the most goggle-eyed and earnest of\nthem, who has seen less of classmates, thought less about \"outside\nactivities,\" more grimly centered the universe about his work.\n\nMilt had sold his garage, by mail, to Ben Sittka and Heinie Rauskukle.\nHe had enough money to get through two years, with economy. His life was\nas simple and dull as it had been in Schoenstrom. He studied while he\ncooked his scrappy meals; he pinned mathematical formul\u00c3\u00a6 and mechanical\ndiagrams on the wall, and pored over them while he was dressing--or\nwhile he was trying to break in the new shoes, which were beautiful,\nsqueaky, and confoundedly tight.\n\nHe was taking French and English and \"composition-writing\" in addition\nto engineering, and he made out a schedule of life as humorlessly as a\ngirl grind who intends to be a Latin teacher. When he was not at work,\nor furiously running and yanking chest-weights in the gymnasium, he was\nattending concerts, lectures.\n\nStudying the life about him, he had discovered that the best way to save\ntime was to avoid the lazy friendships of college; the pipe-smoking,\nyawning, comfortable, rather heavy, altogether pleasant wondering about\n\"what'll we do next?\" which occupies at least four hours a day for the\naverage man in college. He would have liked it, as he had liked long\ntalks about nothing with Bill McGolwey at the Old Home Lunch. But he\ncouldn't afford it. He had to be ready to----\n\nThat was the point at which his reflections always came up with a jolt.\nHe was quite clear about the method of getting ready, but he hadn't the\nslightest idea of what he was getting ready for. The moment he had\nredecided to marry Claire, he saw that his only possible future would be\ncelibate machinery-installing in Alaska; and the moment he was content\nwith the prospect of an engineer's camp in Alaskan wilds, his thoughts\nwent crazily fluttering after Claire.\n\nDespite his aloofness, Milt was not unpopular in his class. The\nengineers had few of them the interest in dances, athletics, college\njournalism, which distinguished the men in the academic course. They\nwere older, and more conscious of a living to earn. And Milt's cheerful,\n\"How's the boy?\" his manner of waving his hand--as though to a good\ncustomer leaving the Red Trail Garage with the generator at last\ntamed--indicated that he was a \"good fellow.\"\n\nOne group of collegians Milt did seek. It is true that he had been\ngenuine in scorning social climbers. But it is also true that the men\nwhom he sought to know were the university smart set. Their satisfaction\nin his allegiance would have been lessened, however, had they known how\nlittle he cared for what they thought of him, and with what cruel\ndirectness he was using them as models for the one purpose of pleasing\nMiss Claire Boltwood.\n\nThe American state universities admit, in a pleased way, that though\nYale and Harvard and Princeton may be snobbish, the state universities\nare the refuge of a myth called \"college democracy.\" But there is no\nuniversity near a considerable city into which the inheritors of the\nwealth of that city do not carry all the local social distinctions.\nTheir family rank, their place in the unwritten peerage, determines to\nwhich fraternity they shall be elected, and the fraternity determines\nwith whom--men and girls--they shall be intimate. The sons and daughters\nof Seattle and Tacoma, the scions of old families running in an unbroken\nline clear back to 1880, were amiable to poor outsiders from the Yakima\nvalley and the new claims of Idaho, but they did not often invite them\nto their homes on the two hills and the Boulevard.\n\nYet it was these plutocrats whom Milt followed; they whose boots and\ntable manners, cigarettes and lack of interest in theology, he studied.\nHe met them in his English class. He remarked \"Hello, Smith,\" and\n\"Mornin', Jones,\" as though he liked them but didn't care a hang whether\nthey liked him. And by and by he drifted into their fraternity\ndwelling-house, with a question about the next day's assignment, and met\ntheir friends. He sat pipe-smoking, silent, cheerful, and they seemed to\naccept him. Whenever one of them felt that Milt was intruding, and asked\nimpertinent questions in the manner of a Pullman porter at a Darktown\nball, Milt had a peculiar level look which had been known to generate\ncourtesy even in the offspring of a million dollars. They found that he\nknew more about motor-cars than any of them, and as motor-cars were\namong their greater gods, they considered him wise. He was incomparably\nsimple and unpretentious; they found his presence comfortable.\n\nBut there is a question as to what they would have thought had they\nknown that, lying awake in the morning, Milt unsmilingly repeated:\n\n\"Hair always straight down at the back. Never rounded. Nix on clippers\nover the ears.\n\n\"Matisse is a popular nut artist. Fashionable for the swells to laugh at\nhim, and the fellows on the college papers to rave about him.\n\n\"Blinx and Severan the swellest--the smartest haberdashery in the city.\n\n\"The one way to get in Dutch is to mention labor leaders.\n\n\"Never say 'Pleased to meet you.' Just look about halfway between bored\nand tol'able and say, 'How do you do?'\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll these first three weeks of his life in Seattle, he had seen Claire\nonly on his first call. Twice he had telephoned to her. On one of these\nhigh occasions she had invited him to accompany the family to the\ntheater--which meant to the movies--and he had wretchedly refused; the\nother time she had said that she might stay in Seattle all winter, and\nshe might go any day, and they \"must be sure to have that good long\nwalk\"; and he had said \"oh yes,\" ten or twelve unhappy times, and had\nfelt very empty as he hung up the receiver.\n\nThen she wrote to invite him to late Sunday breakfast at the\nGilsons'--they made a function of it, and called it bruncheon. The hour\nwas given as ten-thirty; most people came at noon; but Milt arrived at\nten-thirty-one, and found only a sleepy butler in sight.\n\nHe waited in the drawing-room for five minutes, feeling like a\nbill-collector. Into the room vaulted a medium-sized, medium-looking,\namiable man, Eugene Gilson, babbling, \"Oh, I say, so sorry to keep you\nwaiting, Mr. Daggett. Rotten shame, do come have a bun or something,\nfrightfully informal these bruncheons, play auction?\"\n\n\"Zallright--no,\" said Milt.\n\nThe host profusely led him to a dining-room where--in English fashion,\nor something like English fashion, or anyway a close approximation to\nthe fictional pictures of English fashion--kidneys and sausages and\nomelets waited in dishes on the side-board. Mr. Gilson poured coffee,\nand chanted:\n\n\"Do try the kidneys. They're usually very fair. Miss Boltwood tells me\nthat you were very good to her on the trip. Must have been jolly trip.\nYou going to be in town some time, oh yes, Claire said you were in the\nuniversity, engineering, wasn't it? have you ever seen our lumbermills,\ndo drop around some---- Try the omelet before the beastly thing gets\ncold, do you mind kicking that button, we'll have some more omelet\nin--any time at the mill and I'll be glad to have some one show you\nthrough, how did you find the roads along the Red Trail?\"\n\n\"Why, pretty fair,\" said Milt.\n\nInto the room precipitated Mrs. Gilson, in a smile, a super-sweater, and\na sports skirt that would have been soiled by any variety of sport more\nviolent than pinochle, and she was wailing as she came:\n\n\"We're disgraced, Gene, is this Mr. Daggett? how do you do, so good of\nyou to come, do try the kidneys, they're usually quite decent, are the\nomelets warm, you might ring for some more, Gene, for heaven's sake give\nme some coffee, Miss Boltwood will be right down, Mr. Daggett, she told\nus how fortunate they were that they met you on the road, did you like\nthe trip, how were the roads?\"\n\n\"Why, they were pretty good,\" said Milt.\n\nClaire arrived, fresh and serene in white taffeta, and she cried\nprettily, \"I ought to have known that you'd be prompt even if no one\nelse in the world is, so glad you came, have you tried the kidneys, and\ndo have an--oh, I see you have tried the omelets, how goes the work at\nthe university?\"\n\n\"Why, fine,\" said Milt.\n\nHe ate stolidly, and looked pleased, and sneaked in a glance at his new\n(and still tight and still squeaky) tan boots to make sure that they\nwere as well polished as they had seemed at home.\n\nFrom nowhere appeared a bustling weighty woman, purring, \"Hello, hello,\nhello, is it possible that you're all up---- Mr. Daggett. Yes, do lead\nme to the kidneys.\"\n\nAnd a man with the gray hair of a grandfather and the giggle of a\ncash-girl bounced in clamoring, \"Mornin'--expected to have bruncheon\nalone--do we have some bridge? Oh, good morning, Mr. Daggett, how do\nyou like Seattle? Oh, thanks so much, yes, just two.\"\n\nThen Milt ceased to keep track of the conversation, which bubbled over\nthe omelets, and stewed over the kidneys, and foamed about the coffee,\nand clashed above a hastily erected bridge table, and altogether sounded\ncuriously like four cars with four quite different things the matter\nwith them all being tried out at once in a small garage. People flocked\nin, and nodded as though they knew one another too well to worry about\nit. They bowed to him charmingly, and instantly forgot him for the\nkidneys and sausages. He sat looking respectable and feeling lonely, by\na cup of coffee, till Claire--dropping the highly unreal smile with\nwhich she had been listening to the elderly beau's account of a\nfishing-trip he hadn't quite got around to taking--slipped into a chair\nbeside him and begged, \"Are they looking out for you, Milt?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, thank you.\"\n\n\"You haven't been to see me.\"\n\n\"Oh no, but---- Working so darn hard.\"\n\n\"What a strikingly original reason! But have you really?\"\n\n\"Honest.\"\n\nSuddenly he wanted--eternal man, forever playing confidential small boy\nto the beloved--to tell her about his classes and acquaintances; to get\npity for his bare room and his home-cooking. But round them blared the\nbrazen interest in kidneys, and as Claire glanced up with much\nbrightness at another arrival, Milt lost momentum, and found that there\nwas absolutely nothing in the world he could say to her.\n\nHe made a grateful farewell to the omelets and kidneys, and escaped.\n\nHe walked many miles that day, trying to remember how Claire looked.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE VICIOUSNESS OF NICE THINGS\n\n\n\"What did you think of my nice Daggett boy?\" Claire demanded of Eva\nGilson, the moment bruncheon was over.\n\n\"Which one was---- Oh, the boy you met on the road? Why, really, I\ndidn't notice him particularly. I'd rather fancied from the way you\nreferred to him that he was awfully jolly and forceful, but rather\ncrude. But I didn't notice him at all. He seemed perfectly well-bred,\nbut slightly heavy.\"\n\n\"No, he isn't that---- He---- Why did you lead spades?\" reflected\nClaire.\n\nThey were in the drawing-room, resting after the tact and tumult of the\nbruncheon. Claire had been here long enough now for the Gilsons to\nforget her comfortably, and be affectionate and quarrelsome and natural,\nand to admit by their worrying that even in their exalted social\nposition there were things to fuss about.\n\n\"I do think we ought to have invited Belle Torrens,\" fretted Mrs.\nGilson. \"We've simply got to have her here soon.\"\n\nMr. Gilson speculated intensely, \"But she's the dullest soul on earth,\nand her husband spends all his spare time in trying to think up ways of\ndoing me dirt in business. Oh, by the way, did you get the water tap in\nthe blue room fixed? It's dripping all the time.\"\n\n\"No, I forgot it.\"\n\n\"Well, I _do_ wish you'd have it attended to. It simply drips all the\ntime.\"\n\n\"I know. I intended to 'phone the plumber---- Can't you 'phone him\ntomorrow, from the office?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't time to bother with it. But I do wish you would. It keeps\non dripping----\"\n\n\"I know, it doesn't seem to stop. Well, you remind me of it in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I'll forget. You better make a note of it. If it keeps on\ndripping that way, it's likely to injure something. And I do wish you'd\ntell the Jap not to put so much parsley in the omelet. And I say, how\nwould an omelet be with a butter sauce over it?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I don't think so. An omelet ought to be nice and dry. Butter\nmakes it so greasy--besides, with the price of butter----\"\n\n\"But there's a richness to butter---- You'd better make a note about the\ntap dripping in the blue room right now, before you forget it. Oh! Why\nin heaven's name did we have Johnny Martin here? He's dull as\nditchwater----\"\n\n\"I know, but---- It is nice to go out to his place on the Point. Oh,\nGene, I do wish you'd try and remember not to talk about your business\nso much. You and Mr. Martin were talking about the price of lumber for\nat least half an hour----\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. We scarcely mentioned it. Oh! What car are you\ngoing to use this afternoon? If we get out to the Barnetts', I thought\nwe might use the limousine---- Or no, you'll probably go out before I\ndo, I have to read over some specifications, and I promised to give Will\na lift, couldn't you take the Loco, maybe you might drive yourself, no,\nI forgot, the clutch is slipping a little, well, you might drive out and\nsend the car back for me--still, there wouldn't hardly be time----\"\n\nListening to them as to a play, Claire suddenly desired to scream, \"Oh,\nfor heaven's sake quit fussing! I'm going up and drown myself in the\nblue-room tap! What does it matter! Walk! Take a surface car! Don't fuss\nso!\"\n\nHer wrath came from her feeling of guilt. Yes, Milt had been\ncommonplace. Had she done this to him? Had she turned his cheerful\nignorances into a careful stupor? And she felt stuffy and choking and\noverpacked with food. She wanted to be out on the road, clear-headed,\nforcing her way through, an independent human being--with Milt not too\nfar behind.\n\nMrs. Gilson was droning, \"I do think Mattie Vincent is so nice.\"\n\n\"Rather dull I'd call her,\" yawned Mr. Gilson.\n\nMattie was the seventh of their recent guests whom he had called dull by\nnow.\n\n\"Not at all--oh, of course she doesn't dance on tables and quote\nMaeterlinck, but she does have an instinct for the niceties and the\nproprieties--her little house is so sweet--everything just exactly\nright--it may be only a single rose, but always chosen so carefully to\nmelt into the background; and such adorable china--I simply die of envy\nevery time I see her Lowestoft plates. And such a quiet way of reproving\nany bad taste--the time that crank university professor was out there,\nand spoke of the radical labor movement, and Mattie just smiled at him\nand said, 'If you don't mind, let's not drag filthy lumberjacks into the\ndrawing-room--they'd hate it just as much as we would, don't you think,\nperhaps?'\"\n\n\"Oh, _damn_ nice china! Oh, let's hang all spinsters who are brightly\nreproving,\" Claire was silently raging. \"And particularly and earnestly\nconfound all nicety and discretion of living.\"\n\nShe tried to break the spell of the Gilsons' fussing. She\nfalse-heartedly fawned upon Mr. Gilson, and inquired:\n\n\"Is there anything very exciting going on at the mills, Gene?\"\n\n\"Exciting?\" asked Mr. Gilson incredulously. \"Why, how do you mean?\"\n\n\"Don't you find business exciting? Why do you do it then?\"\n\n\"Oh, wellllll---- Of course---- Oh, yes, exciting in a way. Well----\nWell, we've had a jolly interesting time making staves for candy\npails--promises to be wonderfully profitable. We have a new way of\ncutting them. But you wouldn't be interested in the machinery.\"\n\n\"Of course not. You don't bore Eva with your horrid, headachy\nbusiness-problems, do you?\" Claire cooed, with low cunning.\n\n\"Indeed no. Don't think a chap ought to inflict his business on his\nwife. The home should be a place of peace.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Claire.\n\nBut she wasn't thinking \"Yes.\" She was thinking, \"Milt, what worries me\nnow isn't how I can risk letting the 'nice people' meet you. It's how I\ncan ever waste you on the 'nice people.' Oh, I'm spoiled for\ncut-glass-and-velvet afternoons. Eternal spiritual agony over blue-room\ntaps is too high a price even for four-poster beds. I want to be\ndriving! hiking! living!\"\n\nThat afternoon, after having agreed that Mr. Johnny Martin was a bore,\nMr. and Mrs. Gilson decided to run out to the house of Mr. Johnny\nMartin. They bore along the lifeless Claire.\n\nMr. Martin was an unentertaining bachelor who entertained. There were a\ndozen supercilious young married people at his bayside cottage when the\nGilsons arrived. Among them were two eyebrow-arching young matrons whom\nClaire had not met--Mrs. Corey and Mrs. Betz.\n\n\"We've all heard of you, Miss Boltwood,\" said Mrs. Betz. \"You come from\nthe East, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" fluttered Claire, trying to be cordial.\n\nMrs. Corey and Mrs. Betz looked at each other in a motionless wink, and\nMrs. Corey prodded:\n\n\"From New York?\"\n\n\"No. Brooklyn.\" Claire tried not to make it too short.\n\n\"Oh.\" The tacit wink was repeated. Mrs. Corey said brightly--much too\nbrightly--\"I was born in New York. I wonder if you know the Dudenants?\"\n\nNow Claire knew the Dudenants. She had danced with that young ass Don\nDudenant a dozen times. But the devil did enter into her and possess\nher, and, to Eva Gilson's horror, Claire said stupidly, \"No-o, but I\nthink I've heard of them.\"\n\nThe condemning wink was repeated.\n\n\"I hear you've been doing such interesting things--motoring and\nadventuring--you must have met some terrible people along the way,\"\nfished Mrs. Betz.\n\n\"Yes, everybody does seem to feel that way. But I'm afraid I found them\nterribly nice,\" flared Claire.\n\n\"I always say that common people can be most agreeable,\" Mrs. Corey\npatronized. Before Claire could kill her--there wasn't any homicidal\nweapon in sight except a silver tea-strainer--Mrs. Corey had pirouetted\non, \"Though I do think that we're much too kind to workmen and all--the\nlabor situation is getting to be abominable here in the West, and upon\nmy word, to keep a maid nowadays, you have to treat her as though she\nwere a countess.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't maids be like countesses? They're much more important,\"\nsaid Claire sweetly.\n\nIt cannot be stated that Claire had spent any large part of her time in\nreading Karl Marx, leading syndicalist demonstrations, or hemming red\ninternationalist flags, but at this instant she was a complete\nrevolutionist. She could have executed Mrs. Corey and pretty Mrs. Betz\nwith zeal; she disliked the entire bourgeoisie; she looked around for a\nJap boy to call \"comrade\" and she again thought about the possibilities\nof the tea-strainer for use in assassination. She stolidly wore through\nthe combined and exclamatory explanations of Mrs. Corey, Mrs. Betz, Mrs.\nGilson, and Mr. Johnny Martin about the inherent viciousness of all\nmaids, and when the storm was over, she said in a manner of honey and\nsyrup:\n\n\"You were speaking of the Dudenants, weren't you, Mrs. Corey? I do\nremember them now. Poor Don Dudenant, isn't it a pity he's such a fool?\nHis father is really a very decent old bore.\"\n\n\"I,\" observed Mrs. Corey, in prim horror, \"regard the Dudenants as\nextremely delightful people. I fancy we must be thinking of different\nfamilies. I mean the Manhattan Dudenants, not the Brooklyn family.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I meant the Manhattan family, too--the one that made its\nfortune selling shoddy woolens in the Civil War,\" caressed Claire.\n\nRight there, her welcome by Mrs. Corey and Mrs. Betz ceased; and without\nany of the unhappiness which the thought would have caused her three\nmonths before, Claire reflected, \"How they hate me!\"\n\nThe Gilsons had a number of thoughts upon the subject of tact to express\nto Claire on the way home. But she, who had always smiled, who had been\nthe obedient guest, shrugged and snapped, \"They're idiots, those young\nwomen. They're impertinent shopgirls in good frocks. I like your\nSeattle. It's a glorious city. And I love so many of the fine, simple,\nreal people I've met here. I admire your progress. I do know how\nmiraculously you've changed it from a mining camp. But for heaven's sake\ndon't forget the good common hardiness of the miners. Somehow, London\nsocial distinctions seem ludicrous in American cities that twenty years\nago didn't have much but board sidewalks and saloons. I don't care\nwhether it's Seattle or Minneapolis or Omaha or Denver, I refuse to\nworry about the Duchess of Corey and the Baroness Betz and all the other\nwonderful imitations of gilt. When a pair of finishing-school flappers\nlike Betz and Corey try to impress me with their superiority to workmen,\nand their extreme aristocracy and Easternness, they make me tired. I\n_am_ the East!\"\n\nShe had made peace with the Gilsons by night; she had been reasonably\nrepentant about not playing the game of her hosts; but inside her eager\nheart she snuggled a warm thought. She remembered how gaily she had once\npromised, out on the road, to come to Milt's room and cook for him. She\nthought of it with homesick desire. His room probably wasn't\nparticularly decorative, and she doubted his having an electric range,\nbut it would be fun to fry eggs again, to see him fumbling with the\ndish-washing, to chatter and plan golden futures, and not worry about\nthe opinions of Mrs. Corey and Mrs. Betz.\n\nThe next afternoon the limousine was not busy and she borrowed it, with\nthe handsome Greek chauffeur.\n\nShe gave him an address not far from the university.\n\nHe complained, \"Pardon me, miss, but I think you have the wrong number.\nThat block is a low quarter.\"\n\n\"Probably! But that's the right number!\"\n\nHe raised his Athenian eyebrows, and she realized what a mistake she had\nmade in not bringing the lethal tea-strainer along. When they had\nstopped in front of a cheap candy-store, he opened the door of the car\nwith such frigid reserve that she thought seriously about slapping him.\n\nShe climbed the stingy, flapping stairs, and knocked at the first door\nin the upper hall. It was opened by a large apron, to which a sleepy\nwoman was an unimportant attachment, and out of the mass of apron and\nwoman came a yawning, \"Mr. Daggett's room is down the hall on the\nright.\"\n\nClaire knocked at a door which had at various epochs been blue, yellow,\nand pink, and now was all three. No answer. She tried the knob, went in.\n\nShe could not tell whether it was the barrenness of the room, or Milt's\ncarefulness, that caught her. The uncarpeted boards of the floor were\nwell swept. He had only one plate, one spoon, but they were scoured, and\nput away on newspaper-covered shelves in a cupboard made of a soap-box.\nBehind a calico curtain was his new suit, dismayingly neat on its\nhanger. On the edge of the iron sink primly washed and spread out to\ndry, was a tattered old rag. At the sight of it, at the thought of Milt\nsolemnly washing dishes, the tears began to creep to her eyes.\n\nThere was but one picture in the room--a half-tone of a girl, clipped\nfrom a magazine devoted to actresses. The name was cut off. As she\nwondered at it, Claire saw that the actress was very much like herself.\n\nThe only other ornament was a papier-m\u00c3\u00a2ch\u00c3\u00a9 figure of a cat, a cat\nreminiscent of the Lady Vere de Vere. Claire picked it up. On the\nbottom was the price-mark--three cents.\n\nIt was the price-mark that pierced her. She flung across the room,\ndropped on his creaky cot-bed, howled, \"Oh, I've been a beast--a\nbeast--a beast! All the pretty things--limousines and marble\nbaths--thinking so much of them, and not wanting them for _him_! And he\nwith so little, with just nothing--he that would appreciate jolly things\nso much--here in this den, and making it as tolerable as he can--and me\nhalf ashamed of him instead of fighting for him---- I belong with Corey\nand Betz. Oh, I'm so ashamed, so bitterly ashamed.\"\n\nShe patted his bed smooth with nervous eager fingers.\n\nShe scraped a pin-point of egg-yolk off a platter.\n\nBefore she had been home five minutes she had written a note asking him\nto tea for next day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nTHE MORNING COAT OF MR. HUDSON B. RIGGS\n\n\nMr. Hudson B. Riggs now enters the tale--somewhat tardily, and making a\nquick exit, all in a morning coat too tight about the shoulders, and a\nsmile of festivity too tight about the lips. He looked as improbable as\nan undertaker's rubber-plant. Yet in his brief course he had a mighty\neffect upon the progress of civilization as exemplified in the social\ncareer of Mr. Milton Daggett.\n\nMr. Riggs had arrived at a golden position in Alaskan mining engineering\nby way of the farm, the section gang, the surveyor's chain, and\nprospecting; and his thick hands showed his evolution. His purpose in\nlife was to please Mrs. Riggs, and he wasn't ever going to achieve his\npurpose in life. She wore spangles, and her corsets creaked, and she\nsmiled nervously, and could tell in a glance quicker than the 1\/100\nkodak shutter whether or not a new acquaintance was \"worth cultivating.\"\nShe had made Mr. Riggs thoroughly safe and thoroughly unhappy in the\npursuit of society. He stood about keeping from doing anything he might\nwant to, and he was profusely polite to young cubs whom he longed to\nhave in his office--so that he could get even with them.\n\nWhat Mr. Riggs wanted to do, at the third large tea given by Mrs. Gilson\nfor Miss Claire Boltwood, was to sneak out on the sun-porch and play\nover the new records on the phonograph; but the things he had heard from\nMrs. Riggs the last time he'd done that had convinced him that it was\nnot a wise method of escape. So he stood by the fireplace--safe on one\nside at least--and ate lettuce sandwiches, which he privately called\n\"cow feed,\" and listened to a shining, largely feminine crowd rapidly\nuttering unintelligible epigrams from which he caught only the words,\n\"Ripping hand--trained nurse--whipcord--really worth seeing--lost the\nball near the second hole--most absurd person--new maid--thanks so\nmuch.\" He was hoping that some one would come around and let him be\nagreeable. He knew that he stood the ride home with Mrs. Riggs much\nbetter after he had been agreeable to people he didn't like.\n\nWhat Mr. Riggs did not know was that a young man in uninteresting blue,\nwho looked like a good tennis-player, was watching him. It wasn't\nbecause he detected a fellow soul in purgatory but because he always was\nobsequious outside of his office that Mr. Riggs bowed so profusely that\nhe almost lost his tea-cup, when the young man in blue drifted to him\nand suggested, \"I hear you're in the Alaskan mining-game, Mr. Riggs.\"\n\n\"Oh yes.\"\n\n\"Do you get up there much now?\"\n\n\"No, not much.\"\n\n\"I hope to hit Alaska some day--I'm taking engineering at the U.\"\n\n\"Do you? Straight?\" Mr. Riggs violently set his cup down on a\ntable--Mrs. Riggs would later tell him that he'd put it down in the\nwrong place, but never mind. He leaned over Milt and snarled, \"Offer me\na cigarette. I don't know if they smoke here, and I dassn't be the first\nto try. Say, boy, Alaska---- I wish I was there now! Say, it beats all\nhell how good tea can taste in a tin cup, and how wishy-washy it is in\nchina. Boy, I don't know anything about you, but you look all right, and\nwhen you get ready to go to Alaska, you come to me, and I'll see if I\ncan't give you a chance to go up there. But don't ever come back!\"\n\nWhen the crowd began bubblingly to move toward the door, Milt prepared\nto move--and bubble--with them. Though Claire's note had sounded as\nthough she was really a little lonely, at the tea she had said nothing\nto him except, \"So glad you came. Do you know Dolly Ransome? Dolly, this\nis my nice Mr. Daggett. Take him and make him happy.\"\n\nDolly hadn't made him in the least happy. She had talked about tennis;\nshe had with some detail described her remarkable luck in beating one\nSally Saunders three sets. Now Milt was learning tennis. He was at the\npresent period giving two hours a week to tennis, two to dancing, two to\nbridge. But he preferred cleaning oil-wells to any of these toilsome\naccomplishments, and it must sadly be admitted that all the while he was\nmaking his face bright at Dolly, he was wondering what would happen if\nhe interrupted Dolly's gurgling, galloping, giggling multitudinousness\nby shouting, \"Oh, shut up!\"\n\nWhen it seemed safe to go, and he tried to look as though he too were\noozing out to a Crane-Simplex, Claire slipped beside him, soft as a\nshadow, and whispered, \"Please don't go. I want to talk to you.\n_Please!_\" There was fluttering wistfulness in her voice, though\ninstantly it was gone as she hastened to the door and was to be heard\nasserting that she did indeed love Seattle.\n\nMilt looked out into the hall. He studied a console with a curious black\nand white vase containing a single peacock feather, and a gold mirror\nshimmering against a gray wall.\n\n\"Lovely stuff. I like that mirror. Like a slew in the evening. But it\nisn't worth being a slave for. I'm not going to be a Mr. Riggs. Poor\ndevil, he's more of a servant than any of these maids. Certainly am\nsorry for that poor fish. He'll have a chance to take his coat off and\nsit down and smoke--when he's dead!\"\n\nThe guests were gone; the Gilsons upstairs. Claire came running, seized\nMilt's sleeve, coaxed him to the davenport in the drawing-room--then\nsighed, and rubbed her forehead, and looked so tired that he could say\nnothing but, \"Hope you haven't been overdoing.\"\n\n\"No, just--just talking too much.\"\n\nHe got himself to say, \"Miss Ransome--the one that's nuts about\ntennis--she's darn nice.\"\n\n\"Is she?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's--she's---- What do you hear from your father?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's back at work.\"\n\n\"Trip do him good?\"\n\n\"Oh, a lot.\"\n\n\"Did he----\"\n\n\"Milt! Tell me about you. What are you doing? What are you studying? How\ndo you live? Do you really cook your own meals? Do you begin to get your\nteeth into the engineering? Oh, do tell me everything. I want to know,\nso much!\"\n\n\"There isn't a whole lot to tell. Mostly I'm getting back into math.\nBeen out of touch with it. I find that I know more about motors than\nmost of the fellows. That helps. And about living--oh, I keep\nconservative. Did you know I'd sold my garage?\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't, I didn't!\"\n\nHe wondered why she said it with such stooping shame, but he went on\nmildly, \"Well, I got a pretty good price, but of course I don't want to\ntake any chances on running short of coin, so I'm not splurging much.\nAnd----\" He looked at his nails, and whistled a bar or two, and turned\nhis head away, and looked back with a shy, \"And I'm learning to play\nbridge and tennis and stuff!\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" It was a cry of pain. She beat her hands for a moment\nbefore she murmured, \"When are we going to have our lessons in\ndancing--and in making an impression on sun-specks like Dolly Ransome?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he parried. Then, looking at her honestly, he confessed,\n\"I don't believe we're ever going to. Claire, I can't do it. I'm no good\nfor this tea game. You know how clumsy I was. I spilled some tea, and I\ndarn near tripped over some woman's dress and---- Oh, I'm not afraid of\nthem. Now that I get a good close look at this bunch, they seem pretty\nmuch like other folks, except maybe that one old dame says 'cawn't.' But\nI can't do the manners stunt. I can't get myself to give enough thought\nto how you ought to hold a tea-cup.\"\n\n\"Oh, those things don't matter--they don't _matter_! Besides, everybody\nlikes you--only you're so terribly cautious that you never let them see\nthe force and courage and all that wonderful sweet dear goodness that's\nin you. And as for your manners--heaven knows I'm no P. G. Wodehouse\nvalet. But I'll teach you all I know.\"\n\n\"Claire, I appreciate it a lot but---- I'm not so darn sure I want to\nlearn. I'm getting scared. I watched that bird named Riggs here today.\nHe's a regular fellow, or he was, but now he's simply lost in the\nshuffle. I don't want to be one of the million ghosts in a city. Seattle\nis bad enough--it's so big that I feel like a no-see-um in a Norway pine\nreserve. But New York would be a lot worse. I don't want to be a Mr.\nRiggs.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--I'm not a Mrs. Riggs!\"\n\n\"What do you----\"\n\nHe did not finish asking her what she meant. She was in his arms; she\nwas whispering, \"My heart is so lonely;\" and the room was still. The low\nsun flooded the windows, swam in the mirror in the hall, but they did\nnot heed, did not see its gliding glory.\n\nNot till there was a sound of footsteps did she burst from his arms,\nspring to her reflection in the glass of a picture, and shamefacedly\nmurmur to him over her shoulder, \"My hair--it's a terrible giveaway!\"\n\nHe had followed her; he stood with his arm circling her shoulder.\n\nShe begged, \"No. Please no. I'm frightened. Let's--oh, let's have a walk\nor something before you scamper home.\"\n\n\"Look! My dear! Let's run away, and explore the town, and not come back\ntill late evening.\"\n\n\"Yes. Let's.\"\n\nThey walked from Queen Anne Hill through the city to the docks. There\nwas nothing in their excited, childish, \"Oh, see that!\" and \"There's a\ndandy car!\" and \"Ohhhhh, that's a Minnesota license--wonder who it is?\"\nto confess that they had been so closely, so hungrily together.\n\nThey swung along a high walk overlooking the city wharf. They saw a\nsteamer loading rails and food for the government railroad in Alaska.\nThey exclaimed over a nest of little, tarry fishing-boats. They watched\nmen working late to unload Alaska salmon.\n\nThey crossed the city to Jap Town and its writhing streets, its dark\nalleys and stairways lost up the hillsides. They smiled at black-eyed\nchildren, and found a Japanese restaurant, and tried to dine on raw fish\nand huge shrimps and roots soaked in a very fair grade of light-medium\nmotor oil.\n\nWith Milt for guide, Claire discovered a Christianity that was not of\ncandles and shifting lights and insinuating music, nor of carpets and\nlarge pews and sound oratory, but of hoboes blinking in rows, and girls\nin gospel bonnets, and little silver and crimson placards of Bible\ntexts. They stopped on a corner to listen to a Pentecostal brother, to\nan I. W. W. speaker, to a magnificent negro who boomed in an operatic\nbaritone that the Day of Judgment was coming on April 11, 1923, at three\nin the morning.\n\nIn the streets of Jap Town, in cheap motion-picture theaters, in hotels\nfor transient workmen, she found life, running swift and eager and\nmany-colored; and it seemed to her that back in the house of\nfour-posters and walls of subdued gray, life was smothered in the very\nbest pink cotton-batting. Milt's delight in every picturesque dark\ncorner, and the colloquial eloquence of the street-orators, stirred her.\nAnd when she saw a shopgirl caress the hand of a slouching beau in\nthreadbare brown, her own hand slipped into Milt's and clung there.\n\nBut they came shyly up to the Gilson hedge, and when Milt chuckled,\n\"Bully walk; let's do it again,\" she said only, \"Oh, yes, I did like it.\nVery much.\"\n\nHe had abruptly dropped his beautiful new felt hat. He was clutching her\narms, demanding, \"Can you like me? Oh my God, Claire, I can't play at\nlove. I'm mad--I just live in you. You're my blood and soul. Can I\nbecome--the kind of man you like?\"\n\n\"My dear!\" She was fiercely addressing not him alone but the Betzes and\nCoreys and Gilsons and Jeff Saxtons, \"don't you forget for one moment\nthat all these people--here or Brooklyn either--that seem so aloof and\namused, are secretly just plain people with enamel on, and you're to\nhave the very best enamel, if it's worth while. I'm not sure that it\nis----\"\n\n\"You're going to kiss me!\"\n\n\"No! Please no! I don't--I don't understand us, even now. Can't we be\njust playmates a while yet? But--I do like you!\"\n\nShe fled. When she reached the hall she found her eyelids wet.\n\nIt was the next afternoon----\n\nClaire was curled on the embroidered linen counterpane of her bed,\nthinking about chocolates and Brooklyn and driving through Yellowstone\nPark and corn fritters and satin petticoats versus _cr\u00c3\u00aape de chine_ and\nMount Rainier and Milt and spiritualism and manicuring, when Mrs. Gilson\nprowled into her room and demanded \"Busy?\" so casually that Claire was\nsuspicious.\n\n\"No. Not very. Something up?\"\n\n\"A nice party. Come down and meet an amusing man from Alaska.\"\n\nClaire took her time powdering her nose, and ambled downstairs and into\nthe drawing-room, to find----\n\nJeff Saxton, Mr. Geoffrey Saxton, who is the height of Brooklyn Heights,\nstanding by the fireplace, smiling at her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nTHE ENEMY LOVE\n\n\nBut at second glance--was it Jeff? This man was tanned to a thick even\nbrown in which his eyes were startlingly white. His hands were burned\nred; there was a scar across one of them; and he was standing with them\ncockily at his hips, all unlike the sleekly, noisily quiet Jeff of\nBrooklyn. He was in corduroy trousers and belted corduroy jacket, with a\nkhaki-colored flannel shirt.\n\nBut his tranquilly commanding smile was Jeff's, and his lean grace; and\nJeff's familiar amused voice greeted her paralyzed amazement with:\n\n\"Hello, pard! Ain't I met you some place in Montana?\"\n\n\"Well--where--in--the----\"\n\n\"Just landed from Alaska. Had to run up there from California. How are\nyou, little princess?\"\n\nHis hand was out to her, then both hands, beseechingly, but she did not\nrun to him, as she had at Flathead Lake. She stalked him cautiously, and\nshook hands--much too heartily. She sought cover in the wing-chair\nand--much too cordially--she invited:\n\n\"Tell me all about it.\"\n\nHe was watching her. Already his old pursuing determination, his steady\ndignity, were beginning to frighten her. But he calmly dropped into a\nstraight chair, and obliged:\n\n\"It's really been quite a lively journey. Didn't know I could like\nroughing-it so well. And it was real roughing-it, pretty much. Oh, not\ndangerous at all, but rather vigorous. I had to canoe up three hundred\nmiles of a shallow river, with one Indian guide, making a portage every\nten miles or so, and we got tipped over in the rapids now and then--the\nBig Chief almost got drowned once--and we camped at night in the\noriginal place where they invented mosquitoes--and one morning I shot a\nblack bear just in time to keep him from eating my boots.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she sighed in admiration, and \"Oh!\" again, uneasily.\n\nNothing had been said about it; Jeff was the last person in the world to\nspoil his triumph by commenting on it; but both of them knew that they\nhad violently changed places; that now it was she who was the limp\nindoor-dweller, and he who was the ruddy ranger; that as he had admired\nher at Flathead Lake, so now it was hers to admire, and his to be\nserenely heroic.\n\nShe was not far from the worshiping sub-deb in her sighing, \"How _did_\nyou get the scar?\"\n\n\"That? Oh, nothing.\"\n\n\"Please tell me.\"\n\n\"Really and truly. Nothing at all. Just a drunken fellow with a knife,\nplaying the fool. I didn't have to touch him--quite sure he could have\ngiven me a frightful beating and all that sort of thing. It was the Big\nChief who got rid of him.\"\n\n\"He--cut you? With a kniiiiiife? Ohhhhhhh!\"\n\nShe ran to him, pityingly stroked the scar, looked down at him with\nfilmy eyes. Then she tried to retreat, but he retained her hand, glanced\nup at her as though he knew her every thought. She felt weak. How could\nshe escape him? \"Please!\" she begged flutteringly.\n\nIf he held her hand another moment, she trembled, she'd be on his lap,\nin his arms--lost. And he was holding it. He was----\n\nOh, he was too old for her. Yes, and too paternal. But still---- Life\nwith Jeff would be protected, kindly, honorable.\n\nYet all the time she wanted, and stormily knew she wanted, to be fleeing\nto the boy Milt, her mate; to run away with him, hand in hand,\ndiscovering all the colored world, laughing at life, not afraid of\nlosing dignity. In fear of Jeff's very kindliness and honor, she jerked\nher hand free. Then she tried to smile like a clever fencer.\n\nAs she retreated to her chair she stammered, \"Did you---- Was Alaska\ninteresting?\"\n\nHe did not let her go, this time. Easy, cat-like for all his dry\ngravity, he sauntered after her, and with a fine high seriousness\npleaded his case:\n\n\"Claire dear, those few weeks of fighting nature were a revelation to\nme. I'm going to have lots more of it. As it happens, they need me\nthere. There's plenty of copper, but there's big transportation and\nemployment problems that I seem better able to solve than the other\nchaps--though of course I'm an absolute muff when it comes to\nengineering problems. But I've had certain training and--I'm going to\narrange things so that I get up there at least once a year. Next summer\nI'll make a much longer trip--see the mountains--oh, glorious\nmountains--and funny half-Russian towns, and have some fishing----\nWandering. The really big thing. Even finer than your superb plucky trip\nthrough----\"\n\n\"Wasn't plucky! I'm a cry baby,\" she said, like a bad, contradictory\nlittle girl.\n\nHe didn't argue it. He smiled and said \"Tut!\" and placidly catalogued\nher with, \"You're the pluckiest girl I've ever seen, and it's all the\nmore amazing because you're not a motion-picture Tomboy, but essentially\nexquisite----\"\n\n\"I'm a grub.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. You're a grub. So am I. And I like it. And when I make\nthe big Alaskan trip next year I want you to go along! Claire! Haven't\nyou any idea how terribly close to me the thought of you has been these\nweeks? You've guided me through the wilderness----\"\n\n\"It's---- I'm glad.\" She sprang up, beseeching, \"Jeff dear, you're going\nto stay for tea? I must run up and powder my nose.\"\n\n\"Not until you say you're glad to see me. Child dear, we've been ambling\nalong and---- No. You aren't a child any more. You're a woman. And if\nI've never been quite a man, but just a dusty office-machine, that's\ngone now. I've got the wind of the wilderness in my lungs. Man and\nwoman! My woman! That's all I'm going to say now, but---- Oh my God,\nClaire, I do need you so!\"\n\nHe drew her head to his shoulder, and for an instant she rested there.\nBut as she looked up, she saw coming age in the granulated skin of his\nthroat.\n\n\"He needs me--but he'd boss me. I'd be the cunning child-wife, even at\nfifty,\" she worried, and \"Hang him, it's like his superiority to beat\npoor Milt even at adventuring--and to be such a confounded Modest\nChristian Gentleman about it!\"\n\n\"You'd--you're so dreadfully managing,\" she sighed aloud.\n\nFor the first time in all their acquaintanceship, Jeff's pride broke,\nand he held her away from him, while his lips were pathetic, and he\nmourned, \"Why do you always try to hurt me?\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear, I don't.\"\n\n\"Is it because you resent the decent things I have managed to do?\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"If I have an idea for a party, you think I'm 'managing.' If I think\nthings out deeply, you say I'm dull.\"\n\n\"Oh, you aren't. I didn't mean----\"\n\n\"What are you? A real woman, or one of these flirts, that love to tease\na man because he's foolish enough to be honestly in love?\"\n\n\"I'm not--hon-estly I'm not, Jeff. It's---- You don't quite make me----\nIt's just that I'm not in love with you. I like you, and respect you\nterribly, but----\"\n\n\"I'm going to make you love me.\" His clutching fingers hurt her arm, and\nsomehow she was not angry, but stirred. \"But I'm not going to try now.\nForget the Alaskan caveman. Remember, I haven't even used the word\n'love.' I've just chatted about fjords, or whatever they are, but one of\nthese days---- No. I won't do it. I want to stay here in Seattle a few\ndays, and take you on jolly picnics, but---- Would you rather I didn't\neven do that? I'm----\" He dropped her arm, kneaded his forehead with the\nheel of his palm. \"I can't stand being regarded as a bothersome puppy. I\ncan't stand it! I can't!\"\n\n\"Please stay, Jeff! We'll have some darling drives and things. We'll go\nup Rainier as far as we can.\"\n\nHe stayed. He was anecdotal and amusing at tea, that afternoon. Claire\nsaw how the Gilsons, and two girls who dropped in, admired him. That\nmade her uneasy. And when Mrs. Gilson begged him to leave his hotel and\nstay with them, he refused with a quick look at Claire that hurt her.\n\n\"He wants me to be free. He's really so much more considerate than Milt.\nAnd I hurt him. Even his pride broke down. And I've spoiled Milt's life\nby meddling. And I've hurt the Gilsons' feelings. And I'm not much of a\ncomfort to father. Oh, I'm absolutely no good,\" she agonized.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nTHE VIRTUOUS PLOTTERS\n\n\nMr. Geoffrey Saxton, in Alaskan tan and New York evening clothes and\nPiccadilly poise, was talking to the Eugene Gilsons while Claire\nfinished dressing for the theater.\n\nMrs. Gilson observed, \"She's the dearest thing. We've become awfully\nfond of her. But I don't think she knows what she wants to do with life.\nShe's rather at loose ends. Who is this Daggett boy--some university\nstudent--whom she seems to like?\"\n\n\"Well, since you speak of him---- I hadn't meant to, unless you did. I\nwant to be fair to him. What did she tell you about him?\" Jeff asked\nconfidentially.\n\n\"Nothing, except that he's a young engineer, and frightfully brave and\nall those uncomfortable virtues, and she met him in Yellowstone Park or\nsomewhere, and he saved her from a bear--or was it a tramp?--from\nsomething unnecessary, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Eva, I don't want to be supercilious, but the truth is that this young\nDaggett is a rather dreadful person. He's been here at the house, hasn't\nhe? How did he strike you?\"\n\n\"Not at all. He's silent, and as dull as lukewarm tea, but perfectly\ninoffensive.\"\n\n\"Then he's cleverer than I thought! Daggett is anything but dull and\ninoffensive, and if he can play that estimable r\u00c3\u00b4le----! It seems that\nhe is the son of some common workman in the Middlewest; he isn't an\nengineer at all; he's really a chauffeur or a taxi-driver or something;\nand he ran into Claire and Henry B. on the road, and somehow insinuated\nhimself into their graces--far from being silent and commonplace, he\nappears to have some strange kind of charm which,\" Jeff sighed, \"I don't\nunderstand at all. I simply don't understand it!\n\n\"I met him in Montana with the most gorgeously atrocious person I've\never encountered--one Pinky Westlake, or some such a name--positively, a\ncrook! He tried to get Boltwood and myself interested in the commonest\nkind of a mining swindle--hinted that we were to join him in cheating\nthe public. And this Daggett was his partner--they actually traveled\ntogether. But I do want to be just. I'm not _sure_ that Daggett was\naware of his partner's dishonesty. That isn't what worries me about the\nlad. It's his utter impossibility. He's as crude as iron-ore. When he's\nbeing careful, he may manage to be inconspicuous, but give him the\nchance----\n\n\"Really, I'm not exaggerating when I say that at thirty-five he'll be\ndining in his shirt-sleeves, and sitting down to read the paper with his\nshoes off and feet up on the table. But Claire--you know what a dear\nQuixotic soul she is--she fancies that because this fellow repaired a\npuncture or something of the sort for her on the road, she's indebted\nto him, and the worse he is, the more she feels that she must help him.\nAnd affairs of that kind---- Oh, it's quite too horrible, but there have\nbeen cases, you know, where girls as splendid and fine and well-bred as\nClaire herself have been trapped into low marriages by their loyalty to\ncadging adventurers!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" groaned Mrs. Gilson; and \"Good Lord!\" lamented Mr. Gilson,\ndelighted by the possibility of tragedy; and \"Really, I'm not\nexaggerating,\" said Jeff enthusiastically.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" demanded Mrs. Gilson; while Mr. Gilson, being\nof a ready and inventive mind, exclaimed, \"By Jove, you ought to kidnap\nher and marry her yourself, Jeff!\"\n\n\"I'd like to. But I'm too old.\"\n\nThey beautifully assured him that he was a blithe young thing with milk\nteeth; and with a certain satisfaction Jeff suggested, \"I tell you what\nwe might do. Of course it's an ancient stunt, but it's good. I judge\nthat Daggett hasn't been here at the house much. Why not have him here\nso often that Claire will awaken to his crudity, and get sick of him?\"\n\n\"We'll do it,\" thrilled Mrs. Gilson. \"We'll have him for everything from\nnine-course dinners with Grandmother Eaton's napkins on view, to milk\nand cold ham out of the ice-box. When Claire doesn't invite him, I\nwill!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nTHE KITCHEN INTIMATE\n\n\nMilt had become used to the Gilson drawing-room. He was no longer\nuncomfortable in the presence of its sleek fatness, though at first (not\nknowing that there were such resources as interior decorators), he had\nbeen convinced that, to have created the room, the Gilsons must have\nknown everything in the world. Now he glanced familiarly at its white\npaneling, its sconces like silver candlesticks, the inevitable davenport\ninevitably backed by an amethyst-shaded piano lamp and a table crowded\nwith silver boxes and picture-frames. He liked the winsomeness of light\nupon velvet and polished wood.\n\nIt was not the drawing-room but the kitchen that dismayed him.\n\nIn Schoenstrom he had known that there must somewhere be beautiful\n\"parlors,\" but he had trusted in his experience of kitchens. Kitchens,\naccording to his philosophy, were small smelly rooms of bare floors, and\nprovided with one oilcloth-covered table, one stove (the front draft\nalways broken and propped up with the lid-lifter), one cupboard with\npanes of tin pierced in rosettes, and one stack of dirty dishes.\n\nBut the Gilson kitchen had the efficiency of a laboratory and the\nsuperciliousness of a hair-dresser's booth. With awe Milt beheld walls\nof white tiles, a cork floor, a gas-range large as a hotel-stove, a\nceiling-high refrigerator of enamel and nickel, zinc-topped tables, and\na case of utensils like a surgeon's knives. It frightened him; it made\nmore hopelessly unapproachable than ever the Alexandrian luxury of the\ngreat Gilsons.... The Vanderbilts' kitchen must be like this. And maybe\nKing George's.\n\nHe was viewing the kitchen upon the occasion of an intimate Sunday\nevening supper to which he had been yearningly invited by Mrs. Gilson.\nThe maids were all out. The Gilsons and Claire, Milt and Jeff Saxton,\nshoutingly prepared their own supper. While Mrs. Gilson scrambled eggs\nand made coffee, the others set the table, and brought cold ham and a\nbowl of salad from the ice-box.\n\nMilt had intended to be a silent but deft servitor. When he had heard\nthat he was to come to supper with the returned Mr. Geoffrey Saxton, he\nhad first been panic-shaken, then resolved. He'd \"let old iron-face\nSaxton do the high and mighty. Let him stand around and show off his\nclothes and adjectives, way he did at Flathead Lake.\" But he, Milt,\nwould be \"on the job.\" He'd help get supper, and calmly ignore Jeff's\nrudeness.\n\nOnly--Jeff wasn't rude. He greeted Milt with, \"Ah, Daggett! This is _so_\nnice!\" And Milt had no chance to help. It was Jeff who anticipated him\nand with a pleasant, \"Let me get that--I'm kitchen-broke,\" snatched up\nthe cold ham and salad. It was Jeff who found the supper plates, while\nMilt was blunderingly wondering how any one family could use a \"whole\nfurniture-store-full of different kinds of china.\" It was Jeff who\nsprang to help Claire wheel in the tea-wagon, and so captured the chance\nto speak to her for which Milt had been maneuvering these five minutes.\n\nWhen they were settled, Jeff glowed at him, and respectfully offered, \"I\nthought of you so often, Daggett, on a recent little jaunt of mine.\nYou'd have been helpful.\"\n\n\"Where was that?\" asked Milt suspiciously (wondering, and waiting to\nsee, whether you could take cold ham in your fingers).\n\n\"Oh, in Alaska.\"\n\n\"In--Alaska?\" Milt was dismayed.\n\n\"Yes, just a business trip there. There's something I wish you'd advise\nme about.\"\n\nHe was humble. And Milt was uneasy. He grumbled, \"What's that?\"\n\n\"I've been wondering whether it would be possible to use wireless\ntelephony in Alaska. But I'm such a dub at electricity. Do you know----\nWhat would be the cost of installing a wireless telephone plant with a\nhundred-mile radius?\"\n\n\"Gee, I don't know!\"\n\n\"Oh, so sorry. Well, I wonder if you can tell me about wireless\ntelegraphy, then?\"\n\n\"No, I don't know anything about that either.\"\n\nMilt had desperately tried to make his answer gracious but somehow----\nHe hated this devil's obsequiousness more than he had his chilliness at\nFlathead Lake. He had a feeling that the Gilsons had delightedly kicked\neach other under the table; that, for all her unchanging smile, Claire\nwas unhappy.... And she was so far off, a white wraith floating beyond\nhis frantic grasp.\n\n\"It doesn't matter, really. But I didn't know---- So you've started in\nthe engineering school at the University of Washington,\" Saxton was\npurring. \"Have you met Gid Childers there--son of old Senator\nChilders--charming people.\"\n\n\"I've seen him. He has a Stutz--no, his is the Mercer,\" sighed Milt.\n\nHe hated himself for it, but he couldn't quite keep the awe out of his\nvoice. People with Mercers----\n\nClaire seemed to be trying to speak. She made a delicate, feminine,\nclairesque approximation to clearing her throat. But Jeff ignored her\nand with almost osculatory affection continued to Milt:\n\n\"Do let me know if there's anything I can do to help you. We're\nacquainted with two or three of your engineering faculty at the Office.\nThey write in about various things. Do you happen to know Dr.\nPhilgren?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. Say! He's a wonder!\" Milt was betrayed into exclaiming.\n\n\"Yes. Good chap, I believe. He's been trying to get a job with us. We\nmay give him one. Just tell him you're a friend of mine, and that he's\nto give you any help he can.\"\n\nMilt choked on a \"Thanks.\"\n\n\"And--now that we're just the family here together--how goes the\nfinancial side? Can I be of any assistance in introducing you to some\nengineering firm where you could do a little work on the side? You could\nmake quite a little money----\"\n\nSo confoundedly affectionate and paternal----\n\nMilt said irritably, \"Thanks, but I don't need to do any work. I've got\nplenty of money.\"\n\n\"How pleasant!\" Saxton's voice was smooth as marshmallow. \"You're\nfortunate. I had quite a struggle to get through Princeton.\"\n\nWasn't Mr. Gilson contrasting Saxton's silk shirt with Milt's darned\ncotton covering, and in light of that contrast chuckling at Milt's boast\nand Saxton's modesty? Milt became overheated. His scalp prickled and his\nshoulder-blades were damp. As Saxton turned from him, and crooned to\nClaire, \"More ham, honey?\" Milt hated himself. He was in much of the\ndramatic but undesirable position of a man in pajamas, not very good\npajamas, who has been locked out in the hotel corridor by the slamming\nof his door. He was in the frame of mind of a mongrel, of a real\nBoys'-Dog, at a Madison Square dog-show. He had a faint shrewd suspicion\nof Saxton's game. But what could he do about it?\n\nHe felt even more out of place when the family forgot him and talked\nabout people of whom he had never heard.\n\nHe sat alone on an extremely distant desert isle and ate cold ham and\nwished he were in Schoenstrom.\n\nClaire had recovered her power of speech. She seemed to be trying to\nbring him into the conversation, so that the family might appreciate\nhim.\n\nShe hesitated, and thought with creased brows, and brought out, \"Uh, uh,\noh---- Oh Milt: How much is gas selling at now?\"...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMilt left that charming and intimate supper-party at nine. He said, \"Got\nto work on--on my analytical geometry,\" as though it was a lie; and he\nthrew \"Good night\" at Saxton as though he hated his kind, good\nbenefactor; and when he tried to be gracious to Mrs. Gilson the best he\ncould get out was, \"Thanks f' inviting me.\" They expansively saw him to\nthe door. Just as he thought that he had escaped, Saxton begged, \"Oh,\nDaggett, I was arguing with a chap---- What color are Holstein-Friesian\ncattle? Red?\"\n\n\"Black and white,\" Milt said eagerly.\n\nHe heard Mrs. Gilson giggle.\n\nHe stood on the terrace wiping his forehead and, without the least\nstruggle, finally and irretrievably admitting that he would never see\nClaire Boltwood or any of her friends again. Not--never!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had received from Mrs. Gilson a note inviting him to share their box\nat the first night of a three-night Opera Season. He had spent half a\nday in trying to think of a courteously rude way of declining.\n\nA straggly little girl came up from the candy-shop below his room,\ndemanding, \"Say, are you Mr. Daggett? Say, there's some woman wants to\ntalk to you on our telephone. Say, tell them we ain't supposed to be no\nmessenger-office. You ain't supposed to call no upstairs people on our\ntelephone. We ain't supposed to leave the store and go trotting all over\ntown to---- Gee, a nickel, gee, thank you, don't mind what ma says,\nshe's always kicking.\"\n\nOn the telephone, he heard Claire's voice in an agitated, \"Milt! Meet me\ndown-town, at the Imperial Motion Picture Theater, right away. Something\nI've got to tell you. I'll be in the lobby. Hurry!\"\n\nWhen he bolted in she was already in the lobby, agitatedly looking over\na frame of \"stills.\" She ran to him, hooked her fingers in his lapel,\npoured out, \"They've invited you to the opera? I want you to come and\nput it all over them. I'm almost sure there's a plot. They want to show\nme that you aren't used to tiaras and saxophones and creaking dowagers\nand tulle. Beat 'em! Beat 'em! Come to the opera and be awf'ly aloof and\nsupercilious. You can! Yes, you can! And be sure--wear evening clothes.\nNow I've got to hurry.\"\n\n\"B-but----\"\n\n\"Don't disappoint me. I depend on you. Oh, say you will!\"\n\n\"I will!\"\n\nShe was gone, whisking into the Gilson limousine. He was in a glow at\nher loyalty, in a tremor of anger at the meddlers.\n\nBut he had never worn evening clothes.\n\nHe called it \"a dress-suit,\" and before the complications of that exotic\ngarb, he was flabby with anxiety. To Milt and to Schoenstrom--to Bill\nMcGolwey, even to Prof Jones and the greasily prosperous Heinie\nRauskukle--the dress-suit was the symbol and proof, the indication and\nmanner, of sophisticated wealth. In Schoenstrom even waiters do not wear\ndress-suits. For one thing there aren't any waiters. There is one\nwaitress at the Leipzig House, Miss Annie Schweigenblat, but you\nwouldn't expect Miss Schweigenblat to deal them off the arm in black\ntrousers with braid down the side.\n\nNo; a dress-suit was what the hero wore in the movies; and the hero in\nthe movies, when he wasn't a cowpuncher, was an ex-captain of the Yale\nfootball team, and had chambers and a valet. You could tell him from the\nvalet because he wasn't so bald. It is true that Milt had heard that in\nSt. Cloud there were people who wore dress-suits at parties, but then\nSt. Cloud was a city, fifteen or sixteen thousand.\n\n\"How could he get away with a dress-suit? How could he keep from feeling\nfoolish in a low-cut vest, and what the deuce would he do with the\ntails? Did you part 'em or roll 'em up, when you sat down? And wouldn't\neverybody be able to tell from his foolish look that he didn't belong in\none?\" He could hear A.D.T. boys and loafers in front of pool rooms\nwhispering, \"Look at the piker in the rented soup and fish!\"\n\nFor of course he'd rent one. Nobody bought them--except plutes like\nHenry B. Boltwood.\n\nHe agitatedly walked up and down for an hour, peering into haberdashery\nwindows, looking for a kind-faced young man. He found him, in Ye Pall\nMall Toggery Shoppe & Shoes; an open-faced young man who was gazing\nthrough the window as sparklingly as though he was thinking of going as\na missionary to India--and liked curry. Milt ironed out his worried\nface, clumped in, demanded fraternally, \"Say, old man, don't some of\nthese gents' furnishings stores have kind of little charts that tell\njust what you wear with dress-suits and Prince Alberts and everything?\"\n\n\"You bet,\" said the kind-faced young man.\n\nWest of Chicago, \"You bet\" means \"Rather,\" and \"Yes indeed,\" and \"On the\nwhole I should be inclined to fancy that there may be some vestiges of\naccuracy in your curious opinion,\" and \"You're a liar but I can't afford\nto say so.\"\n\nThe kind-faced young man brought from behind the counter a beautiful\nbrochure illustrated with photographs of Phoebus Apollo in what were\ndescribed as \"American Beauty Garments--neat, natty, nobby, new.\" The\ncenter pages faithfully catalogued the ties, shirts, cuff-links, spats,\nboots, hats, to wear with evening clothes, morning clothes, riding\nclothes, tennis costumes, polite mourning.\n\nAs he looked it over Milt felt that his wardrobe already contained all\nthese gentlemanly possessions.\n\nWith the aid of the clerk and the chart he purchased a tradition-haunted\ngarment with a plate-armor bosom and an opening as crooked as the\nMissouri River; a white tie which in his strong red hands looked as\nsilly as a dead fish; waistcoat, pearl links, and studs. For the first\ntime, except for seizures of madness during two or three visits to\nMinneapolis motor accessory stores, he caught the shopping-fever. The\nlong shining counter, the trim red-stained shelves, the glittering\ncases, the racks of flaunting ties, were beautiful to him and\nbeckoning. He revolved a pleasantly clicking rack of ties, then turned\nand fought his way out.\n\nHe bought pumps--which cost exactly twice as much as the largest sum\nwhich he had allowed himself. He bought a newspaper, and in the\nwant-columns found the advertisement:\n\n Silberfarb the Society Tailor\n      DRESS SUITS TO RENT\n     Snappiest in the City\n\nDespite the superlative snappiness of Mr. Silberfarb's dress-suits his\nestablishment was a loft over a delicatessen, approached by a splintery\nstairway along which hung shabby signs announcing the upstairs offices\nof \"J. L. & T. J. O'Regan, Private Detectives,\" \"The Zenith Spiritualist\nChurch, Messages by Rev. Lulu Paughouse,\" \"The International Order of\nLive Ones, Seattle Wigwam,\" and \"Mme. Lavourie, Sulphur Baths.\" The dead\nair of the hallway suggested petty crookedness. Milt felt that he ought\nto fight somebody but, there being no one to fight, he banged along the\nflapping boards of the second-floor hallway to the ground-glass door of\nSilberfarb the Society Tailor, who was also, as an afterthought on a\nstraggly placard, \"Pressng & Cleang While U Wait.\"\n\nHe belligerently shouldered into a low room. The light from the one\nwindow was almost obscured by racks of musty-smelling black clothes\nwhich stretched away from him in two dismal aisles that resembled a\nmorgue of unhappy dead men indecently hung up on hooks. On a long,\nclumsily carpentered table, a small Jew, collarless, sweaty, unshaven,\nwas darning trousers under an evil mantle gaslight. The Jew wrung out\nhis hands and tried to look benevolent.\n\n\"Want to rent a dress-suit,\" said Milt.\n\n\"I got just the t'ing for you!\"\n\nThe little man unfolded himself, galloped down the aisle, seized the\nfirst garment that came to hand, and came back to lay it against Milt's\nuncomfortable frame, bumbling, \"Fine, mister, fy-en!\"\n\nMilt studied the shiny-seamed, worn-buttonholed, limp object with\ndislike. Its personality was disintegrated. The only thing he liked\nabout it was the good garage stink of gasoline.\n\n\"That's almost worn out,\" he growled.\n\nAt this sacrilege Mr. Silberfarb threw up his hands, with the dingy suit\nflapping in them like a bed-quilt shaken from a tenement window. He\nlooked Milt all over, coldly. His red but shining eyes hinted that Milt\nwas a clodhopper and no honest wearer of evening clothes. Milt felt\nhumble, but he snapped, \"No good. Want something with class.\"\n\n\"Vell, that was good enough for a university professor at the big dance,\nbut if you say so----\"\n\nIn the manner of one who is being put to an unfair amount of trouble,\nMr. Silberfarb returned the paranoiac dress-suit to the rack, sighing\npatiently as he laboriously draped it on a hanger. He peered and pawed.\nHe crowed with throaty triumph and brought back a rich ripe thing of\nvelvet collar and cuffs. He fixed Milt with eyes that had become as\nsulky as the eyes of a dog in August dust.\n\n\"Now that--you can't beat that, if you vant class, and it'll fit you\nlike a glove. Oh, that's an ellllegant garment!\"\n\nShaking himself out of the spell of those contemptuous eyes Milt opened\nhis brochure, studied the chart, and in a footnote found, \"Never wear\nvelvet collars or cuffs with evening coat.\"\n\n\"Nope. Nix on the velvet,\" he remarked.\n\nThen the little man went mad and ran around in circles. He flung the\nellllegant garment on the table. He flapped his arms, and wailed, \"What\ndo you vant? What do you vannnnt? That's a hundred-and-fifty-dollar\ndress-suit! That belonged to one of the richest men in the city. He sold\nit to me because he was going to Japan.\"\n\n\"Well, you can send it to Japan after him. I want something decent. Have\nyou got it--or shall I go some place else?\"\n\nThe tailor instantly became affectionate. \"How about a nice Tuxedo?\" he\ncoaxed.\n\n\"Nope. It says here--let me see--oh yes, here it is--it says here in the\nbook that for the theater-with-ladies, should not wear 'dinner-coat or\nso-called Tuxedo, but----'\"\n\n\"Oh, dem fellows what writes books they don't know nothing. Absolute!\nThey make it up.\"\n\n\"Huh! Well, I guess I'll take my chance on them. The factory knows the\nignition better 'n any repair-man.\"\n\n\"Vell say, you're a hard fellow to please. I'll give you one of my\nreserve stock, but you got to leave me ten dollars deposit instead of\nfive.\"\n\nMr. Silberfarb quite cheerfully unlocked a glass case behind the racked\nand ghostly dead; he brought out a suit that seemed to Milt almost\ndecent. And it almost fitted when, after changing clothes in a broiling,\nboiling, reeking, gasoline-pulsing hole behind the racks, he examined it\nbefore a pier-glass. But he caught the tailor assisting the fit by\nbunching up a roll of cloth at the shoulder. Again Milt snapped, and\nagain the tailor suffered and died, and to a doubting heathen world\nmaintained the true gospel of \"What do you vannnnt? It ain't stylish to\nhave the dress-suit too tight! All the gents is wearing 'em loose and\ngraceful.\" But in the end, after Milt had gone as far as the door, Mr.\nSilberfarb admitted that one dress-coat wouldn't always fit all persons\nwithout some alterations.\n\nThe coat did bag a little, and it was too long in the sleeves, but as\nMilt studied himself in his room--by placing his small melancholy mirror\non the bureau, then on a chair, then on the floor, finally, to get a\ncomplete view, clear out in the hall--he admitted with stirring delight\nthat he looked \"pretty fair in the bloomin' outfit.\" His clear face, his\nshining hair, his straight shoulders, seemed to go with the costume.\n\nHe wriggled into his top-coat and marched out of his room,\ntheater-bound, with the well-fed satisfaction of a man who is certain\nthat no one is giggling, \"Look at the hand-me-downs.\" His pumps did\nalternately pinch his toes and rub his heels; the trousers cramped his\nwaist; and he suspected that his tie had gone wandering. But he\nswaggered to the trolley, and sat as one rich and famous and very kind\nto the Common People, till----\n\nAnother man in evening clothes got on the car, and Milt saw that he wore\na silk hat, and a white knitted scarf; that he took out and examined a\npair of white kid gloves.\n\nHe'd forgotten the hat! He was wearing his gray felt. He could risk the\ngloves, but the hat--the \"stovepipe\"--and the chart had said to wear\none--he was ruined----\n\nHe turned up the collar of his top-coat to conceal his white tie, tried\nto hide each of his feet behind the other to cover up his pumps; sought\nto change his expression from that of a superior person in evening\nclothes to that of a decent fellow in honest Regular Clothes. Had the\nconductor or any of the passengers realized that he was a dub in a\ndress-suit without the hat?\n\nOnce he thought that the real person in real evening clothes was looking\nat him. He turned his head and bore the probable insult in weak misery.\n\nToo feeble for anything but thick suffering he was dragged on toward the\ntheater, the opera, people in silk hats--toward Jeff Saxton and\nexposure.\n\nBut his success in bullying the tailor had taught him that dressing\nwasn't really a hidden lore to be known only by initiates; that some day\nhe too might understand the black and white magic of clothes. His\nbruised self-consciousness healed. \"I'll do--something,\" he determined.\nHe waited, vacuously.\n\nThe Gilson party was not in the lobby when he arrived. He tore off his\ntop-coat. He draped it over his felt hat, so that no one could be sure\nwhat sort of hat it shamefully concealed. That unveiling did expose him\nto the stare of everybody waiting in the lobby. He was convinced that\nthe entire ticket-buying cue was glumly resenting him. Peeping down at\nthe unusual white glare of his shirt-front, he felt naked and\nindecent.... \"Nice kind o' vest. Must make 'em out of old piqu\u00c3\u00a9\ncollars.\"\n\nHe endured his martyrdom till his party arrived--the Gilsons, Claire,\nJeff Saxton, and a glittering young woman whose name, Milt thought, was\nMrs. Corey.\n\nAnd Saxton wasn't wearing a high hat! He wore a soft one, and he didn't\nseem to care!\n\nMilt straightened up, followed them through the manifold dangers of the\nlobby, down a perilous aisle of uptilted scornful faces, to a red narrow\ncorridor, winding stairs, a secret passage, a mysterious dark\ncloset--and he walked out into a room with one side missing, and, on\nthat side, ten trillion people in a well, and nine trillion of them\nstaring at him and noticing that he'd rented his dress-suit. Hot about\nthe neck, he stumbled over one or two chairs, and was permitted to rest\nin a foolish little gilt chair in the farthest corner.\n\nOnce safe, he felt much better. Except that Jeff did put on white kid\ngloves, Milt couldn't see that they two looked so different. And neither\nof the two men in the next box wore gloves. Milt made sure of that\ncomfort; he reveled in it; he looked at Claire, and in her loyal smile\nfound ease.\n\nHe snarled, \"She trusts you. Forget you're a dub. Try to be human. Hang\nit, I'm no greener at the opera than old horsehair sofa there would be\nat a garage.\"\n\nThere was something---- What was it he was trying to remember? Oh yes.\nWhen he'd worked in the Schoenstrom flour-mill, as engineer, at\neighteen, the owner had tried to torment him (to \"get his goat,\" Milt\nput it), and Milt had found that the one thing that would save him was\nto smile as though he knew more than he was telling. It did not, he\nremembered, make any difference whether or not the smile was real. If he\nmerely looked the miller up and down, and smiled cynically, he was let\nalone.\n\nWhy not----\n\nSaxton was bending toward him, asking in honeyed respectfulness:\n\n\"Don't you think that the new school in music--audible pointillage, one\nmight call it--mistakes cacophony for power?\"\n\nMilt smiled, paternally.\n\nSaxton waited for something more. He dug the nail of his right middle\nfinger into his thumb, looked thoughtful, and attacked again:\n\n\"Which do you like better: the new Italian music, or the orthodox\nGerman?\"\n\nMilt smiled like two uncles watching a clever baby, and patronized\nSaxton with, \"They both have their points.\"\n\nHe saw that Claire was angry; but that the Gilsons and Mrs. Corey,\nflap-eared, gape-mouthed, forward-bending, were very proud of their\nlittle Jeff. He saw that, except for their clothes and self-conscious\ncoiffures, they were exactly like a gang of cracker-box loafers at\nHeinie Rauskukle's badgering a new boy in town.\n\nSaxton looked bad-tempered. Then Mrs. Corey bustled with her face and\nyearned at Milt, \"Do tell me: what is the theme of the opera tonight.\nI've rather forgotten.\"\n\nMilt ceased to smile. While all of them regarded him with interest he\nsaid clearly, \"I haven't got the slightest idea. I don't know anything\nabout music. Some day I hope I can get a clever woman like you to help\nme, Mrs. Corey. It must be great to know all about all these arts, the\nway you do. I wish you'd explain that--overture they call it, don't\nthey?\"\n\nFor some reason, Mr. Gilson was snickering, Mrs. Corey flushing, Claire\nlooking well pleased. Milt had tried to be insulting, but had got lost\nin the intricacies of the insult. He felt that he'd better leave it in\nits apparently safe state, and he leaned back, and smiled again, as\nthough he was waiting. Mrs. Corey did not explain the overture. She\nhastily explained her second maid, to Mrs. Gilson.\n\nThe opera was _Il Amore dei Tre Re_. Milt was bewildered. To him, who\nhad never seen an opera, the convention that a girl cannot hear a man\nwho is bellowing ten feet away from her, was absurd; and he wished that\nthe singers would do something besides making their arms swim.\n\nHe discovered that by moving his chair forward, he could get within a\nfoot of Claire. His hand slipped across, touched hers. She darted a\nstartled backward glance. Her fingers closed tight about his, then\nrestlessly snuggled inside his palm--and Milt was lost in enchantment.\n\nStately kings of blood-red cloaks and chrysoberyls malevolent in crowns\nof ancient and massy gold--the quick dismaying roll of drums and the\nshadow of passing banners below a tower--a woman tall and misty-veiled\nand pale with dreams--a world of spirit where the soul had power over\nunseen dominions--this he saw and heard and tasted in the music. What\nthe actual plot was, or the technique of the singing, he did not know,\nbut it bore him beyond all reality save the sweet, sure happiness of\nClaire's nestling hand.\n\nHe held her fingers so firmly that he could feel the pulse beat in them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the clamminess of his room, when the enchantment was gone, he said\ngravely:\n\n\"How much longer can I keep this up? Sooner or later I bust loose and\nsmash little Jeff one in the snoot, and he takes the count, and I'm\nnever allowed to see Claire again. Turn the roughneck out on his ear. I\ns'pose I'm vulgar. I s'pose that fellow Michael in _Youth's Encounter_\nwouldn't talk about snoots. I don't care, I'll---- If I poke Saxton\none---- I'm not afraid of the kid-glove precinct any more. My brain's\nas good as theirs, give it a chance. But oh, they're all against me. And\nthey bust the Athletic Union's wrestling rule that 'striking, kicking,\ngouging, hair-pulling, butting, and strangling will not be allowed.' How\nlong can I go on being good-natured? When I do break loose----\"\n\nSlowly, beneath the moral cuff of his dress-shirt, Milt's fist closed in\na brown, broad-knuckled lump, and came up in the gesture of a right to\nthe jaw. But it came up only a foot. The hand opened, climbed to Milt's\nface, rubbed his temples, while he sighed:\n\n\"Nope. Can't even do that. Bigger game now. Used to could--used to be\nable to settle things with a punch. But I've got to be more--oh, more\ndiplomatic now. Oh Lord, how lonely I get for Bill McGolwey. No. That\nisn't true. I couldn't stand Bill now. Claire took all that out of me.\nWhere am I, where am I? Why did I ever get a car that takes a 36 \u00c3\u0097 6?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nTHE CORNFIELD ARISTOCRAT\n\n\nIt was an innocent little note from Jeff Saxton; a polite, humble little\nnote; it said that Jeff had a card to the Astoria Club, and wouldn't\nMilt please have lunch with him? But Milt dropped it on the table, and\nhe walked round it as though it were a dictagraph which he'd discovered\nin the table drawer after happy, happy, hidden hours at counterfeiting.\n\nIt seemed more dangerous to refuse than to go. He browned the celebrated\nnew shoes; he pressed the distinguished new trousers, with a light and\nquite unsatisfactory flatiron; he re-re-retied his best spotted blue\nbow--it persisted in having the top flaps too short, but the retying\ngave him spiritual strength--and he modestly clumped into the aloof\nbrick portal of the Astoria Club on time.\n\nHe had never been in a club before.\n\nHe looked at the red tiled floor of the entrance hall; he stared through\nthe hall into an immense lounge with the largest and softest chairs in\nthe world, with oil portraits of distinguished old bucks, and ninety per\ncent. of the wealth and power of Seattle pulling its several mustaches,\nreading the P.I., and ignoring the lone intruder out in the hall.\n\nA small Zulu in blue tights and brass buttons glared at Milt; and a\nlarge, soft, suave, insulting young man demanded, \"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"Mr. G-g-geoffrey Saxton?\" ventured Milt.\n\n\"Not in, sir.\" The \"sir\" sounded like \"And you know it.\" The flaming\nguardian retired behind a narrow section of a bookkeeper's desk and\nignored him.\n\n\"I'm to meet him for lunch,\" Milt forlornly persisted.\n\nThe young man looked up, hurt and annoyed at finding that the person was\nstill to be dealt with.\n\n\"If you will wait in there?\" he groaned.\n\nMilt sat in there, which was a small blue tapestry room with hard chairs\nintended to discourage bill-collectors. He turned his hat round and\nround and round, till he saw Jeff Saxton, slim and straight and hard as\nthe stick hooked over his arm, sailing into the hall. He plunged out\nafter him, took refuge with him from the still unconvinced inspection of\nthe hall-man. For twenty seconds, he loved Jeff Saxton.\n\nAnd Jeff seemed to adore him in turn. He solicitously led Milt to the\nhat-checking counter. He showed Milt the lounge and the billiard room,\nthrough which Milt crept with erect shoulders and easy eyes and a heart\nsimply paralyzed with fear that one of these grizzled clubmen with\nclipped mustaches would look at him. He coaxed Milt into a grill that\nwas a cross between the Chinese throne-room and a Viennese Weinstube,\nand he implored his friend Milt to do him the favor of trying the \"very\nfair\" English mutton chops and potatoes _au gratin_.\n\n\"I did want to see you again before we go East, Daggett,\" he said\npleasantly.\n\n\"Th-thanks. When do you go?\"\n\n\"I'm trying to get Miss Boltwood to start soon now. The season is\nopening in the East. She does like your fine sturdy West, as I do, but\nstill, when we think of the exciting new shows opening, and the dances,\nand the touch with the great world---- Oh, it does make one eager to get\nback.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" risked Milt.\n\n\"We, uh---- Daggett---- In fact, I'm going to call you Milt, as Claire\ndoes. You don't know what a pleasure it has been to have encountered\nyou. There's a fine keen courage about you Western chaps that makes a\ncautious old fogy like me envious. I shall remember meeting you with a\ngreat deal of pleasure.\"\n\n\"Th-thanks. Been pleasure meet you.\"\n\n\"And I know Claire will, too.\"\n\nMilt felt that he was being dealt with foully. He wanted to object to\nSaxton's acting as agent for Claire as incompetent, irrelevant,\nimmaterial, and no foundation laid. But he could not see just where he\nwas being led, and with Saxton glowing at him as warmly and greasily as\nthe mutton chops, Milt could only smile wanly, and reflectively feel\nthe table leg to see if it was loose enough to jerk out in case of need.\n\nSaxton was being optimistic:\n\n\"In fact, Claire and I both hope that some day when you've finished your\nengineering course, we'll see you in the East. I wonder---- As I say, my\ndear fellow, I've taken the greatest fancy to you, and I do hope you\nwon't think I'm too intimate if I say that I imagine that even in your\ncharming friendship with Miss Boltwood, you've probably never learned\nwhat important people the Boltwoods are. I thought I'd tell you so that\nyou could realize the privilege both you and I have in knowing them.\nHenry B. is--while not a man of any enormous wealth--regarded as one of\nthe keenest intellects in New York wholesale circles. But beyond that,\nhe is a scholar, and a man of the broadest interests. Of course the\nBoltwoods are too modest to speak of it, but he was chiefly instrumental\nin the establishment of the famous Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra. And his\nancestors clear through--his father was a federal judge, and his\nmother's brother was a general in the Civil War, and afterwards an\nambassador. So you can guess something of the position Claire holds in\nthat fine, quiet, solid old Brooklyn set. Henry Ward Beecher himself was\ncomplimented at being asked to dine with the Boltwoods of his day,\nand----\"\n\nNo, the table leg wouldn't come loose, so it was only verbally that the\nsuddenly recovered Milt attacked:\n\n\"Certainly is nice to have one of those old families. It's something\nlike---- As you say, you and I have gotten pretty well acquainted along\nthe line, so I guess I can say it to you---- My father and his folks\ncame from that same kind of family. Father's dad was a judge, back in\nMaine, and in the war, grand-dad was quite friendly with Grant.\"\n\nThis tribute of Milt to his grandsire was loyal but inaccurate. Judge\nDaggett, who wasn't a judge at all, but a J. P., had seen General Grant\nonly once, and at the time the judge had been in company with all the\nother privates in the Fourteenth Maine.\n\n\"Dad was a pioneer. He was a doctor. He had to give up all this\neasy-going stuff in order to help open up the West to civilization, but\nI guess it was worth it. He used to do the hardest kind of operations,\non kitchen tables, with his driver giving the chloroform. I'm mighty\nproud of him. As you say, it's kind of what you might call inspiring to\nbelong to the old Pilgrim aristocracy.\"\n\nNever before had Milt claimed relation to a group regarding which his\nonly knowledge was the information derived from the red school-history\nto the effect that they all carried blunderbusses, put people in the\nstocks for whistling, and frequently said, \"Why don't you speak for\nyourself, John?\" But he had made his boast with a clear eye and a\npleasant, superior, calm smile.\n\n\"Oh! Very interesting,\" grunted Saxton.\n\n\"Would you like to see grandfather's daguerreotype?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, uh, thanks, that would be very interesting---- Do let me\nsee it, when---- Uh, as I was saying, Claire doubtless has a tremendous\nsocial career before her. So many people expecting her to marry well. Of\ncourse she has a rather unusual combination of charm and intelligence\nand---- In fact I think we may both be glad that----\"\n\n\"Yes. That's right. And the best thing about her is the way she can\nshake off all the social stuff and go camping and be a regular human\nbeing,\" Milt caressed.\n\n\"Um, uh, no doubt, no doubt, though---- Of course, though, that isn't an\ninherent part of her. I fancy she's been rather tired by this long trip,\npoor child. Of course she isn't very strong.\"\n\n\"That's right. Real pluck. And of course she'll get stronger by hiking.\nYou've never seen her bucking a dangerous hill--I kind of feel that a\nperson who hasn't seen her in the wilds doesn't know her.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be contradictory, old man, but I feel on the other hand\nthat no one who has failed to see her at the Junior League Dances, in a\nPoiret frock, can know her! Come, come! Don't know how we drifted into\nthis chorus of praise of Claire! What I wanted to ask was your opinion\nof the Pierce-Arrow. I'm thinking of buying one. Do you think that----\"\n\nAll the way home Milt exulted, \"I put it all over him. I wasn't scared\nby the 'Don't butt into the aristocracy, my young friend' stuff. I lied\nhandsome. But---- Darn it, now I'll have to live up to my New England\naristocracy.... Wonder if my grand-dad's dad was a hired man or a\nwood-sawyer?... Ne' mine; I'm Daggett of Daggett from now on.\" He\nbounded up to his room vaingloriously remarking, \"I'm there with the\nancestors. I was brought up in the handsome city of Schoenstrom, which\nwas founded by a colony of Vermont Yankees, headed by Herman Skumautz. I\nwas never allowed to play with the Dutch kids, and----\" He opened the\ndoor. \"--the Schoenstrom minister taught me Greek and was my bosom\nfrien'----\"\n\nHe stopped with his heart in his ankles. Lolling on the bed, grinning,\nwaving a cigarette, was Bill McGolwey, proprietor of the Old Home Lunch,\nof Schoenstrom, Minnesota.\n\n\"Wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwhy where the heck did you come from?\"\nstammered the deposed aristocrat to his bosom friend Bill.\n\n\"You old lemon-pie-faced, lollygagging, flap-footed, crab-nosed son of\nmisery, gee, but it's good to see you, Milt!\"\n\nBill was off the bed, wringing Milt's hand with simple joy, with perfect\nfaith that in finding his friend all the troubles of life were over. And\nMilt was gloomily discovering the art of diplomacy. Bill was his friend,\nyes, but----\n\nIt was hard enough to carry his own self.\n\nHe pictured Jeff Saxton leering at the door, and while he pounded Bill's\nshoulder, and called him the name which, west of Chicago, is the token\nof hatred and of extreme gladness at meeting, he discovered that some\none had stolen his stomach and left a piece of ice in its place.\n\nThey settled down on bed and chair, Bill's ears red with joy, while Milt\ndemanded:\n\n\"How the deuce did you get here?\"\n\n\"Well, tell you, old hoss. Schoenstrom got so darn lonely after you\nleft, and when Ben and Heinie got your address and bought the garage,\nthink's I, lez go off on a little bum.\"\n\nMilt was realizing--and hating himself for realizing--that Bill's face\nwas dirty, his hair linty, the bottoms of his trousers frayed masses of\nmud, while Bill chuckled:\n\n\"I figured out maybe I could get a job here in a restaurant, and you and\nme could room together. I sold out my good will in the Old Home Lunch\nfor a hundred bucks. I was going to travel swell, riding the cushions.\nBut Pete Swanson wanted me to go down to the Cities first, and we run\ninto some pretty swift travelers in Minneapolis, and a couple of\ngirls--saaaaaaay, kid, some class!\"\n\nBill winked, and Milt--Milt was rather sick. He knew Bill's conception\nof class in young women. Was this the fellow he had liked so well? These\nthe ideas which a few months ago he had taken as natural and extremely\namusing?\n\n\"And I got held up in an alley off Washington Avenue, and they got the\nlast twenty bones off'n me, and I was flatter 'n a pancake. So I says\n'ish kabibble,' and I sneaks onto the blind baggage, and bums my way\nWest. You'd 'a' died laughing to seen me throwing my feet for grub. Oh,\nI'm some panhandler! There was one _Frau_ sicked her dog onto me, and I\nkicked him in the jaw and---- Oh, it was one swell hike.\"\n\nMilt was trying to ignore the voice that was raging, \"And now he expects\nto live on me, after throwing his own money away. The waster! The hobo!\nHe'll expect to meet Claire---- I'd kill him before I'd let him soil her\nby looking at her. Him and his classy girls!\" Milt tried to hear only\nthe other inner voice, which informed him, \"He looks at you so\ntrustingly. He'd give you his shirt, if you needed it--and he wouldn't\nmake you ask for it!\"\n\nMilt tried to be hearty: \"What're you going to do, old kid?\"\n\n\"Well, the first thing I'm going to do is to borrow ten iron-men and a\npair of pants.\"\n\n\"You bet! Here she is. Haven't got any extra pants. Tell you: Here's\nanother five, and you can get the pants at the store in the next block,\nthis side of the street. Hustle along now and get 'em!\" He chuckled at\nBill; he patted his arm; he sought to hurry him out.... He had to be\nalone, to think.\n\nBut Bill kissed the fifteen dollars, carelessly rammed it into his\npocket, crawled back on the bed, yawned, \"What's the rush? Gosh, I'm\nsleepy. Say, Milt, whadyuh think of me and you starting a lunch-room\nhere together? You got enough money out of the garage----\"\n\n\"Oh no, noooo, gee, I'd like to, Bill, but you see, well, I've got to\nhold onto what little I've got so I can get through engineering school.\"\n\n\"Sure, but you could cash in on a restaurant--you could work evenings in\nthe dump, and there'd be a lot of city sports hanging around, and we'd\nhave the time of our lives.\"\n\n\"No, I---- I study, evenings. And I---- The fact is, Bill, I've met a\nlot of nice fellows at the university and I kind of go around with\nthem.\"\n\n\"Aw, how d'you get that way? Rats, you don't want to go tagging after\nthem Willy-boys. Damn dirty snobs. And the girls are worse. I tell you,\nMilt, these hoop-te-doodle society Janes may look all right to hicks\nlike us, but on the side they raise more hell than any milliner's\ntrimmer from Chi that ever vamped a rube burg.\"\n\n\"What do you know about them?\"\n\n\"Now don't get sore. I'm telling you. I don't like to see any friend of\nmine make a fool of himself hanging around with a bunch that despises\nhim because he ain't rich, that's all. Met any of the high-toned\nskirts?\"\n\n\"Yes--I--_have_!\"\n\n\"Trot 'em up and lemme give 'em the once-over.\"\n\n\"We--we'll see about it. Now I got to go to a mathematics recitation,\nBill. You make yourself comfortable, and I'll be back at five.\"\n\nMilt did not have to go to a recitation. He marched out with briskness\nin his step, and a book under his arm; but when he reached the corner,\nthe briskness proved to be spurious, and the mathematics book proved to\nbe William Rose Ben\u00c3\u00a9t's _Merchants of Cathay_, which Claire had given\nhim in the Yellowstone, and which he had rescued from the wrecked bug.\n\nHe stood staring at it. He opened it with unhappy tenderness. He had\nbeen snatched from the world of beautiful words and serene dignity, of\nsoaring mountains and companionship with Claire in the radiant morning,\nback to the mud and dust of Schoenstrom, from the opera to \"city sports\"\nin a lunch-room! He hated Bill McGolwey and his sneering assumption that\nMilt belonged in the filth with him. And he hated himself for not being\nenough of a genius to combine Bill McGolwey and Claire Boltwood. But not\nonce, in his maelstrom of worry on that street corner, did he expect\nClaire to like Bill. Through all his youthful agonizing, he had enough\ncommon sense to know that though Claire might conquer a mountain pass,\nshe could never be equal to the social demands of Schoenstrom and Bill\nMcGolwey.\n\nHe wandered for an hour and came back to find that, in a \"dry\" city\nwhich he had never seen before, the crafty Bill had obtained a quart of\nBourbon, and was in a state of unsteady beatitude. He wanted, he\nannounced, to dance.\n\nMilt got him into the community bathtub, and soused him under, but\nBill's wet body was slippery, and Bill's merry soul was all for\nfrolicsome gamboling, and he slid out of Milt's grasp, he sloshed around\nin the tub, he sprinkled Milt's sacred good suit with soapy water, and\nescaped, and in the costume of Adam he danced orientally in Milt's room,\ntill he was seized with sleepiness and cosmic grief, and retired to\nMilt's bed in tears and nothing else.\n\nThe room dimmed, grew dark. The street lamps outside sent a wan, wavery\ngleam into the room. Evening crowds went by, and in a motion-picture\ntheater a banging piano struck up. Bill breathed in choking snorts. Milt\nsat unmoving, feeling very old, very tired, too dumbly unhappy to be\nfrightened of the dreadful coming hour when Claire and Jeff should hear\nof Bill, and discover Milt's real world.\n\nHe was not so romantically loyal, not so inhumanly heroic, that it can\ntruthfully be reported that he never thought of getting rid of Bill. He\ndid think of it, again and again. But always he was touched by Bill's\nunsuspecting trust, and shook his head, and sank again into the fog.\n\nWhat was the use of trying to go ahead? Wasn't he, after all, merely a\nBill McGolwey himself?\n\nIf he was, he wouldn't inflict himself on Claire.\n\nFor several minutes he gave up forever the zest of climbing.\n\nWhen Bill awoke, brightly solicitous about the rest of the quart of\nBourbon, and bouncingly ready to \"go out and have a time,\" Milt loafed\nabout the streets with him, showing him the city. He dully cut his\nclasses, next morning, and took Bill to the wharves.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon, when they were lounging in the room, and\nBill was admiring his new pants--he boasted of having bought them for\nthree dollars, and pointed out that Milt had been a \"galoot\" to spend\nten dollars for shoes--that some one knocked at the door. Sleepily\nexpectant of his landlady, Milt opened it on Miss Claire Boltwood, Mr.\nand Mrs. Eugene Gilson, and Mr. Geoffrey Saxton.\n\nSaxton calmly looked past him, at Bill, smiled slightly, and\ncondescended, \"I thought we ought to call on you, so we've dropped in to\nbeg for tea.\"\n\nBill had stopped midway in scratching his head to gape at Claire. Claire\nreturned the look, stared at Bill's frowsy hair, his red wrists, his\nwrinkled, grease-stained coat, his expression of impertinent stupidity.\nThen she glanced questioningly at Milt, who choked:\n\n\"Oh yes, yes, sure, glad see you, come in, get some tea, so glad see\nyou, come in----\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nTOOTH-MUG TEA\n\n\n\"My friend Mr. McGolwey--I knew him in Schoenstrom--come on to Seattle\nfor a while. Bill, these are some people I met along the road,\" Milt\ngrumbled.\n\n\"Glad to meet 'em. Have a chair. Have two chairs! Say, Milt, y'ought to\nhave more chairs if you're going to have a bunch of swells coming to\ncall on you. Ha, ha, ha! Say, I guess I better pike out and give the\nfolks a chance to chin with you,\" Bill fondly offered.\n\n\"Oh, sit down,\" Milt snapped at him.\n\nThey all sat down, four on the bed; and Milt's inner ear heard a mute\nsnicker from the Gilsons and Saxton. He tried to talk. He couldn't. Bill\nlooked at him and, perceiving the dumbness, gallantly helped out:\n\n\"So you met the kid on the road, eh? Good scout, Milt is. We always used\nto say at Schoenstrom that he was the best darn hand at fixing a flivver\nin seven townships.\"\n\n\"So you knew Mr. Daggett at home? Now isn't that nice,\" said Mrs.\nGilson.\n\n\"_Knew_ him? Saaaaay, Milt and I was brung up together. Why, him and I\nhave bummed around together, and worked on farms, summers, and fished\nfor bull-heads---- Ever catch a bull-head? Damnedest slipperiest fish\nyou ever saw, and got horns that sting the stuffin's out of you and----\nSay, I wonder if Milt's told you about the time we had at a barn-dance\nonce? There was a bunch of hicks there, and I says, 'Say, kid, lez\npuncture their tires, and hide back of the manure pile, and watch the\nfun when they come out.' I guess maybe I was kind of stewed a little,\ntell the truth, but course Milt he don't drink much, hardly at all, nice\nstraight kid if I do say so----\"\n\n\"Bill!\" Milt ordered. \"We must have some tea. Here's six-bits. You run\ndown to the corner grocery and get some tea and a little cream. Oh, you\nbetter buy three-four cups, too. Hustle now, son!\"\n\n\"Attaboy! Yours to command, ladies and gents, like the fellow says!\"\nBill boomed delightedly. He winked at Jeff Saxton, airily spun his\nbroken hat on his dirty forefinger, and sauntered out.\n\n\"Charming fellow. A real original,\" crooned Mrs. Gilson.\n\n\"Did he know your friend Mr. Pinky?\" asked Saxton.\n\nBefore Milt could answer, Claire rose from the bed, inspected the\nGilsons and Jeff with cold dislike, and said quietly to Milt, \"The poor\ndear thing--he was dreadfully embarrassed. It's so good of you to be\nnice to him. I believe in being loyal to your old friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, so do I!\" babbled Mrs. Gilson. \"It's just too splendid. And _we_\nmust do something for him. I'm going to invite Mr. Daggett and Mr.--Mr.\nMcGollups, was it?--to dinner this evening. I do want to hear him tell\nabout your boyhood. It must have been so interesting.\"\n\n\"It was,\" mused Milt. \"It was poor and miserable. We had to work\nhard--we had to fight for whatever education we got--we had no one to\nteach us courtesy.\"\n\n\"Oh now, with your fine old doctor father? Surely he was an\ninspiration?\" Jeff didn't, this time, trouble to hide the sneer.\n\n\"Yes. He was. He gave up the chance to be a rich loafer in order to save\nfarmers' babies for fees that he never got.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he did. I wish I'd known him. We need to know men like that in\nthis pink-frosting playing at living we have in cities,\" Claire said\nsweetly--not to Milt but to Jeff.\n\nMrs. Gilson had ignored them, waiting with the patience of a cat at a\nmouse-hole, and she went on, \"But you haven't said you'd come, this\nevening. Do say you will. I don't suppose Mr. McGollups will care to\ndress for dinner?\"\n\nWith saccharin devotion Milt yearned back, \"No, Mrs. Gilson. No. Mr.\nMcGolwey won't care to dress. He's eccentric.\"\n\n\"But you'll make him come?\"\n\nMilt was tactfully beginning to refuse when Gene Gilson at last\nexploded, turned purple, covered his dripping, too-red lips with his\nhandkerchief.\n\nThen, abruptly, Milt hurled at Mrs. Gilson, \"All right. We'll come.\nBill'll be awfully funny. He's never been out of a jerkwater burg in his\nlife, hardly. He's an amusing cuss. He thinks I'm smart! He loves me\nlike a dog. Oh, he's rich! Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\nMilt might have gone on ... if he had, Mr. and Mrs. Gilson would have\ngone away, much displeased. But Bill arrived, with some of the worst tea\nin the world, and four cups tastefully done in cupids' heads and much\ngilt.\n\nMilt made tea, ignoring them, while Bill entertained the Gilsons and\nSaxtons with Rabelaisian stories of threshing-time when shirts prickly\nwith chaff and gritty with dust stuck to sweat-dripping backs; of the\n\"funny thing\" of Milt and Bill being hired to move a garbage-pile and\n\"swiping\" their employer's \"mushmelons\"; of knotting shirts at the\nswimming-hole so that the bawling youngsters had to \"chaw beef\"; of\ndrinking beer in the livery-stable at Melrose; of dropping the\nwater-pitcher from a St. Klopstock hotel window upon the head of the\n\"constabule\" and escaping from him across the lean-to roof.\n\nMrs. Gilson encouraged him; Bill sat with almost closed eyes, glorying\nin the saga of small-town life; Saxton and Gilson did not conceal their\ncontemptuous grins.\n\nBut Claire---- After nervously rubbing the tips of her thumbs with\nflickering agitated fingers, she had paid no attention to Bill and the\nrevelation of Milt's rustic life; she had quietly gone to Milt, to help\nhim prepare the scanty tea.\n\nShe whispered, \"Never mind, dear. I don't care. It was all twice as much\nfun as being wheeled in lacy prams by cranky nurses, as Jeff and I were.\nBut I know how you feel. Are you ashamed of having been a prairie\npirate?\"\n\n\"No, I'm not! We were wild kids--we raised a lot of Cain--but I'm glad\nwe did.\"\n\n\"So am I. I couldn't stand it if you were ashamed. Listen to me, and\nremember little Claire's words of wisdom. These fools are trying--oh,\nthey're so obvious!--they're trying to make me feel that the prim Miss\nBoltwood of Brooklyn Heights is a stranger to you. Well, they're\nsucceeding in making me a stranger--to them!\"\n\n\"Claire! Dear! You don't mind Bill?\"\n\n\"Yes. I do. And so do you. You've grown away from him.\"\n\n\"I don't know but---- Today has been quite a test.\"\n\n\"Yes. It has. Because if I can stand your friend Mr. McGolwey----\"\n\n\"Then you do care!\"\n\n\"Perhaps. And if I think that he's, oh, not much good, and I remember\nthat for a long time you just had him to play with, then I'm all the\nmore anxious to make it up to you.\"\n\n\"Don't be sorry for me! I can't stand that! After all, it was a good\ntown, and good folks----\"\n\n\"No! No! I'm not sorry for you! I just mean, you couldn't have had so\nterribly much fun, after you were eighteen or so. Schoenstrom must have\nbeen a little dull, after very many years there. This stuff about the\ncharm of backwoods villages--the people that write it seem to take jolly\ngood care to stay in Long Island suburbs!\"\n\n\"Claire!\" He was whispering desperately, \"The tea's most done. Oh, my\ndear. I'm crazy with this puttering around, trying to woo you and having\nto woo the entire Gilson tribe. Let's run away!\"\n\n\"No; first I'm going to convince them that you are--what I know you\nare.\"\n\n\"But you can't.\"\n\n\"Huh! You wait! I've thought of the most beautiful, beastly cruel plan\nfor the reduction of social obesity----\"\n\nThen she was jauntily announcing, \"Tea, my dears. Jeff, you get the\ntooth-mug. Isn't this jolly!\"\n\n\"Yes. Oh yes. Very jolly!\" Jeff was thoroughly patronizing, but she\ndidn't look offended. She made them drink the acid tea, and taste the\nchalk-like bread and butter sandwiches. She coaxed Bill to go on with\nhis stories, and when the persistent Mrs. Gilson again asked the pariahs\nto come to dinner, Claire astonished Milt, and still more astonished\nMrs. Gilson, by begging, \"Oh yes, please do come, Milt.\"\n\nHe consented, savagely.\n\n\"But first,\" Claire added to Mrs. Gilson, \"I want us to take the boys\nto---- Oh, I have the bulliest idea. Come, everybody. We're going\nriding.\"\n\n\"Uh, where----?\" hinted Mr. Gilson.\n\n\"That's my secret. Come!\"\n\nClaire pranced to the door, herded all of them down to the limousine,\nwhispered an address to the chauffeur.\n\nMilt didn't care much for that ride. Bill was somewhat too evidently not\naccustomed to limousines. He wiped his shoes, caked with red mud, upon\nthe seat-cushions, and apologized perspiringly. He said, \"Gee\nwhillikens, that's a dandy idee, telephone to bawl the shuffer out\nwith,\" and \"Are them flowers real, the bokay in the vase?\"\n\nBut the Gilsons and Jeff Saxton were happy about it all--till the car\nturned from a main thoroughfare upon a muddy street of shacks that clung\nlike goats to the sides of a high cut, a street unchanged from the\npioneer days of Seattle.\n\n\"Good heavens, Claire, you aren't taking us to see Aunt Hatty, are you?\"\nwailed Mrs. Gilson.\n\n\"Oh yes, indeed. I knew the boys would like to meet her.\"\n\n\"No, really, I don't think----\"\n\n\"Eva, my soul, Jeff and you planned our tea party today, and assured me\nI'd be so interested in Milt's bachelor apartment---- By the way, I'd\nbeen up there already, so it wasn't entirely a surprise. It's my turn to\nlead.\" She confided to Milt, \"Dear old Aunt Hatty is related to all of\nus. She's Gene's aunt, and my fourth cousin, and I think she's distantly\nrelated to Jeff. She came West early, and had a hard time, but she's\nreal Brooklyn Heights--and she belongs to Gramercy Park and North\nWashington Square and Rittenhouse Square and Back Bay, too, though she\nhas got out of touch a little. So I wanted you to meet her.\"\n\nMilt wondered what unperceived bag of cement had hardened the faces of\nSaxton and the Gilsons.\n\nSilent save for polite observations of Claire upon tight skirts and\nlumbering, the merry company reached the foot of a lurching flight of\nsteps that scrambled up a clay bank to a cottage like a hen that has set\ntoo long. Milt noticed that Mrs. Gilson made efforts to remain in the\nlimousine when it stopped, and he caught Gilson's mutter to his wife,\n\"No, it's Claire's turn. Be a sport, Eva.\"\n\nClaire led them up the badly listed steps to an unpainted porch on which\nsat a little old lady, very neat, very respectable, very interested, and\nreflectively holding in one ivory hand a dainty handkerchief and a black\nclay pipe.\n\n\"Hello, Claire, my dear. You've broken the relatives' record--you've\ncalled twice in less than a year,\" said the little old lady.\n\n\"How do you do, Aunt Harriet,\" remarked Mrs. Gilson, with great lack of\nwarmth.\n\n\"Hello, Eva. Sit down on the edge of the porch. Those chickens have made\nit awful dirty, though, haven't they? Bring out some chairs. There's two\nchairs that don't go down under you--often.\" Aunt Harriet was very\ncheerful.\n\nThe group lugubriously settled in a circle upon an assemblage of\nwind-broken red velvet chairs and wooden stools. They resembled the\naftermath of a funeral on a damp day.\n\nClaire was the cheerful undertaker, Mrs. Gilson the grief-stricken\nwidow.\n\nClaire waved at Milt and conversed with Aunt Hatty in a high brisk\nvoice: \"This is the nice boy I met on the road that I think I told you\nabout, Cousin Hatty.\"\n\nThe little old lady screwed up the delicate skin about her eyes,\nexamined Milt, and cackled, \"Boy, there's something wrong here. You\ndon't belong with my family. Why, you look like an American. You\nhaven't got an imitation monocle, and I bet you can't talk with a New\nYork-London accent. Why, Claire, I'm ashamed of you for bringing a human\nbeing into the Boltwood-Gilson-Saxton tomb and expecting----\"\n\nThen was the smile of Mrs. Gilson lost forever. It was simultaneously\ntorpedoed, mined, scuttled, and bombed. It went to the bottom without a\nripple, while Mrs. Gilson snapped, \"Aunt Hatty, please don't be vulgar.\"\n\n\"Me?\" croaked the little old lady. She puffed at her pipe, and dropped\nher elbows on her knees. \"My, ain't it hard to please some folks.\"\n\n\"Cousin Hatty, I want Milt to know about our families. I love the dear\nold stories,\" Claire begged prettily.\n\nMrs. Gilson snarled. \"Claire, really----\"\n\n\"Oh, do shut up, Eva, and don't be so bossy!\" yelped the dear little old\nlady, in sudden and dismaying rage. \"I'll talk if I want to. Have they\nbeen bullying you, Claire? Or your boy? I tell you, boy, these families\nare fierce. I was brought up in Brooklyn--went through all the\nschools--used to be able to misplay the piano and mispronounce French\nwith the best of 'em. Then Gene's pa and I came West together--he had an\nidea he'd get rich robbing the Injuns of their land. And we went broke.\nI took in washing. I learned a lot. I learned a Gilson was just the\nsame common stuff as a red-shirt miner, when he was up against it. But\nGene's pa succeeded--there was something about practically stealing a\nfur schooner--but I never was one to tattle on my kin. Anyway, by the\ntime Gene come along, his pa was rich, and that means aristocratic.\n\n\"This aristocracy west of Pittsburgh is just twice as bad as the\nsnobbery in Boston or New York, because back there, the families have\nhad their wealth long enough--some of 'em got it by stealing real estate\nin 1820, and some by selling Jamaica rum and niggers way back before the\nRevolutionary War--they've been respectable so long that they know\nmighty well and good that nobody except a Britisher is going to question\ntheir blue blood--and oh my, what good blueing third-generation money\ndoes make. But out here in God's Country, the marquises of milling and\nthe barons of beef are still uneasy. Even their pretty women, after\ngoing to the best hair-dressers and patronizing the best charities,\nsometimes get scared lest somebody think they haven't either brains or\nbreeding.\n\n\"So they're nasty to all low pussons like you and me, to make sure we\nunderstand how important they are. But lands, I know 'em, boy. I'm kept\npensioned up here, out of the way, but I read the social notes in the\npapers and I chuckle---- When there's a big reception and I read about\nMrs. Vogeland's pearls, and her beautiful daughter-in-law, I remember\nhow she used to run a boarding-house for miners----\n\n\"Well, I guess it's just as shoddy in the East if you go far enough\nback. Claire, you're a nice comforting body, and I hate to say it, but\nthe truth is, your great-grandfather was an hostler, and made his first\nmoney betting on horses. Now, my, I oughtn't to tell that. Do you mind,\ndearie?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. Isn't it delightful that this is such a democratic country,\nwith no castes,\" said Claire.\n\nAt this, the first break in the little old lady's undammable flood, Mrs.\nGilson sprang up, yammering, \"The rest of you may stay as long as you\nlike, but if I'm to be home in time to dress for dinner----\"\n\n\"Yes, and I must be going,\" babbled Saxton.\n\nMilt noted that his lower lip showed white tooth-marks.\n\nIt must be admitted that all of them rather ignored the little old lady\nfor a moment. Milt was apologetically hinting, \"I don't really think\nBill and I'd better come to dinner this evening, Mrs. Gilson. Thanks a\nlot but---- It's kind of sudden.\"\n\nClaire again took charge. \"Not at all, Milt. Of course you're coming. It\nwas Eva herself who invited you. I'm sure she'll be delighted.\"\n\n\"Charmed,\" said Mrs. Gilson, with the expression of one who has\nswallowed castor oil and doubts the unity of the universe.\n\nThere was a lack of ease about the farewells to Aunt Harriet. As they\nall turned away she beckoned Milt and murmured, \"Did I raise the\ndickens? I tried to. It's the only solace besides smoking that a moral\nold lady can allow herself, after she gets to be eighty-two and begins\nto doubt everything they used to teach her. Come and see me, boy. Now\nget out, and, boy, beat up Gene Gilson. Don't be scared of his wife's\nhoity-toity ways. Just sail in.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Milt.\n\nHe had one more surprise before he reached the limousine.\n\nBill McGolwey, who had sat listening to everything and scratching his\ncheek in a puzzled way, seized Milt's sleeve and rumbled:\n\n\"Good-by, old hoss. I'm not going to butt in on your game and get you in\nDutch. Gosh, I never supposed you had enough class to mingle with\nelittys like this gang, but I know when I'm in wrong. You were too darn\ndecent to kick me out. Do it myself. You're best friend I ever had\nand---- Good luck, old man! God bless you!\"\n\nBill was gone, running, stumbling, fleeing past Aunt Harriet's cottage,\noff into a sandy hilltop vacancy. The last Milt saw of him was when, on\nthe skyline, Bill stopped for a glance back, and seemed to be digging\nhis knuckles into his eyes.\n\nThen Milt turned resolutely, marched down the stairs, said to his hosts\nwith a curious quietness, \"Thank you for asking me to dinner, but I'm\nafraid I can't come. Claire, will you walk a few blocks with me?\"\n\nDuring the half minute it had taken to descend the steps, Milt had\nreflected, with an intensity which forgot Bill, that he had been\nselfish; that he had thought only of the opinion of these \"nice people\"\nregarding himself, instead of understanding that it was his duty to save\nClaire from their enervating niceness. Not that he phrased it quite in\nthis way. What he had been muttering was:\n\n\"Rotten shame--me so scared of folks' clothes that I don't stand up to\n'em and keep 'em from smothering Claire. Lord, it would be awful if she\nsettled down to being a Mrs. Jeff Saxton. Got to save her--not for\nmyself--for her.\"\n\nIt may have been Aunt Harriet, it may have been Milt's resolution, but\nMrs. Gilson answered almost meekly, \"Well, if you think---- Would you\nlike to walk, Claire?\"\n\nAs he tramped off with Claire, Milt demanded, \"Glad to escape?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'm glad you refused dinner. It really has been wearing, this\ntrial by food.\"\n\n\"This is the last time I'll dare to meet the Gilsons.\"\n\n\"And I'll have to be going back East. I hope the Gilsons will forgive\nme, some day.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you didn't win them over by Aunt Hatty!\"\n\n\"No. They're probably off me for life. Oh, these horrible social\ncomplications--worse than any real danger--fire or earthquake----\"\n\n\"Oh, these complications--they don't exist! We just make 'em, like we\nmake rules for a card game. What the deuce do we care about the opinions\nof people we don't like? And who appointed these people to a fixed\nsocial position? Did the president make Saxton High Cockalorum of\nDress-Suits or something? Why, these are just folks, the same as kings\nand coal-heavers. There's no army we've got to fight. There's just you\nand me--you and I--and if we stick together, then we have all society,\nwe _are_ all society!\"\n\n\"Ye-es, but, Milt dear, I don't want to be an outcast.\"\n\n\"You won't be. In the long run, if you don't take these aristocrats\nseriously, they'll be all the more impressed by you.\"\n\n\"No. That sounds cheering, in stories and these optimistic editorials in\nthe magazines, but it isn't true. And you don't know how pleasant it is\nto be In. I've always been more or less on the inside, and thought\noutsiders dreadful. But---- Oh, I don't care! I don't care! With\nyou--I'm happy. That's all I know and all I want to know. I've just\ngrown up. I've just learned the greatest wisdom--to know when I'm\nhappy. But, Milt dear---- I say this because I love you. Yes, I do love\nyou. No, don't kiss me. Yes, it is too---- It's _far_ too public. And I\nwant to talk seriously. You can't have any idea how strong social\ndistinctions are. Don't despise them just because you don't know them.\"\n\n\"No. I won't. I'll learn. Probably America will get into the war. I'll\nbe an engineering officer. I'll learn this social dope from the\ncollege-boy officers. And I'll come to Brooklyn with shoulder-straps and\nbells on and---- Will you be waiting?\"\n\n\"Oh--yes---- But, Milt! If the war comes, you must be very careful not\nto get shot!\"\n\n\"All right, if, you insist. Good Lord, Claire. I don't know what put it\ninto my head but---- Do you realize that a miracle has happened? We're\nno longer Miss Boltwood and a fellow named Daggett. We have been, even\nwhen we've liked each other, up to today. Always there's been a kind of\nfence between us. We had to explain and defend ourselves and scrap----\nBut now we're _us_, and the rest of the world has disappeared, and----\"\n\n\"And nothing else matters,\" said Claire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF A STORY\n\n\nIt was the farewell to Claire and Jeff Saxton, a picnic in the Cascades,\nnear Snoqualmie Falls--a decent and decidedly Milt-less fiesta. Mrs.\nGilson was going to show Claire that they were just as hardy adventurers\nas that horrid Daggett person. So she didn't take the limousine, but\nmerely the seven-passenger Locomobile with the special body.\n\nThey were ever so rough and wild. They had no maid. The chauffeur was\nabsolutely the only help to the Gilsons, Claire, Jeff, and the\ntemporarily and ejaculatorily nature-loving Mrs. Betz in the daring task\nof setting out two folding camp-tables, covering them with a linen\ncloth, and opening the picnic basket. Claire had to admit that she\nwished that she could steal the picnic basket for Milt. There were\nvacuum bottles of hot coffee. There were sandwiches of anchovy and _pat\u00c3\u00a9\nde foie gras_. There were cream cakes with almonds hidden in the suave\ncream, and there was a chicken salad with huge chunks of pure white meat\nwallowing in a sea of mayonnaise.\n\nWhen the gorging was done and the cigarettes brought out (the chauffeur\npassed a spirit lamp), they stretched on rubber blankets, and groaned a\nlittle, and spoke well of nature and the delights of roughing it.\n\n\"What is it? What's wrong? They're so--oh, so polite. They don't mean\nwhat they say and they don't dare to say what they mean. Is that it?\"\nworried Claire.\n\nShe started. She discovered that she was looking at a bristle of\nrope-colored hair and a grin projected from the shelter of a manzanita\nbush.\n\n\"For the----\" she gasped. She was too startled to be able to decide what\nwas for-the. She spoke judiciously to Jeff Saxton about Upper Montclair,\nthe subway, and tennis. She rose to examine the mountains, strolled\naway, darted down a gully, and pounced on Milt Daggett with:\n\n\"How in heaven's name----\"\n\n\"Found out where you-all were going. Look! Got a bug! Rented it. Come\non! Let's duck! Drive back with me!\" At the end of the gully was a new\nTeal bug, shinier than the ancient lost chariot, but equally gay and\nuncomfortable.\n\n\"Can't. Like to, but---- Be awfully rude to them. Won't do that--not\nmore than is good for their souls--even for you. Now don't be sulky.\"\n\n\"I won't. Nev' be sulky again, because you're crazy about me, and I\ndon't have to be sulky.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am, am I! Good heavens, the inconceivable conceit of the child!\"\n\nShe turned her back. He darted to her, caught her hands behind her,\nkissed her hair, and whispered, \"You are!\"\n\n\"I am not!\"\n\n\"Well then, you're not. Lord, you're sweet! Your hair smells like\ncinnamon and clean kittens. You'd rather go bumping off in my flivver\nthan sailing in that big Loco they've got there.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" defiantly, \"I would, and I'm ashamed of myself. I'm a throw-back\nto my horrid ancestor, the betting hostler.\"\n\n\"Probably. I'm a throw-back to my ancestor the judge. I'll train you to\nmeet my fine friends.\"\n\n\"Well--upon--my--word--I---- Oh, do stop being idiotic. We talk like\nchildren. You reduce me to the rank of a gibbering schoolgirl. And I\nlike it! It's so--oh, I don't know--so darn human, I suppose. Now\nhurry--kiss me, and get out, before they suspect.\"\n\n\"Listen.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I'll accidentally meet your car along the road. Invite you to ride. All\nright?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do. Oh, we _are_ two forlorn babes in the woods! G'-by.\"\n\nShe sauntered back to the picnic, and observed, \"What is that purple\nflower up on the mountain side?\"\n\nThe big car was sedately purring back when it was insulted by an\nintermediate host of a machine that came jumping out of a side road. The\nvulgar driver hailed them with uncouth howling. The Gilsons' chauffeur\nstopped, annoyed.\n\n\"Why, hello folks,\" bawled the social bandit.\n\n\"Oh. How do you do,\" refuted Mrs. Gilson.\n\nJeff Saxton turned a ripe purple.\n\n\"How do you like my new bug, Claire? Awful little object. But I can make\nfifty an hour. Come and try it, Claire, can't you?\"\n\n\"Why----\" Claire was obviously shocked by the impropriety of the\nsuggestion. She looked at Mrs. Gilson, who was breathing as though she\nwas just going under the ether. Claire said doubtfully, \"Well---- If you\ncan get me right back to the house----\"\n\n\"Sure,\" agreed Milt.\n\nWhen the Loco was gone, Milt drove the bug to the side of the road,\nyanked up the emergency brake, and carefully kissed the girl who was\nsnuggled down into the absurd low tin-sided seat.\n\n\"Do we have to get back soon?\" he begged.\n\n\"Oh, I don't care if we never get back. Let's shoot up into the\nmountains. Side road. Let's pretend we're driving across the continent\nagain.\"\n\nFirs dashing by--rocks in the sunshine--clouds jaunty beyond the\ninviting mouth of a mountain pass--even the ruts and bumps and\nculverts--she seemed a part of them all. In the Gilsons' huge cars she\nhad been shut off from the road, but in this tiny bug, so close to\nearth, she recovered the feeling of struggle, of triumph over\ndifficulties, of freedom unbounded. And she could be herself, good or\nbad, ignorant or wise, with this boy beside her. All of which she\nexpressed in the most eloquent speech she had ever uttered, namely:\n\n\"Oh, _Milt_----!\"\n\nAnd, to herself, \"Golly, it's such a relief not to have to try to be\ngracious and aphoristic and repartistic and everything with Jeff.\"\n\nAnd, \"But I wonder if I am aphoristic and subtle? I wonder if when she\ngets the rice-powder off, Claire isn't a lot more like Milt than she\nthought?\"\n\nAnd, aloud again, \"Oh, this is----\"\n\n\"Yump. It sure is,\" Milt agreed.\n\nThey had turned from a side-road into a side-side-road. They crossed an\nupland valley. The fall rains had flooded a creek till it had cut across\nthe road, washed through the thin gravel, left across the road a shallow\nviolent stream. Milt stopped abruptly at its margin.\n\n\"Here's where we turn back, I guess,\" he sighed.\n\n\"Oh no! Can't we get across? It's only a couple of feet deep, and gravel\nbottom,\" insisted the restored adventurer.\n\n\"Yes, but look at the steep bank. Never get up it.\"\n\n\"I don't care. Let's try it! We can woggle around and dig it out\nsomehow. I bet you two-bits we can,\" said the delicate young woman whom\nMrs. Gilson was protecting.\n\n\"All right. In she goes!\"\n\nThe bug went in--shot over the bank, dipped down till the little hood\nsloped below them as though they were looping the loop, struck the\nrushing water with a splash which hurled yellow drops over Claire's rose\njersey suit, lumbered ahead, struck the farther bank, pawed at it\nfeebly, rose two inches, slipped back, and sat there with the gurgling\nwater all around it, turned into a motor-boat.\n\n\"No can do,\" grunted Milt. \"Scared?\"\n\n\"Nope. Love it! This is a real camp--the brush on the bank, and the\nstream--listen to it chuckle under the running-board.\"\n\n\"Do you like to camp with me?\"\n\n\"Love it.\"\n\n\"Say! Gee! Never thought---- Claire! Got your transportation back East?\"\n\n\"My ticket? Yes. Why?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure you can turn it in and get a refund. So that's all\nright.\"\n\n\"Are you going to let me in on the secret?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, might's well. I was just wondering---- I don't think much of\nwasting all our youth waiting---- Two-three years in engineering school,\nand maybe going to war, and starting in on an engineering job, and me\nlonely as a turkey in a chicken yard, and you doing the faithful young\nlady in Brooklyn---- I think perhaps we might get married tomorrow\nand----\"\n\n\"Good heavens, what do you----?\"\n\n\"Do you want to go back to Brooklyn Gilsonses?\"\n\n\"No, but----\"\n\n\"Dear, can't we be crazy once, while we're youngsters?\"\n\n\"Don't bombard me so! Let me think. One must be practical, even in\ncraziness.\"\n\n\"I am. I have over a thousand dollars from the garage, and I can work\nevenings--as dear Jeff suggested! We'd have a two-by-four flat----\nClaire----\"\n\n\"Oh, let me think. I suppose I could go to the university, too, and\nlearn a little about food and babies and building houses and government.\nI need to go to school a lot more than you do. Besides auction and the\npiano--which I play very badly--and clothes and how to get hold of\ntickets for successful plays, I don't know one single thing.\"\n\n\"Will you marry me, tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Well, uh----\"\n\n\"Think of Mrs. Gilson's face when she learns it! And Saxton, and that\nMrs. Betz!\"\n\nIt was to no spoken sentence but to her kiss that she added, \"Providing\nwe ever get the car out of this river, that is!\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear, my dear, and all the romantic ways I was going to propose!\nI had the best line about roses and stars and angels and everything----\"\n\n\"They always use those, but nobody ever proposed to me in a bug in a\nflood before! Oh! Milt! Life is fun! I never knew it till you kidnapped\nme. If you kiss me again like that, we'll both topple overboard. By the\nway, _can_ we get the car out?\"\n\n\"I think so, if we put on the chains. We'll have to take off our shoes\nand stockings.\"\n\nShyly, turning from him a little, she stripped off her stockings and\npumps, while he changed from a flivver-driver into a young viking, with\nbare white neck, pale hair ruffled about his head, trousers rolled up\nabove his straight knees--a young seaman of the crew of Eric the Red.\n\nThey swung out on the running-board, now awash. With slight squeals they\ndropped into the cold stream. Dripping, laughing, his clothes clinging\nto him, he ducked down behind the car to get the jack under the back\naxle, and with the water gurgling about her and splashing its\nexhilarating coldness into her face, she stooped beside him to yank the\nstiff new chains over the rear wheels.\n\nThey climbed back into the car, joyously raffish as a pair of gipsies.\nShe wiped a dab of mud from her cheek, and remarked with an earnestness\nand a naturalness which that Jeff Saxton who knew her so well would\nnever have recognized as hers:\n\n\"Gee, I hope the old bird crawls out now.\"\n\nMilt let in the reverse, raced the engine, started backward with a burst\nof muddy water churned up by the whirling wheels. They struck the bank,\nsickeningly hung there for two seconds, began to crawl up, up, with a\nfeeling that at any second they would drop back again.\n\nThen, instantly, they were out on the shore and it was absurd to think\nthat they had ever been boating down there in the stream. They washed\neach other's muddy faces, and laughed a great deal, and rubbed their\nlegs with their stockings, and resumed something of a dull and civilized\naspect and, singing sentimental ballads, turned back, found another\nroad, and started toward a peak.\n\n\"I wonder what lies beyond the top of this climb?\" said Claire.\n\n\"More mountains, and more, and more, and we're going to keep on climbing\nthem forever. At dawn, we'll still be going on. And that's our life.\"\n\n\"Ye-es, providing we can still buy gas.\"\n\n\"Lord, that's so.\"\n\n\"Speaking of which, did you know that I have a tiny bit of money--it's\nabout five thousand dollars--of my own?\"\n\n\"But---- That makes it impossible. Young tramp marrying lady of huge\nwealth----\"\n\n\"No, you don't! I've accepted you. Do you think I'm going to lose the\none real playmate I've ever had? It was so lonely on the Boltwoods'\nbrown stoop till Milt came along and whistled impertinently and made the\nsolemn little girl in frills play marbles and---- Watch out for that\nturn! Heavens, how I have to look after you! Is there a class in cooking\nat your university? No--do--not--kiss--me--on--a--turn!\"\n\nThis is the beginning of the story of Milt and Claire Daggett.\n\nThe prelude over and the curtain risen on the actual play, they face the\nanxieties and glories of a changing world. Not without quarrels and\nbarren hours, not free from ignorance and the discomfort of finding that\nbetween the mountain peaks they must for long gray periods dwell in the\ndusty valleys, they yet start their drama with the distinction of being\nable to laugh together, with the advantage of having discovered that\nneither Schoenstrom nor Brooklyn Heights is quite all of life, with the\ncosmic importance to the tedious world of believing in the romance that\nmakes youth unquenchable.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\nB.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":676,"split":"train"}
