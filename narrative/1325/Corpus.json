{"ori_id":"a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4","title":"The Artist (film)","context":"The Artist (film)\n In 1927, silent film star George Valentin is posing for pictures outside the premiere of his latest hit film when a young woman, Peppy Miller, accidentally bumps into him. Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off with Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of Variety with the headline \"Who's That Girl?\" Later, Peppy auditions as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from the studio boss, Al Zimmer. While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry, despite her being merely an extra. With a little guidance from Valentin (he draws a beauty spot on her, which will eventually be her trademark, after finding her in his dressing room), Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.\nTwo years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience), but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, financing it himself. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film as well as the 1929 Stock Market Crash. Now Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately audiences flock to Peppy's film instead and Valentin is ruined. His wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet\/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star.\nLater, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction off all of his personal effects, and after realizing he has not paid loyal Clifton in over a year, gives him the car and fires him, telling him to get another job. Depressed and drunk, Valentin angrily sets a match to his private collection of his earlier films. As the nitrate film quickly blazes out of control he is overwhelmed by the smoke and passes out inside the burning house, still clutching a single film canister. However, Valentin's dog attracts the help of a nearby policeman, and after being rescued Valentin is hospitalized for injuries suffered in the fire. Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one with them dancing together. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house, to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. Valentin seems to remain dismissive of Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to sternly remind Valentin of his changing luck.\nPeppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if Zimmer does not agree to her terms. After Valentin learns to his dismay that it had been Peppy who had purchased all his auctioned effects, he returns in despair to his burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives, panicked, and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun. Peppy tells him she only wanted to help him. They embrace and Valentin tells her it's no use; no one wants to hear him speak. Remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let them make a musical together.\nNow the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls out audibly, \"Cut!\" to which Zimmer adds: \"Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me one more?\" Valentin, in his only audible line, replies \"With pleasure!\" revealing his French accent. The camera then pulls back to the sounds of the film crew as they prepare to shoot another take.\n<html>\n<head><title>Artist, The Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Artist, The script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Artist, The script, Artist, The movie script, Artist, The film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

by\n\n                       Michel Hazanavicius\n\n\n\n\n    Silent film, illustrated musically, with some title cards to\n    indicate the dialogues, with actors whose lips move when they\n    speak although we never hear their voices. The images are in\n    black and white, in format 1.33.\n\n\n<b>1   TITLES                                                       1\n<\/b>\n    The letters of the titles come up on a title card typical of\n    the 1920s. Elegant motifs around the edge of the frame, and,\n    in the background, there are geometrical shapes reminiscent\n    of the light beams of a film premi\u00e8re. Behind is a stylized\n    town. The titles end in a fade to black. On black, the date\n    appears on the screen: 1927\n\n\n<b>2   INT. LABORATORY - DAY                                        2\n<\/b>\n    In a \"futuristic\" 1920s laboratory, a man in tail coat and\n    bow tie is being tortured. Ultrasound is being piped into his\n    ears. It's incredibly painful! He's screaming.\n\n    Title card:\n    I'm not telling!   I won't talk!!!\n\n    His torturers, cold men of science in white coats, gradually\n    increase the volume. The pain seems unbearable, the volume\n    reaches level 10 (maximum), the man passes out!\n\n\n<b>3   INT. CELLS & CORRIDORS - DAY                                 3\n<\/b>\n    Guards wearing long leather overcoats throw the man into a\n    cell!\n\n    As the man is lying there on the ground, a dog wiggles\n    through the bars at the window. The dog, a Jack Russell,\n    jumps on top of the man - visibly his master - and begins to\n    lick his face. The man opens one eye! When he sees his dog,\n    he can't help cracking a smile...\n\n    The man, now on his feet, looks in pain. Despite the pain, he\n    motions to his dog who begins to bark in lively fashion.\n\n    Outside the cell, the guard looks curious about the noise. He\n    goes to the door, opens the spy flap and finds himself face\n    to face with the man, eye to eye just a couple of inches\n    apart! The man moves his eyes in such a way that he\n    hypnotizes the guard! Superimposed on the screen: a spinning\n    black and white spiral, until the dazed guard take his keys,\n    opens the door and releases the man and his dog.\n<b>                                                                 2.\n<\/b>\n\n    The man (the hero, thus) imprisons the guard without harming\n    him, then runs over to the guard's desk. His ears are still\n    causing him pain, but he opens a drawer and takes out his\n    belongings: a top hat which he snaps open, and a mask, which\n    he puts over his head to conceal his eyes.\n\n    We catch up with the masked man walking down corridors. He\n    suddenly stops, copied by his dog who follows him like his\n    shadow. The man, on his guard, has spotted another guard\n    where two corridors meet.\n\n    With a look, he orders his dog to move forwards into the\n    guard's line of sight. The guard looks over at the animal.\n    Using his fingers, the hero pretends to shoot his dog. The\n    dog collapses, plays dead. The guard, increasingly curious,\n    gets to his feet. He slowly approaches the motionless dog.\n    When he comes close he is attacked from the side by the hero,\n    who quickly puts him out of action with a mere punch!\n\n    The masked man then rushes to another cell, and releases a\n    young female prisoner. She too is wearing evening dress. As\n    she is thanking him he staggers and clutches his ears in\n    pain. She's concerned.\n\n    Title card:\n    Can I help you in some way?\n\n    He refuses.\n\n    Title card:\n    No. I don't get helped.   I give the help around here.\n\n    He composes himself. She casts him an admiring glance. Then,\n    in view of the urgency of their situation, they escape at a\n    run.\n\n\n<b>4   EXT.

A soldier\n    approaches, listens and suddenly understands! He grabs hold of\n    his gun and goes out onto the air field, only to find the\n    fugitives! He tries to shoot at them as he draws closer, but\n    the hero manages to throw an airplane propeller at him, before\n    climbing inside where the woman and dog are waiting for him.\n\n    The airplane begins to move.\n\n    The soldier shoots.\n\n    The airplane is positioning itself on the runway, while the\n    soldier continues to fire!\n\n    The aircraft gains speed.\n\n    The soldier is still shooting, but too late, as the heroo pulls\n    back the joystick, and the airplane takes to the sky...\n\n    The soldier is furious, but the hero is all smiles as he looks\n    back towards the ground and shouts something.\n\n    Title card: Free Georgia forever!!!\n\n    The airplane flies away into the evening sky.\n\n\n<b>8   EXT.

Behind him, the women is sleeping,\n    the dog is lying in her arms. Suddenly she is awoken by\n    explosions happening close by! Pandemonium! The man doesn't\n    understand it either, he tries to pick up altitude, but quickly\n    notices that the explosions are in fact pretty and\n    inoffensive. He consults a calendar dial on the control panel\n    that shows it is July 14th, immediately understands, and\n    bursts into laughter.\n\n    Title card: We've arrived, welcome to France!!!\n<b>                                                               4.\n<\/b>\n\n     As the music picks up the tune of The Marseillaise, the\n     airplane flies away through the exploding fireworks...\n\n     The words \"The End\" appear on the screen.\n\n\n<b>9    INT. WINGS MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                   9\n<\/b>\n     From the moment they parked the car onwards, we become\n     absorbed by what's happening around the screening of end of\n     this film.\n\n     Behind the screen, we've seen the actor who plays the hero -\n     his name is George Valentin - closely studying the reactions\n     of the audience. He was standing close to his dog, motioning\n     to it not to make a noise. The dog's name is Jack.\n\n     In the same area, we've also seen the lead actress. Her name\n     is Constance Gray. She too looks tense and is latched onto\n     the arm of a pleasant-looking man who is chewing anxiously on\n     a cigar. The man looks rich, but a little weak. He's surely\n     the producer.\n\n\n<b>10   INT. MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                     10\n<\/b>\n     In the house, much of the audience is open-mouthed, excited,\n     immobile and often wide-eyed.\n\n     In the pit, a symphony orchestra plays to accompany the film.\n\n     (9) Now that the film is ending, and the last note is\n     sounding, the cast anxiously awaits the audience's verdict,\n     which, after two or three seconds of silence, bursts into\n     thunderous applause, to the great joy of the actor and the\n     people around him, especially the actress and the producer,\n     who kiss each other on the lips.\n\n     Two theater hands bring down the curtain.\n\n     (10) The lights come on. George Valentin comes onto the stage\n     and acknowledges the audience, they are cheering for him. He\n     is so happy he dances a few tap steps to express his joy then\n     he acknowledges the orchestra before finally motioning to\n     someone in the wings to join him. Jack the dog trots over in\n     response. The crowd laughs and cheers, George waves to the\n     dog, Jack waves back then waves at the audience, the people\n     are loving it!\n\n     In the wings, Constance is fuming with rage, but on stage,\n     George is pretending with his fingers to pull at the dog, who\n     fakes death.

It's Constance. She comes over, smiling to the\n     audience, and says something to George with a smile.\n\n     Title card: I'll get you for that.\n\n     She waves, but we can tell that her smile is set between her\n     teeth. She isn't feeling comfortable. George motions firing a\n     gun with his fingers, but she does not fall down, merely\n     casts him a \"very funny\" glance. George looks at his fingers,\n     not understanding why they don't work anymore then mimes\n     throwing them away behind him, as though they've become\n     useless. Constance stalks back off into the wings in\n     annoyance, but the audience is ecstatic. Once in the wings,\n     the actress sticks up her middle finger at George, and\n     exaggeratedly mouths so he can read her lips: \"Put this up\n     your ass.\" George, grinning broadly, responds by clapping his\n     hands in applause, then leaves the stage, executing a few\n     more dance steps as he does so. The audience is delighted.\n\n     As he comes off stage, George gets soundly told off by\n     Constance, but, still grinning, he motions towards the\n     audience who are still asking for more. The producer,\n     although delighted by the successful reception, makes a weak\n     attempt to calm the actress down. As for George, he returns\n     to the stage, the audience roars. He pretends to want to\n     leave the stage, and mimes bumping into an invisible wall\n     just as he's leaving the stage. George holds his nose, the\n     audience goes wild, Constance gets even madder, and while\n     George carries on clowning about, the producer too breaks\n     into a beaming smile. He's probably realized that George has\n     the audience on his side... Constance, furious, storms off. She\n     is followed by the producer who is trying to placate her,\n     although it looks like he's got his work cut out for him.\n\n\n<b>11   EXT.

The\n     entrance is lit up, there are crowds gathered on the sidewalk,\n     cops are guarding the red carpet with a cordon of bodies, etc.\n\n     George comes out, causing the crowds, mainly young women, to\n     press forwards - and the photographers' flashes to spark into\n     life. The cops are struggling to maintain control of the\n     situation as George poses for the photographers and waves at\n     his many fans.\n<b>                                                               6.\n<\/b>\n\n     In the crowd, a young woman right at the front is staring at\n     him in rapture. She drops her bag and, as she bends to pick it\n     up, a swell in the crowd pushes her underneath the arms of the\n     policeman in front of her, out of the crowd and into George.\n     She stares at him, more in love than ever, delighted to be\n     there. The police wait for someone to give orders. George\n     doesn't quite know what to do. Nobody moves. The young woman\n     finally bursts out laughing, which, after a moment of shock,\n     causes George to laugh too, thus placating the cops and tacitly\n     signaling to the photographers that they can take pictures of\n     the scene. The flashes seem to lend the woman self-confidence\n     who, in a very carefree manner, begins to clown about in front\n     of them. George is delighted at the sight, by the whole scene\n     and, realizing this, the young woman steals a kiss. Flash. The\n     image becomes static, then dissolves into the printed picture\n     on the front page of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" newspaper, along\n     with three other pictures of the scene and the headline WHO'S\n<b>     THAT GIRL?\n<\/b>\n\n<b>12   INT.

We are in the large\n     dining room of an ultra-luxurious Hollywood villa. All around\n     her are magnificent furniture, superb paintings and objets\n     d'art, including a beautiful trio of monkeys, one hiding its\n     eyes, one with hands clasped to its ears and the third\n     obscuring its mouth. George comes into the room and kisses\n     his wife. She responds with cold indifference. You could cut\n     the atmosphere with a knife. The woman hands George the\n     newspaper. He knows what's up but tries to laugh it off. She\n     doesn't find it funny, is as cold as stone and barely looks\n     at him. She is obviously extremely annoyed with him. George\n     picks up his dog and puts it on the table. Jack drops his\n     head to one side and his big eyes implore seem to implore her\n     forgiveness. It's the exact expression of someone asking to\n     be loved, but Doris is implacable. She gets up, walks away\n     and does not turn back. Left on his own, George has a closed\n     expression on his face. He seems unhappy to have hurt his\n     wife's feelings. Then he realizes that Jack is on the table\n     in a ridiculous pose, and signals to him to get down. The dog\n     obeys. George looks at the paper, the cause of his problems.\n\n\n<b>13   EXT.

But the people around her - from working and\n     middle class backgrounds - are visibly on their way to work and\n     remain impervious to her game.\n\n     She - carefully - puts the paper away in her bag, in which four\n     or five copies of the newspaper are already carefully tucked\n     away, then gets off the bus at the next stop.\n\n\n<b>15   EXT.

There are mums with kids,\n     guys with animals, men dressed as cowboys, etc. Peppy is\n     among them, sitting next to a man of about sixty who is\n     dressed in a highly stylized fashion. His job is obviously\n     that of a butler. Peppy proudly shows him the picture in the\n     newspaper. The man leans to take a closer look, unfolds the\n     newspaper, sees the headline, smiles and then folds it back\n     up again and returns it to Peppy text-side-up, highlighting\n     the headline: Who's that girl ?\n\n     Peppy is a bit annoyed to have been put in her place, but\n     deep down she knows he's right. Nobody knows who she is. She\n     puts the newspaper away.\n\n     A man who visibly works for the studio, some assistant or\n     other, comes into the courtyard, climbs on a crate and makes\n     an announcement.\n\n     Title card: Contemporary film!   Five girls who can dance!\n\n     All the men who had pressed forwards turn on their heels,\n     leaving the assistant surrounded only by women. The man says\n     something to one girl, who begins to dance. He motions to her\n     that it's ok and she heads off towards the wardrobe section.\n     He does the same with a second girl and she gets hired too.\n     Then it's Peppy's turn. She puts a lot of energy into a few\n     top class tap steps, impressing the guy to such an extent\n     that he smiles admiringly then signals that she's hired.\n\n     Full of self-assurance that her lucky day has come, Peppy\n     heads off towards wardrobe too; swinging, her hips as she\n     pauses in front of the butler.\n<b>                                                                  8.\n<\/b>\n\n      Title card: The name is Miller.

He has a white face and\n      dark lips and eyes. His chauffeur is signing autographs for\n      him on full length photographs of himself (George) with his\n      dog. George says to him:\n\n      Title card: Go and buy a piece of jewelry for my wife. A nice\n      piece, to make it up to her.\n\n      The chauffeur nods. Having finished his mask up, George,\n      picks up a photo, looks at it closely and then writes on it.\n      As he leaves the dressing room, we see the photograph.

The producer whom we saw the\nprevious day at the premi\u00e8re arrives. His name is Zimmer, and\nhe's flanked by - and followed around at every moment by -\ntwo secretaries and two assistants. One of them hands him The\nHollywood Reporter, and Zimmer, before he's even come to a\nhalt, talks to George as he shows him the front page. He is\nvisibly upset. George looks a lot more relaxed, he says hello\nand vaguely tries to reassure him. But Zimmer persists, still\npointing at the newspaper.\n\nTitle card: Because of this childish nonsense, there's\nnothing about the film before page 5!\n\nBehind George, the two set hands come back with a new screen\nof sky scenery, and wait, standing just next to George. As\nthey are holding it, there is a three foot gap underneath.\nWhile the producer is talking to him, George's attention is\ndrawn by a lovely pair of women's legs that have come to\nstand behind the screen, the top half of the body being\nhidden by it. George acknowledges the sight with a smile and\nis about to bring his attention back to the on-going\ndiscussion, when his attention is drawn away again by a\nnoise, that of the tap steps the female legs are making,\npresumably as a warm up. George smiles in recognition and\nresponds with a few tap steps of his own. The women's legs\ninstantly stop, seem to think a moment and then answer back,\nbut with a jump in the complexity of the steps. A tap\ndialogue ensues between the two pairs of legs, until the set\nhands - the path before them now cleared - pick up their\nscreen of scenery and walk off with it. The screen moves away\nand as it disappears reveals that the upper body belongs to a\nyoung woman. She pulls a face meaning 'Here I am!!' And of\ncourse it's Peppy, except that she immediately realizes who\nshe is dealing with - visibly she wasn't expecting this at\nall - and feels completely ridiculous and uncomfortable.\n\nHer joyful expression gradually becomes one of abject\napology, but George is roaring with laughter.\n\nAfter a short pause, Zimmer makes the connection. He checks\nthe front page of the paper, and recognizes her!\n\nThen he begins shouting at her and all she can do is lower\nher head, unable to reply. He gestures that she's fired and\nfor her to get out, and she starts to go, completely\ndistraught. She's just made a couple of steps when George\nstops her and tells her to come back. Everyone is surprised,\nmost of all him. Zimmer can't believe it, and so doesn't\nrespond at first.\n<b>                                                              10.\n<\/b>\n\n     There's bad feeling between them, as though neither wanted\n     this sudden conflict, but like it had always been there,\n     tangible. Everyone on the set seems to be waiting for Zimmer\n     to react, but to their surprise, after a long moment of\n     hesitation, he walks away without saying a thing. Peppy looks\n     at George gratefully, smiling, but seems a little preoccupied\n     as though she might have made a mistake.\n\n     Everyone on set gets back to work.\n\n\n<b>20   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY        20\n<\/b>\n     They're about to start shooting. The director is showing\n     George what he has to do. The scene is happening in a cabaret\n     restaurant. George has to cross a dance floor, but each time he\n     is stopped by a guy ringing a bell to signal it is time to\n     change dancing partner. George finds himself dancing with\n     Peppy one moment, and in the arms of a very fat man the next,\n     the director finds the gag hysterical. The scene is shot\n     several times from three different angles. Each time, George\n     dances with Peppy, and, each time, the nature of their rapport\n     changes. To begin with, they are happy and laughing, but then,\n     with time, less so. Then they become embarrassed, and then\n     things get worse. We start the sequence again and again, to the\n     sound of the clapperboard counting the number of takes, but the\n     eroticism between them is the only thing that stands out from\n     the scene, every thing else goes unnoticed. Ultimately, no\n     flirting or suggestiveness has gone on, just the very obvious\n     beginning of feelings between them that they find disturbing.\n     It's probably love.\n\n\n<b>21   INT.

Then she\n     attentively looks around the dressing room. She looks at the\n     objects and photos and notices, hanging from a coat stand,\n     George's jacket on a hanger, and his hat which sits on a hook\n     above it. The way the clothes are disposed looks like George's\n     silhouette, except that the clothes are empty. She goes over,\n     strokes the jacket and little by little brings George to life\n     through his clothes.\n<b>                                                              11.\n<\/b>\n\n     She puts her right hand into the sleeve and touches her own\n     waist. As it's George's sleeve, she makes it look like his arm\n     has come to life, as though George has come to life. Even more\n     so since her left hand is stroking the jacket as though George\n     were inside. She takes pleasure from the embrace and, when\n     George comes into the room, she slowly removes her hand without\n     any rush. George sees her, they look at each other. He closes\n     the door but doesn't go over to her, instead going over to the\n     mirror. He looks at her, she at him... He motions to her to\n     approach. She does. He stares at her face for a while before he\n     speaks.\n\n     Title card: If you want to be an actress, you need to have\n     something no one else has.\n\n     He takes a make-up pencil and draws a beauty spot above her\n     upper lip. She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles. She\n     likes it. She turns towards him and, quite naturally, folds\n     into his arms. The dog watches them curiously with its head\n     leaning to one side. They are probably about to kiss when\n     George's chauffeur comes into the room and catches them.\n     George swiftly moves aside and there is a moment of\n     discomfort. The chauffeur unwraps a parcel and takes out a\n     large and beautiful pearl necklace. George is intrigued by\n     the necklace, and turns away from Peppy. She understands that\n     George has his own life, that their embrace was just a stolen\n     moment and slowly leaves, looking back at George as she does\n     so. He does not look at her. She leaves the room. Once he has\n     studied and necklace and is satisfied, George turns back\n     towards Peppy but she is no longer there. The chauffeur exits\n     the room.\n\n     When he is alone, George looks at himself in the mirror. His\n     expression shows that he things he is the stupidest man in\n     the world. He mimes shooting himself in the temple with his\n     fingers, but it's the dog which collapses into its play-dead\n     pose.\n\n\n<b>23   INT.

George watches\n     her, smiles and continues to watch. Except it's not Doris he's\n     watching. Instead it's Peppy who's tucking into her food and\n     talking and laughing vivaciously. George is with her with an\n     expression of love on his face. He's laughing with her when,\n     suddenly, reality bites. He's still sitting opposite Doris,\n     and she's staring at him because she doesn't understand why he\n     is laughing. She visibly finds him ridiculous.

The room goes dark.\n     The screening begins.\n\n\n<b>32                                                                32\n<\/b><b>     INT.

She's standing in front of a mic and she\n     tests it, delighted to be there. Cut. We see her again, the\n     microphone has disappeared and she acts out a scene. It's a\n     monologue. Her acting is terrible, very theatrical, but the\n     audience can hear her. It is however, awful.\n\n     (31) In the screening room, the audience seems stunned by\n     what they see\/hear. They are fascinated. They then begin to\n     congratulate each other and slap Zimmer on the back. Zimmer's\n     pride seems to grow by the second.\n\n     George, who at first seemed very surprised, slowly begins a\n     snigger which gradually has become a belly laugh when the\n     actress earnestly ends her monologue.\n<b>                                                              14.\n<\/b>\n\n     When the lights come up, George is laughing uncontrollably\n     way beyond the bounds of mere mockery as his sincerity is\n     obvious. The people present are embarrassed, and Zimmer is\n     deeply put out. George, still laughing, leaves the room,\n     waving an apology with his hands as he goes, but also\n     pointing to the screen to explain why he's laughing. Zimmer\n     feels even more humiliated. Fade to black on his face.\n\n\n<b>33   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY      33\n<\/b>\n     We're back with George in his dressing room. He's removing his\n     make up. He moves some ordinary object and the object, as he\n     moves it, makes a noise. We hear the noise it makes. Really\n     hear it. It's the first time we've heard a sound that comes\n     from within the film itself. One second later, George realizes\n     that the object made a noise. He moves it again, the object\n     makes a noise again. George is worried. He tries another object\n     and obtains noise again. His dog barks and we hear it! He gets\n     up (chair makes a noise) and says something to his dog, but no\n     sound comes out of his mouth when he speaks. He realizes\n     this... Panic sets in, he turns to the mirror and tries talking\n     again, but still no sound comes out. Not understanding what's\n     happening, the feeling of panic fully blossoms and he flees his\n     dressing room!\n\n\n<b>34   INT.

George tries to talk to them\n     but his voice remains silent. One dancer, seeing his fright,\n     bursts into throaty laughter. George rushes through the\n     milling crowd the sound of which is becoming increasingly\n     loud...\n\n\n<b>35   EXT.

In front of him a feather eddies\n     slowly to the ground, carried by the breeze. It finally lands,\n     making a completely abnormal and disproportionate noise like\n     that of a building crashing to the ground in slow motion.\n     George screams, but again his cry is silent.\n\n\n<b>36   INT.

George is watching it drift\n     to the ground when suddenly a gust of wind sends it soaring\n     back into the sky. George follows it with his eyes and notices\n     a man crossing between two sets. He looks like some kind of set\n     hand or assistant; a working man in any case. George calls to\n     him. The two men draw close and George asks him what's\n     happening. The man takes the day's newspaper out of his pocket\n     and hands it to George before walking off. George reads:\n     Kinograph Studios stop all silent productions to work\n     exclusively on talkies.\n\n\n<b>42   INT.

They are probably\n     engineers in view of the attention being given to the plans\n     lying on the desk. Everyone is surprised by George's rude\n     entry. The engineers seem embarrassed, but Zimmer smiles and\n     politely asks them to leave, as though asking for their\n     understanding. As they head for the door, some of them drop\n     their heads so as not to meet George's eyes, whereas others\n     look him right between the eyes but without any love lost. This\n     exchange causes a strange, unpleasant feeling within him. He\n     seems embarrassed. It's perhaps due to the rudeness of his\n     eruption into the office, but it's more likely due to the looks\n     he's been given. For the first time for ages, he has not been\n     looked at how a star is normally looked at - with respect,\n     desire and admiration - but like any ordinary man is looked at\n     or, worse still, how a superfluous man is looked at.\n\n     As George realizes that his status has just changed, Zimmer\n     invites him to sit down. Then speaks to him, in a friendly\n     manner.\n\n     Title card: We belong to another age, you and I, George.\n     Nowadays, the world talks.\n\n     He talks to him, looks a little embarrassed, while George\n     takes it on the chin, not knowing how to respond.\n\n     Title card: People want to see new faces. Talking faces.\n\n     George reaches deep down into himself and makes an effort to\n     bring up a smile.\n\n     Title card: Paramount will be delighted. They still want me.\n\n     Zimmer responds with a pursing of the lips that is more\n     damning than any counter argument could be. As though he's\n     telling George he can always give it a go... George understands\n     what's happening. Zimmer is sorry.\n\n     Title card: I'm sorry. The public wants fresh blood. And the\n     public is never wrong.\n\n     George gets to his feet.\n\n     Title card: It's me the people want and it's my films they\n     want to see. And I'm going to give them to them.\n\n     Zimmer nods with another pursing of the lips, as though he\n     can't wait to see that. George seems very sure of himself.\n\n     Title card: I don't need you.

Among the medallion framed young portraits, George\n     recognizes that of Peppy Miller.

She is coming up, he is\n     going down. When she notices him, she stops, already one step\n     above of him. She has a beaming smile and is truly delighted to\n     see him.

It takes a\n     while and is a little chaotic, she apologizes, but he visibly\n     takes a lot of pleasure out of watching her. She finally gets\n     the number down and hands it to him, telling him to call her -\n     to really call her. In response he casts a glance over to the\n     young men waiting for her higher up the stairs, and she\n     bursts out laughing. She leans towards him to say something.\n\n     Title card: Gadgets!\n\n     She looks at him flirtatiously. Then she gestures again for\n     him to call her, and he nods, even though we think that he\n     probably will not do so. She leaves and he watches her go\n     before beginning his decent once more. Once at the top, she\n     turns back to call out to George, he too has turned to look.\n     She smiles at him, breaks into a few tap steps for old time's\n     sake, then blows him a kiss.\n<b>                                                              18.\n<\/b>\n\n     He catches the kiss with a smile, pretends to make it\n     disappear in his other hand like a magician, then shows her\n     the inside breast pocket of his jacket as proof that he's\n     keeping it safe and warm. She laughs loudly and goes on her\n     way.

His dog\n     has a role in the film too, doing tricks. George looks very\n     happy, very committed. He takes a supple branch, feeds it\n     through the sleeves of a woman's blouse and, by holding the two\n     ends of the branch out in front of him, dances with the\n     imaginary woman.

I never loved you...\n\n     It's obvious he's only saying that so that she can forget him\n     and move on with her life, but it doesn't wash and the young\n     woman weeps all the more, terribly moved by this last\n     sacrifice on his part.\n\n     (63) In the balcony, Peppy is speechless and her face\n     impassive.\n\n     (64) On screen, George and the young women exchange a last\n     glance as George's face gradually sinks into the sand.\n\n     (63) Next to Peppy, the young man sits watching her.

Only\n     one hand stays in the air for several seconds more in a\n     tortured pose, that of a dying man trying to hold on to the\n     wind.\n\n     (63) Peppy's companion seems to find the film far too long\n     and doesn't understand why they haven't already left.\n\n     (64) The hand has disappeared. The young woman is in a state\n     of shock, rigid with a look of horror on her face. She is no\n     doubt about to be put to certain death. The dog turns round\n     and walks off with head and tail lowered...\n\n     The End appears on the screen.\n\n     (63) Peppy seems moved.

She continues.\n\n     Title card: I saw Tears of Love.\n\n     George nods, and answers.\n\n     Title card: And so you've come to get your money back?\n\n     She smiles stiffly, not knowing how to react.   He continues.\n\n     Title card: Too much face-pulling?\n\n     She stops smiling because it's not funny at all. It's bitter,\n     even. There's an embarrassed silence.

He's\n     watching the arrival of the young, smiling, handsome and\n     wholesome man who is with Peppy. George bears a melancholy\n     smile.\n\n     Title card: You're right.

My Dad just loves you.\n\n     He says it very nicely, with no ulterior motive, but George\n     is cut to the quick. The comment wounds him and Peppy\n     notices. She cuts short the meeting by smiling and upping the\n     cheerfulness stakes, as though to kid George she hasn't\n     noticed any embarrassment or perceived anything that might\n     have shocked or hurt him during their encounter.\n\n     Title card: OK! Well, we'll be off now.   I'll call you soon.\n     Bye!\n\n     George smiles politely. She leaves, taking the handsome jock\n     with her. George watches them leave. As does his dog, who\n     sits with his head and ears hanging low as though very\n     disappointed. George watches Peppy walking away, then steps\n     forwards and sits down on the steps leading up to the house.\n<b>                                                              25.\n<\/b>\n\n     As she gets into the car, Peppy seems surly, unhappy even,\n     for the first time.

The date is superimposed\n     on the screen: 1931.\n\n     The camera climbs up his legs to reveal George lying fully\n     dressed in his bed, obviously at home in view of his attitude.\n     He's changed. And even if his suit is still pretty smart, he's\n     become more \"common\", less unattainable. He seems to have lost\n     whatever it was that made him so superb. Primarily he's a bit\n     drunk, somewhat hesitant. George gets up and closes his Murphy\n     bed, the kind of bed that slots up into the wall to look like a\n     closet. Then he walks across the living area. His home has\n     changed too, it's fallen in class and is a lot more modest than\n     the one we were used to seeing him in. We do however recognize\n     some of the objects, furniture and paintings from his old\n     house, notably the huge portrait of him smiling. He goes into\n     the kitchen which is open onto the rest of the apartment.\n     There's nothing in the refrigerator. He looks for something to\n     drink but there's only one bottle left in the rack. He lifts it\n     up. It's empty.\n\n     He opens a closet.

The pawnbroker counts out the bills and\n     hands them to George who, in a fit of pride, leaves a tip as\n     he leaves - his dignity intact even in the face of adversity.\n\n\n<b>75   INT.

The\n     objects go under the hammer one by one. We see the three\n     monkeys go by, notably, hear no evil, speak no evil, see no\n     evil. Two buyers especially are raising the prices by bidding\n     against each other, a distinguished and reserved-looking man,\n     and a lady of a certain age who looks a bit severe, to the\n     point of bigotry. They don't seem perfectly comfortable, but\n     they are the only two buying.\n\n     A few crossfades (the display table emptying, faces, hands\n     being raised, hammer falling, \"sold\" labels) show us the lots\n     disappearing - every single item is sold.\n\n\n<b>82   INT.

George is becoming more and more\n     frenzied. The floor is now covered in cans and film. He\n     stops, dripping with sweat. Worriedly, he looks around for a\n     moment. Then he strikes a match, takes a second to consider\n     what he's about to do and throws the match into the middle of\n     the reels.\n\n     There's madness in his eyes as he watches the fire take hold.\n     We can see his pleasure at seeing the flames spread. But he's\n     very quickly overrun. The reels burst into flames in an\n     instant and give off lots of smoke. Jack is panicking and\n     barks incessantly. Suddenly, George seems to lose it. He\n     doesn't know what to do anymore and, although the fire is\n     spreading quite spectacularly around him, he runs to where\n     the reels and films that he has not opened are, and begins\n     throwing them frantically over his shoulder as though he's\n     looking for one in particular. The ever-increasing denseness\n     of the smoke, however, is making the task almost impossible.\n     On the floor, below the smoke, Jack flees the room and runs\n     off while George suffocates but continues to struggle with\n     the cans of reels.\n\n\n<b>92   EXT.

He collapses, still holding on to the can.\n\n\n<b>93   EXT. POLICEMAN JUNCTION - DAY                                93\n<\/b>\n     Jack spots a cop at a junction. He takes hold of the cop's\n     trouser leg with his teeth and tries to pull him towards\n     George's house. The policeman doesn't understand, however, and\n     pushes it away with his foot. The dog persists and barks but\n     the cop just wants to be left in peace.\n\n     (91) George is suffocating on the floor. The level of smoke\n     is getting ever lower and is slowly covering his face.\n<b>                                                              32.\n<\/b>\n\n     (93) Jack barks louder and louder. The policeman feels\n     uncomfortable. A woman is watching the scene inquisitively.\n     Not knowing what to do, the cop motions to the dog to be\n     silent and threatens it with two fingers, just like George\n     miming a pistol. Jack collapses and plays dead. The cop has\n     no idea what's happened, he crouches down and touches the dog\n     to see if it's all right. Jack wakes up and goes to leave but\n     stops immediately to show the cop he wants to take him with\n     him. The cop still doesn't understand, it's the woman who\n     tells him what he must do. The cop seems to understand, has a\n     moment of doubt, and then starts following the dog. Jack\n     encourages him to go faster, but the cop resists to begin\n     with. Little by little though, as though realizing the\n     seriousness of the situation, he speeds up. More and more,\n\n\n<b>94   EXT.

She hangs up, pensive for a moment. On set,the\n     director gestures to his assistant that the shot is ready and\n     they are good to go.

His dog is at the foot of the bed, asleep.\n      George is on a drip, unconscious and covered in bandages. A\n      doctor is in the room with a nurse.\n\n      Peppy enters. She's anxious but the doctor seems reassuring.\n\n      Title card: He's not in any danger now. He just needs to\n      rest.\n\n      Peppy goes up to George. She notices that his burnt hands\n      seem to still be clutching something. She's intrigued. In\n      response, the doctor shows her the reel of film that sits in\n      a corner of the room.\n\n      Title card: He was holding that. It was real hard to pry it\n      away from him.\n\n      Peppy picks up the can. The label is too damaged to be able\n      to read the title of the film. She opens it and unrolls some\n      of the film in front of the window. We see random photograms\n      run by. It's the only sequence they ever shot together, years\n      before. Peppy is moved. Without turning round, she asks the\n      doctor:\n\n      Title card: Do you think he could come rest up at my place?\n\n      The doctor nods with a kindly glint in his eye.\n\n      Title card: It's probably the very best he could have hoped\n      for.\n\n\n<b>102   EXT.

Then he\n      wakes up and looks around, not understanding where he is.\n\n      Jack wakes up and barks, wags his tail. A nurse who had been\n      dozing in an armchair facing the bed awakes with a start, then\n      goes over to George. She reassures him, motions to him not to\n      get upset, then slowly leaves the room before running off down\n      the corridor. She knocks at a door then goes back to George's\n      room. Peppy is close on her heels. She comes into the room in\n      her nightgown. When he sees her, George smiles and she rushes\n      over to the bed and puts her arms tight around him. She is\n      terribly moved but, when she releases him from her arms to talk\n      to him, she realizes that he has lost consciousness again and\n      so was not sharing the same special moment as she. She pulls a\n      face, afraid she might have done something wrong, glances over\n      at the nurse, then lays George's head back on his pillow.\n\n\n<b>104   INT.

She laughs, talks, eats, drinks and\n      is as vivacious as he had dreamed she would be all those years\n      before. He looks at her with a smile on his face. Then she\n      looks at her watch and realizes she needs to hurry.\n\n      Title card: I've got to go. I have to be on set for nine\n      o'clock.\n\n      George smiles kindly at her. She returns the smile but we can\n      tell that maybe reality has just reminded them that she is\n      working, and he is not. They exchange a last glance before\n      she leaves the room.\n\n      George, now alone, gets up with some difficulty. He picks up\n      a pile of folded clothes from an armchair. It's his jacket\n      and pants, both half burned. On the floor, his shoes are in\n      exactly the same state of disrepair.\n\n\n<b>105   INT.

He goes\n      along a corridor and down a wide stairway. Jack begins sniffing\n      outside of one door, as though he wants to go inside.\n<b>                                                               35.\n<\/b>\n\n<b>106   INT.

He\n      closes the door behind him. The room has a ghostly quality to\n      it. Jack sniffs about everywhere. George too seems troubled by\n      the strange pervading atmosphere. His curiosity is spurred by\n      a convoluted object that is covered in a thin cloth. A ray of\n      light surges into the room. The door has opened and, standing\n      against the daylight, is a maid.\n\n      Title card: You should go back to your room, Sir.\n\n      George nods with a smile. The maid leaves pretty swiftly, we\n      haven't seen her face, the whole moment seems rather strange.\n      George is intrigued but leaves the room. He has to call Jack\n      to him. Jack is reluctant to go but finally obeys his master.\n\n\n<b>107   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY SET - 1931 - DAY             107\n<\/b>\n      A screenplay lies on a table. Peppy and Zimmer are seated\n      either side of the table and are talking animatedly. We're on\n      the set we saw the previous day, and Peppy seems to be trying\n      to convince Zimmer of something. She seems to be describing a\n      film poster or the fa\u00e7ade of a movie theater she'd love to see.\n      He doesn't seem too enthusiastic from the looks of the negative\n      shakes of his head and his apologetic air as he listens to\n      Peppy. She finally stops talking and gives him a determined\n      look. Zimmer, uncomfortable and sorry, calmly replies.\n\n      Title card: George is a silent movie actor. He belongs to the\n      past. Today he's a nobody.\n\n      As Zimmer's speaking, she removes her accessories and hat.\n      Zimmer is so intrigued he stops talking.\n\n      Title card: What are you doing?\n\n      She looks him straight in the eyes, and answers:\n\n      Title card: I'm stopping work. It's him or me.\n\n      She looks determined. He's looking unsure of himself. He\n      visibly isn't sure he's understood properly.

The people around them\n      are listening in on their conversation and seem to be waiting\n      for his decision. There's an element of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu to the\n      situation, and Zimmer, who already backed down a few years\n      before, gives in.\n\n      Title card: And why not...\n\n      She smiles at him, picks up the screenplay with delight, and\n      leaves. As he moves away she whistles at him. He turns round\n      and she vigorously blows him a kiss.\n\n\n<b>108   INT.

At\n      first, he's delighted to see him, but this turns into\n      astonishment and he seems to ask the man a question. The\n      chauffeur answers:\n\n      Title card: I work for Miss Miller now.\n\n      George visibly doesn't know what to think and, although he\n      remains pleasant, becomes somewhat reserved. It's as though\n      something has come between them. The chauffeur places the\n      screenplay on the bedside table. George seems to greet it\n      with mistrust, certainly not with enthusiasm.\n\n      The chauffeur also has a box of cakes with him that he puts\n      on a plate for George. George doesn't want any, it's all too\n      much...\n\n      Before he leaves, the chauffeur overcomes his habitual\n      reserve for the first time and says to George:\n\n      Title card: She's been good to you. She's always looked out\n      for you.\n\n      The chauffeur leaves without trying to convince George\n      further, as the other looks on full of pride and doubt.\n<b>                                                               37.\n<\/b>\n\n<b>110   EXT.

We recognize the car as being the one that belonged\n      to George.\n\n      (109) At the window, George watches him leave. Then he seems\n      to have an idea or, more exactly, an intuition.\n\n\n<b>111   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                      111\n<\/b>\n      George goes into the room that's full of sheets. He goes\n      straight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lifts up\n      the sheet. Underneath he finds his former objet d'art, the\n      three monkeys \"hear no evil\", \"speak no evil\" and \"see no\n      evil\". He thinks for a moment, then pulls of another sheet to\n      reveal a piece of furniture. Once again it's a piece that used\n      to belong to him and we recognize it from having seen it at the\n      auction room.\n\n      After taking off several other sheets, George realizes that\n      she bought everything he had put up for sale: furniture,\n      paintings, objets d'art, souvenirs, etc. He rips off sheets\n      one after the other and the objects appear, even down to his\n      suits and tuxedos. He continues and discovers the painting\n      depicting him in a tux, waving and smiling. George looks\n      stunned at the sight of himself looking so full of life. He's\n      interrupted by the same ray of light which surges into the room\n      once more. This time, at the door, are the butler and the maid.\n\n      George walks towards them when he sees them. The closer he gets\n      to them, however, the more his expression tightens. We realize\n      that the butler is none other than the distinguished-looking\n      man who purchased everything at the auction, and that the maid\n      is the woman who was bidding against him to raise the sale\n      prices. George is looking at them as he leaves the room. He has\n      recognized them, but doesn't say anything to them. He walks\n      off, still shocked by what he's just realized.\n\n\n<b>112   INT.

With Jack by his side, he walks along\n      the sidewalk. There are a few other people walking along. About\n      twenty yards ahead of him a man is begging. He holds out his\n      hand to passers-by. George approaches and, when there are no\n      other passers-by between him and George, the beggar glances at\n      him and lowers his hand. He doesn't raise it as George\n      approaches. George stops in front of him and looks at him, but\n      the beggar motions to him to scram. George continues on his\n      way. For that moment at least, he has become one of them.\n\n      He buttons up the collar of his suit in an attempt to hide the\n      fact that he doesn't have a shirt then, heads off and loses\n      himself in the crowd. Some distance later, he stops to check\n      his reflection in a shop window. The image he sees is that of a\n      bum. It's even more striking because the in the window there is\n      a young male mannequin wearing a tux, top hat and white scarf.\n      The image of the mannequin and that of George are superimposed.\n\n      A cop comes up to George and begins talking to him in a\n      friendly manner. He speaks but we don't know what about. There\n      is not Title card. George visibly has no idea what the cop is\n      talking about. The cop seems to be talking about nothing\n      important, just chatting... He talks and talks... George\n      doesn't understand what he's saying, and doesn't understand\n      why he's talking to him. He's lost.\n\n      Title card: What did you say?\n\n      The cop smiles, carries on talking, then stops. He thinks\n      he's talking to a madman. He doesn't persist, merely sizes\n      George up and, once he's decided that he's harmless, the cop\n      walks off. George, totally bewildered by the incident, seems\n      to lose his grip on himself a little more.\n\n\n<b>115   INT.

The\n      maid seems to be telling her what happened with George, how he\n      removed all the sheets, etc. Peppy listens with an inscrutable\n      expression on her face. Then, suddenly overcome by a terrible\n      thought, she rushes outside.\n\n\n<b>118   EXT.

She honks the horn to call him but\n      there's no response. She honks the horn again, then, not\n      wanting to wait any longer, and seeing the keys on the\n      dashboard, she gets behind the wheel, starts the engine and\n      pulls off in a series of kangaroo hops. It's obvious that she\n      doesn't know how to drive all that well, but still goes at full\n      speed - more or less successfully.

George takes a\n      gulp of liquor, then puts down the glass, opens a cardboard box\n      and takes out a pistol that he places on the table in front of\n      him. He picks up the glass for another gulp. Jack doesn't like\n      what he sees. He barks.\n\n      (119) As for Peppy, she's speeding along, totally ignoring\n      even the most basic of road safety requirements.\n\n      (120) George puts down his glass and picks up the pistol.\n      Jack isn't happy at all. He barks and bites George's trouser\n      leg, pulling on it.\n\n      (119) Peppy speeding along.\n\n      (120) George puts the pistol into his mouth. Jack is barking\n      like mad. George, still in the same position, closes his\n      eyes.\n<b>                                                                40.\n<\/b>\n\n      Title card: \"BANG!\"\n\n      George is in the same position. He still has the pistol in\n      his mouth. Visibly, he's heard a BANG from outside, because\n      he takes the pistol out of his mouth and looks out the\n      window.\n\n\n<b>121   EXT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                            121\n<\/b>\n      Outside, we see Peppy's car has rammed into the gate and is\n      still shuddering. Peppy didn't brake in time, but she doesn't\n      care. She jumps out the car and runs into the house.\n\n\n<b>122   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                            122\n<\/b>\n      She rushes into the living room and stops for a moment to look\n      at George. George awkwardly tries to hide the pistol behind\n      him. She bursts into tears.\n\n      Title card: I feel so awful. I only wanted to help you. To\n      take care of you...\n\n      He seems to reply that no, it's not her fault, she's got\n      nothing to feel bad about. He opens his arms towards her,\n      still holding the pistol and the gun fires itself.\n      Fortunately no one is hurt, but the incident makes Peppy\n      laugh and, between sobs and gasps of laughter she throws\n      herself into George's arms. They hug for a long time. Peppy\n      says into his ear,\n\n      Title card: You've got so much that no one else has...\n\n      And into her ear, George replies:\n\n      Title card: No, I'm nothing but a shadow. No good for\n      anything but silence.\n\n      Peppy doesn't reply. She just holds him tighter still and\n      closes her eyes. Jack is sitting close by, watching them and\n      wagging his tail.\n\n      Outside, the shutter is still slamming and the car is still\n      shuddering. Peppy opens her eyes. Visibly, she's had an idea.\n\n      Jack wags his tail and thumps it on the ground. The shutter\n      slams. The car shudders. Peppy smiles at George.\n\n      Title card: I know what you have that no one else does.\n\n      Peppy moves away from George and motions to him to listen.\n      The shutter slams. Jacks tail thumps. The car shudders... Peppy\n      does a few tap steps. George doesn't understand.\n<b>                                                               41.\n<\/b>\n\n      Peppy starts again, with a beaming smile, waiting for his\n      response. George does a few tap steps himself, basic ones,\n      without any great enthusiasm. She smiles at him and does a\n      few more complex steps that are a lot livelier. He smiles\n      back finally understanding the golden gift that he has in his\n      feet. He looks at Peppy lovingly with a beaming smile on his\n      face.\n\n\n<b>123   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS (1931) - ZIMMER'S OFFICE - DAY     123\n<\/b>\n      Music suddenly begins to play and we see feet dancing in\n      another decor. Except that from now on we actually hear the\n      sound of the tap steps. We pull back to find Peppy and George\n      in Zimmer's office. They're dancing for him. Little by little,\n      Zimmer is convinced by them, and, when they finish their\n      demonstration, he has a broad smile on his face.\n\n\n<b>124   INT. STUDIO - PEPPY & GEORGE - DAY                        124\n<\/b>\n      We find Peppy and George on a film set, still dancing. The\n      piece of jazz they are dancing to has gone so crazy that now\n      everyone wants to get up and dance! They are dancing a tap\n      number facing the camera, in a d\u00e9cor representing a stylized\n      New York. The choreography is incredible, in the grand style\n      of the old Hollywood musicals and they finish with a knee\n      slide that brings them right up to us with big smiles on\n      their faces. The music stops on a powerful blast from the\n      brass instruments that leaves everyone bursting with energy.\n      In the ensuing silence, Peppy and George stay exactly where\n      they were, facing the camera, with the smile stuck on their\n      faces. It goes on for a little too long, they are out of\n      breath.\n\n      Then they look at someone off-shot. They are facing a film\n      crew (from their era of course). The director smiles. Zimmer,\n      sitting next to him, seems ecstatic. The director speaks and\n      we hear what he says.\n\n<b>                          DIRECTOR\n<\/b>                Cut! Excellent!\n\n      Zimmer has both his thumbs up. The director says to Peppy and\n      George.\n\n<b>                          DIRECTOR (CONT'D)\n<\/b>                Once more? Please?\n\n      George laughs and replies, and we hear him too.\n\n<b>                          GEORGE\n<\/b>                With pleasure!\n<b>                                                       42.\n<\/b>\n\n                           THE End\n\nThe credits run while Peppy and George go back to their\npositions. The camera (ours) pulls back and into frame come\nall the technicians who are setting up the shot, the hair,\nmake-up and costume people for continuity, the camera coming\ninto position, the director coming over to say a few words to\nthe star couple, in short: the shot being prepared for\nanother take. And, when everyone is in position, the director\nspeaks into his megaphone and we hear \"OK, Camera! Sound!\nRolling... and... Action!\"\n\nFade to black and the music picks up again for the end of the\ncredit sequence.\n\n<\/pre><br>\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\n  <tr> \n\t<td align=center><img src=\"\/posters\/Artist,-The.jpg\" border=0>\n\t<td><h1>Artist, The<\/h1><br><br>\n\t    <b>Writers<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Michel Hazanavicius\" title=\"Scripts by Michel Hazanavicius\">Michel Hazanavicius<\/a><br>\n    \t<b>Genres<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama<\/a><br><br><br>\n\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"\/Movie Scripts\/Artist, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Artist, The comments\">User Comments<\/a>\n\t<\/td>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img src=\"\/images\/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"  alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=1><br>\nBack to IMSDb<\/a>\n<\/div><br>\n<br><br>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<\/table>\n\n<table width=\"99%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"body\">\n  <tr> \n  <td background=\"\/images\/reel.gif\" height=\"13\" colspan=\"2\">\n<\/table>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb)\">Index<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/submit\" title=\"Submit scripts\">Submit<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/links\" title=\"Other sites\">Links<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/link to us\" title=\"Link to IMSDb\">Link to us<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/feeds\" title=\"IMSDb RSS Feeds\">RSS Feeds<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/privacy\">Privacy policy<\/a> \n<\/div>\n\n<br \/>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>","id":1325,"split":"test"}
